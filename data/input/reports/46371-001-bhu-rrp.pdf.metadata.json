The  program  will  strengthen  macro-financial  management  in  the  country  to \nensure  adequate  and  sound  development  financing  that  is  balanced  and  without  distortions. \nThis is necessary to sustain robust growth in the medium-term and facilitate Bhutan\u2019s transition \nto a middle-income country. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nBackground.  Bhutan has successfully pursued investment-led growth that builds on its \n3. \ncomparative  advantage  and  improves  socioeconomic  development.  Despite  the  impressive \ngrowth in income per capita and progress toward Millennium Development Goals over the past \nyears, there has been increasing evidence of an overheating economy. This has been reflected \nin  the  buildup  of  domestic  and  external  imbalances  and  resulting  in  the  recent  rupee  liquidity \nshortage.2  \n \n4. \nThe  program  targets  corrective  policy  measures  to  address  these  imbalances  and \nimprove macroeconomic management. The program will assist in transitioning the economy on \nto  a  sustainable  growth  track  over  the  medium-term  to  avoid  what  could  otherwise  be  a  hard \nlanding.  \n \n5. \nThe  next  3\u20135  years  will  be  critical  as  10  ongoing  and forthcoming  hydropower  projects \nundergo  construction  (para.  29).  The  critical  challenge  for  the  government  is  to  ensure  the \ntimely  completion  of  such  projects  in  order  to  develop  a  sufficiently  large  generation  of  export \nearnings  that  will  sustain  the  financing  through the  budget  of  an  increasing  demand  for  public \nservices. Strong macroeconomic management will be imperative to sustain the large investment \ndrive required to complete these projects and attract additional private investment.  \n \n6. \nDriver  of  growth.  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  performed  well  during  FY2001\u20132011,  with  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaging  8%  per  annum.  Accordingly,  per  capita  income, \nmeasured in 2,000 constant dollars, has trebled to $2,428 in 2011 from $778.30 in 2001. These \nadvances  were  driven  mainly  by  the  hydropower  sector,  which  is  the  engine  of  economic \ngrowth.3 Hydropower  contributes  a  quarter  of  Bhutan\u2019s  GDP  and  is  the  main  source  of  public \nrevenue.  \n \n7. \nTo sustain Bhutan\u2019s high economic growth trajectory and to meet its Vision 2020 goals, \nthree elements are deemed critical: (i) sound macroeconomic management; (ii) efficient, reliable, \nand  expanding  physical  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  a  strong  domestic  revenue  base.  The \ngovernment has therefore prioritized, in addition to constructing hydropower projects, improving \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   In this report, \u201crupee\u201d refers to Indian rupees. \n3  As part of Vision 2020, the government plans to add 10,000 megawatts of power generating capacity by 2020. To \nthis  end,  the  government  entered  into  a  bilateral  agreement  with  the  Government  of  India  during  the  first \nEmpowered Joint Group Meeting held in Delhi in March 2009 to develop 10 hydropower projects.   \n\n \n\n\fand  expanding  hard  and  soft  infrastructure,  including  through  investment  in  health  and \neducation under the Tenth Five-Year Development Plan.4  \n \n8. \nFinancing of growth. This ambitious buildup of public capital expenditure, especially on \nhydropower projects, has been financed largely by external development assistance. Following \non the introduction of the banking system in Bhutan in the 1970s, despite increasing income per \ncapita, the household savings and overall savings in the national economy remained relatively \nlow.  In  addition,  the  banking  system  has  largely  been  shielded  from  competition,  and  savings \nproducts  in  the  financial  system  are  largely  undeveloped,  further  inhibiting  savings  in  the \neconomy. \n \n9. \nIndia has been Bhutan\u2019s single largest bilateral and trading partner, providing 75% of its \nimports and absorbing 90% of its exports. Recently, India\u2019s share of development expenditure in \nBhutan  has  declined.  More  generally,  with  the  rise  in  Bhutan\u2019s  income  per  capita  and  overall \ndevelopment,  concessional  terms  of  assistance  from  other  development  partners  have \nhardened.  \n \nThe  transition  from  an  agrarian  to  a  modern  economy  has  increased  demands  on  the \n10. \ngovernment,  particularly  regarding  service  delivery  and  social  sector  expenditures.  This  has \nrapidly expanded public spending in the budget, which has intensified fiscal pressures and built \nup national debt. While there has been a steady growth of tax revenue, the additional revenue \ngenerated  from  hydropower  exports  has  not  fully  met  rising  demand  for  services  provided \nthrough the budget and debt servicing obligations.  \n \n11. \nEconomic imbalances. Higher household income has also contributed to robust growth \nin  private  consumption,  which,  together  with  large  public  spending  has  led  to  an  increase  in \nimports and widening of the trade deficit with India. On the financial side, the added pressure on \nconsumption has more recently led to the rapid expansion in growth of financial sector credit in \nthe  economy  which  has  been  outpacing  nominal  GDP  growth  rate.5 While  inflation  has  been \nrecently increasing, the resulting pressure has been most clearly manifested in a rupee liquidity \ncrunch in the local economy. \n \n12. \nConsequently, in FY2012, a fiscal deficit of 4.7% of GDP erased a fiscal surplus of 1.6% \nin FY2011 and the current account deficit widened to 20.6% of GDP from 10% in FY2011. While \nthe  balance  of  payments  remains  in  surplus,  the  net  rupee  balance  in  the  Royal  Monetary \nAuthority (RMA), the central bank, has been steadily declining over the past few years, standing \nat  \u2013Rs9.6  billion  ($173.6  million)  as  of  early  June  2012.  Widening  domestic  and  external \nimbalances,  coupled  with  rising  inflation  and  the  rupee  liquidity  squeeze,  pose  complex \nmacroeconomic  management  challenges  for  the  government  and  are  clear  symptoms  of \nstructural challenges in the economy that need to be addressed. \n \n13.   Government reform. Recognizing the seriousness of the issue, the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) and the RMA have  worked together to address the rupee liquidity crunch and  depleted \nrupee reserves toward improving macro-financial stability.6 The government has adopted three \ncritical  measures  to  strengthen  stewardship  of  the  economy.  First,  the  RMA  has  correctly \nclarified  that the rupee  anchors the  nominal  value  of  the  ngultrum  but  that there  should be  no \npresumption  of  unlimited  convertibility.  The  dissemination  of  this  important  fact  should  be \ncontinued.  Second,  RMA  made  it  mandatory  to  use  banking  channels  to  settle  rupee \n\n                                                \n4  The Tenth Five-Year Development Plan period covers FY2009\u2013FY2013. \n5  The nominal GDP growth rate was 17.2% in FY2007 and 18.0% in FY2012, while finance sector credit grew at 28.2% \n\nin FY2007 and 30.1% in FY2012. \n\n6  The government has established a task force to review the balance of payments with India. \n\n2  \n\n \n\n\ftransactions,  especially  for  cross  border  purchases  between  India  and  Bhutan.  This  measure \nshould have important spillovers in terms of promoting the development of the banking system, \ngreater  disclosure,  and  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  revenue  efforts.  Third,  the  RMA  has \nsought  to  improve  liquidity  management  through  the  introduction  of  the  base  and  policy  rates \nwith  the  goal  of  keeping  short-term  interest  rates  within  respective  policy  corridors  and \ncontaining growth of monetary aggregates to desired trajectories. This should be complemented \nby  a  more  robust  growth  of  macro-prudential  regulation  system  to  complement  monetary \nmanagement.7  \n \n14.   Structural considerations. The current rupee liquidity crunch was caused by structural \nand  cyclical  factors  that  reflect  weak  economic  management.  On  the  structural  side,  Bhutan \ncontinues to rely heavily on hydroelectricity exports to India supported by bilateral agreements. \nUnder  these agreements, the Government  of  India  provides  rupee financing\u201430% grants  and \n70% loans\u2014to construct hydropower plants, and the Government of Bhutan earns rupees from \nexports  of  electricity  to  India.  The  ngultrum\u2019s  peg  at  par  with  the  rupee  is  a  natural  foreign \nexchange  hedge. 8  The  large  and  lumpy  nature  of  imports  of  construction  equipment  and \nmaterials for building power plants, and the long gestation between construction and operations, \ncan  push  the  trade  balance  sharply  into  deficit.  Over  time,  as  construction  is  completed  and \nplants  go  onstream,  exports  increase,  the  trade  balance  gradually  improves,  and  export \nearnings  meet  loan  servicing  requirements.  In  the  meantime,  sizable  positive  capital  inflows \nfrom capital grants and development assistance keeps Bhutan\u2019s balance of payments in surplus.  \n \n15. \nA  more  recent  phenomenon  derives  from  rising  household  incomes.  As  most \nconsumable goods are imported from India, rapidly expanding income per capita in Bhutan has \nput further pressure on the trade deficit. Growing imports of vehicles and construction materials, \nincluding  those  for  the  housing  boom,  have  contributed  to  the  large  import  bill  from  India. \nFurther,  limited  ability  to  contain  public  spending  and  fiscal  deficits  widened  trade  deficits  and \nput  pressure  on  the  balance  of  payments  with  India.  On  the  monetary  front,  the  limited \neffectiveness of monetary and liquidity management instruments to stabilize inflation and avoid \nasset price buildup, and the limited success in effectively applying macro-prudential regulations \nto address intensifying macro-financial risks in the economy, contributed to the problem. \n \n16. \nCyclical  considerations.  On the cyclical side, there has been a combination of timing \nconsiderations  that  has  adversely  affected  the  BOP  position  in  Bhutan.  First,  from  a  debt \nmanagement  perspective,  on  the  demand  for  rupees,  loan  payments  have  spiked  with  a  few \nlumpy payments having come due in early part of the year (every 1 January in the case of Tala \nPower  Project),  which  has  led  to  further  demand  for  rupees.  In  December  2011,  when  the \nexternal imbalance with India became significantly large, the RMA and the government had to \nsell  $200  million from gross  international reserves  to  settle the  rupee  bills from India.  Second, \nfrom  a  fiscal  management  perspective,  this  heavy  dependence  on  the  timing  of  hydropower \nprojects coming on stream over the medium-term and on uncertain donor support (grants) amid \nthe  global  financial  crisis  has  increased  the  fiscal  uncertainty  and  resource  constraints.  In \naddition,  with  Bhutan  reaching  middle  income  status,  its  share  of  concessional  lending  is \nexpected  to  decline.  More  recently,  it  has  had  to  incur  in  relatively  costly  borrowing  from \ndesignated commercial financial institutions in India to provide for rupees, as required under the \nexisting  ngultrum\u2013rupee  currency  peg  arrangement.  The  cyclical  nature  of  electricity  exports \nreflecting the run-of-river hydropower plants results in a relative easing of the tight cash flow and \n                                                \n7  ADB  technical  assistance  will  support  measures  to  strengthen  liquidity  management  and  introduce  macro-\nprudential reforms. ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Supporting Financial Stability in Bhutan and the Maldives. \nManila (TA 8284-REG). \n\n8  Though  the  rupee  is  not  legal  tender  in  Bhutan,  it  was  used  widely  as  if  it  were,  as  there  were  no  regulations \n\nlimiting convertibility until recently.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fPolitical  transformation. \n\nIn  2008,  Bhutan  successfully  completed \n\nrupee  liquidity  positions during  the  second half  of the  year  as  compared to the first  half  of  the \nyear. \n \n17. \nStrategic considerations. The key challenge for Bhutan is how to maintain high, stable, \nand sustainable growth over the coming years, coinciding with the concentration of construction \nof  hydropower  projects,  while  avoiding  widening  domestic  and  external  economic  imbalances. \nBhutan's  weak  economic  management  is  attributed  primarily  to  three  factors:  (i)  the  rapid \nbuildup  in  public  spending,9 (ii) ineffective  liquidity  management,  and  (iii)  the  lack  of  savings \ninstruments  to  mobilize  higher  domestic  savings. 10  All  these  factors  caused  high  domestic \nabsorption  not  supported  by  adequate  domestic  savings,  either  public  or  private.  The \nconsequent  investment\u2013savings  gap  generated  a  high  current  account  deficit.  If  the  critical \nfactors  are  not  properly  addressed,  the  economy  may  be  headed  for  a  hard  landing  with \npotentially large economic losses reversing recent gains in socioeconomic development.  \n \n18. \nits  political \ntransformation  from  absolute  monarchy  to  constitutional  monarchy  through  a  peaceful  and \nstable process of democratization. The country\u2019s first general election for the National Assembly \nwas  held  in  March  2008.  A  new  election  is  scheduled  in  June  2013  and  a  smooth  election \nprocess is expected. \n \n19. \nADB  country  partnership  strategy.  The  Bhutan  interim  country  partnership  strategy, \n2012\u20132013  acknowledges  that  \u201cthe  tight  overall  balance  with  India  has  recently  placed  great \npressure on rupee liquidity\u201d and that \u201cthere is limited scope to sell additional reserves\u201d because \nthe  constitution  requires  foreign  exchange  reserves  to  be  maintained  to  cover  12  months  of \nessential imports (i.e., $448.9 million).11 The interim strategy also acknowledges that to maintain \na  high  and  sustainable  growth  trajectory,  more  needs  to  be  done  to  improve  economic \nmanagement including strengthening of fiscal management. Improved monetary management\u2014\nincluding measures for better foreign exchange reserves management\u2014is another priority area \nfor creating an environment conducive for high growth in a sustained manner.  \n \n20. \nLessons.  The  current  program  draws  lessons  from  past  ADB  experience  of  public \nresource management programs in South Asia12 and policy-based loans in the small economies \nsuch  as  the  Economic  Recovery  Program  in  Maldives  and  the  Financial  Sector  Development \nProgram  in  Bhutan.13 Two  important  lessons  are  that  (i)  government  commitment  is  the  most \nimportant prerequisite for a successful program; and (ii) sustained engagement with government \nofficials, including capacity development, is required to support timely program implementation. \n \n21.   Building on the strategic considerations, the program adopts a two-pronged approach to \nconfront  the  challenges  of  weak  economic  management  in  Bhutan.  First,  it  will  improve  fiscal \nmanagement to help the government allocate scarce resources more effectively and efficiently. \nMoreover,  better  debt  management  and  Treasury  operations  will  improve  cash  management, \nwhich  will  make  flow  of  funds  more  predictable  and  avoid  destabilizing  spikes  in  debt \n                                                \n9   While Bhutan largely pursued prudent fiscal policy, spending since 2010 widened fiscal deficits. \n10  Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Article  14,  Section  7  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan,  2008.  As  of  March  2012,  Bhutan\u2019s  gross \ninternational  reserves  stood  at  $769.1  million,  of  which  $196  million  was  pledged  against  the  overdraft  facility \nextended from State Bank of India, $448.9 million was set aside as reserve to cover 12 months of essential imports, \nand $120 million backed ngultrum in circulation.  \n\n12 ADB. 2007.

Second,  it  will  improve  monetary  management  to  ensure  that  interest  rate  policy \nbetter  matches  the  demand  and  supply  of  loanable  funds,  thereby  improving  liquidity \nmanagement. This will help create a stable economic environment to instill investor confidence \nand  encourage  private  investment  to  sustain  growth. 14 This  approach  will  be  reinforced  by \nstrengthening internal and external audit systems to improve the monitoring of public resources \nand  strengthen  administrative  and  financial  efficiency  and  accountability  including  at  the  sub-\nnational level of government. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe  impact  will  be  sustainably  strengthened  macro-financial  management  by  the \ngovernment. The outcome will be more effective use of the country\u2019s own financial resources in \na predictable manner. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nThe  program  is  structured  around  reform  and  policy  actions  agreed  between  ADB  and \nthe  Government  of  Bhutan  as  summarized  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4).  Four  outputs \nachieved  during  the  program  period  will  better  enable  the  government  to  address  economic \nrisks and lay the foundations of sustainable growth.  \n \n24. \nOutput 1: Improved budget and debt management systems. First, the program aims \nto  improve  allocative  efficiency  of  scarce  public  resources,  whereby,  initiatives  under  this \nprogram  component  will  include  expenditure  allocations  based  on  medium-term  expenditure \nframeworks  in  selected  municipalities.  Second,  the  program  will  also  strengthen  the  debt \nmanagement system in Bhutan to smoothen out debt servicing payments and avoid potentially \ndestabilizing  future  debt  servicing  spikes,  and  enhance  debt  management  capacity.  The \nprogram will facilitate  in developing a debt management strategy over the medium-term and a \ndebt  management  action  plan  including  the  plan  for  strengthening  the  debt  management \ndivision.  The  action  plan  will  also  address  the  issues  and  challenges  pertaining  to  (i)  narrow \ninvestor  base,  (ii)  lack  of  auction  calendar,  (iii)  promoting  price  competition  in  auctioning  of \ngovernment  securities,  and  (iv)  functional  integration  of  Treasury  Management  Division  and \nDebt Management Division for improved cash management. \n \nOutput 2: Improved revenue effort and revenue management system. The program \n25. \nwill help the government improve its revenue collection by introducing a revenue administration \nmanagement information system.  \n\n \nOutput  3:  Improved  macro-prudential  management  framework.  Improving  macro-\n26. \nprudential  management \nfor \nframework  will  be  a  key  component  under \nstrengthening  economic  management.  Policy  actions  will  be  initiated  to  (i)  improve  macro-\nprudential  framework,  (ii)  develop  the  capital  markets,  (iii)  develop  the  mutual  funds  and  fund \nmanagement  industry,  and  (iv)  develop  regulatory  and  supervisory  structure  of  the  domestic \ncredit  rating  agency.  Under  improving  macro-prudential  framework,  RMA  will  develop  policies \nand  rules  to  deal  with,  among  others  (i)  loan  to  value  ratio,  (ii)  debt  to  equity  ratio  for  project \nfinancing,  (iii)  risk  weighted  capital  requirements,  (iv)  dynamic  capital  provisioning,  and  (v) \nimprove  retail  to  wholesale  deposit  ratio.  The  RMA  will  coordinate  with  the  Royal  Securities \nExchange of Bhutan to complete a capital markets master plan.  Finally, the RMA  will take the \nsteps  necessary,  including  approving  the regulatory  system, to develop  the fund management \nindustry in Bhutan. \n\nthe  program \n\n                                                \n14 Private investment will be critical to diversifying Bhutan\u2019s exports to other sectors such as tourism and agro-based \n\nlight manufacturing.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fOutput 4: Improved external and internal audit operations. Improving audit systems \n27. \nis  a  prerequisite  to  better  economic  management.  The  Royal  Audit  Authority  will  phase  in  an \naudit  resource  management  system  over  the  program  period.  All  the  major  departments  will \ntrain staff to carry out internal audits. \n\n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nIn  the  absence  of  reform  measures\u2014with  inflation,  fiscal  deficit,  and  current  account \n28.  \ndeficit increasing and already at relatively high levels\u2014the economy may run the risk of a hard \nlanding and even recession.  \n \nD. \n \n29.   Bhutan\u2019s Vision 2020 fully committed the country to developing 10 hydropower projects \nthrough  bilateral  agreements  with  India.  As  of  the  end  of  October  2012,  three  hydropower \nprojects  namely  Chukha,  Kurichu,  and  Tala,  were  developed  and  operating.  Construction  is \nunder way for four hydropower projects: Punatsangchhu I and II, Dagachhu, and Mandechhu.15 \nThe government is also planning to embark on the construction of six new hydropower projects \nduring  FY2014.  Therefore,  the  increase  in  the  external  debt  stock  on  account  of  hydropower \nprojects alone for the period ending FY2013 is estimated at Nu16.68 billion ($313 million or 16.2% \nof  GDP)  and  is  projected  to  grow  by  Nu34.13  billion  ($609  million)  and  Nu43.62  billion  ($763 \nmillion) in FY2014 and FY2015, respectively. \n \nGiven low domestic savings and limited scope for significantly increasing public revenue, \n30. \nBhutan has a policy of allocating external concessional loans and grants on capital expenditures \nand  using  domestic  revenue  for  current  expenditure.  Any  financing  of  infrastructure  is  thus \nconstrained by the limits of external development financing assistance and, more generally, by \nthe  fiscal  and  debt  targets  under  the  medium-term  fiscal  framework.  The  fiscal  deficit  during \nFY2012\u2013FY2015  is  estimated  at  Nu9.62  billion,  the  bulk  of  it  dependent  on  external \ndevelopment financing (Table 1). The development resource gap is estimated at $158.25 million \nduring  the  same  period.16 An  average  ratio  of  capital  expenditure  to  total  expenditure  of  47% \nprojects an estimated development resource gap for capital expenditure of $74.26 million.  The \nWorld  Bank  provided  $36.00  million  in  late  2012,  and  ADB  will  finance  $35.00  million \nequivalent.17 The government will fill the unfunded gap of $3.26 million.18 \n \n\nTable 1: Overall Fiscal Deficit and Development Resource Gap \n\nFY2013 \n(budget) \n\nParticulars \nFiscal deficit (Nu million) \n\n($ million) \n(% of gross domestic product) \n\nFY2012 \n(revised) \n3,752.44   1,595.19  \n31.97 \n1.56 \n670.43  \n13.42 \n($ million) \nNote: Revised estimates and projections are as of 31 March 2012.  \na The unfunded gap attributed to capital expenditure. \nSource: Government of Bhutan.

It  indicates  the  additional  resources  required  beyond  expected  new \nborrowings.  \n\n17 On  a  parallel  basis,  ADB  is  advising  the  Government  of  Bhutan  on  raising  rupee  resources  through  market \nborrowings. Options include (i) an offshore sovereign rupee bond issue with a partial credit guarantee from ADB, \n(ii)  an  offshore  rupee  bond  issue  by  state-owned  enterprises  with  a  partial  credit  guarantee  from  ADB,  which  is \ncovered  by  the  sovereign  counter  guarantee,  and  (iii)  a  rupee  or  dollar  syndication  loan  with  a  partial  credit \nguarantee from ADB. \n\n18  Fiscal Projections (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6  \n\n \n\n\fProgram Implementation Arrangements \n\nThe government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR9,224,000 \n31. \n($14.19 million) and a grant not exceeding $20.81 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nto  help finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a grace  period  of  8 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing agreement.  \n \n32. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  World  Bank,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF), \nand  ADB  are  the  key  development  partners  supporting  the  government\u2019s  undertaking  public \nmanagement  reforms.  World  Bank  support  under  its  Second  Development  Policy  Credit \nProgram  will  strengthen  rules  and  regulations  including  audit  and  accounting  standards,  the \nAnti-corruption  Act  2006,  rules  on  occupational  health,  the  Road  Act  2004,  and  a  disaster \nmanagement  bill.19   The  IMF  does  not  have  a  program  in  Bhutan  but  will  field  its  Article  IV \nreview mission in late 2013, as Bhutan is on a 24-month cycle and had Article IV consultation in \n2011.20 Discussions have been held with both the IMF and the World Bank on the program, and \ncoordination has been very effective.21  \n \nE. \n \n33.  Management, tranches, and review. The Department of Public Accounts (DPA) in the \nMOF will be the executing agency and will oversee and coordinate the timely implementation of \nagreed policy actions. The implementing agencies will be the DPA, Department of Revenue and \nCustoms, Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, Royal Audit Authority, and RMA. Each will \nbe responsible for undertaking the policy actions or program activities under its responsibilities \ndescribed  in  the  policy  matrix.  Ongoing  technical  assistance  will  help  the  government  fulfill \nprogram  conditions  (footnote  23).  The  DPA  will  be  responsible  for  program  administration, \ndisbursements, and maintaining all program records. A program steering committee will be set \nup  and  chaired  by  the  secretary  and/or  joint  secretary  of  the  MOF.  The  committee  will  have \nrepresentatives  of  other  departments  and  authorities  concerned,  including  the  Department  of \nRevenue  and  Customs,  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human  Settlement,  Royal  Audit  Authority,  and \nRMA. The committee will meet once in every quarter and monitor the progress of the program. \nThe  loan  of  SDR9,224,000  and  grant  of  $20.81  million  will  be  provided  in  two  tranches  and \ndisbursed upon satisfaction of loan and grant effectiveness conditions\u2014that is, fulfillment of all \nactions in the program policy matrix. The first tranche will be the grant and the second tranche \nthe  loan.  The  first  tranche  is  expected  to  be  disbursed  in  March  2013.  The  government  shall \nundertake  periodic  reviews  during  implementation  to  evaluate  program  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  progress,  and  achievement  of  objectives.  In  addition  to  periodic  reviews,  a \nmidterm review will take place during the fourth quarter of 2013. \n \n34. \nProcurement,  disbursement,  and  counterpart funds. Loan and grant proceeds will be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements for  policy-based loans and grants.22 ADB  will  have the  right to  audit the  use of the \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. Local currency generated \nfrom  the  loan  and  grant  will  be  deposited  into  the  government\u2019s  budget  fund  account  with  the \nBank of Bhutan toward providing supplementary financing for the 2013 budget. \n \nPolicy actions and dialogue. The government will ensure that all policies adopted and \n35. \nactions taken under the program, as set forth in the development policy letter (Appendix 3) and \nthe policy matrix (Appendix 4), continue to be in effect for the duration of the program. \n                                                \n19  World Bank. 2012.

The  DPA  will  establish  a \n36. \nperformance  evaluation  system  for  the  program  within  3  months  from  grant  and  loan \neffectiveness and maintain it. Using this system, the DPA will monitor the program and report to \nADB on the implementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with \nthe program impact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the government. \n  \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nAlthough the proposed program does not have a piggybacked technical assistance (TA), \n\n \n37. \nit will be supported by five TAs.23   \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\nEconomic  \n\n \nA. \n \n38. \nSeveral  outputs  of  the  program  have  technical  components  at  their  core.  The \nintroduction of revenue administration and property valuation systems is expected to strengthen \ntax  administration  and  improve  compliance.  The  rollout  of  an  audit  information  management \nsystem  is  expected  to  improve  external  and  internal  audit  operations  and  compliance  of \ngovernance.  \n \nB. \n \n39. \n Despite  the  current  rupee  liquidity  crunch,  the  government  projects  that  the  economy \nwill grow at an average of 9.8% during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2013\u20132018 and about 15% \nby  FY2020, the  year stipulated  in  Vision  2020. The  hydropower  sector will  be  the main driver, \ncontributing  56%  of growth.  To finance  projected economic growth,  external  debt service as a \npercentage of GDP is estimated at 6.81% in FY2014 and 3.92% in FY2015.24  \n \nThe current account deficit with India is projected to reach 15.9% of GDP in FY2013 and \n40. \nto  have  increased  to  28.4%  by  FY2015,  mainly  reflecting  expanded  imports  to  construct \nhydropower  projects.  To  manage  the  anticipated  rupee  shortage,  the  RMA  has  introduced  a \nnew policy that requires demand for rupees to be justified to better manage the rupee liquidity \nposition and is accessing the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation currency swap \nfacility launched in May  2012.25 In addition, the Government of India has recently increased to \nRs10 billion its line of credit to the Government of Bhutan for addressing the rupee shortfall. \n \nThough  the  aggregate  current  account  is  projected  to  be  in  deficit  equal  to  23.2%  of \n41. \nGDP in FY2013 and is expected to deteriorate further to 34.6% of GDP in FY2015, the overall \nbalance of payment is projected to be in surplus equal to 2.8% of GDP in FY2013 and improve \n\n                                                \n23 Implementation  of  the  program  will  be  complemented  by  ADB\u2019s  (i)  two  ongoing  capacity  development  technical \nassistance  namely  (a)  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Strengthening  Public \nManagement.  Manila  (TA  7724-BHU)  and  (b)  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for \nStrengthening Audit Resource Management. Manila (TA 7723-BHU); and (ii) three recently approved TAs namely, \n(a) ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Capital Market Development. Manila (TA 8280-\nBHU), (b) ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Supporting Financial Stability in Bhutan and the Maldives. Manila \n(TA 8284-REG), and (c) ADB. 2012.  Strengthening Royal Monetary Authority's Regulatory Capacity for Nonbank \nFinancial Institutions. Manila (TA 8076-BHU). All will reinforce good practices in revenue and audit in line with the \nneeds of a maturing and more complex economy.   \n\n24  The  IMF  considers  the  debt  to  be  sustainable  as  it  is  predominantly  for  building  hydropower  projects  through \n\nproject finance with high financial rates of return. \n\n25 The$2.0  billion  facility  was  set  up  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  in  May  2012  and  is  available  in  both  foreign \ncurrency and Indian rupees against the domestic currency of member central banks including the  RMA. It is short \nterm in nature and targets sudden shortfalls caused by capital outflows resulting from shocks. \n\n8  \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nto 6.2% in FY2015, mainly from inflows of external grants and concessional loans. The country\u2019s \ntotal  reserves  are  projected  to  grow  from  $806  million  in  FY2013  to  $1.1  billion  by  FY2015, \nenabling  Bhutan  to  comply  with  the  constitutional  requirement  of  covering  12  months  of \nessential merchandise imports or the guided minimum reserve requirement of $500 million.26  \n \nThe current account deficit, rupee liquidity crunch, and credit and fiscal expansions are \n42.  \nplacing upward pressure on inflation, forecasted by ADB to reach 10.1% in FY2013 and 10.5% \nin  FY2014.  Accordingly,  ADB  has  recently  revised  its  GDP  growth  forecast  for  Bhutan  down \nslightly from 8.0% to 7.9% in FY2013 and from 8.5% to 8.4% in FY2014. However, the general \nconsensus is that the rupee liquidity crunch will subside over the longer term once hydropower \nplants are fully built and generating export revenue. \n \nC. \n \n43. \nProgram preparation included a governance risk assessment conducted along the lines \nprescribed  by  the  implementation  guidelines  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption \nAction  Plan.27 This  assessment  was  complemented  by  a  review  of  areas  of  possible  risk  and \nvulnerability in state financial management. The assessment found some vulnerability that could \naffect the proposed program related to (i) political support for the Government of Bhutan and its \nownership  of  the  program  and  (ii)  such  institutional  dimensions  as  weak  capacity.  Despite \ncapacity constraints, public resources are managed reasonably well in Bhutan. Some areas that \nrequire  rectification  are  (i)  inadequate  cash  management  including  revenue  projections, \n(ii) weak  debt  management  capacity  including  institutional  arrangements,  and  (iii)  weak  audit \nsystems  and  procedures.  While  no  major  risk  of  resource  mismanagement  at  the  executing \nlevel can be discerned, issues raised in the assessments are addressed in the program. \n \nD. \n \n44. \nBhutan\u2019s  economy  performed  well  during  FY2001\u20132011,  achieving  an  average  8% \neconomic  growth  rate.  As  a  result,  the  country  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  reducing \npoverty  incidence,  which declined from  32%  in 2003 to  23%  in 2007.  However,  if  the  ongoing \nIndian  rupee  liquidity  issue  persists,  it  can  cause  a  hard  landing,  and  have  a  direct  impact  on \npoverty.  The  program  will  help  the  government  avoid  the  risks  of  a  contraction  or  significant \nslowdown  in  GDP  growth  and  make  further  progress  in  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  the \nMillennium Development Goals.28 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n45. \nThe  program\u2019s  primary  aim  is  to  improve  government  economic  management  through \nbudget  support.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n26 Essential imports are loosely defined to include (i) food, household, and medical items; (ii) raw materials; and (iii) \n\nreplacement and spares for capital equipment.  \n\n27 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  the  implementation  of  the  program  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy. \n\n28 For Millennium Development Goals for Bhutan, please refer to Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness \nCommission. 2011.
