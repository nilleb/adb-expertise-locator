The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Capacity Building of Tamil \nNadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO), and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  project  will  strengthen  power  transmission  connectivity  between  the \nsouthern part of the Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor (CKIC) and the northern part of the \nCKIC  by  augmenting  the  765  kilovolt  (kV)  and  400  kV  networks.  This  will  allow  more  power \nincluding renewable energy to be evacuated from new generation facilities in the south CKIC to \nthe  energy  hungry  north  CKIC.  The  project  will  also  enhance  the  institutional  capacity  of \nTANTRANSCO  by  (i)  supporting  the  implementation  of  a  financial  restructuring  plan  (FRP)  to \nrestore the financial sustainability of TANTRANSCO; (ii) facilitating the introduction of gender \nsensitive  workplace  practices;  and  (iii)  building  TANTRANSCO\u2019s  capacity  to  monitor  the \nenvironmental and social impacts of power transmission projects. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nGovernment development policies. In 2018, Tamil Nadu had the second largest economy \namong Indian states with a gross domestic product of $250 billion. Industry accounts for a relatively \nhigh share of the state economy of 34%, compared with 26% for the national economy. Services \naccount for 53% of the state economy, dominated by information technology; exports of services \nfrom the state totaled $15 billion in 2018. The agriculture sector accounted for 13% of the state \neconomy. State gross domestic product growth averaged 7% annually over 2014\u20132018.1 \n \n4. \nThe Government of Tamil Nadu has identified availability of quality infrastructure including \na reliable power supply, as a key prerequisite for further economic development of the state. The \nstate  government  is  also  committed  to  developing  industrial  corridors  to  link  industrial  and \ncommercial  hubs  such  as  Chennai  and  Coimbatore  with  less  developed  rural  areas  to  promote \nbalanced development and poverty alleviation in rural areas. In this context, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has been assisting the state government in developing the CKIC as a key component \nof the state\u2019s economic development strategy. The CKIC covers 23 of the state\u2019s 32 districts and \n70% of the state population.2 \n \n5. \nThe  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  is  prioritizing  the  Chennai\u2013Tiruchirappalli  area  in  the \nnorthern part of CKIC for development of the manufacturing industry, while targeting the Madurai\u2013\nThoothukudi  area  in  the  southern  part  of  the  CKIC  for  development  of renewable  energy-based \npower generation because of the availability of wind and solar resources. Although Tamil Nadu has \na relatively low incidence of poverty compared with the rest of the country, scarce water resources \nand arid conditions contribute to relatively high incidences of poverty in the southernmost districts \n\n1  PRS Legislative Research. Tamil Nadu Budget Analysis 2019\u20132020. (accessed 19 February 2019). \n2  ADB. 2019. Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor Comprehensive Development Plan Main Report. Manila. \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nof  the  CKIC. 3  Development  of  renewable  energy  in  the  relatively  poor  southern  districts  will \ncontribute to poverty alleviation, economic development, and employment creation.  \n\n6. \nState government energy sector strategy. Tamil Nadu, which accounts for nearly 9% of \ntotal electricity sales in India, is the third largest electricity consuming state in the country. As of \nMarch 2019, Tamil Nadu had installed generation capacity of 30,024 megawatts (MW), including \n8,367  MW  of  wind  power  capacity  and  2,444  MW  of  solar  power  capacity.  Tamil  Nadu  has  the \nhighest installed renewable energy capacity among Indian states\u2014renewable energy contributed \nto 23% of the state\u2019s total generation requirement as of March 2019.4 \n \n7. \nTamil  Nadu  has  achieved  100%  household  electrification.  Per-capita  electricity \nconsumption  in  the  state  was  about  1,372 kilowatts  (kW)  in fiscal  year  (FY)  2019,  higher  than \nIndia\u2019s national average of 1,075 kW, mainly driven by high electricity usage by industries. It is \nexpected that industry and commercial enterprises will account for most of the future growth in \nelectricity  demand.  Because  of  its  success  in  developing  its  rich  renewable  energy  resources. \nTamil Nadu has become an energy-surplus state. The state government is keen to position Tamil \nNadu as an exporter of electricity through the interstate transmission network to meet other states\u2019 \ndemand for power. \n \n8. \nIt  is  expected  that  peak  demand  for  electricity  in  Tamil  Nadu  will  reach  25,000 MW  by \n2025, from 15,487 MW as of March 2019. The state government\u2019s Vision Tamil Nadu document \nenvisages  generation  capacity  reaching  50,000  MW  by  2025,  up  from  30,024  MW  as  of  March \n2019.5 This will involve adding 10,000 MW of wind and solar power capacity during 2019\u20132025. It \nis expected that Tamil Nadu will make a significant contribution to helping India achieve the national \ntarget of adding 175,000 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 under India\u2019s commitment to \nthe  United  Nations  Framework  for  Climate  Change.  The  state  government  has  identified \nstrengthening the power transmission grid with adequate redundancy (spare capacity) as being vital \nto integrating large-scale renewable capacity with the power grid. \n \nThe state government unbundled the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB)6 in 2010 to form \n9. \ntwo  separate  state-owned  companies:  (i)  Tamil  Nadu  Generation  and  Distribution  Corporation \nLimited  (TANGEDCO),  responsible  for  generation  and  distribution;  and  (ii)  TANTRANSCO, \nresponsible for transmission. The main objective of the unbundling was to enhance the commercial \norientation  of  power  utilities  and  improve  their  corporate  governance.  As  the  sole  transmission \nlicensee of the state, TANTRANSCO owns and operates the transmission network at voltages in \nthe range of 110 kV\u2013765 kV. \n \n10. \nThe  state  government  established  the  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission \n(TNERC)  in  1999  to  facilitate  tariff-setting  on  sound  economic  principles.  However,  the  state \ngovernment has continued to set the tariffs for several consumer segments (farmers and poor \nhouseholds) below cost-recovery levels on socioeconomic grounds, contributing the difference to \n\n \n\n3  The percentage of people living below the poverty line in India is 21.9% (2012), while for Tamil Nadu the figure is \n11.9% (2012). However, in terms of highest poverty incidence, the southern district of Ramanthanpuram is ranked \n9th (with rural poverty incidence of 17.8% in 2012) out of 32 districts in Tamil Nadu.  (Government of Tamil Nadu, \nState Planning Commission. 2017. Tamil Nadu Human Development Report. Tamil Nadu.)   \n\n4  Government of Tamil Nadu, Energy Department. Policy Note 2018-19. \n5  Government of Tamil Nadu. 2014. Vision Tamil Nadu: Strategic Plan for Infrastructure Development in Tamil Nadu. \n\nChennai. \n\n6  TNEB remains as the holding company of TANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO.  \n \n\n\fTANGEDCO as a revenue subsidy. However, these revenue subsidies have not been sufficient \nto meet the gap between the approved tariff for subsidized consumers and the cost of supply. \n \n11. \nThe  state  government  absorbed  TANGEDCO\u2019s  liabilities  of  \u20b9230  billion  ($3.5  billion)  in \n2017 as part of the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme promoted by the central \ngovernment.7 TANGEDCO has committed to improving its commercial and financial performance \nin return for debt relief provided by the state government, and has committed to eliminating the \ngap between  cost of supply  and aggregate revenues realized (including for approved revenue \nsubsidies). However, progress to date has not been satisfactory mainly because of delays in filing \nfor annual tariff revisions by TANGEDCO. The state government has assured that submissions \nwould be made for tariff revisions to TNERC on annual basis starting FY2021. \n \nTransmission  constraints  to  be  addressed.  The  districts  in  the  southern  CKIC  are \n12. \nexpected  to  contribute  9,000  MW  of  added  generation  capacity  during  FY2019\u20132025.  This \nincludes 6,000 MW of renewable energy capacity, of which 2,060 MW are under construction as \nof  March  2019.  The  existing  transmission  network  capacity  is  inadequate  to  reliably  evacuate \npower from these new renewable-energy-based plants in the southern CKIC. \n \n13. \nAs the demand for electricity and supply of renewable energy increase, the frequency and \nduration of curtailment of renewable-energy-based plants are likely to increase in the absence of \na strengthened transmission network. This may deter further development of renewable energy \nin the region. This may also result in suboptimal operation of the power system (i.e., continuing \nto operate more expensive thermal power plants while curtailing the use of cheaper renewable \nenergy sources). Therefore, in the absence of a strengthened transmission network, the economic \ncost of supplying electricity would increase, and greenhouse gas emissions would rise. \n \n14. \nThe  project  will  establish  an  extra-high-voltage  (765  kV)  transmission  link  between \nVirudhunagar and Coimbatore to transfer the expected added generation capacity of 9,000 MW \nby 2025 in the southern CKIC to Coimbatore, which is a major industrial center. The project also \nincludes the construction of a 400 kV/230 kV pooling substation at Ottapidaram and associated \n400  kV  transmission  lines  to  pool  power  generated  at  renewable  and  thermal  power  plants  in \nThoothukudi  District  in  the  southern  CKIC  and  transmit  that  power  to  the  765  kV/400  kV \nVirudhunagar substation. TANTRANSCO considered several alternative network configurations \nto meet the expected demand for transmission capacity and verified through engineering studies \nthat the proposed solution is the optimum design configuration. \n \n15. \nRestoring  the  financial  sustainability  of  Tamil  Nadu  Transmission  Corporation \nLimited. The project also seeks to restore the financial viability of TANTRANSCO by addressing \nlegacy issues emanating from the allocation of liabilities and accumulated losses of the TNEB to \nits  successor  entities  (TANTRANSCO  and  TANGEDCO)  during  the  unbundling  process. \nTANTRANSCO  has  been  allocated  a  disproportionate  share  of  liabilities  of  TNEB  that  were \naccrued for financing cash-flow deficits and recurrent losses before 2010. \n \n16. \nThese loans have no corresponding transmission assets, hence, TNERC has not allowed \nTANTRANSCO  to  recover  debt  service  cost  of  these  loans  through  transmission  tariffs. \nTANTRANSCO has been compelled to borrow from commercial sources to bridge the resultant \ncash-flow deficit. Consequently, TANTRANSCO has fallen into a debt trap whereby it is compelled \n\n7  Ujwal  DISCOM  Assurance  Yojana  is  the  financial  turnaround  and  revival  package  for  electricity  distribution \ncompanies  (DISCOMs)  initiated  by  the  Government  of  India  to  find  a  permanent  solution  to  improving  the  weak \nfinancial status of DISCOMs.  \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nloans \n\nto keep borrowing more money to service its debt yet lacks additional revenue sources to recoup \nits debt-service obligations. \n \n17. \nAnother issue is that TANTRANSCO has not been able to contribute 30% of  its capital \nexpenditures as equity (30% is the expected equity contribution in transmission tariff methodology \nadopted  by  TNERC).  Therefore,  the  depreciation  provision  allowed  in  transmission  tariff  by \nTNERC  is  not  adequate  to  meet  the  debt  service  payments.  As  of  31  March  2019,  the  total \nunsustainable  liabilities  (to  external  creditors)  that  TANTRANSCO  cannot  service  through \ntransmission tariffs was estimated to be \u20b957.3 billion ($806 million). \n \n18. \nDuring project preparation, ADB assisted the government of Tamil Nadu in preparing a \nfinancial  restructuring  plan  (FRP)  to  address  this  long-standing  issue  and  restore  the  financial \nviability of TANTRANSCO. The project administration manual (PAM) describes the FRP and the \ndraft loan agreement reflects key aspects of FRP as covenants.8 \n \n19. \nThe FRP consists of the following key features: (i) an equity injection from the government \nof Tamil Nadu over 3 years starting from FY2021 to settle the unsustainable liabilities owed to \nexternal creditors; (ii) adjusting intercompany liabilities owed to TANGEDCO; (iii) extending the \nrepayment  period  of  TANTRANSCO\u2019s  remaining \nto  12  years;  (iv)  rationalizing \nTANTRANSCO\u2019s  future  annual  capital  expenditures  to  ensure  30%  of  capital  expenditure  is \nfinanced with equity and internal cash generation; and (v) filing petitions for annual transmission \ntariff revisions with the TNERC. \n \n20. \nImplementation of the FRP will enable TANTRANSCO to reach financial viability by 2024. \nIn addition to supporting the FRP, the financial management action plan (FMAP) described in the \nPAM recommends several measures to improve corporate governance. The attached technical \nassistance  (TA)  will  support  these  measures.9 Implementation  of  the  FRP  and  the  FMAP  will \nensure that TANTRANSCO will become financially viable and will be able to finance its capital \nexpenditures  beyond  2024  using  commercial  sources  and  internal  cash  generation,  without \nrequiring government equity support. \n \nAlignment  with  Strategy  2030.  The  project  is  closely  aligned  with  the  operational \n21. \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to (i) tackle climate change and promote renewable energy by \nimproving transmission connectivity from the renewable-resource-rich southwest region of Tamil \nNadu  to  load  centers  in  Chennai  and  Coimbatore;  (ii)  strengthen  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity through implementation of the FRP and the FMAP; and (iii) promote gender-sensitive \nworkplace practices and enhanced career opportunities for female staff.10 \n \n22. \nADB  value  addition.  Because  of  legacy  issues  related  to  the  establishment  of \nTANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO, both companies are saddled with unsustainable levels of debt. \nThe government of Tamil Nadu has shown a keen interest to collaborate with ADB to resolve this \nissue.  ADB  has  engaged  in  high-level  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  to \nrestore the financial viability of TANTRANSCO in a fiscally sustainable manner.

ADB  has  financed  765  kV  transmission  lines  and  substations \nimplemented  by  the  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India. 11  The  project  incorporates  ADB\u2019s \nexperience  and  lessons  learned  through  those  projects  with  respect  to  technical  design, \ncontract  management,  and  safeguard  issues  including  accurately  aligning  transmission  line \nroutes at the outset to minimize safeguard-related issues during project implementation. ADB \nwill  use  satellite  technology  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of  the  transmission  line  alignment  and \nminimize environmental and social impacts. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  industrial  development  and  renewable \n24. \nenergy  utilization  in  Tamil  Nadu  enhanced  (footnote  5).  The  project  will  have  the  following \noutcome: power supply in the CKIC increased in a financially sustainable manner.  \n \nC. \n \n25. \nOutput 1: Transmission link from southern Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor \nto  load  centers  in  northern  Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari  Industrial  Corridor  established.  This \noutput  will  establish  a  765  kV  substation  in  Virudhunagar  and  765  kV  power  transmission  link \nbetween the power generation hub in the Madurai\u2013Thoothukudi area (southern part of the CKIC) \nand load centers in the northern parts of the CKIC. \n \nOutput  2:  Pooling  substation  established  in  Thoothukudi  District.  This  output  will \n26. \nestablish  a  400  kV  pooling  substation  and  associated  transmission  lines  to  receive  electricity \ngenerated from power plants in the Thoothukudi district.  \n \n27. \nOutput 3: Financial and institutional capacity of Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation \nLimited improved. This output will (i) assist TANTRANSCO in implementing the FRP to restore \nits financial sustainability; (ii) support the implementation of the financial management action plan \n(FMAP)  to  improve  the  financial  management  capacity  and  corporate  governance  of \nTANTRANSCO;  (iii)  facilitate  the  introduction  of  gender-sensitive  workplace  practices  within \nTANTRANSCO; and (iv) enhance the capacity of TANTRANSCO to monitor the environmental \nand  social  impacts  of  transmission  projects.

ADB will finance 100% of mitigation costs and 100% of adaptation costs.13 \nThe climate mitigation finance was estimated based on the share of renewable energy transmitted \nby the project financed transmission assets. The climate adaptation cost is estimated based on \nthe incremental cost of transmission lines to withstand higher wind speeds (wind zone 4).  \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe government of Tamil Nadu will execute the project, acting through TANTRANSCO, \nthe  state-owned  transmission  utility.  As  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency, \nTANTRANSCO will have overall responsibility for executing the investment project and for its day-\nto-day  implementation.  The  Government  of  India  will  channel  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  the \ngovernment  of  Tamil  Nadu,  which  will  then  on-lend  those  funds  to  TANTRANSCO.  The \ngovernment  of  Tamil  Nadu  is  also  expected  to  make  counterpart  funds  available  to \nTANTRANSCO  as  equity  investments  to  augment  TANTRANSCO\u2019s  capital  base.

At  the  government\u2019s \nrequest, TANTRANSCO will be the executing agency and implementing agency for the TA. The TA \nwill be implemented over 24 months from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2021 (footnote 9).  \n \n34. \nThe TA will (i) support implementation of the FRP and the FMAP by providing financial \nanalysis expertise to TANTRANSCO, and supporting the preparation of a gap analysis of existing \naccounting  practices  and  the  requirements  for  adoption  of  Indian  Accounting  Standards;  (ii) \nsupport  TANTRANSCO  to  undertake  a  needs  assessment  to  identify  interventions  to  make \nTANTRANSCO a more gender-sensitive workplace, and support implementation and monitoring \nof  some  of  these  measures;  and  (iii)  enhance  the  capacity  of  TANTRANSCO  to  monitor  the \nsafeguard aspects of transmission investment projects, including investments under the project. \n \n35. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $650,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  TANTRANSCO  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \nADB  staff  undertook  due  diligence  of  the  project  to  establish  the  need  for  proposed \n36. \ntransmission  network  strengthening  in  the  context  of  expected  additions  of  new  generation \ncapacity  in  the  southern  CKIC  and  the  anticipated  demand  increase  in  the  northern  CKIC. \nTANTRANSCO  Planning  Department  undertook  power  system  studies  to  assess  different \nnetwork  configurations  and  identify  the  least-cost  option  of  providing  transmission  connectivity \nbetween the southern and northern CKIC. The Central Electricity Authority of India has reviewed \nand approved the technical substation designs, including the addition of shunt reactors to maintain \nvoltages at desired levels during low-load periods. \n \nB. \n \nThe transmission pricing regime (the aggregate revenue requirement approach) in India \n37. \nand in Tamil Nadu is based on the cost-plus principle which means that tariffs are based on all \neligible costs of the transmission utility plus a reasonable return on portion of equity financing of \ncapital investments. As TNERC has approved the project as an eligible capital investment project, \nits financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is guaranteed under the prevailing regulatory regime. \nThe  FIRR  does  not  depend  on  utilization  levels  (i.e.  actual  power  flow  of  transmission  assets \nfunded under the project or an approved capital cost increase by the regulator). On this basis, the \nestimated  FIRR  of  the  project  is  3.3%,  compared  with  the  project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital of 2.98%. ADB staff performed an analysis to assess the sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse \nchanges  in  key  variables,  including  (i)  capital  cost  increase  not  allowed  by  the  regulator;  (ii) \nincrease in operation and maintenance costs; and (iii) delay in project completion. The results of \n\n\fGovernance \n\nthe sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project\u2019s financial viability is robust under likely adverse \nscenarios.14 \n \n38. \n ADB  staff  conducted  the  economic  analysis  of  the  project  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines. The analysis evaluated the costs and benefits in FY2019 constant prices for a period \nof 29 years starting from FY2019 until FY2047. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was \ncalculated  by  comparing  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  project  is \neconomically  viable  with  an  EIRR  of  13.47%,  and  the  project\u2019s  expected  net  present  value  is \n$2.38  billion  at  an  economic  discount  rate  of  9%  per  year.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  was \nassessed with respect to the scenarios considered for the FIRR, plus a reduction in renewable \nand  thermal  generation  capacity.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  are  described  in  the \neconomic  analysis  and  confirmed  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is  robust  under  likely \nadverse scenarios.15 \n \nC. \n \nThe financial management risk is substantial mainly because of corporate governance \n39. \nissues  with  respect  to  the  project  executing  agency  (TANTRANSCO).  These  relate  to  (i) \nconcerns about its financial viability (paras. 15\u201317); (ii) the absence of independent directors; \nand (iii) the absence of an internal auditor. The FRP to be implemented by the end of FY2024 \nwill restore the financial viability of TANTRANSCO. The government and TANTRANSCO have \nagreed to appoint an internal auditor by the end of FY2020 to improve corporate governance. \n \n40. \nTANTRANSCO  operates  under  a  robust  legislative  framework  and  is  subject  to  annual \naudits  by  the  comptroller  and  auditor  general  of  Tamil  Nadu.  Its  operations  and  tariffs  are \nregulated by TNERC, and it has experience with the disbursement and procurement processes \nand  procedures  of  international  development  agencies  such  as  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW.  However,  ADB \nassessed the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of TANTRANSCO as substantial \nbecause of low levels of computerization and automation in accounting and financial  reporting, \nsubstantial  unreconciled  interunit  and  intercompany  balances,  the  lack  of  a  completed  fixed \nassets registry, and a weak internal audit system. \n \n41. \n ADB  and  TANTRANSCO  have  agreed  upon  a  time  bound  FMAP,  as  described  in  the \nPAM  and  the  financial  management  assessment. 16  The  FMAP  will  mitigate  the  financial \nmanagement  risk.    ADB  has  prepared  a  separate  project  financial  management  manual  to \nimprove the financial management of proceeds of ADB loan funds. \n \n42.  TANTRANSCO  has  well  developed  procurement  systems  which  comply  with  its  own \nprocurement policy as well as the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998, the Tamil Nadu \nTransparency in Tenders Rules, 2000, and the Government of India\u2019s General Financial Rules, \n2005. It has experienced professionals in its Transmission (Electrical) and Transmission (Civil) \nDepartments who have extensive experience in delivering projects of similar size and complexity \nusing Open Competitive Bidding (OCB). The existing procurement processes are governed by \nregulations that require robust documentation which are archived and easily accessed and has \nthe capability to provide data to support contract negotiations, dispute resolutions, and required \n\n \n\n14 The results of the sensitivity analysis are in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\naudits.  The  existing  procurement  processes  and systems  in  place  are  considered  adequate  to \nsatisfy  any  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  requirements  with  only  minor  adjustments.    The \nprocurement  activities  under  the  project  have  been  substantially  completed  and  the  overall \nprocurement risk is assessed to be \u201cmoderate\u2019.  \n \n43. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended  from time to time) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  TANTRANSCO.  ADB  undertook  integrity  due  diligence  and \nthere were no adverse findings. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed  in  the  PAM.  TANTRANSCO  will  consult  ADB\u2019s  Standard  Bidding  Document  for  the \nProcurement of Plant\u2014Design, Supply, and Installation to ensure value-for-money in procurement. \n \nD. \n \n44. \nThe project will contribute to the overall economic development of the state by ensuring a \nmore  reliable,  more  competitive  power  supply  for  industry  and  services.  This  will  in  turn  spur \ninclusive economic growth by generating employment and improving livelihoods. The project will \npromote renewable energy development in an underdeveloped region of the state. \n \n45. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements.  It  presents  limited \nopportunities  for  gender  mainstreaming  because  of  the  nature  of  the  project.  However,  gender-\nfocused discussions undertaken at TANTRANSCO indicate that scope exists to introduce gender-\nfriendly  working  conditions  and  practices  at  the  utility,  particularly  in  its  field  offices.  These  may \ninclude  but  not  be  limited  to  workplace  facilities  that  respond  to  gender-based  needs,  including \nseparate and convenient lavatories, resting rooms, and recreation and medical facilities for women. \n \nE. \n \n46. \ncategories are as follows.17 \n \n47. \nEnvironment (category B). The project is categorized as environmental category B as \nthe  project  will  not  pass  through  any  environmentally  or  ecologically  sensitive  area.  Following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  TANTRANSCO  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE),  including  an  environmental management  plan  to minimize  adverse  impacts \nduring project construction and operation. The technical design ensures that the electromagnetic \nfields  are  within  safe  limits  at  the  ground  level.  There  are  no  associated  facilities  as  per  the \ndefinition of associated facilities in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Induced impacts because \nof  power  generation  capacity  additions  in  the  project  impact  areas  are  described  in  the  IEE. \nTANTRANSCO has undertaken meaningful consultations with communities in the project impact \nareas.  The  IEE  has  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Although  TANTRANSCO  has  the \ninstitutional  capacity  and  experience  to  manage  environmental  risks  through  its  General \nConstruction Circle (GCC) Madurai, ADB will provide additional capacity building support through \nthe  attached  TA.  If  unanticipated  environmental  and  resettlement  impacts  occur  during \nimplementation,  TANTRANSCO  will  prepare  a corrective  action  plan  or update the IEE  and/or \nenvironment  management  plan  to  address  and  mitigate  the  issues.  The  GCC  will  supervise, \nmonitor, audit, and report to ADB through semiannual environmental monitoring reports. \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n17  ADB. 2009.

TANTRANSCO  has  carefully  designed  the \n48. \nsubstations and transmission line alignments to avoid all structures and minimize land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement. The substations will be built on land owned by TANTRANSCO and \nwill not involve land acquisition. The 522 kilometres of project transmission lines will have mostly \ntemporary  impacts  but  will  also  have  permanent  impacts  on  trees  and  tower  footprints.  No \nhouseholds  will  be  physically  displaced  or  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  (income-\ngenerating) assets. TANTRANSCO has prepared a resettlement plan in compliance with Indian \nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. \nMitigation  measures  and  budgetary  provisions  are  in  place  to  provide  compensation  at \nreplacement cost, commensurate to the impacts, and to restore livelihoods. TANTRANSCO will \nmonitor implementation of the resettlement plan and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n49. \npopulations therefore, the project will not impact indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n \n50. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
