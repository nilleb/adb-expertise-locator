Lax  supervision  and \ninsufficient\naccountability  have  distorted  performance  incentives  for  supervisors  and\nstaff. Inadequate enforcement of commercial laws and regulations, market\nprotection,  and  administered  prices  have  contributed  to  ineffective  SOE\nmanagement.\n\nThough established to serve both economic and social goals, SOEs have\nbeen  inefficient  suppliers  of  both  public  and  private  goods  and  services.\nThe provision of social services and contribution to regional development\nobjectives  has  largely  been  achieved  at  a considerable  cost  to  society.\nInefficiencies arose because of indiscriminate subsidization and protection\nof SOEs without due regard  for  economic  rationale  and  competitiveness.\nMoreover,  there  has  been  a  high  degree  of  exploitation  of  SOEs  for  the\nbenefit  of  individuals  and  their  associated  interests,  accompanied  by\ngrowing corruption and collusion or outright fraud. This weak governance\nin  the  Government\u2019s  sphere  of  influence  encouraged  violations  of  rules\nand  regulations  in  the  private  sector,  to  the  detriment  of  creditors  and\nminority shareholders.\n\nSOEs\u2019  reliance  on  two-step  foreign  currency  loans  that  they  received  in\nlocal currency has significant long-term budgetary implications. Under the\nstandard  on-lending  arrangements,  the  Government  carries  the  full\nexchange rate risk on both interest and principal for SOEs\u2019 borrowings. In\naddition,  substantial  amounts  of  capital  injections  and  debt  foregiveness\nhave  diverted  resources  from  addressing  social  development  priorities.\nOverall,  the  costs  of  holding  onto  the  portfolio  of  SOEs  are  significant.\nBesides opportunity cost of capital, the past practice of two-step loans will\nburden  the  state  budget  with  at  least  $1.1  billion  (Rp11  trillion)  per  year\nduring the next decade. The direct costs of nonperforming loans from the\nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF)  to  individual  SOEs  is  estimated  to  amount  to\n$300 million (Rp3 trillion) annually. This amounts to a total of about $3.9\nbillion (Rp39 trillion) of actual and opportunity costs of the SOE portfolio,\nand  does  not  yet  count  future  debt-to-equity  swaps,  loan  foregiveness  in\nthe  context  of  Indonesia  Bank  Restructuring  Agency  (IBRA)  debt\nrestructurings, and liquidations. This total cost of $3.9 billion (Rp39 trillion)\nis equal to four times the expenditure for housing and human settlement,\nfive  times  the  expenditure  for  education,  and  eight  times  the  health\nexpenditure.\n\n\fObjectives\nand Scope\n\nii\n\nDespite  protection,  subsidies,  preferential  access  to  public  funding,  and\nguaranteed access to foreign  lending, investments in SOEs have  yielded\nsuboptimal  returns.  While  subsidization  of  SOEs  has  been  scaled  down\ndue  to  fiscal  pressures,  many  SOEs  have  raised  additional  debt  or\nstopped  servicing  their  debt  obligations  to  cover  operational  losses  and\nmeet day-to-day obligations. This mismanagement avoids tough measures\nin the nearterm, but it raises the long-term cost of SOE reforms.\n\nThe  proposed  Program  will  improve  resource  allocation  in  the  public\nsector,  increase  profitability  of  Indonesia\u2019s  SOEs,  and  promote  private\nsector participation in all commercial activities of SOEs. Reform of SOEs,\ninvolving  transfer  of  ownership  and  management,  and  confining  the\nGovernment\u2019s  role  to  improving  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework,  will\nrelease scarce resources for poverty reduction and social programs. This\nwill  be  achieved  by  (i)  subjecting  SOEs  to  sound  corporate  governance\npractices;  (ii)  separating  commercial  activities  of  SOEs  from  their  public\nservice  obligations; \n(iv)\nlabor\ntransparent  procedures \nestablishing \nredundancies;  and  (v)  strengthening  and  effectively  enforcing  guidelines\nfor procurement in SOEs.\n\nrestructuring  and  privatizing  SOEs; \n\nfor  managing \n\nfair  and \n\n(iii) \n\nClassification\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory B\n\nThe ADB Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\nThe  environmental  impact  of  the  Program  has  been  assessed  to  be\npositive.\n\nA  $400  million  program  loan  is  proposed  from  the  ordinary  capital\nresources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace\nperiod  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per\nannum,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0  percent,  conversion  options  that  may  be\nexercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan\nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion  guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and\nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.\n\nThe  Government  will  be  able  to  withdraw  funds  from  the  program  loan\naccount during a period of three years starting from loan effectiveness up\nto 31 December 2004. The loan will be disbursed in three tranches. The\nfirst tranche, equivalent to $150 million,1 will be made available upon the\nGovernment  meeting  the  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  second\ntranche,  amounting  to  $150  million,  is  expected  to  be  released  by\nJuly 2003 upon satisfactory compliance with agreed upon conditions. The\nthird  tranche,  amounting  to  $100  million,  is  expected  to  be  released  by\nJuly 2004 upon satisfactory compliance with agreed upon conditions.\n\n                                                     \n1 Upon  loan  effectiveness,  ADB  shall  be  entitled  to  withdraw  the  front-end  fee  from  the  loan  account,  and  pay\n\nitself on behalf of the Government.\n\n\fiii\n\nMinistry of Finance.\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nProcurement and\nDisbursement\n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be\nused to finance the cost of structural adjustments and activities consistent\nwith the Program.\n\nRisks and\nSafeguards\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  simplified  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related\nRequirements  for  Program  Loans,2  procurement  of  goods  and  services\nproduced  in  and  originating  from  ADB's  member  countries  will  be  made\nwith  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency  in  accordance  with\nstandard  Indonesian  public  sector  procedures  and  normal  private  sector\ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursement  of  the  loan\nproceeds  will  be  permitted  on  the  basis  of  a  certification  provided  by  the\nBorrower, confirming that in each year in which proceeds of the Program\nare expected to be disbursed, the value of total Indonesian imports minus\nimports,  and\n(i) \n(iii) imports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance,  will  be\nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amounts  expected  to  be  disbursed  during\nsuch year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and\nverify the validity of the certification issued by the Government with each\nwithdrawal application.\n\nfrom  nonmember  countries,  (ii) \n\nineligible \n\nimports \n\nThe implementation of the Program could be affected by several factors.\nThe principal risk relates to political uncertainty and its effect on the pace\nof structural reforms. However, there is a firm commitment to SOE reform\nat the highest levels in the new Government and consequently the risk of\nthe Program being diluted or abandoned is limited.\n\nrestructuring  and  subsequent  privatization  will \n\nThe  second  risk  stems  from  the  potential  opposition  of  vested  interests.\nFor instance, all the members of the board of commissioners of SOEs are\npublic  servants\u2014many  of  whom  have  limited  relevant  skills\u2014for  whom\nthe  monetary  and  fringe  benefits  provide  a  considerable  income.\ninvolve\nCorporate \nsignificant  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  boards  of  commissioners,\nand  hence,  loss  of  position,  income,  and  associated  social  prestige.\nFurthermore, many line ministries have traditionally used the SOEs as an\nadditional  source  of  revenue  to  finance  part  of  their  expenditures  and\nhave  enjoyed  wide  ranging  benefits  that  will  be  withdrawn.  To  counter\nresistance from these vested interests, the proposed system of corporate\ngovernance  is  designed  to  give  management  greater  authority  and\nautonomy, thereby reducing their willingness to collude with incompetent\nsupervising  commissioners.  Furthermore, \nthe  new  appointment\nagreements  for  directors  and  commissioners  will  radically  change  the\nincentive  systems  for  both  groups  by  linking  incentives  to  actual\nperformance.\n\nThe  third  risk  relates  to  the  lack  of  capacity  within  the  Government  to\neffectively oversee and monitor SOE reforms and restructuring in a timely\nand  effective  manner.  In  particular,  MOF  has  no  principal  experience  in\neither  corporate  restructuring  or  privatization.  To  address  this  concern,\n\n                                                     \n2 R50-98:  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  23  March\n\n1998.\n\n\fiv\n\ntechnical  assistance \n\nADB  has  provided \nthe\nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  in  financial  and  operational  analysis,  corporate\nrestructuring, \nlegal  aspects  of  restructuring  and  privatization,  and\ncorporate  governance.

This  is  the  third  change  of  leadership  in  Indonesia  over  the  last  4  years\n(1998-2001) after the 32 years rule of President Soeharto. Recognizing the urgency of restoring\npublic  and  investor  confidence,  within  a  month,  the  Government  was  able  to  reach  an\nagreement on the letter of intent (LOI) and supportive Memorandum of Economic and Financial\nPolicies  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Arrangements  are  under  way  to  hold  the\nConsultative Group Meeting for Indonesia in November 2001 and the meeting of the Paris Club\nto negotiate the rescheduling of Indonesia\u2019s debt.\n\n3.\nIndonesia,  like  other  regional  economies,  managed  to  achieve  a  degree  of  economic\nrecovery  as  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  4.8  percent  in  2000.  However,  the\ncountry faces significant challenges and has yet to fully reemerge from the severest effects of\nthe  economic  crisis,  when  GDP  declined  by  13.7  percent  in  1998  and  real  wages  and\nemployment  fell  and  poverty  rose.  Foreign  capital  flows  ceased  and  domestic  resource\nmobilization  declined  in  view  of  economic  uncertainty  and  contraction.  These  shocks,  and  the\nrecent  global  economic  slowdown,  have  adversely  affected  prospects  for  Indonesia  and  have\nrevealed the structural weakness and policy distortions.\n\n4.\nTo address these structural problems, IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development\nBank  (ADB)  have  together  provided  substantial  policy  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  support.\nADB\u2019s  Financial  Governance  Reforms:  Sector  Development  Program  (FGR:SDP),1  along  with\nIMF and World Bank assistance, has supported a set of public sector reforms that have created\nthe  basic  legal  framework  and  environment  for  SOE  reforms  and  their  audits,  and  helped  to\nimprove  financial  governance  in  both  banking  and  nonbanking  sectors.  The  Jakarta  Initiative\nTask  Force  (JITF)2  is  facilitating  out-of-court  debt  restructuring  agreements,  while  the\nIndonesian  Debt  Restructuring  Agency  (INDRA)  provides  exchange  rate  risk  guarantee  for\nrepayment  of  restructured  debt.  Recovery  of  nonperforming  loans  of  the  banking  sector  is  the\nresponsibility of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA).\n\nAlthough  Indonesia  has  made  substantial  progress  in  bank  restructuring,  the  corporate\n5.\nrestructuring  process \nfor  both  private  and  state  companies  has  been  slow.  Further\nrationalization  of  economic  policies  and  enhancement  of  governance  structures,  competition,\nand  market  orientation  are  critical  to  ensure  sustainable  economic  growth  and  efficiency  in\nresource  allocation.  Recognizing  this,  in  parallel  to  implementing  FGR:SDP  (footnote  1),  ADB\napproved  the  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Development\nLoan3 to enhance domestic and external competition and establish equal opportunities for small\nand medium-size enterprises.\n\n                                                          \n1 Loan  1618-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program,  for  $1.4  billion;  Loan  1619-INO:\nFinancial Governance Reforms Support,  for  $47  million; and  Loan  1620-INO: Capacity Building for Financial\nGovernance, for $50 million, all approved on 25 June 1998.\n\n2  Established in November 1999 with support from the World Bank.\n3  Loan  1738\u2013INO:  Industrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program,  for  $200\n\nmillion, approved on 16 March 2000.\n\n\f2\n\nTo coordinate corporate governance activities, the Government has set up the National\n6.\nCommittee  on  Corporate  Governance  (NCCG).  NCCG,  with  assistance  from  ADB,4  has\ndeveloped  a  framework  to  improve  corporate  governance,  introduced  amendments  to  the\nCompany  Law  and  other  commercial  laws  as  well  as  measures  to  streamline  company\nincorporation  and  registration  process,  and  improve  accounting  standards  and  disclosure\nrequirements.\n\n7.\nTo  facilitate  corporate  governance  reforms,  enterprise  restructuring,  and  privatization,\nthe  Government  established  the  Ministry  for  State-owned  Enterprises  (MSOE)  in  March 1998.\nWith  the  support  of  ADB,5  MSOE  prepared  a  masterplan  in  June  2000  that  laid  down  the\nobjectives and scope for the reform of SOEs. This plan envisaged the eventual privatization of\nmost  SOEs,  strengthening  of  their  governance,  and  restructuring  where  required,  while\nremoving  privileges  and  enhancing  credibility  of  the  Government  as  an  independent  and\nunbiased  regulator  and  arbitrator.  However,  MSOE  was  abolished  in  August  2000  and  its\nfunctions  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  While  these  institutional  changes\ndisrupted the privatization of SOEs, the Government continued its efforts to encourage SOEs to\nadopt the governance framework. The new Government reinstated MSOE in August 2001, and\nhas confirmed its commitment to implement the masterplan in a memorandum of understanding\nsigned on 03 October 2001. The strengthening of corporate governance in SOEs, as supported\nby  the  proposed  Program,  will  lead  the  way  for  improving  governance  in  the  whole  corporate\nsector,  as  well  as  in  other  commercial  operations  of  the  public  sector.  Concurrently,  the\nGovernment is planning to review legislation and regulatory framework for listed companies with\na view to improving enforcement.\n\nThe  ADB  Policy  Consultation  Mission  visited  Indonesia  in  September  1998,  and\n8.\ndiscussed  with  MSOE  and  other  key  agencies  the  issues  facing  the  SOE  sector  and  ADB's\npotential support for it. In December 1998, ADB approved an advisory TA to address corporate\ngovernance and privatization of SOEs (footnote 5). Subsequently, the Reconnaissance Mission\nwas  fielded  in  March-April  1999  to  develop  an  agenda  for  the  Program  on  the  basis  of  the\nrecommendations  of  the  ADB-financed  studies  and  the  SOE  masterplan  prepared  with  the\nWorld  Bank  assistance  (para.  52).  Fact-finding  was  undertaken  in  May  1999  to  formulate  the\nobjectives and scope of the Program and associated TAs and the understandings were firmed\nup during the Appraisal Mission in May 2000. However, the processing of the loan was delayed\nbetween  August  2000  and  September  2001  because  of  problems  arising  from  the  transfer  of\nMSOE  functions  to  MOF,  the  political  changes  stemming  from  the  President\u2019s  impeachment,\nand the delays in the resolution of issues surrounding the macroeconomic stabilization program\nand structural reforms. Following the resolution of these issues, in August 2001, ADB approved\na  TA  for  privatizing  and  restructuring  SOEs6  and  a  TA  for  commercializing  of  public  service\nobligations  (PSO),7  both  supporting  the  Program.  Subsequent  to  the  inauguration  of  the  new\nGovernment  and  reestablishment  of  MSOE,  a  follow-up  mission  in  September  20018  updated\nthe Program in light of emerging developments and firmed up understandings on the Program.\nThe  Government\u2019s  Development  Policy  Letter  and  the  attached  Policy  Matrix  are  given  in\n\n                                                          \n4 TA 3484-INO: Corporate Governance Reform, for $300,000, approved on 28 August 2000.\n5 TA  3149\u2013INO:  Corporate  Governance  and  Enterprise  Restructuring, \n\nfor  $2.47  million,  approved  on\n\n6 TA  3714-INO:  Privatization  and  Restructuring  of  State-Owned  Enterprises,  for  $2.6  million,  approved  on  5\n\n29 December 1998.\n\nSeptember 2001.\n\n7 TA 3728-INO: Commercialization of Public Service Obligations, for $1.0 million, approved on 25 September 2001.\n8 The Mission comprised K-P Kriegsmann, Senior Corporate Governance Specialist/Mission Leader; Michael Ryan,\n\nSenior Financial Sector Specialist; C.C. Fong, Senior Counsel; and Thatha Hla, Young Professional.\n\n\f3\n\nAppendix  1,  and  the  program  framework  and  its  monitoring  arrangements  are  provided  in\nAppendix 2.\n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n\n9.\nSince  the  onset  of  the  economic  crisis,  successive  Governments  have  implemented\nmacroeconomic  stabilization  programs  and  structural  reforms  to  address  the  short-  and\nmedium-term  challenges.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  to  date  in  this  area.  However,\nlack  of  public  confidence,  the  global  economic  slowdown,  and  the  slow  pace  of  structural\nreforms over the last several months have created new complications including the disruption to\nthe  process  of  economic  revival  and  fiscal  consolidation.  These  problems  were  created  by  a\nweak  domestic  economy  and  growing  political  tensions,  due  to  recurrent  civil  strife  and  ethnic\ntensions, the persistent calls for autonomy by resource rich provinces, and the global slowdown\nthat grew in the first half of 2001.\n\n10. \nThe  domestic  political  crisis  culminated  in  August  2001  with  Parliament  electing\nMegawati  Sukarnoputri  as  President.  Backed  by  considerable  popular  support,  the  President\nwas  swift  to  appoint  a  strong  and  competent  cabinet  and  is  striving  to  maintain  a  coalition  to\nbalance  diverse  and  conflicting  interests  in  Parliament.  Also,  the  Government  resumed  policy\ndialogue with the IMF that resulted in signing of an LOI and agreement on the Memorandum of\nEconomic and Financial Policies and paved the way for the release of the pending third tranche\nof the extended fund facility. The Government expects real GDP to grow in the range of 3.0-3.5\npercent in 2001. The macroeconomic stabilization program aims to adhere to curbing monetary\nexpansion  and  controlling  inflation,  and  has  adopted  measures  to  keep  the  budget  deficit  to\naround  4  percent  of  GDP.  These  targets  are  only  attainable  if  the  process  of  asset  recovery,\ncorporate restructuring, and privatization of SOEs is accelerated.\n\n11.\nThe  recent  change  in  Government  offers  renewed  hope  for  more  sustained  economic\nrecovery  of  the  Indonesian  economy,  but  the  vulnerabilities  persist  given  the  magnitude  of\neconomic issues and the difficult political environment. While growing public debt and the need\nto  rein  in  excess  liquidity  to  curb  inflation  limit  the  scope  for  pursuing  expansionary  fiscal  and\nmonetary  policies,  the  near-term  focus  will  be  on  accelerating  long-delayed  SOE  reforms,\ncorporate restructuring, and asset sales.\n\nDuring 2000, IBRA intensified its operations and managed net recoveries of $1.8 billion\n12.\n(Rp18.1 trillion) from asset sales. Building on this performance, IBRA plans to raise $2.7 billion\n(Rp27 trillion) in 2001 ($1.1 billion, or Rp10.5 trillion, had been recovered by 30 June) and $2.2\nbillion (Rp21.5 trillion) in 2002. MOF and IBRA have agreed on detailed procedures governing\nasset  transactions  and  sales  of  IBRA\u2019s  restructured  loans  for  sovereign  bonds.  For  the  21\nlargest obligors, memoranda of understanding have been agreed for debt resolutions and these\ncases  are  likely  to  be  legally  closed  in  2002.  IBRA  has  filed  legal  action  against  50\nnoncooperating  debtors,  amounting  to  $1.3  billion  (Rp13.0  trillion)  which  are  expected  to  be\nresolved in 2002. IBRA supervision was transferred from MOF to the state minister for SOEs in\nSeptember 2001 in order to accelerate bank and debt restructuring and to better coordinate the\noverall  asset  sales  program.  Debts  not  satisfactorily  resolved  through  voluntary  mechanisms\ncan  be  subjected  to  bankruptcy  proceedings.  The  Government  has  provided  a  supportive\n\n\f4\n\nregulatory  framework9  for  JITF-led  restructuring.  This  has  enabled  JITF  to  mediate  debt\namounting to $12 billion as of the end of June 2001, representing the debt of 54 companies.\n\n13.\nThe  Financial  Sector  Policy  Committee  (FSPC),  an  interministerial  coordinating\ncommittee  set  up  in  April  2000,  coordinates  the  activities  of  JITF,  INDRA,  IBRA,  Bank\nIndonesia,  MSOE,  and  MOF.  IBRA  is  empowered  to  take  over  assets  of  recalcitrant  debtors.\nThe  Government  can  direct  cases  to  JITF,  which  has  been  given  the  power  of  referral  to  the\nattorney  general  for  the  initiation  of  bankruptcy  proceedings  against  debtors  that  refuse  to\nnegotiate in good faith. These improvements to the debt restructuring strategy are expected to\ncreate  stronger  incentives  for  the  debtors  and  creditors  to  speed  up  debt  workouts.  In  April\n2001,  the  FSPC  published  a  set  of  principles  designed  to  promote  economically  viable\nrestructuring  of  distressed  companies  through  a  transparent  process  that  aims  to  maximize\nrecoveries. The principles also constrain IBRA from extending any future guarantees.\n\nincluded  strengthening  of  public  sector \n\nMajor initiatives have been under way to strengthen governance and combat corruption.\n14.\nThese  have \nthe\nestablishment of NCCG to develop a coherent framework for corporate governance for private\ncompanies  (para.  6).  Reforms  are  under  way  in  public  administration  to  enable  effective\ndecentralization.  To  combat  corruption,  the  Government  passed  two  new  laws,  on  \u201cclean\u201d\ngovernment,10  and  eradication  of  criminal  acts  of  corruption.11  Additionally,  a  law  for  the\noversight and audit of private foundations has been approved by Parliament in 2001. Effective\nimplementation  of  these  laws  and  proper  role  of  oversight  agencies  is  critical  to  implement\nefficient,  transparent,  and  accountable  public  administration,  and  to  encourage  citizen\nparticipation.\n\nfinancial  management,  and \n\n15. Within this context, the implementation of a rigorous system of corporate governance for\nSOEs  is  critical  and  is  viewed  to  lead  the  reforms  for  the  overall  corporate  sector.  Successful\ncorporate  restructuring,  especially  debt  restructuring,  of  SOEs  provide  models  to  accelerate\nrelated  efforts  in  the  private  sector.  Privatizations  through  stock  exchange  listing  will  promote\ncapital  market  development.  SOE  reforms  will  also  establish  the  best  practices  in  managing\nlabor redundancies.\n\nB.\n\nRecent Performance and Prospects\n\n16.\nOver the past five years, Indonesia has shown remarkable resilience and lived through\nan unprecedented economic crisis and the associated political and social unrest. Despite these\nevents,  the  economy  showed  resilience  and  real  GDP  grew  to  4.8  percent  in  2000  after\nregistering  a  sharp  contraction  by  13.2 percent  in  1998.  The  growth  prospects  for  2001,\nhowever, have weakened in light of the continued weak domestic demand, sharp slowdown in\nexports  triggered  by  global  slowdown,  political  uncertainties,  and  protracted  delays  in  the\ncorporate restructuring process. Real GDP growth is estimated to be in the range of 3.0 to 3.5\npercent in 2001 (para. 10).\n\n17.\nTo maintain macroeconomic stability, the Government in 2001 has kept a close watch on\nfiscal management. Despite monetary tightening in the first half of the year, monetary expansion\nrose to 18.5 percent on an annualized basis over the second quarter of 2001. The slippage is\n\n                                                          \n9 These include the introduction of tax relief for a broad range of restructuring transactions, and regulatory protection\n\nat the Jakarta Stock Exchange to prevent delisting for cooperating companies.\n\n10 The law State Administrators who are Clean and Free from Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism, defines rights and\n\n11 The Eradication of Corruption Criminal Act defines corruption and declares it a criminal act to be punished with four\n\nobligations of state administrators.\n\nto twenty years imprisonment.\n\n\f5\n\nlargely  on  account  of  the  downward  pressures  on  the  exchange  rate,  which  fell  to  lows  of\nRp12,000 to the dollar in April 2001 (compared to Rp7500 in April 2000) at the peak of political\nuncertainty.  Following  the  impeachment  of  President  Wahid  on  23  July  2001,  the  rupiah\nappreciated by 30 percent but subsequently fell back to its current level of about Rp10, 500 per\nUS$1. The steep fall in the value of rupiah, Bank Indonesia\u2019s failure to control liquidity, and the\nrise in fuel prices during 2001, created strong inflationary pressures. By July 2001 the 12 month\nincrease in consumer prices reached a two-year high of 14 percent, up from 4.2 percent a year\nearlier. Higher inflation and political uncertainty resulted in a rise of interest rates. The yield on\nthe  one-month  central  bank  certificates  (SBIs)  stood  at  17.6  percent  in  late  August  2001,  up\nfrom 14.5 percent at the end of 2000.\n\n18.\nThe  current  account  surplus  increased  from  4  percent  of  GDP  in  1999  to  5  percent  in\n2000 but is expected to contract significantly during 2001. Weaker external demand and lower\nnatural gas exports will not be fully offset by the projected fall in imports. Maintaining a current\naccount  surplus  is  of  vital  importance  for  Indonesia  to  be  able  to  meet  its  debt  servicing\nobligations  as  capital  inflows  are  likely  to  remain  constrained  well  into  and  possibly  beyond\n2002. IMF and World Bank are projected to have negative net lending (repayments are higher\nthan disbursements) amounting to about $1.0 billion in 2001 and 2002. Commercial banks and\nother  private  creditors  are  expected  to  reduce  their  exposure  by  $8.6  billion  in  2001  and  $6.0\nbillion in 2002. This leaves a net financing gap of $1.5 billion in 2001 and $2.4 billion in 2002 in\nthe  capital  account  of  the  balance  of  payments,  which  should  be  met  by  multi-  and  bilateral\ndevelopment agencies.\n\n19.\nThe economic slowdown during the first half of 2001 has imposed severe strains on the\nbudget. In line with the IMF program, the Government has scaled its budget deficit target to 3.7\npercent of GDP by raising tax revenues by $650 million (Rp6.5 trillion) and reducing subsidies\nby  $930  million  (Rp9.3  trillion).  Parliament  in  mid-June  passed  the  new  budget.  Managing  a\nresponsive, yet responsible, fiscal policy is an urgent concern. Among others, it is critical to deal\nwith the issue of the massive buildup of public debt to $127 billion (Rp1,270 trillion). By the end\nof 2000, this is close to 100 percent of GDP. About half the debt is owed to foreign creditors,\nincluding $20 billion to multilateral institutions, $43 billion to bilateral creditors, and $2.4 billion to\nforeign  banks  and  bondholders.  Interest  payments  alone  currently  absorb  31  percent  of\nbudgetary  revenues,  curbing  the  availability  of  resources  to  address  social  development\npriorities.  The  Government  plans  to  launch  an  aggressive  sale  of  IBRA  assets  and  SOEs  to\nmobilize the required resources for debt repayments. Sound macroeconomic policies supported\nby  prudent  fiscal  management  and  proper  and  timely  implementation  of  privatization  of  SOEs\nwill  be  critical  for  meeting  these  goals.  In  view  of  the  important  role  of  privatizations  for  future\nbudgets, the Government has placed a high priority on SOE reform.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA.\n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\n1. \n\nOverview of Corporate Sector and Structure of SOEs\n\n20.\nThe economic vulnerability of Indonesia, as exposed by the crisis, is largely attributable\nto  the  inherent  structural  weaknesses  across  key  sectors  of  the  economy.  In  the  corporate\nsector,  the  complex  holding  company  structures  with  concurrent  ownership  of  banks\nencouraged the development of a web of nontransparent and highly leveraged conglomerates.\nThese conglomerates indulged in lending to related parties, expanded their operations without\ndue regard for economic or prudential considerations, exploited depositors of their banks, and\ndispossessed  minority  shareholders  who  held  stakes  in  their  listed  subsidiaries.  Excessive\n\n\f6\n\nleveraging, without adequate prudential regulatory framework and supervision, overexposed the\nfragile  domestic  banking  sector.  Reckless  lending  and  borrowing  were  worsened  by  currency\nand maturity mismatch in the banks\u2019 balance sheets. Following the currency devaluation, a large\nsegment  of  the  corporate  sector  became  insolvent.  Corporate  losses  and  the  inability  and\nunwillingness  to  repay  debt  obligations  wiped  out  the  equity  of  many  banks  that  were  overly\nexposed  to  commercial  and  speculative  adventures  of  their  majority  owners.  Although  less\nleveraged and not so severely affected by the crisis as private enterprises, SOEs too suffered\nfrom growing operational and financial inefficiencies, and many require restructuring.\n\n21.\n\nAt a general level, Law No. 9/1969 provides for four main types of SOEs:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nperusahaan jawatan (perjan), government departmental agencies established to\nfulfill  PSOs,  do  not  have  separate  legal  existence,  their  employees  are  civil\nservants, and 15 perjan are under MSOE administration;\nperusahaan umum (perum), were established as separate legal entities under a\nspecial purpose Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah), their capital is\nowned  by  the  Government  and  is  not  divided  into  shares,  and  13  perum  are\nunder MSOE administration;\nperusahaan persero (persero) is a limited liability company established according\nto Law No. 9/1969 and the Company Law, and at least 51 percent of its shares\nare owned directly by the Government;12 and\nother types of SOEs can be established under special laws; an example is the oil\ncompany, Pertamina.\n\nAs  of  September  2001,  MSOE  has  a  portfolio  of  155  companies  comprising  five fully-\n22.\nowned  state  banks;  12  nonbank  financial  institutions;  21  companies  with  the  Government  as\nminority  shareholder;  and  117  fully-owned  nonfinancial  SOEs,  which  are  the  primary  target  of\nthe proposed Program. Four SOEs are not to be privatized before 2008.13 A breakdown of the\n113  remaining  SOEs  is  given  in  Table  1,  the  coverage  of  SOEs  by  the  different  program\ncomponents is outlined in Appendix 3.\n\n2. \n\nSize and Significance of State-Owned Enterprises\n\n23.\nTraditionally,  SOEs  have  operated  in  all  key  sectors  of  the  economy.  In  1999,  total\nassets  of  the  113  SOEs  (book  value)  to  be  privatized  (para.  22)  were  $39  billion  (Rp391\ntrillion),14  equivalent  to  42  percent  of  the  total  assets  of  Indonesia\u2019s  producing  sector.  SOEs\nemployed  655,000  persons  on  a  full-time  basis.  However,  including  their  subsidiaries  and  the\ncontract  and  subcontract  workers,  the  total  workforce  of  SOEs  was  close  to  1.4 million,  or  18\npercent  of  the  workforce  in  large  and  medium  enterprises.  The  contribution  of  SOEs  to  the\ncountry's  GDP  was  estimated  at  12 percent,  indicating  a  relatively  low  efficiency  in  the  use  of\nlabor and assets.\n\n                                                          \n12 There are 134 perseros under MSOE administration.\n13 The  four  SOEs  are  PT  Batan  Teknologi,  producer  of  isotops  for  medical  radiology;  PT  Pakarya  Industri,  holding\ncompany  for  strategic  SOEs  (proposed  for  liquidation);  PT  TWC  Borobudur,  providing  administration  services  for\nhistoric monuments in Yogyakarta; and PT Pindad, an ammunition manufacturer.\n\n14 $53.2 billion at the 1999 foreign exchange rate (Rp7,350); excluding assets of insurance companies.\n\n\f7\n\nTable 1: Breakdown of Nonfinancial SOEs\nFinancial Year Ended 2000\n\nSector\n\nNumber\n\nShare in Assets (%)\n\nEnergy\nInfrastructure\nPost\nTelecommunications\nToll Roads\nPorts\nAirports\n\nPrimary industries\nPlantations\nFishing\nForestry\nMining\nAgricultural Inputs\n\nShare in Workforce\n(%)\n8.3\n14.4\n4.1\n6.4\n1.0\n1.8\n1.8\n55.5\n51.5\n0.4\n1.4\n2.3\n0.1\n9.6\n1.0\n0.8\n9.9\n100.0\n\n2a\n10\n1a\n2\n1a\n4\n2\n29\n14\n4\n5\n4\n2\n31\n10\n5\n26\n113\n\n61.7\n13.7\n0.5\n9.1\n1.8\n1.6\n1.6\n5.1\n2.8\n0.1\n0.5\n1.6\n0.1\n11.7\n1.3\n1.3\n5.2\n100.0\n\nManufacturing\nConstruction\nTrade\nServices\nTotal\nAddendum:\nSOEs not to be privatized\nBanks\nNonbank Financial\nInstitutions\nMinority Shareholdings\nTotal Portfolio\na Reforms of these SOEs are dealt with under ongoing World Bank and ADB loans and TAs (para. 57).\nSource: Ministry for State-Owned Enterprises.\n\n4\n5\n12\n\n21\n155\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Performance of State-Owned Enterprises\n\nIn 1999, SOEs15 accounted for 15 percent of Indonesia\u2019s total exports and 19 percent of\n24.\nnonmineral fuel exports in US dollar terms. Benefiting from currency depreciation, SOE exports\nregistered a windfall of $600 million (Rp6 trillion) in 1998, which declined to about $400 million\n(Rp4  trillion)  in  1999  and  $250  million  (Rp2.5  trillion)  in  2000.  In  2001  the  weak  currency  is\nexpected  to  increase  the  windfall  to  about  $450  million  (Rp4.5  trillion).  This  contributed  to\nenhanced  operating  profit  that  rose  from  $730  million  (Rp7.3  trillion)  in  1997  to  $1.6  billion\n(Rp15.6 trillion) in 2000. The return on assets in the SOE sector increased from 3.3 percent in\n1997 to 6.9 percent in 2000, but still remained below the cost of capital. The rise in profitability\ndoubled  the  contribution  of  SOEs  to  the  budget  in  the  form  of  dividends,  from  $150  million\n(Rp1.5  trillion)  in  1997  to  $350  million  (Rp3.5 trillion)  in  2000.  However,  with  the  slowing\ndomestic  economy  and  the  rise  in  cost  of  inputs  and  labor,  improved  profitability  of  SOEs  is\nunlikely  to  be  sustained  in  2001.  The  forecast  for  2001  in  Table  2,  on  the  basis  of  company\nbudgets submitted to MSOE in January 2001, are probably too optimistic.\n\n                                                          \n15 The financial data in this section excludes PT PLN because of its extraordinary circumstances and distorting effect\n\non the data.\n\n\f8\n\n25.\nOverall, the financial position of SOEs has remained mediocre in recent years (Table 2).\nAn  example  has  been  the  rapid  growth  in  losses  of  the  power  utility,  PT  Perusahaan  Listrik\nNegara  (PLN),  because  of  its  inability  to  adjust  electricity  tariffs  in  line  with  rising  input  prices\nand  debt  servicing  costs.16  The  decline  of  shareholder  value  in  SOEs,  as  assessed  by  the\neconomic  value-added  (EVA)17  concept,  is  estimated  at  $1.4  billion  (Rp13.9 trillion)  in  2000,\nequivalent  to  180  percent  of  social  expenditures  in  2000.  Including  PLN,  EVA  is  estimated  at\nnegative  $3.7  billion  (Rp36.7  trillion),  equal  to  2.8  percent  of  GDP,  or  17.9 percent  of\ngovernment revenue and grants in 2000.\n\nTable 2: Aggregate Financial Data for\nSelected Industries\n\nIndustry\n\nYear\n\nEmployees\n\nAssets\n(Rp\u2019000)\n\nOperating\nProfit Margin\n\nReturn on\nAssets\n\nDebt Equity\nRatio\n\nPlantations\n\nMining\n\nManufacturing\n\nInfrastructure\nexc.

If EVA is positive, the company creates shareholder value. If\nEVA is negative, the company destroys shareholder value. In the portfolio of MSOE of 134 SOEs, only seven SOE\ncreated shareholder value (positive EVA) in 2000.\n\n\f9\n\n26.     Despite their poor profitability, proceeds from the sale of SOEs could finance a part of the\nbank  restructuring  cost.  Based  on  the  2000  net  profit  after  tax,  the  market  value  of  all  SOEs,\nexcluding  banks,  is  estimated  to  be  in  the  range  of  Rp126  trillion  (staff  estimate)  and\nRp208 trillion  (Government  estimate),  or  $13  billion  to  $22  billion.  This  is  equivalent  to  60\npercent  and  102 percent,  respectively,  of  the  market  capitalization  of  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange\n(JSE).\n\nB. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n1. \n\nCorporate Governance\n\nEight  SOEs  are  listed  on  JSE18  (including  Bank  BNI)  and  subject  to  capital  market\n27.\nregulation.  The  other  126  SOEs  are  limited  liability  companies,  subject  only  to  the  corporate\ngovernance  provisions  of  the  Company  Law.  To  adequately  monitor  their  performance  and\nguide  corporate  restructuring  efforts,  MSOE,  in  a  first  step,  needs  to  raise  the  governance  of\nthese SOEs to the level required for publicly listed companies. However, corporate governance\nin SOEs involves more complex problems compared to those prevailing in enterprises listed on\na  stock  exchange.  The  supervisory  board  and  management  of  SOEs  are  quite  removed  from\ndirect accountability to the shareholders. They have no direct responsibility toward the ultimate\nshareholder, the  taxpayer, nor do  the taxpayers have any legal means of seeing their interest\nrepresented.  In  May  2000  Indonesia  introduced  specific  rules  and  regulations  for  corporate\ngovernance  in  SOEs.19  Furthermore,  external  mechanisms  of  corporate  governance  enforced\nthrough  financial  markets  or  banks,  have  also  been  largely  absent  as  SOEs  enjoyed  easy\naccess to credit from state-owned banks and directly from MOF. SOEs have, therefore, tended\nto  mainly  serve  the  interests  of  the  state  bureaucracy  leading  to  such  excesses  as  directed\nallocation  of  contracts  to  favored  suppliers;  use  of  profits  to  support  nonviable  new  ventures;\nand  outright  corruption,  collusion,  and  nepotism  (KKN).  To  overcome  these  problems,  MSOE\nneeds  to  implement  a  system  of  corporate  governance  that  overcomes  the  shortcomings\noutlined  on  paras.  28-35,  and  goes  beyond  the  prescriptions  of  capital  market  regulations.\nThereby it will pioneer the way for the Government\u2019s efforts to improve corporate governance for\nthe private sector, to be designed and implemented by NCCG (para. 6). In a first step, NCCG\nhas  issued  a  Code  of  Good  Corporate  Governance  in  April  2001,  fully  complying  with  the\nOrganization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  Principles  of  Corporate\nGovernance.  However,  compliance  with  the  code  by  companies  is  voluntary  until  the  code  is\nreflected  in  the  new  company  law  and  capital  market  law,  envisaged  to  be  enacted  by\nParliament in 2002.\n\n28.\nThe Civil Code, the Commercial Code, the Company Law and its regulations provide the\nlegal and regulatory framework for the establishment, operation, and dissolution of companies\nwith  limited  liability,  and  the  rights,  liabilities,  and  responsibilities  of  shareholders,  managers\n(directors),  and  supervisors  (commissioners).  Securities  issuers,  and  public  and  listed\ncompanies  are  subject  to  capital  market  laws  and  regulations.  The  Company  Law  applies  to\nlisted  companies,  except  where  capital  market  regulations  prevail.  SOEs  covered  under  the\nProgram are limited liability companies governed by the Company Law. SOEs listed at JSE are\nadditionally  subject  to  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Capital  Market  Supervisory  Agency\n(BAPEPAM). Listed companies are additionally subject to the listing rules of JSE.\n\n29.\nThe  internal  governance  of  companies  as  defined  in  the  Company  Law  provides  for\na dual  board  structure  for  limited  liability  companies.  The  board  of  directors  (BOD)  is\n                                                          \n18 The six SOEs named in footnote 32 plus PT Indofarma and PT Biofarma, which were listed in 2001.\n19 Ministerial Decree Kep 23 of May 2001, Corporate Governance in SOEs, issued by the Minister for Investment and\n\nSOEs.\n\n\f10\n\nresponsible  for  the  management  of  a  company,  while  the  board  of  commissioners  (BOC)\nmonitors and advises them.20 The annual general meeting of shareholders has broad authority\nas it holds powers generally not granted by the Company Law or by the company\u2019s articles of\nassociation to the BOD or BOC. The Company Law does not, however, stipulate consequences\nfor  a  company\u2019s  failure  to  comply  with  its  provisions.  Regulation  of  the  corporate  sector  is\noverseen by the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Industry and Trade, District Courts, commercial\ncourts, BAPEPAM, and JSE (for listed companies). Licensing and regulatory responsibilities for\ncompanies that are engaged in commercial activities are with the concerned sector ministries.\nBank Indonesia and MOF regulate the banking and insurance sectors, respectively.\n\n30.\nThe BOD of a company must administer, and allow for the inspection by shareholders of,\nthe  company\u2019s  books  and  records.  However,  the  Company  Law  does  not  specify  what  books\nand records must be maintained. To be meaningful, the reports should provide audited financial\nstatements,21 describe the management and operations of the company, and list the names and\nremuneration of the members of the BOD and BOC, as well as their interest in the company and\nthe company\u2019s commercial transactions.\n\n31.\nAudits  of  a  company\u2019s  financial  statements  are  not  compulsory.  Listed  companies  or\ncompanies  involved  in  public  fund-raising  or  those  that  have  issued  an  acknowledgment  of\nindebtedness,  or  companies  with  assets  valued  at  least  Rp50  billion  (which  is  the  case  for\n107 of the 117 SOEs) are required to prepare an annual report. Since 1998, these companies\nare  required  to  provide  their  annual  report  to  the  Minister  of  Industry  and  Trade22  within  six\nmonths from the end of their financial year along with audited financial statements prepared in\naccordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP).  Compliance  to  date  has\nbeen  very  poor.  Public  companies  and  securities  issuers  are  required  to  submit  annual  and\nquarterly  reports  and  financial  statements  to  BAPEPAM  with  information  on  their  company\nactivities;  their  BODs  and  BOCs;  use  of  funds;  and  investment  and  share  ownership  of\ndirectors,  commissioners,  and  shareholders.  While  the  reporting  requirements  are  substantial,\ncompliance has been weak, and largely depending on the integrity of management.\n\n32.\nThe Indonesian generally accepted accounting standards (GAAP) are determined by the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (Dewan Standar Akuntansi Keunangan, or DSAK), which\nis  part  of  the  Indonesian  Institute  of  Accountants  (IIA).  Together  with  the  regulations  for  listed\ncompanies stipulated by BAPEPAM, they define financial accounting standards. In 1994, DSAK\nmade the strategic decision to harmonize the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards with\nthe International Accounting Standards (IAS). The DSAK has issued 55 accounting standards,\n35 in 1994 and 20 over the last six years, which are consistent with the recommendations of the\nInternational  Accounting  Standards  Committee.  Although  IAS  are  not  commonly  adopted  by\nIndonesian  companies,  in  most  cases  there  is  little  difference  between  IAS  and  Indonesian\nGAAP.\n\n                                                          \n20 Indonesian law is based on Dutch law and prescribes a two-board structure consisting of supervisory board and an\nexecutive  board.  Under  the  Indonesian  law,  the  commissioners  are  the  equivalent  of  nonexecutive  directors  in\nEuropean  companies  and  form  the  BOC,  vested  with  all  supervisory  functions,  while  the  Directors  are  the\nequivalent of executive Directors in European companies and form the BOD, which is responsible for managing all\ncompany  affairs.  By  contrast,  under  the  Anglo-Saxon  law  system,  companies  with  limited  liability  have  one  BOD\nconsisting of executive Directors and non-executive Directors.\n\n21 Including a balance sheet, a profit and loss statement, a cash flow statement, a statement of debt and receivables\n\n(including bank credits), a list of shareholders, and explanatory notes.\n\n22 Decree  of  the  Minister  of  Industry  and  Trade  No.  525/Kep/XI/1998  of  13  November  1998  on  Administration  and\nRegistration  of  Annual  Financial  Reports  of  Companies.  Currently,  the  Minister  of  Industry  and  Trade  has\ndelegated the relevant authority to the Company Registration Office in the Department of Industry and Trade.\n\n\f11\n\n33.\n  Overall,  Indonesia's  corporate  and  commercial  system  is  not  working  under  a  robust\nsystem  of  corporate  governance.  Existing  rules  and  regulations  have  not  been  rigorously\nenforced, in private companies or SOEs. External mechanisms and enforcement through banks\nand  capital  markets,  which  are  a  feature  of  corporate  discipline  in  other  countries,  have  not\nfunctioned well in Indonesia. There has been little incentive for internal mechanisms or voluntary\nbest  practices  to  be  introduced.  As  a  result,  the  following  mechanisms  common  in  other\ncountries are either unavailable or only nominally available:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe \n\ncomprehensive  disclosure  in  corporate  reporting,  independent  directors  or\nrights  of  minority  shareholders,  and\ncommissioners  safeguarding \ntransparency in financial dealings with related parties;\nsound legal system, with a good record of enforcement by an impartial judiciary\n(breaches  in  corporate  governance,  even  if  detected,  were  not  pursued  for\njudicial resolution); and\nexternal  discipline  exercised  by  the  financial  sector  (for  a  complex  web  of  well-\nconnected  individuals  and  conglomerates,  capital  was  readily  available  before\nthe crisis).\n\n34.\nApart  from  enforcement  of  general  standards,  corporate  governance  should  establish\nproper  ownership  and  control  structures  for  SOEs  that  align  risk  borne  by  owners  with\nmanagement  control  to  improve  their  financial  and  operational  performance.  A  fundamental\nproblem  in  SOEs  is  that  those  who  bear  the  risk  of  losses\u2014the  public\u2014can  neither  control\noperations nor escape losses. For the internal governance of corporatized SOEs to be effective,\nthe  Government  needs  to  enforce  rigorous  accountability  and  transparency,  and  provide\nautonomy  and  adequate  incentives  to  supervisors,  managers,  and  employees  to  meet\ncommercial objectives.\n\n35.\nContractual  arrangements  between  the  shareholder,  BOC  and  BOD,  where  they  exist,\nare  not  uniform  or  transparent,  and  do  not  establish  clear  accountability.  Consequently,  it  is\ndifficult to assess the performance of BOCs and BODs whose appointments in most cases are\nnot based on merit. As a consequence of the lack of systematic contractual arrangements and\nadequate  management  information  systems,  MSOE  has  only  rudimentary  knowledge  of  the\nSOEs  in  its  portfolio.  Internal  organizational  and  capacity  constraints  have  limited  responsible\nGovernment  agencies\u2019  ability  to  develop  information-processing  capabilities.  The  SOEs\ngenerally  disregard  their  legal  obligation  to  file  audited  financial  statements  with  the  Company\nRegister.  Since  MOF  represents  the  Government  as  the  sole  shareholder  in  134  SOEs,  it\nshould  have  regular  and  unlimited  access  to  the  relevant  financial,  operational,  and  strategic\ninformation of SOEs.\n\n2.\n\nPublic Service Obligations\n\n36.\nThe Government has in many cases used SOEs to provide public goods and services to\nthe  population.  These  range  from  transportation  services  in  remote  areas  to  vocational\neducation  and  health  care  services.  Political  interference  in  the  pricing  of  such  services  and\ninadequate  accountability  in  SOEs  have  resulted  in  inefficient  delivery  mechanisms.  The\nservices are either cross-subsidized by profitable business units in the SOE or subsidized by the\nGovernment.  This  practice  diverts  resources  from  profitable  activities,  lowers  overall  returns,\nand  impairs  the  growth  potential  of  SOEs,  while  eliminating  incentives  for  efficiency  in  the\nprovision  of  PSOs.  Currently  a  large  segment  of  SOEs  are  entrusted  with  PSOs,  such  as\nobligations to provide for reforestation services in Sumatra and Kalimantan, supply vaccines at\nbelow  cost  prices  to  the  public  health  system,  maintain  unprofitable  air  and  shipping  services,\nand  operate  remote  air  and  sea  ports.  PSOs  should  be  contracted  out  separately  and\n\n\f12\n\ntransparently to ensure full cost recovery by their provider. The Government has corrected some\ntariff  and  other  fiscal  distortions  as  part  of  its  structural  adjustment  program,  but  subsidies,\ncross-subsidies within SOEs, and directed price fixing continue. To increase transparency and\nachieve  full  management  accountability  for  commercial  success,  the  Government  needs  to\nseparate PSOs from commercial activities in SOEs in preparation for their eventual privatization.\nWithout  such  separation,  SOEs  cannot  achieve  a  return  on  capital  sufficient  to  attract  private\ninvestors.\n\n3. \n\nCorporate Restructuring\n\n37.\nCorporate  restructuring  includes  financial  (debt)  and  operational  restructuring.  To  date,\n10  SOEs  have  reached  debt-restructuring  agreements  with  their  creditors,  8  have  ongoing\nnegotiations, and 1 has been sued for bankruptcy.23 The financial restructuring of SOEs (except\nbanks) has proceeded slowly as (i) the Government is not pressing for debt restructuring as it\nmay add to the already high fiscal costs incurred in bank restructuring, and (ii) creditors (in the\nmajority state-owned banks) are reluctant to pursue SOEs with the same vigor as private sector\ndebtors. Financial restructuring is needed in at least 40 SOEs with unsustainably high levels of\ndebt,  16  of  which  have  IBRA  as  the  main  counterpart  in  their  debt  restructuring  negotiations.\nThe  other  24  SOEs  have  state-owned  banks  and  MOF  as  their  main  creditors.  Another  17\nSOEs have debts that are with IBRA and are expected to be resolved on commercial terms.\n\nlabor, \n\nrestructuring \n\nthe  crisis.  Operational \n\nOperational  restructuring  is  needed  in  at  least  87  SOEs  given  their  poor  operational\n38.\nperformance  even  before \nrequires  adequate\n(i) management  information  systems,  (ii) production  and  logistics  planning,  (iii) distribution\nnetwork,  (iv)  marketing  strategy,  (v) workforce  number  and  composition,  (vi) organizational\nstructure,  and  (vii)  separation  of  PSOs  from  commercial  operations.  SOEs  have  about  10-20\npercent24  excess \ninadequate  strategic  planning,\nunreliable  distribution  networks,  and  no  long-term  marketing  strategy.  An  approach  to  SOE\ncorporate  restructuring  is  to  involve  the  private  sector  at  an  early  stage,  but  the  widespread\ninsolvency has complicated this option as few domestic banks or corporations have resources\nto  lend  to  or  invest  in  the  SOE  sector.  Even  fewer  have  the  managerial  capacity  to  acquire\nnonperforming  state  assets  and  to  turn  them  around.  The  alternative  is  to  restructure  viable\nSOEs  with  the  objective  of  eventual  privatization  involving  overseas  portfolio  and  strategic\ninvestors. However, where restructuring involves the injection of fresh capital, it has to be left to\nfuture private owners.\n\ninflexible  production  processes, \n\nThe Government is committed to support financial and operational restructuring of SOEs\n39.\nand their privatization without, however, supporting new investments for merger, modernization,\nor expansion of existing production facilities.25 Corporate restructuring of SOEs will complement\nand reinforce the tasks of (i) JITF which is facilitating the voluntary resolution of corporate debt;\n(ii) IBRA,  charged  with  resolving  or  liquidating  non-performing  loans  in  its  portfolio;  and  (iii)\nINDRA,  which  facilitates  the  conversion  of  foreign  currency-denominated  debt  into  rupiah  at\nguaranteed  exchange  rates.  Together,  these  initiatives  are  to  assist  almost  2,000  private  and\npublic  sector  enterprises.  Consistent  with  these  initiatives,  the  Government  identified  for\nfinancial restructuring 60 SOEs, 40 of which require urgent action (para. 42). Furthermore, MOF\nwill  not  provide  financial  restructuring  support  to  any  SOEs  that  can  self-finance  their\nrestructuring program, or will not be privatized, or require regulatory reform prior to restructuring\n\n                                                          \n23 The Vietnam Frontier Fund filed a bankruptcy suit in May 1999 against PT Dok and Perkapalan Kodja for its failure\n\nto pay $100 million in promissory notes.\n\n24 Based on some recent estimates, the actual level of overstaffing may be closer to 10 percent.\n25 The Government has demonstrated this commitment in the case of PT Indo Farma and PT Kimia Farma, where the\n\nproceeds from the IPO went to the companies to be used for corporate restructuring.\n\n\f13\n\nand privatization. These SOEs will, however, receive support under the proposed Program for\ncomplying  with  regulatory  reforms,  improving  corporate  governance,  applying  anticorruption\nmeasures, and offering voluntary retirement schemes.\n\n40.\nThe  Government  plans  to  reform  SOEs  with  long-term  viability  whose  value  to  a\npotential investor would be enhanced by financial and operational restructuring, and to consider\nfor immediate sale or liquidation those that have no commercial viability and lack any value as\ngoing  concerns.  Preliminary  analysis  indicates  that  at  least  14 SOEs  lack  commercial  and\nfinancial viability.\n\n(iii) protecting  debtor\u2019s  assets \n\n41.\nFinancial  restructuring  will  take  place  within  a  well-defined  legal  framework,  enforced\nthrough  newly  established  institutional  arrangements.  Commercial  courts,  which  constitute  a\npart  of  the  general  court  system,  have  the  mandate  of  hearing  bankruptcy  and  commercial\ncases relating to arbitration, competition, and security issues. These courts are entrusted with\nthe  application  and  enforcement  of  the  Bankruptcy  Law  to  facilitate  and  encourage  corporate\ndebt  restructuring.  The  Bankruptcy  Law,  amended  substantially  in  1998,  aims  at  (i)  improving\nthe speed and transparency of cases; (ii) drawing receivers and administrators from the private\nsector; \ntransactions);\n(against \n(iv) facilitating  the  foreclosure  on  collateral  by  secured  creditors;  and  (v)  accelerating  out-of-\ncourt settlements with the consent of at least 50 percent of unsecured creditors, representing no\nless  than  two-thirds  of  outstanding  claims.  Debtors  and  creditors  failing  to  reach  out-of-court\nworkout settlements under JITF, or to get the requisite creditor support for the workout plan, can\nresort  to  the  commercial  court  to  bind  hold-out  creditors,26  impose  strict  guidelines  on  the\nnegotiating process, or  achieve  liquidation of the company. However, public confidence in the\ncommercial  courts  is  still  low,  since  they  do  not  function  efficiently  or  address  problems  of\nfinancially  distressed  companies.  As  such,  they  do  not  yet  provide  adequate  support  for\ncorporate restructuring being pursued under JITF.\n\ninsider  and \n\nfraudulent \n\n4. \n\nLabor Redundancies\n\n42.\nAs  mentioned  in  para.  38,  SOEs  need  to  reduce  employment  by  10  to  20  percent.\nSupport  for  SOEs  to  finance  labor  retrenchment  and  training  will  improve  their  prospects  for\nsuccessful  restructuring  and  privatization.  Such  retrenchment  will  be  guided  by  Indonesia\u2019s\nlabor laws, which are of high standard. In 1998, Indonesia signed an LOI with the International\nLabour  Organization  (ILO)  for  the  ratification  of  ILO's  seven  core  conventions.  These  include\nfreedom  of  association,  and  freedom  from  forced  labor,  discrimination,  and  child  labor.  As  of\nJanuary  2000,  Indonesia  is  the  only  country  in  Asia  to  have  ratified  all  the  seven  core\nconventions.  A  tripartite  task  force  consisting  of  unions,  the  Government,  and  employers  has\nbeen  established  and  is  working  with  ILO  in  the  implementation  of  labor  standards.27  The\nratification of ILO Convention 87 regarding the right of association has enabled SOE employees\nto join a union or engage in collective labor arrangements, though procedures for resolution of\nlabor  disputes  still  have  to  be  clarified.  During  the  past  24  months,  102  labor  unions  have\nregistered  or  are  in  the  process  of  registering  with  Ministry  of  Manpower  (MOM).  If  no  union\nexists, an association with an elected spokesperson can represent employees to management.\n\n43.\nThe  threat  of  unemployment  because  of  liquidation,  privatization,  and  restructuring  of\nSOEs  is  a  matter  of  concern  to  all  employees  due  to  uncertainties  about  settlement  of  their\nseverance  claims  and  the  prospect  of  privatization  in  general.  Since  1997,  10 SOEs  have\n                                                          \n26 The  court  can  force  creditors  delaying  a  restructuring  agreement  to  accept  it  if  a  qualified  majority  of  creditors\n\n27 Three draft laws are currently waiting for processing by Parliament: (i) trade unions law, (ii) dispute settlement law,\n\nagree on it.\n\nand (iii) manpower development law.\n\n\f14\n\ndownsized  through  voluntary  settlement  of  employment  termination.  Among  these,  Indonesia\nAerospace  Industries  (IPTN)  laid  off  3,780  workers  and  Garuda  Indonesia  laid  off  1,600.  The\nlabor rationalization took place in consultation with employees through elected representatives\nrather  than  union  leaders,  and  the  process  was  completed  with  minimal  labor  disruption.\nEmployees  were  offered  severance  payments  25-40 percent  higher  than  prescribed  in  the\nPresidential Decree No. 3 of 1996. Under the regulation, employees are entitled to mandatory\ncompensation28  including  severance  pay,  service  benefit,  and  other  compensation  on  the\nfollowing scale:\n\nTable 3: Mandatory Severance Compensation\n\nSeverance Pay\n\nLess than 1 year\n1-2 years\n2-3 years\n3-4 years\nMore than 4 years\n\nMonths Pay\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nService Benefit\n\n5-10 years\n10-15 years\n15-20 years\n20-25 years\nmore than 25 years\n\nMonths Pay\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nIn  the  cases  of  (i)  company  closure  and  (ii)  change  of  ownership  with  employees  refusing  to\ncontinue  working,  the  following  mandatory  compensation  applies:  severance  pay  plus  service\nbenefit  plus  other  compensation.  In  the  cases  of  (iii)  mass  termination  caused  by  efficiency\nmeasures  and  other  non-worker  related  reasons,  and  (iv) change  of  ownership  with  the\ncompany  unwilling  to  reemploy  the  employees,  the  following  compensation  is  mandatory,  two\ntimes  severance  pay  plus  service  benefit  plus  other  compensation.  The  generous  settlements\nbeing offered have been welcomed by employees and their representatives, a large number of\nthem  continue  to  be  concerned  about  their  employment  prospects  under  the  reform  program.\nThe anxiety about employment prospects is particularly strong among contract laborers, who do\nnot  enjoy  the  same  protection  as  regular  workers.  While  there  are  examples  of  amicable\nresolution  of  labor  retrenchment  issues,  there  is  no  certainty  about  the  application  of  these\npractices in future cases, or these practices are not generally known. This is to be dealt with by\nMSOE  through  strengthening  public  relations  and  establishment  of  a  consultative  process  to\nimprove information dissemination.\n\n5. \n\nCorruption, Collusion, and Nepotism (KKN)\n\n44.\nKKN  is  attributable  to  lack  of  transparency,  availability  of  privileges  linked  to\nconnections, and inadequate action against malpractices. In December 1998, the Government\ndisclosed that financial losses arising from KKN across ministries during the past 32 years had\nexceeded  Rp2.9 trillion  ($0.4-1.0  billion,  depending  on  the  exchange  rate  used).  In  July  1999,\nthe Government disclosed an additional Rp7.2 trillion of financial losses due to KKN in ministries\nand SOEs. After investigation, the Government in 1999 ordered the cancellation of 79 projects,\nrebidding  of  25 projects,  reauditing  of  59  projects,  and  renegotiation  of  10  projects.  In  view  of\nrising  public  pressure,  the  Government  has  carried  out  special  audits  for  Pertamina,  Bulog,\nPLN,  and  the  Reforestation  Fund,  and  made  their  main  findings  public.  KKN  in  SOEs  is\nconcentrated in procurement. This area was a key focus in the last round of special enterprise\naudits  conducted  by  international  auditors  and  completed  in  June  2000  but  not  yet  published.\nSelected  enterprises  include  the  national  airline,  the  national  toll  road  operator,  the  domestic\ntelecommunications company, public port corporations, and major plantation companies.\n\n                                                          \n28 The category other compensation includes compensation includes compensation for remaining annual leave and\nlong  service  leave,  compensation  for  repatriation,  compensation  for  medical  insurance,  and  compensation  for\nhousing facilities. They are determined on a base by case basis.\n\n\f15\n\n45.\nAt  a  more  general  level  of  governance,  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  corruption\ninvolve  (i)  improving  access  to  markets,  (ii)  legal  reform,  and  (iii)  strengthening  public\nadministration.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in  developing  its  governance  and\nanticorruption  strategy.29  A  high-level  policy  seminar  was  held  in  Jakarta  in  July  1999  under\nADB  sponsorship  to  raise  stakeholder  awareness  on  this  issue.  An  anticorruption  law  was\nenacted  in  April  1999  providing  disclosure  standards  for  public  employees  and  mandating  the\nestablishment of an independent anticorruption body within two years. An additional antibribery\nlaw was passed by Parliament in July 1999 mandating criminal sanctions for corruption. Since\nearly  2000  ADB  has  been  cooperating  with  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\n(UNDP),  World  Bank,  and  the  Government  in  a  \u201cPartnership  for  Governance,\u201d  which  puts  a\nstrong emphasis on supporting the Government\u2019s fight against corruption.\n\nC. \n\nGovernment Expenditure\n\n46.\nDuring the 1990s, SOEs were unable to generate sufficient profit to finance expansion.\nConsequently, they ended up borrowing excessively or establishing joint ventures. Many SOEs\nbecame  high-cost  producers  of  products  and  services  as  they,  under  political  pressure,\nparticipated  in  nonviable  ventures  or  served  the  Government's  social  and  employment  goals.\nFor example, many SOEs were forced to take shareholding in toll road projects designed by the\nnational toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga. Similarly, many SOEs ended up with shareholding in\nthe national aircraft manufacturer PT IPTN, and were forced to carry the burden of successive\ncapital restructurings. SOE performance was affected by lack of clarity about objectives, weak\nincentive  structures,  and  soft  budget  constraints  that  enabled  financing  of  their  losses  and\ncapital outlay. While quantification of the level of transfers and subsidies from the Government\nbudget is difficult, a World Bank study30 for 22 SOEs suggests that equity contributions and loan\nforgiveness  amounted  to  $1.5  billion  (Rp3.0  trillion),  and  price  support  to  $1.8  billion  (Rp3.5\ntrillion),  compared  to  dividends  of  $420  million  (Rp854 billion)  in  1996.  Given  ineffective\ngovernance  mechanisms,  SOEs \nlargely  operated  without  proper  accountability  and\ntransparency  as  well  as  financial  discipline.  Accounting  practices  did  not  allow  reliable\nmonitoring  of  management  and  enterprise  performance,  and  encouraged  widespread\nirregularities, making it difficult to assess the value for the shareholder.\n\nSOEs will continue to burden the budget through the exchange rate risks associated with\n47.\nthe two-step offshore foreign currency loans raised by them during the 1990s. The SOEs repay\nthese  obligations,  including  the  interest  payments,  to  the  Government  in  local  currency  at  the\nexchange  rates  prevailing  on  the  drawdown  dates.  There  are  no  consolidated  records  of  the\nsize and composition of such two-steps foreign currency loans, which are administered by MOF.\nADB  provided  a  TA  to  MOF  to  assess  its  loan  portfolio  and  establish  a  unit  for  its  risk\nmanagement.31 Liabilities of exchange risk coverage on these two-step foreign currency loans\nare huge. Preliminary estimates are about $20 billion. As an example, future obligations of PT\nTelkom\u2019s two-step loans amount to Rp27 trillion, or close to $3 billion at the current exchange\nrate. If PT Telkom had borne the exchange rate risk since 1998, over half of its shareholders\u2019\nfunds and its entire profit would have been wiped out.\n\n                                                          \n29 TA 3381-INO: Establishment of an Anticorruption Commission,  for  $1,000,000,  approved  on  28  December  1999.\nTA 3474-INO: A Governance Audit of the Public Prosecution Service, for $1,000,000, approved on 21 July 2000.\n30 World Bank, 1998.

The  first  phase  of\nprivatization implemented between October 1994 and December 1996 preceded the economic\ncrisis.  It  involved  the  sale  of  minority  stakes,  ranging  from  10  percent  to  35 percent,  in  six  of\nIndonesia\u2019s  largest  SOEs  on  domestic  and  international  capital  markets.32  The  divestment\nraised  close  to  $4.3  billion.  MOF  held  the  nominal  ownership  of  SOEs  and,  in  principle,  was\nsupposed  to  exercise  its  control  rights  by  setting  up  specific  performance  targets  for  SOE\noperations  and  issuing  guidelines  for  dividends.  In  practice,  the  power  of  SOE  management,\nadministration, and supervision rested with the sector ministries. This institutional arrangement\nin  effect  confounded  the  actual  property  rights  over  SOEs  between  MOF  and  the  sector\nministries. The sector ministries frequently interfered in the commercial operations of SOEs and\nexerted considerable power of informal property rights due to personal allegiance, subsidization,\nand outright corruption, cronyism, and nepotism.\n\n49.\nThe second phase of SOE reforms, induced by the crisis, started in early 1998 when the\nGovernment  changed  the  institutional  arrangement  for  the  oversight  of  SOEs.  As  a  first  step,\nPresidential  Decree  Nos.  12  and  13 of  1998  transferred  the  power  of  SOE  management,\nadministration,  and  supervision  from  the  sector  ministries  back  to  MOF.  SOEs  were  delinked\nfrom  the  purview  of  sector  ministries  to  remove  the  latter\u2019s  interference  in  SOEs\u2019  commercial\noperations  and  refocus  sector  ministries  to  their  primary  function  of  sector  policy  making  and\nregulation. In the third phase, in May 1998, Presidential Decrees Nos. 50 and 64 were issued to\ntransfer the management responsibility of SOEs from MOF to the newly established MSOE, with\na  view  to  providing  them  with  increased  managerial  autonomy.  In  December  1999,  4  state-\nowned  banks  and  14  financial  institutions  were  transferred  from  MSOE  back  to  the  MOF.  To\nimprove  Cabinet  efficiency,  MSOE  was  dissolved  on  26  August  2000,  and  oversight  over  the\nSOEs was transferred to a directorate general for SOEs (DG BUMN) in MOF.33 On 10 August\n2001, MSOE was reinstated by President Megawati Sukarnoputri as a state ministry.\n\n50.\nThese changes have streamlined institutional arrangements for SOEs. MOF continues to\noversee the financial aspects of SOEs, including share custody, financial audits, and receipt of\ndividends and revenues from the sale of shares. All other property rights are now exercised by\nMSOE:  (i)  dividend  payments;  (ii)  appointment  and  termination  of  contracts  of  SOE\ncommissioners  and  directors;  (iii)  merger,  consolidation,  sale,  and  liquidation  of  SOEs;  and\n(iv) granting  of  Government  guarantees  for  SOE  debt.  However,  the  process  of  SOE\nrestructuring  and  privatization  will  continue  to  require  close  interdepartmental  coordination\nbetween MSOE and the sector ministries, particularly in PSO-related matters. The Government\nhas therefore established the minister-level Privatization Consultative Committee to coordinate\nthe reform process.\n\nE. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n51.\nSince the onset of the economic crisis, donors have coordinated closely in Indonesia to\noversee the implementation of the macroeconomic stabilization program and structural reforms\nacross  critical  sectors.  Responding  to  the  crisis,  ADB  approved  the  FGR:SDP  (footnote  1)  to\nhelp strengthen financial sector policies and regulatory framework, restructure and recapitalize\nbanks, and initiate a number of reforms of SOEs. In early 1999, ADB approved a program loan\n\n                                                          \n32 PT  Telkom,  PT  Indosat,  PT  Semen  Gresik,  PT  Tambang  Timah,  PT  Amka  Tambang,  and  PT  Bank  Negara\n\nIndonesia.\n\n33 Refer to Presidential Decree No. 89 of 10 October 2000.\n\n\f17\n\nfor  the  power  sector34  to  help  split  up  a  major  SOE,  PLN,  and  privatize  commercially  viable\ncomponents. The program supports the Government\u2019s reform agenda and involves dismantling\nthe  vertical  monopoly  in  the  power  sector  to  increase  private  sector  participation  and  to  move\ntoward competitive markets for generation and distribution of electricity, with a single company\nresponsible for national transmission.\n\n52. With the financial and power sector restructuring under way, ADB has been coordinating\nwith other funding agencies, including IMF, to support revival of the real sector. The World Bank\nfinanced  the  preparation  of  a  first  SOE  masterplan  in  1999  and  provided  a  loan35  that  has\nsupported restructuring and partial privatization of a first group of 12 of the largest SOEs. While\nincluding  selective  policy  measures  for  the  SOE  sector,  the  World  Bank  loan  was  primarily  a\nbroad-based  structural  adjustment  operation  that  covered  improvements  in  macroeconomic\nmanagement, legal and regulatory framework for bank and corporate restructuring, governance,\ntransparency,  efficiency,  and  social  safety  net  for  the  poor  across  several  sectors.  Apart  from\nthis  World  Bank  contribution,  ADB  is  the  only  institution  to  provide  support  for  structural\nadjustments in the difficult SOE sector.\n\n53. \nADB approved a TA in December 1998 (footnote 5) to develop governance structures for\nSOEs,  implement  a  strategic  planning  system  in  MSOE,  design  privatization  and  restructuring\nprocedures,  assess  the  legal  framework  for  privatization,  and  prepare  corporate  restructuring\nand  privatization  plans  for  a  group  of  40  SOEs.  As  a  lead  funding  agency  in  corporate\ngovernance,  apart  from  helping  formulate  overall  structural  reforms  to  introduce  higher\nstandards of corporate governance among SOEs, ADB has been supporting specific efforts in\nthe  power  sector  (para.  51),  gas  transmission  industry,  insurance,  and  pension  funds.\nMeanwhile,  the  World  Bank  has  been  helping  to  open  the  telecommunications  industry  to  the\nprivate sector and improve efficiency in the postal monopoly.\n\nDuring processing,36 ADB has closely coordinated with the IMF, whose LOI of 27 August\n54.\n2001  reconfirms  the  major  elements  of  the  proposed  Program  and  includes  provisions  for\nmonitoring the progress in privatizing SOEs by setting targets for proceeds from their sale. ADB\nalso has an ongoing dialogue with Japanese authorities and has kept them informed about the\nprogress of the Program.\n\nF. \n\nADB's Operations and Strategy in Indonesia\n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy\n\n55.\nADB\u2019s new country operational strategy (2001-2004) for Indonesia, which was finalized\nin early 2001, focuses principally on reducing poverty and regional inequity, and is anchored in\ngood governance as the strategy recognizes its crucial importance in the Indonesian context.\nThe  strategy  has  four  principal  areas  of  operational  focus  where  assistance  will  have  to  be\n\n                                                          \n34 Loan  1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program,  for  $380  million,  approved  on  23  March  1999;  and  Loan\n1674-INO: Capacity Building for Establishment of a Competitive Electricity Market,  for  $20  million,  approved  on\n23 March 1999.\n\n35 Policy Reform Support Program for $500 million, approved in May 1999.\n36 Processing of the proposed Program was suspended between August and December 1999, along similar action of\nIMF  and  the  World  Bank,  due  to  the  Bank  Bali  scandal  and  political  uncertainty  during  the  transition  to  a\ndemocratically  elected  government.  All  three  institutions  resumed  operations  in  late  1999.  IMF  agreed  on  a  new\nLOI  in  January  2000,  covering  a  new  three-year  extended  arrangement  until  December  2002.  The  previous\nextended  arrangement  from  late  1997  was  terminated.  Only  $10  billion  out  of  $12  billion  was  used.  The  new\narrangement  is  for  almost  $5  billion,  an  enhancement  of  around  $3  billion  over  the  pervious  arrangement.\nProcessing  of  the  proposed  Program  was  again  suspended  between  May  2000  and  September  2001  due  to\npolitical uncertainty.\n\n\f18\n\nprogrammed: encouraging sustainable recovery and pro-poor growth, improving regional equity\nthrough  balanced  regional  development,  enhancing  human  and  social  development,  and\nmainstreaming environmental management to ensure sustainable use of natural resources.\n\n56.\nIn view of the governance-related issues in the financial and corporate sectors that had\ncontributed  to  the  financial  crisis,  support  for  improving  financial  and  corporate  governance  in\norder to build up a more stable and resilient financial and corporate structure is a major element\nof  the  governance  strategy  for  Indonesia.  In  the  area  of  corporate  governance,  reform  of  the\nSOEs, which contribute a significant share to the overall GDP, is critical. The crisis had exposed\nserious weaknesses in the functioning of SOEs, much of it governance related; thus, improving\ntheir functioning and privatizing them is a priority.\n\n57.\nThe poor performance of SOEs is also a major factor contributing to the fiscal weakness\nof  the  public  sector  and  impeding  economic  recovery  in  general.  Improving  their  performance\nand assisting their privatization is thus also consistent with the focus in the country operational\nstrategy on encouraging sustainable recovery. The program of SOE privatization is also a key\nelement  of  the  Government\u2019s  structural  adjustment  program  supported  by  IMF\u2019s  current  $5\nbillion three year extended fund facility. On 27 August 2001, the new Government signed an LOI\nwith  IMF  that  allowed  a  release  of  a  $400  million  tranche  from  the  Facility.  This  tranche  had\nbeen  delayed  since  December  2000  owing  to  lack  of  progress  on  reforms  and  its  release\nsignals that the IMF reform program is back on track.\n\n2. \n\nSector Strategy\n\nADB's  operational  strategy  for  SOEs  supports  fostering  competition  and  establishing  a\n58.\ntransparent  and  predictable  policy  regime  across  the  trade,  industry,  and  financial  sectors.\nOverleveraging and exposure to unhedged foreign currency liabilities have resulted in a severe\nfinancial  crisis.  With  extensive  support  from  external  funding  agencies,  including  ADB,  the\nGovernment  has  moved  to  strengthen  financial  sector  governance  standards,  restructure  the\nsector,  and  improve  its  viability  through  consolidation  and  recapitalization.  In  addition,  ADB  is\nhelping,  with  a  recent  program  (footnote  3),  to  streamline  and  rationalize  the  industrial  policy\nand  regulatory  framework  so  that  both  public  and  private  enterprises,  particularly  small-  and\nmedium-sized  enterprises,  develop  in  an  open  and  competitive  environment  to  support  higher\nand sustainable economic growth.\n\n59. While  industrial  deregulation  and  liberalization  is  in  progress,  the  SOE  sector,  which  is\nan important segment of the economy, needs a program focused at comprehensive corporate\nrestructuring. ADB assistance in the first phase has involved targeting SOE reforms as a part of\nthe FGR:SDP. This program has focused on (i) enactment of anticorruption legislation; (ii) study\nof private provision of public services, their pricing, costs, and benefits; (iii) performance audit by\nthe  Finance  and  Development  Supervisory  Board  (BPKP)  of  selected  SOEs  and  special  state\nagencies,  and  capacity-building  programs  to  raise  the  quality  of  public  sector  auditors  and\ninspector generals of ministries; and (iv) issuance of regulations requiring increased disclosure\nin  audited  financial  statements  of  SOEs  and  a  decree  on  the  mandatory  publication  of  SOE\naudit reports. Progress has been made in all these areas, but delays have been experienced in\nsome policy actions because of changes in institutional arrangements.\n\n60.\nIn  December  1998,  ADB  sponsored  a  substantial  study  on  corporate  governance  in\nIndonesia  (footnote  5).  The  study  revealed  major  weaknesses  of  the  precrisis  corporate\ngovernance  regime  and  highlighted  improvements  achieved  in  1998.  While  the  legislative\nframework  for  corporate  governance  is  mostly  in  place,  compliance  and  enforcement  are  the\nmajor  concerns.  ADB's  strategy  is  to  support  strengthening  of  corporate  governance  in  key\n\n\f19\n\nsegments  of  the  economy.  Just  as  the  FGR:SDP  has  improved  governance  in  the  financial\nsector, the proposed Program will establish improved governance practices in the SOE sector\nby enforcing rules and regulations and addressing special agency problems through contractual\narrangements.  In  the  process,  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  improving\ngovernance standards in private companies will also be strengthened by transferring experience\ngained under the Program. ADB, along with other agencies, is supporting NCCG (footnote 4) to\nbetter  define  its  role  and  functions  and  to  help  encourage  development  of  structures  and\nmechanism to improve corporate governance in the private sector.\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\nThough  established  to  serve  both  economic  and  social  goals,  SOEs  have  been  an\n61.\ninefficient  supplier  of  both  public  and  private  services  and  goods.  The  provision  of  social\nservices  and  contribution  to  regional  development  objectives  have  largely  been  achieved  at\na considerable cost to society. Inefficiencies arose because of indiscriminate subsidization and\nprotection  of  SOEs  without  due  regard  for  economic  viability  and  competitiveness.  Moreover,\nSOEs have been exploited for the benefit of individuals and associated interests, accompanied\nby  growing  corruption  and  collusion  or  outright  fraud.  This  neglect  of  governance  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s sphere of direct influence has encouraged lax governance in the private sector,\nto the detriment of creditors and minority shareholders.\n\n62.\n\nSOE performance in Indonesia has been affected by:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nweak  corporate  governance  such  as  Government  interference,  poor  internal\ncontrols,  loopholes  in  accounting  practices,  and  weak  auditing  standards  and\npractices;\nlax  supervision  and  insufficient  accountability  that  have  distorted  performance\nincentives for supervisors and staff;\nweak enforcement of commercial laws and regulations;\nill-conceived market protection and administered price controls; and\nineffective SOE management.\n\n63.\nThe SOE reliance on two-step foreign currency loans that they received in local currency\nhas  significant  long-term  budgetary  implications  (see  para.  47).  Under  the  standard  onlending\narrangements, the Government carries the full exchange rate risk on both interest and principal\nfor SOEs\u2019 borrowings. Preliminary estimates suggest that in the next 10 years these costs will\namount  to  over  $20  billion,  possibly  higher  than  the  total  sale  value  of  SOEs.  The  persistent\nsubsidization of SOEs\u2019 products and services, their excessive reliance on government funding,\nand their wasteful spending because of lack of accountability have added to the financial burden\nof  SOEs.  Furthermore,  SOEs\u2019  inefficiencies  have  held  back  growth  of  quality  service.  For\nexample, PT Telkom is unable to expand its infrastructure to cater for increasing demand. Given\nits  restricted  access  to  equity,  it  cannot  pursue  investment  opportunities,  even  if  substantially\nleveraged. PT Telkom\u2019s investment in a number of leveraged joint ventures has constrained its\nfurther  growth.  Similarly,  PT  Jasa  Marga  launched  a  number  of  leveraged  joint  venture  build-\nown-transfer toll road projects that are now in serious financial difficulty.\n\nOverall, the costs of holding on to the portfolio of SOEs are significant: (i) the opportunity\n64.\ncost  of  capital  invested  in  SOEs  (see  footnote  17)  amounted  to  $3.7  billion  (Rp37  trillion)  in\n2000  (Rp23  trillion  is  attributable  to  the  national  electric  company  PT  PLN  alone).  These  will\ndecline to about $2.5 billion (Rp25 trillion) in 2002, and are expected to remain at that level in\n\n\f20\n\nthe  foreseeable  future;  (ii)  the  past  practice  of  exchange  rate  risk  being  borne  by  the\nGovernment under two-step loans will burden the state budget with at least $1.1 billion (Rp11\ntrillion) per year during the next decade; and (iii) the direct costs of delayed interest payments\nfor  loans  from  MOF  to  individual  SOEs  is  estimated  to  amount  to  $300  million  (Rp3  trillion)\nannually. The aggregate cost of (i), (ii), and (iii) is $3.9 billion (Rp39 trillion), equivalent to four\ntimes  the  expenditure  for  housing  and  human  settlement,  five  times  the  expenditure  for\neducation, and eight times the health expenditure. It does not yet include future debt-to-equity\nswaps,  loan  foregiveness  in  the  context  of  IBRA  debt  restructurings,  and  losses  from  SOE\nliquidations, which may occur in any year.\n\n65.\nDespite protection, subsidies, and guaranteed access to foreign lending, investments in\nSOEs  have  yielded  poor  returns.  The  rupiah  depreciation  did  improve  the  financial  position  of\nSOEs  only  marginally  due  to  increases  in  debt  servicing  costs,  a  drop  in  domestic  demand,\nincreases  in  the  cost  of  imported  raw  materials,  and  tightening  of  credit  availability.  The\neconomic crisis also severely affected the profitability of most SOEs and wiped out their equity.\nWhile subsidization of SOEs has been scaled down due to fiscal pressures, many SOEs have\nraised additional debt or stopped servicing their debt obligations to cover operational losses and\nmeet day-to-day obligations. This avoids tough decisions in the near-term, but raises the long-\nterm cost of SOE reform considerably and complicates the process of debt resolution, which is\ncritical to maintain momentum of the banking sector reforms.\n\n66.\nThe  growing  distress  of  SOEs  and  the  need  to  address  fundamental  structural\ndistortions of the economy exposed during the economic crisis have brought to the forefront the\nurgency  of  SOE  reforms.  The  Program  focuses  on  strengthening  SOE  governance  with  the\nobjective  of  their  restructuring  and  eventual  privatization.  The  Government  has  started  to\nenforce  higher  corporate  governance  standards  in  the  commercial  enterprises  under  its  direct\ncontrol,  while  reforming  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  inducing  greater\ncompetition  and  market  orientation  across  sectors.  This  holistic  approach  to  corporate\ngovernance  will  also  help  introduce  and  enforce  best  corporate  governance  practices  in  the\nprivate  economy  and  provide  the  incentives  for  sound  investments.  It  will  also  improve\nprospects  for  the  privatization  of  profitable  SOEs  and  support  restructuring  of  ailing  SOEs,\nthereby  reducing  the  financial  risk  in  the  Government\u2019s  SOE  portfolio.  Sole  emphasis  on\ncorporate restructuring or privatization of SOEs without improvements in corporate governance\nis  not  feasible,  as  the  restructured  or  privatized  enterprises  are  not  likely  to  reach  sustainable\nprofitability  or  attract  domestic  and  foreign  investors.  Improved  profitability  in  the  state  sector\nand corporate restructuring of SOEs will reinforce the ongoing bank sector restructuring.\n\n67.\nRecognizing this, the Government has adopted privatization of SOEs as a key strategy\nto  enhance  economic  liberalization  and  generate  revenues  for  debt  repayments  and  bank\nrecapitalization.  However,  poor  planning,  weak  public  relations,  and  opposition  from  vested\npolitical  and  bureaucratic  interests  have  delayed  the  privatization  process.  MSOE,  established\nin 1998, took some time to develop its own capacity and a final and comprehensive masterplan\nfor  the  SOE  reforms  was  only  announced  in  June  2000.  To  support  this  masterplan,  the\nProgram  aims  to  introduce  corporate  governance  mechanisms  that  align  management\nincentives  with  shareholder  objectives  and  interests,  separate  PSOs  from  commercial\noperations of SOEs, and enforce SOEs\u2019 compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. These\nmeasures will facilitate financial and operational restructuring of viable SOEs and liquidation of\nnonviable  ones,  while  generating  momentum  for  privatization  of  commercially  successful\nenterprises.  To  support  this  process,  the  Program  also  calls  for  adopting  a  human  resource\ndevelopment  policy  guaranteeing  fair  treatment  of  redundant  employees,  thereby  accelerating\nlabor  restructuring  and  eliminating  or  reducing  opportunities  for  KKN,  particularly  in  the\nprocurement process.\n\n\fB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n21\n\n68.\nThe  proposed  Program  will  improve  resource  allocation  in  the  public  sector,  increase\nprofitability  of  Indonesia\u2019s  SOEs,  and  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  commercial\nactivities  of  SOEs.  Reform  of  SOEs,  involving  transfer  of  ownership  and  management,  and\nconfining the Government\u2019s role to policymaking and regulation, will release scarce resources\nfor poverty reduction and social programs. This will be achieved by\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nsubjecting SOEs to sound corporate governance practices;\nseparating commercial activities of SOEs from their PSOs;\nrestructuring and privatizing SOEs;\nestablishing  fair  and  transparent  procedures  for  managing  labor  redundancies;\nand\nstrengthening and effectively enforcing guidelines for procurement in SOEs.\n\n69.\nThe  proposed  Program  will  concentrate  on  restructuring  of  SOEs  incorporated  as\ncompanies with limited liability (perseros) under the authority of MSOE. It excludes banks and\nfinancial  institutions  that  are  being  restructured  under  the  FGR:SDP  and  other  programs,  and\nutilities  such  as  the  electricity  supplier  (PT  PLN),  natural  gas  transmitter  (PT  PGN),  postal\nmonopoly (PT Pos), and toll road operator (PT Jasa Marga) that are supported under separate\nADB or World Bank loans and TAs.\n\nThe proposed Program will be implemented over the next three years, targeting reforms\n\n70.\nin selected subsets of the SOE portfolio held by MSOE (for details, see Appendix 3) by\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nintroducing the new corporate governance standards and practices in 88 SOEs\nthat are not to be privatized in the next 3 years,\ncommercializing  PSOs  in  selected  SOEs  where  such  obligations  have  been\nidentified,\nrestructuring  the  finances  and  operations  of  30  SOEs  that  are  suitable\ncandidates for rapid improvement and subsequent divestment,\nprivatizing  15  SOEs  where  access  to  equity  capital  and/or  management\nexpertise will improve prospects for profitability,\nselling the minority shareholding in 12 companies,\nliquidating 8 unviable SOEs,\napplying the labor retrenchment policy  to all SOEs, and\nauditing procurement and procurement practices in 40 randomly selected SOEs.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\nThe  policy  framework  and  actions  that  have  been  agreed  with  the  Government  are\n71.\ndescribed in detail in the development policy letter and the attached policy matrix (Appendix 1).\nThe major actions are outlined here.\n\n1. \n\nCorporate Governance\n\n72.\nThe  introduction  of  sound  corporate  governance  standards  and  practices  involves\nsetting  in  place  a  set  of  structures,  procedures,  and  incentives,  that  empower  managers  to\ncreate  shareholder  value  under  adequate  supervision,  in  a  transparent  environment,  and  with\nadequate accountability. This includes contractual arrangements to improve accountability and\ntransparency,  as  well  as  enforcement  of  commercial  laws,  standards,  and  regulations.\nformalized  contractual\nAccountability  will  be  established \n\nthrough  standardized  and \n\n\f22\n\narrangements, which involve the Government agreeing on statements of corporate intent (SCIs)\nand  entering  into  appointment  agreements  with  commissioners  and  directors  of  SOEs.  For\nSOEs listed on JSE, the Program prescribes the rigorous application of JSE listing rules (para.\n77) thereby giving priority to the protection of minority shareholders.\n\nThe Program calls  for the implementation of SCIs for at least 88 SOEs. Going beyond\n73.\nthe  financial  and  corporate  information  required  in  the  annual  report  of  a  listed  company,  the\nSCI provides specific and strategic directions to the BOD. The SCI defines the (i) objectives and\nscope  of  SOE  activities;  (ii) business  and  corporate  restructuring  plan  and  an  assessment  of\ncost  and  savings;  (iii) accounting  policies;  (iv) performance  targets  in  relation  to  prescribed\nobjectives;  (v) information  requirements  of  the  shareholding  ministry;  (vi)  compliance  with\nenvironmental legislation to be confirmed through certification by accredited agency (e.g., ISO\n14000);  (vii) employment  status  of  staff  and  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  regarding\nlabor relations; (viii) procedures to be followed for acquisition or sale of shares and divestment\nof  subsidiaries;  (ix) compensation  for  SOE  activities  from  the  public  sector,  if  any;  and\n(x) procedures  for  financial  valuation  of  SOEs.  SCIs  will  help  alleviate  the  problem  associated\nwith management expanding or reducing SOE activities without the appropriate mandate.\n\n74.\nIn  conjunction  with  SCIs,  the  Government  as  shareholder  will  enter  into  formal\nappointment  agreements  with  all  newly  appointed  commissioners  and  directors.  These\ncontractual arrangements can be documented in the minutes of the shareholder meeting. The\nGovernment has announced the appointment criteria, roles, responsibilities, and accountability\nof  BOCs  and  BODs.37  The  appointment  agreements  will  foster  autonomy  of  SOEs  and\naccountability  of  supervisors  and  management  by  establishing  individual  and  collective  roles\nand  responsibilities  for  implementing  the  SCI.  In  addition,  MSOE  will  review  and  comment  on\nthe composition of the BOCs and BODs, including the number of members, and their skills mix\nand  qualifications.38  A  new  performance  incentive  system  will  be  introduced  for  all  SOEs  to\nreward management and staff for improvements in defined performance indicators.\n\n75.      For a rigorous system of accountability to work, MSOE officials and SOE commissioners\nand directors must be highly qualified professionals. Therefore, with ADB support (footnote 5),\ntraining  has  been  provided,  in  effective  corporate  governance  mechanisms  and  will  continue\nunder a new TA (footnote 6). So far, 60 officials and SOE management and staff have received\nthis training and another 120 will be trained by 2002. MSOE will review the performance of the\nfirst  group  of  SOEs  that  have  received  the  training  and  implemented  SCIs  and  appointment\nagreements for at least one year.\n\n76.\nIn  addition  to  establishing  clear  accountability,  the  Program  will  radically  improve\ntransparency  and  disclosure  of  financial  accounts  of  SOEs.  Corporate  secretaries  will  be\nresponsible  for  providing  mandated  corporate  information  to  the  public.  The  Government  will\nenforce  strict  application  of  accounting  standards  by  SOEs  in  accordance  with  an  agreed\ntimetable. A total of 78 SOEs will be subjected to independent (non-BPKP) three-year financial\naudits.  In  addition,  it  will  encourage  rigorous  application  and  enforcement  of  disclosure\nstandards  recently  prescribed  by  the  Government.  Sound  disclosure  standards,  uniform\napplication of Indonesian GAAP for the preparation of annual reports under the supervision of\naudit  committees  at  the  BOC  level,  and  submission  of  such  reports  in  accordance  with  legal\nrequirements will enhance transparency and improve governance.\n\n                                                          \n37 Decree of the Minister of Finance No. 146/KMK.05/2001\n38 The review will include the role, obligations and composition of BOC and BOD to verify whether BOC has guided\nand monitored the implementation by BOD of (i) SOE\u2019s long-term plan, (ii) annual business plan, and (iii) budget.\n\n\f23\n\n77.\nThe  Program  recognizes  the  important  role  of  listed  SOEs  for  improving  the  quality  of\ncorporate  governance  in  Indonesia\u2019s  private  sector.  MSOE  will  ensure  that  listed  SOEs  will\nmove  to  comply  with  the  listing  rules  of  JSE,  in  particular  with  the  following  provisions  on\ncorporate governance:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nappointment  of  independent  commissioners  in  proportion  to  the  number  of\nshares held by noncontrolling shareholders;\nestablishment of an audit committee comprising at least three members, one of\nwhom is an independent commissioner and the others independent professionals\nin accounting and/or finance recruited from outside the company; and\nappointment  of  a  corporate  secretary,  who  must  be  a  member  of  the  BOD  or  a\ncorporate officer specifically appointed to this function.\n\n2. \n\nPublic Service Obligations\n\n78.\nThe Program supports the separation of PSOs from the purely commercial activities of\nSOEs. To this end, MSOE will (i) identify PSOs in all SOEs; (ii) quantify the monetary value of\nperforming  PSOs  in  15  SOEs;  (iii)  develop  rules  and  regulations  for  contracting  such  services\non  a  competitive  bidding  basis,  allowing  participation  by  private  companies;  and  (iv)\ncommercialize PSOs in selected SOEs. The objective is to establish a transparent process for\nthe separation of PSOs with due consultation of all stakeholders. A precondition for carrying out\n(ii) is the introduction of cost accounting in the concerned SOEs. This helps to quantify the costs\nof providing PSOs, and will allow to estimate the value of the commercial operations of SOEs,\nthus facilitating the privatization process.\n\n79.\nMSOE will cooperate closely with relevant sector ministries to introduce these rules and\nregulations,  and  support  the  contracting  out  of  selected  PSOs  to  the  most  competitive  bidder,\nwhich  may  not  necessarily  be  the  SOE  that  had  previously  been  providing  the  services.  The\ncontracting  process  will  give  due  consideration  to  compliance  with  social  and  environmental\nlegislation in technical specifications. ADB is supporting these reforms with TA (footnote 7).\n\n80.\nInternational  experience  has  demonstrated  that  PSOs  can  be  most  efficiently  provided\nwhen a competitive environment exists. This requires quantification and packaging of PSOs as\nconcessions  or  service  contracts  and  offering  them  in  public  tender  to  the  most  competitive\nbidder. Such a contracting process will allow the Government to accurately measure the cost of\nPSOs  and  ensure  that  their  provision  is  contracted  to  the  most  efficient  supplier.  This  will\nfacilitate  the  creation  of  a  transparent  system  of  (i)  subsidies  for  socially  desirable,  but\neconomically nonviable services whose cost can be fully quantified and financed explicitly from\nthe Government budget; and (ii) bidding for the provision of such services by private companies\nthrough predefined and transparent rules and procedures.\n\n81.\nThe  Government  has  identified  15  SOEs  with  significant  PSOs.  Among  them  are\nIndonesia\u2019s ports, which are operated by four SOEs, each of which has one potentially profitable\nport combined with 8 to 15 smaller regional ports that operate with losses. Similarly, all airports\nare operated by either of two SOEs, with one profitable international airport each (Jakarta and\nDenpasar) and several loss-making regional airports. Privatization options for these 6 SOEs are\nto sell them entirely, which involves the risk that the new owners might close the losing regional\noperations later, with unacceptable political and socioeconomic consequences. Another option,\ncurrently  pursued  by  the  Government  for  the  airports  and  already  applied  to  the  container\nterminals of the Jakarta and Surabaya seaports, is to separate the profitable operations from the\nSOE and sell them to private operators or form joint ventures with private investors to operate\nthem separately. This option has the risk that the SOEs will no longer generate sufficient profits\n\n\f24\n\nto cross-subsidize the loss making ports and airports. A third possibility, to be pursued under the\nproposed Program, is to separate the non-profitable operations, which are in most cases PSOs,\nfrom  the  commercial  operations,  and  find  alternative  delivery  systems  for  them,  including\ntransparent subsidization. The commercial operations can thus be sold without endangering the\nfuture provision of PSOs.\n\n3.\n\nCorporate Restructuring and Privatization\n\n82.\nGiven the size and complexity of SOE restructuring, the Program, together with the ADB\nfinanced TA (footnote 6) applies a common analytical framework39 that (i) prescribes guidelines\nfor  assessing  the  financial  and  commercial  viability  of  SOEs,  (ii) develops  a  financial  and\noperational  restructuring  strategy  for  SOEs  with  feasible  options  for  privatization,  and  (iii)\ndetermines financial and economic costs associated with the restructuring. Based on the work\nalready  undertaken  by  the  Government,  the  Program  calls  for  (i)  financial  and  operational\nrestructuring of 30 SOEs to prepare them for privatization, (ii) privatization of 15 SOEs, (iii) sale\nof  the  minority  shareholding  in  12  companies,  and  (iv) initiation  of  liquidation  of  8  nonviable\nSOEs.\n\n83.\nIn  contrast  to  this  new  approach,  which  is  based  on  analysis  and  strategy,  the  first\nprivatization  attempts  in  1998  and  1999  were  of  an  ad-hoc  nature,  focusing  predominantly  on\nfiscal  considerations.  The  Government  planned  to  restructure  and  partially  privatize  12  of  the\nlargest  SOEs  in  the  telecommunications,  mining,  cement,  airport  and  seaport,  toll  road,  steel,\nand plantation sectors, and to divest one minority shareholding, PT Indofood, in the first round\nbetween May 1998 and March 2000. Privatization of these large infrastructure SOEs was part of\nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Policy  Reform  Support  Program  (footnote  35).  However,  weak  market\nconditions, \nin\ninfrastructure  sectors,  and  lack  of  experience  prevented  the  Government  from  completing  this\nfirst round by the end of March 2000.\n\ninadequate  regulatory  structures \n\nthe  complexity  of  various \n\nindustries, \n\n84.\nIn  recognition  of  these  difficulties,  the  Government  requested  TA  from  ADB  to  put  the\nprivatization program on a solid basis. With support of consultants under the ADB-financed TA\n(footnote 5), the Government has undertaken substantial analytical and legal background work\nto relaunch its SOE privatization and governance program. In December 1999, MSOE started to\nscreen all 117 SOEs and 21 minority shareholdings. By the end of February 2000, financial and\nbusiness plan reviews were completed for 43 SOEs and 12 minority shareholdings identified as\nprivatization  targets.  Based  on  this  assessment,  the  quantitative  targets  for  the  Program  have\nbeen developed (Appendix 3), and the Government documented its commitment by publishing\nthem in the form of a masterplan for SOE reform.\n\na.\n\nCorporate Restructuring\n\n85.\nThe Program targets the corporate restructuring of at least 10 commercially viable SOEs\nby  September  2002  and  another  15  by  September  2003.  Financial  restructuring  of  SOEs  can\ninvolve  (i)  selling  subsidiaries  and/or  surplus  assets,  (ii)  equity  injection  from  third  parties,  (iii)\nmergers of SOEs, and (iv) debt restructuring. Operational restructuring can involve changes in\n(i)  management  information  systems;  (ii)  production  and  logistics  planning;  (iii)  distribution\nnetwork; (iv) marketing strategy; (v) workforce number and composition; and (vi) organizational\nstructure.  It  can  also  involve  separation  of  PSOs  from  commercial  activities.  The  restructuring\nand eventual privatization of SOEs will be conducted in a transparent manner to attract private\nsector investors who can inject new capital in viable SOEs. MSOE will continue to develop the\n\n                                                          \n39 The analytical framework has been developed under a previous ADB financed TA (footnote 5).\n\n\f25\n\nrestructuring plans with the support of two new TAs (footnotes 6 and 7).  Where possible, the\nSCI  will  contain  a  time-bound  action  plan  and  targets  for  improving  financial  performance  and\nimplementing the  selected restructuring option for the given SOE. As SOEs should be able to\nattract  strategic  investors,  restructuring  will  commence  immediately  to  pave  the  way  for\nprivatization  under  the  Program.  If  appropriate,  MSOE  will  assist  in  improving  their  balance\nsheets  through  debt-equity  swaps  and  similar  measures,  but  will  leave  it  to  the  private  sector\ninvestors to finance new investment to expand or modernize production facilities. In the case of\nboth PT Indofarma and PT Biofarma, the proceeds from the initial public offerings remained with\nthe companies to finance modernization and expansion.\n\n86.\nFinancial restructuring is expected to be facilitated by recently introduced legal reforms\nsuch  as  (i)  removal  of  the  Company  Law  restrictions  on  the  conversion  of  debt  to  equity;  (ii)\nremoval  of  tax  disincentives  for  restructuring,  such  as  the  failure  to  recognize  mergers  as  tax\nneutral  events  and  limits  on  loss  carry-forward  provisions;  and  (iii) simplification  of  procedures\nfor  debt  restructuring  of  MOF,  MOM,  Ministry  of  Justice,  Ministry  for  Industry  and  Trade,  and\nInvestment Coordinating Board.\n\nb.\n\nPrivatization\n\n The Program targets satisfactory progress in the following two areas: (i) privatization40\n87.\nof 7 SOEs by March 2003 and another 8 SOEs by March 2004, and (ii) disposal of the minority\nshareholdings  in  5  companies  by  March  2003  and  a  further  7  companies  by  March  2004.  To\nensure smooth and transparent privatization, MSOE has developed an analytical framework and\nevaluation  methods  for  SOE  privatization  under  ADB-financed  TA  (footnote  5).  MSOE  has\nfurther  reviewed  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  including  the  Tax  Law  and  Land  Law,\nand  prepared  procedures \nIPO,\nemployee/management  buy-out,  strategic  sale,  and  sale  to  an  existing  investor,  as  well  as  for\nliquidation.  Together  these  provide  MSOE  with  a  sound  legal  and  procedural  base  for  SOE\nrestructuring and privatization.\n\nthe  various  privatization  options  such  as \n\nfor \n\n88.\nThe  ADB-financed  TA  (footnote  6)  will  assist  MOF  in  selecting  the  best  privatization\noption  for  the  sale  of  the  selected  SOEs.  The  relative  merits  of  each  option  will  be  weighed\nagainst  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  for  the  transaction,  which  may  include  maximizing\nrevenue;  preserving  employment;  accessing  new  technologies,  markets,  and  know-how;  and\nsecuring investment commitments. In cases where the objective of the Government is to access\nnew technology/know-how and secure investment commitments, sale to a strategic investor will\nbe  the  most  appropriate  privatization  option.  Where  the  Government  seeks  to  maximize\nproceeds and foster the development of the domestic capital market, sale via IPO may be more\neffective. In all cases, the question of labor retrenchment will need to be addressed as a part of\ntransaction  negotiations,  because  any  obligations  imposed  on  the  investor  to  retain  surplus\nlabor will depreciate the transaction value of the company. Once the privatization options have\nbeen defined and assessed for each SOE, MSOE will recommend the best sales strategy and\nan action plan and timetable for its implementation to the steering committee (para. 106). The\nrecommendation  will  be  supported  by  an  assessment  of  its  effectiveness  in  meeting  the\nGovernment\u2019s objectives for the transaction, as well as their financial, economic, and regulatory\nimplications. The implementation itself will be approved and supervised by an evaluation team\nat minister level.\n\n                                                          \n40 Defined as a reduction in the Government\u2019s share in the voting shares of a company (held directly or indirectly) to\n\nless than 50 percent.\n\n\f26\n\nc. \n\nClosure and Liquidation\n\n89.\nUnder  the  Program,  MSOE  will  provide  a  time-bound  plan  and  initiate  liquidation  of  8\nnonviable  SOEs  by  December  2002.  The  decision  to  close  nonviable  SOEs  that  are  not  of\nstrategic significance and had generated operating losses even before the 1997 financial crisis,\nwill be preceded by a thorough review. Generally, closure of SOEs will be considered if they (i)\nuse obsolete technology; (ii) lack competitive advantage; (iii) face declining demand and market\nfor  products;  (iv)  have  weak  management;  (v)  had  already  performed  poorly  before  the  crisis,\nwith the result that their equity has been wiped out; (vi) would require a complete diversification\nand/or overhaul of plant, equipment, marketing strategies and management expertise to return\nto profitability; and (vii) would have a cost of rehabilitation exceeding the value of the potential\nproceeds from their privatization. Liquidation of such SOEs is the most cost efficient option.\n\n4.\n\nLabor Redundancies\n\n90.\nThe restructuring and privatization of SOEs will entail a reduction in staffing, a process\nthat has already begun in some SOEs. According to preliminary estimates under ADB-financed\nTA  (footnote  5),  the  level  of  overstaffing  is  about  10  percent.  In  most  SOEs,  management  is\nreluctant  to  reduce  the  workforce,  particularly  skilled  workers  the  SOE  has  provided  with\nvocational  training.  However,  most  redundancies  will  be  low-skilled  workers.  In  some\nmanufacturing and agricultural SOEs, women could suffer disproportionally.\n\n91.\nThe  impact  of  corporate  restructuring  and  privatization  will  differ  from  SOE  to  SOE.  In\nquite a number of them, new ownership and management will lead to an expansion of activities,\nand the total workforce will increase in the longer term. Examples are the utility companies with\nrestricted  access  to  capital  markets  under  state  ownership,  plantations  that  will  expand  into\nprocessing,  and  companies  in  the  pharmaceutical  and  chemical  industries.  Other  enterprises,\nparticularly  smaller  ones,  may  be  viable  in  the  long  run  only  with  a  permanently  reduced\nworkforce. For some, liquidation will be the only recourse, and retrenched workers will have to\nseek employment elsewhere. The Program puts a strong emphasis on mitigating these negative\nconsequences.  International  experience  shows  that  mass  redundancies  have  to  be  treated\nindividually  and  that  legal  provisions  can  only  serve  as  a  framework  for  negotiations  between\nmanagement and employees or their representatives. The latter have a right to full information\nand fair negotiations, which aim at creative solutions beyond severence payments to ease the\ntransition.  This  is  best  achieved  through  a  process  involving  the  provision  of  information\nfollowed  by  consultations  and  then  negotiations.  Appendix  4  gives  examples  of  recent\nretrenchment settlements and evolving best practices.\n\n92.\nThe  Program  will  support  MSOE\u2019s  efforts  in  developing  a  labor  rationalization  policy  to\nensure fair treatment of redundant SOE employees by using the best practices developed in the\nSOE  sector  and  compliance  with  the  existing  legal  standards  specified  in  Presidential  Decree\n3/1996.  MSOE,  with  assistance  from  ADB-financed  TA  (footnote  6),  will  ensure  that  adequate\ninformation  is  disseminated  to  employees  and  a  structured  process  of  consultation  and\nnegotiation is followed. For this purpose, MSOE will establish a consultative working group on\nlabor  redundancies,  with  representation  from  Government,  SOEs,  and  unions,  to  manage\nseminars and workshops on labor legislation,41 and foster dialogue between labor unions, SOE\nmanagement,  and  MSOE.  The  labor  rationalization  policy  will  cover  (i)  severance  and  service\npayments; (ii) early retirement; (iii) assistance in redeployment, training, or retraining of workers,\nand  financing  of  entrepreneurial  initiatives;  and  (iv)  employee  rights  in  accessing  their  claims\n\n                                                          \n41 Currently there are three new laws before Parliament, the Trade Union Act, Dispute Settlement Act, and Manpower\n\nDevelopment Act.\n\n\f27\n\nagainst  pension  funds.  Within  this  policy  framework,  SOEs  will  submit  their  individual  labor\nrationalization  plans  (including  costs)  to  MOM  for  approval.  MOM  will  maintain  disbursement\nrecords of financial assistance provided by SOEs or by the Government through SOEs unable\nto  meet  the  cost  of  redundancies,  and  will  develop  dispute  procedures  allowing  employees  to\nlodge complaints and initiate litigation where justified.\n\n5.\n\nProcurement\n\n93.\nThe  Program  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  campaign  through  the\napplication  and  enforcement  of  appropriate  rules  and  regulations  in  the  area  of  SOE\nprocurement. It will continue the precedents set by audits of Government business units agreed\nto  under  the  IMF  program.  The  first  set  of  audits  were  conducted  in  the  first  half  of  1999  for\nPertamina, PLN, Agency for National Logistics (BULOG), and the reforestation fund. A second\nseries of audits was started in January 2000 covering the national airline, port companies, the\ntelecommunication company, and others. SOEs\u2019 procurement is guided by Presidential Decree\n18/2000,  which  are  applicable  to  all  public  sector  projects  (and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s\nProcurement Guidelines).  MSOE  will  ensure  that  SOEs  follow  procurement  procedures  as\nprescribed  by  these  public  sector  regulations.  MSOE  will  (i)  require  compliance  of  SOEs  with\ntransparent  and  fair  procurement  practices  ensuring  full  accountability;  (ii)  undertake  random\naudits of procurement in 40 SOEs, present audit reports to ADB, publish a summary of findings,\nand initiate measures to recover losses and prosecute culprits; and (iii) based on the results of\nthe random audits, improve the detailed procedures for the procurement by SOEs, differentiated\nby industry groups if necessary.\n\nD. \n\nEconomic, Social, and Environmental Issues\n\n1. \n\nEconomic Impact\n\nIndonesia  is  pursuing  a  structural  adjustment  program  supported  by  ADB,  IMF,  and\n94.\nWorld  Bank,  which  covers  wide-ranging  economic  reforms \nincluding  banking  sector\nrestructuring,  capital  market  development,  trade  liberalization,  industry  deregulation,  legal\nreform, state sector reform, and improvements in governance. The Program is an integral part\nof  this  overall  reform  agenda  as  it  introduces  and  enforces  sound  corporate  governance\npractices,  improves  the  enforcement  of  commercial  laws  and  regulations,  promotes  fair\ntreatment of redundant employees, reduces corruption in procurement by SOEs, and supports\nthe transformation of viable SOEs into modern and profitable companies.\n\nThe Program will have a profound impact on the overall economy in five areas. First, by\n95.\nsetting  high  standards \nin  corporate  governance,  human  resource  management,  and\nanticorruption  measures,  it  will  create  a  model  to  be  emulated  by  the  private  sector.  Second,\nthrough promoting best practices in debt restructuring, the Program will provide good examples\nfor the private corporate sector as well, and thereby support the work of IBRA and JITF. Third,\ncorporate restructuring of SOEs will result in the development of healthier enterprises, relieving\nthe burden on and risk for public sector finances and the banking sector, which is exposed to\nnonperforming  loans  to  SOEs.  Fourth,  the  proceeds  from  SOE  privatization  will  benefit  the\nbudget,  providing  funds  for  social  projects,  bank  recapitalization,  and  debt  service.  Fifth,  the\nprivatization  of  sound  SOEs  will  attract  foreign  investors  back  to  Indonesia  and  thereby  help\nrestore international confidence.\n\n96.\nThe  economic  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  monitored  and  assessed  on  the  basis  of\n(i) reports  from  SOEs  to  MOM  on  redundancy  agreements  with  employees;  (ii) procurement\naudit reports prepared by independent auditors; (iii) reports from MSOE on compliance with the\n\n\f28\n\ncorporate governance system; (iv) annual reports submitted by listed SOEs to JSE and by the\nother  SOEs  to  MSOE  and  the  Company  Registrar;  (v)  reports  from  MOF  on  the  progress  of\nprivatization; and (vi) reports from the stock exchanges Jakarta and Surabaya on the success of\nIPOs of SOEs.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Impact\n\n97.\nA  detailed  assessment  of  the  Program\u2019s  impact  on  poverty  is  given  in  Appendix  4.  By\nimproving corporate governance and mitigating the impact of labor redundancies, the Program\nsupports  two  key  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy:  good  governance  and  social\ndevelopment.  Moreover,  by  increasing  SOE  efficiency  and  through  privatization,  the  Program\nwill help mobilize additional fiscal resources and thereby facilitate allocation of additional public\nfunds  for  poverty  reduction.  The  Program  addresses  also  the  third  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty\nreduction  strategy:  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth.  SOEs  have  been  a  drain  on  the\nbudget and a drag on economic growth. The inefficiency, corruption, and waste in many SOEs\nhave left the Government with insufficient resources to provide the requisite level and quality of\npublic  services  and  to  launch  antipoverty  programs.  The  Program  will  support  the  transparent\nuse  of  public  funds  and  efficient  delivery  of  public  services.  Their  economic  efficiency  will  be\nincreased  by  applying  a  range  of  tools  including  improved  management,  introduction  of\ncompetitive markets, public-private partnerships, and privatization.\n\n98. While  the  Program  will  facilitate  the  return  to  sustainable  growth,  it  is  likely  to  have  an\nadverse  social  impact,  at  least  in  the  short  run,  as  SOE  restructuring  will  result  in  redundant\nlabor.  The  10  percent  overstaffing  in  the  SOE  sector  represents  about  70,000  employees.\nSurplus labor exists both at the management level where firms have undergone mergers (such\nas in the plantation industry) and at lower levels where changes in technology have reduced the\nneed  for  low  skill  labor  and  necessitate  a  different  skill  mix.  Most  layoffs  are  likely  to  affect\nworkers with low level skills, who will be less likely to find equivalent employment in the formal\nsector. Legally mandated severance standards are adequate. Negotiated settlements tend to be\nin excess of these minimum standards. Compared to the private sector, SOE employees are at\na  disadvantage  in  such  negotiations,  as  prior  to  1999  they  were  not  allowed  to  unionize  or\nengage  in  collective  bargaining.  As  a  result  they  have  little  practical  experience  in  negotiating\ntheir interests with management. And, SOE management has had little experience in dialogue\nwith labor on employment and employment-related issues.\n\n99.\nThe  Program  puts  a  strong  emphasis  on  establishing  a  consultative  working  group  on\nlabor  redundancies  (para.  92)  comprising  representatives  of  all  stakeholders  to  develop  the\nlabor rationalization policy for MSOE. The consultative working group will develop standards of\nbest  practices  in  negotiating  settlements,  serve  as  a  conduit  for  information  for  labor\nrepresentatives,  and  provide  a  forum  for  policy  discussion  regarding  unresolved  labor  issues\nsuch as the treatment of contract labor.42 The Program thus provides a channel for workers and\ntheir  representatives  to  participate  more  fully  and  in  an  informed  way  in  a  dialogue  to  ensure\ntheir  best  interest.  Similarly,  the  corporate  governance  measures  will  result  in  better\nmanagement and fairer treatment of labor and ultimately greater efficiency and returns to public\ninvestment, growth, and poverty reduction.\n\n100.\nThe measures under the Program support strengthening the system for social protection\nin  Indonesia.  ADB,  through  a  TA  (footnote  6),  will  play  a  significant  role  in  assisting  MSOE  to\ndevelop  policies  for  a  retrenchment  process  based  on  best  practices  evolving  within  the  SOE\n                                                          \n42 Public and private sector firms have used contract labor for routine and essential jobs. Labor regulations prohibit\nfirms from using contract labor for this purpose for longer than one year, a rule that is routinely ignored. Moreover,\nsome public sector firms such as the oil and gas industry have been exempt from this by ministerial decree.\n\n\f29\n\nsector  and  internationally.  This  will  help  (i)  ensure  that  workers  receive  an  equitable\ncompensation package, and (ii) resolve issues regarding entitlement to employer contribution to\npension funds, unfunded liabilities, payouts for SOEs with insufficient funds, potential burden on\npension  funds,  and  any  issues  that  may  arise  from  excessive  use  of  contract  labor.  The\nprocesses  adopted  by  SOEs  and  agreements  reached  will  provide  examples  for  the  private\nsector struggling to deal with its own retrenchment programs.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\n101. A  detailed  assessment  of  the  Program\u2019s  potential  environmental  impacts  is  given  in\nAppendix  5.  SOEs  generally  adhere  to  the  Government's  environmental  regulations  in  their\noperations. The three mining companies, for example, have environment protection policies in\nplace,  which  are  rigorously  enforced.  These  policies  have  been  adopted  from  Australian\nstandards,  and  adherence  to  them  is  continuously  monitored.  PT Krakatau  Steel  and  fertilizer\ncompanies  voluntarily  apply  pollution  control  in  line  with  international  best  practices.  The\nmanufacturing  companies  are  generally  certified  under  ISO  9000,  which  encourages  the\napplication  of  environmental  standards  in    production  facilities  and  use  of    efficient  and  clean\nproduction  techniques.  In  some  cases,  SOEs  are  actively  pursuing  environmental  protection\nand  rehabilitation  or  are  required  to  do  so  under  PSOs.  The  fishing  companies,  for  example,\nhave  been  assisting  in  the  protection  of  marine  reserves.  The  forestry  companies  support\nreforestation, forest rehabilitation, and the development of ecotourism opportunities.\n\n102.\nThe  TA  for  commercialization  of  PSOs  (footnote  7)  is  designed  to  ensure  continuing\nprovision  of  such  beneficial  environmental  services  in  a  cost  efficient  manner.  The  rules  and\nregulations  for  contracting  out  such  services  will  give  due  consideration  to  compliance  with\nenvironmental  legislation  in  the  technical  specifications.  The  Program  does  not  envisage\ninvestments  in  additional  production  capacity.  After  privatization,  the  new  owners  may  expand\nproduction,  which  may  widen  the  environmental  impact  of  the  existing  production  sites.\nHowever, any such new investment will have to comply with the existing legislation. During the\nfinancial  and  operational  review  of  the  SOEs,  MSOE,  with  assistance  from  the  ADB-financed\nconsultants, will recommend a special assessment of compliance with environmental legislation\nwhere  appropriate.  Furthermore,  in  any  privatization,  including  environmentally  sensitive\nenterprises,  the  Government  can  retain  the  so-called  golden  share,  which  will  allow  it  to\ninfluence  future  investment  decisions  or  to  enforce  environmental  regulations.  The  major\ninstrument  of  corporate  governance,  the  SCI,  will  require  all  SOEs  to  report  regularly  on\ncompliance  with  environmental  legislation,  and,  where  appropriate,  this  will  have  to  be\nthe\nconfirmed \nperformance incentive system can be used to improve environmental performance by basing it\non environmental indicators or achieving certification by an accredited agency. Finally, the new\nguidelines  for  procurement  to  be  developed  under  the  Program  will  include  requirements  for\ncompliance with environmental standards.\n\nthrough  appropriate  certification  by  an  accredited  agency.  Additionally, \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM LOAN\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\n103. A  $400  million  program  loan  is  proposed  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  to\nsupport  the  Program  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  attached  policy\nmatrix  (Appendix  1).  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Indonesia.  The  loan  will  be  utilized\nover a period of 3 years from the date of its effectiveness. The loan size has been determined\nby the complexity of the Program, its development impact, and the adjustment costs related to\n\n\f30\n\nthe structural reforms. The costs are conservatively estimated at  $800 million during the three-\nyear program implementation period and include\n\n (i) \n\n (ii) \n\n (iii) \n\n (iv) \n\ncosts for labor redundancies across SOEs that are not to be liquidated and that\nwill retrench about 10 percent of their current staff (about $170 million);43\nunfunded pension fund liabilities of the redundant workforce to be laid off and\nemployees in companies to be liquidated or privatized (about $130 million);\ndebt restructuring costs for up to 60 SOEs, including debt-for-equity swaps, and\nthe settlement of long-term foreign exchange debt (about $420 million); and\nliquidation  of  8  nonviable  SOEs  and  settlement  of  their  outstanding  financial,\ntrade, and tax debts, and wage claims (about $80 million).\n\nThe adjustment costs significantly exceed the amount of the Program loan. The difference will\nbe financed by the Government partly out of the proceeds of privatization transactions.\n\nB. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n104.\nThe  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  three  years,  an  interest\nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending\nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee\nwill be capitalized in the loan); conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the\nterms of draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines; and\nother terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB\nwith (i) reasons for Indonesia\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on\nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own\nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice of ADB.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n105. MOF  will  act  as  the  Executing  Agency  to  coordinate  and  monitor  the  overall\nimplementation  of  the  Program,  and  administer  the  utilization  of  loan  proceeds.  MSOE  will  be\nthe  Implementing  Agency  and  will  coordinate  with  other  agencies  as  required.  MSOE  will\nprovide quarterly reports on the progress of the Program.\n\n106.\nTo monitor the progress, the Government will establish a high-level steering committee\nwith  representation  from  MSOE  (chairperson),  MOF,  the  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economy\nAffairs,  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  and  MOM.  The  committee\nwill  review  SOE  restructuring  and  privatization  strategies  and  endorse  these  or  recommend\nchanges if required. The primary authority for approving the strategies will remain with MSOE.\nThe  steering  committee  will  conduct  quarterly  reviews  of  program  implementation  and  will  be\nsupported by a corporate governance and privatization working group established within MSOE\nto closely oversee the development and implementation of financial and corporate restructuring,\nprivatization,  and  the  new  corporate  governance  policy  in  the  targeted  SOEs,  as  well  as\nimplementation of TA (footnote 6). A separate working group will oversee the implementation of\nthe  TA  for  commercialization  of  PSOs  (footnote  7).  The  steering  committee  will  be  further\nsupported by a consultative working group on labor redundancies.\n\n                                                          \n43 Surplus labor of 10 percent in the SOE sector is equivalent to 70,000 people. Given an average wage of $186 per\nmonth  and  legal  minimum  requirements  for  severence  payments  (footnote  30),  this  is  about  $174 million.  Taking\nrecent settlements of the SOEs PT Garuda (national airline) and PT IPTN (aircraft manufacturer) as a benchmark,\nthe cost may exceed $220 million. Applying the settlements reached between IBRA and the employees of closed\nbanks, the costs could even exceed $280 million.\n\n\fD. \n\nProcurement and Disbursements\n\n31\n\n107. Upon effectiveness, ADB will have the right to withdraw from the loan account and pay\nitself, on behalf of the Government, the front-end fee charged on the loan in the amount of $4\nmillion. The proceeds of the balance of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange\ncosts of items produced in, and procured from, ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items\nspecified  in  Appendix  6  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources,\nincluding other loans made by ADB). The Government will certify that, if (i) the proceeds of the\nloan  will  finance  imports  already  made,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the  period  concerned\nexceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) the loan proceeds are to finance goods\nto be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately preceding year period is equal to\nor greater than the amount of the requested disbursement plus all other amounts expected to be\nwithdrawn  from  the  loan  during  the  succeeding  one  year.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the\nuse of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\n\nE. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n108.\nThe Policy Matrix for the Program includes specific components that bear distinct costs\nof structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will\nbe used by the Government to finance the cost of such structural adjustments, as well as other\nactivities consistent with the Program.\n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\nThe  program  period  will  be  three  years  from  December  2001  to  December  2004.  The\n109.\nloan  will  be  disbursed  in  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $150  million44  is  expected  to  be\nmade  available  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  has  completed  all  first  tranche\nconditions prior to loan negotiations.\n\nThe second tranche, amounting to $150 million, is expected to be released by July 2003,\n\n110.\non completing the following six actions:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nappointment agreements for all newly appointed directors and commissioners will\nhave been signed;\n35 SOEs will have submitted SCIs to MSOE;\n80  percent  of  SOEs  will  have  filed  annual  reports  complying  fully  with  legal\ndisclosure  requirements  for  listed  companies  with  MSOE  and  the  Company\nRegistrar;\nindependent (non-BPKP) three-year financial audits for 30 SOEs will have been\nsubmitted to ADB;\nsatisfactory progress will have been achieved in the\n(a) \n(b) \nreports  of  procurement  audits  of  20  randomly  selected  SOEs  will  have  been\npresented to ADB.\n\nprivatization of 7 SOEs, and\nsale of Government shares in 5 minority shareholdings; and\n\nThe third tranche, amounting to $100 million, is expected to be released by July 2004,\n\n111.\nupon completing the following six actions:\n\n                                                          \n44 Upon effectiveness, ADB will withdraw from the loan account and pay itself, on behalf of the Government, the front-\n\nend fee charged on the loan in the amount of $4 million.\n\n\f32\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nappointment agreements will have been signed for all newly appointed directors\nand commissioners;\n50 SOEs will have submitted SCIs to MSOE;\n80  percent  of  SOEs  will  have  filed  annual  reports  complying  fully  with  legal\ndisclosure  requirements  for  listed  companies  with  MSOE  and  the  Company\nRegistrar;\nindependent (non-BPKP) financial audits will have been submitted to ADB for 30\nSOEs;\nsatisfactory progress will have been achieved in the\n(a) \n(b) \nreports  of  procurement  audits  of  20  randomly  selected  SOEs  will  have  been\npresented to ADB.\n\nprivatization of 8 SOEs, and\nsale of Government shares in 7 minority shareholdings; and\n\n112. An  additional  26  monitorable  policy  actions  will  be  carried  out  during  the  program\nimplementation. Most of them are important steps toward achieving conditions for the release of\nthe second and third tranches.\n\n113.\nThe  steering  committee  will  assess  the  implementation  of  the  Program  and,  through\nMOF, provide ADB with quarterly reports on the progress in all five program areas, including the\nprogress  in  quantitative  terms  in  conditions  for  the  next  tranche  release.  After  receiving  the\nsteering  committee  reports,  ADB  will  send  regular  review  missions  to  assess  compliance  with\nsuch conditions and advise on corrective actions required to keep the program implementation\non course. The Government will submit a program completion report to ADB at the end of the\nprogram period.\n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits\n\n114.\nThe proposed Program is an integral part of the Government's comprehensive efforts to\naddress  the  long-standing  distortions  in  the  Indonesian  economy.  Its  central  objective  is  to\nimprove  resource  allocation  in  the  public  sector  by  making  SOEs  efficient  and  profitable,  thus\nallowing them to pay higher dividends and corporate taxes to the Government. These revenues,\ntogether  with  the  proceeds  from  the  privatization  of  SOEs,  will  help  alleviate  budgetary\npressures and allow the Government to meet priority expenditure on social programs and social\nsafety net.\n\n115.\nThe  Program  prescribes  rigorous  corporate  governance  mechanisms,  based  on\ninternational  best  practices,  and  enforces  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  to  improve  the\naccountability  and  transparency  of  SOEs.  This  will  help  the  Government  gain  the  necessary\nauthority to enforce better corporate governance throughout the corporate sector. Strengthened\ncorporate  governance  in  SOEs  will  be  reflected  in  improved  transparency  in  dealings  with\nshareholders, lenders, employees, and other stakeholders in listed companies. The listing of a\nnumber of SOEs on the JSE in the future will set good examples for observance of corporate\ngovernance,  and  will  generate  the  necessary  market  pressure  on  other  listed  enterprises  to\nimplement the same improvements.\n\n116. Corporate  governance  is  not  an  issue  of  regulation,  but  one  of  enforcement.  Of  the\n288 companies  listed  on  the  JSE,  244  companies  are  majority  owned  by  large  conglomerates\nwith the attendant lack of transparency and absence of accountability to minority shareholders.\nTheir financial statements do not reflect the risk exposure as a part of the conglomerate and do\n\n\f33\n\nnot allow an assessment of the company's credit worthiness or of shareholder value. This has\ncontributed to a loss of confidence of international institutional investors in Indonesia. The listing\nof a large number of additional SOEs will increase the supply of quality securities on JSE and\nwill allow investors to make more informed decisions. This should enhance market discipline in\nJSE and reduce volatility in the equity market in the long run. A related benefit is that increased\ninvestor confidence will ease IBRA\u2019s task of disposing of a large part of its assets into the equity\nmarket.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\n117.\nIn the longer term, successful restructuring and privatization will increase job security for\nthe  employees  in  many  of  the  SOEs.  Without  Government  ownership,  and  resulting\nrelationships  with  state-owned  banks,  many  of  these  companies  would  be  bankrupt  by  now.\nHowever, with the new banking regulations now in place, these cozy relationships are about to\nend.  SOEs will now have to compete for credit as do their private sector counterparts. SOEs\nthat do not restructure are not likely to survive competition. A group of SOEs has been hit very\nhard by trade liberalization during the past years. In particular those active in manufacturing and\nprocessing of agricultural goods, such as sugar mills. Not only are they in a vulnerable financial\nposition,  but  are  also  not  internationally  competitive.  Only  rapid  privatization,  accompanied  by\ninjection of capital and know how, can make them more competitive and improve their chances\nfor  survival.  The  Government  neither  has  the  capital  nor  the  capability  to  continue  their\noperation.\n\nC. \n\nProgram Risks\n\n118.\nThe  implementation  of  the  Program  can  be  affected  by  several  factors.  The  principal\nrisk  relates  to  political  uncertainty  and  its  effect  on  the  pace  of  structural  reforms.  However,\nthere is a firm commitment to SOE reforms at the highest levels in the new Government, and\nconsequently, the risk of the Program being diluted or abandoned is limited.\n\n119.\nThe second risk stems from the potential opposition of vested interests. For instance, all\nmembers  of  BOCs  of  SOEs  are  public  servants\u2014many  with  limited  relevant  skills\u2014for  whom\nthe  monetary  and  fringe  benefits  of  the  position  provide  a  source  of  considerable  income.\nCorporate restructuring and the subsequent privatization will involve significant changes in the\ncomposition  of  BOCs  and,  hence,  a  loss  of  position,  income,  and  associated  social  prestige.\nFurthermore,  many  sector  ministries  have  traditionally  used  SOEs  as  an  additional  source  of\nrevenue to finance part of their expenditures and have enjoyed wide ranging benefits which will\nbe  withdrawn.  To  counter  resistance  from  these  vested  interests,  the  proposed  system  of\ncorporate  governance  is  designed  to  give  BODs  greater  authority  and  autonomy,  thereby\nreducing  their  willingness  to  collude  with  incompetent  BOCs.  Furthermore,  the  appointment\nagreements for directors and commissioners will change the incentive system for both groups\nby linking incentives to actual performance.\n\n120.\nThe third risk relates to the lack of capacity within the Government to effectively oversee\nand  monitor  SOE  reforms  and  restructuring,  and  implement  them  in  a  timely  and  effective\nmanner.  The  major  bottleneck  could  be  MSOE  as  it  is  lacking  experience  in  these  areas.  To\nmitigate  this  risk,  ADB  has  provided  TA  to  enhance  MSOE's  capacity  in  financial  and\noperational  analysis,  corporate  restructuring,  legal  aspects  of  restructuring  and  privatization,\nand  corporate  governance  (footnote  5).  Additional  TA  will  be  provided  in  conjunction  with  the\nProgram  to  ensure  continued  momentum  in  this  capacity  building  efforts  (footnote  6).  The\nProgram  also  prescribes  strict  accountability  on  the  part  of  members  of  BOCs,  who  have\ntraditionally  been  selected  from  the  ranks  of  bureaucrats  and  retired  military,  without\n\n\f34\n\nnecessarily having qualifications in accounting, management, or law. While there are examples\nof BOC members with adequate qualifications who are performing satisfactorily, many current\nmembers will not be able to cope with their new responsibilities. The Program will alleviate the\nproblem in two ways. First, MSOE will review of the capabilities of the BOC members. Those\nwith  no  relevant  skills  will  be  replaced.  Second,  necessary  training  will  be  provided  to  the\nremaining BOC members.\n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following\n\n121.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nto  cover  expenses  relating \n\nthe policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of Loan Agreement, as\ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  attached  policy  matrix\n(Appendix 1), will be in effect for the duration of the program period;\ncorporate  restructuring  and  privatization  of  SOEs  will  be  undertaken  in  a  fair,\ntransparent,  and  (to  the  extent  commercially  practicable)  competitive  manner,\nand  only  after  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  benefits  of  the  chosen  restructuring\noption  has  taken  place;  and  the  Government  will  make  the  necessary  funds\navailable for debt restructuring of SOEs in a timely manner;\nthe Government shall ensure that MSOE is provided with appropriate budgetary\nallocations \nto  (i)  dissemination  of  corporate\ninformation  from  SOEs  (including  annual  reports  and  SCIs)  through  print  media\nor  the  Internet,  (iii)  dissemination  of  information  about  the  Program  through  the\nInternet,  (iii)  engagement  of  procurement  and  financial  auditors,  and  (iv)\nengagement  of  advisors  for  privatization  transactions  and  debt  rescheduling\nnegotiations;\nlabor retrenchments will be carried out in accordance with the laws of Indonesia,\nand  the  Government  will  make  the  necessary  funds  available  for  voluntary\nretirement schemes in a timely manner;\npublic awareness campaigns will be developed and implemented to advertise the\nbenefits of the privatization program; and\nproceeds from the loan will not be utilized for SOE investment in modernization\nand capacity enlargement.\n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n122.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $400,000,000  to  the  Republic  of\nIndonesia for the State-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program from ADB's\nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-\nbased loan facility, an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and\nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the\ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n8 November 2001\n\n\f35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter and Policy Matrix\n\nProgram Framework\n\nCoverage and Implementation Schedule of\nthe Proposed Program and Related Technical\nAssistance\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\nMatrix of Potential Environmental Impacts of\nPolicy Covenants\n\nIneligible Items\n\n36\n\n46\n\n51\n\n56\n\n63\n\n68\n\n2,8\n\n2,8\n\n6,22\n\n26,91\n\n29,101\n\n31,107\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 1\n\nMIMSTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF INCONESIA\n\nJakarta, October 31, 2001\n\nMr. Tadao China\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\nManila, Philippines\n\nRe: Development Policy Letter\n\nDear Mr. President,\n\nThe  economic  crisis  that  affects  Indonesia  since  late  1997 brought  to  an  end  three\n1.\ndecades  of  uninterrupted  economic  growth.  The  crisis  has  crippled  the  economy.  It  dislocated\nthe  stable  macroeconomic  structure  before  the  crisis  due  in  part  to  the  huge  debt  increase\nbrought about by the currency depreciation. The crisis also triggered a political transition during\nthat period. Subsequent political changes in our difficult transition to a parliamentary democracy\nalso affected our efforts to stabilize the economy.\n\n2.\nSince the crisis, the International Monetary Fund has been assisting us in designing and\nimplementing  a  macroeconomic  stabilization  program  to  restructure  our  economy  and  make  it\nmore open, competitive and sustainable. The Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and other\ndevelopment  partners  had  worked  closely  with  the  IMF  to  support  cur  restructuring  efforts  that\nincluded substantive reforms in the real sector and public sector governance.\n\n3.\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  has  been  at  the  forefront  during  the  crisis  with  its\nassistance  to  the  financial  sector.  The  loan  complemented  the  IMF  and  WB  financial  sector\nreform  program,  including  bank  recapitalization.  This  loan  also  supported  efforts  to  improve\nfinancial governance and development of the capital market. Over the past four years, the ADB\nalso  extended  valuable  support  for  our  efforts  in  decentralization,  power  sector,  industrial  and\ntrade  liberalization  and  in  education,  agriculture,  and  poverty  programs.  The  ADB  technical\nassistance  program  has  also  improved  governance  through  an  audit  program  in  the  state\nattorney  department  and  legal  support  for  establishment  anti  corruption  and  anti  monopoly\ncommissions.\n\n4.\nAlthough it has been four years since the crisis, our economic recovery remains fragile.\nDomestic political uncertainties have contributed to delays in implementing the reform programs.\nThe election of Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri to be the fifth president of our Republic\nin late July ended domestic political uncertainties. A new cabinet was appointed on 9 August. It\nquickly concluded a Letter of Intent with the IMF and resumed our relations with the international\ncommunity including the successful conclusion of our Paris Club II arrangement. A draft FY 2002\nbudget was submitted and subsequently approved by the concerned parliamentary commission.\nHowever, the attack on US World Trade Center on 11 September and its impact on the global\neconomy  has  placed  at  risk  our  efforts  to  sustain  progress  in  economic  recovery.  This  has\nstrengthened our resolve to speed up our reform program including the state enterprise sector.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 2\n\nMINISTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA\n\nThe  reform  of  our  state  enterprise  sector  is  an  integral  part  of  our  overall  recovery\n5.\nstrategy  to  improve  our  economy\u2019s  efficiency  and  competitiveness.  The  performance  of  our\nSOEs  has  deteriorated  over  the  years.  Poor  financial  management  and  supervision,  weak\ngovernance  structures,  protected  markets  and  monopolies  are  some  of  the  reasons  for  the\ninefficiencies  in  these  enterprises  and  many  have  continued  to  be  a  heavy  burden  on  our\nbudget.\n\n6.\nThe  government  has  attempted  to  deal  with  the  sector  reform  by  transferring  the\nresponsibility  for  SOE  administration  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  a  new  State  Ministry  for\nEmpowerment in May 1998. A strategic goal of this ministry was to improve the performance of\nSOEs  through  restructuring  and  privatization.  A  technical  assistance  extended  by  the  ADB\ncontributed  to  the  preparation  of  a  Master  Plan  for  SOE  Reforms  that  was  adopted  by  the\ngovernment  in  May  2000.  This  Plan  outlines  the  broad  objectives,  policies  and  guidelines  on\nrestructuring and privatization of SOEs. The State Ministry was dissolved in October 1999 with a\nchange in government and the Ministry of Finance regained its supervision over SOEs. The SOE\nreform program was continued under the Ministry of Finance. The present government accorded\nhigh priority to SOE reform and a Ministry for State Owned Enterprises was reintroduced when\nthe government took office in August 2001.\n\n7.\nWhen  the  SOE  reform  program  commenced  in  1998,  a  group  of  12  of  the  largest\nenterprises  in  the  telecom,  mining,  cement,  airports,  seaports,  tool  roads,  steel  and  plantation\nsectors were identified for priority restructuring and privatization. The experienced gained allows\nu~  to  accelerate  the  reform  process  to  improve  enterprise  efficiency,  promote  greater\ntransparency and accountability and corporate governance. These are reflected in our program\nfor systematic reform of the SOE sector.\n\nThis program contains five components:\n\ninstilling improved corporate governance practices,\nseparating public service obligations from SOEs\u2019 commercial operations,\n implementing corporate restructuring and privatization,\n managing social impacts of SOE reforms, and\nintroduce competitive and transparent processes of procurement.\n\n8.\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n\n9\nhereunder.\n\nThe  specific  objectives  and  measures  to  be  pursued  under  the  Program  are  set  out\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 3\n\nMINISTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA\n\n10.\nThe  Program  will  introduce  sound  practices  for  corporate  governance\u2014a  broad  set  of\nincentives,  structures,  and  procedures  that  will  drive  SOEs  to  act  in  the  best  interests  of  their\nultimate shareholders \u2014 the public. A Statement of Corporate Intent will be the major instrument\nto  enforce  accountability  of  SOEs  and  will  allow  the  Government  to  effectively  uphold  property\nrights. The Program will improve the quality and availability of SOE corporate information. This\nincludes developing a timetable for complying with uniform accounting standards applicable to all\nSOEs,  lodging  timely  information  with  the  Company  Register  and  piloting  the  function  of  a\ncorporate secretary who will be responsible for providing corporate information to the public. The\nfinancial  transparency  of  SOEs  will  be  enhanced  so  that  prospective  investors  can  readily\nassess SOE investment opportunities. The accountability of Directors and Commissioners will be\nenhanced through contractual arrangements clearly outlining their rights and obligations.\n\n11.\nThe  Program  supports  the  restructuring  and  eventual  privatization  of  SOEs  in  a\nstructured  and  transparent  manner.  A  systematic  and  analytical  framework  is  already  being\napplied  to  assess  the  financial  and  commercial  viability  of  the  SOEs  and  define  their  financial\nand  operational  restructuring  needs.  Based  on  the  assessment,  the  Government  will  move  to\nliquidate the commercially and financially non-viable SOEs, undertake appropriate restructuring\nof the commercially viable SOEs before privatization, and will implement plans of privatization for\nthose  SOEs  which  need  to  undergo  only  limited  restructuring  prior  to  privatization.  Under  the\nProgram, the Government will continue the process of separating public service obligations from\npurely  commercial  activities  of  SOEs  and  putting  in  place  a  transparent  system  of  explicit\nsubsidies for socially desired services. The Program will also develop and introduce competitive\nmechanisms for publicly tendering contracts for these services.\n\n12.\nThe  SOE  restructuring  and  privatization  is  likely  to  render  a  significant  number  of\nemployees  redundant.  The  Program  will  establish  a  systematic  process  of  consultation  and\nnegotiations  on  labor  rationalization.  A  transparent  policy  will  be  developed  to  deal  with\nredundancies, retraining and pension issues. Within the policy framework, SOEs will submit their\nindividual labor restructuring plans to the Government, which will ensure the application of best\npractices in negotiations between employees and management.\n\nThe Program will have a strong anti-corruption thrust by applying and enforcing existing\n13.\nrules and regulations in the area of SOE procurement. Specifically, the Government will publicly\nannounce  that  SCE  procurements  shall  comply  with  the  national  procurement  guidelines.  The\nGovernment  will  also  engage  external  auditors  to  conduct  random  audits  of  SOE  procurement\npractices and will publish the audit reports.\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 1, page 4\n\nMINISTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE ~EPUBL~C QF INDONECIA\n\n14.\nThe  State-Owned  Enterprise  Governance  and  Privatization  Program  as  summarized\nabove  sets  out  the  broad  agenda  for  furthering  the  SOE  restructuring  and  privatization.  The\nGovernment  is  convinced  that  the  comprehensive  measures  to  be  implemented  under  the\nProgram along with the parallel structural reforms will pave the way for efficient and broad-based\neconomic  growth  in  the  coming  years.  The  two  ADB  technical  assistance  projects  for\nprivatization  and  restructuring  of  SOEs  and  commercialization  of  public  service  obligations  will\nstrengthen the government\u2019s efforts to reform the sector.\n\n15.\nIn addition to such advisory support, the SOE reform program will incur substantial fiscal\ncost  for  the  reform  of  the  sector.  The  fiscal  constrain  of  the  government  will  inhibit  sustained\nefforts  to  reform  the  sector.  In  this  connection,  the  government  requests  for  a  loan  of  $400\nmillion from ADB to support the implementation of this program.\n\n16.\nThe government is committed to the timetable for implementation of the policy matrix on\nSOE  Reform.  The  government  will  set  up  a  Program  Steering  Committee  to  oversee  program\nimplementation. This group will include representatives from different ministries and agencies to\nimprove  coordination  in  the  implementation  of  this  program.  The  government  will  maintain  an\nactive  policy  dialogue  with  the  ADB  during  program  implementation,  including  introducing\nadditional measures to ensure that the Program goals are met.\n\n17. We look to working closely with the ADB to implement this important reform program.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n     Boediono\n     MInister of Finance\n\n\fDraft Policy Matrix\nState-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program (SOEGPP)\n\nProgram Objectives: The proposed Program will improve resource allocation in the public sector, increase profitability of Indonesia\u2019s\nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  and  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  commercial  activities  of  SOEs.  Reform  of  SOEs,\ninvolving  transfer  of  ownership  and  management,  and  confining  the  Government\u2019s  role  to  policymaking  and  regulation,  will  release\nscarce resources for poverty reduction and social programs. This will be achieved by (i) subjecting SOEs to sound corporate governance\npractices,  (ii)  separating  commercial  activities  of  SOEs  from  their  public  service  obligations  (PSOs),  (iii)  restructuring  and  privatizing\nSOEs, (iv) establishing fair and transparent procedures for managing labor redundancies, and (v) strengthening and effectively enforcing\nguidelines for procurement in SOEs.\n\nPolicy Actions1\n\nAction\ncompleted\n(1998 to Nov\n2001)\n\nSecond\nTranche\nConditions\nJuly 2003\n\nThird\nTranche\nCondition\nJuly 2004\n\nA.

Public  sector  inefficiency,  corruption,  and  waste  have  left  the\nGovernment  with  insufficient  resources  to  support  the  requisite  level  and  quality  of  public\nservices  and  targeted  antipoverty  programs.  The  SOEGPP  will  support  the  establishment  of\ngood governance, giving a role model for both public and private sectors, which, if followed, will\nfacilitate  participatory,  pro-poor  policies,  as  well  as  sound  macroeconomic  management.\nSOEGPP  will  advance \ntransparent  use  of  public  funds,  encourage  sound  fiscal\nmanagement, promote efficient delivery of public services, and help establish the rule of law.\n\nthe \n\n3.\nPrivatization  as  supported  by  the  SOEGPP  will  improve  productive  and  allocative\nefficiency.  Therefore,  prices  of  goods  and  services  produced  by  the  privatized  enterprises\nshould  decline  and  their  quality  should  improve.  While  SOEs  have  been  heavily  subsidized  in\nthe past, most of the subsidies have been abolished or are in the process of being abolished.\nPrivatization  will  only  occur  after  the  enterprises  have  been  placed  into  a  competitive\nenvironment.  By  removing  economic  distortions  in  the  competitive  environment  first,  the\nGovernment  increases  the  probability  that  higher  productivity  and  allocative  efficiency  will  be\nachieved.\n\n4.\nPrivatization affects income distribution through three channels. The first channel is the\nshift of real assets from the state to the private sector, with consequences for the distribution of\ncapital  income.  If  the  price  paid  for  the  asset  is  close  to  the  discounted  present  value  of  the\nfuture  income  stream,  no  negative  distributive  impact  will  arise.  The  problem  arises  where\nassets  are  sold  at  a  price  below  value,  particularly  if  due  to  corruption.  To  address  this,\nSOEGPP will establish sales procedures establishing maximum transparency, and support the\nprivatization  by  providing  privatization  experts  through  TAs.  The  second  channel  is  labor\nincome,  which  should  generally  increase  over  time  for  those  retained  in  their  job.  The  third\nchannel  is  wage  differentials,  which  are  typically  wider  in  the  private  than  in  the  public  sector,\nand privatization will tend to reinforce them. However, the decompression of pay scales can be\nexpected to be phased in slowly over time.\n\n5.\nSOEs are not a major source of employment. In total, the SOEs employ about 700,000\npeople  directly  and  another  700,000  indirectly  through  contract  and  subcontract  labor\narrangements.  This  is  less  than  1.5  percent  of  the  overall  labor  force2  and  4.5  percent  of  the\nformal  labor  force.3    Furthermore,  wages  and  benefits  paid  by  the  SOEs  are  not  significantly\ndifferent from those paid by the private sector for the most vulnerable category of worker, those\nbelow the supervisor level. Unlike some formerly centrally planned economies, the SOEs were\n\n                  \n\n1 Compare  ADB,  Fighting  Poverty  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific:  The  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  of  the  Asian\n\nDevelopment Bank, Manila, page 8, 19 October.\n\n2 As  of  August  1999,  this  was  94  million  people,  and  defined  as  those  15  years  or  older  who  were  working,  were\ntemporarily absent from work, or who didn\u2019t have work but were looking for work. \u201cWorking\u201d is an activity done for\npay or to assist others in obtaining pay or profit for the duration of at least one hour during the survey week.\n\n3 The  formal  labor  force  is  defined  as  comprising  employers  and  employees,  and  excludes  the  self-employed  and\n\nunpaid family workers.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nnot  a  major  source  of  employment  and  they  did  not  provide  a  large  range  of  social  services.4\nNonetheless, treatment of labor by the SOEs sets an important standard of behavior for private\nsector enterprises.\n\nSOEs have about 10-20 percent surplus employment, or 70,000-140,000 people, with 20\n6.\npercent  considered  an  outside  maximum  and  10 percent  representing  the  more  reasonable\nestimate.  As  national  open  unemployment  was  estimated  as  6,030,000  in  August  1999,\novernight  layoffs  would  not  result  in  an  appreciable  increase  in  overall  numbers  although  the\nimpact  could  be  significant  at  a  local  level.  Surplus  managerial  staff  exists  where  firms  have\nundergone  mergers  such  as  in  the  plantation  industry  as  well  as  below  the  supervisor  level\nwhere  changes  in  technology  have  reduced  the  need  for  low  skill  labor  and  necessitate  a\ndifferent skill mix.  For this reason, most layoffs are likely to occur at lower levels and therefore\nwill affect people who will then be less likely to find equivalent employment in the formal sector.\nLegally  mandated  severance  standards  are  considered  inadequate  by  labor  representatives.\nNegotiated settlements tend to exceed the minimum standards. Compared to the private sector,\nSOE  employees  are  at  a  disadvantage  in  such  negotiations  as  prior  to  1999  they  were  not\nallowed  to  unionize  or  engage  in  collective  bargaining.  As  a  result  they  have  little  practical\nexperience  in  negotiating  their  interest  with  management.  Conversely  management  has  had\nlittle experience in dialogue with labor in employment and employment related issues.\n\nFor this reason, SOEGPP puts a strong emphasis on establishing a consultative working\n7.\ngroup  on  labor  relations,  with  representatives  of  all  stakeholders  to  develop  a  labor\nrationalization  policy  within  the  Ministry  of  State-Owned  Enterprises  (MSOE).  The  consultative\nworking  group  is  expected  to  develop  standards  for  negotiating  settlements,  to  serve  as  a\nconduit  for  information  for  labor  representatives,  and  provide  a  forum  for  policy  discussion\nregarding  unresolved  labor  issues  such  as  the  treatment  of  contract  labor.  Once  approved  by\nthe Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), this report will be available to the\npublic  and  will  provide  information  to  labor  representatives  and  advocates  regarding  the\nGovernment\u2019s  intentions  and  schedule  for  corporate  restructuring  and  privatization.  Thus,  the\nSOEGPP  will  provide  a  channel  for  workers  and  their  representatives  to  participate  more  fully\nand in an informed way in a dialogue to ensure their best interest.\n\nThe  poverty  impact  assessment  matrixes  are  presented  below,  with  a  more  detailed\n\n8.\ndiscussion of the individual conditionalities of the SOEGPP.\n\nA. \n\nPolicy Area A: Corporate Governance\n\n9.\nThese  measures  will  result  in  (i)  the  implementation  of  new  corporate  governance\npolicies  and  procedures  for  MSOE  and  boards  of  commissioners  and  directors,  (ii) an\nindependent  financial  and  management  audit  of  all  SOEs,  (iii)  a  review  of  commissioners  and\ndirectors  for  more  than  half  of  all  SOEs,  and  (iv)  implementation  of  performance  incentive\nsystems for management and employees. These measures will also introduce sound corporate\ngovernance practices to empower and encourage managers to act in the best interest of their\nshareholders, the people of Indonesia.  Implementation of the statements of corporate intent will\nrequire  SOEs  to  report  compliance  on  a  number  of  regulations,  including  those  regarding\nemployment. Overall, these measures will result in better management and fairer treatment of\n\n                  \n\n4 Certain industries that developed in remote areas such as in the plantation and mining sector provided access to\nsocial services, clinics, and schools. Prior to the crisis, such services were being rationalized. Other benefits were\nlimited  to  specific  categories  of  employees.  Until  recently  in  the  plantation  sector  only  employees  in  positions\ndesignated as staff were entitled to a pension.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nlabor  and  ultimately  greater  efficiency  and  returns  to  public  investment,  growth,  and  poverty\nreduction.

At the same time,\nthe  assignment  of  monopoly  rights  and  protectionism  has  stifled  the  development  of  a\ncompetitive private sector. Cross-subsidy between profitable and unprofitable operations within\na company mask inefficiencies of operation and fails to promote the efficient provision of quality\nservices.  As a result of protectionist policies and poor management, Indonesian consumers pay\nhigher prices for a range of essential commodities, including drugs and pesticides. The efforts to\nprovide subsidies to particular sectors have resulted in market distortions, capture of subsidies\nby  unintended  groups  including  the  producers  themselves,  and  a  poor  return  to  national\ninvestment.  If  subsidies  cannot  be  abolished  for  political  reasons,  their  true  cost  should  be\nexplicit and the subsidy delivered in an efficient and targeted fashion.\n\n11.\nThe  measures  promoted  under  the  program  identify  the  types  of  SOE  public  service\nobligations and establish mechanisms for efficient provision by the private sector or continued\nprovision by SOEs with clear identification of costs and intended levels of subsidies. Regulated\nand  private  provision  of  public  service  obligations  or  continued  SOE  provision  with  the\nestablishment of clear cost centers and subsidy mechanisms will reduce the distorting impact of\nthese  obligations  on  SOE  operations  while  promoting  low  cost  and  efficient  provision  of\nservices.

This  will  provide  the  MSOE  with  an  operational  procedure  for\nimplementing  privatization.  To  reduce  the  drain  on  the  budget,  criteria  and  procedures  are\nagreed  upon  for  liquidating  nonviable  SOEs.  To  obtain  the  best  price  for  SOEs  slated  for\nprivatization,  their  profitability  and  potential  is  demonstrated  through  the  implementation  of\nperformance targets as set out in the statements of corporate intent (SCIs) (see policy area A).\nThe privatization process is accelerated through the selection of the best privatization options of\nSOEs  requiring  limited  restructuring  and  reduction  of  the  shareholding  of  SOEs  where  the\nGovernment  has  decided  to  retain  some  interest.  Table  A4.3  summarizes  the  effects  of\nrestructuring SOEs.\n\nChannel\nTransfers\n\nNet Impact\nNarrative\n\nTable A4.3: Effects of Corporate Restructuring\n\nDirect\n\nIndirect\n\nNon-Poor\n\nMacro\nIncreased government\nrevenue for development\nexpenditures\n\nPositive\nThese measures are necessary to enable the Government to obtain the best return from the\ndivestiture of commercially viable SOEs and reduce the drain on the national budget from the\nsupport of non viable SOEs.\n\nSOE = state-owned enterprises.\n\nD. \n\nPolicy Area D:  Labor Redundancies\n\n13.\nThe level of skill and the education profile of the SOE labor force is higher than that of\nthe  formal  labor  force  where  44  percent  of  the  labor  force  has  no  more  than  an  elementary\nschool  education.  The  plantation  sector,  accounting  for  50  percent  of  the  labor  force,  is  a\nsignificant exception to this. In the remaining SOEs, the proportion of low skill labor is very low\ndue to the generally higher skill requirement of the production process as well as the practice of\noutsourcing  unskilled  and  casual  work.  Low  skill  labor  for  casual  work,  stevedoring,\nlandscaping, and general cleaning services are obtained through service contracts with private\nfirms. As a result, outside of the plantation sector, SOE employees tend to be more educated\nthan the general labor force.\n\n14.\nAs with the private sector, the SOE labor force tends to be segregated by gender with\nwomen  clustered  in  occupations  at  the  low  end  of  the  pay  scale.  In  the  plantations  they  tend\nnurseries, carry out maintenance, spread fertilizer, harvest cacao and tea, tap rubber, or work\nas clerics. They are seldom in supervisory positions. Outside of the plantations women tend to\nbe found in SOEs that require a high degree of customer service such as toll collection or cabin\nflight assistance.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\n1. \n\nStaffing issues\n\n15.\nThe  degree  to  which  staffing  levels,  staff  qualifications,  and  staff  management  are  an\nissue varies significantly from company to company. Part of the overstaffing problem has arisen\nfrom  the  slowdown  in  demand  and  is  to  some  extent  self  correcting.  Some  SOEs  provide  a\nknowledge-based product (chemicals, semiconductors) with a large investment in staff training.\nIt is in the interest of such firms to retain their employees during a downturn. Some SOEs are\noverstaffed  at  management  levels  as  a  result  of  merger  and  consolidation.  The  present\nplantation  and  forestry  SOEs  are  the  result  of  the  consolidation  of  smaller  plantations  and\nrelated downstream business units. PTP Nusantara IV is the result of a merger of 25 separate\nbusiness  units  and  consolidation  has  resulted  in  significant  duplication  of  administrative  staff\nand management staff.\n\n2. \n\nLabor Relations\n\nLabor relations are in a state of change following the introduction of a new labor law that\n16.\nenabled  free  association  and  the  establishment  of  new  unions  in  keeping  with  International\nLabor  Organization  (ILO)  convention  87.  This  law  came  into  force  in  June  1999.  Previously,\nSOE  employees  were  considered  quasi-civil  servants.  SOE  employees  were  obligatory\nmembers  of  Korpri  (Corps  of  Civil  Servants)  and  were  not  allowed  to  become  labor  union\nmembers. SOE employee participation in Korpri became discretionary in November 1998, after\nwhich  SOE  employees  could  join  labor  unions  and  enter  into  collective  labor  agreements.\nEstablishment  of  plant-level  unions  within  the  SOEs  has  been  initiated  with  MSOE\u2019s  blessing,\nalthough the role of these unions is curtailed by their relative lack of experience. In addition SOE\nemployees  and  contract  workers  have  begun  to  join  the  established  labor  unions.  Various\nefforts  are  under  way  to  promote  understanding  of  the  role  and  function  of  unions  among\nworkers  and  management.  The  Ministry  of  Manpower,  with  ILO  assistance,  has  been  training\nunions  in  how  to  function  in  both  private  and  public  sector  organizations  and  promoting\nunderstanding of labor unions and collective bargaining for personnel management. The labor\nfederations  such  as  SPSI  (All  Indonesian  Worker\u2019s  Union),  SPSI-R  (All-Indonesian  Workers\nUnion-Reformation), and SBSI (Indonesia Prosperous Worker\u2019s Union) have been carrying out\ntheir  own  outreach  efforts.    While  considerable  work  remains  to  develop  mature  labor  unions,\nthese organizations agree that their own efforts will be facilitated by a policy dialogue promoting\nopen  discussion  of  labor  issues  and  by  access  to  information  regarding  labor  practices  and\nplans for restructuring and privatization. The establishment of a consultative working group on\nlabor rationalization will enable such policy and access.\n\n3. \n\nLabor Protection Issues\n\nLabor  protection  issues  that  are  likely  to  arise  as  a  result  of  a  retrenchment  process\n17.\ninclude entitlement to employer\u2019s contributions with pension fund, unfunded liabilities, payout for\nSOEs with insufficient funds, and provisions for subcontracted labor.  Support may be required\nto fulfill pension obligations for early retirement pay. While many SOEs are establishing or have\nestablished  fully  funded  pension  funds  in  conformity  with  new  Ministry  of  Finance  regulations,\nsome have not been able to meet the funding requirements and continue to hold their pensions\nin  pension  foundations.  Other  SOEs  pay  pensions  out  of  operating  expenses.  Employer\ncontributions  match  or  exceed  employee  pension  contributions.  While  most  pension  schemes\nhave provisions for early retirement, few have provisions for retrenchment. Clarification must be\nsought from the Ministry of Finance regarding entitlement to employer contributions. Measures\nwill be required to avoid imposing an undue burden on pension funds that have invested in long-\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 4, page 6\n\nterm  instruments  and  may  find  a  large  and  unscheduled  pay-out  requirement  difficult  to  meet.\nFunding  will  be  required  for  firms  unable  to  meet  severance  payment  obligations.    In  some\ncases, additional provisions will be required for subcontracted labor.\n\n4. \n\nCurrent Experience with Retrenchment\n\n18. While SOE restructuring was under way on a limited scale prior to the crisis, the need for\nrestructuring  has  intensified.  However  there  has  been  little  experience  with  large  scale\nretrenchment.  As  a  consequence,  few  company  regulations,  pension  funds,  or  labor\nagreements have provisions for retrenchment.\n\n19.\nThe experience to date has been mixed. The national aircraft manufacturer (IPTN) had a\nrelatively  smooth  retrenchment  process  beginning  with  benchmarking  and  dissemination  of\nbenchmarking  results,  then  discussion  and  debate  among  employees,  culminating  in  the\nformulation  of  a  formal  employee  recommendation  for  a  retrenchment  plan,  procedures,  and\nlevel  of  compensation  for  consideration  by  management.  The  plan  gave  several  scenarios  of\nwhich one was adopted. The program was announced and a center established where workers\ncould  calculate  what  they  would  get  if  they  accepted  the  voluntary  retrenchment  and  early\nretirement scheme. Programs were run for families of employees and the spouse had to agree\nfor the application to be accepted. The first wave targeted all employees with only elementary\nand  junior  high  education.  The  second  wave  targeted  employees  from  vocational  junior  and\nsenior  high  schools.  By  the  time  of  the  ADB  mission  appraisal,  2,500  employees  had  been\nretrenched  through  this  process  and  a  third  selection  wave  was  under  way.  PT  Wijaya  Karya\nhad undergone a 15 percent reduction in the workforce. This was facilitated by the provision for\nretrenchment  in  all  employment  agreements  and  a  system  for  regular  personnel  review  and\nassessment. Retrenched employees were provided counseling. Some outplacement assistance\nand some lower level employees were provided skills training. The 40 private banks unilaterally\nestablished a package of compensation for workers, which was not accepted, and this has led\nto  acrimonious  and  protracted  discussion.  The  Indonesian  Bank  Restructuring  Agency  finally\nreached  an  agreement  with  retrenched  employees  of  banks  after  18  months  of  protracted\nnegotiations.\n\nThe current best practices indicate the difficulty in developing rules of thumb in terms of\n20.\nmonths  of  pay  that  would  constitute  fair  practice.  Industry  characteristics,  state  of  the  labor\nmarket,  skill  level  of  the  employee,  and  length  of  tenure  are  variables  to  be  considered.  The\nultimate measure of an effective arrangement is worker and management satisfaction with the\nagreement. This is reached through a process involving the provision of information followed by\nconsultations and then negotiations.\n\n21.\nThe  measures  under  this  part  of  the  Program  support  strengthening  the  system  for\nsocial  protection  in  Indonesia.  Existing  legal  standards  are  generally  agreed  to  be  adequate.\nHowever, they can only regulate minimum standards as it is difficult to develop standards that\nare adequate to cover the full range of skills, experience, and labor market segments in which\nthey  are  to  be  applied.  ADB,  through  its  technical  assistance,  will  have  a  significant  role  in\nassisting  MSOE  to  develop  policies  for  a  retrenchment  process  based  on  the  best  practices\nevolving  within  the  SOEs  and  from  international  example.  This  will  help  ensure  that  workers\nreceive  an  equitable  compensation  package  and  to  resolve  issues  regarding  entitlement  to\nemployer\u2019s  contributions  to  pension  funds,  unfunded  liabilities,  payouts  for  SOEs  with\ninsufficient  funds,  potential  burden  on  pension  funds,  and  any  issues  that  may  arise  from\nexcessive use of contract labor.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 4, page 7\n\nTable A4.4: Effects of Retrenchment Mitigation\n\nChannel\nLabor\n\nNon-Poor\n(cid:1) \n(cid:1) \n\nStrengthens labor protection by promoting best practices in retrenchment.(1)\nEnsures that retrenched workers are able to obtain the agreed payouts and benefits due.\n(2)\n\nCrucial\nAssumptions\n\n(1)  Establishment  of  procedures  and  process  for  retrenchment  that  provide  information,\n\ncommunication, and negotiations through the Consultative Working Group\n\n(2)  Resolution  of  issues  regarding  entitlement  to  employer  contribution  to  pension  funds,\nunfunded  liabilities,  payouts  for  SOEs  with  insufficient  funds,  and  potential  burden  on\npension funds.\n\nNet Impact\nNarrative\n\nPositive\nThe  benefits  of  these  measures  to  strengthen  labor  protection  practices  goes  beyond  the\nprogram to benefit workers in the private sector.
