It  supports  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal \nframework (MTFF) through the implementation of the joint policy action matrix (JPAM) on public \nfinancial management (PFM) policies and processes, developed by the Government of Samoa \nand its development partners.2 \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  context.  As  a  small  (population  180,000)  island  state  with  a  very  open \neconomy,  Samoa  is  highly  vulnerable  to  exogenous  shocks  and faces  particular challenges  in \nachieving sustainable development. The global economic crisis in 2008, a tsunami in 2009, and \nTropical  Cyclone  Evan  in  2012  have  had  adverse,  long-lasting  impacts  on  growth,  which \naveraged  just  1.2%  during  FY2008\u2013FY2015,  well  below  the  4.3%  average  during  FY1999\u2013\nFY2007. Growth increased to 6.4% in FY2016 with strong performance in the fishing, tourism, \ntransport,  and  construction  sectors.  New  fishing  operators  have  contributed  to  a  more  than \ndoubling of output over FY2015 and FY2016. Growth in visitor arrivals has contributed to growth \nin  the  tourism  and  transport  sectors.  Upgrading  of  the  airport  and  investments  in  hotels  are \ncontributing  to  increased  construction  activity.  Growth  remains  highly  volatile,  however,  and  is \nexpected  to  decline  to  2.0%  in  FY2017  as  a  result  of  the  imminent  closure  of  Samoa\u2019s \nautomotive wire harness plant (a significant manufacturing sector employer, with 740 staff).3 \n \nNarrow and vulnerable economic base. Samoa\u2019s vulnerability stems in large part from \n4. \nits  limited  resources.  The  economy  is  characterized  by  a  large  nonmonetary  sector  and  a \nrelatively  high  dependence  on  remittances  and  development  assistance.  Two-thirds  of  all \nSamoans depend on the agriculture sector for their livelihoods\u2014mainly small-scale subsistence \nfarming and fishing at the local level. The manufacturing sector (with the exception of the wire \nharness  plant)  largely  processes  agricultural  produce,  which  makes  up  the  bulk  of  Samoa\u2019s \nexports.  Tourism  accounts  for  approximately  25%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  with \nSamoa  receiving  approximately  135,000  visitors  per  year.  Samoa\u2019s  reliance  on  these  two \nsectors  increases  its  vulnerability  to  damage  and  loss  from  natural  disasters,  which  have \nimmediate impacts on the economy, and on the welfare of the majority of the population. Post-\ndisaster needs assessments following the recent disasters estimated that the tsunami cost the \neconomy $124 million in lost output, equivalent to 22% of GDP in 2009; Tropical Cyclone Evan \ncost $204 million in lost output, equivalent to 28% of GDP in 2012. \n \n5. \nPrivate sector development is constrained. The small size of the economy precludes \nsome  economic  activity,  while  lack  of  scale  means  private  sector  firms  are  relatively  small, \nlimiting the absorptive capacity for both aid and investment. The lack of access to finance, gaps \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Development  partners  include  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New \nZealand, the European Union, and the World Bank. The list of linked documents is in Appendix 2, the development \npolicy letter is in Appendix 3, and the policy matrix for subprograms 1 and 2 is in Appendix 4. \n\n3  Radio  New  Zealand.  2016.  Yazaki  Samoa  to  shut  down  in  2017,  hundreds  to  lose  jobs.  12  October. \nwww.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/315443/yazaki-samoa-to-shut-down-in-2017,-hundreds-to-lose-jobs \n\n\fin  the  commercial  legal  framework,  inefficient  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  barriers  to \nagricultural development, and poorly defined property rights are some of the identified barriers \nto private sector development. An opaque and difficult foreign investment regime has resulted in \nnet  foreign  direct  investment  averaging  the  equivalent  of  just  2.8%  of  GDP  per  year  during \nFY2006\u2013FY2016.  As  a  result  of  the  constrained  private  sector,  the  public  sector  is  left  with  a \nsignificantly large share of the burden of delivering necessary services, which has to be funded \nthrough  a  relatively  higher  proportion  of  taxes  and  other  sources  of  revenue.  Economic \ndiversification will lead to a more resilient economy in which the private sector is able to deliver \na  wider  range  of  services,  with  a  reduced  role  for  the  public  sector.  Private  sector  growth  is \nwidely acknowledged to be an essential component of poverty alleviation through the provision \nof an increased number and range of economic opportunities, thereby reducing the burden on \npublic delivery of poverty-alleviation measures.  \n \n6. \nFinancial  inflows  require  diversification.  Remittances  and  development  assistance \ncontribute about a quarter of annual GDP. Remittances largely support private consumption and \nare an integral part of the traditional social welfare system that supports Samoa\u2019s largely rural-\nbased population. Following the global economic crisis, remittances declined from an average of \n22.0%  of  GDP  in  FY2004\u2013FY2009  to  an  average  of  20.0%  of  GDP  in  FY2010\u2013FY2016;  the \ndecline  in  remittances  occurred  despite  the  two  subsequent  natural  disasters.  The  series  of \nexogenous shocks caused growth to slow to an average of 1.2% in FY2008\u2013FY2015. Domestic \nrevenues declined sharply in FY2010\u2013FY2012 to an average of 23.2% of GDP, and then rose \nbeginning in FY2013, with domestic revenue collection reaching 26.8% of GDP in FY2016. The \ngovernment responded with  a  substantial fiscal stimulus financed  by grants  and  domestic  and \nexternal debt accumulation (largely concessional), as well as monetary stimulus in the form of \nlower interest rates. The government is committed to economic diversification to develop a more \nresilient  economic  structure.  Diversification  is  focused  beyond  the  agriculture  and  tourism \nsectors,  and  includes  recent  investments  in  the  transport  and  communication  sectors. \nDevelopment partners have worked closely with the government to provide support, with grants \naveraging 9.2% of GDP during FY2009\u2013FY2015. Growth has been slow to accelerate, however, \nand fiscal deficits and debt levels remain high.

Although fiscal expansion undertaken in recognition of the weak \n7. \neconomic environment provided some impetus for growth, it resulted in high fiscal deficits and \nescalating  public  debt.  The  government  sought  to  stimulate  the  economy  through  public \ninvestments  in  infrastructure,  but  this  did  not  result  in  higher  growth.  Expenditures  on  the \nhosting of regional and international events also did not result in higher visitor spending or the \nintended  economic  stimulus. Two\u2013thirds  of the budget funded recurrent  expenditures  with  one \nthird  allocated  to  development  expenditures.  Interest  was  a  major  driver  of  the  10%  annual \ngrowth  in  recurrent  expenditures  during  FY2008\u2013FY2016;  this  compared  with  3%  growth  in \nwage  expenditures.  Tax  revenues  have  fluctuated  since  FY2008,  falling  to  a  low  of  19.6%  of \nGDP  in  FY2011  and  FY2012,  and  gradually  increasing  to  24.2%  of  GDP  in  FY2016.  Nontax \nrevenues fell from 3.3% of GDP in FY2008 to 1.9% in FY2013; following inflation adjustments to \ngovernment fees and charges, nontax revenues increased to 2.6% of GDP in FY2016. \n \n8. \nDeficits  exceeded  targets.  Since  FY2009,  budget  deficits  have  exceeded  the \ngovernment\u2019s long-term target of 3.5% of GDP, and public debt rose from around 30% of GDP \nin FY2008 to about 53% in FY2016.4 The increase in debt was a result of both the recovery and \nreconstruction  needs  (power  sector  expansion,  agriculture  sector  support,  post-tsunami \nreconstruction, and general budget support loans), and the construction of a national broadband \nnetwork and public buildings funded by the China EXIM Bank (such as the convention center, a \nnational medical center, office complexes, and a recent upgrade of the airport terminal building). \nThe increase in debt requires the government to continuously strengthen its debt management. \nWith  the  recovery  phase  following  the  2012  cyclone  coming  to  an  end,  grant  assistance \ndeclined  to  an  estimated  6.7%  of  GDP  in  FY2016  (from  an  average  of  10.5%  of  GDP  during \nFY2013\u2013FY2015), which required the government to reduce total expenditures. The fiscal deficit \nin  FY2016  was  reduced  to  0.4%  of  GDP,  which  was  largely  achieved  through  lower \ndevelopment and recurrent expenditures. \n \n9. \nPlanned  fiscal  consolidation.  The government is committed to consolidating its fiscal \nposition,  but  the  speed  of  consolidation  needs  to  be  managed  carefully  to  minimize  possible \nimpacts on poverty and hardship from low economic growth. Consequently, the government has \nrequested  development  partner  support  to  help  mitigate  the  macroeconomic  challenges  and \nbuild  greater  fiscal  resilience.  The  government  has  been  successful  in  reducing  subsidies  to \npublic corporations from 1.5% of GDP in FY2013 to 0.7% of GDP in FY2016. It is intended that \nprivate sector partnerships will further reduce the need for subsidies and facilitate private sector \ngrowth.  Goods  and  services  to  be  procured  in  FY2017  are  budgeted  at  12.5%  of  GDP. \nImprovements  to  procurement  processes  will  help  introduce  efficiencies,  improve  value  for \nmoney in public expenditures, and enhance public service delivery. Significant revenue reforms \nhave  taken  place,  notably  through  the  passage  of  legislation  in  2012.  Samoa\u2019s  Customs \nModernization  Project  is  also  nearing  completion.  These  changes  have  resulted  in  improved \ntaxpayer  compliance  through  increased  awareness  and  enforcement.  Government  fees  and \ncharges  are  being  adjusted  for  inflation,  resulting  in  significantly  improved  nontax  revenue \ncollection. Revenue reforms are not included in the program to allow time for past reforms to be \nimplemented.  Development  partner  support  also  assists  Samoa maintain  an  adequate  level  of \nforeign exchange reserves. \n \n\n                                                \n4  Samoa is currently classified by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as a country at moderate risk \nof  debt distress.  This is  an  improvement  on  the FY2014  rating,  which  rated  Samoa as  being at high  risk  of  debt \ndistress.  International  Monetary  Fund.  2015.  Debt  Sustainability  Analysis.  Staff  Report  for  the  2015  Article  IV \nConsultation. Washington DC. The improvement is largely a result of technical changes, which include the use of a \nlonger-term reference interest rate, revised GDP estimates as a result of rebasing, and inclusion of remittances in \nthe analysis. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fPolitical  commitment  to  reforms.  The  government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to \n10. \nreforms  that  lead  to  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  public  services.  Phase  1  of  the  Public \nFinancial  Management  Reform  Plan  (PFMRP)  was  launched  in  2008,  under  which  aid  policy \nand  debt  management  strategies  were  developed,  outcome-based  budgeting  was  adopted, \nsector  plans  were  prepared,  and  the  Ministry  of  Revenue  was  strengthened.  Phase  2  of  the \nPFMRP  commenced  in  2011,  and  strengthened  internal  audit  functions,  implemented  a  debt \nmanagement reform plan, and developed a medium-term expenditure framework. Following the \n2012 cyclone, the government and development partners worked together to develop an MTFF \nincorporating integrated policies to achieve economic stability. The MTFF specified a clear path \nto  bringing  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  position  to  more  sustainable  levels  over  3\u20135  years,  while \nmaintaining aggregate demand and improving productivity. The MTFF essentially lays the basis \nfor  sustained  economic  growth  through  (i)  support  for  structural  reforms  to  improve  medium-\nterm growth prospects, and (ii) support for mitigation strategies to strengthen climate resilience. \nSamoa is currently implementing phase 3 of its PFMRP. 5  \n \n11. \nProgrammatic approach. The program\u2019s proposed programmatic approach consists of \ntwo  subprograms,  and  is  part  of  the  sequenced  MTFF  reform  process  supported  by \ndevelopment  partners  (including  the  World  Bank,  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New \nZealand,  and  the  European  Union)  to  help  the  government  reduce  debt  and  achieve  fiscal \nconsolidation,  while  focusing  on  reforms  needed  to  build  resilience  and  improve  stability.  The \nprogram  is  consistent  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  assessment  that  finds  fiscal \nconsolidation  is  consistent  with  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  and  that  continued  reforms  will \nhelp  improve  the  business  environment.  It  is  designed  to  augment  ongoing  PFM  reforms  and \nwill  be  delivered  within  the  JPAM.  The  program  policy  matrix  is  a  subset  of  the  JPAM.  The \nJPAM involves regular policy dialogue between the government, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), and other development partners. The two subprograms allow flexibility for the program to \nrespond  to  ongoing  and  new  risks  to  the  economy  and  shifts  in  government  priorities.  The \nprogram  is  consistent  with  the  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa,  2012\u20132016. 6  The \nrequest  for  a  policy-based  operation  in  2016  was  received  during  JPAM  discussions  in  2016, \nand  followed  up  during  the  country  programming  mission  for  the  country  operations  business \nplan, 2017\u20132019.7 \n \nLessons from previous programs. The program builds on the lessons of the Economic \n12. \nRecovery Support Program,8 the Public Sector Financial Management Program (PSFMP),9 and \nADB support for reform around the region. Lessons from these operations have highlighted the \nfollowing  good  practices,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  program  design:  the  need  to \nensure  (i)  political  ownership  and  understanding  of  the  program,  (ii)  that  program-supported \nprocesses  are  mainstreamed  in  PFM  practices,  and  (iii)  that  stakeholders  understand  that \nreforms in a country vulnerable to disasters can take time to become self-sustaining. In Samoa\u2019s \ncontext,  political  ownership  and  understanding  have  been  particularly  necessary  for  reform \nprogress.  The  ongoing  dialogue  under  the  JPAM  processes  ensures  continuing,  coordinated \n                                                \n5  Phase 1 of the PFMRP (2008\u20132011) built on capacity-building initiatives prior to 2008; it was followed by phase 2 \n\n(2012\u20132014) and phase 3 (2015\u20132017). \n www.mof.gov.ws/AboutUs/PublicFinanceManagementReforms/tabid/6008/Default.aspx \n \n6  Government of Samoa. 2012.

The  policy  actions \nattributed to the program are a subset of the JPAM. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe impact will be maintained macroeconomic stability over the medium-term, which is a \nkey objective of the Strategy for the Development of Samoa, 2012\u20132016. The outcome will be \nimproved fiscal resilience. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe program is structured around four reform areas, including (i) reduction of fiscal drain \nthrough  SOE  reforms,  (ii)  improvement  of  procurement  systems,  (iii)  improvement  of  debt \nmanagement, and (iv) promotion of resilience to climate change and variability. Subprogram 1 \nhas  10  policy  actions  while  7  policy  actions  are proposed for  Subprogram  2.  ADB  will  support \nSamoa  through  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for  SOE  reform  and  public  sector \nmanagement during the program. The ADB Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) TA will \nsupport  a  range  of  private  sector  reforms  under  way  in  Samoa  that  include  assistance  for \ndeveloping  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  pipeline. 10  PSDI  will  continue  support  for \nimproving  the  business  regulatory  environment.  Support  for  climate  change  adaptation  and \nmitigation  activities  will  be  guided  by  the  ADB  climate  change  implementation  plan.11 All  the \noutputs are fully aligned with the JPAM, and all policy actions under subprogram 1 have been \ncomplied with prior to the ADB Board of Directors\u2019 consideration of subprogram 1. \n \nOutput  1:  Fiscal  drain  reduced  through  state-owned  enterprise  reform.  SOE \n15. \nreforms have been introduced to improve performance and reduce their dependence on public \nfinances. Subsidies to public corporations in FY2016 are estimated at 0.7% of GDP. Following \nthe  privatization  of  SamoaTel  and  the  establishment  of  a  joint  venture  with  Virgin  Airlines, \nSamoa  has  steadily  reduced  the  number  of  civil  servants  and  elected  officials  to  comply  with \nSchedule  3  of  the  regulations  in  the  Public  Bodies  Act  2001.  The  reform  program  has  made \nsignificant  progress  in  improving  the  governance  structures  of  the  SOEs.  In  April  2014,  a \nminister for public enterprises was appointed with sole responsibility for all SOEs, and a Ministry \nof Public Enterprises (MPE) was established in July 2015. \n \n16. \nThe  government  has  approved  a  PPP  framework  for  collaboration  between  SOEs  and \nthe private sector, and for delivery of selected services. The MPE now has an established PPP \nDivision  with  technical  support  from  ADB.  ADB  will  continue  its  support  for  SOE  reforms  and \nfacilitate  business-enabling  reforms  through  the  regional  PSDI  TA.  PPPs  offer  Samoa  the \npotential to boost opportunities for private sector involvement and investment, while at the same \ntime  driving  improvements  in  asset  maintenance,  operational  efficiency,  and  service  quality \namong  SOEs.  The  government  recognizes  that,  by  facilitating  appropriately  structured \nconcessions  and  inviting  private  sector  participation,  PPPs  can  help  strengthen  SOE \nperformance  and  reduce  the  burden  on  public  finances  over  the  long  term.  PPPs  are  also  a \nmeans  for  the  government  to  attract  more  private  sector  investment  and  skills  into  SOE \noperations. \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2006.

Mainstreaming  Climate  Change  in  ADB  Operations:  Climate  Change  Implementation  Plan  for  the \n\nPacific (2009\u20132015). Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fTo  maintain  the  reform  momentum,  policy  actions  completed  under  subprogram  1 \n17. \ninclude  (i)  cabinet  approval  of  at  least  one  PPP,  (ii)  completion  of  the  Agriculture  Store \nCorporation\u2019s  privatization,  and  (iii)  cabinet  approval  of  a  privatization  and  divestment  policy. \nThe  cabinet  has  endorsed  the  establishment  and  structure  of  the  Samoa  Submarine  Cable \nCompany,  a  PPP  in  the  communication  sector.  ADB  provided  substantial  cofinancing  for \nSamoa\u2019s  broadband  cable  project  and  helped  set  up  the  Samoa  Submarine  Cable  Company, \ninvolving three private sector operators (Digicel, Bluesky, and Computer Services Limited) and \nthree  SOEs  (Unit  Trust  of  Samoa,  the  Samoa  National  Provident  Fund,  and  Samoa  Life \nAssurance Corporation) in a joint venture. The government approved the sale of the Agricultural \nStore Corporation in December 2015; and the sale and purchase agreement was signed in April \n2016,  and  subsequently  executed.  In  2015  the  government  approved  the  Privatization  and/or \nDivestment Policy following a policy review with ADB support. The review found the government \npolicy  on  SOEs  to  be  broadly  appropriate,  but  noted  that  there  should  be  no  differentiation \nbetween  strategic  and  nonstrategic  assets  when  considering  divestment,  nor  should \ncommercially operating trading bodies be owned by the government. \n \nSubprogram 2 will support the establishment of a solid waste management PPP, which \n18. \naims  to  (i)  improve  service  provision,  through  improvements  to  infrastructure  and  compliance \nwith  international  best  practice  relating  to  transportation,  treatment,  and  disposal;  (ii)  ensure \nsolid  waste  management  services  are  provided  to  all  waste  generators  in  Samoa,  including \ncommercial and industrial premises; (iii) facilitate new private sector investment into the sector; \nand  (iv)  introduce  the  \u201cpolluter  pays\u201d  principle  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  and  ensure  no \nreliance  on  public  sector  funding  in  the  long  term.  Subprogram  2  also  intends  to  support \ncompletion of external audits of SOEs in FY2016. \n \n19. \nOutput 2: Improved procurement systems. Strengthening of procurement systems is \nimportant  in  improving  value-for-money  in  public  expenditure  and  enhancing  public  service \ndelivery. Samoa has made substantial progress in reforming public procurement systems during \n2008\u20132015,  and  has  built  the capacity  of the  Ministry  of  Finance (MOF)  procurement  division. \nThe  division  has  spearheaded  reform  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  procurement; \nthe government-approved procurement framework is the basis for instructions, guidelines, and \nstandard  tender  templates  for  minor  works,  minor  goods  and  related  services,  and  minor \ngeneral  services.  Subprogram  1  has  supported  the  issuance  of  standard  tender  templates  for \nmajor works. \n \n20. \nFramework  agreements  enhance  value-for-money  in  procurement  by  pooling  of  similar \nsmall  contracts  over  time  within  and  across  multiple  government  agencies.  Framework \nagreements will enable faster procurement (e.g., of medical or building supplies) in emergency \nsituations.  Pooled  procurement  increases  efficiency  through  economies  of  scale,  and  by \ndecreasing  the  number  of  different  tenders  and  subsequent  workload,  leading  to  considerably \nlower  expenses  for  suppliers  and  consumers.  Further  efficiency  gains  can  be  expected  by \nprequalification of suppliers and products, introducing framework agreements with call-off orders, \nand by tendering required items separately, instead collating them into small lots as is now done. \nThis will promote greater competitiveness among suppliers, resulting in lower prices. \n \n21. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  government  has  included  provisions  in  its  Treasury \nInstructions (Part K) that provide a legal basis for the use of the framework agreement method. \nTo assist the line ministries and SOEs with implementation, the financial secretary subsequently \nissued the Guidelines on Framework Arrangement. Subject to that document and the amended \nTreasury  Instructions,  the  government\u2019s  Tenders  Board  has  revised  its  Guidelines  for \nGovernment  Procurement  and  Contracting:  Goods,  Works  and  General  Services.  This  allows \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fOutput  3: \n\nthe  implementation  of  the  framework  arrangement  method.  To  ensure  the  implementation  of \nthese  reforms,  subprogram  2  will  support  the  pilot  procurement  of  pharmaceutical  items  using \nframework arrangements. It is also intended that subprogram 2 will support the establishment of \na complaints mechanism to further enhance the procurement system. \n \n22. \nImproved  debt  management.  Strengthening  debt  policy  and  debt \nmanagement  remains  a  key  priority,  given  rapid  increases  in  debt  stock  during  FY2009  and \nFY2015.  The  government  has  produced  two  medium-term  debt  management  strategies \n(MTDSs)  (in  2010  and  2013)  and  included  debt  statistics  in  its  official  statistical  releases  for \ngovernment  finances.  In  2014,  the  government  established  formal  procedures  for  contracting \nloans  and  issuing  government  guarantees,  which  were  designed  to  ensure  that  all  loan  and \nguarantee  proposals go through the  same  channels,  are  subject to the  same  level  of  scrutiny, \nand are assessed against the same criteria. This was intended to reduce the chances of loans \nor  guarantees  being  agreed  without  adequate  scrutiny  and  without  complying  with  the  MTDS. \nHowever, there were subsequent increases in non\u2013concessional borrowing. \n \nIn  November  2014,  a  bilateral  loan  agreement  for  CNY340  million  (approximately  $55 \n23. \nmillion, or about 6.6% of 2014 GDP) was signed to fund the upgrade of the airport terminal at \nFaleolo International Airport. The terms of the loan implied a grant element of about 25%, below \nthe  35%  threshold  used  for  assessing  concessionality.  Moreover,  implementation  of  the \nprocedures  for  contracting  loans  occurred  only  after  the  loan  was  signed,  and  an  economic \nanalysis  to  assess  whether  the  project  would  show  a  net  economic  benefit  (as  required  to \nestablish  compliance  with  the  MTDS)  was  prepared  with  a  delay.  To  maintain  focus  and \ncompliance  with  approved  policies,  a  policy  action  for  an  updated  MTDS  following  an \nassessment  of  the  previous  MTDS  has  been  completed  under  subprogram  1.  A  project \neconomic  analysis  training  has  been  delivered  by  ADB  in  September  2016  to  assist  the \ngovernment  with  its  capacity  building.  An  external  debt  management  performance  audit  is \nintended as a policy action under subprogram 2. \n \n24. \nOutput  4:  Resilience  to  climate  change  and  variability  promoted.  Climate  change \nand  variability  have  the  potential  to  have  immediate  and  long-lasting  implications  on  fiscal \nresources.  Possible  economic  implications  on  output  and  productivity  in  climate-sensitive \nsectors such as agriculture and tourism require fiscal responses, particularly following climate-\nrelated disasters. Disasters also affect sensitive coastal areas and stress health and education \nsystems  and  economic  infrastructure.  Disruptions  to  financial  systems  and  trade  also  impact \nfiscal  resources.  Mainstreaming  climate  resilience  in  public  investments  has  the  potential  to \nfacilitate  decisions that may  reduce  long-term fiscal  risks  and  contingent  public  liabilities.  ADB \nhas,  in  the  Public  Sector  Financial  Management  Program  (footnote  9),  supported  the \ndevelopment  of  the  Apia  Town  Spatial  Plan  that  incorporates  climate  change  mitigation \nmeasures.  The  spatial  plan  has  since  been  approved  by  the  government  and  new \ndevelopments have been approved according to the plan. \n \n25. \nThe need to monitor and coordinate a large number of policies and projects associated \nwith building resilience to climate change is now important. Subprogram 1 has supported (i) the \nestablishment of a national monitoring and reporting framework for climate change; and (ii) the \ninclusion of climate risk and resilience indicators in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa, \n2016\u20132020, which is due for finalization in the latter part of 2016. Subprogram 2 will support an \nintegrated  policy  framework  that  allocates  responsibilities  for  resilience  across  government \nagencies;  informs  decisions  to  increase  resilience  across  key  sectors  that  include  agriculture, \nforestry, water, and coastal and urban areas; and will be gender-responsive. It will also support \nthe  development  of  a  strategic  investment  plan  that  identifies  key  national  infrastructure  and \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nprioritizes  risk-reduction  interventions,  thereby  providing  a  basis  for  more  coordinated  climate \nresilience financing. The policy matrix for subprogram 1 is in Appendix 4. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe government has requested a grant of $5.0 million from the Asian Development Fund \nresources  for  subprogram  1.  The  grant  size  (equivalent  to  0.6%  of  FY2017  GDP  estimate)  is \nbased  on  the  estimates  of  budget  financing  requirements  and  the  availability  of  resources  for \nSamoa.  Samoa  is  in  need  of  external  assistance  to  meet  resource  requirements  for  budget \nfinancing,  given  that  economic  recovery  has  been  relatively  weak  following  the  negative \neconomic impact of Tropical Cyclone Evan, and that fiscal consolidation needs to be paced so \nas to not adversely affect growth. The program will be an integral part of a joint undertaking with \nother development partners to provide policy\u2013based support, monitored through the JPAM. The \ntotal value of grants from Samoa\u2019s development partners independent policy\u2013based operations \nare  equivalent  to  1.8%  of  GDP  in  FY2017  and  FY2018.  Without  these  grants,  the  expected \nfiscal deficit in FY2017 would be equivalent to 5.3% of GDP, and likely a similar level in FY2018, \nthus  contributing  to  an  increase  in  public  debt;  if  the  government  were  to  maintain  its  fiscal \ndeficit  target,  expenditure  levels  would  need  to  be  reduced  and  public  services  could  be \ncompromised.  The  FY2017  projected  deficit  will  be  financed  by  concessional  loans  for  the \nAgriculture Sector Support Program (World Bank), the Power Sector Expansion Project (ADB), \nthe  Petroleum  Bulk  Storage  Facility  (Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries),  and \nthe Faleolo International Airport Terminal (China EXIM Bank). \n \n27. \nThe  proposed  ADB  and  parallel  collaborative  partner  financing  (not  administered  by \nADB)  are  indicated  in  Table  2.  The  grant  will  be  released  as  a  single  tranche  of  $5.0  million \nupon grant effectiveness and in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, \nas amended time to time). The government will ensure that the local currency funds generated \nby  the  grant  will  be  used  to  (i)  meet  its financing requirements,  and (ii)  provide  the  necessary \nimpetus for sustained action on critical agreed reforms. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nSubprogram 2 \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nAsian Development Fund (grant) \nAsian Development Fund (loan) \n\nWorld Bank \nAustralia \nNew Zealand \nEuropean Union \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nSubprogram 1 \n \n5.0 \n0.0 \n5.0 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n6.1 \n20.9 \n\n \n0.0 \n5.0 \n5.0 \n2.3 \n2.1 \n7.7 \n22.1 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n11.6 \n11.6 \n23.3 \n10.7 \n10.7 \n32.1 \n100.0 \n\nThe  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  will  oversee  and  coordinate  the  timely \n28. \nimplementation  of  agreed  policy  actions.  The  MOF  will  also  be  responsible  for  program \nadministration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. The MOF and the MPE \nwill be the implementing agencies for the program. The MPE will implement SOE reform outputs, \nwhile the MOF will implement the remaining outputs under the program. The government, ADB, \nand other development partners will participate in at least one annual review of the program by \nJune  2017.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  indicates  the  program \nframework, including the indicative policy actions for subprogram 1. The policy matrix (Appendix \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f4) indicates the policy actions that have been completed for subprogram 1. The JPAM process \nfacilitates  broad  consultations  on  reform  priorities.  Individual  reform  initiatives  form  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s existing reform priorities and are being discussed with the private sector and civil \nsociety  groups  during  program  preparation  and  implementation.  The  program  implementation \nperiod  is  January  2016  to  March  2018.  The  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  from \nJanuary 2016 to March 2017, and for subprogram 2 from April 2017 to March 2018. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n29. \nThe  program\u2019s  major  benefit  will  be  its  contribution  to  Samoa\u2019s  improved  fiscal \nmanagement  and  stability,  which  will  in  turn  help  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  in  the \ncountry  and  sustain  growth.  Strengthened  public  sector  management  and  better-performing \nSOEs will also allow for improved service delivery, which is essential to make growth inclusive \nand to foster employment and poverty reduction. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  envisage  macroeconomic  stability  and \nimproved fiscal resilience, which will reduce the negative impacts of external shocks, including \non  growth  and  service  delivery.  SOE  reforms  are  expected  to  positively  impact  private  sector \ndevelopment and job creation, while reducing the drain on fiscal resources from ineffective and \ninefficient public enterprises. Improved public procurement systems and debt management will \ncontribute  to  building  fiscal  resilience  through  reductions  in  the  government\u2019s  operating  costs. \nMainstreaming  climate  change  in  public  investments  will  contribute  to  reduced  post-disaster \ncosts  in the  long  term. Costs for  policy  reforms  supported  under the  JPAM  are  not  estimated, \nand their impacts are not quantified because of data and capacity constraints. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nPromoting  good  governance  is  a  priority  for  the  government,  which  is  implementing \nphase  3  of  its  PFM  reform  plan  (footnote  5), following  considerable  progress  under  the  earlier \nphases. The government  prepared  phase  3  based  on  the  weaknesses highlighted  in  the  most \nrecent  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  assessment,  carried  out  in  2013.12 The \nplan  also  accounted  for  outstanding  reforms  from  phase  2,  and  actions  identified  during \nconsultations within the government and with development partners through the JPAM process. \nA  high  level  of  ownership  for  the  reforms  is  evident,  and  a  strong  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem now in place. The ADB Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nA stable macroeconomic position and existence of fiscal buffers will reduce the impact of \nexternal  shocks  and  allow  the  government  to  appropriately  respond  to  immediate  needs \nfollowing  disasters,  while  maintaining  basic  social  services.  An  efficient  PFM  has  a  positive \nimpact on service delivery. Private sector development creates employment, which is critical for \naddressing poverty. Subprogram 1 is classified as having no gender elements, with better PFM \nand employment-creation function under the program bringing no specific benefits to women. \n \n\n                                                \n12 PEFA. Samoa 2014. https://pefa.org/sites/default/files/assements/comments/WS-Dec14-PFMPR-Public.pdf \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nD. \n \n33. \nIn  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is \nclassified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nactivities  under  the  program  will  support  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  none  of  the \nactivities  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement,  or  affect  indigenous  peoples  or  the \nenvironment. \n \nE. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 PFM systems are assessed as sound and \nable to reasonably support the implementation of the government\u2019s fiscal policies and delivery of \nservices. Integrated benefits and impacts of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nTable 3: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCommitment to sound macroeconomic \nmanagement and fiscal management weakens \n\nHigh staff turnover diminishes reform \nimplementation capacity \nDelays in technical assistance delivery to \nimplement reforms \nExternal shocks undermine implementation of \nreforms and achievement of program goals \n\nMitigating Measures \nContinuous policy dialogue with the government and \npartners to develop joint expectations and \ncommitments \nTechnical assistance can be provided on a needs \nbasis to supplement capacity \nRegular coordination discussions among \ndevelopment partners to identify and bridge gaps \nContinuous strengthening of the fiscal position to \nrebuild buffers; additional assistance in case of \nshocks \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n35. \nThe  government  and  the  MOF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  grant  documents.
