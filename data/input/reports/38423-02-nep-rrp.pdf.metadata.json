Poverty  incidence  on  average  is  high  for  both \nregions; within the regions, the hill areas suffer particularly high rates of poverty\u2014up to 70% of \nhouseholds fall below the poverty line. Small-farmer incomes are limited by (i) low returns from \ntraditional agricultural commodities, (ii) small and declining farm sizes with low productivity, and \n(iii)  a  supply-driven  production  system  that  has  not  captured  the  potential  market  benefits  for \nHVCs.4  \n \nThe project will help small and medium-sized farmers diversify into HVCs by establishing \n3. \nmarket links; and providing capital for inputs and better technology, and for building postharvest \nvalue chain infrastructure such as storage, packaging, grading, and processing.5 Project grants \nwill  be  provided  to  (i)  small  and  medium  farmers  who  are  members  of  farmer  groups  or \ncooperatives with established market supply agreements for initial inputs and farm technology, \nand (ii) postharvest enterprises for the development of value chain infrastructure to support the \nmarket  supply  agreements.  The  project  will  outsource  service  delivery  to  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private  sector  for  farmer  mobilization,  training,  production,  and \nbusiness planning, and for feasibility studies on access to project funding.  \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n4. \nNepal\u2019s national development priorities are poverty reduction and food security through \neconomic  growth.  The  importance  of  the  agriculture  sector  is  demonstrated  by  the  fact  that \n(i) about 80% of the population lives in rural areas and (ii) around 70% of that rural population is \nengaged  in  agriculture.  Although  agriculture\u2019s  contribution  to  the  gross  domestic  product  has \nfallen  from  72%  in  1975  to  33%  in  2008,  most  rural  people  continue  to  rely  on  agriculture, \nlivestock, and forestry for their livelihoods. Higher economic growth in urban areas has reduced \nurban poverty incidence to 10%, compared with 35% for the rural population. Within the project \nregions\u2019 districts, poverty incidence exceeds 40%, and surveys of small farmers show that more \nthan 65% of households are below the poverty line. As a consequence, men migrate for work, \nand  agriculture  and  the  rural  communities  are  increasingly  feminized.  There  is  minimal \ninvestment by the private sector because of low returns, high business risks arising from conflict \nand political uncertainty, high logistic costs and cost of doing business. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the list of linked documents is in Appendix 2. \n2  Defined as farmers with less than 1 hectare (ha) of land in the hills or less than 3 ha in the Terai. \n3  The  project  districts  in  the  Mid-Western  Development  Region  are:  Banke,  Bardiya,  Dang,  Dhailekh,  and  Surkhe. \nThe project districts in the Far-Western Development Region are: Baitadi, Dadeldhura, Darchula, Doti, and Kailali. \n4  HVCs  are  agricultural  crops  and  other  non-livestock-based  commodities,  such  as  honey,  that  generate  a  higher \n\nrate of return to the farmer per hectare than the production of staple crops such as cereals. \n\n5  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  Nepal for  Preparing  the  Crop  Diversification  and  Commercialization  Project. \n\nManila. The title of the project changed during the implementation of the technical assistance. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAgricultural  productivity  in  Nepal  is  low  by  international  standards  and  in  comparison \n5. \nwith India. The low yields and the declining relative yields reflect underinvestment in inputs and \ninnovation. Where yield advantages exist\u2014for example, in HVCs such as vegetables, fruit, and \nspices\u2014production  growth  occurs.  Agriculture  incomes  are  constrained  by  reliance  on  low-\nvalue,  low-yield  crops  such  as  rice  and  wheat  that  are  grown  to  offset  food  security  risks \n(82% of  the  planted  crop  area).  Farmers  underinvest  and  employ  low  levels  of  technology  on \nsmall  fragmented  plots  of  land,  resulting  in  limited  marketable  output.  Weak  supply  chains, \nlimited access to credit, weak husbandry practices, poor infrastructure, underdeveloped market \nchains,  and  lack  of  services  all  contribute  to  low  productivity,  low  incomes,  and  risk-averse \ndecision making. Increasing climate change impacts from drought and high-intensity rain events \nwill  add  risk  to  farm  systems.  Public  sector  agricultural  services  reach  only  15%  of  farm \nhouseholds.  Microfinance  institutions  withdrew  services  during  the  recent  period  of  conflict, \ncurbing household purchasing power and supply-chain development.   \n \n6. \nWhile trade with India has been growing at an annual rate of 16%, growth in agricultural \ntrade  is  low  owing  to  limited  trade  surplus  and  complex  trade  requirements,  especially  World \nTrade  Organization  regulations  regarding  border  quarantine  certification,  traceability,  and food \nstandard certification. Trade with India is dominated by imports of HVCs, and farm inputs such \nas fertilizers and agricultural chemicals. Regarding fruit, domestic production directly substitutes \nfor declining imports; whereas for vegetables and spices, both domestic production and imports \ncontinue to increase, reflecting growth  in demand  and off-season  export  opportunities.  Annual \ndomestic urban demand is estimated at 105,000 tons for fruit; 92,000 tons for vegetables; and \n7,400 tons for spices. Annual export demand is estimated at 736,100 tons for fruit; 683,954 tons \nfor vegetables; and 119,000 tons for spices.6 While there is unsatisfied domestic demand, local \nproduction  can  create  selling  risks  through  oversupply  and  distressed  sales,  especially  during \npeak production season.7   \n \n7. \nSignificant  opportunities  in  agriculture  include  (i)  greater  demand  for  HVCs  as  urban \nincomes increase; (ii) added demand for HVCs from continued growth in the tourism sector; and \n(iii)  production  and  processing  of  high-value  off-season  products.  Key  market  opportunities \ninclude substituting for the import of HVCs such as fruit and vegetables, and exporting to India \nand  regional  markets  products  with comparative  advantage.  Nepal  is currently  unable  to meet \nWorld Trade Organization  border  compliance  requirements  that  will  limit  the  export  of  Nepal\u2019s \nagricultural products.8 \n \n8. \nGovernment policy aims to improve productivity in the  agriculture sector as a driver for \neconomic growth. The objectives of the National Agricultural Policy (2004) are (i) an increase in \nproductivity,  (ii)  expansion  of  commercial  agricultural  production,  and  (iii)  promotion  of \nsustainable  natural  resource  management.  To  achieve  commercial  agricultural  objectives,  the \npolicy  and  its  supporting  agricultural  perspective  plan  propose:  (i)  development  of  market-\nbased,  large-production  pockets  to  achieve  economies  of  scale  in  production  and  marketing;                \n(ii)  promotion  of  market-based,  high-value  commercial  agricultural  production  along  major \nhighways  and  north\u2013south  road  corridors;  (iii)  provision  of  incentives  for  educated  youths  to \nengage  in  agribusinesses;  (iv)  promotion  of  export-based  organic  farming;  (v)  protection  of \nindigenous knowledge and technologies in agriculture; and (vi) promotion of cooperative farming \nand marketing of agricultural products. \n\n                                                \n6  Netherlands  Development  Organisation.  2010.

The  country \npartnership  strategy 9  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identifies  the  agriculture  and \nnatural resource sector as a priority sector. The project, while complimenting on-going initiatives \nin the rural  sector,  including those  in  irrigation,  rural  infrastructure,  commercial  agriculture and \nrural  finance,10 will  continue  to  facilitate  diversification  and  commercialization  of  agriculture  in \nregions with highest poverty levels in Nepal. And will contribute to enhanced  food security and \npoverty  reduction  by  supporting  the  transition  of  the  rural  poor  and  socially  excluded  groups \nfrom a largely subsistence economy to a commercial one.    \n \n10. \nThe project design responds to key lessons accumulated in the sector, including greater \ncoordination  with  other  sectors,  partnership  with  nongovernment  organizations,  catalyzing \nprivate  sector  investments,  establishing  strategic  market  linkages  and  institutionalizing  impact \nevaluation processes. The design is also aligned with initiatives by other development partners \nsupporting  commercialization  of  agriculture.  These  include  the World  Bank-funded  Agricultural \nCommercialization and Trade Project, and the International Fund for Agriculture Development-\nfunded High Value Agriculture in Hill and Mountain Areas Project. Technical expertise supported \nby  the  Netherlands  Development  Organisation  (SNV)  and  other  rural  initiatives  with  synergy \npotential are included in project awareness and training activities.   \n \nThe project contributes to level 1 of ADB\u2019s results framework by boosting rural incomes, \n11. \nreducing poverty and increasing food security in Nepal (ADB targets 17.14% of the Asia\u2013Pacific \npopulation living on less than $1 per day by 2015); under the project, over 45,000 individuals will \nmove above this threshold. ADB\u2019s level 2 country outcome performance targets are addressed \nfarmer \nby  providing  project  grants \ncooperatives;  the  project  will  support  an  estimated  220  enterprises  and  890  farmer  groups \n(ADB\u2019s  target  is  to  support  54,000  enterprise  accounts).  The  project  contributes  to  the  level  3 \noperational targets through development of the private sector in the poorer parts of rural Nepal \n(ADB\u2019s  target  is  for  private  sector  involvement  in  30%  of  projects)  and  gender  mainstreaming \n(ADB\u2019s  target  is  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  40%  of  projects).  The  implementation  modality \nbuilds strong partnerships with NGOs (ADB\u2019s target is for NGO inclusion in 80% of projects).  \n \nB. \n\nto  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises, \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nincluding \n\n12. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  greater  profitability  of  small  and  medium-sized  farmers  in \n10 project  districts.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  increased  production  of  HVCs  by  small \nand  medium-sized  farmers  (footnote  1).  By  2017,  the  7,500  hectares  (ha)  of  contracted  HVC \nproduction will achieve an estimated annual output of 64,500 tons with a projected retail value of \n$31.0 million; farm-gate value of $13.5 million; and a gross margin to farmers of $9.5 million per \nannum. Since HVC production falls into the domain of women, the project will increase women\u2019s \ncash  income.  The  project  is  expected  to  benefit  an  estimated  18,700  farm  households  that \nwould  grow  HVC  crops  on  the  average  in  0.4  ha  for  existing  farmers  and  0.25  ha  for  the \ndisadvantaged persons.11  \n  \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2009.

To achieve output 1, the project will establish a \nfacility  to  provide  grants  to  beneficiaries  to  invest  in  (i) postharvest  facilities  and  support  for \nfarmer  cooperatives;  (ii)  essential  inputs  for  HVC  production;  and  (iii) selected  essential  farm \ntechnology,  including  for  climate  change  adaptation,  all  of  which  will  benefit  disadvantaged \npersons  including  indigenous peoples,  and  households  headed  by  women  that  are  involved  in \nthe  production  and  marketing  of  HVCs.  Grants  will  be  given  to  successful  applicants  upon \nreview  by  an  independent  advisory  panel 12 and  approval  by  the  project  director.  The  grant \neligibility  criteria  and  approval  process  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual \n(PAM).13 The provision of grants to beneficiaries is justified by the observed market failure in the \nagribusiness investments and the cost of doing business in the project regions: (i) high logistical \ncosts, and (ii) political and business risks, including the costs of aggregating supply. \n \nOutput  2:  Business  plans  for  producing,  and  adding  value  to,  high-value \n15. \ncommodities.  The project will (i) provide postharvest enterprises with HVCs and agribusiness \ntraining,  supplier  agreements,  and  support  for  formulating  business  plans;  (ii)  develop  and \ndisseminate agriculture market information; (iii) use market supply agreements, build integrated \nmarket  chains  linking  buyers  to  farmer  cooperatives,  and  cooperatives  to  farmer  groups,  with \nsupporting  production  plans;  (iv)  open  up  access  to  on-farm  services,  technical  support \n(including  climate  change  adaptation),  and  production  planning  services  to  build  capacity  of \nsmall and medium farmers; (v) support HVC producers by strengthening the capacity of district \nagriculture  development  offices,  community  agricultural  service  centers,  and  agricultural \nresource  centers  to  respond  to  the  needs,  constraints,  and  opportunities  of  disadvantaged \npersons,  indigenous  peoples,  and  women;  and  (vi)  mobilize  existing  and  new  groups  of \ndisadvantaged farmers with predominantly female members. \n  \n16. \nOutput  3:  Effective  and  efficient  project  management.  Output  3  will  be  achieved \nthrough  project  management  and  administration,  and  by  ensuring  the  efficient  and  effective \nimplementation of the project by the project management unit (PMU) in Nepalgunj and a liaison \nto  support  project \noffice \nmanagement,  technical  backstopping  for  HVC  value  chain  development  and  on-farm  HVC \nproduction.

Applications  will  be  reviewed  by  the  independent  advisory  panel \nthat  will  advise  the  PMU  of  eligibility.  The  PMU  shall  prepare  guidelines  for  the  submission  of \ngrant  applications,  including  monthly  deadlines  and  timelines  for  panel  meeting  dates.  Grant \neligibility  criteria  are  provided  in  the  PAM.  Once  an  application  is  approved,  the  applicant  will \nenter  into  a  contract  with  NRB  and  DOA  pursuant  to  which  funds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \napplicant.  Applicants  will  procure  according  to  commercial  practices  and  provide  procurement \ndocumentation to the PMU for review. Upon proof of eligibility, the PMU will instruct the NRB to \nadvance  funds  in  installments  to  the  beneficiary\u2019s  bank  account.  Should  the  advisory  panel \nfindings  be  disregarded,  the  project  director  must  obtain  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  before  any \ncontract or disbursement is undertaken. For all grants over $100,000 the project director must \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fobtain ADB\u2019s prior approval. The PMU will aim for beneficiaries to receive the first installment of \nadvance from NRB within 30 days of approval by the advisory panel and upon submission of the \npurchase  order.  The  balance  funds  will  be  released  to  the  beneficiary  bank  account  upon \nsubmission of the sales invoice and liquidation of the earlier advance. Funds used for ineligible \nexpenditures  must  be  immediately  refunded  to  ADB.  A  performance  target  is  set  that  90%  of \nsuccessful  applications  will  receive  disbursements  within  30  days  of  approval.  ADB,  in \nconsultation  with  the  government,  reserves  the  right  to  reassign  fund  management  if \nperformance  targets  are  not  achieved  on  a  quarterly  basis.15 ADB  also  reserves  the  right  to \nreview all documentation related to the agribusiness grant facility. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Business  Plans  for  Producing,  and  Adding  Value to,  High-Value \nCommodities in the Project Regions \n\n21. \nActivities for output 2 will be implemented by AEC and service providers contracted for \nHVC supply. AEC will also implement the securing of markets. AEC\u2019s role provides (i) access to \nthe  700 members  of the  Federation  of  Nepalese  Chambers  of  Commerce and  Industry,  which \ninclude domestic agribusiness enterprises, (ii) local presence in the two regions and 10 project \ndistricts,  which  will  be  strengthened  and  sustained  beyond  the  project,  and  (iii)  access  to \nagribusiness  capacity-building  products  that  the  AEC  can  supply  to  project  beneficiaries.  AEC \nwill implement market-linking programs, HVC market network promotion, and the development \nof knowledge products. AEC will support the PMU in procuring training services for postharvest \nenterprises,  and  other  related  tasks  such  as  service  provider  prequalification  procedure,  and \nreviewing  local  service  provider  business  plans  and  grant  applications.  AEC  will  expand  its \nagricultural market information system to the project districts. Office facilities and equipment will \nbe procured through shopping while staff costs will be considered implementation costs.  \n \n22. \nTo secure supply from farmer groups with market agreements, the PMU will contract a \nnational service provider through the quality- and cost-based selection procedures for technical \nsupport, overall quality control, and supervision of local service providers. The national service \nprovider  will  develop  training  programs,  apply  quality  control  to  local  service  providers,  and \nensure training for and awareness of the project grant eligibility and application process. At the \ndistrict  level,  the  PMU  will  contract  local  NGO  services.  These  service  providers  will  deliver \nsocial  mobilization,  HVC  awareness  and  training  programs,  and  planning  assistance  that \nenables  farmer  groups  to  access  project  grants  for  inputs  to  HVC  production.  The  project, \nthrough  separate  NGO  contracts,  will  set  up  as  many  as  90  farmer  groups  among \ndisadvantaged  persons.  These  contracts  include  provision  for  mobilization,  access  to  project \ntraining and project grants, and the leasing of land for 1.5 years (three crop seasons) to groups \nof landless farmers. \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n23. \nThe  project  benefits  will  (i)  boost  incomes  of  small  and  medium  farmers  from  HVC \nproduction and increase cropping intensity by 16%; (ii) provide additional employment\u2014on-farm \nhired labor will increase by about 6,180 jobs per year;16 postharvest employment is estimated to \nbe about 4,130 jobs per year, of which aout 1,830 are unskilled; and (iii) strengthen capacity of \nrural  enterprises  and  farmer  cooperatives  through  value  addition  within  HVC  value  chains. \n                                                \n15 This  requirement  reflects  sector  experience  with  delays  of  such  disbursements  and  also  highlights  the  critical \nnature of timely availability of inputs for HVCs, which have short growing seasons defined by market opportunities \nand/or climatic conditions.  \n\n16 One full-time equivalent is assumed to be 200 paid days per year. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nProject  beneficiaries  will  be  an  estimated  18,700  producers  of  HVCs (Economic and Financial \nAnalysis, Appendix 2). \n\n24. \nFarmers  diversifying  into  HVC  production  will  have  higher  incomes.  Small-farmer \nincomes per household are estimated to rise by NRs5,380 in the Terai (an increase of 17%) and \nby  NRs8,780  in  the  hills  (a  68%  increase).  Medium-sized  farm  incomes  per  household  are \nestimated to increase by NRs22,130 in the Terai and by NRs34,690 in the hills\u2013to three times \ntheir current levels. A sample of potential value chain investments was assessed in financial and \neconomic  analysis,  and  all  are  deemed  financially  and  economically  viable.  The  financial \ninternal rates of return range from 12% to 30% compared with an estimated weighted average \ncost  of  capital  of  4.7%. 17  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  range  from  14%  to  30%, \naveraging  23%  for  the  indicative  postharvest  investments.  Inclusion  of  farmer  output  benefits, \nand project implementation and management costs results in a project economic internal rate of \nreturn of 21%.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n25.  MOAC has experience in implementing ADB and donor programs. Project measures to \nenhance governance and prevent corruption during implementation include (i) establishment of \ntransparent  procedures  for  financial  transactions;  (ii)  the  use  of  private  providers  to  undertake \ndue diligence during business planning and the review of this by the national service providers; \n(iii)  the  inspection  of  a  sample  of  project  grants  for  the  first  2  years  by  staff  from  district \nagriculture development offices; (iv) the review of grant proposals by the independent advisory \npanel,  with  prior  ADB  approval  for  grants  of  more  than  $100,000;  (v)  stakeholders\u2019  annual \nprogress  evaluations;  and (vi)  the  PMU\u2019s  reporting  of  all  project  activities  and  related financial \nstatements to the public on its website.18 \n\n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOAC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.19 \n\nC. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n \n\n27. \nThe  project  supports  the  agriculture  sector  and  ties  in  with  Nepal\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy  by  contributing  to  poverty  alleviation.  The  project  is  estimated  to  benefit  18,700  farm \nhouseholds in the project regions, which have the highest incidence of poverty in the country.20 \nThe headcount measure of poverty incidence is 45% in the Mid-Western Development Region \nand 41% in the Far-Western Development Region, compared with  a national average of 31%. \nThe project promotes the inclusion of women and disadvantaged persons, such as marginalized \nand small indigenous farmers, to ensure benefits deliver inclusive growth. The majority of farm \nhouseholds (65%) in the project regions have food deficits, and an estimated 1 in 3 households \nis rated as food insecure.21  A poverty reduction and social strategy, a gender equity and social \ninclusion  (GESI)  plan,  and  an  indigenous  peoples  assessment  and  measures  have  been \n\n                                                \n17 Postharvest  indicative  investments  include  multi-commodity  on-farm  storage,  collection,  cool  storage,  and \n\n18 Nepal  Post-Conflict  Sensitive  Approach:  A  Peace  Building  Tool  (Peace  Filter)  for  Project  Design  and \n\ncommodity-specific processing. \n\nImplementation (Appendix 2). \n\n19 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n20 The data used in this paragraph is taken from  Central Bureau of Statistics. 2004.

Socio-economic and Gender Analysis Report, Consolidated and Management Services Nepal (P) Ltd. \n\n\fprepared. 22  The  GESI  plan  for  the  project  has  three  themes:  (i)  mainstreaming  of  gender \nempowerment in recognition of women\u2019s prevalence in agricultural work and of the potential for \nHVC production, processing, and marketing to further reduce the gender gaps; (ii) a program to \ninclude  disadvantaged  persons,  such  as  help  to  access  services,  capital,  and  land;  and \n(iii) capacity building of project stakeholders to understand the differing needs, constraints, and \nopportunities of indigenous peoples and disadvantaged persons, and the gender impacts. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n \n\n28. \nAn  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  for  the  project  has  been \nprepared, and the disaster and climate change risk screen applied.23 The project is classified as \ncategory  FI.  Screening  procedures  have  been  established  under  the  ESMS  to  ensure  that  all \nsubprojects  financed  under  the  project  meet  ADB  requirements  specified  in  Safeguard \nRequirements  1-3.  The  eligibility  for  project  grant  funds  excludes  investments  that  fall  under \nenvironment  category  A.  Possible  adverse  impacts  of  project  activities  are  expected  to  be \nreversible,  site-specific,  and  small  in  magnitude.  The  PMU,  AEC,  and  the  national  on-farm \nservice  provider  will  be  responsible  for  the  ESMS,  implementing  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism, implementing the monitoring plan, and reporting progress to MOAC and ADB.  \n\n \n\n29. \nThe  gender  strategy,  articulated  in  the  GESI  plan,  also  includes  a  strategy  for  social \ninclusion of indigenous peoples and disadvantaged persons. The social impacts are expected to \nbe  positive,  especially  regarding  participation  by  women,  disadvantaged  persons,  and \nindigenous  peoples,  and  their  access  to  project opportunities  and benefits. The  previous  Crop \nDiversification  Project  demonstrated  the  benefits  for  women  and  disadvantaged  persons  of \nintroducing  HVCs,  and  it  is  envisaged  that  75%  or  more  of  farmer  group  members  will  be \nfemale.  The  project  will  provide  specifically  designed  programs  to  work  with  disadvantaged \npersons and indigenous peoples to ensure their opportunity to benefit is achieved. The  project \nis unlikely to trigger any involuntary resettlement safeguards. However, as  subprojects are not \nknown at this stage and are stakeholder driven, a resettlement framework has been included in \nthe  ESMS24 which  outlines  the  triggers  for,  and  indicative  content  of,  a  resettlement  plan,  in \ncase  one  is  needed.  Two  full-time  positions  are  included  in  the  PMU  for  applying  social \nsafeguards. \n \nE. \n\nRisk and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks and mitigating measures developed in the risk assessment and risk management \n\n30. \nplan are summarized in Table 4.25  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Main Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate attention to effective \nproject management may \nadversely impact implementation   \n\nMitigating Measures \nProject  implementation  will  use  service  providers,  including  AEC,  with \ntechnical backstopping from SNV and NGO service providers to offset human \nresource  weakness  and  reduce  risk  of  inadequate  government  funding \nsources. \n\n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Gender and Social Inclusion Plan, and Environmental and Social \n\nManagement System Arrangement (Appendix 2). \n\n23 Environmental  and  Social  Management  Arrangement, and Disaster  and  Climate  Change  Risk  Screening  Results \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n24 No resettlement is envisaged under the project.
