THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jilin Urban Development Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will address urgent infrastructure needs, introduce best practices, and pilot \ninnovative municipal services solutions to develop Baishan and Baicheng cities in Jilin Province \n(in the northeast region of the PRC) as livable and resource-efficient medium-sized cities. It will \nmake provision for (i) urban roads and municipal services in Baicheng that promote people-\ncentered urban transport; (ii) the introduction of integrated solid waste management (ISWM) in \nboth  cities,  based  on  the  reduce,  reuse,  recycle  (3R)  principle  that  includes  composting \nsolutions;  and  (iii)  improvement  of  water  supply  services  in  Baishan,  emphasizing  water \nconservation, water supply safety, and energy efficiency.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  PRC\u2019s  National  New  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020  aims  to  increase  the \nurbanization rate from the current 54% to 60% by 2020 (representing about 100 million new \nurban residents), and to 70% by 2030 (equal to about 300 million new urban residents).3 \nUrbanization  is  perceived  as  a  means  to  sustain  economic  growth  through  domestic \nconsumption,4 and  to  achieve  more  balanced  development  by  directing  the  future  urban \npopulation away from large cities.5 The strategy focuses on the development of medium-sized \ncities (in which more than one-third of the urban population lives) as an important means of \nabsorbing future urban residents in a sustainable, inclusive, and efficient manner.6 These cities \nhave the potential to generate sufficient economies of scale to cluster local economic activities, \nwhile their proximity to the rural population supports rural and urban integration,7 and balances \nthe development of industry and job markets nationally and in each province. Although they \nbenefit  from  some  advantages,8 they  suffer  from  a  deficit  of  infrastructure  and  municipal \nservices,  resulting  in  environmental  pollution  and  constrained  economic  development. The \ncapacity of medium-sized cities to pilot, implement, and replicate efficient urban infrastructure \nand municipal service delivery best practices will play an essential role in the quality and \nlivability of the country\u2019s urban development. \n \n4.  Development in Jilin Province is centered in the cities of Changchun and Jilin, and \nimprovements  barely  reach  the  remote,  less-developed  prefectures  in  the  southeast  and \nnorthwest,  where  Baishan  (480,000  residents)  and  Baicheng  (330,000  residents)  cities, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the  Jilin Urban Services \nImprovement Development Project. Manila (TA 8172-PRC).  \n3  Staff Council of the PRC. 2014. National New Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020. Beijing. \n4  Domestic consumption accounted for 36% of the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product in 2011; by comparison, it \naccounted for 72% in the United States, 65% in the United Kingdom, and 59% in India. The PRC\u2019s domestic \nmarkets are perceived to have the potential to sustain economic growth even if the global economy stagnates. \n5  Most large or mega cities in the PRC face significant challenges relating to the environment and congestion (e.g., \nescalating housing prices, traffic gridlock, extensive air and water pollution, water scarcity, and overcrowding). \n6  A medium-sized city has a population of 0.2\u20131.0 million. \n7  On 15 November 2013, the decisions by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China indicated that \nurbanization and reform of the hukou (household registration) system should focus on small- and medium-sized \ncities, while migration to the large and mega cities should be strictly controlled. \n8  Such as lower living costs, healthier environments, household registration system reforms, proximity to large rural \npopulations, and lower land costs. ", "2 \nrespectively, are located.9 The Jilin provincial government (JPG) has formulated a strategy that \nprioritizes development of the two cities, seeking to increase economic activity, decrease the \npoverty rates in their respective areas,10 and balance development within the province. \n \n5.  Critical  infrastructure  gaps  that  prevent  sustainable  development  of  Baichang  and \nBaishan  cities  have  been  identified.  Residential  areas  in  western  Baicheng\u2014the  Baicheng \nEconomic Development Zone (BEDZ)\u2014have grown without proper access to central municipal \nservices.  An  estimated  25,000  residents  are  not  yet  connected  to  the  central  wastewater \ntreatment plant, and discharge wastewater into the surrounding environment or into unimproved \nseptic tanks. A rational road network is absent within the BEDZ to provide adequate urban \nservices to the existing population, properly connects the area to the rest of Baicheng, and \nfacilitate  the  development  of  mixed-function  areas  to  accommodate  future  residents  and \neconomic activities. The city\u2019s current road design allows little room for promoting public and \nnonmotorized transport.  \n \n6.  The current daily generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) is 420 wet tons per day \n(t/d) in Baicheng and 330 wet t/d in Baishan. In Baicheng, a new sanitary landfill is under \nconstruction. In Baishan, the existing landfill is being rehabilitated and will reach its maximum \ncapacity in 3 years. In the two cities, solid waste management relies on \u201ctruck and dump\u201d \noperations, with little consideration for 3R principles, and limited disposal options. This results in \npollution and inefficient use of waste resources.  \n \n7.  Baishan\u2019s water supply has reached its full capacity and cannot ensure 24-hour water \nservices. Currently, 30% of the population (144,000 people) lacks full-time access to water. The \nrecent  decline  in the quality  and  quantity  of the  main  water  source (Dayangcha  River)  in \nJiangyuan  district  combined  with  the  growing  population  of  Hunjiang  district  are  putting \nBaishan\u2019s water supply safety at significant risk. Previously inadequate technical standards, \naging pipes, and poor water supply dispatching efficiency have resulted in nonrevenue water \n(NRW) in Baishan reaching 65%; this in turn has caused inefficient water use, loss of income, \nand excessive energy consumption. \n \n8.  Strategic fit. While addressing priority infrastructure gaps, the project aims to promote \nbest international practices and enhance investment proposals for long-term, resource-efficient, \nand  environmentally  compliant  solutions.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  ADB  country \npartnership strategy and ADB\u2019s urban and water operational plans, 2011\u20132020.11 It is also in \nline with the National New Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020 and the government\u2019s Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan as it supports (i) balanced urbanization with development of cities that are livable, \nconserve resources, and are inclusive; and (ii) the sector objective of improving and piloting \nbest practices with respect to water, solid waste, and municipal services.12 Finally, the project \ncontinues the long-term strategic partnership that ADB has built through multiple investments to \n                                                \n9  Baishan City population is projected to reach 700,000 by 2020. Baicheng City population is projected to reach \n600,000 in 2020. \n10 The two cities and their surrounding rural areas have some of the highest poverty rates in the province. \n11 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n12 For example, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan direction for solid waste management indicates that classified collection, \ntransport, and treatment of organic waste in the cities at or above prefecture level should be promoted. Model cities \nfor domestic solid waste classification should focus on wet and/or dry classification of household garbage. If \napplicable, organic waste will be collected separately and recycled. \n ", "3 \ndecrease urban pollution and support more balanced urban development in Jilin Province, the \nSonghua river basin, and the Yalu river basin.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be improved economic growth, resource efficiency, and quality of life in \nBaicheng and Baishan cities. The outcome will be improved delivery and efficiency of municipal \nservices in Baicheng and Baishan cities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.

Comprising (1) \nsupport for project implementation and management, institutional strengthening, \ncapacity  development,  and  training;  (2)  institutional  capacity  development \nsupport  for  water  management,  community-led  waste  sorting  and  recycling, \npeople-centered  urban  transport,  traffic  management  and  safety,  and  public-\nawareness campaigns; and (3) external resettlement monitoring. \n \n11.  Special features and value addition. The project will promote people-centered urban \ntransport in Baicheng. The provision of lanes dedicated to buses and nonmotorized traffic, \nsupported by a capacity development program, will initiate change in the transport planning \nsystem and promote the extension of low-carbon transport. The project will also introduce a \nmore systematic and efficient use of public buses. It will implement a traffic management and \ncontrol system, traffic safety measures, and a public-awareness campaign to help improve \ntraffic  safety  and reduce  traffic congestion.  The  project  will  also  pilot  curbside  stormwater \ncollection and local infiltration, which has the potential to significantly reduce water logging and \npollution.15  \n \n12.  The solid waste management systems in Baicheng and Baishan cities will be developed \ninto ISWM systems16 through a plan that defines step-by-step solutions for each type of waste. \nThe project will pioneer an MSW composting program in a medium-sized city.17 At-source \nsegregation  will  be  established  in  selected  communities18 and  recycling  activities  will  be \nmaximized  by  providing  collection  points  for  materials  such  as  glass,  metal,  clothes,  and \nconstruction waste. Education and public awareness campaigns, and community-based solid \nwaste management will be implemented to ensure the sustained operation and impact of the \ninfrastructure improvements. \n \n13.  The establishment of a resource-efficient and safe water supply system in Baishan will \nbe achieved by supporting (i) reduction of NRW from 65% to 35%, by addressing water leakage, \nunbilled uses, and commercial losses; (ii) improvements in operations and energy efficiency by \naddressing engineering, automation and monitoring, and operation and maintenance (O&M); (iii) \nwater supply safety, through the implementation of a water safety plan based on water quality \nmonitoring and assurance systems;19 (iv) financial sustainability through tariff reform to achieve \nfull cost recovery; and (v) an education campaign to raise water conservation awareness. 20 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $386.84 million (Table 1), of which 44.3% of the base \ncost will finance civil works, 16.5% for mechanical and equipment, and 0.8% for consultants. \nThe government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance the project. The loan will (i) have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \n                                                \n15 Water logging refers to temporary urban flooding. This results from urban drainage system overflows caused by \nincreased surface sealing in cities. \n16 ISWM integrates (i) stakeholders; (ii) technical elements of waste reduction, reuse and recycling, collection, and \ndisposal; and (iii) sociocultural, environmental, institutional, political, and legal issues. \n17 Currently, composting represents less than 5% of MSW treatment undertaken in the PRC, and is virtually unknown \nin medium-sized cities. \n18 Representing 20% of the population of the two cities.  \n19 Water  conservation  and  implementation  of  a  water  safety  plan  is  based  on  World  Health  Organization \nmethodology, and aims to avoid the limitations associated with relying on end-product testing as a means of water \nsafety control. \n20 A road map for sector improvement in each city is in Appendix 4 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nyears; (ii) use the annuity repayment method, with a 10% discount factor; (iii) have an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; (iv) have a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and (v) have such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 18.31 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20%. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nItem  Amount ($ million)a  Share of Total (%) \nA.

The PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available, through Jilin \nprovincial government, to Baicheng and Baishan city governments on the same terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. The project city governments will assume the foreign \nexchange and interest variation risks of the ADB loan. The governments assured ADB that \ncounterpart funding will be provided in a timely manner, including any additional counterpart \n ", "6 \nfunding required for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns. The indicative flow of funds and the \nrelending and onlending arrangements are in the project administration manual (PAM).21 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.

Two sub-PMOs will be established to manage day-to-day \nactivities  and  provide  coordination  support  for  subproject  implementation:  Baicheng \nMunicipality PMO, headed by the director of BEDZ Investment and Development; and \nBaishan Municipality PMO, headed by the director of the housing and construction bureau. \n(iv)  Implementation  The three project implementation units are government-owned entities that will report to the \nunit  respective municipal government: (i) BEDZ Investment and Development will report to \nBCMG (12 staff proposed), (ii) Baishan Solid Waste Disposal will report to BSMG (49 staff \nproposed), and (iii) Baishan Xibeicha Qiyuan Hydropower will report to BSMG (27 staff \nproposed).  The  PIUs  will  carry  out  day-to-day  implementation,  including  engineering \nsupervision and procurement of goods and civil works. \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  20 contracts  $131.8 million \nNational competitive bidding  19 contracts  $95.4 million \nConsulting services  Consultants qualification selection  1 contract  $0.15 million \nQuality- and cost-based selection   174.5 person-months  $2.85 million \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting will require three packages (two for consulting services and one for \nand/or advance  goods). Advance contracting and retroactive financing will require six civil works contracts. \ncontracting  Retroactive financing will finance up to $30 million of eligible expenditures (20% of the ADB \nloan) incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months prior to signing of \nthe loan agreement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BCMG  =  Baicheng  Municipal  Government,  BEDZ  =  Baicheng  Economic \nDevelopment Zone, BSMG = Baishan Municipal Government, JDRC = Jilin Development and Reform Commission, \nJFB = Jilin Finance Bureau, JHUDD = Jilin Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development Department, PLG = Project \nLeading Group, PMO = Project Management Office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Technical  due  diligence  of  the  project  component  included  comparative  analyses; \nassessed technical specifications, sustainability, and design methods; and ensured standards \ncomply with relevant PRC engineering guidelines and local regulations, as well as specific local \nconditions.  The  3R  principle  was  discussed  and  incorporated  in  the  MSW  management \nproposal to address waste reduction, sorting-at-source, recycling, and reuse of compost. The \nwater supply component engineering design will facilitate O&M by optimizing energy efficiency, \nmonitoring, and control systems; and reduce NRW. A people-centered transport system has \nbeen incorporated to promote nonmotorized transport, traffic safety, and public transportation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  The economic analysis evaluated the technical options, confirmed the economic viability \nof the project, and confirmed that the chosen engineering options are the least-cost options. The \ncost\u2013benefit analysis reveals an overall economic internal rate of return of 16%, and overall \neconomic net present value of CNY553.9 million. The economic internal rate of return for each \ncomponent is computed at 16.0% for improved municipal services in Baicheng, 15.1% for \nBaishan ISWM, and 16.0% for Baishan improved water supply service; each exceeds the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project\u2019s \neconomic return is robust against negative impacts.22 \n \n20.  The analysis of the financial viability of the  project\u2019s cost-recovery component (i.e., \nimproved water supply management in Baishan) finds the financial internal rate of return to be \n5.82%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  2.58%  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The \nfinancial analysis is based on a stepped tariff plan that aims at full cost recovery in the long \nterm,  and  takes  the  form  of  an  increasing  block  tariff,  or  volumetric  tariffs.23 Financial \nsustainability analysis indicates that the proposed project components entail acceptable fiscal \nrisk  regarding  the  ability  of  both  Baicheng  Municipal  Government  (BCMG)  and  Baishan \nMunicipal Government (BSMG) to provide counterpart funds for capital investment, financing of \nO&M costs, and to service project debts. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith JPG, BCMG, and BSMG. The financial management assessment concludes that, although \nthe implementing agencies have adequate financial management capacity, measures will be \nimplemented  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  meet  the  project\u2019s  financial  management \nrequirements. The procurement capacity assessment concludes that Jilin provincial PMO has \nstrong experience managing ADB projects in accordance with ADB policies and procedures, as \nwell as national laws and regulations. The implementing agencies and PIUs lack experience \nwith ADB or foreign-funded projects. The implementing agencies and PIUs will work under the \nguidance of Jilin provincial PMO and will receive adequate knowledge and training support for \nprocurement from an experienced procurement agent, and through the project implementation. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n                                                \n22 The economic internal rate of return remained above 12% even under a scenario that combined a (i) 10% \nreduction in project benefits, (ii) 10% cost overrun, and (iii) project implementation delay of 1 year. \n23 This is in line with water conservation guidances issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and \nthe Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development, which include water volumetric quotas, updated per region. \n ", "8 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  The project will benefit directly 786,000 people, including 86,500 low-income residents. \nThe urban poverty rates of both cities are higher than the provincial average (12.5% in Baishan \nand 10.2% in Baicheng, versus an average of 6.0% for the Jilin Province). Poor infrastructure \nand services were identified as critical constraints to economic and social development. It is \nestimated that a total of more than 22,600 person-months of construction employment will be \ncreated by the project; most jobs will be filled by local people, including the local poor, and at \nleast 30% will be provided to women. The implementing agencies will ensure that all PRC labor \nlaws and core labor standards are followed. Details on specific measures to ensure the poverty \nand social benefits are in the social action plan included in the PAM. \n  \n23.  Social and gender action plans were prepared for the project to ensure the participation \nof communities in managing the cities\u2019 urban areas. Actions include (i) implementation of traffic \nsafety and water conservation-awareness programs; (ii) monitoring of public participation in the \npublic hearing process for water tariffs; and (iii) targets for employment of local labor, women, \nand the poor during construction and implementation. In addition, the creation of community-\nbased  waste  management  groups  and  outreach  to  schools  will  help  ensure  the  waste \nmanagement infrastructure improvement impacts are sustainable. Social and gender indicators \nwill be included in the project performance management system, and appropriate consultant \ninputs  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of  both  plans  are  included  in  the  supervision \nconsultant package.24 \n \n24.  Gender.  The  project  has  been  designed  to  be  classified  \u201ceffective  gender \nmainstreaming.\u201d A gender action plan (GAP) was prepared to enhance women\u2019s active and \nequitable participation in the project and help ensure that benefits accrue to women. Gender-\nspecific measures are included in the resettlement plans and a social action plan. The PMO will \nimplement the GAP measures, monitor impacts, and provide ADB with sex-disaggregated data \non employment and participation, as detailed in the GAP\u2019s monitoring section and other project \ndocuments. GAP implementation will (i) increase women\u2019s participation in the project through \ntargets  that  specify  women  will  account  for  (a)  at  least  30%  of  people  employed  during \nconstruction, (b) 50% of participants in public consultations, and  (c) at least 30% of participants \nin capacity development training; and (ii) ensure the collection of sex-disaggregated baseline \nand survey data, and establishment and monitoring of the GAP indicators. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination,  including \nenvironmental management plan was prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009),  and  disclosed  to  potentially  affected  people.  Anticipated  environmental \nimpacts during construction include significant earthworks, waste management, soil erosion, \nand health and safety risks around construction sites. These impacts are of a temporary nature \nand are covered by stringent construction site management and procedural provisions in the \nenvironmental management plan. During operation, predicted ambient air and noise quality \nalong project roads and at solid waste collection, composting and disposal facilities are within \npermitted limits. The water supply system in Baishan is not anticipated to affect local water \nresources  and  downstream  water  users. 25  JPG  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \n                                                \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Water source  protection  measures and  minimum  flow  requirements  are  specified in  the  Xibeicha  reservoir \noperation specifications. \n ", "9 \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  the  environmental  management  plan.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  assurances  and  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening  activities  under  the  project.  JPG  conducted  meaningful  consultations  with \npotentially affected people and project beneficiaries. Environmental complaints will be handled \nin accordance with the grievance redress mechanism developed for the project. \n \n26.  The project will have significant environmental benefits. In Baishan, the project will \nimplement a supervisory control and data acquisition system to improve energy efficiency.26 \nBaishan\u2019s resilience to climate variability will be strengthened by reducing NRW (from 65% to \n35%); by increasing the number of supply options and thus water source redundancy; through \ndemand management (i.e., public awareness on water conservation); and through water supply \nsafety planning. In Baicheng, the project will promote low-carbon transport modes, and curbside \nstormwater collection and infiltration will be piloted along selected roads to mitigate the risk of \nwater logging. In the two cities, about 14,000 tons/year of kitchen waste will be converted into \nvaluable compost. In Baishan, the proposed sanitary landfill will include methane capture. \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The implementing agencies, with the support of \na local institute, prepared resettlement plans for (i) Baicheng urban infrastructure and integrated \nMSW management, (ii) the Baishan water supply, and (iii) Baishan MSW management. The \nproject affects 10 villages and three towns. The total permanent land acquisition is 2,425 mu, \nincluding 796 mu of state-owned land and 1,629 mu of collective land.27 Total house and \nbuilding demolition area is 59,715 square meters. It is estimated that a total of 1,914 persons \nfrom  701  households  will  be  affected,  including  364  households  affected  only  by  land \nacquisition,  293  households  by  house  demolition,  and  44  households  by  both.  Three \nresettlement plans were prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nendorsed  by  the  Baicheng  and  Baishan  municipal  governments,  disclosed  to  the  affected \npersons, and uploaded on the ADB website on 25 May 2014. Compensation for lost assets and \nresettlement allowances will be paid to affected people. Livelihood rehabilitation arrangements \nin accordance with the resettlement plan will be made prior to the commencement of the related \ncivil  works.  The  executing  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  the  capacity  and  the \nresponsibility  for  planning,  implementing,  financing,  and  reporting  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. A grievance redress mechanism has been established. An external resettlement \nand  social  monitor  will  be  engaged  to  conduct  semiannual  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nresettlement implementation. The Baicheng and Baishan municipal governments have stated \nthat the funds for involuntary resettlement will be available on time. \n \n28.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C). No specific communities of ethnic minorities or \ngroups are living separately and no adverse impacts are expected. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  The project has no unusual technical risks. The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n \n \n                                                \n26 The supervisory control and data acquisition system and NRW-reduction measures will save 6.4 million cubic \nmeters of water and 0.65 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. \n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelay  in  project  implementation  resulting  Mitigation  includes  early  mobilization  of  loan  implementation \nfrom slow bidding process, disbursement,  consultants; technical support for procurement, contract management, \nand  limited  experience  of  the  two  disbursement,  and  financial  management;  and  training  on  ADB \nimplementing agencies with ADB projects.  guidelines and procedures.
