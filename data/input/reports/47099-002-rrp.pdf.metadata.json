The program includes policy actions to (i) reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness,  (ii)  strengthen  protection  for  businesses,  and  (iii)  increase  business  innovation  and \nproductivity.2 The  programmatic  approach  will  comprise  three  subprograms  to  be  implemented \nduring  2015\u20132019;  subprogram  2  is  scheduled  for  2017,  and  subprogram  3  for  2019.  The \nconcept  paper  for  the  programmatic  approach  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) Board of Directors on 28 October 2014.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA.\n\n \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nTajikistan\u2019s  transition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market  economy  following  the \ndissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 has been one of the slowest among the Commonwealth \nof  Independent  States  (CIS).  The  civil  war  in  1992\u20131997  eroded  the  country\u2019s  human  and \nphysical capital inherited from the Soviet Union. While growth has been robust since the end of \nthe civil war, this growth started from a low economic base and Tajikistan\u2019s output remains close \nto 1991 levels. The government has retained control over many production activities and directly \ninfluences  prices  in  several  markets.  Tajikistan\u2019s  economy  has  not  achieved  the  level  of \nstructural transformation that has taken place in other CIS countries. \n \nSince  2005,  Tajikistan\u2019s  growth  has  been  driven  by  consumption,  fueled  by  remittance \n4. \ninflows.  Limited  job  opportunities  in  Tajikistan  have  encouraged  up  to  40%  of  the  working \npopulation (largely males) to seek jobs abroad, mostly in the Russian Federation. This has been \nfacilitated by an agreement on labor migration signed by Tajikistan and the Russian Federation \nin 2004. In 2013, remittances accounted for 49% of gross domestic product (GDP), which was \nthe  highest  dependency  on remittances  of  any  economy  in the  world.4 Tajikistan\u2019s  economy  is \nhighly reliant on external factors, such as the economic situation in the Russian Federation and \nthe international prices of two key export commodities: aluminum and cotton. \n \n5. \nGovernance and capacity of institutions in Tajikistan have improved marginally over the \nlast  decade  (ranked  4.1  in  2015  on  a  1\u20137  scale,  up  from  3.4  in  2006)  but  remain  weak  by \ninternational standards.5 The majority of policy decisions, including on some public investments, \nare  made  without  comprehensive  public  scrutiny  and  analysis  of  their  economic  and  social \nimpacts.6 Tajikistan\u2019s executive bodies often lack an in-depth understanding of policy concepts \nand implementation methods, limiting the effectiveness of policy decisions. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance:  ADB.  2013.

The  Policy  Process  in \nGovernment  in  Tajikistan:  Recent  Dynamics,  Challenges  and  Opportunities.  Institute  of  Public  Policy  and \n\n\fDespite  efforts  to  raise  Tajikistan\u2019s  Doing  Business  ranking  (footnote  28),  private \n6. \ninvestment  continues to be  constrained  by  an  unfavorable business  environment that  imposes \nhigh uncertainty. Arbitrary taxation and informal inspection arrangements reduce the prospects \nof  fair  competition.  The  same  government  agency\u2014Tajikstandard\u2014sets  technical  regulations, \ncertifies product quality, and accredits conformity assessment bodies; this is prone to conflicts of \ninterest.  Strong  perceptions  of  corruption  and  expropriation  risks  discourage  businesses  and \ninvestors  from  expanding  or  investing  in  Tajikistan.  The  judiciary\u2019s  ability  to  enforce  contracts \nand protect investor rights is uncertain.7 Executive documents\u2014government orders, instructions, \nministerial  memos,  and  regulations\u2014are  often  inaccessible,  leaving  businesses  and  investors \nunaware of existing rules. There is limited accountability regarding business ownership. \n \n7. \nBusinesses have limited knowledge of modern production techniques. Only 17% of firms \nreport having an internationally recognized quality certification (16.7% in 2008). Tajikistan ranks \n121st out of 140 countries in cluster development (footnote 5). Businesses have limited access \nto  external  markets  due  to  poor  transport  and  logistics  infrastructure,  and  restrictive  regional \ntransit  arrangements.  The  energy  supply  is  unreliable  and  large  parts  of  the  country  lack  a \nstable  electricity  supply  during  the  6-month  winter  period.8 Financing  is  expensive  and  short \nterm,  reducing  investors\u2019  capacity  to  expand  and  compete  internationally.  Credit  to  the  private \nsector  was  21.5%  of  GDP  in  2014\u2014in  line  with  the  average  for  fragile  and  conflict-affected \ncountries (20.0% of GDP)\u2014, which is nevertheless an improvement from 16.9% of GDP during \n2009\u20132013.9 Overall, Tajikistan\u2019s country risk is very high.10 \n \n8. \nThe  private  sector  remains  weak  and  has  made  limited  progress  in  expanding  its \nproductive  capabilities  to  create  more  wealth.  Since  2005,  the  private  sector\u2019s  contribution  to \nGDP  has  remained stable at  about  55%;  this  is lower  than Kazakhstan (65%)  and the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  (75%),  but  higher  than  Turkmenistan  (25%)  and  Uzbekistan  (45%). 11 Many  of  the \nshortcomings  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  economy\u2014low  competitiveness  of  products  in  particular\u2014reflect \nthe private sector\u2019s poor performance. Until 2014, remittance inflows supported the appreciation \nof  the  real  effective  exchange  rate,  thereby  reducing  export  competitiveness.  The  number  of \nproducts exported with comparative advantage declined from 48 in 1995 to 44 in 2012.12 \n \n9. \nInvestment (gross fixed capital formation) is relatively low, averaging 16% of GDP during \n2005\u20132013. This limits future economic growth and job creation. Investment is largely funded by \nthe  government  and  development  partners;  private  investment  was  5%  of  GDP  during  2005\u2013\n2013, one of the lowest levels in the world. Foreign direct investment dropped from 9% of GDP \nduring 2004\u20132008 to 1% of GDP during 2009\u20132014, and is mainly concentrated in a few sectors: \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n\nAdministration Working Paper.

Public \n\nfinancial \ninvestment is focused on large infrastructure and energy projects with long gestation periods. \n \n10. \nThe  programmatic  approach  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  national  development \nstrategy  for  2007\u20132015.13 The government  is  developing  a new  national  development  strategy \nfor 2016\u20132030, which is expected to focus on development of the real economy, diversification \nof  production,  productive  employment,  expansion  of  the  export  potential  of  locally  produced \ngoods and services, improvement of the investment climate, and support for entrepreneurship. \nIn March 2013, Tajikistan acceded to the World Trade Organization, a process that has led the \ngovernment to introduce improvements to its trade regime. \n \n11. \nUnder  the  program,  ADB  provides  the  government  with  advice  on  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  new  policy  and  institutional  mechanisms  to  improve  the  investment  climate \n(footnote  2).14 ADB  budget  support  provides  the  government  with  incentives  for  reforms  that \notherwise would be delayed or not implemented. ADB support is important because the political \nsystem is often divided and vested interests resist policy changes. The programmatic approach \nis the best modality to implement required reforms in a chronologically sequenced manner. \n \n12. \nThe  programmatic  approach  is  aligned  with  (i)  the  interim  country  partnership  strategy \nfor  2015,  which  includes  support  for  private  sector  reforms  as  one  of  three  operational \npriorities;15 and (ii)  the  forthcoming  country  partnership  strategy  for  2016\u20132020,  through  which \nADB plans to increase support for government-led reforms to achieve macroeconomic stability, \nimprove  the  investment  climate,  diversify  the  economy,  and  increase  competitiveness.  The \nEconomic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation  Department  conducted  a  country  diagnostic \nstudy  that  explains  Tajikistan\u2019s  declining  competitiveness  (footnote  12),  which  was  a  factor  in \nthe  selection  of  improvement  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  competitiveness  as  a  strategic  thrust  of  ADB \nassistance  for  2016\u20132020.  The  Independent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  country  assistance \nprogram  evaluation  for  1998\u20132013  recommended  that  ADB  increase  its  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment to strengthen governance and improve the business and investment climate.16 \n \n13. \nIn  2014,  ADB  completed  a  policy-based  program  in  Tajikistan  to  strengthen  tax \nadministration, social protection, and public financial management.17 In 2014, ADB approved its \nfirst  nonsovereign  operation  in  Tajikistan.18 Ongoing  technical  assistance  is  strengthening  the \nenvironment  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  the  anti-money  laundering  regime. 19  ADB \ncontinues to support restructuring of the energy sector.

The  outcome  will  be  increased  capabilities  and  opportunities  of \nbusinesses to set up and expand higher value-added production. \n \nC.\n\nOutputs \n\n \n\nThe  program  includes policy  actions that  will  help deliver  three  outputs  along the  three \n15. \nsubprograms:  (i)  reduced  cost  of  doing  business,  (ii)  strengthened  protection  for  businesses, \nand  (iii)  increased  business  innovation  and  productivity.  Subprogram  1  has  10  policy  actions; \nsubprogram 2 has 10 indicative policy actions, while subprogram 3 has 11. \n \n16. \nOutput 1: Reduced cost of doing business. The objective is to reduce the regulatory \ncost  of  operating  in  Tajikistan.  Under  subprogram  1,  to  reduce  unnecessary  costs  for \nbusinesses,  the  government  is  approving  a  new  regulatory  impact  analysis  (RIA)  system  for \nnewly  proposed  legal  acts,  and  started  two  pilot  RIAs  (on  improving  access  to  finance  and \nimproving  food  safety  through  technical  regulations).  Under  subprograms  2  and  3,  the \ngovernment  will  implement  the  new  RIA  system\u2014including  gender  analysis\u2014and  publish  RIA \nresults more widely on an authorized government website. \n \n17. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  parliament  is  expected  to  approve  a  new  law  on  business \ninspections  that  uses  a  risk-based  inspection  system  and  a  new  mechanism  for  coordination \nand reporting of annual inspection plans for all government agencies that conduct inspections. \nTo  fulfill  the  country\u2019s  commitments  under  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the  government \ndisclosed and reviewed the list of all existing provisional technical regulations, and removed 107 \noutdated technical regulations. This effort will continue during subprograms 2 and 3, along with \nthe introduction of voluntary international standards. \n \n18. \nAs  of  1  July  2015,  180,000  taxpayers  under  the  simplified  regime  (out  of  a  total  of \n240,000  taxpayers)  can  apply  to  the  Tax  Committee  for  a  log-in  and  mobile  password \nauthentication  system.  The  new,  free  system  allows  taxpayers  to  submit  tax  declarations \nthrough  the  Tax  Committee\u2019s  website.  The  committee  conducted  a  nationwide  awareness \ncampaign (using workshops; television and radio; and its call center) to inform taxpayers about \nthis  option.  Under  subprograms  2  and  3,  the  committee  will  expand  the  use  of  electronic \ndeclarations to facilitate timely and effective tax compliance, particularly through the log-in and \nmobile  password  authentication  system,  while  continuing  to  make  the  old  token-based \nauthentication system available to other taxpayers (e.g., payers of value-added tax). \n \n19. \nOutput  2:  Strengthened  protection  for  businesses.  The  objective  is  to  increase \ntransparency  and  thereby  reduce  expropriation  risks  for  businesses.  The  government  is \nimproving transparency of business ownership: as of 8 July 2015, the Tax Committee\u2019s website \n(www.andoz.tj)  provides  access  to  information  in  the  committee's  database  of  legal  entities \n(including  ownership,  management,  economic  activity,  capital,  and  contacts).  Subprograms  2 \nand  3  will  further  support  transparency,  particularly  regarding  legal  documents  and  gender-\ndisaggregated  statistics  of  business  ownership,  to  ensure  that  the  government  is  better \nprepared to support women entrepreneurship. \n \nThe  new  investment  law\u2014to  be  submitted  for  Parliament  approval  under  subprogram \n20. \n1\u2014seeks to ensure a more transparent and consistent treatment  of investment incentives and \nto signal the government\u2019s interest in promoting private investment. An authorized government \n\n \n\n\fbody  will  coordinate  and  make  public  all  investment  incentives.  The  draft  law  establishes  the \nconcept of indirect expropriation and the right of the investor to compensation in such cases.21 \nUnder  the  program,  the  government  will  (i)  improve  investment  promotion  by  structuring  the \ninvestment  promotion  agency  according  to  international  good  practice,  with  a  clear,  long-term \nresults  framework;  strengthened  governance;  internal  control;  and  funding;  and  (ii)  approve \nlegislation with clear methods for determining compensation in case of expropriation. \n \n21. \nOutput  3:  Increased  business  innovation  and  productivity.  The  objective  is  to \nimprove  the  productivity  of  firms  operating  in  Tajikistan.  In  subprogram  1,  the  government  is \ntransferring Tajikstandard accreditation functions to the newly established National Accreditation \nCenter,  a  body  with strengthened governance,  including management that  is  accountable  to  a \nsupervisory  board  with  independent  members.  The  National  Accreditation  Center  will  become \nfully  independent  of  Tajikstandard  by  1  January  2017.  This  will  reduce  potential  conflicts  of \ninterest within the quality infrastructure system, and support product quality certification. \n \n22. \nThe government has raised the status for the Entrepreneurship Support Fund (ESF) and \nchanged its governance structure  to one governed by a supervisory council.  This will increase \nESF  oversight  and  enable  increased  funding  from  the  state  budget.  Under  the  program,  the \ngovernment will adopt a credit guarantee scheme that will work with private financial institutions \nto  finance  investments  by  local  businesses  in  innovation,  particularly  for  businesses  led  by \nwomen.  Under  subprograms  2  and  3,  the  government  will  improve  ESF  governance,  internal \ncontrol, and funding to support local businesses when investing in innovation. \n \n23. \nIn  subprogram  1,  the  government  (i)  increased  state  budget  allocation  for  grants  to \nbusinesswomen for cofinancing of investments, and (ii) allocated office space for two business \nservice  centers,  which  are  managed  by  nongovernment  organizations  and  provide  incubation \nand other services such as marketing and taxation advice. The program will continue to finance \ninvestments by businesswomen, and to support business service center expansion. \n \n24. \nIn subprogram 1, the President of Tajikistan instructed the government to (i) develop and \nadopt a new tariff policy for electricity that will eliminate cross-customer price subsidies; and (ii) \ncarry  out  public  consultations  in  developing  and  implementing  the  policy.  The  new  tariff  policy \nwill  become  effective  on  or  before  1  January  2017,  and  allow  fair  competition  among \nbusinesses. The government will include subsidy allocations in the state budget to ensure tariff \nincreases  do  not  negatively  affect  low-income customers.  Under  the  program,  the government \nwill introduce measures to improve collection rates in the energy sector. \n \nD.\n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n \n\n25. \nTajikistan  remains  the  poorest  country  in  the  CIS,  with  the  lowest  per  capita  (i)  GDP \n($1,099  in  2014),  and  (ii)  social  expenditures.  Development  financing  needs  are  substantial, \nparticularly for social security and welfare expenditures (predominantly pensions). The pension \nsystem  faces  demographic  challenges,22 which  explain  in  part  the  significant  increase  in  the \nstate budget share allocated to social expenditures (from 32.8% in 2010 to 44.4% in 2014). \n26. \n\nThe  government  is  cutting  expenditures  due  to  lower-than-expected  revenues\u2014a \n\n                                                \n21 Indirect expropriation occurs when the state interferes with the use of the investor\u2019s property or its benefits, even if \nthe  property  is  not  seized  and  the  title  not  affected  (e.g.,  if  government  measures  force  an  investor  to  flee  the \ncountry,  deny  an  investor  access  to  funds  or  profits,  or  compel  the  investor  to  sell  or  transfer  at  an  unfairly  low \nprice). \n\n22 The  number  of  public  pensioners  increased  by  just  1.0%  during  1997\u20132009,  but  rose  more  than  2.5%  per  year \n\nduring 2010\u20132014 (from 554,000 to 611,000), an effect of the post-World War II \u201cbaby boom.\u201d \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nconsequence of  the  economic  slowdown.  Growth is  projected  to  decline from  6.7%  of GDP  in \n2014 to 3.5% in 2015. Remittance inflows in dollar terms dropped 32% in the first half of 2015 \ncompared  with  the  first  half  of  2014,  slashing  consumption.  Revenue  collection  in  the  first  9 \nmonths of 2015 was TJS392 million below the target. The estimated financing gap in the state \nbudget is about $170 million for 2015 and about $42 million for 2016 (Table 1). Fiscal support is \nneeded  to  prevent  reduction  of  critical  social  expenditures;  address  demographic  challenges \n(i.e., increased pension demand and the return of migrants); and finance subprogram 1.23 \n \n\nTable 1: Tajikistan State Budget\u2019s Financing Gap \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\nAmount \n($ million)  % of GDP \n\nAmount \n($ million)  % of GDP \n\nItem \n1.

The loan will have a \n24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft financing agreement. The government is closing the remaining financing gap by using \ncash  reserves,  reducing  noncritical  expenditures,  and  delaying  capital  expenditure  plans  and \nincreases  in  salaries  and  pensions.  The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The  indicative  size  of \nsubprograms  2 and  3  is  $20 million  and $30 million;  this  will  be  finalized  during processing of \neach subprogram, taking into account the government\u2019s development financing needs. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan for Subprogram 1 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nSpecial Funds resources (grant) \nSpecial Funds resources (loan) \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nAmount ($ million) \n \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n \n\n53.4 \n6.6 \n60.0 \n\n89.0 \n11.0 \n100.0 \n\n                                                \n23 The 2015 budget allocates 45.1% of available resources (or 13.2% of GDP) to social expenditures. \n24 A country's eligibility for  Asian Development Fund  grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis  conducted by the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank in November 2014 determined that Tajikistan had a moderate risk of debt distress and was therefore \neligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. The rating was based on debt-to-GDP, \ndebt-to-exports (including remittances), and debt-to-budget revenue ratios. \n\n\fTajikistan\u2019s long-term debt sustainability remains moderate despite short-term balance of \n28. \npayments and fiscal shocks (footnote 24). External debt declined from an average of about 70% \nof  GDP  in  2000\u20132011  to  28%  in  2014,  due  to  economic  growth,  debt  forgiveness,  and  grant \nassistance  from  development  partners,  such  as ADB,  the World  Bank,  and  bilateral  agencies. \nPublic and publicly guaranteed debt was 28.2% of GDP at the end of 2014; the Export\u2013Import \nBank of China was the largest creditor (52%), with the remainder owed to multilateral donors.25 \n \n29. \nThe macroeconomic deterioration and depletion of foreign exchange reserves observed \nsince  the  end  of  2014  can  worsen  debt  ratios.  Tajikistan\u2019s  gross  official  reserves  were \nequivalent  to  1.4  months  of  imports  as  of  the  end  of  2014  and  are  projected  to  be  just  1.2 \nmonths equivalent of imports by the end of 2015. Similar to many currencies in the region, the \nTajik somoni depreciated 30% against the US dollar in the year ending 30 September 2015.26 In \n2014  the  current  account  deficit  was  9.1%.  Tajikistan  is  graduating  from  all-grant  assistance \nfrom  major  development  partners  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  The  government  lacks \naccess  to  international  financial  markets  to  finance  sovereign  debt,  because  of  the  very  high \ncountry risk (footnote 10). Domestic financing is very limited and short term. \n \nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n30. \nThe  executing  agency  is  the  State  Committee  on  Investments  and  State  Property \nManagement  (SCISPM).  The  implementing  agencies  are  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water \nResources,  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  SCISPM,  the  ESF,  Tajikstandard,  and  the  Tax \nCommittee. The Executive Office of the President, the Ministry of Finance, and the Secretariat \nof  the  Consultative  Council  on  Improvement  of  Investment  Climate  under  the  President  will \noversee program implementation. No program implementation unit will be established. \n \n31. \nFinancing  proceeds  for  subprogram  1  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  to  the \nGovernment  of  Tajikistan  as  the  recipient  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  upon  compliance  with  all  policy  actions  for \nsubprogram 1 and with satisfaction of all conditions precedent to loan and grant effectiveness. \nThe proceeds will be used to finance the cost of items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is January\u2013December 2015. The closing \ndate is 30 June 2016. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA.\n\n \n\nEconomic and Fiscal Impacts \n\n32. \nThe  program  supports  economic  growth  through  reforms  that  increase  investment \nopportunities  and  improve  capabilities  of  firms  to  set  up  and  expand  higher  value-added \nproduction.  The  reforms  are  expected  to  help  firms  in  Tajikistan  raise  revenues  from  product \nsales  and  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business,  thus  increasing  their  expected  returns.  The \nprimary  beneficiaries  are  current  and future  entrepreneurs  and  investors  who  will  benefit  from \nan improved business environment; women entrepreneurs are specifically targeted. The reforms \nare expected to provide indirect benefits to the working population (employed and unemployed), \nbecause  investment  opportunities  will  create  jobs  and  increase  wages.  Reduced  regulatory \ncosts will attract more businesses to the formal sector, increasing the number of formal jobs. \n\n                                                \n25  ADB recognizes China as the People's Republic of China. \n26 Source: National Bank of Tajikistan. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nInspections and certification impose direct costs on the average small and medium-sized \n33. \nenterprise equivalent to 16.6% of profits.27 More than 1,000 legal acts are adopted every year in \nTajikistan  and  these  can  impose  unnecessary  costs  on  businesses,  because  the  government \nperforms  limited  quality  checks  on  the  drafts.  RIA  will  improve  decision-making  quality  and \nreduce  unnecessary  costs  to  businesses  arising  from  new  policy  and  regulatory  proposals. \nMore than 100 outdated technical regulations were eliminated in 2015, reducing the regulatory \nburden on firms. Electronic tax declarations will improve transparency and reduce opportunities \nfor  corruption;  the  new  system  will  help  increase  the  number  of  taxpayers  filing  electronically \nfrom about 6,500 taxpayers at the end of 2014 to more than 40,000 by the end of the program. \n \n34. \nThe perceived risk of corruption and expropriation is high, discouraging businesses and \ninvestors from  expanding  or  investing  in Tajikistan.  Disclosure of  the  ownership of  businesses \non  the  Tax  Committee\u2019s  website  will  increase  transparency  and  reduce  expropriation  risks  for \nbusinesses.  Increased  stability  in  legislation\u2014particularly  regarding  taxation\u2014provided  by  the \nnew law on  investments will improve the attractiveness of investing in Tajikistan. Recent large \nprivate investments in Tajikistan in the beverages and distribution sectors are encouraging. \n \n35. \nThe restructuring of Tajikstandard is expected to improve the institutional and regulatory \nframework for firms in Tajikistan applying for certification of product quality. Improvements in the \nquality  of  products  made  in  Tajikistan  are  critical  to  reversing  the  decline  in  the  number  of \nproducts exported with comparative advantage (para. 8). Government support through the ESF \nand  grants  to  women  entrepreneurs  are  expected  to  improve  low  levels  of  financing  for \ninvestments in product and service innovation (para. 7). \n \nAccess  to  electricity  is  a  binding  constraint  to  business  development.  Tajikistan  ranks \n36. \n177th out of 189 economies on the ease of getting electricity.28 Firms are reluctant to invest in \nnew  equipment  and  automated  production  if  they  cannot  access  a stable  supply  of  affordable \nelectricity.  Existing  indirect  (tariff-based)  cross-customer  energy  subsidies  distort  both  the \npricing structure and market competition. The new tariff policy for electricity is expected to bring \n(i) additional revenues to a system that charges consumers at a rate lower than required to fully \nrecover  costs,  and  thus  is  not  yet  self-sufficient;  and  (ii)  fairer  competition  for  private \nbusinesses, which pay tariffs that are almost triple those paid by organizations\u2014e.g., budgetary \norganizations and state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\u2014that successfully lobby for lower tariffs. The \nreforms will improve access to a reliable supply of electricity. \n \n37. \nThe government is expected to incur significant adjustment costs and revenue losses in \nthe  implementation  of  policy  reforms  under  the  program.  The  majority  of  the  costs  will  come \nfrom  the  increase  of  state  budget  allocations  to  (i)  budgetary  organizations,  to  pay  for  higher \nelectricity  tariffs  arising  from  removal  of  the  implicit  subsidy  in  their  tariff;  (ii)  the  low-income \npopulation  as  compensation  for  higher  electricity  costs  (through  the  Utility  Subsidy  and  the \nTargeted Social Assistance Program) arising from the new policy that will remove implicit cross-\ncustomer subsidies from the tariff; and (iii) the ESF, for financing of businesses. Revenue losses \nwill  arise  from  strengthening  the  investment  incentives  regime,  i.e.,  from  the  increase  of  the \nstabilization period for investors that signed investment agreements with the government.29 \n \n\n                                                \n27 International  Finance  Corporation.  2009.

Development partners continue to assist the government in \naddressing these weaknesses. Recent PFM reform initiatives include (i) the creation of internal \naudit  institutions  in  selected  government  agencies,  (ii)  the  implementation  of  the  budget \nadministrative  classification,  (iii)  the  redesign  of  the  chart  of  accounts,  (iv)  improved \nmacroeconomic forecasting, and (v) basic monitoring of SOEs. \n \n39. \nThe government is revising the law on public procurement to address serious flaws (e.g., \nambiguous  provisions  on  single-source  procurement  and  complaints  handling)  that  can  cause \nmisprocurement  and  delay  public  investments.  The  Public  Procurement  Agency  is  heavily \ninvolved  in  managing  procurement,  which  conflicts  with  its  oversight  and  regulatory  functions. \nADB  is  reviewing  a  draft  procurement  law  and  will  support  capacity  building  for  its  effective \nimplementation.  ADB  will  facilitate  restructuring  of  the  Public  Procurement  Agency  into  an \neffective regulatory agency and promote procurement decentralization. \n \n40. \nTajikistan  scored  23  out  of  a  possible  100  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  Corruption \nPerception  Index,  where  0  is  \u201chighly  corrupt\u201d  and  100  \u201cvery  clean.\u201d30 The  program  includes \nmeasures  that  promote  transparency  and  reduce  opportunities  for  corruption:  (i)  a  new  RIA \nsystem that includes mechanisms for disclosure of newly proposed legislation; and a free, single \nrepository for executive documents; (ii) a coordination mechanism for government inspection of \nbusinesses;  and  (iii)  improved  information  about  ownership  of  businesses  through  the  Tax \nCommittee\u2019s website. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and with SCISPM. \n \nC.\n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\nPolicy reforms are expected to have indirect medium- and long-term impacts on poverty, \n41. \nmainly  through  more  sustainable  economic  growth  and  increased  employment  opportunities. \nPrivate  investment  is  expected  to  increase  as  a  result  of  the  reduced  cost  of  doing  business; \nmore transparent tax regime; improved access to electricity for businesses and households, and \nincreased  tariff  equity  for  businesses;  and  improved  protection  framework  for  investors. \nReduced regulatory costs are expected to attract businesses to the formal sector and increase \nformal jobs; improved business innovation and productivity should increase profits and wages. \n \nThe  program  includes  actions  to  address  obstacles  faced  in  particular  by  women \n42. \nentrepreneurs, and promote equality between male and female entrepreneurs. For subprogram \n1,  the  government  (i)  included  a  requirement  for  gender  analysis  in  the  RIA  system  for  newly \nproposed  legal  acts  to  understand  the  potential  impacts  on  women,  (ii)  allocated  funds  to \nbusinesswomen  to  cofinance  investments,  and  (iii)  supported  the  creation  of  two  business \nservice centers that have gender balance among their staff. The program will monitor the share \nof women among entrepreneurs, the number of women entrepreneurs that receive government \ncofinancing for investments, and the number of female taxpayers filing electronic declarations. \n\n                                                \n30 Transparency  International.

It is categorized as C for each of these \nsafeguard  areas.  ADB  consulted  with  private  businesses  and  business  associations  regarding \nthe program design and implementation. \n \nE.\n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\n44.      Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan.31 Private  investment  growth  may  be  constrained  by  lower  remittance \ninflows  due  to  the  deterioration  of  the  economic  situation  of  major  economic  partners. \nPerceptions  of  high  corruption  and expropriation  risks  may  discourage  business  investment  in \nTajikistan.  The  PFM  and  procurement  systems  are  weak,  although  PFM  reforms  to  address \nfiduciary  risks  are  being  introduced  (para.  38).  The  program  has  measures  promoting \ntransparency  and  reducing  opportunities  for  corruption  (para.  34).  The  recent  International \nMonetary  Fund  Article  IV  report  recommends  the  government  to  ensure  that  central  bank \nliquidity support benefits only banks with strong balance sheets and good collateral, and refrain \nfrom  shifting further  deposits  to  banks.  The  program\u2019s  overall  risk  assessment  is  high,  but  the \ngovernment  has  in  place  necessary  mitigating  measures.  Subprogram  1\u2019s  integrated  benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  the  SCISPM  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \n45. \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the financing agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n46. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  and \ngrant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nrecommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Investment Climate Reforms Program; \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR4,720,000  to  the  Republic  of \nTajikistan  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Investment  Climate  Reforms  Program,  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of  1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $53,400,000  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Investment  Climate  Reforms \nProgram, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board. \n\n13 November 2015 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \n\nDevelopment of the private sector and attraction of investments (National Development Strategy 2007\u2013\n2015)a \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nCapabilities and \nopportunities of \nbusinesses to set up \nand expand higher \nvalue-added \nproduction increased \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \na.

The \nNational Legislation Center will act as the \nregulatory oversight body and be \nresponsible for ensuring that the RIA \nsystem performs well. The revised RIA \nsystem will become fully effective by 1 \nJanuary 2017. During the transition period, \nADB will provide capacity building to key \ngovernment agencies, including guidance \nin the implementation of the two pilot RIAs \napproved by the government: (i) on food \nsecurity, and (ii) on access to finance by \nbusinesses. \n \nThe government is expected to approve the \nnew RIA system through a resolution by \nNovember 2015. \n \nAn estimated 1,030 and 1,150 legal acts \n(laws, parliament resolutions, presidential \ndecrees, and government resolutions) were \nadopted in Tajikistan during 2013 and \n2014.

This is expected to improve \ntargeting of inspections and reduce the \nburden for businesses that have low risks \nof noncompliance. This action has been \ncoordinated with the World Bank Group. \n \nCompleted. \n \nAs part of the WTO accession, technical \nworking groups coordinated by \nTajikstandard have been reviewing the list \nof technical regulations to remove those \nthat are redundant and outdated. Before \naccession to WTO there were more than \n10,000 mandatory technical regulations. In \n2014, this number had been reduced to \n1,120 provisional technical regulations.  \n \nUnder the ADB Program, Tajikstandard \ncoordinated a working group that identified \n107 outdated technical regulations that \nwere subsequently canceled through \namendments to Government Resolution \nno. 704, of 30 December 2009.
