A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  was \nAssessment  undertaken (Appendix 15). \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  comprises  two  components:  (i) reconstruction  and \nupgrading of damaged roads and bridges in Sichuan and Shaanxi \nprovinces, and (ii) reconstruction and improvements of damaged \nschools  in  Shaanxi  Province.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and \nreconstruct 368 high-priority earthquake damaged roads in the \nnineteen  worst-affected  counties  of  Sichuan  Province  and  10 \nsubprojects  in  the  four  worst-affected  counties  of  Shaanxi \nProvince. The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 12 high-\npriority  earthquake-damaged  education  facilities  in  the  three \nworst-affected counties in Shaanxi Province. These components \nare designed to be mutually supporting in achieving the overall \nobjective  of  restoring  the  affected  communities\u2019  access  to \ninfrastructure  to  pre-earthquake  levels,  and  ensuring  restored \ninfrastructure is in strict compliance with the latest seismic code. \n   \nRationale  Based on the Government\u2019s damage and needs assessment and \nthe request of the PRC Government, the Project identifies specific \nsectors  requiring  emergency  assistance  in  two  of  the  worst \nearthquake-affected  provinces  (Sichuan  and  Shaanxi).  The \nProject seeks to (i) build on the immediate relief provided by the \nGovernment in the earthquake-affected provinces; (ii) contribute \nto  coordinated  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  by  different \ndevelopment partners and the Government; and (iii) specifically \naddress  sustainable  recovery  priorities  by  providing  indirect \nlivelihood support through public infrastructure rehabilitation and \nreconstruction, which generates public employment and underpins \nthe  restoration  of  livelihood  activities  by  rehabilitating  roads, \nbridges,  and  schools.  The  project  design  draws  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  experience  in  delivering  emergency \nassistance  acquired  in  different  developing  member  countries \nover the past two decades, and complements relief and other \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  assistance  provided  by  the \nGovernment,  United  Nations  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations,  bilateral  development  partners,  and  the  World \nBank. \n ", "ii   \n  By meeting the earthquake reconstruction needs of the next 3 \nyears,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy (2004). The Project supports The \nState  Overall  Plan  for  Post-Wenchuan  Earthquake  Restoration \nand  Reconstruction  approved  by  the  Government  on  19 \nSeptember 2008.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is accelerated restoration of education \nand  transport  infrastructure  in  earthquake-affected  areas  of \nSichuan  and  Shaanxi  provinces.  The  Project  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to (i) restore the livelihoods and economic \nactivities  of  the  affected  population;  (ii)  accelerate  poverty \nalleviation  in  the  earthquake-affected  counties,  many  of  which \nhave  a  high  incidence  of  poverty;  and  (iii) rehabilitate  and \nreconstruct  public  and  community-based  infrastructure  that  is \nvulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is \nrestoration  of  people\u2019s  access  to  transport  and  education \ninfrastructure to pre-earthquake levels in 19 counties of Sichuan \nand four counties of Shaanxi provinces. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The total project cost is estimated at $441.6 million equivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a grace period of 8 years \nwith a maturity period of 32 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  As the Project is for emergency assistance, implementation will \nArrangements  start  immediately  after  approval  and  be  completed  within  36 \nmonths. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  in  Sichuan \nProvince;  and  Hanzhong  city  government  and  Baoji  city \ngovernment in Shaanxi Province \n   \nImplementing Agencies  Sichuan Highway Administration Bureau in Sichuan Province; and \ncounty-level  highway  administration  bureaus  for  roads  and \nbridges,  and  county-level  education  bureaus  for  schools  in \nShaanxi Province. ", "  iii\nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and the contemplated implementation \nschedule.  ADB\u2019s  procedure  for  providing  reconstruction \nassistance  after  disasters  allows  for  flexibility  so  that  project \nactivities  can  start  promptly.  National  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be the preferred procurement mode. \n   \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  1,698  person-months  of  national  construction \nsupervision consultant services will be used to monitor project \nimplementation  of  civil  works,  environmental  protection, \nresettlement, and project performance.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  bring  benefits  to  the  project  area  by \nBeneficiaries  (i) reconstructing and improving road conditions and accessibility \nin  townships  and  villages  in  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provinces, \n(ii) reconstructing and improving 12 schools in Shaanxi Province, \nand  (iii) creating  local  employment  opportunities  from  project \nconstruction and related activities. The Project will provide equal \nbenefits to females and males. \n \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  rural  roads  and  bridges  include \n(i) savings in vehicle operating costs as a result of improved traffic \nand  road  conditions,  (ii)  time  savings  for  rural  road  users, \n(iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents, \nand  (iv) economic  benefits  from  generated  traffic.  The \nreconstruction  and  upgrading  of  rural  roads  in  Sichuan  and \nShaanxi  provinces  will  benefit  about  5.6  million  people,  three-\nquarters of whom are rural and one-third of whom are poor. As \nreliable  transport  to  markets  becomes  more  readily  available, \ncash crop farming in remote or isolated areas will be stimulated \nand  access  to  off-farm  employment  opportunities  will  be \nbroadened. \n   \n  The Project will focus on reconstruction of and improvements to \n12 model schools to appropriate design standards, including six \njunior  secondary  and  six  primary  schools.  This  will  bring \nimmediate  benefits  to  the  schools\u2019  16,600  students  (including \nmore  than  8,000  female  students),  and  long-term  benefits  to \nfuture students drawn from the 460,000 residents of the areas \nserviced by the schools, about 40% of whom are from rural areas \nof remote counties. \n   \n  The Project will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to rebuild \nthe  economy,  rehabilitate  public  infrastructure  and  utilities, \nreinstate  seismic  code  compliance,  and  generate  employment. \nThe  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  schools  will \nenable education services to be restored, and will offer long-term \nbenefits  for  affected  persons  by  supporting  opportunities  for \nemployment and participation in economic activities. \n \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  Implementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of \nquality subprojects in the two sectors will be mitigated in several \nways.  Specific  monitoring  mechanisms  to  supervise \nimplementation  will  include  regular  design  and  construction \nsupervision  as  well  as  financial  audits.  To  undertake  such \nsupervision,  the  executing  agencies  will  be  supported  by \ndedicated  project  monitoring  offices  and  consulting  inputs. \nAnother  potential  risk  could  be  the  lack  of  experience  of  the \nimplementing  agencies  with  ADB  procedures.  This  will  be \nmitigated through tailored training for the implementing agencies \non  ADB  procedures  immediately  after  the  Project  becomes \neffective. ADB will provide continuous support and supervision of \nproject implementation to the implementing agencies, including \nconducting special review missions, if required. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  Government  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant \nsupport  for  capacity  building  for  Wenchuan  earthquake \nreconstruction. The TA grant support will have three components. \nTA grant support for project implementation will provide capacity-\nbuilding assistance to the executing and implementing agencies to \nenable  speedy  and  smooth  implementation,  particularly  with \nrespect  to  procurement,  disbursement,  monitoring,  and  quality \ncontrol.  TA  for  the  education  component  will  involve \n(i) establishment of two model schools, focusing on information \nand  communication  technology  and  on  natural  sciences; \n(ii) development of training materials, and provision of in-service \ntraining of teachers, including in areas such as student-centered \nlearning; and (iii) capacity building of the teachers in the worst-\naffected  counties.  In  the  transport  sector,  the  TA  will  provide \ncapacity building regarding (i) road construction quality in remote \nand mountainous areas, and (ii) sustainable rural road operation \nand maintenance systems. \n ", "106 o 00'E\nEMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR\nWENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nSHANXI\n1 2 3\nHENAN\nChencang Xi'an\nGANSU\nSHAANXI\nQINGHAI\n6\n8 5 12\nLueyang 7 4 1110\n9 Mianxian\nNingqiang\nChaotian\n300 km.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Wenchuan \nEarthquake  Reconstruction  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Providing  Capacity  Building  Support  for  Wenchuan  Earthquake \nReconstruction and, if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework for \nthe Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Natural Disasters in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n \n2.  The PRC has both a very large population (1.3 billion in 2005) and a vast land area. The \ncountry\u2019s complex climatic and varied geological conditions make it prone to many types of \nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and snowstorms. Mountainous areas \naccount for about 70% of the land area, and the nature of the PRC\u2019s mountains, rivers, and \nvalleys  give  rise  to  many  geological  and  hydro-meteorological  hazards,  including  frequent \nlandslides,  mudslides,  and  other  geological  hazards.  The  PRC  is  often  affected  by  storm \nsurges, cross-border biological hazards, forest and grassland fire hazards, and other significant \nhazards such as drought. PRC has a history of serious natural disasters of various types; \ndisasters  occur  with  high  frequency  over  a  wide  geographical  area,  and  often  result  in \nsignificant, widespread damage in densely populated areas. \n \n3.  The PRC has suffered more than 50 earthquakes of magnitude 71 or greater over the \nlast 50 years. Four of these exceeded magnitude 8. More specifically, Sichuan Province itself is \nparticularly  prone  to  hazardous  earthquakes.  Records  showed  that  six  major  earthquakes \nmeasuring magnitude 6.7\u20137.9 occurred in Sichuan Province between 1933 and 1989. \n \nB.  Earthquake in Wenchuan (Sichuan Province) \n \n4.  The massive earthquake\u2014measuring magnitude 8.0\u2014struck the southwest area of the \nPRC on 12 May 2008. The epicenter was in Wenchuan County, 92 kilometers (km) northwest of \nthe Sichuan provincial capital of Chengdu. The earthquake affected a vast area, including 10 \nprovinces (Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Chongqing, Yunnan, Hubei, Guizhou, Henan, Shanxi, \nHunan); 417 counties (cities and districts); 4,667 towns; and 48,810 villages. The total disaster \narea covered 500,000 square kilometers (km2), in which the 51 worst-affected counties (cities \nand districts) in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces covered 130,000 km2. The Wenchuan \nearthquake had a high intensity with a large number of aftershocks. According to China's \nSeismic Network, 33,000 aftershocks were monitored in the main earthquake area between 12 \nMay and 21 October 2008, including over 600 aftershocks measuring magnitude 4.0 and above, \n60 aftershocks measuring magnitude 5.0 and above, and seven measuring magnitude 6.0\u20136.9.  \n \n5.  The earthquake-affected areas in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces are mainly \nmountainous and hilly, and the altitude across most of the area is high. These conditions \n                                                 \n1  Earthquake magnitude is a quantitative measure of the wave amplitude an earthquake generates, and hence is a \nmeasure of its size. An increase of 1.0 in magnitude results in a 10-fold increase in the waveform amplitude and \nabout a 31-fold increase in the energy released. Earthquake intensity is a qualitative measure of the actual shaking \nat a location during an earthquake, and is typically based on three features: (i) perception by people and animals, \n(ii) performance of buildings, and (iii) changes to natural surroundings.  \n ", "2 \ncaused secondary disasters, such as landslides, collapse and mud-rock flows. For example, the \nearthquake resulted in many large-scale barrier lakes, which for a time threatened thousands of \npeople  living  at  lower elevations  in  Mianyang  county  in Sichuan  Province.  The  secondary \ngeological disaster caused by the earthquake had a widespread, profound and sustained impact \non  the  earthquake  disaster-affected  region.  The  disaster-affected  region  includes  both \neconomically less-developed and impoverished regions and also more advanced regions, such \nas the high-tech industrial zones of Chengdu, Deyang, and Mianyang.  \n \nC.  The Government\u2019s Response \n \n6.  The State Council set up an earthquake disaster relief headquarters as soon as the \nWenchuan earthquake was reported. The premier assumed the post of commander-in-chief and \npersonally directed the disaster response and relief through nine working teams. Under the \nguidance  of  the  State  Council,  different  government  agencies  worked  with  the  local \ngovernments to provide relief in disaster-affected areas. CNY27.5 billion was allocated for \ndisaster relief by the central Government, and this was supplemented by assistance provided by \nprovincial and local governments.  \n \n7.  Financial assistance included a solatium of CNY5,000, which was provided for each \ndeceased person; a subsidy of CNY28,000, provided for the seriously injured; and a special \nrelief subsidy of CNY600 per month, which is being provided for orphans, the elderly, and \nhandicapped people. The Government provided a subsidy of CNY10,000 to farmers whose \nhouses  were  severely  damaged,  which  was  supplemented  by  the  local  government.  The \nGovernment also established a system of counterpart restoration and reconstruction support, \nwith provinces helping heavily affected counties\u2014each province provided 1% of their revenue \nover the last financial year to support reconstruction and rehabilitation in a heavily affected \ncounty.  \n \n8.  For the first time, the Government requested support from the local and international \ncommunity, and donations totaled CNY59.5 billion. The international community responded \nquickly after the Wenchuan earthquake, and provided emergency assistance and support to the \nPRC for the initial rescue efforts. The assistance from the international community was mainly \nfocused  on  providing  funds  and  relief  supplies,  sending  rescue  and  medical  teams,  and \nproviding technical support.  \n \n9.  The three severely affected provinces (Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu) responded quickly \nto  the  disaster,  and  took  effective  measures  to  save  affected  persons  (APs).  The  three \nprovincial governments launched a multi-level (provincial, city, and county) contingency plan to \nfacilitate rapid and effective rescue and relief activities in the affected areas. Local governments \norganized search and rescue teams to rescue the people trapped in the collapsed structures \nand isolated, remote mountainous areas (in Sichuan alone 84,017 people were rescued from \ncollapsed structures and 1.49 million were rescued from isolated mountainous areas and then \nrelocated); medical teams and ambulances were organized to rescue the wounded; medicines, \nfood supplies, milk powder, drinking water, tents, clothing, quilts, and other urgently needed \nsupplies  were  delivered  to  the  affected  areas;  quick  action  was  taken  to  restore  critical \ninfrastructure such as water and power supplies, roads, bridges and telecommunications; urgent \nmeasures were taken to reduce risks from the dangerous reservoirs that had formed; and \nrelocated people were provided with tents, food, drinking water, clothes, and other basic needs, \nand arrangements were made to treat people with post-disaster psychological distress.  \n \n ", "3 \nD.  Damage and Needs Assessment \n \n10.  After the earthquake, the Government issued a regulation on 8 June 2008 on post-\nWenchuan earthquake disaster recovery and reconstruction and formed a working team headed \nby the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to conduct damage and needs \nassessments for infrastructure restoration and post-disaster reconstruction. Local and provincial \ngovernments collected damage data from counties, prefectures, and provinces, which was then \nconsolidated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA). NDRC worked with the line ministries to \nprepare an overall reconstruction plan, which was made available via the internet for comments \nfrom the general public and other stakeholders. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners were also invited to provide comments on the plan. The Government's \noverall reconstruction plan (Supplementary Appendix A) was approved by the State Council on \n19 September 2008.  \n \n11.  In addition, the Government requested that ADB provide TA to support the emergency \nresponse to the Wenchuan earthquake.2 The TA included a component to conduct a preliminary \nassessment of the damage and needs of the social and physical infrastructure, drawing from the \nGovernment\u2019s own assessment, and draw up a prioritized list of ADB programs and projects to \nassist reconstruction and recovery within the affected region. ADB consultants worked closely \nwith  the  MCA  and  conducted  an  assessment  of  the  impacts  on  social  and  infrastructure \nsectors\u2014including  urban  and  rural  housing,  public  facilities,  infrastructure,  agriculture  and \necology, industry, and public and commercial services\u2014using relevant assessment criteria and \nstandards. The summary of the damage and needs assessment is in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  In addition to the TA, ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission on 11\u201315 October 2008 \nand a fact-finding mission on 19\u201327 November 2008 to Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces to get \nfirst-hand knowledge for the preliminary damage and needs assessment, assess the scale of \ndamage caused by the earthquake, and meet with different stakeholders. \n \nE.  Impact of the Earthquake \n \n13.  The  Wenchuan  earthquake  caused  extensive  damage  and  heavy  losses,  mainly  in \nSichuan,  Shaanxi,  and  Gansu  provinces;  and  caused  some  damage  in  another  seven \nprovinces. The impacts of the earthquake were devastating\u2014as of 25 September 2008,  of the \n46.25 million affected people, 69,227 were dead, 374,643 were injured, 17,923 were missing, \nand 1.5 million people had been evacuated. About 8 million homes were destroyed and 24.5 \nmillion damaged, and 17,951 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged. Transport, \ninfrastructure,  power  supply,  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  critical  infrastructure  such  as \nhospitals  and  clinics  and  lifeline  facilities,  and  communications  were  destroyed  or  badly \ndamaged throughout the affected region. A large number of rural and urban houses collapsed, \ninfrastructure facilities were damaged on a large scale, agriculture and industry suffered heavy \nlosses, and there was severe environmental destruction. The earthquake caused high altitude \nlandslides, rock falls, and debris flows, and formed barrier lakes. The total direct economic loss \ncaused by the Wenchuan earthquake is estimated at CNY852,309 million; losses in Sichuan, \nShaanxi, and Gansu provinces are estimated at CNY845,136 million (99.16% of the total).  \n \n14.  The disaster\u2019s financial impact represents 3.3% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \nfor the 2007 fiscal year, and obviously impacts the country\u2019s economy. The earthquake was the \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

Manila (TA 7081-PRC). \n ", "4 \nsecond significant disaster to hit the PRC in 2008 (after the snow disaster in the southern \nprovinces). In addition, indirect losses from the Wenchuan earthquake could be much higher \nthan estimated above, due to the nature and scale of the damage and loss incurred. \n \n1.  Estimated Damages and Reconstruction Costs \n \n15.  Losses totalled CNY771.8 billion in Sichuan, CNY50.5 billion in Gansu, and CNY22.8 \nbillion in Shaanxi province, with Sichuan accounting for 91.32% of the total. Losses in the three \nprovinces\u2019  social  sectors  equalled  CNY465.3  billion  (55.05%  of  total  losses),  and  in \ninfrastructure CNY188.1 billion (22.26%).  \n \n16.  The total reconstruction cost for the 51 more severely affected counties (cities and \ndistricts) in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces is estimated at around CNY1 trillion.3 The \nCentral Post-quake Restoration and Reconstruction Fund established by the Government is \nexpected  to  cover  30%  of  the  total  reconstruction  cost.  Nineteen  provinces  have  set  up \npartnerships with 24 counties in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to provide in-kind assistance \nover a 3-year period to their counterparts, equal to not less than 1% of their budgetary financial \nrevenues during 2007.  \n \n2.  Impacts on Transport and Education Sectors \n \n17.  Transportation. Transportation infrastructure, which consists mainly of road and railway \nsystems, suffered losses of CNY87.39 billion, including CNY66.69 billion in road and CNY20.70 \nbillion in railway systems. An estimated 7,073 roads (40,012 km), 4,989 road bridges, and 158 \nroad tunnels were damaged. Most damage was in Sichuan Province. The Chengdu\u2013Mianyang \nhighway,  Mianyang\u2013Guangyuan  highway,  Ya\u2019an\u2013Shimian  highway  and  most  of  the \nnational/provincial roads within Aba Prefecture were completely blocked as a result of the \nearthquake. The damaged railway system included 4,026 km of railway lines, 377 railway \ntunnels, 1,280.9 km of power lines, 83 items of electrical equipment, and 52 locomotives. Some \nmajor railway stations such as Mianyang, Guangyuan, Jiangyou, and Deyang were seriously \ndamaged. \n \n18.  Transportation losses totaled CNY74.79 billion in Sichuan Province, CNY7.23 billion in \nGansu  Province,  and  CNY5.37  billion  in  Shaanxi  Province.  Road  systems  losses  equaled \nCNY58.33 billion in Sichuan, CNY7.07 billion in Gansu, and CNY1.29 billion in Shaanxi. Losses \nin the railway systems totaled CNY16.46 billion in Sichuan, CNY162 million in Gansu, and \nCNY4.08 billion in Shaanxi. The transport sector assessment and proposed assistance is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n19.  Education.  The  earthquake  had  a  devastating  impact  on  the  delivery  of  all  social \nservices in the affected areas. In addition to destruction or serious damage to physical facilities, \nmany  care  providers  (including  teachers  and  other  school  staff)  suffered  death  or  serious \ninjuries. Educational institutions at all levels\u2014from primary schools to degree colleges\u2014suffered \nsubstantial damage, with a total of 17,951 fully or partially damaged educational institutions, \nincluding 12,253 in Sichuan Province, 5,455 in Shaanxi Province, and 243 in Gansu Province. \nThe  counties  with  the  most  fully  destroyed  basic  schools  are  Mao  (153),  Pingwu  (137), \nWenchuan (129), and Beichuan (83). Losses of education sector are estimated at CNY4,676 \nmillion.  \n \n                                                 \n3  As estimated by the overall reconstruction plan, approved by the State Council on 19 September 2008.  \n ", "5 \n20.  Before the earthquake (at the end of 2007), Shaanxi Province had 18,953 primary and \nsecondary education facilities, which were adequate for its population of around 37 million, and \nprovided coverage to the province\u2019s urban and rural population. The earthquake affected 40 \ncounties in Shaanxi province, and four\u2014Chenchang, Lueyang, Mian Xian, and Ningqing\u2014were \nparticularly hard hit; about 25% of all schools in Shaanxi (5,455 schools) were damaged. A large \nnumber of schools are at risk of collapsing as a result of the significant damage they sustained. \nThe affected schools occupy 3.65 million square meters (m2) and the economic losses in \nShaanxi's education sector constitute CNY2.2 billion. The cost of reconstructing lost assets and \nrestoring education services is estimated to be CNY5.7 billion. The education reconstruction \nneeds are enormous and will take a substantial amount of time. The Government is already \nfinancing  the  reconstruction  of  117  schools  that  will  occupy  0.84  million  m2 and  will  cost \nCNY1.65 billion. The social sector assessment and proposed assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \nF.  Response of Development Partners \n \n21.  The international community responded quickly after the Wenchuan earthquake, and a \ntotal of 171 countries and over 20 international organizations provided emergency assistance \nand support, including funds and relief supplies, to the PRC. The United Nations and relevant \ninternational organizations were very concerned about the impact of the earthquake, and the \nUnited Nations set up a special fund to support the Government\u2019s relief efforts.  \n \n22.  On 1 November 2008, the State Council approved the use of emergency assistance \nloans from various international financial institutions for post-earthquake reconstruction, and \n$1.5 billion in loans have been requested by the Government from the various international \nfinancial institutions and bilateral donors. These will be allocated as grants to Sichuan, Shaanxi, \nand Gansu provinces for reconstruction, with the Government responsible for loan repayment.  \n \n23.  The $1.5 billion in loans includes requests for (i) a loan from the World Bank of $710 \nmillion, of which $510 million is allocated to Sichuan for reconstruction of urban and public \nhealth facilities, and $200 million to Gansu for reconstruction of education facilities; (ii) a loan \nfrom ADB of $400 million, of which $300 million is for Sichuan for rural road reconstruction and \n$100 million for Shaanxi for reconstruction of rural roads and bridges and primary and middle \nschools;  (iii)  a  loan  from  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  of  $200  million  for  urban \ninfrastructure  reconstruction  and  biogas  facility  restoration  in  Sichuan;  (iv)  a  loan  from \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) of $30 million and a grant of $1.5 million \nfor biogas facilities restoration in Sichuan; and (v) a loan from the European Investment Bank of \n$160 million for ecosystem restoration in Sichuan. \n \nG.  ADB\u2019s Strategy and Response \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  under  its  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy4 is  to  support \nnational and provincial governments and other stakeholders to overcome exogenous shocks \ncaused by calamities to enable early restoration of economic and social activity in affected \nareas, especially by the poor. The strategy is designed to ensure that emergency assistance \nprojects provide a bridging function to ameliorate the impacts of the disaster and dovetail into \nthe development process by selecting the highest priority needs for emergency assistance in \nconsultation with the central government, provincial and local governments, civil society, and \nother stakeholders, including other donors.  \n \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n ", "6 \n25.  After receiving the request for emergency assistance from the PRC Government, ADB \nimmediately  provided  TA  of  $1  million  to  PRC  for  providing  emergency  response  to  the \nWenchuan earthquake.5 The TA provided support for the Government\u2019s initial rehabilitation and \nrestoration  efforts  in  the  earthquake  disaster-affected  areas.  The  TA  also  provided  the \nopportunity to (i) assist the Government review the existing national disaster management \nsystem  framework,  with  specific  reference  to  the  Wenchuan  earthquake;  (ii)  conduct  a \npreliminary assessment of the damage and needs of the social and physical infrastructure, \nbased on the Government\u2019s own assessment; and (iii) prepare a prioritized list of ADB programs \nand  projects  that  will  assist  reconstruction  and  recovery  within  the  affected  region.  ADB \nprovided three policy notes6 to the Government on (i) recommendation for dealing with the \ntransition from disaster response to recovery, (ii) post disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction, \nand (iii) key issues for developing earthquake insurance in the PRC. These notes highlighted \nkey lessons from international experience and made recommendations for possible adoption by \nthe Government. ADB is also providing TA7 for promoting public and private participation in \ndisaster risk management. \n \nH.  Lessons \n \n26.  Lessons  in  Disaster  Response.  The  earthquake  impact  issues  that  constrain  the \nrecovery of affected provinces confirm the importance of lessons drawn from previous ADB \nemergency assistance and ADB policies. This is the first emergency assistance loan to be \nprocessed for the PRC under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.8 General \nlessons  can  be  drawn  from  past  experience  with  projects  developed  for  other  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) under this policy. The ongoing TA also identifies key lessons, which \nare also taken into consideration. \n \n27.  A review of ADB-wide experience with emergency rehabilitation assistanceindicates the \n \nfollowing essential factors: (i) projects must be prepared as quickly as possible; (ii) projects \nshould focus on restoring facilities; (iii) to the extent possible, rehabilitation works should be \ncompleted within 2\u20133 years; (iv) as implementation places a heavy burden on executing agency \nstaff, strong ADB supervision is needed during implementation; and (v) efforts should be made \nto ensure that ADB\u2019s rapid response to disasters is matched by equally quick government \naction. Lessons from ADB\u2019s earlier emergency projects include the following: (i) beneficiary \nparticipation  must  be  ensured  and  increased  in  project  preparation  and  implementation, \nespecially in the maintenance of facilities; (ii) environmental and social aspects should be \nconsidered during project implementation, even though the need for a rapid response may not \npermit  a  detailed  treatment  of  these  issues  prior  to  the  approval  of  the  assistance; \n                                                 \n5  The TA is ongoing (footnote 2). \n6  ADB. 2008.

The Wenchuan post-earthquake reconstruction is a major investment. The Government \nshould ensure reconstructed public and private buildings and infrastructure are protected from \nvarious types of hazards. A review of Wenchuan earthquake experience9 reveals that lessons \nfrom the damage should be fed into reconstruction planning, and future risks reduced through \nimproved building standards and design. The safety of public buildings such as schools is \nparticularly  important,  and  risks  should  be  reduced  through  strict  adherence  to  the  new \nconstruction standards. The primary lesson is that new buildings, including schools, need to be \ndesigned to withstand seismic shocks and built to a higher quality. Future compliance with the \nnew construction code will require strong enforcement. During the reconstruction phase, the \nrepair of damaged buildings needs to include seismic strengthening.  \n \n29.  The lessons and experiences of current relief and recovery coordination should be used \nto develop an appropriate disaster-management mechanism and authority, as well as a national \nplan  that  clarifies  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  different  government  agencies  and \nstrengthens coordination among them. Risk management education and training of staff from \nappropriate  agencies  would  greatly  improve  risk  management  in  the  country.  Primary  and \nsecondary  schools  should  raise  risk  awareness  through  the  curriculum.  Incorporating  risk-\nmitigation safety measures into the basic training of engineers, contractors, and builders should \nalso be considered as part of the reconstruction process. A major public awareness campaign \non risks, preparedness, and vulnerability reduction should be implemented as soon as possible.  \n \n30.  These lessons have been considered and incorporated in the design of the proposed \nProject. The Project being designed has three principles: simplicity, flexibility, and ease of \nimplementation.  With  an  implementation  period  of  36  months,  the  Project  focuses  on  the \nimmediate rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructure in the affected areas to facilitate the \nrestoration  of  livelihoods.  The  proposed  Project  has  been  prepared  based  on  detailed \ndiscussions with APs and other stakeholders, and visits to the affected project sites. The Project \nwill  complement  assistance  from  government  agencies  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies and donors. \n \nI.  Rationale \n \n31.  Based on the Government\u2019s damage and needs assessment and the request of the \nGovernment, the Project identifies specific sectors requiring emergency assistance in two of the \nworst earthquake-affected provinces in the PRC. The Project seeks to (i) build on the immediate \nrelief  provided  by  the  Government  in  the  earthquake-affected  provinces;  (ii)  contribute  to \ncoordinated  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  by  different  development  partners  and  the \nGovernment; and (iii) specifically address sustainable recovery priorities by providing indirect \nlivelihood  support  through  public  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  which \ngenerates  public  employment  and  underpins  the  restoration  of  livelihood  activities  by \nrehabilitating  roads,  bridges,  and  schools.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reversing  the \ndevastating impact of the Wenchuan earthquake and to reviving economic activity, and enable \npeople to resume and improve their livelihoods and return to normal life. This will be achieved \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Providing Emergency Response to Sichuan \nEarthquake. Manila (final report).  \n ", "8 \nprimarily by rehabilitating and reconstructing damaged and destroyed infrastructure as quickly \nas possible, which will particularly assist the poor and other vulnerable people.  \n \n32.  The  project  design  draws  on  ADB  experience  in  delivering  emergency  assistance \nacquired in different DMCs over the past two decades, and complements relief and other \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  assistance  provided  by  the  Government,  United  Nations \nagencies, nongovernment organizations, bilateral development partners, and the World Bank. \nBy meeting the earthquake reconstruction needs of the next 3 years, the Project is consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  The  Project  supports  the  overall \nreconstruction plan approved by the Government on 19 September 2008.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n33.  The impact of the Project is the accelerated restoration of the education and transport \ninfrastructure in the earthquake-affected areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. The Project \nwill support efforts of the Government of the PRC to (i) restore the livelihoods and economic \nactivities of the affected population; (ii) accelerate poverty alleviation in the earthquake-affected \ncounties, many of which have a high incidence of poverty; and (iii) rehabilitate and reconstruct \npublic and community-based infrastructure vulnerable to natural disasters. The outcome of the \nProject  is  restoration  of  people\u2019s  access  to  transport  and  education  infrastructure  to  pre-\nearthquake levels in 19 counties of Sichuan Province and four counties of Shaanxi Province.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n34.  The Project comprises two components: (i) reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged \nroads and bridges in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and (ii) reconstruction and rehabilitation of \ndamaged  schools  in  Shaanxi  Province.  These  components  are  designed  to  operate  in  a \nmutually supportive fashion to achieve the overall objective of mitigating earthquake losses to \nthe  affected  communities  and  providing  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  priority \neducation and transport infrastructure assets in strict compliance with latest seismic codes. \n \n35.  Transportation  Component. The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 368 high-\npriority earthquake-damaged roads (about 3,500 km in length) in nineteen of the worst-affected \ncounties of Sichuan Province10 and 10 subprojects (about 317 km in length) in four of the worst-\naffected counties of Shaanxi Province. Reconstruction will provide improved seismic designs, \nand will be undertaken with the adoption of appropriate and cost-effective earthquake-resistant \ndesign and construction standards. A general principle of \u201cbuild back better\u201d will be followed and \nroads will be constructed to a standard that is one level higher than existed previously. \n \n36.  Education Component. The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 12 high-priority \nearthquake-damaged education facilities in the three of the worst-affected counties in Shaanxi \nProvince.  Reconstruction  will  adopt  improved  earthquake-resistant  design.  Some  essential \nfurniture and equipment will also be procured for selected reconstructed and repaired schools. \nThe \u201cbuild back better\u201d principle will be followed and rebuilt schools will be of better quality and \ndesign, and include ancillary facilities\u2014e.g., dormitories, dining rooms, reading rooms, and toilet \nfacilities\u2014as part of the new construction. \n \n                                                 \n10 These are preliminary estimates and the number of subprojects may be adjusted based on cost considerations. \n ", "9 \nC.  Special Features \n \n37.  A  number  of  special  features  have  been  agreed  to  with  the  Government  and  are \nincluded in the project design. \n \n(i)  ADB grant assistance to provincial governments. For the first time, the ADB \nloan will be provided as a grant by the central Government to the provincial \ngovernments of Sichuan and Shaanxi. This represents a departure from past \npractice, thus enabling the provincial governments to utilize ADB assistance for \nnon-revenue generating projects such as rural roads and schools.  \n(ii)  People-centric approach. The earthquake affected a number of mostly poor \nand vulnerable people, and a people-centric approach to the Project has been \nadopted, with participatory project preparation. Extensive consultations were held \nwith local villagers, local governments, transport users, school children, teachers, \nand  other  stakeholders.  These  consultations  helped  in  (a)  understanding \nopinions  regarding  the  proposed  Project;  (b)  conducting  the  environmental, \neconomic, and social assessments; and (c) identifying the role of the various \nstakeholders. The Project has been prepared to enhance project benefits; ensure \nadverse impacts are avoided or mitigated; and ensure economic development \nbenefits the poor, women, and the vulnerable in an equitable and sustainable \nmanner. Leading groups for implementing the Project have been formed in the \ncounties, with participation by relevant government agencies, including poverty \nreduction offices; the All-China Women's Federation; and health, civil affairs, and \nethnic  affairs  bureaus.  Local  governments  have  provided  assurance  that \nconsultations to implement the Project will continue, particularly regarding social \nand environmental aspects.  \n(iii)  Build  back  better.  This  principle  will  be  applied  to  both  components.  The \nintervention  will  typically  replace  preexisting  assets,  and  hence  will  be \nreconstructed to the latest appropriate technical, earthquake-resistant standards. \nRural roads will be built to one standard higher (unclassified to class IV, class IV \nto class III, and class III to class II); and ADB-financed schools will benefit from \nconsolidation  and  will  be  developed  as  model  schools  with  three  general \nprinciples:  (a)  making  education  in  these  schools  more  modern  by  adopting \nmodern teaching aids, better equipped science laboratories, and establishing \nmultimedia labs; (b) making education for children more enjoyable by providing \nbetter infrastructure and services (dormitories, dining rooms, reading rooms, and \ntoilet facilities); and (c) providing capacity building support to the teachers. \n(iv)  Simple, flexible, and easy to implement. The Project has been processed \nunder ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. The procedures for \nproject  loan  processing,  procurement,  disbursement,  consultant  engagement, \nsubproject selection, and the type of works to be done reflect this flexibility, \nwithout compromising on quality, transparency, and safeguards. The Project is \ndesigned  to  ensure  proper  targeting,  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  and \ncommunity  participation  while  addressing  local  area  resource  and  capacity \nconstraints.  ADB  will  focus  on  ensuring  that  the  project  implementation  is \nefficient, effective, and expedient.  \n \n ", "10 \n(v)  Cooperation and collaboration. The Project has been prepared through close \nconsultation with other development partners such as World Bank11 and Agence \nFran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement. 12 The  project  design  and  implementation \narrangements are aligned to the maximum extent possible with the prevailing \nsystem in the PRC to minimize the administrative burden on the Government. \n(vi)  Building capacity at local level. Most ADB transport support has been at the \nprovincial level. The Project will be implemented at the county level and thus \nseeks  to  build  county  capacity.  Because  of  the  Project\u2019s  urgency,  ADB  will \norganize a startup training workshop for each province to help county officials \nunderstand ADB\u2019s project implementation requirements with respect to financial \nmanagement, procurement and disbursement. Follow-up assistance in the form \nof capacity-building support to implementing agencies (IAs) to facilitate smooth \nand  speedy  project  implementation  will  be  provided  by  consulting  services \nfinanced through the TA. Capacity-building support will also be provided to the \nteachers in the earthquake-affected counties. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n38.  The total project cost is estimated at $441.6 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties,  interest  during  implementation  and  other  charges.

Financing Plan \n \n39.  The Government has requested a loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a grace period of 8 years with a \n                                                 \n11 The World Bank is funding $710 million for reconstruction of the urban, health, and education sectors in Sichuan \nand Gansu provinces. \n12 Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement is funding $200 million for reconstruction of urban and biogas infrastructures \nin Sichuan Province. \n ", "11 \nmaturity period of 32 years,13 an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n40.  The ADB loan will cover the civil works cost of rehabilitating and reconstructing the \ntransport and education infrastructure, design, construction supervision, procurement, taxes and \nduties,14 and interest during implementation. The provincial and local governments will bear the \ncounterpart financing of project management, and the remaining costs of construction for the \npackages that do not have 100% ADB financing (Table 2). The Government will make the loan \nproceeds available to the Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments on a grant basis under \nthe implementation agreements on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSichuan  Shaanxi \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nProvince   Province \n         \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n41.  National Level. After the earthquake, the Government established a multi-disciplinary \ncore group within the State Council to plan and coordinate the post-earthquake rehabilitation \nand  reconstruction  program  in  the  affected  provinces.  This  core  group  functions  as  an \ninterdepartmental coordination mechanism for collecting data on damages, losses, rehabilitation \nand reconstruction needs, and outlays for earthquake-affected areas. An overall reconstruction \nplan for Wenchuan earthquake was developed and approved by the State Council as part of the \nrestoration of earthquake damaged infrastructure and services, and a leading group has been \nformed at the national level to monitor the plan\u2019s implementation.  \n                                                 \n13 This is in accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (para. 90, footnote 4). \n14 Taxes and duties are less than 5% of the total cost. \n ", "12 \n42.

Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces have established leading groups \n(headed  by  vice-governors)  to  monitor  timely  implementation  of  the  international  financial \ninstitutions-funded  projects  included  in  the  overall  reconstruction  plan  and  provide  policy \nguidance to the project management offices (PMOs). \n \n43.  Project  Level.  The  executing  agencies  (EAs)  will  be  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications  Department  in  Sichuan  province,  and  the  Hanzhong  and  Baoji  city \ngovernments in Shaanxi province. Each EA will establish a PMO, headed by a project director \nand  supported  by  a  team  specialized  in  project  management,  technical  aspects,  and \nenvironmental and social issues as required. The PMOs will be responsible for (i) providing day-\nto-day  assistance  and  guidance  to  the  project  IAs;  (ii)  consolidating  project  accounts; \n(iii) consolidating and submitting progress reports to ADB; (iv) conducting review of financial \nreports provided by the IAs; and (v) reviewing (a) compliance with specifications and plans, and \n(b) quality control by agencies undertaking reconstruction works. \n \n44.  Implementing Agencies. Sichuan Highway Administration Bureau (SHAB) will act as IA \nfor the roads in Sichuan province. County highway administration bureaus will act as IAs for the \nroads and bridges and county education bureaus as IAs for schools in the respective counties of \nShaanxi Province. The IAs will have PMOs for implementing and monitoring the subprojects. \nDetails of the PMOs are in Appendix 6.  \n \n45.  The IAs will be responsible for (i) implementing reconstruction works and activities; \n(ii) conducting detailed assessments, surveys, and planning of reconstruction, including public \nconsultation and input from recipient local entities and beneficiaries as required; (iii) preparation \nand  implementation  of  short  resettlement  plans,  as  required;  (iv)  prioritizing  works,  and \npreparing detailed designs, specifications, quantity schedules, bidding documents, contracts, \nand  related  documentation;  (v)  preparing  regular  progress  reports  for  ADB  through  the \nrespective EAs; and (vi) supervising construction, conducting quality control, approving progress \npayments to contractors, and maintaining records and accounts on an up-to-date basis and \nmaking these available to ADB, its missions, or auditors for inspection. The funds flow and \nproject implementation arrangements for Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces are in Appendix 6.  \n \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria, Approval, and Implementation \n \n46.  The  list  of  subprojects  for  ADB  support  was  finalized  after  taking  into  account: \n(i) consistency of project readiness and the timing of ADB funding, (ii) whether socioeconomic \nimpacts are of significant magnitude, (iii) whether a school or road section helps reduce the \nisolation  of  communities  (subprojects  that  reduce  isolation  will  be  given  priority),  and \n(iv) avoidance of roads or schools that have resettlement and adverse environmental impacts.15 \nAn initial list of subprojects was discussed during the reconnaissance mission, and then revised \nafter taking into account the above criteria during the loan fact-finding mission. However, if any \nsubproject is replaced during project implementation, it will be subject to prior review and \napproval  by  ADB  before  commencement.  The  procedures  for  selection,  approval,  and \nimplementation of subprojects are in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15 The local governments plan to reconstruct these roads using domestic funds because domestic procedures for \nland acquisition and environment approvals are much faster. \n ", "13 \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n \n47.  As the Project is for emergency assistance, implementation will start immediately after \napproval  and  be  completed  within  36  months.16 A  detailed  implementation  schedule  is  in \n \nAppendix 8. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n48.  Procurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  contemplated \nimplementation  schedule.  ADB\u2019s  procedure  for  providing  reconstruction  assistance  after \ndisasters allows for flexibility so that project activities can start promptly. National competitive \nbidding  procedures  will  be  the  preferred  mode  of  procurement.  The  local  procurement \nprocedures of the provincial governments are acceptable.  \n \n49.  Goods and related services estimated at more than $1 million will be procured following \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for \nprocurement of goods and related services estimated at between $100,000 and $1 million. For \nsmall, specialized equipment and materials contracts with a value of less than $100,000, direct \ncontracting acceptable to ADB will be followed. Due to the nature of this Project, the bidding \nperiod  for  international  competitive  bidding  will  be  shortened  to  30  days  and  for  national \ncompetitive bidding to 14 days. \n \n50.  Civil works contracts over $10 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding and those estimated to cost $10 million or less will be procured through the national \ncompetitive bidding procedure. Prequalification with single stage, one-envelope procedures for \ncomplex works, and using the existing contractor registration system or contractors previously \nprequalified for works of similar size and nature, is acceptable. Further, in order to effectively \nrespond to the urgent project needs, contracts estimated at less than $100,000 may be awarded \nto local contractors or those contractors who are working in the affected region on a direct \ncontracting basis at negotiated rates or at rates of ongoing contracts. Civil works estimated \nbetween $100,000 and $1 million may be awarded following shopping procedures by inviting a \nlimited number of registered or qualified contractors to participate in the bidding, including where \npracticable by advertising the invitation for bids in a national or provincial newspaper. ADB will \nconduct prior review of bidding documents, technical and price evaluation reports and award \nrecommendations for all packages estimated to cost over $10 million. For contracts estimated to \ncost $10 million or less, ADB will review and approve the first contracts for each implementing \nagency; post-facto approval procedures will follow if procurement procedures are satisfactory. \nHowever, if ADB determines at a later stage that its guidelines were not followed, ADB may \ndeclare misprocurement and not accept the award or terms of the contract, in which case the \nGovernment will be unable to use loan proceeds to finance the contract. If the loan proceeds \nhave  already  been  used  to  finance  such contracts  at  the  time  of  such  determination,  the \nGovernment will refund to ADB any such expenditure incurred. Rebidding and extending of bid \nvalidity will be subject to ADB prior approval. Community participation in the procurement of\n                                                 \n16 Given the number of subprojects in the transport sector and their remote locations, a 36-month implementation \nschedule under the ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy is considered appropriate. \n ", "14 \nsmall works of a simple nature is encouraged.17 The procurement plan is in Appendix 9 and the \ndetailed list of contract packages is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n51.  The Project will require a total of 1,698 person-months of national consulting services.18 \nThe construction supervision consultants will be hired to monitor project implementation of civil \nworks, environmental protection, resettlement, and project performance. The outline terms of \nreference  for  construction  supervision,  resettlement  monitoring,  and  project  performance \nmonitoring system data collection are in Appendix 10. Given the emergency nature of the \nprojects, the consultants will be recruited through single source selection. \n \n6.  Anticorruption \n \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or though its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EAs  and  IAs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n53.  The EAs will: (a) involve the agencies responsible for oversight of each IA in bidding and \nconstruction  in  order  to  monitor  construction  quality  control  and  supervise  effective  work; \n(b) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also signs an \nanticorruption  agreement  with  the  concerned  IA;  (c) periodically  inspect  the  contractors\u2019 \nactivities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; (d) support the PMOs and the IAs to \nensure good governance, accountability, and transparency in project operations; and (e) initiate \nliaison  meetings  with  the  relevant  agency,  as  needed,  to  discuss  any  warnings  about,  or \ninformation  on,  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject. The provincial governments will ensure that proper accounting and audit procedures \nare in place to ensure efficient and economic use of the ADB financing proceeds. Accounts and \nfinancial  statements  in  relation  to  the  Project  and  the  subprojects  will  be  maintained  and \ncertified by independent auditors acceptable to ADB.  \n \n7.  Advance Contracting \n \n54.  Given the Project\u2019s urgency, advance contracting was requested by the Government for \napproval for the procurement of goods, services, and civil works, and recruitment of consultants. \nThis request is supported and approved by the Management. The Government was advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of such advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n                                                 \n17 To encourage community participation and use of indigenous materials, methods to incorporate community \nparticipation in procurement may be used for rural and municipal infrastructure. Small works contracts with an \nestimated cost of $20,000 or less in each case may be awarded to community organizations in accordance with \npractices and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n18 Sichuan Province is allocated 1,404 person-months and Shaanxi Province 294 person-months of consulting \nservices. These will be provided through consulting services contracts for each province. \n ", "15 \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n55.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  quick \ndisbursement is essential for effective and timely emergency assistance. Given the emergency \nnature of the project and adequate financial management capacity in both Sichuan and Shaanxi \nprovincial financial bureaus, two imprest accounts (one for each province) will be established \nimmediately after loan effectiveness and operated by the respective provincial financial bureaus. \nThese imprest accounts will be set up in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The proceeds \nof the imprest advance will be released to the EAs when requested as reimbursement for \nexpenditures already incurred under the Project.   \n \n56.  The initial amount to be deposited into each of the imprest accounts will not exceed the \nlesser of (i) 6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from the imprest accounts, or (ii) \n20% of the loan amount. Procedures under ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government \nand  ADB,  including  the  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure,  will  be  adopted  for \nreimbursing  and  liquidating  eligible  expenditures.  Individual  payments  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  should  not  exceed  $200,000  per  payment,  unless \notherwise  agreed  with  ADB  during  project  implementation.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \noperated by the respective provincial financial bureau of each province, in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.   \n \n9.  Retroactive Financing \n \n57.  ADB has agreed to the provision of retroactive financing, up to a maximum of 25% of the \nloan proceeds, for reasonable eligible expenditures incurred and paid for after the occurrence of \nthe earthquake but not earlier than 12 months before the date of the loan agreement. The \nprovision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \na.  Reports  \n \n58.  The respective EAs will establish a reporting system for submitting quarterly progress \nreports  detailing  progress  relating  to  contract  awards,  disbursements,  and  project \nimplementation. These reports will provide feedback to management regarding procedures that \nmay need to be updated or improved, and will provide the basis for a consolidated quarterly \nreport to ADB. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the EAs will provide ADB \nan  overall  project  completion  report  providing  detailed  evaluation  of  project  design,  costs, \ncontractor and consultant performance, traffic counts, social and economic impacts, and other \ndetails requested by ADB. \n \n59.  Regular field reviews will be carried out by ADB together with the PMOs to monitor \nphysical  progress  of  subprojects  and  compliance  with  other  ADB  requirements  such  as \nprocurement, quality control, accounting, safeguards, and beneficiary participation. A midterm \nreview, to be conducted in 2010, will assess the need for changes in the implementation \narrangements to achieve the overall project objectives. \n \n \n \n ", "16 \nb.  Accounts and Audit \n \n60.  The Government will maintain separate records and accounts for the loan and imprest \naccounts. The provincial governments, operating through their respective PMOs, will establish \nand maintain separate records for subprojects, works, goods, and services financed out of loan \nproceeds  and  will  also  maintain  separate  project  accounts  in  accordance  with  generally \naccepted accounting principles for all expenditures incurred on the Project and subprojects from \nthe loan proceeds.  \n \n61.  Detailed consolidated annual project accounts, as maintained by the PMOs, will be \naudited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are \nacceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. \nThe annual audit report will include an audit of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure, and \nwill specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds through the imprest \naccounts, and compliance with SOE procedures. The EAs have been made aware of ADB\u2019s \npolicy and requirements relating to timely submission and quality of the audited accounts.  \n \nc.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n62.  The PMOs will establish a systematic project performance monitoring system. A set of \nperformance monitoring indicators are identified and included in Appendix 11. The baseline data \nestablished for each of the selected indicators will be incorporated in the project administration \nmemorandum, with additional data collected during implementation. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n63.  The  Government  requested  TA  grant  support  for  capacity  building  for  Wenchuan \nearthquake reconstruction. The TA grant support will have three components. TA for project \nimplementation will provide capacity-building support to the EAs and IAs for speedy and smooth \nimplementation, particularly with respect to procurement, disbursement, monitoring, and quality \ncontrol. TA for the education component will involve (i) establishment of two model schools, \nfocusing  on  information  and  communication  technology  and  on  natural  sciences; \n(ii) development of training materials, and provision of in-service training to teachers, including \nin areas such as student-centered learning; and (iii) teacher capacity building in the worst-\naffected counties. TA in the transport sector will build capacity regarding (i) road construction \nquality  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas,  and  (ii)  sustainable  rural  road  operation  and \nmaintenance systems. The details of the TA are in Appendix 12. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n64.  In Sichuan, about 3,500 km of rural roads have been identified for ADB financing in 19 of \nthe 39 severely affected counties. Within these 19 counties, 40% of the rural roads were \ndamaged.  The  ADB  project  will  reconstruct  and  upgrade  28%  of  the  damaged  roads.  In \nShaanxi,  317  km  of  rural  roads  and  more  than  50  bridges  have  been  identified  for  ADB \nfinancing in the four most severely affected counties, including 128 km of class III and 154 km of \nclass IV roads, and 35 km of village roads and bridges. \n \n65.  The economic benefits of the rural roads and bridges include (i) savings in vehicle \noperating costs as a result of improved traffic and road conditions, (ii) time savings for rural road \n ", "17 \nusers, (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents, and (iv) economic \nbenefits from generated traffic. The reconstruction and upgrading of rural roads in Sichuan and \nShaanxi will benefit about 5.6 million people, three-quarters of whom are rural; one-third are \npoor. Improved availability of reliable transport to markets will stimulate cash crop farming in \nremote or isolated areas, and broaden access to off-farm employment opportunities. Failure to \nreconstruct or upgrade rural roads will result in rural people in remote parts of the project area \nhaving less mobility; as a result, they will face greater difficulties in restoring their livelihoods \nafter the earthquake, and poor households in those regions will be unable to benefit from the \nbroader  economic  development.  In  addition,  the  reconstruction  will  provide  significant \nemployment and skill training benefits for rural people. \n \n66.  The Project also includes the reconstruction and upgrading of schools. The ADB Project \nwill focus on reconstruction and improvements for 12 schools, including six junior secondary \nand six primary schools. These will bring immediate benefits to the schools\u2019 16,600 students \n(including more than 8,000 females), and long-term benefits to future students among the \n460,000 residents of the areas serviced by the schools, about 40% of whom are from rural \nareas of these remote counties.  \n \n67.  The  Project  will contribute  to  the Government\u2019s  efforts  to  regenerate  the  economy, \nrehabilitate public infrastructure and utilities, and generate employment. The rehabilitation and \nreconstruction  of  damaged  schools  will  restore  the  provision  of  education  services. \nReconstruction  of  education  facilities  will  offer  long-term  benefits  for  APs  by  supporting \nopportunities for employment and participation in economic activities. Local communities and \nbeneficiaries will actively participate in the selection, design, implementation, and operation and \nmaintenance of all works carried out under the Project. The Project addresses the needs of \nvulnerable groups, including children in remote and poor areas. \n \n68.  The merging of selected schools in the three affected counties of Shaanxi under the \neducation component will lead to improved economies of scale and increased efficiency in \neducational expenditures in affected areas through savings in administrative, instructional, and \nother related educational costs. The schools that were damaged by the earthquake had old \nbuildings, poor toilets, and lacked facilities such as dormitories, reading rooms, and dining \nrooms, which was not conducive to learning. Construction of dormitory facilities adjacent to the \nreconstructed school buildings will enhance enrolment rates among students, including girls, in \nremote and mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province. Provision of ancillary facilities such as \nreading and dining rooms, multimedia laboratories, science laboratories, and more hygienic \ntoilets will make education more modern and enjoyable. \n \n69.  By establishing two model schools under the TA grant\u2014focusing on information and \ncommunication technology and on natural sciences\u2014the Project will develop a model that can \nbe replicated in other schools in the affected counties. Teachers will benefit from the training in \nstudent-centered methodologies that will be provided under the TA grant. Reconstruction of \nschools, provision of essential school equipment, and training of teachers in interactive learning \nand  other  modern  teaching  methodologies  will  demonstrate  new  approaches  that  can  be \nreplicated and will help the provincial government build a better education system in Shaanxi \nProvince.  \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Benefits \n \n70.  Eight of the 23 project counties (six in Sichuan and two in Shaanxi) are national poverty \ncounties.  The  Wenchuan  earthquake  brought  immense  suffering  to  many  rural  and  poor \n ", "18 \nhouseholds that were not equipped to deal with the disaster and the reconstruction efforts. \nConsequently, the government program has three reconstruction priorities: (i) housing, schools, \nand hospitals; (ii) rural infrastructure; and (iii) public buildings. The population of the 23 project \ncounties  is  12.1  million,  77%  of  whom  are  rural,  with  a  significant  proportion  below  the \ngovernment poverty line. There are 669 towns and townships and 7,753 administrative villages, \nincluding many poverty villages. Rural poverty results from remote and isolated locations, and a \nlack of access to transport, good farmland, good schools, and a water supply. There are some \nethnic minority villages located in three of the 23 counties, but none of the project roads, bridges, \nor schools are located in these ethnic minority villages. \n \n71.  The Project will bring benefits to the project area by (i) reconstructing and improving \nroad conditions and accessibility in townships and villages, (ii) reconstructing and improving \n12 schools in Shaanxi in compliance with seismic codes, and (iii) creating local employment \nopportunities from project construction and related activities. The Project will provide equal \nbenefits for women and girls through (i) improved rural roads, which will facilitate improved \ntransport services to remote mountain villages, which will in turn improve access to better health \nand  education  facilities;  and  (ii)  model  schools  with  improved  classrooms,  laboratories, \nwashrooms,  canteens,  and  dormitories.  Under  the  PRC's  compulsory  education  program \nprimary and junior secondary schools have no tuition fees, so girls have equal opportunity to \nattend school. Constructing schools complete with facilities will encourage people living in \nremote  locations,  where  suitable  school  education  is  not  available,  to  send  their  children \n(including  girls)  to  these  schools.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 13. \n \n72.  Rural  road  construction  will  support  enhanced  livelihoods  by  ensuring  all  rural \ncommunities have access to basic facilities, services and goods, and will help individuals and \nhouseholds manage risks by providing targeted employment. The program will provide for the \ndevelopment  of  quality  rural  access  infrastructure  and  a  mechanism  whereby  temporary \nemployment will provide a safety net for vulnerable rural people. The quality rural road network \nwill connect all villages to basic rural infrastructure and services such as markets, health care, \nand  schools.  It  will  provide  increased  employment  opportunities  by  using  labor-intensive \nmethods and a private sector-led approach for all works. The rural road program will enhance \nthe capacity of communities and the private sector to manage, deliver, and maintain public \ninfrastructure and transportation facilities through capacity development programs. The Project \nwill  build  capacity  for  earthquake-resistant  construction,  strengthened  local  government \nmechanisms,  encourage  gender  sensitization,  and  encourage  community-based  disaster \npreparedness programs. Safety will be enhanced through provision of higher geometric and \nstructural standards for roads and modern seismic-resistant building codes for schools. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n73.  Rural road reconstruction generally involves upgrading the width and quality of existing \nroads within the available rights-of-way. Based on the feasibility study investigation, no land \nacquisition or demolition of structures is anticipated for the roads in Sichuan. This will be \nconfirmed by the local land and resources bureaus once the designs are finalized. If land does \nneed to be acquired, it will require approval by the land and resources bureaus, in which case a \nresettlement plan will be prepared and submitted to ADB for review and concurrence. A small \namount of land may be occupied temporarily by contractors during construction; however, such \nland occupation will not be involuntary and the use of such land will also require approval from \nthe  land  and  resources  bureau.  Since  the  temporary  land  use  will  be  determined  during \n ", "19 \nconstruction, such use will be monitored and included in the external monitoring and evaluation \nreports.  \n \n74.  Four of the 10 rural road and bridge subprojects in Shaanxi will involve some land \nacquisition. Estimation of impacts and approval of land use procedures is currently underway, \nand will be finalized based on final designs. Resettlement plans for these four subprojects \n(Hanjiang  Bridge  in  Mian  Xian  County,  the  two  class  III  roads  in  Ningqing  County,  and \nShiyangmiao Qianhe Bridge in Chencang District) will be prepared by the IAs and submitted to \nADB for review and concurrence. The costs of land acquisition and resettlement are included in \nthe cost estimates of the relevant subprojects, and will be financed by the local governments.  \n \n75.  ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) key policy requirements and procedures \nfor preparing resettlement plans and conducting due diligence are set out in the resettlement \nframework (Appendix 14). Any resettlement plans for subprojects should be submitted to ADB \nfor  review  and  concurrence  prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition  for  that  particular \nsubproject. A national resettlement expert(s) acceptable to ADB will be engaged by the EAs. \nThe cost of the national resettlement expert will be included in the project cost and will be \nfinanced from the loan. The resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts  \n \n76.  Given the nature of the project\u2019s physical works (i.e., reconstruction of damaged road \nsections  and  school  buildings),  the  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The project component initial environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  have  been  provided  by  the  county  governments  on  the  basis  of \nenvironmental  assessment  documents  required  by  the  PRC\u2019s  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Law (2002). The Project\u2019s IEEs indicate that the Project is not expected to have \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts; any adverse environmental impacts will be mainly \nlimited to the construction stage. These impacts will be reversible in the short term and will \naffect a limited area, and are therefore manageable. The summary IEE is in Appendix 15 and \nthe environmental assessment and review framework is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nE.  Sustainability \n \n77.  A  key  selection  criterion  for  subprojects  to  be  financed  through  the  Project  is  an \nassessment of financial sustainability. This includes an assessment of availability of counterpart \nfinancing for implementation purposes as well as for future incremental recurrent costs. Based \non these arrangements and given the current macroeconomic environment, the Project is felt to \nbe financially sustainable. \n \nF.  Risks \n \n78.  To mitigate any lack of adequately strong commitment in implementing the Project in an \nefficient and timely manner, so that the earthquake-damaged or -destroyed education and \ntransport infrastructure is rehabilitated and reconstructed, the two provinces have each set up a \nhigh-level leading group chaired by the respective vice-governor for project monitoring.  \n \n79.  Implementation risks related to capacity for timely delivery of quality subprojects in the \nvarious project sectors will be mitigated in several ways. In terms of implementation supervision, \nspecific monitoring mechanisms will include regular financial audits as well as regular design \nand construction supervision. The two EAs will be supported in undertaking this supervision by \n ", "20 \ndedicated PMOs and consulting inputs. Another potential risk is the IAs\u2019 lack of experience with \nADB procedures. This will be mitigated through tailored training for the IAs on ADB procedures \nimmediately after the project-related TA becomes effective.

The damage and needs assessment undertaken by the Government and validated by \nthe technical assistance consultants1 noted that the Wenchuan earthquake caused extensive \ndamage and heavy losses in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, and some damage in \nseven other provinces. Many rural and urban houses collapsed, there was large-scale damage \nto infrastructure facilities and severe environmental destruction, and agriculture and industry \nsuffered heavy losses. The earthquake resulted in an uncommonly high number of hazardous \ngeologic events, such as landslides, rock falls, and debris flows, and created barrier lakes. The \ndisaster\u2019s total impact represents 3.3% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in FY 2007, and \nhad a significant impact on the economy of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Direct \neconomic losses caused by the Wenchuan earthquake are estimated at CNY852,309 million, \nand losses in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces are estimated at CNY845,136 million \n(99.16% of the total). In addition, indirect losses from the Wenchuan earthquake could be much \nhigher than estimated above, due to the nature and scale of the damage and loss incurred. \n \n2.  Losses equalled CNY771,770 million in Sichuan Province (91.32% of the total for the \nthree  provinces),  CNY50,535  million  (5.98%)  in  Gansu  Province,  and  CNY22,830  million \n(2.70%) in Shaanxi Province. Losses in the three provinces\u2019 social sectors were CNY465,275 \nmillion (55.05% of total losses), with CNY188,136 million in infrastructure losses (22.26% of \ntotal losses).  \n \nA.  Social Sector \n \n3.  Housing.  Numerous  houses  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  collapsed  during  the \nearthquake. The total damage to housing is CNY403,894 million, representing almost half of the \ntotal damage and losses, with damage concentrated within a 109,857 square kilometre (km2) \narea. More than half (57%) of the damaged housing was residential; damage to residential \nhousing in rural areas is estimated at CNY124,843 million, and in urban areas at CNY106,848 \nmillion. Most of the damage to the housing sector was concentrated in Sichuan Province, which \nincludes the 10 worst-affected districts and the 29 most seriously affected counties (cities or \ndistricts). These districts sustained CNY363,220 million in total damages, representing 90% of \nthe total damages caused by the Wenchuan earthquake. In addition, property losses suffered by \ncitizens in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces were reported to be CNY37,408 million.  \n \n4.  Education. A total of 17,951 educational institutions were fully or partially damaged in \nthe earthquake-affected areas, resulting in losses of CNY4,676 million, including CNY4,074 \nmillion in Sichuan, CNY541 million in Gansu, and CNY61 million in Shaanxi. There are 12,253 \ndamaged educational institutions in Sichuan Province, 5,455 in Shaanxi Province, and 243 in \nGansu Province. The counties with the most fully destroyed primary schools are Mao (153), \nPingwu (137), Wenchuan (129) and Beichuan (83); the jurisdictions with the greatest number of \naffected primary students are An County (121,905), Jiangyou City (98,923), Pengzhou City \n(90,819), and Dujiangyan City (79,701).

The network included 76,401 km of classified roads (66.6%): 1,758 km of expressways \n(1.5%); 1,496 km of class I roads (1.3%); 9,633 km of class II roads, (8.4%); and 63,514 km of \nclass III and IV roads (55.4%). The length of unclassified roads was 38,642 km.  \n \n2.  In 2005, the road network of Shaanxi Province was 54,491 km. Road density in Shaanxi \nwas 15.2 km per 100 km2, lower than national average. The network included 1,300 km of \nexpressways (2.4%); 359 km of class I roads (0.7%); 5,782 km of class II roads (10.6%); 14,657 \nkm of class III roads (26.9%), and 32,392 km of class IV and unclassified roads.  \n \n3.  Rural road development is a priority for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to achieve \nthe goal of a harmonious society. Rural roads are fundamental infrastructure that provide people \nwith basic access, help improve quality of life, assist in reducing poverty, and are essential for \neconomic development of rural communities. At present, the condition of many rural roads is \ninadequate,  most  sections  are  unpaved  and  they  are  not  designed  using  national  design \nstandards. Rural roads should be designed using a minimum of class IV road or special rural \nroad design standards. The State Council approved the Rural Road Development Plan in \nFebruary 2005. The overall objective of the plan is to make all townships and villages in the \nPRC accessible by paved roads by 2020, thereby forming a rural road network of a high service \nlevel, and making travel more rapid, safe, and comfortable for farmers. The goal is that by 2010, \n(i) all townships in the PRC will be connected by paved roads; (ii) all villages in eastern, central, \nand western regions will be connected to paved roads; and (iii) there will be 3.1 million km of \nrural roads.  \n \n4.  In the 11th Five-Year Plan, Sichuan plans to open a total of 11,250 km of new roads, \nproviding paved road connection for 90% of its townships. In addition, Shaanxi is planning \n10,000 km of rural road renovation and 28,000 km of new rural road construction to provide \npaved road connections for 450 townships and 5,600 villages in the province.  \n \n5.  The damage and needs assessment undertaken by the Government and validated by \nthe technical assistance (TA) consultants1 noted that the Wenchuan earthquake caused serious \ndamage to rural infrastructure, and that the damage to rural roads was particularly serious, with \n39,948 km of rural roads damaged, including 29,345 km in Sichuan, 3,189 km in Shaanxi, and \n7,414 km in Gansu (Table A3).  \n \nTable A3: Summary Damage to Rural Transport Infrastructure \n(km) \nItem  Total  Sichuan  Shaanxi  Gansu \nRural Roads  39,948   29,345   3,189   7,414  \nCounty Bus Stations  49  39  2  8 \nTownship Bus Stops  363  342  3  18 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: The State Overall Planning for Post-Wenchuan Earthquake Restoration and Reconstruction. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Providing Emergency Response to Sichuan \nEarthquake. Manila. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nB.  Project Objective \n \n6.  The rural road reconstruction will support Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces in restoring \nthe  livelihood  and  economic  activities  of  the  affected  population,  and  accelerate  poverty \nalleviation in the earthquake-affected areas that are vulnerable to a high poverty incidence. \n \n7.  Most damaged roads were constructed by villagers without proper design standards, \nand will be improved by the Project. The current pavement did not allow vehicles to operate \nproperly because of poor surface maintenance. The width of some sections was insufficient to \nallow two-way traffic, and drainage systems were not properly designed and of insufficient \ncapacity for the anticipated (design) rainfall intensity. Many slopes were not protected. The \nnational  highway  design  standards  and  seismic  codes  will  be  employed  during  road \nreconstruction, and the higher design standards will provide faster, safer, and easier access to \nmarkets  and  public  services  for  villagers,  and  entail  lower  maintenance  costs  for  local \ngovernments.   \n \nC.  Reconstruction Planning and Design  \n \n8.  All roads are part of the overall reconstruction plan approved by the State Council and \nthe provincial rural road network planned for reconstruction. The new alignment is planned on \nthe  original  right-of-way.  These  roads  will  adopt  higher  design  standards,  and  the  design \nstandards of most roads is class III or IV, with a few class II standard roads. The minimum \npavement width is 4.5 meters (m) for sections with one-way traffic. The minimum shoulder width \nis 0.25 m (to be installed on both sides).  Drainage will be designed using rainfall intensity of 5-\nyear recurrence. Slope protection such as retaining walls will be installed where needed. Traffic \nsafety equipment such as road marking and signs will be installed.  \n \nD.  Construction Quality \n \n9.  To ensure the construction quality, the civil works contractors will be provided clear \ninstructions in the bidding documents and their activities will be supervised. The civil works \nbidding document, including technical specifications, will be prepared by the design consultant, \nand  will  describe  the  construction  method,  construction  material  quality,  site  management \nrequirements, and environmental protection measures. The civil works will be supervised under \nthe  2004  Rural  Road  Construction  Quality  Control  Ordinance  and  the  2007  Supervision \nSpecifications  for  Construction  of  Highway  Engineering,  as  prepared  by  the  Government. \nAccordingly, implementing agencies will designate qualified construction supervisors, who will \nreside on site and will monitor all civil works activities to ensure adequate construction methods, \nquality of material, construction safety, and environmental protection. The supervisors\u2019 activities \nwill be documented and will be reported periodically to the implementing agencies.  \n \nE.  Maintenance \n \n10.  A  rural  road  maintenance  system  was  being  established  before  the  Wenchuan \nearthquake. The Government provided guidelines on rural road maintenance reform in 2005, \nunder which provincial governments would establish their own rural road maintenance systems. \nThe county governments are primarily responsible for rural road maintenance. The county \ngovernments  prepare  maintenance  plans,  bear  maintenance  costs,  supervise  maintenance \nactivities, and organize township and village governments\u2019 road maintenance activities. Annual \nmaintenance cost are budgeted at CNY15,000 per km for county roads, CNY6,000 per km for \ntownship  roads,  and  CNY1,000  per  km  for  village  roads.  These  are  funded  by  a  road \n ", "Appendix 3  31\nmaintenance fee. Municipal governments provide subsidies for a periodic maintenance budget \nwhen needed. According to the national guidelines, rural road maintenance is being outsourced. \nMany  counties  have  already  hired  private  companies  for  rural  road  maintenance  through \ncompetitive bidding, which is carried out every 3 years. After the project road reconstruction, \nrural roads will be maintained adequately using the prevailing maintenance system in the two \nprovinces.  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \nSOCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  Prior to the earthquake (at the end of 2007), Shaanxi Province had 18,953 primary and \nsecondary education facilities, which were adequate to serve the population of around 37 \nmillion, and provided coverage to the province\u2019s urban and rural population.  \n \n2.  The damage and needs assessment undertaken by the Government and validated by \nthe technical assistance (TA) consultants1 noted that the extent of damage to the education \nsector was high and the buildings were not designed to an appropriate seismic code. Sichuan \nand Shaanxi are among the worst-affected provinces. In the earthquake-affected areas, 17,951 \neducational institutions were fully or partially damaged, including 12,253 in Sichuan Province, \n5,455 in Shaanxi Province and 243 in Gansu Province. Many of these schools are at risk of \ncollapsing  as  they  have  sustained  significant  damage.  These  losses  have  resulted  in  a \nsignificant disruption of both primary and secondary education services. The affected schools \noccupy 3.65 million square meters (m2) and the economic losses in Shaanxi's education sector \nconstitute CNY2.2 billion. \n \n3.  Educational institutions of all levels, from primary schools to degree colleges, have \nsuffered substantial damage. The earthquake affected 40 counties of Shaanxi Province, and \nthree counties\u2014Chencang, Lueyang, and Mian Xian\u2014were particularly hard hit. In Shaanxi, \n5,455 schools (about 25% of all schools) were damaged during the earthquake. It is reported \nthat 11 students died, and 221 students and 10 teachers were injured. A summary of damage to \neducational institutions is in Table A4.1. \n \nTable A4.1: Summary of Damage to Compulsory Educational Institutions in Shaanxia \nTotal Number of  Number of Damaged \nInstitution \nInstitutions  Institutions  \nPrimary School   16,316   4,181 \nJunior Secondary School  2,001  882 \nSenior Secondary School  636   184 \n  Total  18,953  5,247 \na  Data is not available for technical secondary schools, vocational schools, special schools, and higher \neducational institutions. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  The  Government  responded  quickly  to  the  earthquake  emergency.  In  Shaanxi,  the \nGovernment has provided temporary teaching facilities in heavily affected areas in the form of \nmetal tents, where teaching and learning has continued. In addition, the Government organized \ntraining targeted for head teachers in affected schools on how to run schools, and how to teach \nstudents in emergency situations. The Government has plans to reconstruct 731 schools in 38 \ncounties  of  Shaanxi,  which  will  cost  CNY5.7  billion  and  will  occupy  4.51  million  m2. \nReconstruction will be carried out in batches over 2009\u20132010. Reconstruction of the first batch \nof education facilities has already begun. The Government is financing the reconstruction of 117 \nschools, including 63 primary and 51 junior secondary schools, occupying 0.84 million m2 at a \ntotal cost of CNY1.65 billion. However, the education reconstruction needs are enormous and \nwill take a substantial amount of time and resources to complete. \n \n5.  The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to finance reconstruction of 12 partly and completely destroyed high-\npriority government school buildings in Shaanxi\u2019s three worst-affected counties of Chencang, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Providing Emergency Response to Sichuan \nEarthquake. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 4  33\nLueyang, and Mian Xian. Immediate restoration of education facilities in the worst-affected \ncounties will benefit students, parents, teachers, and communities.  \n \n6.  Lueyang county has 120 educational institutions (consisting of eight kindergartens, 94 \nprimary schools, 11 junior secondary schools, one senior secondary school, one secondary \ntechnical school, one complex school2 and one teacher training college), which serve 24,511 \nstudents. The earthquake has caused different degrees of damage to primary and secondary \nschools in the county.3 There are 138 educational institutions in Mian Xian county (including six \nkindergartens, 113 primary schools, one compulsory complex school,4 11 junior secondary \nschools,  one  senior  secondary  school,  one  complex  secondary  school,5 one  secondary \ntechnical school and one teacher training college); enrolment is 25,511 students, and there are \n1,995 teachers. The earthquake damaged 132 of Mian Xian county\u2019s schools. There are 273 \nschools in Chencang county, including 213 primary schools, 43 junior secondary and eight \nsenior  schools,  one  special  school  and  one  teacher  training  college;  91,486  students  are \nenrolled, and 6,218 teachers work in the county. The earthquake damaged 176 schools with a \ntotal area of 12.6 million m2, and 67,521 students were affected to differing degrees by the \nearthquake.   \n \nB.  Objective \n \n7.  The objective of this component is to contribute to reversing the devastating impact of \nthe Wenchuan earthquake and to enable people to resume and improve their livelihoods and \nreturn to normal life. The education component will focus on reconstructing and rehabilitating 12 \nhigh-priority schools. Reconstructing the schools early would ensure that disruption to provision \nof education services is minimized.  \n \n8.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  12  high-priority  earthquake-damaged \neducation facilities in the three worst-affected counties in Shaanxi Province. Reconstruction will \nadopt improved earthquake-resistant design. Some essential furniture and equipment will also \nbe procured for selected reconstructed and repaired schools. A general principle of \u201cbuild back \nbetter\u201d will be followed and rebuilt schools will be better of better quality and design, and include \nancillary facilities\u2014such as dormitories, dining rooms, reading rooms, and toilet facilities\u2014as \npart of new construction. \n \n9.  This approach is advocated in the short-term recovery strategy recommended in the \ndamage  and  needs  assessment  and  agreed  with  the  Government.  By  financing  the  most \nurgently  needed  components  and  works,  the  ADB  loan  will  support  a  portion  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  program,  provide  assistance  to \nvulnerable groups, help restore the economic activity essential to the survival of residents in the \nheavily  affected  areas,  and  restore  and  improve  the  provision  of  education  services. \nReconstructed schools with improved seismic designs and improved teaching and learning \nfacilities will serve as model schools for the reconstruction of the remaining damaged and \naffected schools that require rebuilding and repair.  \n \n10.  The selection of the various education facilities under the Project is based on the needs \nassessment  exercise  undertaken  and  the  priorities  determined  by  the  Shaanxi  provincial \ngovernment. The selection is based on the following criteria: \n \n \n                                                 \n2  One school that covers grades 1\u201312. \n3  Three hundred and sixty-five classrooms collapsed.  \n4  One school that covers grades 1\u20139. \n5  One school that covers grades 7\u201312. \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \n(i)  education facilities are located in the earthquake affected zone in Shaanxi; \n(ii)  the work address the basic emergency needs in the affected areas; \n(iii)  subprojects  are  considered  a  priority  for  ADB  assistance  by  the  Shaanxi \nprovincial government; and \n(iv)  subprojects are technically feasible, cost efficient, and financially sustainable. \n \n11.  TA grant support will be provided for capacity building to support the operation of the \nnew  schools  through  establishment  of  model  schools,  training  of  master  teachers,  and \nassistance to the Shaanxi Bureau of Education to reestablish the education system in the worst-\naffected counties. Grant support will involve (i) establishment of two model schools, focusing on \ninformation and communication technology and on natural sciences; (ii) needs assessment and \ndevelopment of training materials; and (iii) provision of in-service training to teachers, including \nin areas such as student-centered and active learning. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n12.  The cost of the education subcomponent is estimated at $24.4 million.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Hanzhong and Baoji city governments will be the executing agencies (EAs) for the \neducation  component.  County  education  bureaus  in  Chencang,  Lueyang,  and  Mian  Xian \ncounties will be the implementing agencies (IAs). Leading groups have been set up at the three \ncounties to oversee implementation. The county-level IAs will undertake overall management of \nthe  education  component,  including  (i)  procurement  of  civil  works  and  equipment,  (ii) \nsupervision of construction for quality assurance, (iii) coordination with other departments and \nline agencies, (iv) monitoring, and (v) audit of accounts and preparation of progress reports. The \nIAs will undertake procurement under the oversight of the county leading groups, which will \ninclude finance bureau representation. The IAs will be responsible for (i) preparation of the \nlayout  for  primary  and  secondary  schools,  including  detailed  engineering  with  seismic \n ", "Appendix 4  35\nprovisions, bid preparation, assistance in procurement, supervision/contract administration of \ncivil works, quality assurance of civil works, and procurement of equipment; and (ii) project \nmanagement and reporting.  \n \nE.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n15.  The EAs will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports detailing the progress of \ncontract awards, disbursement, and project implementation, based on the reports prepared by \nthe IAs. In addition, regular field reviews will be carried out by ADB together with the EAs and \nIAs to monitor physical progress of civil works for quality assurance and compliance with other \nADB  requirements  such  as  procurement,  accounting  and  consultation/participation  of \nnongovernment organizations and communities, as applicable. \n \n16.  The Government will maintain separate records and accounts for the loan and imprest \naccounts. The EAs, operating through their respective project monitoring offices (PMOs), will \nestablish and maintain separate records for subprojects, works, goods and services financed \nout of the loan proceeds. Detailed consolidated annual project accounts as maintained by PMO \nwill be audited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference \nare acceptable to ADB and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal \nyear. \n \n17.  A  set  of  performance  monitoring  indicators,  including  qualitative  indicators,  will  be \nidentified and collected during implementation, and the PMOs will implement the necessary \narrangements for a systematic project performance monitoring system. \n \nF.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n18.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  rebuild  the  economy, \nrehabilitate public infrastructure and utilities, and generate employment. The rehabilitation and \nreconstruction of damaged schools will restore disrupted education services. Reconstruction of \neducation facilities will offer long-term benefits for affected persons by supporting opportunities \nfor employment and participation in economic activities. Local communities and beneficiaries \nwill actively participate in the selection, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance \nof all works carried out under the Project. The Project addresses the needs of vulnerable \ngroups, including children in remote and poor areas. \n \n19.  The merging of selected schools in the three affected counties of Shaanxi under the \neducation component will improve economies of scale and increase the efficiency of educational \nexpenditures in affected areas through savings in administrative, instructional and other related \neducational costs. Construction of dormitory and ancillary facilities adjacent to the reconstructed \nschool buildings will enhance enrolment rates among students in remote and mountainous \nareas of Shaanxi Province.   \n \n20.  By  establishing  two  model  schools,  focusing  on  information  and  communication \ntechnology and on natural sciences, the Project will develop a model that can be replicated in \nother schools in the affected counties. Teachers will benefit from the training in student-centered \nmethodologies that will be provided under the grant. Reconstruction of schools, provision of \nessential school equipment, and training of teachers in interactive learning and other modern \nteaching methodologies will help the provincial government build a better education system in \nShaanxi Province.  \n \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES  3\n6\n   \n \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates of Sichuan Rural Road    \n \n \n($ million)a    \n \nA\n  p\np\ne\nn\nCost  ADB  Government  d\nix\nItem   5 \n% of Cost  % of Cost \n$  $  $ \nCategoryb  Category \nA.

National consultants will be recruited to supervise construction activities. The consultant \nsupervision team will be composed of qualified engineers, with at least 5 years of practical \nexperience in supervision and administration of road and building construction. Construction \nsupervision activities will include the following:  \n \n(i)  assist the IA with contractors\u2019 applications for subcontracting parts of the civil \nworks, by reviewing ambiguities and discrepancies in contract documents, and \nsettling disputes with contractors; \n(ii)  ensure that all required data for setting out the civil works are provided; \n(iii)  help  the  IA  with  drawing  quality,  and  advise  the  IA  on  further  drawing  or \ninstructions to the contractors; \n(iv)  assist  the  IA  in  reviewing  the  contractors\u2019  organizational  arrangements,  key \npersonnel and construction programs, materials, and sources of materials; \n(v)  monitor the progress of the works against programmed targets, advise the IA on \nmeasures to be taken to improve progress and quality, review and advocate \nproposed variation orders, determine rates for works, and decide on alternatives; \n(vi)  inspect the quality of the works in terms of workmanship and compliance with \nspecifications, including the seismic code; order, supervise, or perform tests on \nmaterials and civil works; advise on approval or disapproval of the contractors\u2019 \nplan and equipment; propose, if required, the uncovering of completed civil works \nand the removal and replacement of improper material and works; \n(vii)  check the progress of civil works, examine and review sampling measurements \nof any work that is about to be covered or put out of view before permanent work \nis placed thereon, examine the measurements of the completed civil works, and \n(as directed by the IA) order the initiation of additional civil works that are part of \nthe contract; \n(viii)  supervise the contractors in all matters concerning safety and environmental \nprotection; and \n(ix)  examine the contractors\u2019 accounts, invoices, claims, and other statements for \nerrors in complying with the contract, and suggest and make corrections.  \n                                                 \n1  Construction  supervision,  including  environmental  monitoring  needs,  1,368  person-months;  resettlement \nmonitoring and PPMS data collection needs, 36 person-months.  \n2  Construction supervision, including environmental monitoring needs, 288 person-months; resettlement monitoring \nand PPMS data collection needs, 6 person-months. \n ", "Appendix 10  49\n3.  Resettlement due diligence monitoring will be carried out by a national consultant and \ninvolves two tasks: (i) annual investigations and reporting on subprojects that have resettlement \nimpacts in accordance with the terms of reference appended to the resettlement framework, and \n(ii) conducting due diligence for other subprojects to ensure there are no resettlement impacts. \nBefore construction commencement, the consultant will confirm with the relevant county land and \nresources bureau whether the subprojects involve any land acquisition and resettlement. During \nconstruction,  the  consultant  will  periodically  visit  project  sites  to  ensure  that  there  are  no \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. The consultant will include the findings of due diligence in the \nannual resettlement monitoring and evaluation reports to be submitted to the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the executing agencies (EAs). If the consultants find any unanticipated land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts, they will inform the IA, the EA, and ADB immediately. The \nIA will be required to either (i) avoid resettlement impacts, or (ii) prepare a short resettlement plan \nfor submission to ADB. Before the civil works commencement at the resettlement site impact \narea, the resettlement plan should be forwarded to ADB for approval after endorsement by the IA.  \n \n4.  National consultants recruited to develop and implement the PPMS will collect and \nanalyze  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project  performance  against  project  objectives, \npurposes,  and  outputs.  A  baseline  survey  will  be  conducted  at  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation, and follow-up surveys at project completion, and 1 year and 3 years after \ncompletion. Data collected during and after implementation will be compared with the baseline \ndata and the target values to be established by the EA and agreed upon with ADB before the \nworks start.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide a $400 million loan to fund reconstruction in Sichuan and \nShaanxi,  two  of  the  worst  earthquake-affected  provinces  in  the  PRC.  The  Emergency \nAssistance for Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction Project will provide $300 million for rural \nroad reconstruction in Sichuan Province and $100 million for reconstruction of rural roads and \nbridges and primary and middle schools in Shaanxi Province. The Project seeks to (i) build on \nthe  immediate  relief  provided  by  the  Government  in  the  earthquake-affected  provinces; \n(ii) contribute to coordinated rehabilitation and reconstruction by different development partners \nand the Government; and (iii) specifically address sustainable recovery priorities by providing \nindirect livelihood support through public infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction, which \ngenerates  public  employment  and  underpins  the  restoration  of  livelihood  activities  by \nrehabilitating roads, bridges, and schools. The Government also requested grant support for \ncapacity  building  for  project  implementation,  and  the  Project\u2019s  education  and  transport \ncomponents. The technical assistance (TA) will assist in ensuring smooth and speedy project \nimplementation, and provide support to the transport and education investment components. \n \nB.  Scope \n \n2.  The  TA  grant  support  will  have  three  components.  The  project  implementation \ncomponent will provide capacity-building support to the executing and implementing agencies \nfor  speedy  and  smooth  implementation,  particularly  regarding  procurement,  disbursement, \nmonitoring,  and  quality  control.  The  TA  for  the  education  component  will  involve \n(i) establishment of two model schools, focusing on information and communication technology \nand on natural sciences; (ii) development of training materials, and provision of in-service \ntraining to teachers, including in areas such as student-centered learning; and (iii) teacher \ncapacity building in the worst-affected counties. In the transport sector, the TA will provide \ncapacity building  regarding (i) the provision of guidance regarding road construction quality in \nremote and mountainous areas, and (ii) sustainable rural road operation and maintenance \nsystems.  \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n3.  Individual consultants will be hired to implement the TA. For the project implementation \ncomponent, the consultants will assist the executing agencies (EAs) and the implementing \nagencies (IAs) in project implementation, project monitoring, and reporting. The consultants will \nprovide capacity-building support to the staff of the EAs and IAs and the project monitoring \noffices  regarding  ADB  procedures  on  procurement,  safeguards,  project  performance  and \nreporting. They will also help in establishing the initial project implementation system and train \nstaff in its operation. For the education component, the consultants will provide capacity-building \nsupport to the teachers in the affected counties, develop the training materials for student-\ncentered learning, and help in establishing the two model schools, including procuring the \nnecessary equipment for information and communication technology and science laboratories. \nThey will work closely with the EAs and IAs to develop the curriculum for teaching disaster \npreparedness in the schools and carrying out mock drills for safe evacuation in emergencies. \nFor the transport component, the consultants will review current construction techniques and \nmethods  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas,  compare  these  with  the  existing  seismic  and \nbuilding  codes,  and  recommend  practices  that  can  be  adopted  in  the  road  and  bridge \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nconstruction. The consultants will also review the operation and maintenance system for the \nrural roads and recommend possible options that can be adopted by local governments to \nestablish a sustainable and reliable operation and maintenance system for the rural roads. \nCapacity-building support in the form of training will be provided for all the three components. \nWorkshops and seminars will be organized to disseminate the TA findings. The TA will be \nundertaken in close consultation with the EAs, IAs, local and provincial governments, and other \nstakeholders.  The  study  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  policy  dialogue  and  will  consider  all \nprevious studies by the Government, ADB, the World Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies.  \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n4.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000. The Government has requested that \nADB  finance  $700,000  and  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000,  which  will  cover  office \naccommodation and the counterpart staff required to implement the TA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n5.  For  the  project  implementation  and  transport  components,  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications Department, and Hanzhong and Baoji city governments will be the EAs; for the \neducation component, Hanzhong and Baoji city governments will be the EAs. The consultants \nwill work closely with the EAs. The EAs will provide adequate counterpart staff with relevant \nwork  experience  during  implementation,  arrange  meetings,  and  coordinate  with  concerned \ngovernment agencies to facilitate the work of the consultants.  \n ", "Appendix 12  53\n6.  TA implementation arrangements will provide flexibility to allow adjustment in consultant \nterms of reference, and the duration and schedule of expert inputs. ADB will recruit a national \nconsultant who will work as the TA coordinator and will supervise and coordinate day-to-day TA \nactivities, including monitoring progress, resolving problems, arranging meetings, and liaising \nwith the government agencies concerned. The TA coordinator will submit monthly reports to \nADB  on  TA  implementation  progress.  The  project  implementation  component  will  require \nrecruitment  of  four  national  consultants  with  expertise  in  ADB  procedures  and  project \nimplementation; the education component will require recruitment of three national consultants \nwith expertise in teachers training, information and communication technology education, and \nscience  education;  and  the  transport  component  will  require  recruitment  of  two  national \nconsultants with expertise in rural road construction and maintenance. Consultants will be \nengaged by ADB as individuals, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of consultants. ADB may consider direct selection of qualified national and/or \ninternational organizations, local institutions, and/or short-term resource persons, where justified \nby efficacy, efficiency, and/or urgency in completing activities. To facilitate the work of the \nconsultants, and to ensure that the EAs benefits from their experience, the EAs will provide \nadequate counterpart staff with relevant work experience during TA implementation.  \n \n7.  To respond quickly to urgent and evolving needs, procurement of goods under the TA \nwill incorporate greater flexibility. Unless otherwise agreed upon by ADB, the project monitoring \noffices will procure all goods in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). To expedite delivery, shopping and national competitive bidding \nwith abbreviated bidding periods will be applied, as considered appropriate, to procure the \nagreed-upon goods. To ensure timely provision of goods and services, an advance payment \nfacility will be established. All TA funds will be disbursed and the advance payment facility will \nbe established in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008).  \n \n8.  The TA will be implemented from March 2009 to October 2011. In view of the nature of \nthe disaster, TA reviews will carefully assess implementation arrangements and approaches, \nand appropriate adjustments will be instituted as needed. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry and Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Emergency Assistance for Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction \nProject \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  East Asia Department/ \nProject \u2013 emergency loan \nModality:  Division:  Transport Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  The emergency assistance project will support the reconstruction or upgrading of about 3,500 kilometers of rural roads in \nSichuan Province and about 317 kilometers of rural roads and 12 schools in Shaanxi Province. The loan will alleviate the \ntransport problems caused by the earthquake and will improve the quality of the schools, which will indirectly facilitate poverty \nreduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General invention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Wenchuan earthquake brought immense suffering to many rural and poor households that were not prepared to deal with \nthe disaster and the reconstruction efforts. The population of the 23 project counties is 12.1 million, 77% of whom are rural; \nmany are below the government poverty line. Of the 23 project counties, 8 (6 In Sichuan and 2 in Shaanxi) are national \npoverty counties. Rural poverty results from remote and isolated locations, and a lack of access to transport, good farmland, \ngood schools, and a water supply. \n \n2.  Design Features  \nReconstruction or Rehabilitation of Road in Affected Counties and Townships. In Sichuan, the rural road reconstruction \nand rehabilitation will directly benefit about 5.0 million residents in 19 affected counties; three-quarters of whom are rural, and \none-third of whom are poor. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of rural roads in Shaanxi will benefit about 600,000 people, \nthree-quarters of whom are rural and one-third of whom are poor. Improved availability of reliable transport to markets will \nstimulate cash crop farming in remote or isolated areas, and broaden access to off-farm employment opportunities. Failure to \nreconstruct or upgrade rural roads will result in rural people in the remote parts of the project area having less mobility; they \nwill consequently face greater difficulties in restoring their livelihoods after the earthquake, and poor households in those \nregions will not be able to benefit from the broader economic development. \nReconstruct and Improve Schools in Affected Towns and Villages. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Project will focus \non reconstruction and improvements for 12 model schools, including six junior secondary and six primary schools. These will \nbring immediate benefits to the schools\u2019 16,800 students (including more than 8,000 female students), and long-term benefits \nto future students among the 460,000 residents of the area serviced by the schools, about 40% of whom are from rural areas \nof these remote counties. Two of the three project areas are poverty counties. \nCreate Employment Opportunity under the Project. It is estimated that 115,000 unskilled workers from the local areas will \nbe required for an average of 6 months of labor during the reconstruction of the rural roads and schools. Each worker is \nestimated to earn CNY1,000 per month, with a total income benefit of CNY690 million. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe Wenchuan earthquake brought immense suffering to many rural and urban people in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu \nprovinces. Therefore, the government program has set three priorities for reconstruction: (i) housing, schools, and hospitals; \n(ii) rural infrastructure; and (iii) public buildings. There are 669 towns/townships and 7,573 administrative villages that will \nbenefit directly from the proposed reconstruction activities. The ADB emergency loan assistance is part of a much larger \nreconstruction  program  that  is  designed  to  restore  and  improve  the  people\u2019s  living  conditions  and  livelihoods.  The \nimplementation is coordinated by leading groups to ensure the investments are channeled through local governments, and \nprojects are implemented in an efficient and effective manner to benefit the affected persons (APs). \n \n ", "Appendix 13  55\nB. Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThis is an emergency assistance and the proposed reconstruction of roads and schools is a priority for the APs and the local \ngovernments. A damage and needs assessment has been conducted based on investigations with all key stakeholders. ADB \nfielded a reconnaissance and fact-finding mission and extensive consultations were held with local governments, APs, \ntransport users, and school teachers and children. The ADB loan is part of a larger reconstruction effort; planning has been \ncoordinated with the various stakeholders for the benefit of the APs. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe Government has taken the lead role in the relief and reconstruction efforts, but the involvement of the local people is \nessential for successful rehabilitation. Although many APs are still working to restore their living conditions and livelihoods, if \nwilling they can participate in the reconstruction of the rural roads and schools. However, most APs expect the government to \nrestore the roads and schools as quickly as possible. \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe reconstruction of rural roads and schools will equally benefit women and girls. \n \n2.

The proposed Emergency Assistance for Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction Project \nwill  support  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  the  areas  affected  by  the  Wenchuan \nearthquake, which caused extensive damages in 39 counties of Sichuan Province, four counties \nof Shaanxi Province, and eight counties of Gansu Province. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will assist the reconstruction and upgrading of (i) rural roads in 19 counties of Sichuan \nProvince; and (ii) rural roads, bridges, and schools in four counties of Shaanxi Province. The \nreconstruction and upgrading works will be implemented over 3 years, from 2009 to 2011. \n \n2.  In Sichuan, about 3,500 kilometers of rural roads have been identified by the country \ntransport bureaus and approved by the Sichuan Provincial Highway Administration Bureau, \nunder the Sichuan Provincial Communications Department. All are existing roads which were \ndamaged by the Wenchuan earthquake; they will be reconstructed and some will be upgraded \nfollowing the original alignment. Some road sections will also require new bridges, and the \nstandards and alignments for these may be modified slightly. Therefore, although the selection \ncriteria includes avoiding those road sections with land acquisition, there could still be some \nsmall amounts of land acquisition and possibly some house demolition. \n \n3.  In Shaanxi, 317 kilometers of rural roads have been identified by the county transport \nbureaus  and  approved  by  the  Shaanxi  Provincial  Highway  Administration  Bureau  for \nreconstruction. All are existing roads that were damaged by the Wenchuan earthquake; they will \nbe reconstructed and some will be upgraded following the original alignment. Some new bridges \nwill be constructed to connect the existing roads. The feasibility studies indicate that two road \nsubprojects and two bridge subprojects will require some land acquisition and possibly some \nhouse  demolition.  In  addition,  12  schools  in  Shaanxi  have  been  identified  by  the  county \neducation  bureaus  for  complete  or  partial  reconstruction  and  improvement.  Most  of  the \neducation subprojects will require no land or very small amounts of land (with the exception of \ntwo schools, for which due diligence will be conducted and reported by an independent expert). \n \n4.  A resettlement framework has been formulated to address potential land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts caused by the project activities. The total number of affected persons (APs) \nis not known at this time, but few if any structures will need to be demolished. At most, small \nstrips of land may be required for road widening or straightening, or for bridge construction. \nThese impacts will be measured, recorded and reported in the subproject resettlement plans. \nSince land acquisition is very minor, there will be no significant impacts on the livelihoods of \nAPs. Therefore, cash compensation based on replacement value will be adequate to address \nthe small losses.  \n \n5.  Subprojects are being selected by the implementing agencies (IAs) and approved by the \nexecuting agencies (EAs), based on selection criteria agreed upon with ADB. The IAs will do \ntheir best to avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. In Sichuan, further \nscreening  of  subprojects  for  resettlement  due  diligence  will  be  conducted  by  an  external \nresettlement monitor/expert. Based on this due diligence, the total number of subprojects that \nrequire short resettlement plans can be determined. In Shaanxi, four transport subprojects \n(Hanjiang  Bridge  in  Mian  Xian  County,  the  two  class  III  roads  in  Ningqiang  County,  and \nShiyangmiao  Qianhe  Bridge  in  Chencang  District)  will  have  some  land  acquisition.  Short \nresettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  by  the  IAs  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works  for  those  subprojects  that  have  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. \n \n6.  For school reconstruction, Gou Town No. 1 Middle School involves 40 mu of vacant \nconstruction land and Chencang Experimental Primary School has already acquired 40 mu of \nfarmland. Therefore, a due diligence report needs to be prepared by the IA for these two \nschools and submitted to ADB for review; if there are any remaining issues, a retrofit plan will be \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nprepared and submitted to ADB for review and concurrence. The due diligence report will be \nsubmitted to ADB by 31 March 2009, covering the Chencang Primary School, and the Gouzhen \nMiddle School. \n \n7.  For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China Land Administration Law \n(1998) and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The EAs will ensure that any people \nlosing land, housing, other assets or income sources will be assisted to fully restore their \nincome and living standards. Those people losing land temporarily during construction will \nreceive a payment equivalent to production value foregone for the period of loss, which is \nexpected to be 2 years, and land will also be restored by the contractor to the original condition. \n \n8.  If any structures need to be demolished, replacement value will be provided to the \naffected rural households based on compensation rates adopted in each county. Those losing \nhousing will be able to acquire new housing sites close to a road, electricity and water services \nwithin the current village group or administrative village. There will be no reduction in house \ncompensation for depreciation, and people can salvage materials from their old houses. \n \n9.  The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement has not yet been finalized, but these \ncosts are included in the subproject costs estimates. The source of funding for land acquisition \nand resettlement will be entirely financed by local governments. During project construction, if \nthere are significant material changes in project scope or other causes, a new or an updated \nresettlement plan will prepared, disclosed to APs and submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to \nimplementation of such changes. \n \n10.  The  county  communications  bureaus  or  the  county  education  bureaus  will  be \nresponsible for planning and implementing project land acquisition and resettlement, and any \nrelated  resettlement  management  work.  The  county  land  and  resources  bureaus  will  be \nresponsible for the land acquisition and resettlement procedures, agreements and payments. \nThey will (i) issue formal notifications to APs; (ii) complete the formal land transfer procedures in \na  timely  manner;  (iii)  document  and  resolve  grievances  relating  to  land  acquisition, \ncompensation and resettlement; and (iv) ensure land used temporarily is returned to original \nuser and restored by the contractors to the original or improved condition.  \n \n11.  During  the  process  of  formulating  the  resettlement  plans  and  subsequent \nimplementation, the relevant authorities will consult with and encourage the participation of the \nAPs. Also, resettlement plans must be disclosed to affected villages and individual APs prior to \nsubmission to ADB. The resettlement plans should be placed in the local government and \nvillage offices and made publicly available. The resettlement plans will also be posted on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \n12.  During  project  implementation,  if  any  APs  are  dissatisfied  with  compensation, \nconstruction arrangements or other matters, they can make their complaints to the relevant \ndepartment. The process and results of grievance redress will be recorded, monitored, and \nevaluated by the relevant IAs. If necessary, further follow-up measures will be taken to ensure \nthat the problems will be resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. \n \n13.  The requirements for internal and external monitoring and evaluation are included in the \nresettlement framework. The internal monitoring is to (i) maintain supervision of resettlement \nimplementation, (ii) check that the project can be constructed smoothly, and (iii) ensure the APs\u2019 \nentitlements are provided as per regulations and in a timely manner. The EAs will engage a \nqualified domestic monitor to carry out independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation. The \nmonitor will conduct investigations during resettlement and prepare annual monitoring reports \nuntil the completion of the Project. The first monitoring and evaluation report will be due 31 \nDecember 2009. \n ", "Appendix 15  59\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) report aims to describe the project rural road \nand bridge and school components, assess their environmental impacts, and provide mitigation \nmeasures for the environmental impacts. This report summarizes 23 IEEs prepared by project \ncounties as part of the domestic environmental impact assessment procedure. The IEEs were \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Disaster  and  Emergency \nAssistance Policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and will be approved by provincial \nenvironmental  protection  departments  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Law (2002) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and its related regulations.  \n \n2.  The  Emergency  Assistance  for  Wenchuan  Earthquake  Reconstruction  Project  is \ncategorized  as  environment  category  B.  Given  the  nature  of  the  physical  works  (i.e., \nreconstruction of damaged roads and bridges and school buildings), the potential negative \nimpacts are localized and short-term, and can be mitigated. Therefore, an environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) is not required.  \n \n3.  Because of the Project\u2019s emergency assistance nature, a few IEEs of project rural roads \nhave not yet been finalized. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has \nbeen prepared for those rural road components to be selected during project implementation. \nThe relevant county communication bureau will carry out an environmental assessment in \naccordance with the PRC\u2019s environmental assessment laws and regulations, and will prepare \nan IEE.2 If the EARF determines that a full EIA is required for a new road section, the county \ncommunication bureau will prepare an EIA report, and ADB will finance the road section after its \nEIA  report  concurrence.  The  environmental  impact  of  school  building  reconstruction  is \ninsignificant if the school buildings are reconstructed in the original school yard and the adjacent \nresidential area, and therefore the need for a full EIA is unlikely for that component. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n4.  The Project\u2019s physical component consists of reconstruction of damaged roads and \nschool buildings in 23 counties in Sichuan (19 counties) and Shaanxi (four counties) provinces. \nThe technical standard of the rural roads is classes II\u2013IV. The road reconstruction will be carried \nout strictly in the existing right-of-way, except for bridge reconstruction. Some roads include \ndamaged bridge reconstruction. The school buildings will be reconstructed in the existing school \nyards and adjacent lots. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Meteorology \n \n5.  The project area is located in the mid-west of the PRC in four separate mountainous \nareas: in the north of Sichuan Basin (Guangyuan, Bazhong, and Nanchong prefectures), in the \nwest  of  Sichuan  Basin  (Chengdu  and  Yaan  prefectures),  in  the  west  of  Hanzhong  Basin \n(Hanzhong prefecture), and in the west of Guangzhong Plain (Baoji prefecture). The Qinghai\u2013\nTibet Plateau has a continental monsoon climate in winter, when it is influenced by cold, dry air \nfrom  the  northwest.  In  summer,  the  oceanic  monsoon  brings  warm  and  humid  air  from \nsoutheast and southwest; it is wet, often with heavy rains and storms. The annual average \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n2  If a new section\u2019s environmental impacts are significant, a full environmental impact assessment will be carried out \naccording to EARF. \n ", "60  Appendix 15 \nrainfall is 1,000\u20132,000 millimeters, 80%\u201390% of which falls from May to October. The intense \nprecipitation between May and October was a concern after the earthquake, as heavy storms \nincrease the risk of siltation, erosion, slope slippage, and mudflows.  \n \n2.  Protected Areas \n \n6.  There are 12 nature reserves in Sichuan\u2019s project counties3 and one nature reserve in \nShaanxi\u2019s project counties.4 None of the Project\u2019s rural roads are located near the nature \nreserve boundaries; the distance between the roads and boundaries is at least 8 km. \n \n3.  Land Use and Cultural Resources \n \n7.  Most land use around the roads is nonagricultural, including secondary forests, steep \nmountain terrain, and some marginal grazing land. Cultivated land includes land containing \nvegetables, corn, wheat, buckwheat, orchards, and paddy lands. School reconstruction sites are \nlocated in residential area or urban business districts.  \n \n8.  The project area has a long history dating from the Neolithic period. Therefore, the \npossibility of encountering unknown cultural relics during civil works exists.  \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangement \n \n9.  The  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  and  the  communication \ndepartments of Hanzhong and Baoji cities are responsible for overall environmental protection \nduring rural road reconstruction. The provincial highway bureaus are responsible for supervising \nthe  rural  road  reconstruction-related  activities  of  the  county  communications  bureaus.  The \ncounty  communications  bureaus  have  prepared  environmental  impact  registration  tables \n(EIRTs) or environmental impact assessment reports (EIARs) by hiring accredited consultants, \nin  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Law.  IEEs  have  been \nprepared on the basis of the EIRTs and EIARs, and include an environmental management plan \n(EMP). Civil works will be carried out by the civil works contractors. The technical specifications \nof the contracts will (i) include environmental protection measures described in the EMPs, and \ntheir cost; and (ii) will ensure that all environmental protection measures will be carried out by \nthe civil works contractors. The project implementation agencies (IAs) will supervise the civil \nworks by hiring construction supervision consultants.  \n \n10.  The  Hanzhong  and  Baoji  city  education  departments  are  responsible  for  overall \nenvironmental  protection  of  school  building  reconstruction.  They  will  supervise  the  school \nbuilding reconstruction activities of county education bureaus, which have prepared EIRTs for \nschool  reconstruction.  The  county  education  bureaus  will  hire  consulting  firms  for  school \nbuilding design, which will be carried out in accordance with the PRC\u2019s building codes and \nregulations for environmental protection, such as regulations on sewage treatment. The contract \ntechnical specifications for building construction will include environmental protection measures, \nand the contracts will include the environmental protection cost. County education bureaus will \nsupervise the construction works by hiring construction supervision consultants. \n \n                                                 \n3  Heshuihe Nature Reserve in Dayi County, Cuiyunlanggubai Nature Reserve Yuanba District, Suimagou Nature \nReserve in Chaotian District, Micangshan Nature Reserve in Wangcang County, Tiancaibanzhulin Nature Reserve \nin Cangxi County, Gouxihe Nature Reserve in Liangzhong City, Lizhuping Nature Reserve in Shimian County, \nFengtongzhai Nature Reserve in Baoxing County, Baoxinghe Nature Reserve in Baoxing County, Noshuihe Nature \nReserve in Tongjiang County, Guangwushan Nature Reserve in Nanjiang County, and Dashaolangou Nature \nReserve in Nanjiang County. \n4  Baofeng Nature Reserve in Lueyang County. \n ", "Appendix 15  61\nE.  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework \n \n11.  When new rural road and bridge or new school building reconstruction is planned, an \ninitial environmental screening will determine the need for a full EIA report under the PRC\u2019s \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Law and the EARF. The county communications bureaus will \ncarry out environmental screening for each road and bridge reconstruction under the supervision \nof the provincial highway bureau; the county education bureau will carry out environmental \nscreening  for  school  reconstruction  under  the  supervision  of  city  education  bureau.  If  the \nscreening identifies any potential significant environmental impacts related to reconstruction, a \nfull EIA report for the component will be prepared and approved before the reconstruction works \nbegin. For road and bridge reconstruction without significant environmental impacts, an EIRT will \nbe  prepared  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s  regulations.  Potential  environmental  impacts  can  be \nconsidered significant and full a EIA is required if one of the following four conditions applies:  \n \n(i)  any endangered species are found in the environmental impact area (requires a \nfull EIA for the species and its ecosystem);  \n(ii)  any  protected  area,  such  as  a  nature  or  water  reserve,  exists  in  the \nenvironmental impact area (requires an EIA for the reserves); \n(iii)  large-scale earthworks are required near rivers meeting class I or II water quality \nstandards; or  \n(iv)  large-scale  earthworks  are  required  near  any  other  sensitive  sites,  such  as \nhospitals, schools, or residential areas.  \n \nF.  Potential Environmental Impacts and their Mitigation Measures \n \n12.  Rural road and bridge reconstruction activities mainly include debris removal on the \ndamaged sections, damaged pavement removal, embankment restoration, new retaining wall \ninstallation, new slope protection installation, subgrade restoration, drainage installation, and \npavement. Most works will be carried out by hand. Use of large construction machines such as \npower shovels and dump tracks will be limited due to the nature of the rural roads. The major \npotential adverse environmental impacts from road reconstruction are (i) water pollution, (ii) \nnoise to sensitive receptors, and (iii) air pollution from construction machines.  \n \n13.  Water pollution will be avoided by (i) adequate installation of temporary drainage during \nconstruction, (ii) proper maintenance of construction machines and equipment to prevent oil \nleaks, and (iii) installation of sediment ponds at water discharge points. Noise to sensitive \nreceptors  will  be  alleviated  by  (i)  the  use  of  low-noise  machinery,  and  (ii)  appropriate \nconstruction scheduling. The adverse impacts of air pollution from construction machinery will \nbe avoided through adequate maintenance.  \n \n14.  During the road reconstruction, there is a potential risk of encountering unknown cultural \nrelics. If cultural relics are unearthed, according to the PRC\u2019s laws and regulations, the civil \nworks will be immediately suspended and will be resumed only after authorized specialists from \nthe Cultural Bureau have undertaken an archaeological investigation.  \n \n15.  Following completion of construction, the roads will be mainly used by the villagers living \nalong  them,  making  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  road  traffic  unlikely. \nImproved slope protection and drainage systems will reduce soil erosion along the roads, which \nhas been a serious environmental issue after the earthquake.  \n \n16.  School building reconstruction will follow normal building construction techniques. The \nuse of large construction machines will be very limited. Some relatively large buildings (three \nstories or higher) may require cranes. The major potential adverse environmental impacts of \n ", "62  Appendix 15 \nschool building construction are pollution of water as a result of construction activities, and \ndisruption of school activities due to noise.  \n \n17.  Pollution of water as a result of construction site activities will be avoided by the use of \nan adequate sewage system during construction. If the existing sewage system is insufficient or \ninadequate to treat the increased amount of polluted water during construction, a temporary \nwater treatment system will be installed.  \n \n18.  The nature of school building reconstruction work means that general annoyances such \nas noise associated with construction works may be inevitable. However, the disturbance to \nschool activities will be minimized through coordination between the construction and school \nmanagement. The contractors will plan their detailed construction activity by consulting with the \nschool management to allow educational activities to be carried out without serious disruption. \nThe  construction  contract  documents  will  include  provisions  relating  to  consultations  and \nplanning of construction activities.  \n \nG.  Environmental Monitoring \n \n19.  During  the  construction,  compliance  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  county \ncommunication  bureaus  and  education  bureaus.  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment  will  hire  environmental  supervision  consultants  as  part  of  the  construction \nsupervision  to  carry  out  environmental  monitoring  during  the  construction.  In  Shaanxi,  the \ngovernments of Baoji City and Hanzhong City will hire environmental supervision consultants. \nThe consultants will visit construction sites and monitor general construction quality in terms of \nenvironmental protection. The consultants will submit semiannual environmental reports to the \nEA, which will be forwarded to ADB.  \n \nH.  Public Consultations \n \n20.  The county communications bureaus and education bureaus have carried out public \nconsultations during the planning of road and school building reconstruction. The EIRTs and \nEIARs have been made accessible to concerned people in the county government offices.  \n \nI.  Conclusions \n \n21.  The Project\u2019s physical components are reconstruction of damaged roads, bridges and \nschools. Only minor and short-term potential adverse environmental impacts are anticipated, \nprovided that the PRC\u2019s laws and regulations are observed, IEEs are prepared, and the EMPs \ncontained in the IEEs are carried out. The impacts are considered to be controllable through \nproper  implementation  and  supervision  arrangements.  The  major  environmental  protection-\nrelated risk is through inadequate civil works management. This will be avoided by including \nenvironmental  protection  measures  in  contract  documents,  and  by  supervising  the \nimplementation of civil works through the use of construction supervision consultants.   \n \n22.  In summary, the IEEs for the Project show that no significant adverse environmental \nimpacts are expected to result from the proposed reconstruction works. Consequently, no EIA is \nrequired at this stage. In the unlikely event that a specific component is rated as category A, a \nfull EIA for that particular component will be undertaken.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090212093850+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: prc 42496, adb loan agreements, wenchuan earthquake restoration, wenchuan earthquake reconstruction projects, adb project 42496", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090223141330+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan-People's Republic of China: Emergency Assistance for Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction Project"}}
