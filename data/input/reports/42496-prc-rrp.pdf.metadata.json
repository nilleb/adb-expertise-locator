A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  was \nundertaken (Appendix 15). \n \nThe  Project  comprises  two  components:  (i) reconstruction  and \nupgrading of damaged roads and bridges in Sichuan and Shaanxi \nprovinces,  and  (ii)  reconstruction  and  improvements  of  damaged \nschools  in  Shaanxi  Province.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and \nreconstruct  368  high-priority  earthquake  damaged  roads  in  the \nnineteen  worst-affected  counties  of  Sichuan  Province  and  10 \nfour  worst-affected  counties  of  Shaanxi \nsubprojects \nProvince.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  12  high-\npriority  earthquake-damaged  education  facilities  in  the  three \nworst-affected  counties  in  Shaanxi  Province.  These  components \nare  designed  to  be  mutually  supporting  in  achieving  the  overall \nobjective  of  restoring \nto \ninfrastructure  to  pre-earthquake  levels,  and  ensuring  restored \ninfrastructure is in strict compliance with the latest seismic code. \n \nBased on the Government\u2019s damage and needs assessment and \nthe request of the PRC Government, the Project identifies specific \nsectors  requiring  emergency  assistance  in  two  of  the  worst \nearthquake-affected  provinces  (Sichuan  and  Shaanxi).  The \nProject  seeks  to  (i)  build  on  the  immediate  relief  provided  by  the \nGovernment  in  the  earthquake-affected  provinces;  (ii)  contribute \nto  coordinated  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  by  different \ndevelopment  partners  and  the  Government;  and  (iii) specifically \naddress  sustainable  recovery  priorities  by  providing  indirect \nlivelihood  support  through  public  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction, which generates public employment and underpins \nthe  restoration  of  livelihood  activities  by  rehabilitating  roads, \nbridges,  and  schools.  The  project  design  draws  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  experience  in  delivering  emergency \nassistance  acquired  in  different  developing  member  countries \nover  the  past  two  decades,  and  complements  relief  and  other \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  assistance  provided  by  the \nGovernment,  United  Nations \nnongovernment \norganizations,  bilateral  development  partners,  and  the  World \nBank. \n\nthe  affected  communities\u2019  access \n\nagencies, \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification  \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementing Agencies \n\nthe  Project \n\nBy  meeting  the  earthquake  reconstruction  needs  of  the  next  3 \nyears, \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004).  The  Project  supports  The \nState  Overall  Plan  for  Post-Wenchuan  Earthquake  Restoration \nthe  Government  on  19 \nand  Reconstruction  approved  by \nSeptember 2008.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  accelerated  restoration  of  education \nand  transport  infrastructure  in  earthquake-affected  areas  of \nSichuan  and  Shaanxi  provinces.  The  Project  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  (i)  restore  the  livelihoods  and  economic \nactivities  of \nthe  affected  population;  (ii)  accelerate  poverty \nalleviation  in  the  earthquake-affected  counties,  many  of  which \nhave  a  high  incidence  of  poverty;  and  (iii) rehabilitate  and \nreconstruct  public  and  community-based  infrastructure  that  is \nvulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is \ntransport  and  education \nrestoration  of  people\u2019s  access \ninfrastructure  to  pre-earthquake  levels  in  19  counties  of  Sichuan \nand four counties of Shaanxi provinces. \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $441.6 million equivalent.  \n \nA  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a grace period of 8 years \nwith a maturity period of 32 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\nlending \n\nto \n\n \nAs  the  Project  is  for  emergency  assistance,  implementation  will \nstart  immediately  after  approval  and  be  completed  within  36 \nmonths. \n \nSichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department \nin  Sichuan \nProvince;  and  Hanzhong  city  government  and  Baoji  city \ngovernment in Shaanxi Province \n \nSichuan Highway Administration Bureau in Sichuan Province; and \nfor  roads  and \ncounty-level  highway  administration  bureaus \nbridges,  and  county-level  education  bureaus  for  schools  in \nShaanxi Province. \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nto \n\nfor  providing \n\nProcurement  of  goods,  services,  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as \namended from time to time) and the contemplated implementation \nschedule.  ADB\u2019s  procedure \nreconstruction \nassistance  after  disasters  allows  for  flexibility  so  that  project \nactivities  can  start  promptly.  National  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be the preferred procurement mode. \n \ntotal  of  1,698  person-months  of  national  construction \nA \nsupervision  consultant  services  will  be  used  to  monitor  project \nimplementation  of  civil  works,  environmental  protection, \nresettlement, and project performance.  \n \nThe  Project  will  bring  benefits \nthe  project  area  by \n(i) reconstructing  and  improving  road  conditions  and  accessibility \nin  townships  and  villages  in  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provinces, \n(ii) reconstructing and improving 12 schools in Shaanxi Province, \nand  (iii) creating  local  employment  opportunities  from  project \nconstruction  and  related  activities.  The  Project  will  provide  equal \nbenefits to females and males. \n \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  rural  roads  and  bridges  include \n(i) savings in vehicle operating costs as a result of improved traffic \nand  road  conditions,  (ii)  time  savings  for  rural  road  users, \n(iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents, \nand \ntraffic.  The \nreconstruction  and  upgrading  of  rural  roads  in  Sichuan  and \nShaanxi  provinces  will  benefit  about  5.6  million  people,  three-\nquarters  of  whom  are  rural  and  one-third  of  whom  are  poor.  As \nreliable  transport  to  markets  becomes  more  readily  available, \ncash  crop  farming  in  remote  or  isolated  areas  will  be  stimulated \nand  access \nto  off-farm  employment  opportunities  will  be \nbroadened. \n \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  reconstruction  of  and  improvements  to \n12  model  schools  to  appropriate  design  standards,  including  six \njunior  secondary  and  six  primary  schools.  This  will  bring \nimmediate  benefits  to  the  schools\u2019  16,600  students  (including \nmore  than  8,000  female  students),  and  long-term  benefits  to \nfuture  students  drawn  from  the  460,000  residents  of  the  areas \nserviced by the schools, about 40% of whom are from rural areas \nof remote counties. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  rebuild \ninfrastructure  and  utilities, \nthe  economy,  rehabilitate  public \nreinstate  seismic  code  compliance,  and  generate  employment. \nThe  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  schools  will \nenable education services to be restored, and will offer long-term \nbenefits  for  affected  persons  by  supporting  opportunities  for \nemployment and participation in economic activities. \n \n\n(iv) economic  benefits \n\nfrom  generated \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nto \n\nImplementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of \nquality  subprojects  in  the  two  sectors  will  be  mitigated  in  several \nways.  Specific  monitoring  mechanisms \nsupervise \nimplementation  will  include  regular  design  and  construction \nsupervision  as  well  as  financial  audits.  To  undertake  such \nthe  executing  agencies  will  be  supported  by \nsupervision, \ndedicated  project  monitoring  offices  and  consulting \ninputs. \nAnother  potential  risk  could  be  the  lack  of  experience  of  the \nimplementing  agencies  with  ADB  procedures.  This  will  be \nmitigated  through  tailored  training  for  the  implementing  agencies \non  ADB  procedures  immediately  after  the  Project  becomes \neffective. ADB will provide continuous support and supervision of \nproject  implementation  to  the  implementing  agencies,  including \nconducting special review missions, if required. \n \nThe  Government  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant \nfor  Wenchuan  earthquake \nsupport \nreconstruction. The TA grant support will have three components. \nTA grant support for project implementation will provide capacity-\nbuilding assistance to the executing and implementing agencies to \nenable  speedy  and  smooth  implementation,  particularly  with \nrespect  to  procurement,  disbursement,  monitoring,  and  quality \ncontrol.  TA \ninvolve \n(i) establishment  of  two  model  schools,  focusing  on  information \ntechnology  and  on  natural  sciences; \nand  communication \n(ii) development  of  training  materials,  and  provision  of  in-service \ntraining  of  teachers,  including  in  areas  such  as  student-centered \nlearning;  and  (iii)  capacity  building  of  the  teachers  in  the  worst-\naffected  counties.  In  the  transport  sector,  the  TA  will  provide \ncapacity building regarding (i) road construction quality in remote \nand  mountainous  areas,  and  (ii)  sustainable  rural  road  operation \nand maintenance systems. \n\nthe  education  component  will \n\nfor  capacity  building \n\nfor \n\n\fo\n106  00'E\n\nEMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR\nWENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nQ I N G H A I\n\n300 km.\n\n32  00'No\n\n200 km.\n\nG A N S U\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nChencang\n\nXi'an\n\nS H A A N X I\n\nLueyang\n\n6\n\n8\n\n5\n\n7\n\n4\n\n12\n\n9\nNingqiang\n\n10\n\n11\nMianxian\n\nChaotian\n\nWangcang\n\nYuanba\n\nNanjiang\n\n100 km.\n\nWenchuan\n\nYouxian\n\nFucheng\n\nJingyang\nLuojiang\n\nS I C H U A N\n\nSantai\n\nYanting\n\nCangxi\n\nZitong\n\nLangzhong\n\nGuanghang\n\nCHENGDU\n\nDayi\n\nZhongjiang\n\nBaoxing\n\nLushan\n\nShimian\n\nSHANXI\n\nHENAN\n\n32  00'No\n\nH U B E I\n\nChongqing\n\nC H O N G Q I N G\n\nProject County\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCounty\n\nEarthquake Epicenter\n\nCounty Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n28  00'No\n\nG U I Z H O U\n\nProject Schools\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nChengcang Primary School\nChengcang Middle School\nGuozhen No. 1 Middle School\nHeiheba Primary School\nXiantaiba Primary School\nJiuzhongjin Primary School\nYangjiaba Primary School\nLueyang No. 3 Middle School\nMianxian No. 1 Middle School\nMianxian No. 4 Middle School\nMianxian No. 5 Middle School\nMianxian Primary School\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nKilometers\n\no\n106  00'E\n\n08-5084 HR\n\n28  00'No\n\nY U N N A N\n\nY U N N A N\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Wenchuan \nEarthquake  Reconstruction  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical \nassistance \nfor  Wenchuan  Earthquake \nReconstruction  and,  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for \nthe Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nfor  Providing  Capacity  Building  Support \n\n(TA) \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nNatural Disasters in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC has both a very large population (1.3 billion in 2005) and a vast land area. The \ncountry\u2019s  complex  climatic  and  varied  geological  conditions  make  it  prone  to  many  types  of \nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and snowstorms. Mountainous areas \naccount  for  about  70%  of  the  land  area,  and  the  nature  of  the  PRC\u2019s  mountains,  rivers,  and \nvalleys  give  rise  to  many  geological  and  hydro-meteorological  hazards,  including  frequent \nlandslides,  mudslides,  and  other  geological  hazards.  The  PRC  is  often  affected  by  storm \nsurges, cross-border biological hazards, forest and grassland fire hazards, and other significant \nhazards  such  as  drought.  PRC  has  a  history  of  serious  natural  disasters  of  various  types; \ndisasters  occur  with  high  frequency  over  a  wide  geographical  area,  and  often  result  in \nsignificant, widespread damage in densely populated areas. \n \nThe  PRC  has  suffered  more  than  50  earthquakes  of  magnitude  71 or  greater  over  the \n3. \nlast 50 years. Four of these exceeded magnitude 8. More specifically, Sichuan Province itself is \nparticularly  prone  to  hazardous  earthquakes.  Records  showed  that  six  major  earthquakes \nmeasuring magnitude 6.7\u20137.9 occurred in Sichuan Province between 1933 and 1989. \n \nB. \n \nThe massive earthquake\u2014measuring magnitude 8.0\u2014struck the southwest area of the \n4. \nPRC on 12 May 2008. The epicenter was in Wenchuan County, 92 kilometers (km) northwest of \nthe  Sichuan  provincial  capital  of  Chengdu.  The  earthquake  affected  a  vast  area,  including  10 \nprovinces  (Sichuan,  Shaanxi,  Gansu,  Chongqing,  Yunnan,  Hubei,  Guizhou,  Henan,  Shanxi, \nHunan); 417 counties (cities and districts); 4,667 towns; and 48,810 villages. The total disaster \narea  covered  500,000  square  kilometers  (km2),  in  which  the  51  worst-affected  counties  (cities \nand districts) in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces covered 130,000 km2. The Wenchuan \nearthquake  had  a  high  intensity  with  a  large  number  of  aftershocks.  According  to  China's \nSeismic Network, 33,000 aftershocks were monitored in the main earthquake area between 12 \nMay and 21 October 2008, including over 600 aftershocks measuring magnitude 4.0 and above, \n60 aftershocks measuring magnitude 5.0 and above, and seven measuring magnitude 6.0\u20136.9.  \n \nThe  earthquake-affected  areas  in  Sichuan,  Shaanxi,  and  Gansu  provinces  are  mainly \n5. \nmountainous  and  hilly,  and  the  altitude  across  most  of  the  area  is  high.  These  conditions \n\nEarthquake in Wenchuan (Sichuan Province) \n\n                                                 \n1  Earthquake magnitude is a quantitative measure of the wave amplitude an earthquake generates, and hence is a \nmeasure of its size. An increase of 1.0 in magnitude results in a 10-fold increase in the waveform amplitude and \nabout a 31-fold increase in the energy released. Earthquake intensity is a qualitative measure of the actual shaking \nat a location during an earthquake, and is typically based on three features: (i) perception by people and animals, \n(ii) performance of buildings, and (iii) changes to natural surroundings.  \n\n \n\n\fThe Government\u2019s Response \n\ncaused secondary disasters, such as landslides, collapse and mud-rock flows. For example, the \nearthquake resulted in many large-scale barrier lakes, which for a time threatened thousands of \npeople  living  at  lower  elevations  in  Mianyang  county  in  Sichuan  Province.  The  secondary \ngeological disaster caused by the earthquake had a widespread, profound and sustained impact \non  the  earthquake  disaster-affected  region.  The  disaster-affected  region  includes  both \neconomically less-developed and impoverished regions and also more advanced regions, such \nas the high-tech industrial zones of Chengdu, Deyang, and Mianyang.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  State  Council  set  up  an  earthquake  disaster  relief  headquarters  as  soon  as  the \nWenchuan earthquake was reported. The premier assumed the post of commander-in-chief and \npersonally  directed  the  disaster  response  and  relief  through  nine  working  teams.  Under  the \nguidance  of  the  State  Council,  different  government  agencies  worked  with  the  local \ngovernments  to  provide  relief  in  disaster-affected  areas.  CNY27.5  billion  was  allocated  for \ndisaster relief by the central Government, and this was supplemented by assistance provided by \nprovincial and local governments.  \n \n7. \nFinancial  assistance  included  a  solatium  of  CNY5,000,  which  was  provided  for  each \ndeceased  person;  a  subsidy  of  CNY28,000,  provided  for  the  seriously  injured;  and  a  special \nrelief  subsidy  of  CNY600  per  month,  which  is  being  provided  for  orphans,  the  elderly,  and \nhandicapped  people.  The  Government  provided  a  subsidy  of  CNY10,000  to  farmers  whose \nhouses  were  severely  damaged,  which  was  supplemented  by  the  local  government.  The \nGovernment  also  established  a  system  of  counterpart  restoration  and  reconstruction  support, \nwith  provinces  helping  heavily  affected  counties\u2014each  province  provided  1%  of  their  revenue \nover  the  last  financial  year  to  support  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  in  a  heavily  affected \ncounty.  \n \nFor  the  first  time,  the  Government  requested  support  from  the  local  and  international \n8. \ncommunity,  and  donations  totaled  CNY59.5  billion.  The  international  community  responded \nquickly after the Wenchuan earthquake, and provided emergency assistance and support to the \nPRC for the initial rescue efforts. The assistance from the international community was mainly \nfocused  on  providing  funds  and  relief  supplies,  sending  rescue  and  medical  teams,  and \nproviding technical support.  \n \n9. \nThe three severely affected provinces (Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu) responded quickly \nto  the  disaster,  and  took  effective  measures  to  save  affected  persons  (APs).  The  three \nprovincial governments launched a multi-level (provincial, city, and county) contingency plan to \nfacilitate rapid and effective rescue and relief activities in the affected areas. Local governments \norganized  search  and  rescue  teams  to  rescue  the  people  trapped  in  the  collapsed  structures \nand  isolated,  remote  mountainous  areas  (in  Sichuan  alone  84,017  people  were  rescued  from \ncollapsed structures and 1.49 million were rescued from isolated mountainous areas and then \nrelocated); medical teams and ambulances were organized to rescue the wounded; medicines, \nfood  supplies,  milk  powder,  drinking  water,  tents,  clothing,  quilts,  and  other  urgently  needed \nsupplies  were  delivered  to  the  affected  areas;  quick  action  was  taken  to  restore  critical \ninfrastructure such as water and power supplies, roads, bridges and telecommunications; urgent \nmeasures  were  taken  to  reduce  risks  from  the  dangerous  reservoirs  that  had  formed;  and \nrelocated people were provided with tents, food, drinking water, clothes, and other basic needs, \nand arrangements were made to treat people with post-disaster psychological distress.  \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fDamage and Needs Assessment \n\nD. \n \n10. \nAfter  the  earthquake,  the  Government  issued  a  regulation  on  8  June  2008  on  post-\nWenchuan earthquake disaster recovery and reconstruction and formed a working team headed \nby the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to conduct damage and needs \nassessments for infrastructure restoration and post-disaster reconstruction. Local and provincial \ngovernments collected damage data from counties, prefectures, and provinces, which was then \nconsolidated  by  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Affairs  (MCA).  NDRC  worked  with  the  line  ministries  to \nprepare an overall reconstruction plan, which was made available via the internet for comments \nfrom the general public and other stakeholders. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment  partners  were  also  invited  to  provide  comments  on  the  plan.  The  Government's \noverall reconstruction plan (Supplementary Appendix A) was approved by the State Council on \n19 September 2008.  \n \n11. \nIn addition, the Government requested that ADB provide  TA to support the emergency \nresponse to the Wenchuan earthquake.2 The TA included a component to conduct a preliminary \nassessment of the damage and needs of the social and physical infrastructure, drawing from the \nGovernment\u2019s own assessment, and draw up a prioritized list of ADB programs and projects to \nassist  reconstruction  and  recovery  within  the  affected  region.  ADB  consultants  worked  closely \nwith  the  MCA  and  conducted  an  assessment  of  the  impacts  on  social  and  infrastructure \nsectors\u2014including  urban  and  rural  housing,  public  facilities,  infrastructure,  agriculture  and \necology, industry, and public and commercial services\u2014using relevant assessment criteria and \nstandards. The summary of the damage and needs assessment is in Appendix 2. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  TA,  ADB  fielded  a  reconnaissance  mission  on  11\u201315  October  2008 \n12. \nand a fact-finding mission on 19\u201327 November 2008 to Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces to get \nfirst-hand  knowledge  for  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs  assessment,  assess  the  scale  of \ndamage caused by the earthquake, and meet with different stakeholders. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nThe  Wenchuan  earthquake  caused  extensive  damage  and  heavy  losses,  mainly  in \nSichuan,  Shaanxi,  and  Gansu  provinces;  and  caused  some  damage  in  another  seven \nprovinces. The impacts of the earthquake were devastating\u2014as of 25 September 2008,   of the \n46.25  million  affected  people,  69,227  were  dead,  374,643  were  injured,  17,923  were  missing, \nand  1.5  million  people  had  been  evacuated.  About  8  million  homes  were  destroyed  and  24.5 \nmillion  damaged,  and  17,951  educational  institutions  were  destroyed  or  damaged.  Transport, \ninfrastructure,  power  supply,  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  critical  infrastructure  such  as \nhospitals  and  clinics  and  lifeline  facilities,  and  communications  were  destroyed  or  badly \ndamaged throughout the affected region. A large number of rural and urban houses collapsed, \ninfrastructure facilities were damaged on a large scale, agriculture and industry suffered heavy \nlosses,  and there  was  severe  environmental  destruction. The  earthquake  caused  high  altitude \nlandslides, rock falls, and debris flows, and formed barrier lakes. The total direct economic loss \ncaused  by  the  Wenchuan  earthquake  is  estimated  at  CNY852,309  million;  losses  in  Sichuan, \nShaanxi, and Gansu provinces are estimated at CNY845,136 million (99.16% of the total).  \n \n14. \nThe disaster\u2019s financial impact represents 3.3% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \nfor the 2007 fiscal year, and obviously impacts the country\u2019s economy. The earthquake was the \n\nImpact of the Earthquake \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Providing Emergency Response to Sichuan \n\nEarthquake. Manila (TA 7081-PRC). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nsecond  significant  disaster  to  hit  the  PRC  in  2008  (after  the  snow  disaster  in  the  southern \nprovinces).  In  addition,  indirect  losses  from  the  Wenchuan  earthquake  could  be  much  higher \nthan estimated above, due to the nature and scale of the damage and loss incurred. \n \n\n1. \n\nEstimated Damages and Reconstruction Costs \n\n \n15. \nLosses  totalled  CNY771.8  billion  in  Sichuan,  CNY50.5  billion  in  Gansu,  and  CNY22.8 \nbillion in Shaanxi province, with Sichuan accounting for 91.32% of the total. Losses in the three \nprovinces\u2019  social  sectors  equalled  CNY465.3  billion  (55.05%  of  total  losses),  and  in \ninfrastructure CNY188.1 billion (22.26%).  \n \n16. \nThe  total  reconstruction  cost  for  the  51  more  severely  affected  counties  (cities  and \ndistricts) in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces is estimated at around CNY1 trillion.3 The \nCentral  Post-quake  Restoration  and  Reconstruction  Fund  established  by  the  Government  is \nexpected  to  cover  30%  of  the  total  reconstruction  cost.  Nineteen  provinces  have  set  up \npartnerships  with  24  counties  in  Sichuan,  Shaanxi,  and  Gansu  to  provide  in-kind  assistance \nover a 3-year period to their counterparts, equal to not less than 1% of their budgetary financial \nrevenues during 2007.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImpacts on Transport and Education Sectors \n\n \n17. \nTransportation. Transportation infrastructure, which consists mainly of road and railway \nsystems, suffered losses of CNY87.39 billion, including CNY66.69 billion in road and CNY20.70 \nbillion in railway systems. An estimated 7,073 roads (40,012 km), 4,989 road bridges, and 158 \nroad tunnels were damaged. Most damage was in Sichuan Province. The Chengdu\u2013Mianyang \nhighway,  Mianyang\u2013Guangyuan  highway,  Ya\u2019an\u2013Shimian  highway  and  most  of \nthe \nnational/provincial  roads  within  Aba  Prefecture  were  completely  blocked  as  a  result  of  the \nearthquake.  The  damaged  railway  system  included  4,026  km  of  railway  lines,  377  railway \ntunnels, 1,280.9 km of power lines, 83 items of electrical equipment, and 52 locomotives. Some \nmajor  railway  stations  such  as  Mianyang,  Guangyuan,  Jiangyou,  and  Deyang  were  seriously \ndamaged. \n \nTransportation  losses  totaled  CNY74.79  billion  in  Sichuan  Province,  CNY7.23  billion  in \n18. \nGansu  Province,  and  CNY5.37  billion  in  Shaanxi  Province.  Road  systems  losses  equaled \nCNY58.33 billion in Sichuan, CNY7.07 billion in Gansu, and CNY1.29 billion in Shaanxi. Losses \nin  the  railway  systems  totaled  CNY16.46  billion  in  Sichuan,  CNY162  million  in  Gansu,  and \nCNY4.08  billion  in  Shaanxi.  The  transport  sector  assessment  and  proposed  assistance  is  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n19. \nEducation.  The  earthquake  had  a  devastating  impact  on  the  delivery  of  all  social \nservices in the affected areas. In addition to destruction or serious damage to physical facilities, \nmany  care  providers  (including  teachers  and  other  school  staff)  suffered  death  or  serious \ninjuries. Educational institutions at all levels\u2014from primary schools to degree colleges\u2014suffered \nsubstantial  damage,  with  a  total  of  17,951  fully  or  partially  damaged  educational  institutions, \nincluding 12,253 in Sichuan Province, 5,455 in Shaanxi Province, and 243 in Gansu Province. \nThe  counties  with  the  most  fully  destroyed  basic  schools  are  Mao  (153),  Pingwu  (137), \nWenchuan  (129),  and  Beichuan  (83).  Losses  of  education  sector  are  estimated  at  CNY4,676 \nmillion.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3  As estimated by the overall reconstruction plan, approved by the State Council on 19 September 2008.  \n\n\fResponse of Development Partners \n\nBefore the earthquake (at the end of 2007), Shaanxi Province had 18,953 primary and \n20. \nsecondary education facilities, which were adequate for its population of around 37 million, and \nprovided  coverage  to  the  province\u2019s  urban  and  rural  population.  The  earthquake  affected  40 \ncounties in Shaanxi province, and four\u2014Chenchang, Lueyang, Mian Xian, and Ningqing\u2014were \nparticularly hard hit; about 25% of all schools in Shaanxi (5,455 schools) were damaged. A large \nnumber of schools are at risk of collapsing as a result of the significant damage they sustained. \nThe  affected  schools  occupy  3.65  million  square  meters  (m2)  and  the  economic  losses  in \nShaanxi's education sector constitute CNY2.2 billion. The cost of reconstructing lost assets and \nrestoring  education  services  is  estimated  to  be  CNY5.7  billion.  The  education  reconstruction \nneeds  are  enormous  and  will  take  a  substantial  amount  of  time.  The  Government  is  already \nfinancing  the  reconstruction  of  117  schools  that  will  occupy  0.84  million  m2  and  will  cost \nCNY1.65 billion. The social sector assessment and proposed assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \nF. \n \n21. \nThe  international  community  responded  quickly  after  the  Wenchuan  earthquake,  and  a \ntotal  of  171  countries  and  over  20  international  organizations  provided  emergency  assistance \nand support, including funds and relief supplies, to the PRC. The United Nations and relevant \ninternational  organizations  were  very  concerned  about  the  impact  of  the  earthquake,  and  the \nUnited Nations set up a special fund to support the Government\u2019s relief efforts.  \n \n22. \nOn  1  November  2008,  the  State  Council  approved  the  use  of  emergency  assistance \nloans  from  various  international  financial  institutions  for  post-earthquake  reconstruction,  and \n$1.5  billion  in  loans  have  been  requested  by  the  Government  from  the  various  international \nfinancial institutions and bilateral donors. These will be allocated as grants to Sichuan, Shaanxi, \nand Gansu provinces for reconstruction, with the Government responsible for loan repayment.  \n \n23. \nThe  $1.5  billion  in  loans  includes  requests  for  (i)  a  loan  from  the  World  Bank  of  $710 \nmillion,  of  which  $510  million  is  allocated  to  Sichuan  for  reconstruction  of  urban  and  public \nhealth  facilities,  and  $200  million  to  Gansu  for  reconstruction  of  education  facilities;  (ii)  a  loan \nfrom ADB of $400 million, of which $300 million is for Sichuan for rural road reconstruction and \n$100  million  for  Shaanxi  for  reconstruction  of  rural  roads  and  bridges  and  primary  and  middle \nschools;  (iii)  a  loan  from  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  of  $200  million  for  urban \ninfrastructure  reconstruction  and  biogas  facility  restoration  in  Sichuan;  (iv)  a  loan  from \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) of $30 million and a grant of $1.5 million \nfor biogas facilities restoration in Sichuan; and (v) a loan from the European Investment Bank of \n$160 million for ecosystem restoration in Sichuan. \n \nG. \n \nADB\u2019s  strategy  under  its  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy 4  is  to  support \n24. \nnational  and  provincial  governments  and  other  stakeholders  to  overcome  exogenous  shocks \ncaused  by  calamities  to  enable  early  restoration  of  economic  and  social  activity  in  affected \nareas,  especially  by  the  poor.  The  strategy  is  designed  to  ensure  that  emergency  assistance \nprojects  provide  a  bridging  function  to  ameliorate  the  impacts  of  the  disaster  and dovetail  into \nthe  development  process  by  selecting  the  highest  priority  needs  for  emergency  assistance  in \nconsultation  with  the  central  government,  provincial  and  local  governments,  civil  society,  and \nother stakeholders, including other donors.  \n \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy and Response \n\n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nLessons \n\nAfter  receiving  the  request  for  emergency  assistance  from  the  PRC  Government,  ADB \n25. \nimmediately  provided  TA  of  $1  million  to  PRC  for  providing  emergency  response  to  the \nWenchuan earthquake.5 The TA provided support for the Government\u2019s initial rehabilitation and \nrestoration  efforts  in  the  earthquake  disaster-affected  areas.  The  TA  also  provided  the \nopportunity  to  (i)  assist  the  Government  review  the  existing  national  disaster  management \nsystem  framework,  with  specific  reference  to  the  Wenchuan  earthquake;  (ii)  conduct  a \npreliminary  assessment  of  the  damage  and  needs  of  the  social  and  physical  infrastructure, \nbased on the Government\u2019s own assessment; and (iii) prepare a prioritized list of ADB programs \nand  projects  that  will  assist  reconstruction  and  recovery  within  the  affected  region.  ADB \nprovided  three  policy  notes6 to  the  Government  on  (i)  recommendation  for  dealing  with  the \ntransition from disaster response to recovery, (ii) post disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction, \nand  (iii)  key  issues  for  developing  earthquake  insurance  in  the  PRC.  These  notes  highlighted \nkey lessons from international experience and made recommendations for possible adoption by \nthe  Government.  ADB  is  also  providing  TA7 for  promoting  public  and  private  participation  in \ndisaster risk management. \n \nH. \n \n26. \nLessons  in  Disaster  Response.  The  earthquake  impact  issues  that  constrain  the \nrecovery  of  affected  provinces  confirm  the  importance  of  lessons  drawn  from  previous  ADB \nemergency  assistance  and  ADB  policies.  This  is  the  first  emergency  assistance  loan  to  be \nprocessed  for  the  PRC  under  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy. 8 General \nlessons  can  be  drawn  from  past  experience  with  projects  developed  for  other  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) under this policy. The ongoing TA also identifies key lessons, which \nare also taken into consideration. \n \n27. \nA review of ADB-wide experience with emergency rehabilitation assistance indicates the \nfollowing  essential  factors:  (i)  projects  must  be  prepared  as  quickly  as  possible;  (ii)  projects \nshould  focus  on  restoring  facilities;  (iii)  to  the  extent  possible,  rehabilitation  works  should  be \ncompleted within 2\u20133 years; (iv) as implementation places a heavy burden on executing agency \nstaff, strong ADB supervision is needed during implementation; and (v) efforts should be made \nto  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  rapid  response  to  disasters  is  matched  by  equally  quick  government \naction.  Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  earlier  emergency  projects  include  the  following:  (i) beneficiary \nparticipation  must  be  ensured  and  increased  in  project  preparation  and  implementation, \nespecially  in  the  maintenance  of  facilities;  (ii)  environmental  and  social  aspects  should  be \nconsidered during project implementation, even though the need for a rapid response may not \npermit  a  detailed  treatment  of  these  issues  prior  to  the  approval  of  the  assistance; \n\n                                                 \n5  The TA is ongoing (footnote 2). \n6  ADB. 2008.

The Government \nshould ensure reconstructed public and private buildings and infrastructure are protected from \nvarious  types  of  hazards.  A  review  of  Wenchuan  earthquake  experience9 reveals  that  lessons \nfrom the damage should be fed into reconstruction planning, and future risks reduced through \nimproved  building  standards  and  design.  The  safety  of  public  buildings  such  as  schools  is \nparticularly  important,  and  risks  should  be  reduced  through  strict  adherence  to  the  new \nconstruction standards. The primary lesson is that new buildings, including schools, need to be \ndesigned to withstand seismic shocks and built to a higher quality. Future compliance with the \nnew  construction  code  will  require  strong  enforcement.  During  the  reconstruction  phase,  the \nrepair of damaged buildings needs to include seismic strengthening.  \n \nThe lessons and experiences of current relief and recovery coordination should be used \n29. \nto develop an appropriate disaster-management mechanism and authority, as well as a national \nplan  that  clarifies  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  different  government  agencies  and \nstrengthens  coordination  among  them.  Risk  management  education  and  training  of  staff  from \nappropriate  agencies  would  greatly  improve  risk  management  in  the  country.  Primary  and \nsecondary  schools  should  raise  risk  awareness  through  the  curriculum.  Incorporating  risk-\nmitigation safety measures into the basic training of engineers, contractors, and builders should \nalso be considered as part of the reconstruction process. A major public awareness campaign \non risks, preparedness, and vulnerability reduction should be implemented as soon as possible.  \n \n30. \nThese  lessons  have  been  considered  and  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  proposed \nProject.  The  Project  being  designed  has  three  principles:  simplicity,  flexibility,  and  ease  of \nimplementation.  With  an  implementation  period  of  36  months,  the  Project  focuses  on  the \nimmediate rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructure in the affected areas to facilitate the \nrestoration  of  livelihoods.  The  proposed  Project  has  been  prepared  based  on  detailed \ndiscussions with APs and other stakeholders, and visits to the affected project sites. The Project \nwill  complement  assistance  from  government  agencies  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies and donors. \n \nI. \n \n31. \nBased  on  the  Government\u2019s  damage  and  needs  assessment  and  the  request  of  the \nGovernment, the Project identifies specific sectors requiring emergency assistance in two of the \nworst earthquake-affected provinces in the PRC. The Project seeks to (i) build on the immediate \nrelief  provided  by  the  Government  in  the  earthquake-affected  provinces;  (ii)  contribute  to \ncoordinated  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  by  different  development  partners  and  the \nGovernment;  and  (iii) specifically  address  sustainable  recovery  priorities  by  providing  indirect \nlivelihood  support \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  which \ngenerates  public  employment  and  underpins  the  restoration  of  livelihood  activities  by \nrehabilitating  roads,  bridges,  and  schools.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reversing  the \ndevastating impact of the Wenchuan earthquake and to reviving economic activity, and enable \npeople to resume and improve their livelihoods and return to normal life. This will be achieved \n\nthrough  public \n\nRationale \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Providing Emergency Response to Sichuan \n\nEarthquake. Manila (final report).  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nprimarily  by  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  damaged  and  destroyed  infrastructure  as  quickly \nas possible, which will particularly assist the poor and other vulnerable people.  \n \n32. \nThe  project  design  draws  on  ADB  experience  in  delivering  emergency  assistance \nacquired  in  different  DMCs  over  the  past  two  decades,  and  complements  relief  and  other \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  assistance  provided  by  the  Government,  United  Nations \nagencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  bilateral  development  partners,  and  the  World  Bank. \nBy  meeting  the earthquake reconstruction needs of the next 3  years, the Project is consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  The  Project  supports  the  overall \nreconstruction plan approved by the Government on 19 September 2008.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n33. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  the  accelerated  restoration  of  the  education  and  transport \ninfrastructure in the earthquake-affected areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. The Project \nwill  support  efforts  of  the  Government  of  the  PRC  to  (i) restore  the  livelihoods  and  economic \nactivities of the affected population; (ii) accelerate poverty alleviation in the earthquake-affected \ncounties, many of which have a high incidence of poverty; and (iii) rehabilitate and reconstruct \npublic and community-based infrastructure vulnerable to natural disasters. The outcome of the \nProject  is  restoration  of  people\u2019s  access  to  transport  and  education  infrastructure  to  pre-\nearthquake levels in 19 counties of Sichuan Province and four counties of Shaanxi Province.  \n \nB. \n \n34. \nThe Project comprises two components: (i) reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged \nroads and bridges in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and (ii) reconstruction and rehabilitation of \ndamaged  schools  in  Shaanxi  Province.  These  components  are  designed  to  operate  in  a \nmutually  supportive  fashion  to  achieve  the  overall  objective  of  mitigating  earthquake  losses  to \nthe  affected  communities  and  providing  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  priority \neducation and transport infrastructure assets in strict compliance with latest seismic codes. \n \n35. \nTransportation  Component.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  368  high-\npriority earthquake-damaged roads (about 3,500 km in length) in nineteen of the worst-affected \ncounties of Sichuan Province10 and 10 subprojects (about 317 km in length) in four of the worst-\naffected  counties  of  Shaanxi  Province.  Reconstruction  will  provide  improved  seismic  designs, \nand will be undertaken with the adoption of appropriate and cost-effective earthquake-resistant \ndesign and construction standards. A general principle of \u201cbuild back better\u201d will be followed and \nroads will be constructed to a standard that is one level higher than existed previously. \n \n36. \nEducation  Component.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  12  high-priority \nearthquake-damaged education facilities in the three of the worst-affected counties in Shaanxi \nProvince.  Reconstruction  will  adopt  improved  earthquake-resistant  design.  Some  essential \nfurniture and equipment will also be procured for selected reconstructed and repaired schools. \nThe \u201cbuild back better\u201d principle will be followed and rebuilt schools will be of better quality and \ndesign, and include ancillary facilities\u2014e.g., dormitories, dining rooms, reading rooms, and toilet \nfacilities\u2014as part of the new construction. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 These are preliminary estimates and the number of subprojects may be adjusted based on cost considerations. \n\n\fSpecial Features \n\nC. \n \n37. \nincluded in the project design. \n \n\nA  number  of  special  features  have  been  agreed  to  with  the  Government  and  are \n\nADB grant assistance to provincial governments. For the first time, the ADB \nloan  will  be  provided  as  a  grant  by  the  central  Government  to  the  provincial \ngovernments  of  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi.  This  represents  a  departure  from  past \npractice,  thus  enabling  the  provincial  governments  to  utilize  ADB  assistance  for \nnon-revenue generating projects such as rural roads and schools.  \nPeople-centric  approach.  The  earthquake  affected  a  number  of  mostly  poor \nand  vulnerable  people,  and  a  people-centric  approach  to  the  Project  has  been \nadopted, with participatory project preparation. Extensive consultations were held \nwith local villagers, local governments, transport users, school children, teachers, \nand  other  stakeholders.  These  consultations  helped  in  (a)  understanding \nopinions  regarding  the  proposed  Project;  (b)  conducting  the  environmental, \neconomic,  and  social  assessments;  and  (c)  identifying  the  role  of  the  various \nstakeholders. The Project has been prepared to enhance project benefits; ensure \nadverse  impacts  are  avoided  or  mitigated;  and  ensure  economic  development \nbenefits  the  poor,  women,  and  the  vulnerable  in  an  equitable  and  sustainable \nmanner.  Leading  groups  for  implementing  the  Project  have  been  formed  in  the \ncounties,  with  participation  by  relevant  government  agencies,  including  poverty \nreduction offices; the All-China Women's Federation; and health, civil affairs, and \nethnic  affairs  bureaus.  Local  governments  have  provided  assurance  that \nconsultations to implement the Project will continue, particularly regarding social \nand environmental aspects.  \nBuild  back  better.  This  principle  will  be  applied  to  both  components.  The \nintervention  will \ntypically  replace  preexisting  assets,  and  hence  will  be \nreconstructed to the latest appropriate technical, earthquake-resistant standards. \nRural roads will be built to one standard higher (unclassified to class IV, class IV \nto class III, and class III to class II); and ADB-financed schools will benefit from \nconsolidation  and  will  be  developed  as  model  schools  with  three  general \nprinciples:  (a)  making  education  in  these  schools  more  modern  by  adopting \nmodern  teaching  aids,  better  equipped  science  laboratories,  and  establishing \nmultimedia  labs;  (b) making  education  for  children  more  enjoyable  by  providing \nbetter infrastructure and services (dormitories, dining rooms, reading rooms, and \ntoilet facilities); and (c) providing capacity building support to the teachers. \nSimple,  flexible,  and  easy  to  implement.  The  Project  has  been  processed \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  The  procedures  for \nproject  loan  processing,  procurement,  disbursement,  consultant  engagement, \nsubproject  selection,  and  the  type  of  works  to  be  done  reflect  this  flexibility, \nwithout  compromising  on  quality,  transparency,  and  safeguards.  The  Project  is \ndesigned  to  ensure  proper  targeting,  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  and \ncommunity  participation  while  addressing  local  area  resource  and  capacity \nconstraints.  ADB  will  focus  on  ensuring  that  the  project  implementation  is \nefficient, effective, and expedient.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nCooperation  and  collaboration. The Project has been prepared through close \nconsultation with other development partners such as World Bank11 and Agence \nFran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement. 12 The  project  design  and \nimplementation \narrangements  are  aligned  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  with  the  prevailing \nsystem in the PRC to minimize the administrative burden on the Government. \nBuilding  capacity  at  local  level.  Most  ADB  transport  support  has  been  at  the \nprovincial  level.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  at  the  county  level  and  thus \nseeks  to  build  county  capacity.  Because  of  the  Project\u2019s  urgency,  ADB  will \norganize  a  startup  training  workshop  for  each  province  to  help  county  officials \nunderstand ADB\u2019s  project  implementation  requirements  with  respect  to  financial \nmanagement,  procurement  and  disbursement.  Follow-up  assistance  in  the  form \nof  capacity-building  support  to  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  to  facilitate  smooth \nand  speedy  project  implementation  will  be  provided  by  consulting  services \nfinanced  through  the  TA.  Capacity-building  support  will  also  be  provided  to  the \nteachers in the earthquake-affected counties. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nD. \n \n38. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $441.6  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and \nduties,  interest  during  implementation  and  other  charges.

After  the  earthquake,  the  Government  established  a  multi-disciplinary \ncore  group  within  the  State  Council  to  plan  and  coordinate  the  post-earthquake  rehabilitation \nand  reconstruction  program  in  the  affected  provinces.  This  core  group  functions  as  an \ninterdepartmental coordination mechanism for collecting data on damages, losses, rehabilitation \nand reconstruction needs, and outlays for earthquake-affected areas. An overall reconstruction \nplan for Wenchuan earthquake was developed and approved by the State Council as part of the \nrestoration of earthquake damaged infrastructure and services, and a leading group has been \nformed at the national level to monitor the plan\u2019s implementation.  \n\n                                                 \n13 This is in accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (para. 90, footnote 4). \n14 Taxes and duties are less than 5% of the total cost. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nin  Sichuan  province,  and \n\nProject  Level.  The  executing  agencies \n\nProvincial  Level.  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provinces  have  established  leading  groups \n42. \n(headed  by  vice-governors)  to  monitor  timely  implementation  of  the  international  financial \ninstitutions-funded  projects  included  in  the  overall  reconstruction  plan  and  provide  policy \nguidance to the project management offices (PMOs). \n \n(EAs)  will  be  Sichuan  Provincial \n43. \nCommunications  Department \nthe  Hanzhong  and  Baoji  city \ngovernments in Shaanxi province. Each EA will establish a PMO, headed by a project director \nand  supported  by  a  team  specialized  in  project  management,  technical  aspects,  and \nenvironmental and social issues as required. The PMOs will be responsible for (i) providing day-\nto-day  assistance  and  guidance  to  the  project  IAs;  (ii)  consolidating  project  accounts; \n(iii) consolidating  and  submitting  progress  reports  to  ADB;  (iv)  conducting  review  of  financial \nreports provided by the IAs; and (v) reviewing (a) compliance with specifications and plans, and \n(b) quality control by agencies undertaking reconstruction works. \n \n44. \nImplementing Agencies. Sichuan Highway Administration Bureau (SHAB) will act as IA \nfor the roads in Sichuan province. County highway administration bureaus will act as IAs for the \nroads and bridges and county education bureaus as IAs for schools in the respective counties of \nShaanxi  Province.  The  IAs  will  have  PMOs  for  implementing  and  monitoring  the  subprojects. \nDetails of the PMOs are in Appendix 6.  \n \n45. \nThe  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  implementing  reconstruction  works  and  activities; \n(ii) conducting  detailed  assessments,  surveys,  and  planning  of  reconstruction,  including  public \nconsultation and input from recipient local entities and beneficiaries as required; (iii) preparation \nand  implementation  of  short  resettlement  plans,  as  required;  (iv)  prioritizing  works,  and \npreparing  detailed  designs,  specifications,  quantity  schedules,  bidding  documents,  contracts, \nand  related  documentation;  (v)  preparing  regular  progress  reports  for  ADB  through  the \nrespective EAs; and (vi) supervising construction, conducting quality control, approving progress \npayments  to  contractors,  and  maintaining  records  and  accounts  on  an  up-to-date  basis  and \nmaking  these  available  to  ADB,  its  missions,  or  auditors  for  inspection.  The  funds  flow  and \nproject implementation arrangements for Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces are in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria, Approval, and Implementation \n\n \n46. \nThe  list  of  subprojects  for  ADB  support  was  finalized  after  taking  into  account: \n(i) consistency of project readiness and the timing of ADB funding, (ii) whether socioeconomic \nimpacts  are  of  significant  magnitude,  (iii)  whether  a  school  or  road  section  helps  reduce  the \nisolation  of  communities  (subprojects  that  reduce  isolation  will  be  given  priority),  and \n(iv) avoidance of roads or schools that have resettlement and adverse environmental impacts.15 \nAn initial list of subprojects was discussed during the reconnaissance mission, and then revised \nafter taking into account the above criteria during the loan fact-finding mission. However, if any \nsubproject  is  replaced  during  project  implementation,  it  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  and \napproval  by  ADB  before  commencement.  The  procedures  for  selection,  approval,  and \nimplementation of subprojects are in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15 The  local  governments  plan  to  reconstruct  these  roads  using  domestic  funds  because  domestic  procedures  for \n\nland acquisition and environment approvals are much faster. \n\n\fAs  the  Project  is  for  emergency  assistance,  implementation  will  start  immediately  after \n A  detailed  implementation  schedule  is  in \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n47. \napproval  and  be  completed  within  36  months. 16\nAppendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nProcurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n48. \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  contemplated \nimplementation  schedule.  ADB\u2019s  procedure  for  providing  reconstruction  assistance  after \ndisasters  allows  for  flexibility  so  that  project  activities  can  start  promptly.  National  competitive \nbidding  procedures  will  be  the  preferred  mode  of  procurement.  The  local  procurement \nprocedures of the provincial governments are acceptable.  \n \n49. \nGoods and related services estimated at more than $1 million will be procured following \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for \nprocurement of goods and related services estimated at between $100,000 and $1 million. For \nsmall, specialized equipment and materials contracts with a value of less than $100,000, direct \ncontracting  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed.  Due  to  the  nature  of  this  Project,  the  bidding \nperiod  for  international  competitive  bidding  will  be  shortened  to  30  days  and  for  national \ncompetitive bidding to 14 days. \n \n50. \nCivil works contracts over $10 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding  and  those  estimated  to  cost  $10  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  the  national \ncompetitive bidding procedure. Prequalification with single stage, one-envelope procedures for \ncomplex  works,  and  using  the  existing  contractor  registration  system  or  contractors  previously \nprequalified  for  works  of  similar  size  and  nature,  is  acceptable.  Further,  in  order  to  effectively \nrespond to the urgent project needs, contracts estimated at less than $100,000 may be awarded \nto  local  contractors  or  those  contractors  who  are  working  in  the  affected  region  on  a  direct \ncontracting  basis  at  negotiated  rates  or  at  rates  of  ongoing  contracts.  Civil  works  estimated \nbetween $100,000 and $1 million may be awarded following shopping procedures by inviting a \nlimited number of registered or qualified contractors to participate in the bidding, including where \npracticable by advertising the invitation for bids in a national or provincial newspaper. ADB will \nconduct  prior  review  of  bidding  documents,  technical  and  price  evaluation  reports  and  award \nrecommendations for all packages estimated to cost over $10 million. For contracts estimated to \ncost $10 million or less, ADB will review and approve the first contracts for each implementing \nagency;  post-facto  approval  procedures  will  follow  if  procurement  procedures  are  satisfactory. \nHowever,  if  ADB  determines  at  a  later  stage  that  its  guidelines  were  not  followed,  ADB  may \ndeclare  misprocurement  and  not  accept  the  award  or  terms  of  the  contract,  in  which  case  the \nGovernment  will  be  unable  to  use  loan  proceeds  to  finance  the  contract.  If  the  loan  proceeds \nhave  already  been  used  to  finance  such  contracts  at  the  time  of  such  determination,  the \nGovernment will refund to ADB any such expenditure incurred. Rebidding and extending of bid \nvalidity  will  be  subject  to  ADB  prior  approval.  Community  participation  in  the  procurement  of\n\n                                                 \n16 Given  the  number  of  subprojects  in  the  transport  sector  and  their  remote  locations,  a  36-month  implementation \n\nschedule under the ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy is considered appropriate. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nsmall works of a simple nature is encouraged.17 The procurement plan is in Appendix 9 and the \ndetailed list of contract packages is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe Project will require a total of 1,698 person-months of national consulting services.18 \n51. \nThe construction supervision consultants will be hired to monitor project implementation of civil \nworks,  environmental  protection,  resettlement,  and  project  performance.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference  for  construction  supervision,  resettlement  monitoring,  and  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  data  collection  are  in  Appendix  10.  Given  the  emergency  nature  of  the \nprojects, the consultants will be recruited through single source selection. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n \n52. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  though  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EAs  and  IAs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \nThe EAs will: (a) involve the agencies responsible for oversight of each IA in bidding and \n53. \nconstruction  in  order  to  monitor  construction  quality  control  and  supervise  effective  work; \n(b) introduce  a  dual-signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works  contract  winner  also  signs  an \nanticorruption  agreement  with  the  concerned  IA;  (c) periodically  inspect  the  contractors\u2019 \nactivities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (d)  support  the  PMOs  and  the  IAs  to \nensure good governance, accountability, and transparency in project operations; and (e) initiate \nliaison  meetings  with  the  relevant  agency,  as  needed,  to  discuss  any  warnings  about,  or \ninformation  on,  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject.  The  provincial  governments  will  ensure  that  proper  accounting  and  audit  procedures \nare in place to ensure efficient and economic use of the ADB financing proceeds. Accounts and \nfinancial  statements  in  relation  to  the  Project  and  the  subprojects  will  be  maintained  and \ncertified by independent auditors acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n \n54. \nGiven the Project\u2019s urgency, advance contracting was requested by the Government for \napproval for the procurement of goods, services, and civil works, and recruitment of consultants. \nThis request is supported and approved by the Management. The Government was advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of such advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 To  encourage  community  participation  and  use  of  indigenous  materials,  methods  to  incorporate  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  may  be  used  for  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure.  Small  works  contracts  with  an \nestimated  cost  of  $20,000  or  less  in  each  case  may  be  awarded  to  community  organizations  in  accordance  with \npractices and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n\n18 Sichuan  Province  is  allocated  1,404  person-months  and  Shaanxi  Province  294  person-months  of  consulting \n\nservices. These will be provided through consulting services contracts for each province. \n\n\f8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n55. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  quick \ndisbursement is essential for effective and timely emergency assistance. Given the emergency \nnature of the project and adequate financial management capacity in both Sichuan and Shaanxi \nprovincial  financial  bureaus,  two  imprest  accounts  (one  for  each  province)  will  be  established \nimmediately after loan effectiveness and operated by the respective provincial financial bureaus. \nThese imprest accounts will be set up in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The proceeds \nof  the  imprest  advance  will  be  released  to  the  EAs  when  requested  as  reimbursement  for \nexpenditures already incurred under the Project.   \n \n56. \nThe initial amount to be deposited into each of the imprest accounts will not exceed the \nlesser of (i) 6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from the imprest accounts, or (ii) \n20%  of  the  loan  amount.  Procedures  under  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government \nand  ADB,  including  the  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure,  will  be  adopted  for \nreimbursing  and  liquidating  eligible  expenditures.  Individual  payments  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  should  not  exceed  $200,000  per  payment,  unless \notherwise  agreed  with  ADB  during  project  implementation.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \noperated  by  the  respective  provincial  financial  bureau  of  each  province,  in  accordance  with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.   \n \n\n9. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n \nADB has agreed to the provision of retroactive financing, up to a maximum of 25% of the \n57. \nloan proceeds, for reasonable eligible expenditures incurred and paid for after the occurrence of \nthe  earthquake  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  date  of  the  loan  agreement.  The \nprovision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n\n10. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n\na. \n\nReports  \n\nrelating \n\n \nThe  respective  EAs  will  establish  a  reporting  system  for  submitting  quarterly  progress \n58. \nreports  detailing  progress \nto  contract  awards,  disbursements,  and  project \nimplementation. These reports will provide feedback to management regarding procedures that \nmay  need  to  be  updated  or  improved,  and  will  provide  the  basis  for  a  consolidated  quarterly \nreport to ADB. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the EAs will provide ADB \nan  overall  project  completion  report  providing  detailed  evaluation  of  project  design,  costs, \ncontractor and consultant performance, traffic counts, social and economic impacts, and other \ndetails requested by ADB. \n \n59. \nRegular  field  reviews  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB  together  with  the  PMOs  to  monitor \nphysical  progress  of  subprojects  and  compliance  with  other  ADB  requirements  such  as \nprocurement,  quality  control,  accounting,  safeguards,  and  beneficiary  participation.  A  midterm \nreview,  to  be  conducted  in  2010,  will  assess  the  need  for  changes  in  the  implementation \narrangements to achieve the overall project objectives. \n\n \n \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fb. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \n60. \nThe  Government  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  loan  and  imprest \naccounts.  The  provincial  governments,  operating  through  their  respective  PMOs,  will  establish \nand maintain separate records for subprojects, works, goods, and services financed out of loan \nproceeds  and  will  also  maintain  separate  project  accounts  in  accordance  with  generally \naccepted accounting principles for all expenditures incurred on the Project and subprojects from \nthe loan proceeds.  \n \n61. \nDetailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  PMOs,  will  be \naudited  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are \nacceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. \nThe annual audit report will include an audit of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure, and \nwill specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds through the imprest \naccounts,  and  compliance  with  SOE  procedures.  The  EAs  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s \npolicy and requirements relating to timely submission and quality of the audited accounts.  \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n62. \nThe  PMOs  will  establish  a  systematic  project performance  monitoring  system.  A  set  of \nperformance monitoring indicators are identified and included in Appendix 11. The baseline data \nestablished for each of the selected indicators will be incorporated in the project administration \nmemorandum, with additional data collected during implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n63. \nThe  Government  requested  TA  grant  support  for  capacity  building  for  Wenchuan \nearthquake  reconstruction.  The  TA  grant  support  will  have  three  components.  TA  for  project \nimplementation will provide capacity-building support to the EAs and IAs for speedy and smooth \nimplementation, particularly with respect to procurement, disbursement, monitoring, and quality \ncontrol.  TA  for  the  education  component  will  involve  (i) establishment  of  two  model  schools, \nfocusing  on \ntechnology  and  on  natural  sciences; \n(ii) development of training materials, and provision of in-service training to teachers, including \nin  areas  such  as  student-centered  learning;  and  (iii)  teacher  capacity  building  in  the  worst-\naffected  counties.  TA  in  the  transport  sector  will  build  capacity  regarding  (i)  road  construction \nquality  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas,  and  (ii)  sustainable  rural  road  operation  and \nmaintenance systems. The details of the TA are in Appendix 12. \n \n\ninformation  and  communication \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n64. \nIn Sichuan, about 3,500 km of rural roads have been identified for ADB financing in 19 of \nthe  39  severely  affected  counties.  Within  these  19  counties,  40%  of  the  rural  roads  were \ndamaged.  The  ADB  project  will  reconstruct  and  upgrade  28%  of  the  damaged  roads.  In \nShaanxi,  317  km  of  rural  roads  and  more  than  50  bridges  have  been  identified  for  ADB \nfinancing in the four most severely affected counties, including 128 km of class III and 154 km of \nclass IV roads, and 35 km of village roads and bridges. \n \n65. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  rural  roads  and  bridges  include  (i)  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs as a result of improved traffic and road conditions, (ii) time savings for rural road \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fusers,  (iii)  savings  in  road  accident  costs  as  a  result  of  fewer  accidents,  and  (iv)  economic \nbenefits from generated traffic. The reconstruction and upgrading of rural roads in Sichuan and \nShaanxi  will  benefit  about  5.6  million  people,  three-quarters  of  whom  are  rural;  one-third  are \npoor.  Improved  availability  of  reliable  transport  to  markets  will  stimulate  cash  crop  farming  in \nremote or isolated areas, and broaden access to off-farm employment opportunities. Failure to \nreconstruct or upgrade rural roads will result in rural people in remote parts of the project area \nhaving  less  mobility;  as  a  result,  they  will  face  greater  difficulties  in  restoring  their  livelihoods \nafter  the  earthquake,  and  poor  households  in  those  regions  will  be  unable  to  benefit  from  the \nbroader  economic  development.  In  addition,  the  reconstruction  will  provide  significant \nemployment and skill training benefits for rural people. \n \n66. \nThe Project also includes the reconstruction and upgrading of schools. The ADB Project \nwill  focus  on  reconstruction  and  improvements  for  12  schools,  including  six  junior  secondary \nand  six  primary  schools.  These  will  bring  immediate  benefits  to  the  schools\u2019  16,600  students \n(including  more  than  8,000  females),  and  long-term  benefits  to  future  students  among  the \n460,000  residents  of  the  areas  serviced  by  the  schools,  about  40%  of  whom  are  from  rural \nareas of these remote counties.  \n \n67. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  regenerate  the  economy, \nrehabilitate public infrastructure  and  utilities,  and  generate employment.  The  rehabilitation  and \nthe  provision  of  education  services. \nreconstruction  of  damaged  schools  will  restore \nReconstruction  of  education  facilities  will  offer  long-term  benefits  for  APs  by  supporting \nopportunities  for  employment  and  participation  in  economic  activities.  Local  communities  and \nbeneficiaries will actively participate in the selection, design, implementation, and operation and \nmaintenance  of  all  works  carried  out  under  the  Project.  The  Project  addresses  the  needs  of \nvulnerable groups, including children in remote and poor areas. \n \n68. \nThe  merging  of  selected  schools  in  the  three  affected  counties  of  Shaanxi  under  the \neducation  component  will  lead  to  improved  economies  of  scale  and  increased  efficiency  in \neducational expenditures in affected areas through savings in administrative, instructional, and \nother  related  educational  costs.  The  schools  that  were  damaged  by  the  earthquake  had  old \nbuildings,  poor  toilets,  and  lacked  facilities  such  as  dormitories,  reading  rooms,  and  dining \nrooms, which was not conducive to learning. Construction of dormitory facilities adjacent to the \nreconstructed school buildings will enhance enrolment rates among students, including girls, in \nremote  and  mountainous  areas  of  Shaanxi  Province.  Provision  of  ancillary  facilities  such  as \nreading  and  dining  rooms,  multimedia  laboratories,  science  laboratories,  and  more  hygienic \ntoilets will make education more modern and enjoyable. \n \n69. \nBy  establishing  two  model  schools  under  the  TA  grant\u2014focusing  on  information  and \ncommunication technology and on natural sciences\u2014the Project will develop a model that can \nbe replicated in other schools in the affected counties. Teachers will benefit from the training in \nstudent-centered  methodologies  that  will  be  provided  under  the  TA  grant.  Reconstruction  of \nschools, provision of essential school equipment, and training of teachers in interactive learning \nand  other  modern  teaching  methodologies  will  demonstrate  new  approaches  that  can  be \nreplicated  and  will  help  the  provincial  government  build  a  better  education  system  in  Shaanxi \nProvince.  \n \nB. \n \n70. \nEight of the 23 project counties (six in Sichuan and two in Shaanxi) are national poverty \ncounties.  The  Wenchuan  earthquake  brought  immense  suffering  to  many  rural  and  poor \n\nSocial and Poverty Benefits \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fhouseholds  that  were  not  equipped  to  deal  with  the  disaster  and  the  reconstruction  efforts. \nConsequently, the government program has three reconstruction priorities: (i) housing, schools, \nand hospitals; (ii) rural infrastructure; and (iii) public buildings. The population of the 23 project \ncounties  is  12.1  million,  77%  of  whom  are  rural,  with  a  significant  proportion  below  the \ngovernment poverty line. There are 669 towns and townships and 7,753 administrative villages, \nincluding many poverty villages. Rural poverty results from remote and isolated locations, and a \nlack of access to transport, good farmland, good schools, and a water supply. There are some \nethnic minority villages located in three of the 23 counties, but none of the project roads, bridges, \nor schools are located in these ethnic minority villages. \n \n71. \nThe  Project  will  bring  benefits  to  the  project  area  by  (i)  reconstructing  and  improving \nroad  conditions  and  accessibility  in  townships  and  villages,  (ii)  reconstructing  and  improving \n12 schools  in  Shaanxi  in  compliance  with  seismic  codes,  and  (iii)  creating  local  employment \nopportunities  from  project  construction  and  related  activities.  The  Project  will  provide  equal \nbenefits  for  women  and  girls  through  (i)  improved  rural  roads,  which  will  facilitate  improved \ntransport services to remote mountain villages, which will in turn improve access to better health \nand  education  facilities;  and  (ii)  model  schools  with  improved  classrooms,  laboratories, \nwashrooms,  canteens,  and  dormitories.  Under  the  PRC's  compulsory  education  program \nprimary  and  junior  secondary  schools  have  no  tuition  fees,  so  girls  have  equal  opportunity  to \nattend  school.  Constructing  schools  complete  with  facilities  will  encourage  people  living  in \nremote  locations,  where  suitable  school  education  is  not  available,  to  send  their  children \n(including  girls)  to  these  schools.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 13. \n \nRural  road  construction  will  support  enhanced  livelihoods  by  ensuring  all  rural \n72. \ncommunities  have  access  to  basic  facilities,  services  and  goods,  and  will  help  individuals  and \nhouseholds manage  risks  by  providing  targeted  employment.  The  program  will  provide  for  the \ndevelopment  of  quality  rural  access  infrastructure  and  a  mechanism  whereby  temporary \nemployment will provide a safety net for vulnerable rural people. The quality rural road network \nwill connect all villages to basic rural infrastructure and services such as markets, health care, \nand  schools.  It  will  provide  increased  employment  opportunities  by  using  labor-intensive \nmethods and a private sector-led approach for all works. The rural road program will enhance \nthe  capacity  of  communities  and  the  private  sector  to  manage,  deliver,  and  maintain  public \ninfrastructure and transportation facilities through capacity development programs. The Project \nwill  build  capacity  for  earthquake-resistant  construction,  strengthened  local  government \nmechanisms,  encourage  gender  sensitization,  and  encourage  community-based  disaster \npreparedness  programs.  Safety  will  be  enhanced  through  provision  of  higher  geometric  and \nstructural standards for roads and modern seismic-resistant building codes for schools. \n \nC. \n \n73. \nRural road reconstruction generally involves upgrading the width and quality of existing \nroads  within  the  available  rights-of-way.  Based  on  the  feasibility  study  investigation,  no  land \nacquisition  or  demolition  of  structures  is  anticipated  for  the  roads  in  Sichuan.  This  will  be \nconfirmed by the local land and resources bureaus once the designs are finalized. If land does \nneed to be acquired, it will require approval by the land and resources bureaus, in which case a \nresettlement plan will be prepared and submitted  to ADB for review and concurrence. A small \namount of land may be occupied temporarily by contractors during construction; however, such \nland occupation will not be involuntary and the use of such land will also require approval from \nthe  land  and  resources  bureau.  Since  the  temporary  land  use  will  be  determined  during \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fEnvironmental Impacts  \n\nconstruction, such use will be monitored and included in the external monitoring and evaluation \nreports.  \n \n74. \nFour  of  the  10  rural  road  and  bridge  subprojects  in  Shaanxi  will  involve  some  land \nacquisition. Estimation  of  impacts and  approval  of  land  use  procedures  is  currently  underway, \nand  will  be  finalized  based  on  final  designs.  Resettlement  plans  for  these  four  subprojects \n(Hanjiang  Bridge  in  Mian  Xian  County,  the  two  class  III  roads  in  Ningqing  County,  and \nShiyangmiao Qianhe Bridge in Chencang District) will be prepared by the IAs and submitted to \nADB for review and concurrence. The costs of land acquisition and resettlement are included in \nthe cost estimates of the relevant subprojects, and will be financed by the local governments.  \n \n75. \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  key  policy  requirements  and  procedures \nfor  preparing  resettlement  plans  and  conducting  due  diligence  are  set  out  in  the  resettlement \nframework (Appendix 14). Any resettlement plans for subprojects should be submitted to ADB \nfor  review  and  concurrence  prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition  for  that  particular \nsubproject.  A  national  resettlement  expert(s)  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  engaged  by  the  EAs. \nThe  cost  of  the  national  resettlement  expert  will  be  included  in  the  project  cost  and  will  be \nfinanced from the loan. The resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nD. \n \n76. \nGiven  the  nature  of  the  project\u2019s  physical  works  (i.e.,  reconstruction  of  damaged  road \nsections  and  school  buildings),  the  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The project component initial environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  have  been  provided  by  the  county  governments  on  the  basis  of \nenvironmental  assessment  documents \nImpact \nAssessment  Law  (2002).  The  Project\u2019s  IEEs  indicate  that  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  have \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts;  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  mainly \nlimited  to  the  construction  stage.  These  impacts  will  be  reversible  in  the  short  term  and  will \naffect a limited area, and are therefore manageable. The summary IEE is in Appendix 15  and \nthe environmental assessment and review framework is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nE. \n \n77. \nA  key  selection  criterion  for  subprojects  to  be  financed  through  the  Project  is  an \nassessment of financial sustainability. This includes an assessment of availability of counterpart \nfinancing for implementation purposes as well as for future incremental recurrent costs. Based \non these arrangements and given the current macroeconomic environment, the Project is felt to \nbe financially sustainable. \n \nF. \n \n78. \nTo mitigate any lack of adequately strong commitment in implementing the Project in an \nefficient  and  timely  manner,  so  that  the  earthquake-damaged  or  -destroyed  education  and \ntransport infrastructure is rehabilitated and reconstructed, the two provinces have each set up a \nhigh-level leading group chaired by the respective vice-governor for project monitoring.  \n \n79. \nImplementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of  quality  subprojects  in  the \nvarious project sectors will be mitigated in several ways. In terms of implementation supervision, \nspecific  monitoring  mechanisms  will  include  regular  financial  audits  as  well  as  regular  design \nand construction supervision. The two EAs will be supported in undertaking this supervision by \n\nthe  PRC\u2019s  Environmental \n\nSustainability \n\nrequired  by \n\nRisks \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fdedicated PMOs and consulting inputs. Another potential risk is the IAs\u2019 lack of experience with \nADB procedures. This will be mitigated through tailored training for the IAs on ADB procedures \nimmediately after the project-related TA becomes effective. ADB will provide continuous support \nand  supervision  to  the  IAs  for  project  implementation,  including  conducting  special  review \nmissions, if required.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, Sichuan provincial government, \nfollowing  assurances,  which  are \n\nthe \n\n \n80. \nand  Shaanxi  provincial  government  have  given \nincorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nThe Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments will ensure that all subprojects \nmeet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the agreed selection criteria and implementation \narrangements, and that all subprojects are properly monitored to the satisfaction \nof ADB.  \n\nThe Government will cause the Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments to \nensure that (a) all counterpart financing necessary for the Project is provided in a \ntimely manner, and (b) additional counterpart funding is provided in the event of \nany  shortfall  of  funds  or  cost  overruns  to  complete  any  subprojects  that  have \nalready commenced construction. \n\nThe Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments will ensure that the executing \nagencies and implementing agencies actively seek community participation in the \nselection, design, and implementation of all works carried out under the Project, \nincluding maintenance of the project facilities. To that extent, a provision will be \nincluded  in  all  tender  documents  that  contractors  will  give  preference  to  local \nlabor, where applicable. \n\nThe  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  will  ensure  that  the  facilities \nprovided under the Project are operated and maintained appropriately, and that \nadequate  budgetary  and  other  resources  are  provided  for  operation  and \nmaintenance.  \n\nShaanxi  provincial  government  will  ensure  that  the  recurring  and  operational \nbudget  for  all  schools  to  be  reconstructed  under  the  Project  and  the  operation \nand maintenance budget will be provided in a timely manner.  \n\nThe Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments will ensure that all construction \nof  roads,  bridges,  and  schools  is  carried  out  in  strict  compliance  with  the \nappropriate  engineering  specifications  and  building  code  approved  by  the \nGovernment for seismic-resistant buildings.  \n\nThe  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  will  ensure  that  adequate \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  in  accordance  with  (a)  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  regulations  and  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  are \nincorporated into all subproject design and implementation. The Government will \nensure that the environmental management plan (EMP) to mitigate any adverse \nenvironmental impacts is implemented, and in the event that unexpected impacts \noccur,  remedial  measures  are  prepared  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The  Sichuan \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n\fand  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  will  ensure  that  the  agreed  environmental \nassessment  review  framework  is  applied  in  selecting  subprojects,  that  a \nsubproject for which an environmental assessment study is required has such a \nstudy  completed,  and  that  a  subproject  for  which  government  environmental \nclearance is required obtains such clearance prior to the award of any contracts \nfor that subproject.  \n\n \n(viii)  The  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  will  cause  the  EAs  and  IAs  to \nensure  (a)  all  the  subprojects  are  screened  for  resettlement  impacts  and  those \nsubprojects with impacts have short resettlement plans prepared and approved in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  framework;  (b)  all  resettlement  plans  are \nimplemented in accordance with their terms; (c) all land and rights-of-way required \nby  the  Project  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (d)  the  provisions  of  the \nresettlement  plan,  including  compensation  and  entitlements  for  APs,  will  be \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  government  laws  and  regulations \nand  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995);  (e)  compensation  and \nresettlement  assistance  are  given  to  the  APs  prior  to  dispossession  and \ndisplacement;  (f)  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities;  (g)  any  obligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement  plan \nbudget estimate are met; and (h) the APs will be at least as well off as they would \nhave been in the absence of the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nThe  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  will  cause  the  EAs  and  IAs  to \n(a) ensure that civil works contractor specifications include requirements to comply \nwith  the  resettlement  framework  and  relevant  resettlement  plans,  including \ntemporary  land  occupation  requirements;  (b)  supervise  the  contractors  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  resettlement  plan,  applicable  laws  and \nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy;  and  (c)  encourage \ncontractors,  as  a  priority,  to  provide  employment  to  at  least  50%  of  the  APs  of \nemployable age. \n\nThe  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  will  cause  the  EAs  and  IAs  to \nensure  that  (a)  adequate  staff  and  resources  are  committed  to  supervising  and \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  maintaining  related \ndocumentation; and (b) an independent resettlement expert(s) acceptable to ADB \nis engaged by the EAs, if necessary, to conduct due diligence and report to ADB, \nprovide  guidance  to  IAs  on  resettlement  plan  preparation,  carry  out  independent \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement,  and  prepare  and  submit  annual \nmonitoring reports to ADB. \n\nThe Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments will cause the EAs and IAs to \nencourage the contractors to maximize the employment of poor local people who \nmeet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  construction  of  the  project  roads, \nbridges and schools.  \n\nThe Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments will cause the EAs and IAs to \nensure that civil works contractors comply with national labor legislation. Bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts will include clauses prohibiting child labor for \nconstruction and maintenance activities, ensuring equal pay for men and women \nfor work of equal value, and requiring a timely payment for workers on a monthly \nbasis. The compliance will be monitored by the IAs. \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f(xiii)  The Sichuan and Shaanxi provincial governments will cause the EAs and IAs to \n(a)  take  all  reasonable  and  necessary  steps  to  encourage  women  living  in  the \nproject  area  to  participate  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the  Project, \nincluding  causing  the  contractors  to  maximize  their  employment  of  women  in \nconnection with the Project; (b) ensure that for works that can be done by both \nmale  and  female  workers,  female  workers  will  be  given  equal  opportunities  for \nemployment; and (c) ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998).  \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n81. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$400,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Wenchuan \nEarthquake  Reconstruction  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n11 February 2009 \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\nPerformance Targets and/or \nIndicatorsa \n\n \nGovernment statistics \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nAccelerated restoration of \ntransport and education \ninfrastructure in the \nearthquake-affected areas of \nSichuan and Shaanxi \nprovinces \n\nOutcome \nPeople\u2019s access to transport \nand education infrastructure  \nis restored to pre-earthquake \nlevels in 19 counties of \nSichuan Province and four \ncounties in Shaanxi Province \n\nOutputs \n1.

Many rural and urban houses collapsed, there was large-scale damage \nto  infrastructure  facilities  and  severe  environmental  destruction,  and  agriculture  and  industry \nsuffered heavy losses. The earthquake resulted in an uncommonly high number of hazardous \ngeologic events, such as landslides, rock falls, and debris flows, and created barrier lakes. The \ndisaster\u2019s total impact represents 3.3% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in FY 2007, and \nhad  a  significant  impact  on  the  economy  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Direct \neconomic  losses  caused  by  the  Wenchuan  earthquake  are  estimated  at  CNY852,309  million, \nand  losses  in  Sichuan,  Shaanxi,  and  Gansu  provinces  are  estimated  at  CNY845,136  million \n(99.16% of the total). In addition, indirect losses from the Wenchuan earthquake could be much \nhigher than estimated above, due to the nature and scale of the damage and loss incurred. \n \nLosses  equalled  CNY771,770  million  in  Sichuan  Province  (91.32%  of  the  total  for  the \n2. \nthree  provinces),  CNY50,535  million  (5.98%)  in  Gansu  Province,  and  CNY22,830  million \n(2.70%)  in  Shaanxi  Province.  Losses  in  the  three  provinces\u2019  social  sectors  were  CNY465,275 \nmillion  (55.05%  of  total  losses),  with  CNY188,136  million  in  infrastructure  losses  (22.26%  of \ntotal losses).  \n \nA. \n \nHousing.  Numerous  houses  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  collapsed  during  the \n3. \nearthquake. The total damage to housing is CNY403,894 million, representing almost half of the \ntotal  damage  and  losses,  with  damage  concentrated  within  a  109,857  square  kilometre  (km2) \narea.  More  than  half  (57%)  of  the  damaged  housing  was  residential;  damage  to  residential \nhousing in rural areas is estimated at CNY124,843 million, and in urban areas at CNY106,848 \nmillion. Most of the damage to the housing sector was concentrated in Sichuan Province, which \nincludes  the  10  worst-affected  districts  and  the  29  most  seriously  affected  counties  (cities  or \ndistricts). These districts sustained CNY363,220 million in total damages, representing 90% of \nthe total damages caused by the Wenchuan earthquake. In addition, property losses suffered by \ncitizens in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces were reported to be CNY37,408 million.  \n \n4. \nEducation.  A  total  of  17,951  educational  institutions  were  fully  or  partially  damaged  in \nthe  earthquake-affected  areas,  resulting  in  losses  of  CNY4,676  million,  including  CNY4,074 \nmillion in Sichuan, CNY541 million in Gansu, and CNY61 million in Shaanxi. There are 12,253 \ndamaged  educational  institutions  in  Sichuan  Province,  5,455  in  Shaanxi  Province,  and  243  in \nGansu  Province.  The  counties  with  the  most  fully  destroyed  primary  schools  are  Mao  (153), \nPingwu (137), Wenchuan (129) and Beichuan (83); the jurisdictions with the greatest number of \naffected  primary  students  are  An  County  (121,905),  Jiangyou  City  (98,923),  Pengzhou  City \n(90,819),  and  Dujiangyan  City  (79,701).

The  preliminary  losses  are \nestimated  to  be  CNY38.4  billion.  Losses  in  the  agriculture  sector  were  estimated  in  terms  of \ncrop yields, economic forests, livestock, and fisheries. Crop and forestry losses were assessed \naccording to the disaster-affected areas of crops and forests. Likewise the economic losses of \nlivestock and fisheries were assessed according to the numbers of dead livestock and fish. The \nassessment  noted  that  there  was  a  decline  of  rural  household  income  and  an  increase  in \nunemployment as a result of these losses.  \n \n17. \nThe total damaged crop area was 361,966 ha, including 332,200 ha in Sichuan, 23,210 \nha in Gansu, and 6,557 ha in Shaanxi provinces. The disaster caused the deaths of 4,389,239 \nlivestock animals and 29,913,177 poultry. Agricultural machinery damage included 894.9 million \nfarm  implements,  15,494  irrigation  and  drainage  stations,  5,053  ha  of  machinery  sheds,  and \n25,013  km  of  farm  tracks.  The  earthquake  damaged  5,012,840  ha  of  economic  forests,  and \n33,981 ha of fisheries area. The three affected provinces suffered combined losses of 52% in \nlivestock, 31% in forestry, 15% in crop yields, and 2% in fisheries. \n \n18. \nIndustry.  The  effects  on  industry  were  severe.  Roads  were  blocked,  electricity  supply \nwas stopped, equipment was destroyed, and inventories were buried. In total, 18,035 industrial \nenterprises were damaged or destroyed in the three main affected provinces, including 16,320 \nin  Shichuan,  833  in  Gansu,  and  882  in  Shaanxi.  Total  losses  to  the  industrial  sector  are \nestimated  to  be  more  than  CNY64.79  billion  (CNY62.7  billion  in  Sichuan  Province,  CNY1.29 \nbillion  in  Gansu  Province,  and  CNY0.8  billion  in  Shaanxi  Province).

Numerous medium and small enterprises were \naffected.  The  total  damaged  area  of  factory  buildings  amounted  to  473,852  million  square \nmeters (m2), and 367,521 ancillary facilities were also damaged. \n \n19. \nService.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  disaster,  wholesale  and  retail  traders  were  unable  to \nwork,  transportation  was  largely  halted,  and  service  establishments  were  closed  for  several \nweeks.  Most  tourist  destinations,  including  cultural  heritage  sites  in  Sichuan  Province,  were \nwrecked by the earthquake. Estimated overall losses to the service sector (including commerce, \ntourism, real estate, and finance) are CNY41.13 billion, comprising CNY40.28 billion in losses in \nSichuan Province, CNY0.61 billion in Gansu Province, and CNY0.24 billion in Shaanxi Province. \nAbout 138,000 (or 20%) of the commerce and trade network units (including individual business \nhouseholds, markets, retailing, etc.) in the disaster areas were affected; of these, 49,000 were \ncompletely  ruined,  63,000  were  partially  damaged,  and  26,000  were  lightly  damaged. \nApproximately 130,000 of these units were in Sichuan.

The  total  cultural  heritage  losses  were \nCNY8.97 billion (CNY8.42 billion in Sichuan, CNY400 million in Gansu, and CNY151 million in \nShaanxi). \n \nE. \n \n24. \nThe  earthquake  disaster  area  is  a  very  important  ecological  safety  barrier  for  Sichuan \nProvince  and  for  the  middle  and  lower  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River.  The  earthquake  caused \nserious damage to the ecosystem and its service functions, which greatly threatens ecological \nstability in this region.  \n \n \n\nEcological Sector \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nTRANSPORT SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  2005,  the  Sichuan  Province  road  network  was  114,694  kilometers  (km)  in  length. \n1. \nRoad density in Sichuan was 23.4 km per 100 square km (km2), slightly higher than the national \naverage. The network included 76,401 km of classified roads (66.6%): 1,758 km of expressways \n(1.5%); 1,496 km of class I roads (1.3%); 9,633 km of class II roads, (8.4%); and 63,514 km of \nclass III and IV roads (55.4%). The length of unclassified roads was 38,642 km.  \n \n2. \nIn 2005, the road network of Shaanxi Province was 54,491 km. Road density in Shaanxi \nwas  15.2  km  per  100  km2,  lower  than  national  average.  The  network  included  1,300  km  of \nexpressways (2.4%); 359 km of class I roads (0.7%); 5,782 km of class II roads (10.6%); 14,657 \nkm of class III roads (26.9%), and 32,392 km of class IV and unclassified roads.  \n \n3. \nRural road development is a priority for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to achieve \nthe goal of a harmonious society. Rural roads are fundamental infrastructure that provide people \nwith basic access, help improve quality of life, assist in reducing poverty, and are essential for \neconomic  development  of  rural  communities.  At  present,  the  condition  of  many  rural  roads  is \ninadequate,  most  sections  are  unpaved  and  they  are  not  designed  using  national  design \nstandards.  Rural  roads  should  be  designed  using  a  minimum  of  class  IV  road  or  special  rural \nroad  design  standards.  The  State  Council  approved  the  Rural  Road  Development  Plan  in \nFebruary  2005.  The  overall  objective  of  the  plan  is  to  make  all  townships  and  villages  in  the \nPRC accessible by paved roads by 2020, thereby forming a rural road network of a high service \nlevel, and making travel more rapid, safe, and comfortable for farmers. The goal is that by 2010, \n(i) all townships in the PRC will be connected by paved roads; (ii) all villages in eastern, central, \nand  western  regions  will  be  connected  to  paved  roads;  and  (iii)  there  will  be  3.1  million  km  of \nrural roads.  \n \n4. \nIn  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  Sichuan  plans  to  open  a  total  of  11,250  km  of  new  roads, \nproviding  paved  road  connection  for  90%  of  its  townships.  In  addition,  Shaanxi  is  planning \n10,000  km  of  rural  road  renovation  and  28,000  km  of  new  rural  road  construction  to  provide \npaved road connections for 450 townships and 5,600 villages in the province.  \n \n5. \nThe  damage  and  needs  assessment  undertaken  by  the  Government  and  validated  by \nthe technical assistance (TA) consultants1 noted that the Wenchuan earthquake caused serious \ndamage to rural infrastructure, and that the damage to rural roads was particularly serious, with \n39,948 km of rural roads damaged, including 29,345 km in Sichuan, 3,189 km in Shaanxi, and \n7,414 km in Gansu (Table A3).  \n \n\nTable A3: Summary Damage to Rural Transport Infrastructure \n(km) \nSichuan \n29,345  \n39 \n342 \n\nItem \nRural Roads \nCounty Bus Stations \nTownship Bus Stops \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: The State Overall Planning for Post-Wenchuan Earthquake Restoration and Reconstruction. \n\nShaanxi \n3,189  \n2 \n3 \n\nTotal \n39,948  \n49 \n363 \n\nGansu \n7,414  \n8 \n18 \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nProject Objective \n\nReconstruction Planning and Design  \n\nB. \n \n6. \nThe  rural  road  reconstruction  will  support  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provinces  in  restoring \nthe  livelihood  and  economic  activities  of  the  affected  population,  and  accelerate  poverty \nalleviation in the earthquake-affected areas that are vulnerable to a high poverty incidence. \n \n7. \nMost  damaged  roads  were  constructed  by  villagers  without  proper  design  standards, \nand  will  be  improved  by  the  Project.  The  current  pavement  did  not  allow  vehicles  to  operate \nproperly because of poor surface maintenance. The width of some sections was insufficient to \nallow  two-way  traffic,  and  drainage  systems  were  not  properly  designed  and  of  insufficient \ncapacity  for  the  anticipated  (design)  rainfall  intensity.  Many  slopes  were  not  protected.  The \nnational  highway  design  standards  and  seismic  codes  will  be  employed  during  road \nreconstruction, and the higher design standards will provide faster, safer, and easier access to \nmarkets  and  public  services  for  villagers,  and  entail  lower  maintenance  costs  for  local \ngovernments.   \n \nC. \n \n8. \nAll roads are part of the overall reconstruction plan approved by the State Council and \nthe provincial rural road network planned for reconstruction. The new alignment is planned on \nthe  original  right-of-way.  These  roads  will  adopt  higher  design  standards,  and  the  design \nstandards  of  most  roads  is  class  III  or  IV,  with  a  few  class  II  standard  roads.  The  minimum \npavement width is 4.5 meters (m) for sections with one-way traffic. The minimum shoulder width \nis 0.25 m (to be installed on both sides).  Drainage will be designed using rainfall intensity of 5-\nyear recurrence. Slope protection such as retaining walls will be installed where needed. Traffic \nsafety equipment such as road marking and signs will be installed.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nTo  ensure  the  construction  quality,  the  civil  works  contractors  will  be  provided  clear \ninstructions  in  the  bidding  documents  and  their  activities  will  be  supervised.  The  civil  works \nbidding document, including technical specifications, will be prepared by the design consultant, \nand  will  describe  the  construction  method,  construction  material  quality,  site  management \nrequirements, and environmental protection measures. The civil works will be supervised under \nthe  2004  Rural  Road  Construction  Quality  Control  Ordinance  and  the  2007  Supervision \nSpecifications  for  Construction  of  Highway  Engineering,  as  prepared  by  the  Government. \nAccordingly,  implementing  agencies  will  designate  qualified  construction  supervisors,  who  will \nreside on site and will monitor all civil works activities to ensure adequate construction methods, \nquality of material, construction safety, and environmental protection. The supervisors\u2019 activities \nwill be documented and will be reported periodically to the implementing agencies.  \n \nE. \n \n10. \nA  rural  road  maintenance  system  was  being  established  before  the  Wenchuan \nearthquake.  The  Government  provided  guidelines  on  rural  road  maintenance  reform  in  2005, \nunder which provincial governments would establish their own rural road maintenance systems. \nThe  county  governments  are  primarily  responsible  for  rural  road  maintenance.  The  county \ngovernments  prepare  maintenance  plans,  bear  maintenance  costs,  supervise  maintenance \nactivities, and organize township and village governments\u2019 road maintenance activities. Annual \nmaintenance cost are budgeted at CNY15,000 per km for county roads, CNY6,000 per km for \ntownship  roads,  and  CNY1,000  per  km  for  village  roads.  These  are  funded  by  a  road \n\nConstruction Quality \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\nmaintenance fee. Municipal governments provide subsidies for a periodic maintenance budget \nwhen needed. According to the national guidelines, rural road maintenance is being outsourced. \nMany  counties  have  already  hired  private  companies  for  rural  road  maintenance  through \ncompetitive  bidding,  which  is  carried  out  every  3  years.  After  the  project  road  reconstruction, \nrural  roads  will  be  maintained  adequately  using  the  prevailing  maintenance  system  in  the  two \nprovinces.  \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSOCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nPrior to the earthquake (at the end of 2007), Shaanxi Province had 18,953 primary and \nsecondary  education  facilities,  which  were  adequate  to  serve  the  population  of  around  37 \nmillion, and provided coverage to the province\u2019s urban and rural population.  \n \n2. \nThe  damage  and  needs  assessment  undertaken  by  the  Government  and  validated  by \nthe  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants1 noted  that  the  extent  of  damage  to  the  education \nsector was high and the buildings were not designed to an appropriate seismic code. Sichuan \nand Shaanxi are among the worst-affected provinces. In the earthquake-affected areas, 17,951 \neducational  institutions  were  fully  or  partially  damaged,  including  12,253  in  Sichuan  Province, \n5,455  in  Shaanxi  Province  and  243  in  Gansu  Province.  Many  of  these  schools  are  at  risk  of \ncollapsing  as  they  have  sustained  significant  damage.  These  losses  have  resulted  in  a \nsignificant  disruption  of  both  primary  and  secondary  education  services.  The  affected  schools \noccupy 3.65 million square meters (m2) and the economic losses in Shaanxi's education sector \nconstitute CNY2.2 billion. \n \n3. \nEducational  institutions  of  all  levels,  from  primary  schools  to  degree  colleges,  have \nsuffered  substantial  damage.  The  earthquake  affected  40  counties  of  Shaanxi  Province,  and \nthree  counties\u2014Chencang,  Lueyang,  and  Mian  Xian\u2014were  particularly  hard  hit.  In  Shaanxi, \n5,455  schools  (about  25%  of  all  schools)  were  damaged  during  the  earthquake.  It  is  reported \nthat 11 students died, and 221 students and 10 teachers were injured. A summary of damage to \neducational institutions is in Table A4.1. \n \n\nTable A4.1: Summary of Damage to Compulsory Educational Institutions in Shaanxia \n\nInstitution \n\nPrimary School  \nJunior Secondary School \nSenior Secondary School \n \na  Data  is  not  available  for  technical  secondary  schools,  vocational  schools,  special  schools,  and  higher \n\nTotal \n\nTotal Number of \nInstitutions \n16,316  \n2,001 \n636  \n18,953 \n\nNumber of Damaged \nInstitutions  \n4,181 \n882 \n184 \n5,247 \n\neducational institutions. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nThe  Government  responded  quickly  to  the  earthquake  emergency.  In  Shaanxi,  the \n4. \nGovernment has provided temporary teaching facilities in heavily affected areas in the form of \nmetal tents, where teaching and learning has continued. In addition, the Government organized \ntraining targeted for head teachers in affected schools on how to run schools, and how to teach \nstudents in emergency situations. The Government has plans to reconstruct 731 schools in 38 \ncounties  of  Shaanxi,  which  will  cost  CNY5.7  billion  and  will  occupy  4.51  million  m2. \nReconstruction will be carried out in batches over 2009\u20132010. Reconstruction of the first batch \nof education facilities has already begun. The Government is financing the reconstruction of 117 \nschools, including 63 primary and 51 junior secondary schools, occupying 0.84 million m2 at a \ntotal  cost  of  CNY1.65  billion.  However,  the  education  reconstruction  needs  are  enormous  and \nwill take a substantial amount of time and resources to complete. \n \nThe  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  has  requested  the  Asian \n5. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to finance reconstruction of 12 partly and completely destroyed high-\npriority  government  school  buildings  in  Shaanxi\u2019s  three  worst-affected  counties  of  Chencang, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\nObjective \n\nLueyang,  and  Mian  Xian.  Immediate  restoration  of  education  facilities  in  the  worst-affected \ncounties will benefit students, parents, teachers, and communities.  \n \n6. \nLueyang  county  has  120  educational  institutions  (consisting  of  eight  kindergartens,  94 \nprimary  schools,  11  junior  secondary  schools,  one  senior  secondary  school,  one  secondary \ntechnical  school,  one  complex  school2 and  one  teacher  training  college),  which  serve  24,511 \nstudents.  The  earthquake  has  caused  different  degrees  of  damage  to  primary  and  secondary \nschools in the county.3 There are 138 educational institutions in Mian Xian county (including six \nkindergartens,  113  primary  schools,  one  compulsory  complex  school, 4 11  junior  secondary \nschools,  one  senior  secondary  school,  one  complex  secondary  school, 5  one  secondary \ntechnical school and one teacher training college); enrolment is 25,511 students, and there are \n1,995  teachers.  The  earthquake  damaged  132  of  Mian  Xian  county\u2019s  schools.  There  are  273 \nschools  in  Chencang  county,  including  213  primary  schools,  43  junior  secondary  and  eight \nsenior  schools,  one  special  school  and  one  teacher  training  college;  91,486  students  are \nenrolled, and 6,218 teachers work in the county. The earthquake damaged 176 schools with a \ntotal  area  of  12.6  million  m2,  and  67,521  students  were  affected  to  differing  degrees  by  the \nearthquake.   \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  contribute  to  reversing  the  devastating  impact  of \nthe  Wenchuan  earthquake  and  to  enable  people  to  resume  and  improve  their  livelihoods  and \nreturn to normal life. The education component will focus on reconstructing and rehabilitating 12 \nhigh-priority schools. Reconstructing the schools early would ensure that disruption to provision \nof education services is minimized.  \n \n8. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  12  high-priority  earthquake-damaged \neducation facilities in the three worst-affected counties in Shaanxi Province. Reconstruction will \nadopt  improved  earthquake-resistant  design.  Some  essential  furniture  and  equipment  will  also \nbe procured for selected reconstructed and repaired schools. A general principle of \u201cbuild back \nbetter\u201d will be followed and rebuilt schools will be better of better quality and design, and include \nancillary  facilities\u2014such  as  dormitories,  dining  rooms,  reading  rooms,  and  toilet  facilities\u2014as \npart of new construction. \n \n9. \nThis  approach  is  advocated  in  the  short-term  recovery  strategy  recommended  in  the \ndamage  and  needs  assessment  and  agreed  with  the  Government.  By  financing  the  most \nurgently  needed  components  and  works,  the  ADB  loan  will  support  a  portion  of  the \nto \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  program,  provide  assistance \nvulnerable groups, help restore the economic activity essential to the survival of residents in the \nheavily  affected  areas,  and  restore  and  improve  the  provision  of  education  services. \nReconstructed  schools  with  improved  seismic  designs  and  improved  teaching  and  learning \nfacilities  will  serve  as  model  schools  for  the  reconstruction  of  the  remaining  damaged  and \naffected schools that require rebuilding and repair.  \n \n10. \nThe selection of the various education facilities under the Project is based on the needs \nassessment  exercise  undertaken  and  the  priorities  determined  by  the  Shaanxi  provincial \ngovernment. The selection is based on the following criteria: \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2  One school that covers grades 1\u201312. \n3  Three hundred and sixty-five classrooms collapsed.  \n4  One school that covers grades 1\u20139. \n5  One school that covers grades 7\u201312. \n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\neducation facilities are located in the earthquake affected zone in Shaanxi; \nthe work address the basic emergency needs in the affected areas; \nsubprojects  are  considered  a  priority  for  ADB  assistance  by  the  Shaanxi \nprovincial government; and \nsubprojects are technically feasible, cost efficient, and financially sustainable. \n\n \n11. \nTA  grant  support  will  be  provided  for  capacity  building  to  support  the  operation  of  the \nnew  schools  through  establishment  of  model  schools,  training  of  master  teachers,  and \nassistance to the Shaanxi Bureau of Education to reestablish the education system in the worst-\naffected counties. Grant support will involve (i) establishment of two model schools, focusing on \ninformation and communication technology and on natural sciences; (ii) needs assessment and \ndevelopment of training materials; and (iii) provision of in-service training to teachers, including \nin areas such as student-centered and active learning. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nestimates are provided in Table A4.2.  \n\nThe cost of the education subcomponent is estimated at $24.4 million.

County  education  bureaus  in  Chencang,  Lueyang,  and  Mian  Xian \ncounties will be the implementing agencies (IAs). Leading groups have been set up at the three \ncounties to oversee implementation. The county-level IAs will undertake overall management of \nthe  education  component,  including  (i)  procurement  of  civil  works  and  equipment,  (ii) \nsupervision  of  construction  for  quality  assurance,  (iii) coordination  with  other  departments  and \nline agencies, (iv) monitoring, and (v) audit of accounts and preparation of progress reports. The \nIAs  will  undertake  procurement  under  the  oversight  of  the  county  leading  groups,  which  will \ninclude  finance  bureau  representation.  The  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparation  of  the \nlayout  for  primary  and  secondary  schools,  including  detailed  engineering  with  seismic \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nprovisions,  bid  preparation,  assistance  in  procurement,  supervision/contract  administration  of \ncivil  works,  quality  assurance  of  civil  works,  and  procurement  of  equipment;  and  (ii)  project \nmanagement and reporting.  \n \nE. \n \n15. \nThe  EAs  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  detailing  the  progress  of \ncontract awards, disbursement, and project implementation, based on the reports prepared by \nthe IAs. In addition, regular field reviews will be carried out by ADB together with the EAs and \nIAs to monitor physical progress of civil works for quality assurance and compliance with other \nADB  requirements  such  as  procurement,  accounting  and  consultation/participation  of \nnongovernment organizations and communities, as applicable. \n \nThe  Government  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  loan  and  imprest \n16. \naccounts.  The  EAs,  operating  through  their  respective  project  monitoring  offices  (PMOs),  will \nestablish  and  maintain  separate  records  for  subprojects,  works,  goods  and  services  financed \nout of the loan proceeds. Detailed consolidated annual project accounts as maintained by PMO \nwill be audited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference \nare  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal \nyear. \n \nA  set  of  performance  monitoring  indicators,  including  qualitative  indicators,  will  be \n17. \nidentified  and  collected  during  implementation,  and  the  PMOs  will  implement  the  necessary \narrangements for a systematic project performance monitoring system. \n \nF. \n \n18. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  rebuild  the  economy, \nrehabilitate public infrastructure  and  utilities,  and  generate employment.  The  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of damaged schools will restore disrupted education services. Reconstruction of \neducation facilities will offer long-term benefits for affected persons by supporting opportunities \nfor  employment  and  participation  in  economic  activities.  Local  communities  and  beneficiaries \nwill actively participate in the selection, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance \nof  all  works  carried  out  under  the  Project.  The  Project  addresses  the  needs  of  vulnerable \ngroups, including children in remote and poor areas. \n \n19. \nThe  merging  of  selected  schools  in  the  three  affected  counties  of  Shaanxi  under  the \neducation component will improve economies of scale and increase the efficiency of educational \nexpenditures in affected areas through savings in administrative, instructional and other related \neducational costs. Construction of dormitory and ancillary facilities adjacent to the reconstructed \nschool  buildings  will  enhance  enrolment  rates  among  students  in  remote  and  mountainous \nareas of Shaanxi Province.   \n \n20. \nBy  establishing  two  model  schools,  focusing  on  information  and  communication \ntechnology and on natural sciences, the Project will develop a model that can be replicated in \nother schools in the affected counties. Teachers will benefit from the training in student-centered \nmethodologies  that  will  be  provided  under  the  grant.  Reconstruction  of  schools,  provision  of \nessential  school  equipment,  and  training  of  teachers  in  interactive  learning  and  other  modern \nteaching  methodologies will  help  the  provincial  government  build  a  better  education  system  in \nShaanxi Province.  \n \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates of Sichuan Rural Road \n($ million)a \n \n\n3\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCost \n\n$ \n\n282.7 \n0.2 \n12.6 \n295.5 \n\n13.9\n\nADB \n\nGovernment \n\n$ \n\n% of Cost \nCategoryb \n\n$ \n\n% of Cost \nCategory \n\n277.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n277.0  \n\n0.0 \n\n \n\n \n92 \n0 \n0 \n92 \n\n0 \n\n5.7 \n0.2 \n12.6 \n18.5 \n\n13.9 \n\n14 \n0 \n31 \n45 \n\n34 \n\n1.

However, if a new school is proposed to be included, the selection \nwill be based on the following criteria. \n \n\nthe  State  Overall  Plan \n\nSubprojects should be located in one of the four earthquake-affected counties of \nShaanxi  Province,  and  should  be  part  of  the  program  for  rehabilitation  of \nfor  Post-Wenchuan \nfacilities  under \neducational \nEarthquake Restoration and Reconstruction. \nSelection  of  the  educational  institute  should  be  based  on  timeliness  criteria \n(matching the readiness of the subprojects with the availability of loan and other \nfunds, as applicable) and consider the magnitude of socioeconomic impacts.  \nSchools located in the remote isolated area will be given preference.  \nIt is preferable to avoid any area that requires major resettlement. However, for \nany  school  involving \nland  acquisition  or  resettlement,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, as set out in the resettlement framework, will be applied.  \nIt is preferable to avoid any serious environmental adverse impacts.

The  Emergency \nAssistance for Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction Project will provide $300 million for rural \nroad reconstruction in Sichuan Province and $100 million for reconstruction of rural roads and \nbridges and primary and middle schools in Shaanxi Province. The Project seeks to (i) build on \nthe  immediate  relief  provided  by  the  Government  in  the  earthquake-affected  provinces; \n(ii) contribute to coordinated rehabilitation and reconstruction by different development partners \nand  the  Government;  and  (iii) specifically  address  sustainable  recovery  priorities  by  providing \nindirect  livelihood  support  through  public  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  which \ngenerates  public  employment  and  underpins  the  restoration  of  livelihood  activities  by \nrehabilitating  roads,  bridges,  and  schools.  The  Government  also  requested  grant  support  for \ncapacity  building  for  project  implementation,  and  the  Project\u2019s  education  and  transport \ncomponents.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  in  ensuring  smooth  and  speedy  project \nimplementation, and provide support to the transport and education investment components. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  TA  grant  support  will  have  three  components.  The  project  implementation \ncomponent  will  provide  capacity-building  support  to  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies \nfor  speedy  and  smooth  implementation,  particularly  regarding  procurement,  disbursement, \nmonitoring,  and  quality  control.  The  TA \ninvolve \n(i) establishment of two model schools, focusing on information and communication technology \nand  on  natural  sciences;  (ii)  development  of  training  materials,  and  provision  of  in-service \ntraining  to  teachers,  including  in  areas  such  as  student-centered  learning;  and  (iii)  teacher \ncapacity  building  in  the  worst-affected  counties.  In  the  transport  sector,  the  TA  will  provide \ncapacity building  regarding (i) the provision of guidance regarding road construction quality in \nremote  and  mountainous  areas,  and  (ii)  sustainable  rural  road  operation  and  maintenance \nsystems.  \n \nC. \n \nIndividual consultants will be hired to implement the TA. For the project implementation \n3. \ncomponent,  the  consultants  will  assist  the  executing  agencies  (EAs)  and  the  implementing \nagencies (IAs) in project implementation, project monitoring, and reporting. The consultants will \nprovide  capacity-building  support  to  the  staff  of  the  EAs  and  IAs  and  the  project  monitoring \noffices  regarding  ADB  procedures  on  procurement,  safeguards,  project  performance  and \nreporting. They will also help in establishing the initial project implementation system and train \nstaff in its operation. For the education component, the consultants will provide capacity-building \nsupport  to  the  teachers  in  the  affected  counties,  develop  the  training  materials  for  student-\ncentered  learning,  and  help  in  establishing  the  two  model  schools,  including  procuring  the \nnecessary  equipment  for  information  and communication  technology  and  science  laboratories. \nThey  will  work  closely  with  the  EAs  and  IAs  to  develop  the  curriculum  for  teaching  disaster \npreparedness  in  the  schools  and  carrying  out  mock  drills  for  safe  evacuation  in  emergencies. \nFor  the  transport  component,  the  consultants  will  review  current  construction  techniques  and \nmethods  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas,  compare  these  with  the  existing  seismic  and \nbuilding  codes,  and  recommend  practices  that  can  be  adopted  in  the  road  and  bridge \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nthe  education  component  will \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nconstruction.  The  consultants  will  also  review  the  operation  and  maintenance  system  for  the \nrural  roads  and  recommend  possible  options  that  can  be  adopted  by  local  governments  to \nestablish  a  sustainable  and  reliable  operation  and  maintenance  system  for  the  rural  roads. \nCapacity-building  support  in  the  form  of  training  will  be  provided  for  all  the  three  components. \nWorkshops  and  seminars  will  be  organized  to  disseminate  the  TA  findings.  The  TA  will  be \nundertaken in close consultation with the EAs, IAs, local and provincial governments, and other \nstakeholders.  The  study  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  policy  dialogue  and  will  consider  all \nprevious studies by the Government, ADB, the World Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies.  \n \nD. \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000. The Government has requested that \n4. \nADB  finance  $700,000  and  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000,  which  will  cover  office \naccommodation  and  the  counterpart  staff  required  to  implement  the  TA.

The consultants \nwill  work  closely  with  the  EAs.  The  EAs  will  provide  adequate  counterpart  staff  with  relevant \nwork  experience  during  implementation,  arrange  meetings,  and  coordinate  with  concerned \ngovernment agencies to facilitate the work of the consultants.  \n\nimplementation  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n53\n\nTA implementation arrangements will provide flexibility to allow adjustment in consultant \n6. \nterms of reference, and the duration and schedule of expert inputs. ADB will recruit a national \nconsultant who will work as the TA coordinator and will supervise and coordinate day-to-day TA \nactivities,  including  monitoring  progress,  resolving  problems,  arranging  meetings,  and  liaising \nwith  the  government  agencies  concerned.  The  TA  coordinator  will  submit  monthly  reports  to \nADB  on  TA  implementation  progress.  The  project  implementation  component  will  require \nrecruitment  of  four  national  consultants  with  expertise  in  ADB  procedures  and  project \nimplementation; the education component will require recruitment of three national consultants \nwith  expertise  in  teachers  training,  information  and  communication  technology  education,  and \nscience  education;  and  the  transport  component  will  require  recruitment  of  two  national \nconsultants  with  expertise  in  rural  road  construction  and  maintenance.  Consultants  will  be \nengaged by ADB as individuals, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  consultants.  ADB  may  consider  direct  selection  of  qualified  national  and/or \ninternational organizations, local institutions, and/or short-term resource persons, where justified \nby  efficacy,  efficiency,  and/or  urgency  in  completing  activities.  To  facilitate  the  work  of  the \nconsultants,  and  to  ensure  that  the  EAs  benefits  from  their  experience,  the  EAs  will  provide \nadequate counterpart staff with relevant work experience during TA implementation.  \n \n7. \nTo  respond  quickly  to  urgent  and  evolving  needs,  procurement  of  goods  under  the  TA \nwill incorporate greater flexibility. Unless otherwise agreed upon by ADB, the project monitoring \noffices  will  procure  all  goods  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  delivery,  shopping  and  national  competitive  bidding \nwith  abbreviated  bidding  periods  will  be  applied,  as  considered  appropriate,  to  procure  the \nagreed-upon  goods.  To  ensure  timely  provision  of  goods  and  services,  an  advance  payment \nfacility will be established. All TA funds will be disbursed and the advance payment facility will \nbe established in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008).  \n \nThe TA will be implemented from March 2009 to October 2011. In view of the nature of \n8. \nthe  disaster,  TA  reviews  will  carefully  assess  implementation  arrangements  and  approaches, \nand appropriate adjustments will be instituted as needed. \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry and Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Emergency Assistance for Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction \nProject \n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nEast Asia Department/ \nTransport Division \n\nProject \u2013 emergency loan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  The emergency assistance project will support the reconstruction or upgrading of about 3,500 kilometers of rural roads in \nSichuan  Province  and  about  317  kilometers  of  rural  roads  and  12  schools  in  Shaanxi  Province.  The  loan  will  alleviate  the \ntransport problems caused by the earthquake and will improve the quality of the schools, which will indirectly facilitate poverty \nreduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General invention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Wenchuan earthquake brought immense suffering to many rural and poor households that were not prepared to deal with \nthe disaster and the reconstruction efforts. The population of the 23 project counties is 12.1 million, 77% of whom are rural; \nmany  are  below  the  government  poverty  line.  Of  the  23  project  counties,  8  (6  In  Sichuan  and  2  in  Shaanxi)  are  national \npoverty counties. Rural poverty results from remote and isolated locations, and a lack of access to transport, good farmland, \ngood schools, and a water supply. \n \n2.  Design Features  \nReconstruction or Rehabilitation of Road in Affected Counties and Townships. In Sichuan, the rural road reconstruction \nand rehabilitation will directly benefit about 5.0 million residents in 19 affected counties; three-quarters of whom are rural, and \none-third of whom are poor. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of rural roads in Shaanxi will benefit about 600,000 people, \nthree-quarters  of  whom  are  rural  and  one-third  of  whom  are  poor.  Improved  availability  of  reliable  transport  to  markets  will \nstimulate cash crop farming in remote or isolated areas, and broaden access to off-farm employment opportunities. Failure to \nreconstruct or upgrade rural roads will result in rural people in the remote parts of the project area having less mobility; they \nwill  consequently  face  greater  difficulties  in  restoring  their  livelihoods  after  the  earthquake,  and  poor  households  in  those \nregions will not be able to benefit from the broader economic development. \nReconstruct and Improve Schools in Affected Towns and Villages. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Project will focus \non reconstruction and improvements for 12 model schools, including six junior secondary and six primary schools. These will \nbring immediate benefits to the schools\u2019 16,800 students (including more than 8,000 female students), and long-term benefits \nto future students among the 460,000 residents of the area serviced by the schools, about 40% of whom are from rural areas \nof these remote counties. Two of the three project areas are poverty counties. \nCreate Employment Opportunity under the Project. It is estimated that 115,000 unskilled workers from the local areas will \nbe  required  for  an  average  of  6  months  of  labor  during  the  reconstruction  of  the  rural  roads  and  schools.  Each  worker  is \nestimated to earn CNY1,000 per month, with a total income benefit of CNY690 million. \n \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe  Wenchuan  earthquake  brought  immense  suffering  to  many  rural  and  urban  people  in  Sichuan,  Shaanxi,  and  Gansu \nprovinces. Therefore, the government program has set three priorities for reconstruction: (i) housing, schools, and hospitals; \n(ii)  rural  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  public  buildings.  There  are  669  towns/townships  and  7,573  administrative  villages  that  will \nbenefit  directly  from  the  proposed  reconstruction  activities.  The  ADB  emergency  loan  assistance  is  part  of  a  much  larger \nreconstruction  program  that  is  designed  to  restore  and  improve  the  people\u2019s  living  conditions  and  livelihoods.  The \nimplementation  is  coordinated  by  leading  groups  to  ensure  the  investments  are  channeled  through  local  governments,  and \nprojects are implemented in an efficient and effective manner to benefit the affected persons (APs). \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n55\n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThis is an emergency assistance and the proposed reconstruction of roads and schools is a priority for the APs and the local \ngovernments. A damage and needs assessment has been conducted based on investigations with all key stakeholders. ADB \nfielded  a  reconnaissance  and  fact-finding  mission  and  extensive  consultations  were  held  with  local  governments,  APs, \ntransport users, and school teachers and children. The ADB loan is part of a larger reconstruction effort; planning has been \ncoordinated with the various stakeholders for the benefit of the APs. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  Government  has  taken  the  lead  role  in  the  relief  and  reconstruction  efforts,  but  the  involvement  of  the  local  people  is \nessential for successful rehabilitation. Although many APs are still working to restore their living conditions and livelihoods, if \nwilling they can participate in the reconstruction of the rural roads and schools. However, most APs expect the government to \nrestore the roads and schools as quickly as possible. \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n \nThe proposed Emergency Assistance for Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction Project \n1. \nwill  support  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  the  areas  affected  by  the  Wenchuan \nearthquake, which caused extensive damages in 39 counties of Sichuan Province, four counties \nof  Shaanxi  Province,  and  eight  counties  of  Gansu  Province.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  will  assist  the  reconstruction  and  upgrading  of  (i)  rural  roads  in  19  counties  of  Sichuan \nProvince;  and  (ii)  rural  roads,  bridges,  and  schools  in  four  counties  of  Shaanxi  Province.  The \nreconstruction and upgrading works will be implemented over 3 years, from 2009 to 2011. \n \nIn  Sichuan,  about  3,500  kilometers  of  rural  roads  have  been  identified  by  the  country \n2. \ntransport  bureaus  and  approved  by  the  Sichuan  Provincial  Highway  Administration  Bureau, \nunder  the  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department.  All  are  existing  roads  which  were \ndamaged by the Wenchuan earthquake; they will be reconstructed and some will be upgraded \nfollowing  the  original  alignment.  Some  road  sections  will  also  require  new  bridges,  and  the \nstandards and alignments for these may be modified slightly. Therefore, although the selection \ncriteria  includes  avoiding  those  road  sections  with  land  acquisition,  there  could  still  be  some \nsmall amounts of land acquisition and possibly some house demolition. \n \n3. \nIn  Shaanxi,  317  kilometers  of  rural  roads  have  been  identified  by  the  county  transport \nbureaus  and  approved  by  the  Shaanxi  Provincial  Highway  Administration  Bureau  for \nreconstruction. All are existing roads that were damaged by the Wenchuan earthquake; they will \nbe reconstructed and some will be upgraded following the original alignment. Some new bridges \nwill be constructed to connect the existing roads. The feasibility studies indicate that two road \nsubprojects  and  two  bridge  subprojects  will  require  some  land  acquisition  and  possibly  some \nhouse  demolition.  In  addition,  12  schools  in  Shaanxi  have  been  identified  by  the  county \neducation  bureaus  for  complete  or  partial  reconstruction  and  improvement.  Most  of  the \neducation subprojects will require no land or very small amounts of land (with the exception of \ntwo schools, for which due diligence will be conducted and reported by an independent expert). \n \n4. \nA resettlement framework has been formulated to address potential land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts caused by the project activities. The total number of affected persons (APs) \nis  not  known  at  this  time,  but  few  if  any  structures  will  need  to  be  demolished.  At  most,  small \nstrips  of  land  may  be  required  for  road  widening  or  straightening,  or  for  bridge  construction. \nThese  impacts  will  be  measured,  recorded  and  reported  in  the  subproject  resettlement  plans. \nSince  land  acquisition  is  very  minor,  there  will  be  no  significant  impacts  on  the  livelihoods  of \nAPs.  Therefore,  cash  compensation  based  on  replacement  value  will  be  adequate  to  address \nthe small losses.  \n \n5. \nSubprojects are being selected by the implementing agencies (IAs) and approved by the \nexecuting  agencies  (EAs),  based  on  selection  criteria  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  The  IAs  will  do \ntheir  best  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  In  Sichuan,  further \nscreening  of  subprojects  for  resettlement  due  diligence  will  be  conducted  by  an  external \nresettlement  monitor/expert.  Based  on  this  due  diligence,  the  total  number  of  subprojects  that \nrequire  short  resettlement  plans  can  be  determined.  In  Shaanxi,  four  transport  subprojects \n(Hanjiang  Bridge  in  Mian  Xian  County,  the  two  class  III  roads  in  Ningqiang  County,  and \nShiyangmiao  Qianhe  Bridge  in  Chencang  District)  will  have  some  land  acquisition.  Short \nresettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  by  the  IAs  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works  for  those  subprojects  that  have  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. \n \n6. \nFor  school  reconstruction,  Gou  Town  No.  1  Middle  School  involves  40  mu  of  vacant \nconstruction  land  and  Chencang  Experimental  Primary  School  has  already  acquired  40  mu  of \nfarmland.  Therefore,  a  due  diligence  report  needs  to  be  prepared  by  the  IA  for  these  two \nschools and submitted to ADB for review; if there are any remaining issues, a retrofit plan will be \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nprepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence.  The  due  diligence  report  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB by 31 March 2009, covering the Chencang Primary School, and the Gouzhen \nMiddle School. \n \n7. \nFor people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China Land Administration Law \n(1998) and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The EAs will ensure that any people \nlosing  land,  housing,  other  assets  or  income  sources  will  be  assisted  to  fully  restore  their \nincome  and  living  standards.  Those  people  losing  land  temporarily  during  construction  will \nreceive  a  payment  equivalent  to  production  value  foregone  for  the  period  of  loss,  which  is \nexpected to be 2 years, and land will also be restored by the contractor to the original condition. \n \n8. \nIf  any  structures  need  to  be  demolished,  replacement  value  will  be  provided  to  the \naffected rural households based on compensation rates adopted in each county. Those losing \nhousing will be able to acquire new housing sites close to a road, electricity and water services \nwithin  the  current  village  group  or  administrative  village.  There  will  be  no  reduction  in  house \ncompensation for depreciation, and people can salvage materials from their old houses. \n \nThe total cost of land acquisition and resettlement has not yet been finalized, but these \n9. \ncosts are included in the subproject costs estimates. The source of funding for land acquisition \nand  resettlement  will  be  entirely  financed  by  local  governments.  During  project  construction, if \nthere  are  significant  material  changes  in  project  scope  or  other  causes,  a  new  or  an  updated \nresettlement plan will prepared, disclosed to APs and submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to \nimplementation of such changes. \n \n10. \nThe  county  communications  bureaus  or  the  county  education  bureaus  will  be \nresponsible  for  planning  and  implementing  project  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  any \nrelated  resettlement  management  work.  The  county  land  and  resources  bureaus  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  procedures,  agreements  and  payments. \nThey will (i) issue formal notifications to APs; (ii) complete the formal land transfer procedures in \na \nland  acquisition, \ncompensation  and  resettlement;  and  (iv)  ensure  land  used  temporarily  is  returned  to  original \nuser and restored by the contractors to the original or improved condition.  \n \n11. \nresettlement  plans  and  subsequent \nimplementation, the relevant authorities will consult with and encourage the participation of the \nAPs. Also, resettlement plans must be disclosed to affected villages and individual APs prior to \nsubmission  to  ADB.  The  resettlement  plans  should  be  placed  in  the  local  government  and \nvillage offices and made publicly available. The resettlement plans will also be posted on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \nif  any  APs  are  dissatisfied  with  compensation, \n12. \nconstruction  arrangements  or  other  matters,  they  can  make  their  complaints  to  the  relevant \ndepartment.  The  process  and  results  of  grievance  redress  will  be  recorded,  monitored,  and \nevaluated by the relevant IAs. If necessary, further follow-up measures will be taken to ensure \nthat the problems will be resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. \n \n13. \nThe requirements for internal and external monitoring and evaluation are included in the \nresettlement  framework.  The  internal  monitoring  is  to  (i)  maintain  supervision  of  resettlement \nimplementation, (ii) check that the project can be constructed smoothly, and (iii) ensure the APs\u2019 \nentitlements  are  provided  as  per  regulations  and  in  a  timely  manner.  The  EAs  will  engage  a \nqualified domestic monitor to carry out independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation. The \nmonitor  will  conduct  investigations  during  resettlement  and  prepare  annual  monitoring  reports \nuntil  the  completion  of  the  Project.  The  first  monitoring  and  evaluation  report  will  be  due  31 \nDecember 2009. \n\ntimely  manner;  (iii)  document  and  resolve  grievances  relating \n\nthe  process  of \n\nimplementation, \n\nDuring  project \n\nformulating \n\nDuring \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n59\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nthe  Environmental \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) report aims to describe the project rural road \nand bridge and school components, assess their environmental impacts, and provide mitigation \nmeasures for the environmental impacts. This report summarizes 23 IEEs prepared by project \ncounties as part of the domestic environmental impact assessment procedure. The IEEs were \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Disaster  and  Emergency \nAssistance  Policy1 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  will  be  approved  by  provincial \nenvironmental  protection  departments \nImpact \nAssessment Law (2002) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and its related regulations.  \n \nThe  Emergency  Assistance  for  Wenchuan  Earthquake  Reconstruction  Project  is \n2. \ncategorized  as  environment  category  B.  Given  the  nature  of  the  physical  works  (i.e., \nreconstruction  of  damaged  roads  and  bridges  and  school  buildings),  the  potential  negative \nimpacts are localized and short-term, and can be mitigated. Therefore, an environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) is not required.  \n \n3. \nBecause of the Project\u2019s emergency assistance nature, a few IEEs of project rural roads \nhave not yet been finalized. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has \nbeen  prepared  for  those  rural  road  components  to  be  selected  during  project  implementation. \nThe  relevant  county  communication  bureau  will  carry  out  an  environmental  assessment  in \naccordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  assessment  laws  and  regulations,  and  will  prepare \nan  IEE.2 If  the  EARF  determines  that  a  full  EIA  is  required  for  a  new  road  section, the  county \ncommunication bureau will prepare an EIA report, and ADB will finance the road section after its \nEIA  report  concurrence.  The  environmental  impact  of  school  building  reconstruction  is \ninsignificant if the school buildings are reconstructed in the original school yard and the adjacent \nresidential area, and therefore the need for a full EIA is unlikely for that component. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  physical  component  consists  of  reconstruction  of  damaged  roads  and \n4. \nschool buildings in 23 counties in Sichuan (19 counties) and Shaanxi (four counties) provinces. \nThe technical standard of the rural roads is classes II\u2013IV. The road reconstruction will be carried \nout  strictly  in  the  existing  right-of-way,  except  for  bridge  reconstruction.  Some  roads  include \ndamaged bridge reconstruction. The school buildings will be reconstructed in the existing school \nyards and adjacent lots. \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nMeteorology \n\n1. \n \n5. \nThe  project  area  is  located  in  the  mid-west  of  the  PRC  in  four  separate  mountainous \nareas: in the north of Sichuan Basin (Guangyuan, Bazhong, and Nanchong prefectures), in the \nwest  of  Sichuan  Basin  (Chengdu  and  Yaan  prefectures),  in  the  west  of  Hanzhong  Basin \n(Hanzhong prefecture), and in the west of Guangzhong Plain (Baoji prefecture). The Qinghai\u2013\nTibet Plateau has a continental monsoon climate in winter, when it is influenced by cold, dry air \nfrom  the  northwest.  In  summer,  the  oceanic  monsoon  brings  warm  and  humid  air  from \nsoutheast  and  southwest;  it  is  wet,  often  with  heavy  rains  and  storms.  The  annual  average \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n2  If a new section\u2019s environmental impacts are significant, a full environmental impact assessment will be carried out \n\naccording to EARF. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nrainfall  is  1,000\u20132,000  millimeters,  80%\u201390%  of  which  falls  from  May  to  October.  The  intense \nprecipitation  between  May  and  October  was  a  concern  after  the  earthquake,  as  heavy  storms \nincrease the risk of siltation, erosion, slope slippage, and mudflows.  \n\nProtected Areas \n\n \n2. \n \nThere  are  12  nature  reserves  in  Sichuan\u2019s  project  counties3 and  one  nature  reserve  in \n6. \nShaanxi\u2019s  project  counties. 4  None  of  the  Project\u2019s  rural  roads  are  located  near  the  nature \nreserve boundaries; the distance between the roads and boundaries is at least 8 km. \n \n\n3. \n\nLand Use and Cultural Resources \n\nInstitutional Arrangement \n\nThe  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  and \n\nThe  project  area  has  a  long  history  dating  from  the  Neolithic  period.  Therefore,  the \n\n \n7. \nMost  land  use  around  the  roads  is  nonagricultural,  including  secondary  forests,  steep \nmountain  terrain,  and  some  marginal  grazing  land.  Cultivated  land  includes  land  containing \nvegetables, corn, wheat, buckwheat, orchards, and paddy lands. School reconstruction sites are \nlocated in residential area or urban business districts.  \n \n8. \npossibility of encountering unknown cultural relics during civil works exists.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nthe  communication \ndepartments of Hanzhong and Baoji cities are responsible for overall environmental protection \nduring rural road reconstruction. The provincial highway bureaus are responsible for supervising \nthe  rural  road  reconstruction-related  activities  of  the  county  communications  bureaus.  The \ncounty  communications  bureaus  have  prepared  environmental  impact  registration  tables \n(EIRTs) or environmental impact assessment reports (EIARs) by hiring accredited consultants, \nin  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Law.  IEEs  have  been \nprepared on the basis of the EIRTs and EIARs, and include an environmental management plan \n(EMP). Civil works will be carried out by the civil works contractors. The technical specifications \nof the contracts will (i) include environmental protection measures described in the EMPs, and \ntheir cost; and (ii) will ensure that all environmental protection measures will be carried out by \nthe  civil  works  contractors.  The  project  implementation  agencies  (IAs)  will  supervise  the  civil \nworks by hiring construction supervision consultants.  \n \nThe  Hanzhong  and  Baoji  city  education  departments  are  responsible  for  overall \n10. \nenvironmental  protection  of  school  building  reconstruction.  They  will  supervise  the  school \nbuilding  reconstruction  activities  of  county  education  bureaus,  which  have  prepared  EIRTs  for \nschool  reconstruction.  The  county  education  bureaus  will  hire  consulting  firms  for  school \nbuilding  design,  which  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  building  codes  and \nregulations for environmental protection, such as regulations on sewage treatment. The contract \ntechnical specifications for building construction will include environmental protection measures, \nand the contracts will include the environmental protection cost. County education bureaus will \nsupervise the construction works by hiring construction supervision consultants. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Heshuihe  Nature  Reserve  in  Dayi  County,  Cuiyunlanggubai  Nature  Reserve  Yuanba  District,  Suimagou  Nature \nReserve in Chaotian District, Micangshan Nature Reserve in Wangcang County, Tiancaibanzhulin Nature Reserve \nin  Cangxi  County,  Gouxihe  Nature  Reserve  in  Liangzhong  City,  Lizhuping  Nature  Reserve  in  Shimian  County, \nFengtongzhai Nature Reserve in Baoxing County, Baoxinghe Nature Reserve in Baoxing County, Noshuihe Nature \nReserve  in  Tongjiang  County,  Guangwushan  Nature  Reserve  in  Nanjiang  County,  and  Dashaolangou  Nature \nReserve in Nanjiang County. \n\n4  Baofeng Nature Reserve in Lueyang County. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n61\n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework \n\nE. \n \n11.  When  new  rural  road  and  bridge  or  new  school  building  reconstruction  is  planned,  an \ninitial  environmental  screening  will  determine  the  need  for  a  full  EIA  report  under  the  PRC\u2019s \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Law and the EARF. The county communications bureaus will \ncarry out environmental screening for each road and bridge reconstruction under the supervision \nof  the  provincial  highway  bureau;  the  county  education  bureau  will  carry  out  environmental \nscreening  for  school  reconstruction  under  the  supervision  of  city  education  bureau.  If  the \nscreening  identifies  any  potential  significant  environmental  impacts  related  to  reconstruction,  a \nfull EIA report for the component will be prepared and approved before the reconstruction works \nbegin. For road and bridge reconstruction without significant environmental impacts, an EIRT will \nbe  prepared  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s  regulations.  Potential  environmental  impacts  can  be \nconsidered significant and full a EIA is required if one of the following four conditions applies:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nany endangered species are found in the environmental impact area (requires a \nfull EIA for the species and its ecosystem);  \nany  protected  area,  such  as  a  nature  or  water  reserve,  exists  in  the \nenvironmental impact area (requires an EIA for the reserves); \nlarge-scale earthworks are required near rivers meeting class I or II water quality \nstandards; or  \nlarge-scale  earthworks  are  required  near  any  other  sensitive  sites,  such  as \nhospitals, schools, or residential areas.  \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and their Mitigation Measures \n\n \nF. \n \n12. \nRural  road  and  bridge  reconstruction  activities  mainly  include  debris  removal  on  the \ndamaged  sections,  damaged  pavement  removal,  embankment  restoration,  new  retaining  wall \ninstallation,  new  slope  protection  installation,  subgrade  restoration,  drainage  installation,  and \npavement. Most works will be carried out by hand. Use of large construction machines such as \npower shovels and dump tracks will be limited due to the nature of the rural roads. The major \npotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  from  road  reconstruction  are  (i)  water  pollution,  (ii) \nnoise to sensitive receptors, and (iii) air pollution from construction machines.  \n \n13.  Water pollution will be avoided by (i) adequate installation of temporary drainage during \nconstruction,  (ii)  proper  maintenance  of  construction  machines  and  equipment  to  prevent  oil \nleaks,  and  (iii)  installation  of  sediment  ponds  at  water  discharge  points.  Noise  to  sensitive \nreceptors  will  be  alleviated  by  (i)  the  use  of  low-noise  machinery,  and  (ii)  appropriate \nconstruction  scheduling.  The  adverse  impacts  of  air  pollution  from  construction  machinery  will \nbe avoided through adequate maintenance.  \n \nDuring the road reconstruction, there is a potential risk of encountering unknown cultural \n14. \nrelics.  If  cultural  relics  are  unearthed,  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s  laws  and  regulations,  the  civil \nworks will be immediately suspended and will be resumed only after authorized specialists from \nthe Cultural Bureau have undertaken an archaeological investigation.  \n \n15. \nFollowing completion of construction, the roads will be mainly used by the villagers living \nalong  them,  making  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  road  traffic  unlikely. \nImproved slope protection and drainage systems will reduce soil erosion along the roads, which \nhas been a serious environmental issue after the earthquake.  \n \n16. \nSchool  building  reconstruction  will  follow  normal  building  construction  techniques.  The \nuse  of  large  construction  machines  will  be  very  limited.  Some  relatively  large  buildings  (three \nstories  or  higher)  may  require  cranes.  The  major  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nDuring \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring \n\nschool  building  construction  are  pollution  of  water  as  a  result  of  construction  activities,  and \ndisruption of school activities due to noise.  \n \n17. \nPollution of water as a result of construction site activities will be avoided by the use of \nan adequate sewage system during construction. If the existing sewage system is insufficient or \ninadequate  to  treat  the  increased  amount  of  polluted  water  during  construction,  a  temporary \nwater treatment system will be installed.  \n \n18. \nThe nature of school building reconstruction work means that general annoyances such \nas  noise  associated  with  construction  works  may  be  inevitable.  However,  the  disturbance  to \nschool  activities  will  be  minimized  through  coordination  between  the  construction  and  school \nmanagement. The contractors will plan their detailed construction activity by consulting with the \nschool management to allow educational activities to be carried out without serious disruption. \nThe  construction  contract  documents  will  include  provisions  relating  to  consultations  and \nplanning of construction activities.  \n \nG. \n \n19. \nthe  construction,  compliance  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  county \ncommunication  bureaus  and  education  bureaus.  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment  will  hire  environmental  supervision  consultants  as  part  of  the  construction \nsupervision  to  carry  out  environmental  monitoring  during  the  construction.  In  Shaanxi,  the \ngovernments  of  Baoji  City  and  Hanzhong  City  will  hire  environmental  supervision  consultants. \nThe consultants will visit construction sites and monitor general construction quality in terms of \nenvironmental protection. The consultants will submit semiannual environmental reports to the \nEA, which will be forwarded to ADB.  \n \nH. \n \n20. \nThe  county  communications  bureaus  and  education  bureaus  have  carried  out  public \nconsultations  during  the  planning  of  road  and  school  building  reconstruction.  The  EIRTs  and \nEIARs have been made accessible to concerned people in the county government offices.  \n \nI. \n \n21. \nThe  Project\u2019s  physical  components  are  reconstruction  of  damaged  roads,  bridges  and \nschools.  Only  minor  and  short-term  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated, \nprovided that the PRC\u2019s laws and regulations are observed, IEEs are prepared, and the EMPs \ncontained  in  the  IEEs  are  carried  out.  The  impacts  are  considered  to  be  controllable  through \nproper  implementation  and  supervision  arrangements.  The  major  environmental  protection-\nrelated  risk  is  through  inadequate  civil  works  management.  This  will  be  avoided  by  including \nenvironmental  protection  measures \nthe \nimplementation of civil works through the use of construction supervision consultants.   \n \nIn  summary,  the  IEEs  for  the  Project  show  that  no  significant  adverse  environmental \n22. \nimpacts are expected to result from the proposed reconstruction works.
