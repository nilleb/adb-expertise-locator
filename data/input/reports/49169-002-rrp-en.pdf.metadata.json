The report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the \nGreen Climate Fund (GCF), and (ii) the proposed administration of grants to be provided by the \nGCF  and  High-Level  Technology  Fund  (HLTF)1 for  the  project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the GCF loan, GCF grant, and HLTF grant. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  deliver  sustainable  and  comprehensive  solutions  to  transform  the \nsubstandard, climate-vulnerable, and heavily polluting ger areas (paras. 3\u20134) of Ulaanbaatar city \ninto affordable, low carbon, climate-resilient, and livable eco-districts. It will leverage private sector \ninvestment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units;2  and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares \n(ha) of ger areas into eco-districts.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nFollowing  the  transition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-based  economy  in  1991, \n3. \nMongolia  has  experienced  rapid  rural\u2013urban  migration,  mainly  caused  by  (i)  extreme  climate \nevents,  such  as  droughts  and  severe  winter  conditions  (dzud),  combined  with  poor  veterinary \nservices  and  livestock  management;  and  (ii)  adoption  in  2003  of  a  policy  giving  each  citizen \naccess to about 700 square meters (m2) of urban land.4 Inadequate infrastructure investments, \nhousing policies, and urban planning regulations to accommodate the migrant population led to \nthe formation of vast peri-urban areas, named ger areas after the Mongolian yurts (gers) around \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s central districts.5 In 2017, the population of ger areas was estimated at 850,000 \npeople, that is 60% of the city\u2019s population of 1.46 million, and 30% of the country\u2019s population. \n \n4. \nGer areas are settlements of low- and middle-income households characterized by loosely \naligned plots, with irregular and unpaved pathways. Dwellings in ger areas are unserved detached \nsolid  houses  and  gers, 6  poorly  insulated,  using  inefficient  coal  and  biomass-fired  stoves \ngenerating large amounts of carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution, especially during winter.7 \nMost  households  have  land  tenure.  Poor  sanitation,  with  most  households  relying  on  open  pit \nlatrines, coupled with poor solid waste collection create unsanitary living conditions. Residents \nhave limited access to water, which is being supplied via water kiosks, and access to public space \n\n                                                 \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  Green housing maximizes climate (i) mitigation measures through the use of resource- and energy-efficient building \ntechnique  and  materials,  renewable  energy  systems,  and  operation  and  maintenance  to  maintain  building \nperformance and occupational health; and (ii) adaptation measures to reduce the vulnerability of ger area residents \nto harsh winters, flood events, hot summers, and soil pollution. \n\n3  Eco-district development is a highly integrated urban planning and development process at the neighborhood level, \n\nusing local responses to build green and sustainable development throughout the city. \n\n4  Average land plots measure 500 m2. In January 2017, the mayor issued an order to restrict the access of rural people \n\nwithout official permits to urban areas. In December 2017, the policy was extended until January 2020. \n\n5  The central districts of Ulaanbaatar are formed by apartment blocks with comprehensive utility services, including \n\ndedicated district heating, piped water supply, and wastewater collection and treatment services. \n\n6  Of the ger area population, 56% lives in solid houses and 44% in traditional gers. \n7  Air pollution causes health problems such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. World Bank. 2011. Air Quality \n\nAnalysis of Ulaanbaatar: Improving Air Quality to Reduce Health Impacts. Washington DC.  \n\n \n\n\fand facilities, commercial areas, and economic amenities is lacking. 8 This situation (i) makes ger \nareas  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts  and    intensifies  their  carbon  emissions;  (ii) \nincreases  the  cost  of  doing  business,  discourages  investors  and  developers,  and  inhibits  both \neconomic integration and urban redevelopment processes; and (iii) affects vulnerable groups\u2014\nmostly women, children, elderly, and disadvantaged persons. Incremental growth and migration \nare increasing the population living in these poor conditions, because affordable housing options \nfor low- and middle-income households are limited. A 2016 survey by the Capital City Housing \nCorporation estimated housing demand at 150,000 units, while available affordable housing stock \nis  about  4,000  units;  with  60%  of  ger  areas  residents  willing  to  move  to  apartment  units  if \nacceptable and affordable solutions are proposed.9 \n \n5. \nIn 1997, the Government of Mongolia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) developed \na legal and policy framework for the housing sector. Under the National Housing Strategy, housing \npolicies were made demand-driven with new standards and regulations.10 In 2002, ADB approved \nthe  first  housing  finance  project,  which  introduced  long-term  mortgage  lending  to  the  banking \nsystem.11 In 2006, the Mongolian Mortgage Corporation was set up to create a pool of long-term \nfunds to stimulate a secondary mortgage market. Housing finance expanded from 2013 through \nthe government\u2019s 8% mortgage program. However, stringent mortgage access conditions and a \nlack of housing products for low-income households meant the mortgage program mainly served \nthe  upper  middle-income  households,  creating  an  oversupply  of  high-end  market  housing \nproducts. The program is currently suspended. Recently, the government and the Municipality of \nUlaanbaatar (MUB) initiated a series of programs to increase the supply of affordable housing \nunits, and support ger area redevelopment.12 The objective is to deliver up to 130,000 housing \nunits through the redevelopment of ger areas and the development of new areas. However, a lack \nof  viable  solutions,  infrastructure  investment,  financing  support  to  developers,  and  sustainable \nhousing \ninto \nimplementable  plans.  The  few  residential  blocks  that  were  initiated  focused  on  lowering \nconstruction costs, to the detriment of community well-being and sustainable urban planning, and \nlacked energy-efficient and renewable energy features. \n \n6. \nThrough  the  ADB-financed  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas  Development \nInvestment  Program,  MUB  is  extending  basic  urban  and  social  services  to  upgrade  economic \nhubs or subcenters in ger areas and provide an enabling environment for urban redevelopment \nand private and public investments.13 This provides an opportunity to implement onsite solutions \nfor households to access apartments within their communities by integrating housing solutions \n\nfinancing  mechanisms  have  resulted \n\nthese  programs  not  developing \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n8  Water consumption in ger areas is about 10 liters per capita per day, about half the minimum recommended by the \n\nWorld Health Organization in similar contexts. The cost is 2\u201310 times more than for residents of other areas. \n\n9  For medium and low income households, housing costs are considered affordable if rent or mortgage payments and \nutilities fees) is within 30% of gross monthly income. Affordability and willingness to pay of households below the \nseventh income decile are estimated at about MNT1.2 million ($490) per m2 for a 35 m2 apartment, while average \nmarket price was about MNT2.6 million ($1,070) per m2, based on the December 2017 currency exchange rate. \n10 In  1999,  the  government  approved  the  Housing Law,  National  Housing  Strategy,  Housing  Privatization  Law,  and \n\nCondominium Law. \n\n11 ADB. Mongolia: Housing Finance (Sector) Project. The project allowed the establishment of a market-based housing \n\nfinance system in Mongolia and the first mortgage finance law approved by the Parliament. \n\n12 MUB is also known as the Governor\u2019s Office of the Capital City Ulaanbaatar. Government initiatives included the (i) \nestablishment  on  6  July  2013  of  the  State  Housing  Corporation,  which  was  tasked  with  implementing  40,000 \naffordable housing units nationwide; and (ii) Rental Housing Program, approved by the Cabinet on 18 June 2015. \nMUB\u2019s main initiatives are the (i) City Housing Program, approved by Resolution 17/17 of the city council in 2014; (ii) \nAffordable  Housing  Strategy for  Ulaanbaatar,  approved  on 28  May  2015  by  the  city  council;  and  (iii)  Capital  City \nHousing Corporation, established in August 2015. \n\n13 ADB.

In addition, in November 2017 the government issued a resolution \nordering the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) to establish the first green development fund \nto promote green urban development and economy, making DBM a key partner to leverage the \nprivate  sector  for  green  housing  finance. 14  International  housing  projects  and  Ulaanbaatar \nhousing  and  redevelopment  experience  show  that  a  complete  solution\u2014integrating  housing, \ninfrastructure, urban development, and financing support to both the supply and demand sides\u2014\nis the best way to create a paradigm shift to improve access to green affordable housing, and \nresilient and low-carbon urban development.15  \n \nB. \n \nImpacts  and  outcome. 16  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  living \n7. \nconditions in Mongolia improved; and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient \nto climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents.17 The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable \nhousing  in  Ulaanbaatar  ger  areas  increased.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, \nand inclusive cities of ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan.18 \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and \nsocial housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component);19 (ii) long-term financing \nto developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in \nger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] \ncomponent); and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will \ndeliver  (i)  green  social  housing  units  with  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation  features;  and \n(ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million \nof  the  GCF  loan  will  be  made  available  under  the  proposed  FIL  to  enable  an  eco-district  and \naffordable  housing  fund  (EDAF)  to  provide  long-term  debt  financing  (denominated  in  local \ncurrency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers\u2019 participation in the low-\ncarbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project \nimplementation;  (ii)  eco-district  feasibility  and  development,  policy  improvement  on  climate \nchange adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing \nunits; (iii) detailed design and supervision; and (iv) sustainable green housing finance.20 \n                                                 \n14 Based on the resolution, the Asset Management Company of the DBM (AMC-DBM) was tasked to manage the fund. \n15 Lessons were mainly derived from the following projects: (i) Mexican programs of Hipoteca Verde (green mortgage) \nand EcoCasa that provided low interest loans to developers for eco-affordable housing, (ii) Singapore\u2019s public\u2013private \npartnership design on a build-and-sell scheme, (iii) Thailand\u2019s Baan Eua-Arthorn project, (iv) Hong Kong\u2019s public \nhousing program, and (v) ADB\u2019s sector project to develop poor communities in the Philippines.

The  project  eco-districts  will  be  low-carbon,  climate-resilient, \n9. \nmixed-income,  and  mixed-use  areas  with  approximately  30%  public  space.  The  project\u2019s  five \nphases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. \nPhase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases \n2\u20133  will  have  8  subprojects  (40  ha),  and  phases  4\u20135  will  have  10  subprojects  (50  ha).  Each \nsubproject should be completed within 5 years.21 Phases 2\u20135 will identify and prepare a batch of \nsubprojects  to  be  appraised  based  on  eligibility  and  selection  criteria,  including  financial  and \nphysical parameters, formulated from the feasibility study of the two core subprojects.22 A detailed \ninfrastructure and architectural design produced for each subproject will ensure (i) adequate ratio \nfor  social  (15%),  affordable  (55%),  and  market  rate  (30%)  housing  units;  (ii)  balance  between \npublic  space  and  amenities,  commercial  areas,  and  residential  units;  and  (iii)  financial  viability \nand  rentability  to  allow  private  sector  participation.  The  redevelopment  process  and  housing \nconstruction will be undertaken onsite, and will be demand-driven. \n \n10. \nSector lending with financial  intermediation  loan  component modality. The  sector \nlending  modality  was  deemed  the  most  appropriate  modality  to  achieve  the  project  objectives \nbecause (i) a large number of subprojects in the sector are to be financed; (ii) the government \nand MUB have sector development plans (SDPs) to ensure the priority development needs of the \ncross sectoral policy improvement plan are met, and to guide project implementation; (iii) sector \nand institutional capacity analyses23 have shown that the government and MUB have adequate \ninstitutional capacity to implement the SDPs and the project; and (iv) policies applicable to the \nsector are deemed appropriate and will be improved, if warranted (paras. 5\u20136). The project will \nsupport the government and MUB in translating their SDPs into implementable investments, and \ncoordinated policies, actions, and institutional improvement.24   \n \n11. \nFinancial and institutional arrangements will facilitate the application of a blended finance \nstrategy  using  the  FIL  modality.  The  FIL  modality  will  leverage  private  resources  through  the \nEDAF to be established and managed by the Asset Management Company of DBM (AMC-DBM) \non behalf of the Ministry of Finance.25 The EDAF will be established as a private investment fund \nstructured as a revolving fund, and will be used to onlend a portion of the GCF loan to participating \ncommercial banks. Based on eligibility and selection criteria, commercial banks will use the GCF \nloan  proceeds  to  support  housing  supply  and  demand:  (i)  for  supply,  the  EDAF  will  provide \nmedium-term loans to selected private developers, which will be combined with the developers\u2019 \nequities and additional loans by DBM and participating commercial banks to implement output 2; \nand  (ii)  for  demand,  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  converted  into  low-cost  long-term  mortgages  to \nhome buyers for purchases of the affordable housing and market rate housing units. \n \nD. \n \n12. \n                                                 \n21 The phased approach will allow project parameters to be adjusted based on socioeconomic changes. \n22 Subproject eligibility and selection criteria are in para. 30 of the Project Administration Manual (PAM) (accessible \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $570.1 million.

For  the  investment  loan  component,  the \n13. \ngovernment has requested (i) a concessional loan of $20 million; and (ii) a regular loan of $60 \nmillion, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the project. The concessional \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per \nyear during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The regular loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in \nthe  loan  and  project  agreements.  Based  on  the  straight  line  repayment  method,  the  average \nmaturity is 15.25 years. The government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loans to MUB on \nterms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB,  which  will  be  combined  with  a  $35  million  MUB \ncounterpart fund to finance output 1 and a portion of output 3, i.e., project management support \nand  detailed  design.  MUB  will  finance  35.5%  of  taxes  and  duties  through  exemptions,  or  will \nprovide  funds  to  pay  such  taxes  and  duties  in  accordance  with  relevant  laws  and  regulations. \nHLTF  will  provide  a  $3  million  grant  to  finance  a  smart  renewable  energy  and  building \nperformance control and monitoring system. The GCF will provide grant cofinancing equivalent \nto $50 million and loan cofinancing equivalent to $95 million, to be administered by ADB as an \naccredited entity. The GCF loan will have a 40-year term, including a 10-year grace period, annual \nprincipal repayments from year 11 to year 20 equivalent to 2% of the initial principal, and from \nyear 21 to year 40 equivalent to 4%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nGCF  loan  agreement.

AMC-DBM will manage the EDAF, which will serve \nas the apex financial institution for the project funds to be channeled to financial intermediaries.27 \nIt is estimated that GCF loan proceeds, reforms in green finance under the project, will lead to \nDBM and other participating commercial banks to contribute $111.4 million, developers to finance \n$131.8 million in the form of equity participation, and beneficiaries to contribute $63.9 million from \ntheir own resources. Moreover, about $30.3 million of the GCF grant will be passed on to MUB to \nprovide performance-based grants through a green building facility to qualified private developers \nfor  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  features.  Climate  mitigation  is  estimated  to  cost \n$81.7 million and climate adaptation is estimated to cost $146.6 million. ADB will finance 30.6% \nof mitigation costs and 37.5% of adaptation costs.

The specifications applied to eco-district design will match the principles of \nenergy and resource conservation and promotion of renewable energy best practices. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  project  is  economically  viable.  The  resulting  base-case  economic  internal  rates  of \nreturn of the core subprojects are 11.26% to 15.53%, exceeding the ADB prescribed minimum \ndiscount  rate  of  9%,  confirming  they  are  economically  robust,  with  anticipated  economic  and \nhealth benefits arising from reduced environmental pollution that exceed the estimated economic \ncosts.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  subprojects  will  remain  economically  viable  under \nvarious  scenarios.  A  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  viability  of  the  revenue-\ngenerating  core  subprojects  to  be  financed  using  the  GCF  grant  and  loan  proceeds  under \noutput 2.  The  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  from  the  developer\u2019s  perspective.  Financial \nrevenues were derived from the sale of affordable housing and market rate housing units, as well \nas  the  sale  of  parking  spaces  and  commercial  lots  for  shops  and  offices.  Base  case  financial \ninternal rates of return for the Bayankhoshuu core subproject is 20.75%, and for the Selbe core \nsubproject  is  21.61%,  exceeding  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  5.49%. \nSensitivity analysis showed that the core subprojects were vulnerable to decreases in revenues. \nUnder output 1, a financial sustainability analysis of MUB was conducted in lieu of estimating the \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\ncore subprojects\u2019 financial rates of return. It confirmed MUB has the capacity to absorb the debt \nservicing  and  operation  and  maintenance  requirements  of  the  core  subprojects.  Financial  due \ndiligence for the FIL component was carried out on XacBank as a sample representative bank in \nMongolia. XacBank qualifies as a participating bank and meets ADB\u2019s performance standards in \nterms  of  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  management,  earnings,  and  liquidity.  The  bank  was \ndeemed  financially  viable  and  capable  of  meeting  financial  obligations,  including  debt  service \npayments. A debt sustainability assessment was conducted and the bank\u2019s financial standing was \nassessed to be sufficiently robust to absorb the related credit risks of the subprojects as well as \nthe  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  risks.  The  integrity  due  diligence  carried  out  on  XacBank \nshowed that there are no significant integrity risks. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MUB, and DBM. The specific policy requirements are described in the PAM. \nThe financial management risk of MUB is moderate as it has established a fully functional project \nmanagement office that is currently implementing ongoing ADB projects (footnote 13). Also, MUB \ndeveloped and made operational a financial management system that incorporates ADB\u2019s loan \nand  grant  disbursement policies  and  procedures.  Refinements  to the  system  to  accommodate \nchanges will be provided by the project capacity development support. The financial management \nassessment on AMC-DBM indicated two significant risks and corresponding mitigating measures: \n(i) as a newly established entity, AMC-DBM may lack the capability to manage the EDAF outright, \nand DBM has provided assurance that it will assign or engage qualified and experienced staff to \nAMC-DBM; and (ii) because AMC-DBM lacks prior experience in managing ADB disbursements \nand  is  not familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as amended from  time to \ntime), AMC-DBM has committed to undertake the needed staff training to comply with ADB\u2019s loan \ndisbursement policies and procedures. Capacity building support, incorporating relevant financial \nmanagement  training,  will  complement  AMC-DBM\u2019s  planned  risk  mitigating  measures.  All \nprocurement  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time).28 \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  project\u2019s  direct  beneficiaries  include  10,000  households  who  will  have  access  to \nhousing units and a total of about 17,000 households that will benefit from both living and working \nin 100 ha of ger areas developed into eco-districts. A total of 229 households, living within the \nperimeter  of  the  core  subprojects  located  in  Bayankhoshuu  and  Selbe  subcenters,  will  benefit \nfrom  onsite  redevelopment  through  the  voluntary  land  swapping  mechanism,  and  about \n2,000 households will benefit from living and working in fully developed eco-districts. To ensure \nfull  realization  of  the  benefits,  the  community  participation  plan  (CPP)  and  social  and  gender \naction plan (SGAP) include a public awareness component, an education program, consultations, \nand  participation  activities.29 The  CPP  and  SGAP  will  ensure  continued  consultation  with  and \nparticipation  of  the  local  communities  and  guide  the  community  mobilization  and  consultation \nprocesses throughout implementation. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                 \n28 Universal  procurement  will  apply  per  ADB.  2013.

The SGAP presents specific \n20. \neffective  gender  mainstreaming  measures  and  outlines  the  strategies  to  address  key  gender \nconcerns  with respect to  access  to  services  and livelihood  opportunities  to  be  provided  by  the \nproject,  and  to  ensure  that  project  components  will  be  gender-responsive,  appropriate,  and \naffordable to its target users, especially vulnerable households. The CPP and SGAP also include \nmeasures to (i) facilitate and support the affected communities to avoid any loss of livelihood and \nbusiness; (ii) support vulnerable households that lack the financial means to afford better houses \nthrough  skills  training  and  linkages  with  job  opportunities,  training,  and  financial  institutions; \n(iii) identify and integrate beneficiary community needs in project design documents; (iv) sustain \nawareness  and  support  for  the  project  by  different  stakeholders;  (v)  mobilize  and  organize \nbeneficiary community members to support the development and implementation of houses and \ninfrastructure;  and  (vi)  facilitate  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  different  aspects  of \nthese  components.  Consulting  services\u2014185  person-months  of  inputs  (45  international  and \n140 national)\u2014will  be  provided  to  support  MUB  in  establishing  the  mechanisms,  and \nimplementing and monitoring the CPP and SGAP. \n \nE. \n \n21. \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n22. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination,  environmental \nmanagement  plan,  and  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  were  prepared  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.31 The  anticipated  environmental  impacts \nduring construction include dust and noise, temporary traffic disturbance, and risks to community \nand workers\u2019 health and safety. The demolition of ger houses will not produce toxic waste as ger \nhouses  are  not  made  from  toxic  materials.  Demolished  housing  materials  will  be  disposed  at \nlandfill sites approved by MUB. Affected plot owners and local communities were consulted on \nany  issues  or  concerns  they  have  with  the  project.  Mitigation  measures  defined  in  the \nenvironmental management plan, such as construction site management and regular monitoring \nof the environmental performance during construction and operation, will minimize the anticipated \nimpacts  and  construction-related  health  and  safety  concerns.  Ensuing  subprojects  with  similar \ncomponents are expected to be category B for environment as no category A subproject will be \nfinanced under the project. The carbon emission reduction estimated for the project is 200,000 \ntons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, equal to 8 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \nduring the project lifetime (40 years). The project will also contribute to black carbon reduction of \nabout 83 tons per year.32 \n \n23. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). For output 1, a resettlement framework has been \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for areas outside the project eco-\ndistricts\u2019  perimeters  where  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  expected.  The  resettlement \nframework will serve as a guide for screening project for involuntary resettlement impacts, and for \npreparation  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans.  Infrastructure \nconstruction impacts outside the perimeters of the eco-districts\u2014such as widening of roads and \nconstruction of utilities to connect the eco-districts with main trunk infrastructure\u2014 will be avoided  \nor mitigated to the  extent  possible. The  selection  criteria for the redevelopment  blocks  include \n                                                 \n30 ADB.

Activities with category A involuntary resettlement impacts will \nbe excluded. \n \nVoluntary land swapping. The project will implement a demand-driven approach within \n24. \nthe  perimeters  of  the  project  eco-districts,  based  on  a  voluntary  land  swapping  mechanism, \nsupported by voluntary land swapping plans (VLSPs).33 The proposed resettlement is voluntary \nin  nature  as  households  will  be  provided  with  an  option  to  participate  or not.34 Each  VLSP  will \ncover landowners and non-landowners, with provisions for poor and vulnerable households as \nwell  as  for  affected  persons  under  ADB\u2019s  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas \nDevelopment Investment Program (footnote 13).35 Depending on the socioeconomic situation of \neach household, an affordable housing solution will be proposed through a land and asset swap \nagreement, a rent-to-own scheme, or an affordable rental scheme.36 Meaningful consultations are \nincorporated in the three stages of project cycle (identification, feasibility, and detailed design) to \nensure that potential beneficiaries are fully informed about the project and its implications, and to \nbuild  a  consensus  among  households  living  on  a  plot  of  land  regarding  whether  or  not  to \nparticipate  in  the  project.  Such  consultations  will  also  help  to  address  concerns  of  potential \nbeneficiaries, and any adverse impacts.37 If households on a plot decide not to participate after \nundertaking  consultations,  the  proposed  eco-district  will  be  redesigned  to  avoid  the  non-\nparticipating plot.38 Notwithstanding that the proposed resettlement for the project eco-districts is \nvoluntary, the VLSPs will be prepared and implemented to avoid or minimize impacts during the \ntransition period, and improve the standard of living of the potential beneficiaries, especially the \npoor and other vulnerable households. \n \nA  VLSP  has  been  prepared  for  two  core  subprojects  (Selbe  and  Bayankhoshuu).  The \n25. \npotential beneficiaries of the two core subprojects include 78 landowners and 52 non-landowners \nin Selbe and 64 landowners and 35 non-landowners in Bayankhoshuu.39 The VLSP specifies the \n(i) principles of and procedures for voluntary land and/or asset swapping, based on transparency, \nconsistency,  and  fairness;40 (ii)  meaningful  consultation  and  participation  during  identification, \nfeasibility study, detailed design, and implementation to ensure that participation of landowners \n                                                 \n33 The  VLSP  has  been  designed  to  maximize  the  project  benefits  to  the  local  population  by  promoting  an  \u201cin-situ\u201d \nmechanism that preserves the fabric of communities and improves the quality of housing and urban infrastructure at \nan affordable cost. \n\n34 Specifically, a plot of land within the perimeter of an eco-district will be included in an eco-district redevelopment only \n\nif the residents of the plot (including owners and non-owners of the plot) are willing to participate. \n\n35 Affected people under other ADB projects implemented in ger areas, including ADB\u2019s ongoing Ulaanbaatar Urban \nServices  and  Ger  Areas  Development  Investment  Program,  will  have  priority  access  to  affordable  housing  with \nsubsidized mortgages, or rent and rent-to-own housing. \n\n36 For non-landowners or renters, priority access will be given to rental or social housing based on rent-to-own or rental \nschemes, depending on their income. For poor households (belonging to the income decile categories from 1 to 3), \nthe  monthly  housing  costs  (including  rent  and  utility  fees)  will  not  exceed  25%  of  the  monthly  income  of  one \nhousehold. For the most vulnerable households, specific measures will be taken to ensure that they will not pay more \nthan they currently do for their rent and/or utilities services. Additionally, targeted employment and training program \nwill be implemented for poor households. \n\n37 Potential  coercive  practices  are  mitigated  by  the  consultation  process;  verification  by  an  independent  external \nmonitor; and a grievance redress mechanism with documentation of consultation meetings, grievances, and actions \ntaken to address such grievances. \n\n38 The location, design, and shape of an eco-district is not predetermined. It will be developed and adapted based on \nthe willingness of households living on a plot to participate and can change until finalization of the detailed design. \n39 Based on  the  sample socioeconomic survey  in  Table  37 in  the  VLSP, it  is  estimated  that  there are  69  poor  and \n\nvulnerable households. The numbers will be verified during detailed design. \n\n40 A  written  record  of  consultations  and  willingness  to  participate  surveys  undertaken  during  the  identification  and \n\nfeasibility study are presented in the VLSP. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fand  non-landowners  is  based  on  an  informed  decision  that  is  free  of  intimidation  or  coercion; \n(iii) land and asset valuation methodology, which is based on replacement cost;41 (iv) support to \npotential beneficiaries, especially the poor and vulnerable households, through access to social \nhousing, cash grants, and livelihood improvement programs; (v) written record of ownership of \nthe  apartment  unit  for  landowners  as  well  as  other  housing  arrangements  (including  social \nhousing) for non-landowners; (vi) establishment of a grievance redress mechanism that requires \nproper documentation of grievances, and actions taken to address such grievances; (vii) budget \nrequirements and availability of funds for community engagement, green economy and business \nopportunity  development,  provision  of  a  training  and  capacity  building  program  for  livelihood \nimprovement,  consulting  services,  management  and  administration  costs,  and  external \nmonitoring; (viii) institutional arrangements and support from project implementation consultants, \nwith clear roles and responsibilities; (ix) setting up of internal monitoring; and (x) engagement of \nan external monitor to validate the process and procedures set out in the VLSP, specifically the \nvalidation  of  the  negotiation  process.  VLSP  implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  and \nsupervised by ADB. The VLSP for the two core subprojects has been reviewed and cleared by \nADB, and disclosed to potential beneficiaries (on 27 May 2018, with a revised version disclosed \non 5 July 2018).42 Eco-district development for subsequent subprojects will have similar VLSPs. \n \n26. \ngroup has been identified and no adverse impact is expected. \n \n27. \nFinancial  intermediaries  (category  B).  An  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem (ESMS) will be adopted. For core subprojects, an ESMS arrangement was prepared and, \nbased  on  a  due  diligence  of  XacBank,  it  was  found  that  XacBank  has  adequate  institutional \ncapacity  to  implement  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  procedural  and  substantive \nrequirements  contained  in  the  ESMS.  An  ESMS  will  be  developed  by  each  participating \ncommercial bank prior to loan disbursement. Financial intermediaries will ensure that there will \nbe  no  subproject  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  the  environment.
