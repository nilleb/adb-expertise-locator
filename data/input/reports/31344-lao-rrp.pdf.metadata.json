The  formal  forestry  sector  contributes  about  5%  to  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  and  accounts  for  34%  of  total  export  value,  and \neven more of net foreign exchange earnings. But these trends have been \naccompanied by decline in forest cover from 70% in 1970 to approximately \n42%  in  2000,  resulting  in  vast  areas  of  degraded  forestland  that  can  be \nbrought  under  productive  forest  plantations.  Lao  PDR,  along  the  Lao \nMekong Plains, has significant potential and comparative advantage over \nits  neighbors  to  develop  financially  viable  forest  plantations  subsector \nbecause  of:  (i)  suitable  climate  and  site  conditions  for  growing  trees; \n(ii) low population density; (iii) vast areas of degraded forestland; (iv) flat or \nundulating  terrain;  (v)  an  existing  road  infrastructure  that  is  being \nupgraded;  (vi)  access  to  large  markets  in  neighboring  countries;  (vii)  low \ncosts for land lease; and (viii) competitive costs for labor and inputs. The \nProject will establish a new institution, the Lao Plantation Authority (LPA), \nwhich  will  spearhead  efficient  and  sustainable  development  of  the \nplantations subsector in Lao PDR, combined with livelihood improvement \nand poverty reduction. It will provide full-package service to livelihood and \nenterprise  plantations  and  one-window  service  to  facilitate  operations  of \nmultinational  companies  to  develop  industrial  plantations.  LPA  will  be  a \nfinancially viable and self-sustaining institution. \n \nThe  Industrial  Tree  Plantation  Project  (ITPP)  was  rated  \u201cunsuccessful\u201d  in \nthe  recent  project  completion  report,  as  it  could  not  meet  its  designed \noutcome. Reasons include: (i) inappropriate site selection, (ii) poor quality \nplanting stock, (iii) inadequate skills among Department of Forestry (DOF) \nstaff,  (iv)  subsidized  credit  prone  to  abuse,  (v)  inadequate  and  ill-timed \nexpert  inputs,  and  (vi)  insufficient  supervision  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB).  However,  ITPP  has  established  that:  (i)  efficient  forest \nplantations of all sizes are financially viable, and (ii) existing Government \ninstitutions  have  inadequate  capacity  to  provide  effective  support  to  this \nimportant  and  emerging  subsector.  During \nthe  preparation  and \nimplementation of ITPP, it was assumed that the capacity of DOF could be \nstrengthened  to  provide  the  necessary  support  to  forest  plantations.  The \nexperience of ITPP has demonstrated that supporting forest plantations is \na  highly  specialized  task  that  requires  a  different  set  of  skills  and \noperational modalities than required for natural forest management, which \n\n\fii \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nis  the  mainstay  of  DOF\u2019s  experience  and  expertise.  Plantations  form  a \nniche  subsector;  individual  staff  and  institutions  require  specific  and \nproven  capacity  from  raising  nurseries  to  marketing  plantation  products. \nSimilarly,  the  financing  of  forest  plantations  requires  a  specific  lending \nproduct\u2014equity  financing  or  full-term  credit\u2014for  which  assessment, \ndelivery,  and  collection  have  to  be  synchronized  with  the  establishment, \nproduction, and felling cycles of plantations. Taking medium-term loans is \nimpractical  as  there  is  no  interim  income  to  service  interest  payments \nduring  the  8-year  rotation.  Furthermore,  the  Agricultural  Promotion  Bank, \nestablished  in  1994,  was  in  no  position  then  or  now  to  cope  with  the \ndemands and requirements of this subsector. \n \nAn ineffective land-use planning and tenure system continue to constrain \nthe  development  of  livelihood  and  large-scale  industrial  plantations.  The \ncurrent  3-year  term  for  a  temporary  land-use  certificate,  which  can  be \nrolled  over,  requires  formal  confirmation  and  registration.  This  process  is \nconstrained  by  inadequate  capacity  of  existing  Government  institutions, \nalthough it is provided for by the Land Law. It is essential that issuance of \nland-use certificates is synchronized with the plantation rotation cycle. LPA \nwill set up a land registry and facilitate the issuance of land-use certificates \nto  livelihood  planters  after  they  have  established  their  credentials  as \nserious operators at the end of the first 8-year rotation. \n \nThe relevant rules and regulations need refinement and clarification. Land-\nindustrial \nlease  agreement  negotiations  with \nplantations,  are  time-consuming  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI) \nprocedures  in  this  subsector  are  not  always  transparent.  Plantation \nmanagement  guidelines\u2014appropriate  to  the  scale/type  of  plantations\u2014\nshould  be  developed  and  made  operational.  In  particular,  harvesting  and \ntransit rules need to be rationalized to avoid marketing and delivery delays \nand  minimize  rent-seeking  opportunities.  Similarly,  plantation  logs  and \nwoodchips should be exempted from export duties and restrictions so that \nthe foreign exchange earning potential of the subsector is fully realized.  \n \nCurrent institutional and staff capacity constraints are preventing Lao PDR \nfrom  (i)  developing  a  vibrant  plantations  subsector,  and  (ii)  capturing  the \neconomic  development  potential  of  its  land  and  water  resources.  The \nForest Plantations Development Project (the Project), by establishing LPA, \nwill  address  these  institutional,  human  resource,  and  technological \nconstraints.  LPA  will  provide  the  necessary  support  to  all  types  of  clients \nefficiently,  and  will  facilitate  the  enforcement  of  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  contribute  to  steady  economic  growth, \naccelerated poverty reduction, and improved environmental conservation. \nAs  a  direct  outcome  of  the  Project,  an  efficient  and  equitable  forest \nplantations  subsector  would  take  off.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  of \nparticipating  households,  create  a  substantial  plantation  resource,  and \ncatalyze large-scale international private investment in plantations that will \nlead  to  the  development  of  a  modern  wood  processing  industry.  The \nProject  will  achieve  its  objectives  by:  (i)  establishing  a  semiautonomous, \n\nthe  Government, \n\nfor \n\n\fiii \n\nsustainable, and efficient new institution to support the development of this \nsubsector;  and  (ii)  supporting  financially  viable  livelihood  and  enterprise \nplantations, and facilitating the establishment of industrial plantations and \nthe  associated  processing  industry.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by: \n(i) generating  income  and  employment  opportunities  for  unskilled  and \nsemiskilled  rural  poor;  (ii)  creating  assets  for  poor  households;  and \n(iii) raising substantial revenues and foreign exchange for the Government \nto improve the country\u2019s fiscal and balance of payments situation. \n \nThe Project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties is estimated at \n$15.35  million  equivalent,  consisting  of  foreign  exchange  costs  of \n$6.45 million (42%) and local currency costs of $8.90 million (58%). \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nPercent \n\n2.90 \n1.30 \n0.00 \n\n4.10 \n1.70 \n0.65 \n\nADB Loan \nADF Grant \nGovernment of \nMalaysia \n0.00 \nGovernment  \n0.00 \nLocal Banks \n0.00 \nBeneficiaries \n \n6.45 \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \nNote: Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2.12 \n0.29 \n2.29 \n8.90 \n\n \n \nA loan in various currencies in special drawing rights (SDR), equivalent to \n$7 million, will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.

Its  operations  will  be  divided  into  four \ndivisions,  nine  units,  and  a  public  relations  office.  Each  division  will  be \nheaded  by  a  director.  The  Livelihood  and  Industrial  Plantations  are \nexecuting  divisions,  while  the  Land  Survey  and  Finance  and  Human \nResources are support divisions. As a semiautonomous agency, the BOD \nwill be empowered by the Government, through a prime ministerial decree, \nto  implement  LPA\u2019s  mandate.  BOD  will  approve:  (i)  appointment  of  LPA \nstaff; (ii) LPA\u2019s quarterly, annual, and long-term work plans; (iii) land-lease \nagreements  for  enterprise  and  industrial  plantations;  and  (iv)  business \nproposals for setting up processing industries. The BOD will be chaired by \nthe Vice Minister of MAF. Other relevant line agencies will be represented \nby  deputy  director  generals  or  an  official  of  higher  rank.  LPA  will  be  run \nlike  a  corporate  body,  and  annual  financial  and  technical  audits  will  be \ncarried out by external auditors. It will issue an annual report. \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, \nequipment,  civil  works,  and  materials  will  be  procured  by  international \ncompetitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent,  or  by  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is  valued  from \n$100,000 to $500,000 equivalent. Where several local suppliers can offer \nsatisfactory  service  facilities,  then  vehicles,  equipment,  civil  works,  and \nmaterials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured under \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures,  or  through  direct  purchase.  Final \ndetails  for  procurement  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation \nas appropriate. To commence the Project on time, ADB has approved, at \nthe  Government\u2019s \nfor  procurement.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of such advance action does \nnot commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \nAt  full  strength  by  year-3,  LPA  will  have  a  total  of  40  management  and \nprofessional  staff.  During  the  first  12\u201318  months  after  its  inception,  LPA \nwill be staffed in stages according to its work plan. An interim-CTA (iCTA) \nwill be recruited for about 6 months, and will be responsible for searching \nand short listing candidates for the tenured CTA position. All staff positions \nwill  be  filled  with  qualified  individuals,  as  defined  against  each  position, \nfollowing  a  transparent  process.  The  iCTA/CTA  will  be  empowered  to \nsearch,  shortlist,  interview,  and  select  staff.  BOD  will  approve  the \nrecruitment of selected candidate(s) after LPA receives concurrence from \nADB and the Government of Malaysia. Four internationally recruited staff \nwill  be  engaged  (252  person-months).  The  iCTA/CTA  will  be  offered  a \ncompetitive  package,  comparable  to  those  provided  by  similar  private \nsector  multinationals  and  development  agencies.  Three  experts,  to \nsupervise  3  divisional  directors,  will  be  seconded  by  the  Government  of \nMalaysia.  Some  35  nationally  recruited  professional  staff  (2,520  person-\nmonths)  and  24  support  staff  (1,728  person-months)  will  be  offered \nemployment  packages  comparable  with  those  provided  by  multinational \ncompanies  operating  in  Lao  PDR,  in  order  to  attract  and  retain  highly \nskilled staff. \n \n\nrequest,  advance  action \n\n\fv \n\nlivelihood  plantations \n\n \nSuitably  qualified  Lao  nationals  will  be  engaged  as  directors  of  divisions \nand will work under the supervision of respective international experts and \nthe  CTA.  A  staff  transition  plan  will  be  prepared  at  the  outset  to  include \nnecessary  on-the-job  and  short-term  training  of  Lao  staff  to  take  on  the \nresponsibilities  without  the  supervision  of  international  experts  starting  in \nyears 4\u20135  of  project  implementation.  However,  it  is  anticipated  that  an \ninternational CTA may be required even beyond project completion. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  core  interventions  in  livelihood,  enterprise,  and  industrial \nplantations  will  have  significant  impact  on  the  income  of  participating \nplanters  and  entrepreneurs.  Small \n(SLPs), \nestablished  on  9,500  hectares  (ha),  will  be  financially  viable,  create  full-\ntime  employment  for  the  2,000  participating  households,  and  increase \ntheir  cash  income  within  the  first  year  from  $150  to  $385  per  ha  per \nannum.  This  increase  will  pull  average  household\u2019s  total  annual  income \nabove the food poverty line of $738 (footnote 19). A typical household with \n5  ha  allocation  will  be  pulled  above  the  food  poverty  line  with  a  constant \nstream  of  income  from  labor  inputs  on  their  own  plantations  for  the  next \n5 years.  LPA  will  compensate  them  for  their  labor  inputs  as  part  of  its \nequity  in  SLPs.  From  years  8\u201312,  household  will  receive  on  average \n$858/ha/year  income  as  its  share  of  the  revenues.  These  revenues  will \nmore than double their total annual household income and increase their \ncash income by six times. In the process, livelihood plantations will create \na resourceful asset for poor households, for which they will receive land-\nuse  certificate  at  the  end  of  first  8-year  rotation.  This  increase  in  income \nand  asset  creation  will  have  significant  impact  on  poverty  reduction  and \nthe  general  well-being  of  the  average  household.  With  this  level  of  cash \nincome,  the  household  will  be  able  to  afford  basic  education,  primary \nhealthcare,  and  more  nutritious  food.  The  multiplier  effect\u2014with  more \nopportunities  for  trade  and  employment\u2014could  dramatically  change  the \nsocioeconomic profiles of participating villages within 8\u201310 years. \n \nEven if only half the expressions of interest from multinational companies \nmaterialize,  the  pace  of  development  in  the  plantations  subsector  would \nbe  significant.  Conservative  estimates  show  that  as  much  as  150,000 ha \nmay  be  under  industrial  plantations  by  2015.  This  scale  of  development \nwould  create  massive  employment  opportunities.  Even  10,000  ha/year  of \nplantation development will create 1 million person-days employment. This \nwould result in labor shortages, requiring increasingly mechanized means \nof  plantation  management.  This  transformation  would  lead  to  higher \nwages, jobs with better skills, and a significant multiplier effect on regional \nand national economies. \n \nforest \nEstablishment  of  LPA  and \nplantations subsector would entail political, institutional, market, business, \nfinancial,  and  environmental  risks.  The  establishment  of  LPA  is  a  unique \ndevelopment  in  Lao  PDR  and  is  a  high-risk  high-return  investment. \nHowever,  all  these  risks\u2014individually  as  well  as  collectively\u2014can  be \nmanaged  and  mitigated.  LPA  would  be  able  to  effectively  mitigate  all \nexcept the political risk. There are two types of political risks: one would be \n\nlarge-scale  development  of \n\nthe \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \n\nfaced by LPA itself and the other by Lao PDR. To mitigate the political risk \nfaced  by  Lao  PDR,  ADB  could  provide  a  political  risk  guarantee  to \nqualified foreign investors. But mitigation of political risk for the LPA would \ndepend  on  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  allow  LPA  to  practice  its \nautonomy without interference. By approving a prime ministerial decree for \nestablishing LPA, the Government will demonstrate its commitment to LPA \nas  a  semiautonomous  body.  The  Government  has  provided  specific \nassurances,  and  key  triggers  have  been  covenanted  in  the  Loan \nAgreement, to stall and/or withdraw support in case LPA does not operate \nin  accordance  with  its  agreed  design.  ADB  and  the  Government  of \nMalaysia  will  provide  close  supervision  by  deploying  skilled  and \nexperienced international experts in LPA\u2019s formative years. ADB will also \nprovide active and rigorous project supervision to ensure that political risk \nis effectively mitigated. \n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the \nForest  Plantations  Development  Project  (the  Project).  The  project  processing  chronology  is  in \nAppendix 1.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nForest Sector and the National Economy \n\nThe  total  land  area  of  Lao  PDR  is  236,800  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  the  present \n2. \nforest cover is approximately 42%. About 25,000 km2 (2.5 million hectares [ha]) are designated \nproduction  forests  and  another  35,000  km2  have  potential  for  commercial  production.  The \nremaining 80,000 km2 are classed forest fallow and scrub. Although the predominant economic \nsector  of  Lao  PDR  is  agriculture\u2014involving  85%  of  the  country\u2019s  5.6  million  people\u2014in  some \nrural areas, forest resource exploitation can be one of the few available economic activities. For \nmany rural poor, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) may provide more than half the household \nincome. The water sector is also of vital importance to the economy for irrigation, hydropower, \nand  fish  resources.  Water,  in  turn,  is  heavily  dependent  on  forests  for  protecting  catchments \nfrom soil erosion and maintaining seasonal water flow. \n \nThe  formal  forestry  sector  contributes  about  5%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \n3. \nand  accounts  for  34%  of  total  export  value,  and  even  more  of  net  foreign  exchange earnings. \nSawn  wood  was  the  most  valuable  export  product,  but  the  wood  industry  was  predominately \nbased  on  logs  from  natural  forests  and  industrial  capacity  exceeded  long-term  sustainable \nannual  allowable  cut.  As  a  result,  the  Government  introduced  a  ban  on  the  export  of  logs  in \n2000  and  the  harvest  of  natural  wood  decreased  from  730,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  in  1999  to \n200,000 m3 in 2001. Government revenues from log royalties have decreased from 20% in the \nmid-1990s  to  6%  of  tax  revenues  and  5%  of  all  revenues  in  2000.  No  data  is  available  on \nspecific  financial  values  deriving  from  forest  plantations,  but  the  contribution  is  still  small.  A \nnumber  of  foreign-funded  projects  have  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  investment \nfinancing to the forestry sector since the late 1970s (Appendix 2). \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Strategies \n\n4. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy  for  2020  forecasts  GDP \ngrowth  of  7%  per  annum.  By  2010,  the  Government  aims  to  reduce  poverty  by  half  from  its \ncurrent level of 39%. Furthermore, there is a national commitment to attain 70% forest cover by \n2020\u2014accomplished  through  forest  rehabilitation  and  planting.  Therefore,  in  formulating  the \nNational  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES)2,  the  Government  attached  great \n\n                                                 \n1   The Project is included in ADB. 2004.

National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy. \n\nVientiane. \n\n\f2 \n\nimportance  to  forest  protection  and  reforestation.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the  significant \npotential  forests  can  make  to  national  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  environmental  and \nbiodiversity protection, and sequestration of carbon to mitigate its impact on global climate.  \n \nNGPES  aspires  to  meet  its  objectives  through  natural  resource  development.  Future \n5. \ngrowth-enhancing investments and development priorities, which reflect the economic potential \nof  the  country\u2019s  natural  resource  base,  have  been  identified  as  means  to  increase  national \nrevenues and eradicate poverty. Hydropower, mining, tourism, and wood- and agro-processing \nindustries are the highest priorities for such investments. Royalties and taxes to the Government \nwill comprise the bulk of the revenues generated by these investments. Emphasis will be placed \non  promoting  economic  growth  centers  throughout  the  country  to  further  develop  the  rich \nendowment of natural resources including land, water, forest, and biodiversity. This includes the \nidentification  and  delineation  of  regions  to  better  integrate  economic,  infrastructure, trade,  and \nservices  development.  Macroeconomic  stability,  private  sector  development,  trade  facilitation, \nand  regional  integration  policies  and  strategies  all  feed  into  expanding  this  resource  base  to \npromote economic growth nationwide. \n \nRecently,  the  Government  adopted  the  comprehensive  Forest  Strategy  2020.3  This \n6. \nstrategy consolidates the Government\u2019s vision and related policies to develop the forestry sector \nand  plantations  subsector  on  a  sustainable  basis.  To  implement  NGPES  and  Forest  Strategy \n2020,  the  Government  wishes  to  promote  both  private  and  public  sector  investments  in  forest \nplantations development. The objective is to develop the plantations subsector on a large scale \nto  create  substantial  supply  of  industrial  raw  material  and  generate  employment.  This  will \neventually lead to the expansion of the country\u2019s wood-processing industry and enable Lao PDR \nto become a major supplier of wood products to international markets, which are experiencing \nan increasing deficit of wood and fiber supplies. To mobilize the necessary financial resources, \nthe  Government  aims  to  promote  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  in  the  forest  plantations \nsubsector.  The  Government  also  encourages  the  participation  of  poor  households  in \nestablishing forest plantations for livelihoods by allocating suitable lands in rural areas. \n \n\n3. \n\nSector Policies and Regulations \n\nlegislation\u2014foreign \n\ninvestment,  business, \n\nThere  are  about  26  pieces  of \n\ntax, \n7. \nenvironmental,  land,  water,  and  forest  laws,  decrees,  regulations,  and  orders\u2014that  govern \ndifferent  aspects  of  forest  plantations  and  associated  industrial  processing  in  Lao  PDR. \nTherefore,  establishing  forest  plantations  in  the  country  entails  compliance  with  a  complex \nregulatory  framework.  The  plantation  development  process,  from  land  allocation  to  harvesting \nand  marketing  of  logs,  is  covered  by  multiple  regulations  enforced  by  different  Government \nagencies  and  departments.  About  12  licenses,  permits,  and  approvals  are  required  at  various \nstages. Many of these are linked to the size of the land area, as larger plantation areas require \nhigher-level approval. The regulations derive from various laws, subsidiary decrees, and orders \nfrom  several  different  ministries.  Some  of  the  approvals  or  licenses  must  be  obtained  before \napplication can be made for others, so it is not possible to secure all of them at one time from \none  place.  Nonetheless,  Lao  PDR  has  an  adequate  set  of  policies  and  regulations  to  govern \ndevelopment of the forest plantations subsector. A comprehensive review of the relevant laws, \ndecrees,  regulations,  and  orders,  as  well  as  a  proposed  policy  and  regulatory  framework,  are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2005. Forest Strategy 2020. Vientiane. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nADB's  Policy  on  Forestry  (1995) \n\nidentifies  plantations  as  a  sustainable  and \n8. \nenvironmentally  sound  source  of  industrial  raw  material  and  means  for  enhancing  rural \nemployment  opportunities  and  household  incomes.  It  recommends  the  establishment  of  fast-\ngrowing,  high-yielding  tree  plantations  in  selected  degraded  forests  and  grasslands  with  the \ninvolvement  of  the  private  sector  (corporations,  communities,  and  individual  households).  It \nrecommends  a  participatory  process  involving  primary  project  beneficiaries  and  relevant \nstakeholders  in  establishing  land  tenure  status,  site  and  species  selection,  and  decisions  on \nplantation silviculture and management regimes. The Lao PDR Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate, 2005\u20132006 identifies the forest plantations subsector as having significant potential to \ndiversify traditional subsistence agriculture in the country. \n \n\n4. \n\nForest Plantations Development \n\n9. \nPlanting  of  fast-growing  exotic  tree  species  (e.g.,  Eucalyptus  and  Acacia)  for  industrial \npurposes started in Lao PDR about 10 years ago. The ADB-supported Industrial Tree Plantation \nProject (ITPP)4 pioneered this development and established about 9,000 ha in Vientiane Capital \nand  Vientiane,  Bolikhamxay,  Khammuane,  Savannakhet,  Saravane,  and  Champasack \nprovinces.5 Since 1999, additional plantations have been established through the Government's \nreplanting schemes. The current total area of forest plantations in Lao PDR has been estimated \nat  95,000  ha.6  But  most  of  these  consist  of  teak  plantations  in  the  northern  provinces.  Forest \nStrategy  2020  has  an  ambitious  goal  of  establishing  plantations  on  500,000 ha  by  2020.  The \ntarget  for  each  of  the  seven  ITPP  provinces  is  around  50,000  ha  in  the  same  period. \nDevelopment of livelihood plantations is an effective way to reduce poverty because it helps the \nGovernment implement NGPES and Forest Sector Strategy 2020, generate employment, create \nassets, and provide additional and alternative sources of income for poor households. \n \n\n5. \n\nWood Processing Industry \n\nCompared with other countries, the wood processing industry is small, with annual sawn \n10. \nwood  and  plywood  production  of  approximately  250,000  m3,  mainly  using  logs  from  natural \nforest. Forest plantations also produce sawlogs (20\u201345 cm diameter) and pulplogs (10\u201320  cm \ndiameter). The latter are the predominant output at present, as the plantations are still young. \nAlthough  processing  of  plantation  logs  commenced  less  than  5  years  ago,  there  are  two \nvertically  integrated  factories  in  the  Vientiane  area  focusing  on  plantation  grown  logs.  The \ncombined  capacity  is  approximately  3,000  m3  per  annum.  But  insufficient  kiln  drying  capacity \nand  raw  material  supply  is  causing  underutilization  of  capacity.  Despite  such  problems,  these \nfactories  have  secured  contracts  with  international  companies  that  distribute  a  wide  range  of \nvalue-added  wood  products  throughout  the  world.  However,  the  subsector  is  not  competitive \ninternationally because: (i) insufficient capacity does not make it a credible supplier, (ii) it lacks \ncritical  manufacturing  mass,  and  (iii)  transport  costs  are  high.  Because  of  these  constraints, \nwhich  all  relate  to  lack  of  economies  of  scale,  production  of  sawn  timber  products  from \nEucalyptus camaldulensis is barely profitable. \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  1993.

Therefore,  it  is  safe  to  assume  that  the  actual  total  planting  area  under  ITPP  may  be  about \n9,000 ha.  \n\n6   Data from National Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service/Plantation and Reforestation Extension Centre. \n\n\f4 \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nWeak Institutional Capacity \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  is  the  main  national  level  institution \n11. \nresponsible  for  all  aspects  of  forestry  administration,  including  inspection.  During  2001\u20132002, \nMAF was reorganized by establishing three new institutions: (i) Technical and Science Council \nof  Agriculture  and  Forestry,  (ii)  National  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Research  Institute  (NAFRI), \nand  (iii) National  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Extension  Service  (NAFES).  The  reorganization \ntransferred  all  agriculture  and  forestry  research  activities  to  NAFRI,  and  all  agriculture  and \nforestry  extension  activities  (including  ITPP  and  extension  projects)  to  NAFES.  However,  the \nDepartment  of  Forestry  (DOF)  maintains  responsibility  for  administering  and  regulating  the \nforest  plantations  subsector.  MAF  is  now  composed  of  12  departments/units,  of  which  seven \nhave  cross-cutting  responsibilities  for  different  aspects  of  forestry  administration.  DOF  is \nresponsible  for  forests,  plantations,  and  wood  industry  administrative  matters  and  activities, \nincluding  inspection.  DOF  is  organized  in  three  divisions  and  two  sections.  NAFES  has  three \nsections  (extension  and  project  management,  administration  and  planning,  and  rural \ndevelopment)  and  two  subsector  training  centers  (livestock,  and  agriculture  and  forestry).  In \nmid-2005,  NAFES  reorganized  its  Provincial/District  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Extension \nServices  (PAFES/DAFES);  the  primary  interface  between  MAF,  villages,  and  farmers.  PAFES \nhas technical staff in charge of sector work for livestock, agriculture, forestry, and irrigation.  \n \nAt the provincial level, there are Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Offices (PAFOs).7 At \n12. \nthe  field  level,  forestry  administration  is  carried  out  by  the  village  committees  in  charge  of  tax \ncollection.  PAFOs  are  divided  into  seven  sections,  of  which  the  Provincial  Forestry  Office  and \nPAFES are primarily concerned with forestry matters. \n \n13. \nThe  overall  capacity  of  all  agricultural  institutions  is  weak.  Those  that  deal  with  the \nforestry  sector  are  no  exception.  The  modest  capacity  that  exists  in  the  forestry  institutions \nmainly  deals  with  the  management  of  natural  forests.  The  forest  plantations  require  different \nsets  of  training  and  skills  ranging  from  land-use  planning  to  site  selection,  raising  modern \nnursery  stock,  extension,  and  marketing.  Forestry  institutions,  at  all  levels  in  the  Government, \nare  neither  geared  nor  motivated  to  undertake  such  a  complex  set  of  tasks.  Under  ITPP,  TA \nwas  provided  to  create  such  capacity  but  it  could  not  create  the  requisite  critical  mass  of \nexpertise. Most of the current NAFES and DOF staff do not have the skills for such tasks. The \nappropriately  educated  and  motivated  individuals  do  not  work  for  Government  institutions \nbecause  of  lack  of  incentives  and  commensurate  compensation.  In  other  countries,  where \nplantations subsectors have done well, autonomous and specialized institutions were set up to \nhandle  the  tasks\u2014Fiji  Pine  Company  of  Fiji;  Sabah  Softwoods  Inc.  in  Sabah,  Malaysia;  and \nFederal Land Development Authority (FELDA) of Malaysia. On the other hand, institutions that \nwere created within the department or at arm\u2019s-length of the department (Perhutani of Indonesia \nand Forest Industry Organization of Thailand) are not as successful and/or efficient. \n \n\n2. \n\nInadequate Human Resources  \n\n14. \nThe  Master  Plan  Study  on  Integrated  Rural  Development  in  Lao  PDR  provides  an \nindication  of  extension  staff  numbers  by  gender  and  level  of  education.8  At  PAFES  level,  only \n\n                                                 \n7   District Agriculture and Forestry Offices (DAFOs) have been changed to DAFES. \n8   Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2003.

At \nDAFES level, there is a much lower level of formal education: only 3% of staff have bachelor or \nhigher educational and 9% have technical education. This analysis shows that there is not only \nan  absolute  scarcity  of  well-trained staff  but  the  level  of  skill  of  those  already  in  service  is  not \ncommensurate  with  job  requirements.  The  proportion  of  women  staff  is  generally  low.  While \nthere are relatively more women at PAFES, there is still a need for increased number of female \nstaff who are better able to understand and assist women farmers. The proportion of staff who \ncan speak an ethnic minority language is low. A more detailed institutional analysis is provided \nin Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned and Related Constraints \n\nThe recent ITPP project completion report (PCR)9 rated it \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d ITPP could not \n15. \nmeet its designed outcome due to the following reasons: (i) poor site selection, (ii) bad quality \nplanting  stock,  (iii)  inadequate  skills  among  DOF  staff,  (iv)  subsidized  credit  prone  to  abuse, \n(v) inadequate  and  ill-timed  expert  inputs,  and  (vi)  insufficient  supervision  by  ADB.  During  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  ITPP,  it  was  assumed  that  the  capacity  of  DOF  could  be \nstrengthened to provide the necessary support to forest plantations. The outcome of ITPP has \ndemonstrated  that  supporting  forest  plantations  is  a  highly  specialized  task  that  requires  an \nentirely different set of skills. Forest plantation development is a niche subsector; individual staff \nand  institutions  need  to  have  specific  and  proven  capacity  for  land-use  planning,  nursery \nraising,  planters\u2019  training,  financial  management,  and  marketing.  Under  ITPP,  DOF  selected \nmany sites that were spread out too thinly over a large area. Therefore, most of the plantations \nwere not established in blocks. Several sites had inappropriate soil conditions; many were acidic \nand/or  had  hard  pans.  Despite  the  guidelines  provided  under  ITPP,  DOF  was  not  able  to \nundertake  appropriate  land-use  planning,  resulting  in  fragmented  plantations  established \nwithout  soil  testing  and  proper  land  preparation.  Geographical  spread  of  livelihood  plantations \nsubstantially increased the cost of extension and marketing. \n \n16. \nThe subsidized credit line, extended through the Agricultural Promotion Bank (APB), was \nabused by many borrowers by either not planting the full area declared or not planting at all. The \namount  of  credit  per  hectare  was  also  set  25\u201335%  higher  than  the  actual  cost  of  plantation \nestablishment  in  most  cases.  In  addition,  APB  had  inadequate  technical  capacity  to  deal  with \nsuch  a  Project  and  effectively  manage  the  line  of  credit.  The  plantation  financing  required  a \nspecific  lending  product  (i.e.,  a  full-term  loan),  for  which  assessment,  delivery,  and  collection \nhave  to  be  synchronized  with  the  establishment,  production,  and  felling  cycles  of  plantations. \nMoreover,  the  interest  payments,  required  from  the  outset,  were  also  a  burden  since  no  cash \nincome  is  generated  from  plantations  in  the  interim  years.  APB  was  established  in  1994  and \nwas in no position, then or now, to cope with the demands and requirements of this subsector. \n \nThe expert inputs for ITPP were inadequate to begin with and were also ill-timed. Most \n17. \nof the technical inputs were already exhausted even before sizeable planting started in year-3 \n(1997) of the Project. ADB changed its project officers frequently and missions were not fielded \nregularly  at  appropriate  stages  of  the  Project.  The  PCR  rated  ADB\u2019s  performance  as \n\u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d \n \n18. \n Land  tenure  for  plantations,  for  both  small  livelihood  and  large  industrial  plantations, \nrequires refinements. The Government now has a policy by which the 3-year term of temporary \nland-use certificates (TLUCs) can be extended. However, it is important that land tenure allows \nlivelihood  planters  transfer  of  user  rights  in  the  interim  and  grants  land  ownership  after  they \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2005.

Approval of land \nlease  agreements  (LLAs)  for  over  10,000  ha  rests  with  the  National  Assembly.  Consideration \nneeds to be given to increasing this threshold to promote more efficient FDI in this subsector. \nLLA  negotiations  with  the  Government  are  time-consuming  and  the  procedures  for  FDI  in  this \nsubsector  are  not  always  transparent.  Plantation  management  guidelines\u2014appropriate  to  the \nscale and type of plantations\u2014also need to be developed. \n \n19. \nAn  important  precursor  to  resolving  the  issues  of  land  tenure  and  LLA  is  land-use \nplanning  and  zoning  according  to  land  capabilities.  Geographic  information  systems  (GISs), \ngeo-positional  satellite  (GPS)  devices,  and  satellite  imagery  provide  powerful  yet  efficient  and \ncost-effective tools to aide in land-use planning and zoning. The Forest Inventory and Planning \nDivision, within DOF, has limited capacity to deal with these tasks. A GIS database of suitable \nlands  for  plantations  must  be  developed,  taking  into  account:  (i)  technical,  environmental,  and \nsocial criteria; (ii) land use for protection and production forests and agriculture; (iii) population \ndensity and levels of poverty; (iv) existing transport infrastructure and wood processing industry; \nand (v) access to markets, etc. \n \n20. \nIn  summary,  ITPP  demonstrated  that:  (i)  due  to  inappropriate  site  selection  and \ninadequate farmer training and support services, average productivity of ITPP plantations is less \nthan half the potential mean annual increment (MAI) of 20 m3/ha/year; (ii) productive plantations \nare  financially  viable  thus  do  not  require  subsidized  credit;  (iii)  there  is  a  need  to  provide  full-\nterm  credit  (or  other  form  of  financing)  that  matures  at  the  end  of  plantation  rotation; \n(iv) extending  the  line  of  credit  through  APB  is  inefficient  due  to  its  weak  capacity  and  lack  of \nmotivation;  (v)  output  markets  do  not  yet  function  efficiently  and  planters  are  duped  by \nintermediaries  into  selling  logs  at  throwaway  prices  because  of  lack  of  knowledge  and  limited \nchoice;  and  (vi)  land  tenure  issues  require  further  refinements.  However,  the  two  main \nconclusions are that: (i) well established and well managed plantations can be financially viable, \nand (ii) existing Government institutions have inadequate capacity to provide effective support to \nthis  subsector.  Therefore,  the  experience  of  ITPP  shows  that  the  future  success  of  small \nlivelihood  plantations  (SLPs)  will  depend  on  coordinated  technical,  financial,  and  market \nsupport. In short, institutions must provide an efficient, full-package service to its clients. \n \nSimilarly, the growing and tangible interest of multinational companies in this subsector, \n21. \nto  establish  large  industrial  plantations  (LIPs),  should  be  facilitated  by  a  well  equipped  and \ntechnically  skilled  institution.  This  process  in  turn  depends  on  coordinated  support  from  a \nnumber  of  relevant  Government  agencies  to  issue  all  the  necessary  permits,  licenses,  and \napprovals.  Such  a  coordinated  service  can  be  effectively  provided  through  an  institution  that \nprovides one-window service to interested private sector investors. \n \n22. \nThe  efficient  development  of  a  financially  viable  plantation  subsector\u2014which  will \nsignificantly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  economic  growth,  and  government  revenues\u2014\nwould  mainly  depend  on  resolving  land  availability  and  land  allocation  issues  efficiently.  As \nshown  by  ITPP,  existing  institutions  and  capacity  will  not  be  able  to  support  plantations  any \nbetter  than  in  the  past.  Hence,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  suitable  alternative  institutional \narrangements as part of the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nOpportunities \n\nEstimates of growth potential for Eucalyptus spp. under ITPP indicate that the MAI for an \n23. \n8-year rotation is 6\u201324 m3/ha/year, depending on site conditions and management practices. At \ncurrent  prices  and  costs,  a  yield  of  at  least  16  m3/ha/year  is  required  for  the  plantation  to  be \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nfinancially  viable.  Therefore,  close  attention  has  to  be  paid  to  site  selection  and  efficient \nmanagement.  MAI  registered  in  other  Eucalyptus  camaldulensis  trial  plots,  under  ITPP,  was \n7-27  m3/ha/year.  Recent  data  from  NAFRI\u2019s  10-year  old  stands  in  the  research  area  in  Nam \nXouang  (Vientiane  Capital)  has  shown  MAI  of  35  m3/ha/year  for  Acacia  auriculiformis  and  30 \nm3/ha/year for the best Eucalyptus urophylla. \n \n24. \nContinued steady economic growth in Lao PDR will increase demand for an expanding \nrange  of  forest  products.  Similarly,  economic  growth  in  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam,  which  has \nresumed following the financial crisis of 1997\u201398, combined with rapid economic growth in the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  India,  is  creating  substantial  growth  in  demand  for  wood  and \nwood  products,  including  woodchips,  pulp,  paper,  and  furniture.  Lao  PDR,  along  the  Lao \nMekong  plains,  has  a  clear  comparative  advantage  over  its  neighbors  and  considerable \npotential  to  develop  a  commercially  viable  forest  plantations  subsector,  because  it  has: \n(i) suitable climate and site conditions for growing trees;10 (ii) low population density;11 (iii) vast \nareas  of  degraded  forest  land;  (iv)  flat  or  undulating  terrain;  (v)  an  existing  road  infrastructure \nthat is being upgraded; (vi) access to large markets in neighboring countries; (vii) low costs for \nland lease; and (viii) competitive costs for labor and inputs. To take advantage of global demand \nand its enormous potential, Lao PDR needs to develop the plantations subsector efficiently. \n \nFollowing  completion  of  TA  3794\u2013LAO12  in  March  2003,  it  became  evident  that  new \n25. \ninstitutional  arrangements  would  be  needed  to  overcome  constraints  that  contributed  to  the \nunsatisfactory  performance  of  the  majority  of  plantations  established  under  ITPP.  It  was \nrecognized  that  a  new  institution  had  to  be  established  to  develop  a  vibrant  plantations \nsubsector  in  Lao  PDR.  Based  on  the  successful  experiences  of  regional  countries,  ADB \nproposed  to  set  up  the  Lao  Plantation  Authority  (LPA).13  To  further  explore  the  options  of \ninstitutional  and  subsector  development,  the  Government  set  up  an  Interministerial  Working \nGroup  (IWG)  in  May  2004  comprising  high-ranking  officials  from  11  line  agencies.  To  better \nunderstand \nin \nthe  region, \nthree  countries \nNovember 2004,  ADB  organized  a  regional  study \n(i.e., Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand).  Many  public  organizations,  in  tandem  with  private \ncompanies, have successfully supported livelihood, enterprise, and industrial plantations in the \nregion.  Their  models  have  a  variety  of  institutional  structures  but  most  have  autonomous  or \nsemiautonomous management. During the regional study tour, IWG closely observed a variety \nof  institutions  and  management  models  to  determine  which  was  suitable  for  Lao  PDR.  It  was \nmost impressed by FELDA of Malaysia. \n \nTo tap the significant potential of this subsector, there is a need to create additional staff \n26. \nas  well  as  institutional  capacity  within  the  Government.  The  existing  institutions  are  not \nadequately  staffed  and  do  not  have  the  necessary  skills  and  experience  to  develop  this \n\ninstitutions  and  corporate  models \n\nthe  relevant  existing \n\nin \nto \n\nIWG \n\ntour \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n10  Average  rainfall  ranges  from  1,800  millimeters  per  year  (mm/year)  to  3,000  mm/year  in  most  of  the  central  and \n\nsouthern provinces, areas suitable for large industrial plantations. \n\n11  Population  density,  at  16/km2  in  the  same  provinces,  is  much  less  than  in  neighboring  countries,  i.e.,  69/km2  in \n\nCambodia, 120/km2  in Thailand, and 244/km2 in Viet Nam. \n\n12  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  Preparing  the  Tree  Plantation  for \n\nLivelihood Improvement Project. Manila. (TA\u20133794). \n\n13 Initially, ADB proposed to set up two separate organizations. One, Lao Plantation Development Corporation, was \nconceived to provide a full-package service to small livelihood plantations. The other, Lao Forest Authority, was to \nfacilitate  the  operations  of  multinational  plantation  companies  by  providing  them  with  one-window  service.  There \nare advantages in separating these functions in two organizations. But it would involve some duplication of staff as \nwell as functions. There was also a risk that disagreement or misunderstanding between two organizations could \nlead to confusion. It was, therefore, considered appropriate to set up one organization, which would be structured \nto provide requisite services to both sets of clients. \n\n\f8 \n\nsubsector.  Given  the  tangible  interest  of  multinational  companies  and  growing  demand  for \nwood, pulp, and paper in world markets, there is an acute need to create such capacity in Lao \nPDR. It is imperative that LPA be set up as a semiautonomous institution to carry out a variety \nof  functions  smoothly,  by  engaging  skilled  and  motivated  staff  at  competitive  compensation \npackages. Since LPA is designed to provide full-package service to livelihood planters, it would \nfinance  plantation  establishment  with  equity-sharing  investment  rather  than  term  loans.  This \nfinancing  arrangement  will  not  require  cumbersome  credit  lines,  interim  interest  payments,  or \nsubsidies. LPA\u2019s livelihood plantation operations will be financially viable. \n \n27. \nThe  Government  also  needs  an  institution  to  provide  efficient  one-window  service  to \nmultinational companies keen to make FDI in this subsector. The Government has empowered \nits  Department  of  Domestic  and  Foreign  Investment  (DDFI),  under  the  Committee  for \nInvestment and Cooperation, to appraise investment applications in cooperation with agencies \nconcerned.14  But  neither  DDFI  nor  MAF  has  the  capacity  to  deal  with  the  kind  of  issues  and \nprocesses  that  would  facilitate  efficient  entry  of  multinational  companies  in  this  subsector.  For \ninstance,  the  existing  institutions  do  not  have  adequate  capacity  for  major  tasks  such  as: \n(i) survey for land-use planning; (ii) negotiations for LLA; (iii) development of technical, financial, \nenvironmental, and social standards and their compliance; and (iv) check for due diligence on \ninvestors. Without such capacity, the transaction cost of establishing industrial plantations and \nassociated  processing  industry  would  be  high,  making  the  subsector  unattractive  for  national \nand foreign investors. The problem-tree analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n28. \nThe impact of the Project will contribute to steady economic growth, accelerated poverty \nreduction,  and  improved  environmental  conservation.  The  immediate  Project  objective  is  to \ndevelop  an  efficient  and  equitable  forest  plantations  subsector  by:  (i)  establishing  a \nsemiautonomous,  sustainable,  and  efficient  new  institution  to  support  the  development  of  this \nsubsector;  and  (ii)  supporting  financially  viable  livelihood  and  enterprise  plantations,  and \nfacilitating  the  establishment  of  industrial  plantations  and  the  associated  processing  industry. \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by generating income and employment, creating \nassets for poor households, and raising considerable revenues for the Government. The Project \nwill  create  a  substantial  plantation  resource  base  and  catalyze  large-scale  FDI  in  forest \nplantations,  leading  to  the  development  of  a  modern  wood  processing  industry  in  the  medium \nterm.  Plantations  will  be  established  on  degraded  forestlands  (DFL)  that  have  little  or  no \nalternative economic value. The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n29. \nTo meet its objective, the Project will establish LPA as a semiautonomous, sustainable, \nand  efficient  new  institution,  within  MAF,  to  support  development  of  the  subsector.  LPA\u2019s \nbusiness  plan  will  comprise  four  activities:  (i)  undertake  land-use  planning;  (ii)  support  SLPs; \n(iii) facilitate  operations  of  LIPs;  and  (iv)  promote  plantation  enterprise  development  by \nsupporting  medium  enterprise  plantations  (MEPs)  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs).  The  first  activity,  land-use  planning,  is  the  key  to  the  success  of  subsector \n\n                                                 \n14  DDFI is empowered under the Law on the Promotion and Management of Domestic and Foreign Investment in the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  1994.  DDFI  is  the  former  Permanent  Office  of  the  Foreign  Investment \nManagement Committee. It was commonly known by its acronym FIMC.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\ndevelopment.  The  second  activity,  with  the  bulk  of  project  investments,  will  establish  SLPs  by \nproviding them full-package service. The third activity will facilitate the entry of multinational pulp \nand  paper  companies  in  this  subsector  to  establish  LIPs  following  sustainable  environmental \nand  participatory  social  standards,  policies,  and  laws.  The  fourth  activity  will  support  the \ndevelopment of MEPs and the associated SMEs through partial project financing and TA. The \nestablishment  of  LPA  will  create  adequate  staff  and  institutional  capacity  to  start  efficient  and \nequitable development of this subsector and tap its considerable potential. \n \nProject Scope. One of the main reasons ITPP was not able to provide effective support \n30. \nto planters was that its scope was spread too thinly over seven provinces. Under this Project, \nSLPs  will  be  established  in  three  clusters  of  about  3,000\u20133,500  ha  each  in  four  provinces, \ni.e., Vientiane  Capital,  Bolikhamxay,  Saravane,  and  Champasack,  covering  9,500  ha.  These \nthree  SLP  clusters  will  be  established  within  a  25\u201330  km  radius  with  one  nursery,  extension \nsupport, and research and development center for each. Such clusters would provide a critical \nmass  of  plantations  within  financially  viable  proximity.  Therefore,  LPA  will  be  able  to  provide \neffective support for training and marketing and supplying planting and protection material. The \noutput  from  each  cluster  will  eventually  provide  enough  raw  materials  to  support  a  30,000  m3 \nper  annum  capacity  medium-density  fiberboard  plant  in  the  vicinity.  Such  investments  in  the \nprocessing  industry  will  follow  after  raw  material  supplies  have  been  ensured.  These  clusters, \ntherefore,  will  turn  out  to  be  efficient  economic  zones  creating  new  business  opportunities  for \nupstream  and  downstream  businesses.  The  site  selection  criteria  and  plantation  development \nstrategy are in Appendix 4. \n \n31. \nSupport  for  livelihood  and  enterprise  plantations  in  two  other  provinces  (Khammuane \nand  Savannakhet)  will  be  arranged  through  LIPs  under  the  company-community  model.  The \nimpending  start  of  LIP  development  in  these  provinces  will  open  opportunities  for  SLPs  to  be \ndeveloped on the periphery of LIPs. Large plantation companies often provide training, planting \nmaterial, and offer buy-back contracts to such communities in the vicinity of their operations in \nmany  countries  (Indonesia,  Brazil,  Chile,  etc.).  LPA  will  develop  such  models  in  detail  and \nfacilitate their implementation. \n \n32. \nLao  Plantation  Authority.  LPA  will  be  set  up  through  a  prime  ministerial  decree  as  a \nsemiautonomous body empowered to: (i) engage qualified staff at competitive salary packages \nset by itself; (ii) open and operate an imprest account(s), in foreign as well as local currencies, \nto  manage  grant  and  loan  funds  from  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Malaysia;  (iii)  open  and \noperate corporate bank accounts, in foreign as well as local currencies, to manage its finances; \n(iv)  be  financially  viable  and  charge  for  services  rendered;  (v)  establish  SLPs  through  equity-\nsharing  financing  arrangements;  (vi)  recalibrate  and  refine  its  overall  business  and  equity-\nsharing models from time to time as may be deemed necessary due to changing circumstances; \n(vii) operate a revolving fund to support SLPs on continuing basis; and (viii) negotiate LLAs with \nLIPs on behalf of the Government. A detailed model of LPA has been prepared that describes \nits  mission,  structure,  mandate,  duties,  powers  and  rights,  staffing,  business  model,  scope  of \nwork, operational costs, revenues, and cash flow (Supplementary Appendix A). LPA will provide \nfull-package service to SLPs and MEPs and one-window service to LIPs. \n \n33. \nLand-Use Planning. Identifying suitable DFL for all types and sizes of plantations will be \nthe  first,  and  an  important,  activity  of  LPA.  It  is  critical  that  SLPs  are  established  within \nfinancially  viable  clusters  where  support  for  input  supply,  extension,  and  marketing  is  cost-\n\n\f10 \n\neffective.  Due  to  the  bulky  nature  of  its  output,  haulage  costs  are  high.15  Therefore,  it  is \nimperative to develop the subsector in such a way that critical mass is created in a few selected \nsuitable  areas.  Initial  screening  for  suitable  lands,  for  all  three  types  and  sizes  of  plantations, \nhas already been completed. A GIS-based plantation atlas has been prepared that will be made \navailable to all interested stakeholders on the Project\u2019s web site. Three SLP clusters, in seven \ndistricts  of Vientiane  Capital,  Bolikhamxay,  Saravane,  and  Champasack  provinces,  have  been \nidentified during project preparation (Appendix 4). LPA will undertake more detailed participatory \nland  surveys  to  precisely  delineate  (25\u201350  ha)  blocks  of  plantation  land  in  each  village \nemploying  GPS  techniques,  and  testing  soils  for  suitability  following  social  and  environmental \ncriteria.  LPA  will  identify  suitable  lands  for  LIPs  (mainly  in  Khammuane  and  Savannakhet \nprovinces) and MEPs, following a similar procedure. LPA will ensure that lands earmarked for \nforest plantations do not entail better alternative economic uses. \n \n34. \nSmall  Livelihood  Plantations.  This  activity  will  support  the  establishment  of  SLPs  to \nimprove  the  livelihood  of  poor  households  in  the  three  target  clusters.  The  aim  is  to  support \naround 2,000 households in establishing financially viable plantations on 9,500 ha by providing \na  full-package  service  through  an  equity-sharing  financing  model.  Each  household  will  be \nallocated on average 3\u20135 ha in blocks of 25\u201350 ha in the vicinity of their village. Land allocation \nwill  depend  on  labor  availability  and  other  economic  activities  of  each  household.  LPA  will \nidentify qualified poor households following prescribed criteria and arrange for TLUCs following \nprevailing  Government  regulations,  in  consultation  with  the  relevant  local  authorities.  Planters \nwill  be  explained  the  full  details  of  the  equity-sharing  financing  model,  training  program, \nconcepts of clusters, and marketing support. Planters will be grouped according to their blocks \nto receive effective support from LPA and exchange information and help each other. \n \n35. \nLarge  Industrial  Plantations.  The  private  sector  consultation  workshop,  organized  by \nthe  Government  with  assistance  from  ADB  in  Vientiane  in  August  2004,  turned  out  to  be  a \nwatershed  in  the  plantation  development  subsector  in  Lao  PDR.  This  was  the  first  occasion \nwhen  multinational  pulp  and  paper  companies  were  formally  introduced  to  the  significant \npotential  of  this  subsector  in  the  country  and  they  also  interacted  with  high-level  Government \nofficials.  Since  then,  Oji  Paper  Company  of  Japan  has  acquired  BGA  Lao  Plantation,  Ltd;16 \nPhoenix  Pulp  and  Paper  Company  of  Thailand  has  identified  12,000  ha  for  plantations  in \nSavannakhet province; Advance Agro Pulp and Paper, Ltd of Thailand has requested another \n20,000 ha for plantations in Savannakhet province; Aditya Birla Group of India\u2019s Pulp and Fiber \nBusiness has identified 50,000 ha in Savannakhet and Khammuane provinces with an option to \nset  up  a  pulp  fiber  plant  (total  investment  of  about  $350  million).17  There  are  indications  that \nmore such companies are on the way to explore opportunities in Lao PDR. It is anticipated that, \nby  2011,  LIPs  will  have  been  established  on  at  least  70,000  ha.  Such  strong  expression  of \ninterest  from  multinational  pulp  and  paper  companies  now  provides  the  Government  with  a \nwindow of opportunity to entice significant FDI in this subsector. \n \n36. \nLPA  will  facilitate  the  entry  of  these  firms  in  this  subsector  by  providing  one-window \nservice, streamlining currently cumbersome procedures for obtaining all necessary licenses and \npermits.  LPA  will  undertake  due  diligence  of  potential  investors  to  ensure  that  companies \n\n                                                 \n15 Average transport costs by trailer-trucks are about $0.07/ton/km. If the average roadside price near the plantation \nis $13.5/tonne (m3), a 20-tonne load (valued $270) will cost $280 to deliver to a processing plant 200 km away. So, \ntransport costs could be higher than the value of output if distance to market is long.  \n\n16  BGA Ltd was set up in 1996 by a consortium of foreign investors (mostly from New Zealand); the Government has \n15% share in the company. BGA was granted a land concession over 150,000 ha (about 50,000 ha plantable area) \nin Bolikhamxay and Khammuane provinces. However, to date, it has planted only 1,700 ha due mainly to lack of \ncapital. Most of its plantations have been established with a line of credit from ITPP (footnote 4). \n17  Aditya Birla Group made a formal presentation to the Government on 11 March 2005 in Vientiane. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\ninvesting  in  the  subsector  meet  the  highest  international  standards.  Where  appropriate  and \nrequested, ADB will provide a political risk guarantee (PRG) facility to qualified investors so that \nthey  may  obtain  investment  funds  at  competitive  rates  in  international  capital  markets \n(Appendix 5). LPA will identify suitable lands and negotiate LLAs with LIP companies. LPA will \narrange for third party audits of LIP operations to ensure that they comply with technical, social, \nenvironmental, and financial standards and regulations. \n \n37. \nPlantation  Enterprise  Development.  LPA  will  provide  support  for  MEPs  and  SMEs. \nQualified  MEPs  (average  size  50\u2013100  ha)  will  be  provided  technical,  financial,  and  marketing \nsupport. LPA will assist MEPs to raise most of their financing requirements from local banks by \ndesigning full-term loans. LPA will provide up to 20% ($200/ha) of the requisite financing\u2014on an \nequity-sharing basis\u2014for qualified MEPs covering a total area of about 1,000 ha. The objective \nis to demonstrate a financially viable model that can be jointly supported by LPA and the local \nbanks.  LPA  will  also  support  the  development  of  associated  SMEs,  i.e.,  charcoal  making, \nsawmilling,  flooring,  and  furniture  manufacturing.  Such  value  adding  operations  present \nsignificant opportunities to generate employment and raise efficiencies to current practices.18 TA \nwill  be  provided  to  about  10  SMEs  to  develop  promising  business  proposals  and  feasibility \nstudies. LPA will assist SMEs to generate financing from local banks. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Livelihood Improvement \n\n \n38. \nThe  Government  considers  a  person  as  poor  if  one  does  not  have  access  to \n2,100 kilocalories per day, which is roughly the equivalent of an income of $10.25 per capita per \nmonth  in  current  prices.19  The  rural  poverty  line  is  considered  15\u201320%  lower  than  the  urban \npoverty line. In the target provinces, poverty rates range from 30\u201340%, which is about the same \nas  the  national  average  of  39%.  Women  also  suffer  from  poverty  in  gender-specific  ways. \nPoverty for women means having a greater work burden, poorer health, lower education levels, \nless  food,  and  inadequate  rest  than  men.  Dependency  ratios  are  high,  implying  that  large \nfamilies are part of strategies to deal with poverty for poor households. Chronic food shortages \nare  common:  rice  shortages  for  3\u20135  months  were  reported  during  participatory  rural \nassessments. The main causes of food shortages are: (i) reduced access to productive land, (ii) \nlack  of  forest  resources,  and  (iii) inadequate  income  from  NTFPs.  Land  and  forest  allocations \nwere  stated  to  be  unfair  to  the  poor.  Unemployment  and  underemployment  rates  among  poor \nhouseholds  are  as  high  as  50%.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n39. \nThe Project will address the primary concerns of the poor, generating employment with \ncash  income,  providing  sustainable  livelihoods,  and  creating  assets  in  the  form  of  productive \nplantation  land.  LPA  will  facilitate  access  to  TLUCs  for  poor  households.  The  Government \nissues  TLUCs  on  a  3-year  rolling  basis.  After  the  initial  3  years,  according  to  this  policy,  if  a \nTLUC  holder  is  determined  to  have  put  the  land  under  productive  use,  TLUCs  can  be  turned \n\n                                                 \n18  The  local/traditional  charcoal-making  process,  using  earthen  pits,  is  quite  inefficient  with  a  conversion  rate  of \n<10%. LPA could introduce modern yet simple steel kilns that would improve the conversion rates to >25%. LPA \nmay set up and lease 2\u20133 units for on-farm demonstration on strategic locations. \n\n19  Based  on  the  Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  III  (2001),  the  food  poverty  line  in  rural  areas  was \nKN80,000  per  person  per  month  ($9  at  2001  exchange  rate).  In  today\u2019s  terms,  it  is  $10.25.  This  implies  that  a \nfamily of six should have an income of at least $61.5 per month ($738 per year) to stay above the food poverty line. \nThe value of paddy produced by an average household is $416 (assuming average landholding of 1 ha yielding 3t \npaddy valued at KN1,500 per kilogram) and cash income is $150 per year. Therefore, the total annual income of \nthe average household ($566) is still short by $172 of the food poverty line ($738 per year). The rural poor make up \nthis shortfall by harvesting mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fish, and some game from nearby forests. \n\n\f12 \n\ninto a permanent land deed. This often does not occur because Government institutions do not \nhave the capacity to survey and certify land use. LPA will establish and maintain a land registry \nand facilitate the implementation of this government policy to turn TLUCs into LUCs at the end \nof first rotation, for participants who have established their credentials as serious planters. The \ntime lag is necessary to discourage land-grabbing tendencies of unscrupulous planters. In each \nvillage,  planters  will  be  organized  into  groups  of  20  households  so  they  can  access  better \nplantation technologies through appropriate and inclusive training and extension services. Land \nallocations will be carried out in full consultation with poor communities. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Management \n\n40. \nThe  ITPP  PCR  noted  that  Eucalyptus  plantations  have  not  demonstrated  any  adverse \nimpact on the environment. The plantation area to date has been a small portion of the overall \nforested  area  in  these  localities  (a  mere  0.5\u20135.0%)  and  this  ratio  will  not  change  significantly \neven  when  LIPs  are  established.  Given  the  amount  of  land  and  land-use  patterns,  forest \nplantations, in terms of area coverage, will remain a modest part of the overall land-use pattern \n(<10%) in Lao PDR. \n \n41.  Monoculture  plantations,  if  not  managed  properly,  can  cause  harm  to  soil,  water,  flora, \nand  fauna.  The  Project\u2019s  plantation  design,  development,  and  management  arrangements \nrecognize the potential environmental issues associated with large-scale eucalyptus plantations. \nThese include: (i) water use and quality; (ii) soil fertility; and (iii) pests, diseases, and fire risks. \nHowever,  the  conditions  in  Lao  PDR  generally,  and  in  the  Project  area  specifically,  do  not \nwarrant  cause  for  concern.  Rainfall  in  the  Project  area  is  1,800\u20133,000  millimeters  (mm)  per \nyear.  This  level  of  precipitation  is  more  than  adequate  to  support  Eucalyptus  plantations, \nespecially when their density will be <10% of the overall land-use mosaic. Therefore, there is no \nrisk  of  water  shortages  and/or  lowering  of  water  tables.  Furthermore,  plantation  site  selection, \ndesign  and  management  principles,  and  standards  outlined  in  the  LPA\u2019s  Operations  Manual \n(Supplementary  Appendix  C)  are  consistent  with  internationally  recognized  forest  plantation \ncertification  systems  and  technical  standards  and  guidelines  that  will  ensure  sustainable \nenvironmental management. These safeguards will effectively prevent and mitigate associated \nrisks. LPA will have the requisite capacity to facilitate the enforcement of relevant standards and \nregulations  by  organizing  third  party  audits.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nStakeholder Consultation \n\n3. \nDuring  the  implementation  of  the  TA  3794\u2013LAO20  (October  2002  to  April  2003), \n42. \nenvironmental impact assessment and resettlement planning consultations were carried out with \nGovernment  agencies,  provincial  departments,  civil  society  organizations, \nlocal  mass \norganizations,  and  potential  beneficiaries.  Two  workshops  and  a  number  of  meetings  in  four \nvillages were organized to seek views from these stakeholders. After the new Project concepts \nwere  developed  in  August  2003,  similar  consultations  were  held  to  seek  their  views  again.  A \nprivate  sector  consultation  workshop  was  organized  in  August  2004,  in  which  all  relevant  line \nagencies,  provincial  departments,  international  civil  society  organizations,  and  local  and \ninternational  private  sector  companies  participated  and  supported  the  new  Project  concepts. \nADB  consultation  missions  in  the  intervening  period  regularly  visited  the  Project  areas  and \ncarried  out  village  consultations  with  potential  beneficiaries  to  seek  their  views  on  the  equity-\nsharing  financing  model.  Consultants  under  the  small-scale  technical  assistance,  TA  4419\u2013\n\n                                                 \n20  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  Preparing  the  Tree  Plantation  for \n\nLivelihood Improvement Project. Manila. (TA\u20133794) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nLAO,21  have  also  undertaken  two  surveys  during  2004  and  2005  to  assess  land-use  patterns \nusing  GIS  maps.  A  more  formal  and  updated  social  and  environmental  impact  survey  was \nundertaken  in  July  2005.  The  survey  team  visited  15  villages  in  3  proposed  clusters  and  held \ndetailed discussions with provincial, district, and village officials, along with villagers. More than \n1,200  villagers  participated  in  these  meetings.  Data  and  information  in  the  resettlement \nframework,  ethnic  minorities  development  framework,  and  gender  action  plan  have  been \nupdated based on survey results. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n43. \nThe  Project  cost,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties  is  estimated  at  $15.35 \nmillion  equivalent,  consisting  of  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $6.45 million  (42%)  and  local \ncurrency costs of $8.90 million (58%). Detailed cost estimates are in Table A7.1, Appendix 7. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n44. \nThe  Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  requested  loan  of  $7.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources and a grant of $3.0 million from the Asian Development Fund to help finance \nthe  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The \nADB grant will be used to support the establishment and bulk of the initial working capital of LPA \nduring  the  Project  period.  The  Government  of  Malaysia  will  provide  $652,000  equivalent  in \nparallel  grant  financing.22  The  Government  will  contribute  $2.12  million,  including  the  imputed \nvalue  of  land  rents  for  SLPs,  and  taxes  and  duties.  The  beneficiaries  will  make  in-kind \ncontribution of $2.29 million. A detailed financing plan is in Table A7.2, Appendix 7. ADB grant \nrationale and purpose are described in Appendix 8. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n45.  MAF  will  be  the  executing  agency  pending  formal  establishment  of  LPA  following \napproval of LPA decree. Once operational, LPA will be the executing agency. LPA will have a \nboard of directors (BOD), a high-ranking Government official as its managing director (MD), and \na  professional  chief  technical  advisor  (CTA).  Its  operations  will  be  divided  into  four  divisions, \nnine units, and one office. Each division will be headed by a director. Livelihood and Industrial \nPlantations  are  operational  divisions,  while  Land-use  Survey  and  Finance  and  Human \nResources  are  support  divisions.  The  Public  Relations  Office  is  attached  to  the  CTA\u2019s  office. \nLPA\u2019s structure, functions, list of staff, and their inputs are described in Appendix 9. \n \n46. \nAs a semiautonomous agency, its BOD will be empowered by the Government, through \na  prime  ministerial  decree,  to  implement  LPA\u2019s  mandate.  BOD  will  approve  LPA:  (i)  staff \nappointments; (ii) quarterly, annual, and long-term work plans; (iii) annual budget and revenue \nmanagement  plan;  (iv)  negotiated  land-lease  agreements  for  enterprise  and  industrial \nplantations;  and  (v)  business  proposals  for  setting  up  processing  industries.  More  detailed \nfunctions,  operating  procedures,  and  conduct  of  business  of  BOD  are  provided  in  the  prime \nministerial decree (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n22  The  grant  proposal  is  under  consideration  by  the  Government  of  Malaysia.  If  it  does  not  materialize,  an  equal \n\namount from the loan will be allocated to bridge the gap in financing.  \n\n\f14 \n\nBOD will be chaired by the Vice Minister of MAF. Other relevant line agencies would be \n47. \nrepresented  by  a  deputy  director  general  or  a  higher  level  official.  Provincial  governor(s) \nconcerned would be member(s) of BOD as and when a project of that particular province(s) will \nbe  discussed  or  decided  upon.  BOD  will  also  have  one  member  each  from  the  Lao  private \nsector,  and  an  industry/subsector  expert.  BOD  would  ensure  that  LPA  is  managed  efficiently \nand  transparently.  It  will  appoint  third  party  auditors  to  ensure  compliance  with  financial, \nenvironmental,  and  social  policies,  standards,  laws,  and  regulations  of  the  Government.  Its \nmembers would disclose conflict of interest in matters under consideration by BOD, if any, and \nwould not be party to or influence such decisions. BOD will comprise the following members: \n \n\nVice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry (Chairperson); \nVice Minister of Finance (Vice Chairperson); \nManaging Director, Lao Plantation Authority (Secretary); \nDeputy Director General, National Land Development Agency \nDeputy Director General, Ministry of Foreign Affairs; \nDeputy Director General, Ministry of Industries and Handicrafts; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  Deputy Director General, Ministry of Commerce; \n(viii)  Deputy Director General, Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Posts; \n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n(xiii)  One member from Lao Chamber of Commerce; and \n(xiv)  A subsector and/or industry expert. \n\nDeputy Director General, Committee for Planning and Investment; \nDeputy Director General, Science, Technology and Environment Agency; \nDeputy Director General, Lao Women\u2019s Union; \nProvincial governor(s) concerned; \n\n \nThe  MD  and  CTA  will  be  appointed  by  BOD.  The  MD  will:  (i)  liaise  with  BOD,  line \n48. \nagencies,  provinces,  and  CTA  to  facilitate  the  political  decision-making  process;  (ii)  represent \nLPA in international forums, i.e., trade fairs, conferences, company and industry meetings; and \n(iii)  represent  the  Government  to  promote  opportunities  of  investment  in  plantations  and \nassociated  processing  industries  in  the  country.  The  CTA  will:  (i)  implement  LPA\u2019s  day-to-day \nfunctions; (ii) prepare corporate work and financial plans, and annual budget for BOD approval; \n(iii)  prepare  progress  reports  and  technical  standards;  and  (iv)  inspire  and  provide  on-the-job \ntraining to LPA\u2019s Lao staff to ensure high standards of service and good morale. \n \n\n2. \n\nStaffing \n\n49. \nAt full strength by year-3, LPA will have a total of 62 part- and full-time employees. LPA \nwill  be  staffed  in  stages,  based  on  its  work  progress,  during  the  first  12\u201318  months  after  its \ninception. Initially, an interim-CTA (iCTA) will be recruited for about 6 months, and delegated the \nresponsibility to set up office, process initial procurements, and search and shortlist candidates \nfor  the  tenured  CTA  position  and  LPA  staff.  All  staff  positions  will  be  filled  with  qualified \nindividuals,  as  defined  against  each  position,  following  a  transparent  process.  The  iCTA/CTA \nwill  search,  shortlist,  interview,  and  select  staff.  BOD  will  approve  the  recruitment  of  selected \ncandidate(s) after LPA receives concurrence from ADB. \n \nFour  internationally  recruited  experts  (180  person-months)  will  be  engaged.  The \n50. \niCTA/CTA  will  be  offered  a  competitive  package,  comparable  to  those  provided  by  similar \nprivate sector multinationals and development agencies. Three experts to support the director, \nLand  Survey  Division  (LSD);  director,  Finance  and  Human  Resources  Division  (FHD);  and \ndirector,  Livelihood  Plantation  Division  will  be  seconded  by  the  Government  of  Malaysia  from \nFELDA  or  similar  organizations  in  Malaysia.  ADB  will  finance  their  allowances  from  its  grant. \nThe 35 nationally recruited professional staff (2,520 person-months) and 24 support staff (1,728 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nperson-months)  will  be  offered  employment  packages  comparable  to  those  provided  by \nmultinational companies operating in Lao PDR, in order to attract and retain highly skilled staff. \nLao  staff  will  also  be  offered  performance-based  bonuses.  All  short-listed  candidates  for \nmanagement  and  professional  staff  positions  will  be  evaluated  by  the  Staff  Selection \nCommittee, comprising one representative each from the Government (MD, LPA), ADB, and the \nGovernment of Malaysia. A detailed list of staff is in Appendix 9. \n \n51. \nSuitably  qualified  Lao  nationals  will  be  engaged  as  directors  of  divisions  and  will  work \nunder the supervision of respective international experts and iCTA/CTA. On-the-job training will \nbe  provided  to  these  staff  to  take  on  the  responsibilities  in  the  near  future,  i.e.,  3\u20134 years, \nwithout  supervision.  The  expert  and  director  of  FHD  will  develop  a  staff  transition  plan  at  the \noutset  to  include  the  necessary  training  for  Lao  staff  to  take  on  responsibilities  performed  by \ninternational experts. The duration of the international experts will be largely determined by the \namount  of  time  needed  for  Lao  staff  to  achieve  the  necessary  qualifications,  skills,  and \nexperience.  But  the  iCTA/CTA  will  be  recruited  for  the  full  6-year  Project  period.  The  three \nexperts will be seconded for a total of 36 person-months each; full-time for the first 24 months \nand 3 person-months input per year for the next 4 years. Services of short-term consultants for \na  total  of  12 person-months  will  also  be  provided  to  LPA.  They  will  be  engaged  periodically \nbased  on  specific  needs.  LPA  will  prepare  a  request  justifying  the  need,  along  with  terms  of \nreference  for  ADB  concurrence,  before  engaging  any  short-term  consultant.  The  requisite  job \ndescriptions  and  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  LPA  staff  are  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n52. \nThe  implementation  period  will  be  6  years  (2006\u20132011).  Most  of  the  first  year  will  be \nspent  on  establishing  LPA,  i.e.,  setting  up  the  office,  recruiting  necessary  staff,  establishing \nthree  nurseries,  and  undertaking  land-use  planning  and  planter  training  for  the  first  batch  of \n500 ha  for  SLPs.  Substantive  operations  will  start  from  the  middle  of  the  second  year  of  LPA \noperations.  It  is  recognized  that  new  institutions  evolve  slowly,  so  the  start-up  activities \nenvisaged  have  been  allocated  a  reasonable  amount  of  time.  However,  delays  in  actual \nimplementation  due \nto  unforeseen  circumstances  must  be  addressed  during  project \nimplementation  and  the  project  schedule  should  be  adjusted  accordingly.  The  sequence  of \nactivities  ensures  that  no  project  investments  will  be  made  in  plantations  until  adequate \npreparatory  steps  have  been  taken  to:  (i)  engage  appropriate  staff,  (ii)  undertake  participatory \nland-use  planning,  (iii)  set  up  nurseries  of  desired  quality,  and  (iv)  train  participating  planters. \nThe indicative project management and implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n53. \nGoods  and  services  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  civil  works,  and \nmaterials will be procured by international competitive bidding where the cost is valued at more \nthan $500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is valued from $100,000 \nto  $500,000  equivalent.  Where  several  local  suppliers  can  offer  satisfactory  service  facilities, \nthen  vehicles,  equipment,  civil  works,  and  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent \nmay be procured under local competitive bidding procedures, or through direct purchase. Final \ndetails  for  procurement  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation  as  appropriate.  To \ncommence the Project on time, ADB has approved, at the Government\u2019s request, an advance \naction  for  procurement.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  such  advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n\n\f16 \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n54. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  MAF. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. In discussion with the MAF, attention was drawn to the \nsection  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, contractors, \nand  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethnics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-\nfinanced contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. The Project design \nhas provisions for funds for independent and external auditors. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n55. \nLPA, under its charter approved by the prime ministerial decree, will establish a Project \nimprest  account.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2001).  The  initial  combined  total  amount  in  the  imprest  account  will \nnot exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and not more than 10% of the loan and grant \namounts.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be \nto  reimburse \nexpenditures and liquidate imprest accounts for payments below the ceiling of $50,000. \n \n\nfollowed \n\n7. \n\nFinancial Management, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56. \nFinancial Management. LPA will be a non-profit entity. The bulk of its investments will \nbe  made  in  SLPs  (about  85%  of  ADB  loan  amount)  and  a  modest  investment  in  MEPs \n(about 3%).  The  Government  will  pass  on  ADB\u2019s  loan  to  LPA  as  grant.  LPA\u2019s  investments  in \nboth SLPs and MEPs will be on an equity-sharing basis; all parties will bear risk and share profit \nand  loss  proportionately.23  LPA  will  set  up  a  revolving  fund  to  reinvest  its  recovered  equity  in \nmore SLPs and MEPs, following the same model and conditions. Since these investments will \nbe  made  on  an  equity-sharing  basis,  there  is  no  relending  rate.  All  LPA  investments  are \ndesigned  to  be  financially  viable.  Since  LPA  will  be  a  non-profit  entity  which  would  be \nreinvesting  recovered  equity  in  more  SLPs  and  MEPs,  passing  Project  funds  from  the \nGovernment to LPA as grant is justified. \n \n57. \nRevenue  Management.  The  Government  will  collect  land  rents  from  LIPs.  LPA  will \nnegotiate land-lease agreements, including land rents, with private sector investors on behalf of \nthe  Government.  Land  rents  will  constitute  two  accounts:  land  lease  fee  (LLF)  and  land \nmanagement fee (LMF). LLF, as economic return of land\u2019s productivity, will be deposited in the \ntreasury  as  Government  revenue.  While  LPA  will  be  authorized  to  receive  LMF,  through \nbudgetary  allocation,  as  its  service  charge  to  cover  its  costs  of  land-use  planning,  plantation \nmanagement, and 3rd party audits. LPA will prepare a detailed revenue management plan within \nthe  first  year.  LPA\u2019s  annual  budget  will  reflect  projections  for  revenue  management  for  the \nfollowing year and its annual report will show revenue management for the preceding year. \n \n58. \nIncome and Financial Sustainability. LPA will be fully funded during its 6-year Project \nperiod  from  ADB  loan  and  grant  and  by  GOM  grant  technical  assistance  but  it  will  become \n\n                                                 \n23 More details on proportion of equity and risk-sharing are provided in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nfinancially self sustaining thereafter. It will have 3 sources of income: (i) revenues from products \nand services provided including seedling sales and commissions on materials and sales of logs; \n(iii) LMF collected as part of land rents from LIPs and MEPs; and (iii) a revolving fund created by \nits share of revenues from SLPs; \n \n59. \nAccounting. The FHD of LPA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received, \nproject  expenditures,  and  use  of  local  funds.  Accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  following  Ministry  of  Finance \nguidelines  and  procedures  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and \nrelated financial statements will be compiled by the FHD and audited annually by independent \nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, audit reports, and related financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to \nwhich they relate. \n \n60. \nAudit Reports. The FHD of LPA will prepare concise quarterly reports during each year \nof  implementation,  describing  (i)  physical  and  financial  progress  against  agreed  targets, \n(ii) disbursement  of  funds  at  provincial  and/or  district  levels,  and  (iii)  summary  of  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (PME)  results.  In  turn,  LPA  will  submit  consolidated  quarterly  and \ncomprehensive  annual  progress  reports  for  BOD  approval  and  onward  submission  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  LPA  will  prepare  a  project \ncompletion report in the standard ADB format and submit it to the Government, ADB, and GOM. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nPME  will  be  undertaken  for  each  component  to  ensure  that  Project  resources  are \n61. \nmanaged efficiently and benefits realized. The CTA will develop a comprehensive PME plan in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  The  PME  will \ninclude  a  participatory  mechanism  to  involve  beneficiaries  in  monitoring.  The  Livelihood \nPlantations  Division  (LPD)  and  Industrial  Plantations  Division  (IPD)  will  be  responsible  for \ncarrying out PME activities, including the establishment of benchmarks through initial baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  data  collection,  and  analysis.  LPA  will  submit  a  detailed \nPME implementation plan to prepare benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. LPA will provide annual PME reports to ADB and GOM \nthroughout project implementation. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nDuring  project  implementation,  ADB  will  carry  out  annual  reviews  assessing  the \n62. \n(i) progress  of  LPA  development  and  its  effectiveness;  (ii)  capacity-building  activities  and \ntraining programs for LPA staff; and (iii) progress of SLPs, MEPs/SMEs, and LIPs. The first year \nof the Project may require more than one review mission(s). A midterm review will be carried out \nin  year-3.  The  review  will  take  a  comprehensive  stock  of  the  project  implementation  and \ndetermine  whether  it  complies  with  the  original  design  parameters  and  that  intended  benefits \nhave  begun  to  materialize.  The  midterm  review  will  also  give  an  opportunity  to  make  any \nrequisite refinements or realignments to the Project design. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\nThe Project\u2019s core investments in SLPs, MEPs, and SMEs will have significant impact on \n63. \nthe income of participating planters and entrepreneurs. Financially viable SLPs will create full-\ntime employment for the 2,000 participating households and more than double their annual cash \n\n\f18 \n\nincome within the first year\u2014from $150 to $384. A typical household with 5 ha allocation will be \npulled above the food poverty line with a constant stream of cash income from labor inputs on \ntheir  own  plantations  for  the  next  5  years  (footnote  19).  LPA  will  compensate  participating \nhouseholds for their labor inputs as part of its equity in SLP. From years 8\u201312, households will \nreceive on average over $858/ha/year income as its share of the revenues. These revenues will \nincrease  their  household  cash  income  by  five  times.  In  the  process,  SLPs  will  create  a \nresourceful  asset  for  poor  households,  who  will  receive  LUCs  after  year-8  (end  of  the  first \nrotation). Such an increase in income and asset creation will have significant impact not only on \npoverty reduction but also on the general well-being of the average household. With this level of \ncash  income,  the  household  will  be  able  to  afford  basic  education,  primary  health,  and  more \nnutritious  food.  The  multiplier  effect  on  the  village  economy,  with  more  opportunities  for  trade \nand  employment,  will  be  just  as  important.  The  socioeconomic  profile  of  participating  villages \ncould change dramatically within 8\u201310 years. More detailed financial and economic analysis is \nin Appendix 11. \n \n64. \nEven  if  only  half  the  expressions  of  interest  from  multinational  companies  materialize, \nthe pace of development in the forest plantations subsector would be significant. Conservative \nestimates show that as much as 150,000 ha may be under LIPs by 2015. This pace and scale \nof  development  would  create  massive  employment  opportunities\u2014even  10,000  ha/year \ndevelopment  will  create  one  million  person-days  of  employment.  This  situation  would  result  in \nlabor  shortages,  requiring  increasingly  mechanized  means  of  plantation  management.  This \ntransformation  would  result  in  higher  labor  wages,  jobs  with  better  skills,  higher  household \nincome, and a significant multiplier effect on the regional and national economy. \n \n65. \nIt  is  assumed  that  LIPs  will  launch  operations  from  2007  by  planting  about  2,000  ha \ngenerating  land  rent  of  $40,000.  This  estimate  assumes  land  rent  of  $20/ha/year,  which  is  a \nconservative forecast. At the assumed pace, by 2015, about 150,000 ha would be under LIPs \ngenerating land rents of $3 million per annum. This level of wood production would result in the \nestablishment of an active wood processing industry by the private sector manufacturing pulp, \nmedium density fiberboards, and sawlogs.24 \n\n \nB. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n66. \nBy  establishing  SLPs  on  about  9,500  ha,  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately \n2,000 poor households. Poverty levels of beneficiary households are high (39\u201353%), according \nto the Project Social Survey, 2005. SLPs will significantly increase household income, improve \nfood  security,  and  other  social  indicators  for  participating  households  and  communities. \nBeneficiary  involvement  in  Project  activities  will be  entirely  voluntary  and  undertaken  following \nparticipatory approaches. \n \n67. \nLPA  will  help  develop  three  main  types  of  plantations,  i.e.,  SLPs,  MEPs,  and  LIPs. \nThese plantations are likely to acquire and convert DFL to forest plantations. In that process, it \n\n                                                 \n24  Given  the  prevailing  corporate  tax  rate  of  20%,  the  processing  industry  would  start  generating  revenues  for  the \nGovernment  in  excess  of  $10  million  from  2016,  reaching  over  $40  million  by  2020.  This  level  of  growth  in  LIP \ndevelopment  and  associated  processing  industry  is  quite  conservative.  It  is  quite  likely  that,  by  2015,  LIPs  will \ncover about 300,000 ha with an investment of $300 million. LIPs are being planned by industrial processing firms. \nHaving  secured  this  level  of  woodchip  supplies,  these  firms  will  set  up  industrial  processing  plants  for  pulp  and \npaper,  medium  density  fiberboards,  and  many  other  products.  The  total  industrial  investment  may  exceed \n$1.5 billion, bringing combined investment in the subsector to over $2 billion considering the induced investment in \nup  and  down  stream  industries,  supply  chains,  transport,  and  a  variety  of  trade  to  service  this  level  of  industrial \nactivity. Government revenues in this scenario\u2014from corporate income and other taxes, profits from its own equity, \nand land rents\u2014could exceed $100 million a year. Assuming another, at least twofold multiplier effect, the impact \non  GDP  would  be  quite  considerable.  Value-adding  ratios  in  this  subsector  are  significant:  4  tons  of  woodchips \nworth about $100 produce one ton of pulp worth $500. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\ntechnical,  and  market \n\nis  likely  that  in  some  cases,  adverse  impacts  may  be  felt  in  the  short-run  by  current  users  of \nDFL. Given these risks, the Project has developed a draft Operations Manual (Supplementary \nAppendix  C);  to  address  safeguards  and  compliance  issues,  including  those  relating  to  ethnic \nminority  development  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  manual  is  in  line  with  the  agreed \nresettlement  framework;  government  policies  on  resettlement,  land-use  planning,  and  related \nlaws  and  policies;  and  ADB's  social  safeguard  policies.  The  draft  manual  will  be  submitted  to \nADB  for  approval  prior  to  its  use  by  LPA.  All  potential  investors  will  need  to  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies as well as related government laws and guidelines. \n \n68. \nEthnic minority households in Project areas will have the option to participate in the SLP \nprogram through participatory land-use planning. To address concerns regarding their ability to \nunderstand  the  SLP  concept\u2014including  the  equity-sharing  financing  model,  and  access  to \nrecruit  ethnic \ntraining,  extension, \nminority/community  development  officers.  The  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Framework \naddresses these issues in more detail (Supplementary Appendix F). After LPA identifies lands \nfor SLPs, MEPs, and LIPs, specific resettlement and ethnic minority development plans will be \nprepared  following  the  principles,  conditions,  and  procedures  outlined  in  the  frameworks \n(summarized in Appendix 12). \n \n69. \nPoor  women  and  women-headed  households  (less  than  10%  of  all  households  in  the \nProject area) will have equitable opportunities to participate and benefit from Project activities. \nThe  process  for  establishing  SLPs  will  provide  full  opportunities  for  women  to  participate  in \ndecision  making,  through  women\u2019s  focus  group  discussions,  and  the  inclusion  of  women\u2019s \nnames in all agreements between LPA and SLP beneficiaries. Similarly, all T/LUCs will be in the \njoint names of husbands and wives and, in the case of women-headed households, in women\u2019s \nnames.  LUCs  will  be  inheritable.  The  Gender  Action  Plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  F) \naddresses the need for women\u2014particularly ethnic minority women\u2014to get full access to LPA \nactivities. Under LIP, MEP, and SME development, all potential investors will need to agree to \nadhere to the Government\u2019s gender policies and the Gender Action Plan requirement to provide \nequitable access to women for employment, equal wages for equal work, and other benefits. \n \nC. \n\ninformation\u2014LPA  will \n\nProject Risks \n\n70. \nThe setting up of LPA and large-scale development of forest plantations subsector would \nentail  political,  institutional,  market,  business,  financial,  and  environmental  risks.  But  all  these \nrisks\u2014individually as well as collectively\u2014can be managed and mitigated. LPA would be able to \neffectively  mitigate  all  risks,  except  political  risk.  There  are  two  types  of  political  risks.  One \nwould be faced by LPA itself and the other by Lao PDR. To mitigate the risk faced by Lao PDR, \nADB could provide a political risk guarantee to qualified foreign investors. But mitigation of the \nLPA  risk  would  mainly  depend  on  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  allow  LPA  to  practice  its \nautonomy without interference. The Government will provide a commitment at the highest level \nby approving the prime ministerial decree establishing LPA. The Government has also provided \nspecific  assurances  that  have  been  covenanted  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  More  detailed \ndescription of risks and their mitigation measures is in Appendix 13. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given specific assurances \n\n71. \nthat have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n\n(i) \n\nAutonomy for LPA. The Government will grant semiautonomous status to LPA, \nthrough the prime ministerial decree, as envisaged in its model report. \n\n\f20 \n\n \nB. \n\n72. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nNon-interference  in  LPA  operations.  The  day-to-day  management  of  LPA \noperations  and  the  implementation  of  major  functions  will  rest  with  CTA.  The \nGovernment officials will facilitate its operations approved by its BOD as part of \nthe annual work plan.  \nStaff  recruitment  and  management.  The  staff  recruitment  process  will  be \ntransparent  and  competitive,  only  qualified  staff  will  be  engaged  as  per  the \nprescribed qualification criteria against each position. \nImplementation  of  social  actions.  LPA  and  all  investors  will  fully  adhere  to \nADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies  as  agreed  to  in  the  Resettlement  Framework, \nEthnic Minority Development Framework, and the Gender Action Plan. \n\nConditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n\nBefore loan and grant effectiveness:  \n\nPrime  ministerial  decree.  The  Government  will  have  approved  the  prime \nministerial decree establishing LPA as a semiautonomous agency.  \nLPA plans.

It analyzed project scope and design issues, summarized lessons learned from the ITPP, \nand prepared a detailed feasibility for the proposed investment project. An ADB mission visited \nLao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  from  19  June  to  4  July  2003  to  carry  out  fact-\nfinding  for  this  Project.3  The  mission  leader  then  proceeded  to  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and \nThailand  to  study  their  experiences  with  plantation  development  and  the  related  institutional \narrangements. Based on observations made in these three countries and lessons learned from \nITPP, in August 2003, the mission proposed modifications in the design of the new investment \nproject  and  proposed  to  set  up  new  institutions  to  develop  this  subsector.  The  Government \naccepted the mission\u2019s recommendations to explore alternative project designs. These concepts \nwere  well  received  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  In  March  2004,  the  mission  made  a  formal \npresentation of these concepts to Lao Deputy Prime Minister H. E. Somsavath Lengsavad, who \nencouraged  the  mission  to  develop  models  of  these  concepts.4  Further  detailed  analyses  on \nthese  aspects  and  stakeholder  consultation  were  undertaken  utilizing  the  remaining  TA \nresources (footnote 1). \n \nTo  assist  the  mission  in  this  endeavor,  the  Government  set  up  an  Interministerial \n2. \nWorking  Group  (IWG)  in  May  2004.  To  present  the  potential  investment  opportunities  to \nmultinational pulp and paper companies, the Government, with assistance from ADB, organized \nthe  Private  Sector  Consultation  Workshop  in  Vientiane  in  August  2004.  This  workshop  turned \nout to be a watershed in the development of this subsector. Oji Paper Company Ltd of Japan, \nintroduced to such opportunities in Lao PDR for the first time, was so convinced that it acquired \nBGA  Plantation  Company  Ltd  within  months.  Other  companies  (i.e.,  Phoenix  Pulp  and  Paper \nLtd. and Advance Agro Pulp and Paper, Ltd of Thailand; and Aditya Birla Group of India\u2019s Pulp \nand  Fiber  Business)  have  also  submitted  formal  expressions  of  interest  to  develop  large \nindustrial plantations and associated processing plants. \n \nIn October 2004, ADB approved a small-scale technical assistance, TA 4419\u2013LAO,5 to \n3. \nfurther  support  the  processing  of  this  Project.  In  November  2004,  ADB  organized  a  regional \nstudy  tour  for  IWG  members  to  learn  from  the  experience  of  relevant  institutional  models  in \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.6 Based on the observations made and good examples seen \nduring the study tour\u2014especially that of Federal Land Development Authority of Malaysia\u2014ADB \nproposed that the Government set up Lao Plantation Authority. The Government agreed to this \nproposal during the Loan Fact-Finding Mission in March 2005. \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2001.

Within these \nprovinces,  suitable  areas  for  plantations  will  be  identified  using  the  criteria  below.  Given  the \ninfrastructure and site conditions, multinational companies are keen to establish large industrial \nplantations  (LIPs)  in  Bolikhamxay,  Khammuane,  and  Savannakhet  provinces.  In  these  three \nprovinces, small livelihood plantations (SLPs) will be supported through a company-community \nmodel  in  coordination  with  LIPs.  Therefore,  the  Project  supported  core  SLP  clusters  will  be \nestablished  in:  (i)  Vientiane  Capital,  (ii)  Bolikhamxay  province,  and  (iii)  adjacent  districts  of \nSaravane  and  Champasack  provinces.  The  districts  where  these  clusters  will  be  located  are \nshown in Table A4. \n \n\nTable A4: Identified Districts for Three Clusters \n\n \n\nCluster \n\nCluster 1  \n\nCluster 2 \n\nCluster 3 \n \n\n     Province \n\nVientiane Capital \n\nBolikhamxay \n\nSaravane \nChampasack \n\n     District \n\nMaypakngum \nXathany \nPaksan \nBolikhan \nLao Ngum \nBachiangchaluensook \nSanasombon \n\nNote: Saravane and Champasack have a combined cluster. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2. \nUnder the Project, SLPs will be established on about 9,500 hectares (ha) which will be \ndivided more or less equally among three core clusters with 3,000\u20133,500 ha in each. In addition, \nthe core clusters already have areas of plantations established by the Industrial Tree Plantation \nProject (ITPP).1 It is estimated that there are at  least 700\u20131,000 ha of ITPP plantations within \neach of the core clusters. The Project will also support around 1,000 ha of medium enterprise \nplantations (MEPs). As much as possible, these will also be established within the core cluster \nareas,  giving  an  additional  area  of  around  300\u2013400  ha  in  each  cluster.  These  three  types  of \nplantations  would  create  a  combined  area  of  about  5,000  ha  per  core  cluster,  which  is \nconsidered  to  be  an  appropriate  size  to  capture  the  scale  economies  for  providing  extension, \nharvesting, and transport services and wood processing capacity. \n \nA. \n\nSite Selection Criteria \n\nFour  criteria  have  been/will  be  used  in  selecting  sites  for  core  clusters/degraded \n3. \nforestland  (DFL)  within  these  clusters  for  SLPs:  (i)  markets,  (ii)  site  conditions,  (iii)  labor \navailability, and (iv) incidence of poverty. These criteria are to some extent correlated and the \nconditions that trigger the rejection of sites under each of the criteria are subject to change to \nsome degree over time. Thus, sites that may be rejected now could be acceptable at a future \ndate. Two criteria are physical and two social, and each has economic consequences. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1993.

(Loan 1295\u2013LAO). \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\n1. \n\nMarkets \n\n4. \nFor any production system, the input and output markets is a key factor. Therefore, the \nrelationship  between  the  production  site  and  markets  for  the  produce  is  critical.  However,  the \nnature  of  this  relationship  changes  over  time  and  varies  with  the  product  type.  With  forest \nproduction systems, there are a wide range of products that vary over time. For timber products, \nthere  is  a  price-size  curve  that  is  generally  \u201cS\u201d  shaped.  Small  logs,  mainly  used  for  fuelwood, \nhave a low price, and medium logs for pulp or composite panel manufacture command a slightly \nhigher  price.  Large  logs,  for  sawmilling  and  manufacture  of  joinery,  furniture  and  construction \nmaterial, command a 30\u201335% higher price. Logs with diameter >50 centimeters (cm) command \nhigher prices for certain species and special end uses. \n \n5. \nThe markets for each of these product categories also vary. Fuelwood is normally sold \nlocally or consumed by the producers. But it may also be used for charcoal-making, which has a \nwide  range  of  potential  markets.  High  quality  charcoal  is  shipped  half  way  round  the  world. \nPulpwood  and  chipwood  are  specialized  markets  and  are  dependent  on  processing  capacity. \nSince  there  are  generally  few  plants  in  the  area,  their  location  is  known  at  the  outset,  so  a \nhaulage cost that enables the grower to achieve an acceptable price can be determined. At the \nsame time, there are enormous economies of scale that apply to both pulp and composite panel \nmanufacture, so processing plants tend to be large. The maximum distance for pulpwood for an \nexisting  pulp  mill  is  dependent  on  distribution  of  existing  plantations  and  available  modes  of \ntransport.  However,  the  large  volumes  required  by  a  mill  mean  that  an  assured  and  large \nvolume at a long distance may be preferable to a closer yet unreliable and scattered supply. \n \n6. \nWorld  demand  for  pulp  and  paper,  hence  wood  fiber,  is  growing  steadily  and  many \nmultinational companies are planning to expand their capacity. Since many of their existing mills \nhave  limitations  on  their  raw  material  supply,  these  companies  are  more  likely  to  build  new \ncapacity wherever they can find new resources, rather than expand their existing plants. Thus, \nlack of an existing market for pulpwood within an economic distance does not exclude a site if \nthere is sufficient potential for raw material within a reasonable radius of a site where a pulp mill \ncould  be  set  up  in  future.  The  same  logic  would  apply  to  a  medium  density  fiberboard  (MDF) \nplant with a substantially lower raw material requirement than a pulp mill. \n \nPart of the Project strategy is to promote a sufficiently large area of industrial plantations \n7. \nto  attract  1\u20132  pulp  mills  and  a  few MDF  plants  to  the  Lao People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao \nPDR) in the near future. It is possible to identify the most likely sites for such plants by applying \ncriteria\u2014accessibility,  availability  of  labor,  power,  and  water\u2014that  limit  the  choice  of  potential \nsites.  Establishing  plantations  on  speculation  that  a  plant  will  be  built  in  the  future  increases \nrisks  for  planters.  However,  Lao  Plantation  Authority  (LPA)  will  apply  robust  criteria  to  select \nappropriate  sites  for  clusters  and  determine  whether  aggregate  area  within  clusters  would  be \nsufficient to attract investments in processing plants by the private sector. Experience in other \ncountries, where extensive plantations have been established without processing plants, shows \nthat  they  follow  once  raw  material  supplies  reach  a  critical  mass.  The  advantage  of  forest \nplantations is that planters can leave the trees growing for a few more years until more attractive \nprices are offered. The trees, in the meantime, will continue to grow and add value. \n \n8. \nAn important factor related to location is the minimum plantation area required to ensure \nsustainable raw material supplies to a variety of processing plants. Markets are quickly emerging \naround  the  selected  core  clusters.  Good  all-weather  roads  permit  vehicles  to  provide  economical \ntransport. The prevailing average roadside price around these clusters, $13.5 per cubic meter (m3), \nis enough to make a plantation with mean annual increment (MAI) of 16 m3/ha (yield class [YC] 16) \nfinancially  viable.  In  5\u20137  years,  about  5,000  ha  of  productive  plantations  in  each  cluster  could \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\npotentially  supply  60,000  m3/year  of  wood;  enough  raw  material  to  feed  a  medium-sized  MDF \nmanufacturing plant (set up with an investment of $5 million). \n \n\n2. \n\nSite Conditions \n\nSite  selection  is  as  important  as  the  location.  It  means  that  DFL  with  suitable  soil \n9. \nproperties  and  appropriate  hydrology  and  topography  should  be  chosen  for  forest  plantations. \nThe  following  criteria  will  be  applied  in  selecting  DFL  for  forest  plantations:  (i)  crown  density \nmust be <20%; (ii) lands within a designated National Biodiversity Conservation Area should be \nexcluded; (iii) soil slope should be <20\u00b0 to avoid risk of soil damage and erosion; and (iv) a safe \ndistance,  about  100  m,  should  be  maintained  from  water  bodies  (streams,  lakes,  canals, \nwatercourses). Sites with slopes >20\u00b0 will be costlier to harvest in the future. From geographic \ninformation  system  (GIS)  data  and  field  surveys,  it  is  clear  that  DFL  on  flatter  land  is  not \nhomogenous and includes a range of conditions from more or less grassland, through varying \ndegrees of scrub and bush to secondary forest. Somewhere along the continuum, there would \nbe  a  point  at  which  the  secondary  forest  is  sufficiently  well  stocked  with  useful  species  that  it \nshould be left to regenerate naturally. LPA will survey such area and determine its classification, \ndepending on a number of factors\u2014size and diameter distribution of trees by species and their \nquality, and threats that may affect regeneration. \n \n10. \nHaving  eliminated  areas  of  DFL  within  National  Biodiversity  Conservation  Areas\u2014on \nsteeper  slopes,  away  from  water  bodies,  with  the  capacity  to  regenerate  naturally\u2014attention \nshould be paid to soil conditions. Acid, shallow and/or compacted, and unduly rocky soils should \nbe  avoided  as  these  soils  will  reduce  plant  growth  and  require  higher  inputs  of  fertilizers  and \nmanagement.  Only  those  soils  that  would  ensure  a  YC16  or  more  should  be  selected.  While \nselecting DFL for forest plantations, it would be important to consider alternative land uses. DFL \nthat meet the above criteria, but have a high opportunity cost because they are suitable for uses \nthat yield higher returns than forest plantations, should be excluded. This would exclude fertile \nand flatter lands near settlements where forestry activities are normally unable to compete. \n \n11. \nFinally,  the  amount  of  suitable  DFL  that  meets  these  criteria  within  a  village,  and/or \nwithin  a  group  of  neighboring  villages,  is  important.  In  order  to  minimize  market  risk  and \nmaximize prices, it is imperative to establish forest plantations on at least 3,000\u20135,000 ha within \na  radius  of  about  25  kilometers  (km)  from  an  existing  or  potential  site  of  a  processing  plant. \nSuch  a  cluster  of  forest  plantations  should  be  able  to  supply  50,000\u201370,000  m3  annually  in  a \nsustainable manner. The total land area within a 25 km radius is about 200 km2 (200,000 ha), \nimplying that forest plantations would only constitute <0.025% of the total area. \n \n12. \nTo provide a cost-effective extension service and capture economies of scale for future \nharvesting  and  marketing  of  plantation  logs,  LPA  will  select  villages  where  at  least  20 \nhouseholds want to participate in a block of about 100 ha (assuming average DFL allocation of \n5  ha  per  household).  This  area  will  eventually  produce  a  sustainable  annual  output  of  around \n2,000 m3 of timber, which is enough to fill 2\u20133 trucks every week. Some 3\u20134 such subclusters \nproducing  6,000-8,000  m3  annually  within  a  radius  of  5\u201310  km  would  keep  one  truck  fully \noccupied year-round hauling the produce 30\u201350 km to market. About 10 such subclusters within \nthe wider radius of around 25 km would meet the minimum marketing requirements. Hence, a \nlocal  transport  industry  would  also  evolve,  creating  more  jobs  and  trade  opportunities,  and \nproviding cost effective transport. An illustrative layout of SLP subclusters within the core cluster \nis provided in Figure A4.1. \n \n13. \nclusters and lead to further efficiencies, such as the following. \n\nThe  two  elements  of  site  selection  criteria  described  above  will  establish  SLPs  in \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\nPlanters would gain adequate competence as forest plantations become a major \ncrop in the area; in time, they will learn from each other and become less reliant \non LPA\u2019s extension service. \nFor LPA, larger-scale operations will be more efficient and cost-effective for land-\nuse planning, socio-technical planning, site selection, and extension.   \nService  delivery,  monitoring,  and  management  supervision  will  become  cost \neffective  as  households  will  be  grouped  in  subclusters  and  concentrated  in  a \nlimited area. \n\n(iv)  Well  trained  workforce  will  emerge  to  provide  specialized  harvesting  and \n\ntransport services.  \nMechanical land clearing, through subcontracting, will become cost-effective.  \nRoad construction and maintenance cost could be financed from plantation cess. \nForest  plantations  in  blocks  will  provide  economies  of  scale  in  fencing  and \nmaintaining firebreak belts. \n\n(viii)  A concentrated resource base in a cluster will make it feasible to set up a group \n\ncertification scheme (within the Forest Stewardship Council system).   \nCluster  forest  plantations  of  some  magnitude  may  qualify  for  and  become \nattractive to carbon credit agreements. \n\nFigure A4.1: Distribution Model of Subclusters for Small Livelihood Plantations \nto Minimize Transaction Costs \n\nRadius 5 km, \ngross area 8,000 ha \nplantation area 500 ha, \none-truck full-time \nannual production \n>8,000 m3\n\nVillage with \n100 ha \nplantations\n\nRadius 25 km, \ngross area 198,000 ha \nplantation area 5,000 ha, \n10 trucks fulltime, annual \nproduction >80,000 m3\n\nha = hectare, km = kilometer, m3 = cubic meters. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n3. \n\nLabor Availability \n\n14. \nEstablishing and maintaining a forest plantation requires that a sufficient amount of labor \nis  available,  preferably  from  household  members.  Planters  could  use  part  of  the  cash  equity \nfinanced by LPA to hire some casual labor, depending on the opportunity cost of family labor. \nPlanters that are currently able to produce surplus agricultural commodities may prefer to hire \ncasual labor, in which case family labor does not become a limiting factor. For poorer planters \nwith low agricultural productivity, cash income for labor is likely to be more important. For such \nhouseholds, the allocation of DFL will be constrained by the number of family members that can \nwork on plantations. Most plantation work is not particularly heavy, so it could be undertaken by \nwomen and teenage children. A typical calendar for farm labor requirement in the lower Mekong \nplains has been prepared to ascertain the availability of excess household labor and determine \na possible conflict in timing of farm and plantation operations (Supplementary Appendix A). The \ncalendar  shows,  a  household  of  two  adults  and  a  teenage  child  cultivating  one  ha  of  paddy \ncould easily establish and maintain a 5-ha plantation in 5 years (establishing 1 ha per year). As \na guide, the following recommendations are made for allocating DFL based on household labor \navailability: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nhouseholds with only one available worker: 0.5 ha; \nhouseholds with two available workers: 1.5 ha if planted in a single year or up to \n4 ha if planted over several years but not more than 0.8 ha per year; and \nhouseholds  with  more  than  two  available  workers:  2\u20133  ha  if  planted  in  a  single \nyear or up to 5 ha if planted over 3\u20135 years. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nIncidence of Poverty \n\n15. \nPoverty  reduction  is  one  of  the  primary  objectives  of  the  Project,  so  high  incidence  of \npoverty  is  one  of  the  main  criteria  for  selecting  participating  villages.  However,  poverty  has \nseveral  dimensions  and  causes;  among  them  is  remoteness,  which  implies  lack  of  access  to \nmarkets  and  social  services.  Some  communities  with  high  incidence  of  poverty  may  be \nexcluded  from  the  Project  due  to  unsuitable  soil  quality  and/or  lack  of  access  to  markets. \nExperience  with  ITPP  has  shown  that  failure  to  achieve  a  reasonable  level  of  plantation \nproductivity  may  actually  aggravate  poverty.  Therefore,  great  care  will  be  taken  while  dealing \nwith communities where there is a high incidence of poverty but other criteria are not fully met. \n \nB. \n\nInitial Selection Procedure \n\nDuring  project  preparation,  the  Lao  Plantation  Atlas,  employing  GIS  database,  was \n16. \nprepared  (can  be  accessed  from  the  Project  web  site).  It  provides  detailed  maps  of  relevant \nprovinces  showing  land-use  patterns,  geography,  road  network,  other  infrastructure,  existing \nforest  industry  and  plantations,  as  well  as  environmental  and  social  indicators.  Based  on  this \natlas and the above criteria, three core clusters have been identified in suitable localities. The \nselection procedure is shown in Figure A4.2. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nFigure A4.2: Target Area Selection Procedure \n\nLocation: \nProximity to Markets \n(wood processing industry\u2019s capacity \nand/or potential, population centers, \nexisting plantations) \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nLand Availability: \nAdequate Degraded Forestland \n(crown-cover <20%, no conflict with \nalternative or more productive uses, not \nsuitable for agricultural crops, excluded \nfrom protection and conservation areas) \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nSearch new \nlocation \n\nSearch for \nalternative \n\nLand Suitability: \nConducive Soil Conditions \n(soils not acidic, sodic, or rocky, \nslope <20\u00b0, away from water bodies, \nadequate rainfall) \n\nSearch for \nalternative \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nParticipatory Land-use Planning  \n(community and local authority\u2019s \napproval of land-use plan, incidence of \npoverty, availability of family labor, \nwillingness to participate in LPA\u2019s SLP \nprogram with equity-sharing model) \n\nLPA = Lao Plantation Authority, SLP = small livelihood plantation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nPlantation Development Strategy \n\nThe  DFL  selection  criteria,  described  above,  lead  to  a  clear  plantation  development \n17. \nstrategy.  Preliminary  screening  of  potential  sites  in  the  seven  Project  provinces  for  all  three \ntypes  of  plantations  (SLPs,  MEPs,  and  LIPs)  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  indicates \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nthat  it  is  appropriate  and  feasible.  The  strategy  has  a  two-track  approach.  LPA  will  adopt  the \ntrack 1 approach, to identify DFL for LIPs. Initial screening has indicated that extensive tracts of \nDFL,  suitable  for  LIPs,  are  mostly  located  in  Khammuane  and  Savannakhet,  and  to  lesser \nextent in Bolikhamxay provinces. After a relatively low intensity ground check, LPA will prepare \nprospectus for these areas. Potential foreign investors, mainly pulp and paper companies, will \nthen  be  invited  to  apply  for  a  prospecting  license  to  undertake  more  detailed  participatory \nsurveys in coordination with the local communities and authorities. The prospecting license will \ngive  investors  exclusive  rights  for  2  years  in  well-defined  areas,  to  survey,  identify,  negotiate, \nand delineate DFL to lease for establishing LIPs.2  \n \n18. \nTrack  2  will  identify  DFL  for  SLPs  (and  MEPs)  following  the  selection  criteria  and \nprocedure  as  described  above  (and  in  Figure  A4.2).  The  SLP  target  under  the  Project  is \n9,500 ha.  Preliminary  screening  has  indicated  that  this  area  could  easily  be  found  within \n6 districts  in  3  clusters  as  described  in  Table  A4.  If  the  detailed  selection  procedure  does  not \nidentify  the  full  target  area  in  these  districts,  then  the  process  will  be  extended  to  neighboring \ndistricts.  \n \nD. \n\nPlantation Management and Compliant Redress Mechanism \n\n19. \nLPA\u2019s  plantation  extension  officer  will  work  with  the  selected  groups  (and  other \ncommunity  members,  as  appropriate)  to  plan  how  the  Project  will  be  implemented  locally, \nincluding  building  capacity  for  sustainable  local  management.  Both  a  basic  self-monitoring \nprocess  and  a  communication  plan  will  be  developed.  Discussion  will  be  held  to  determine \nprocedures and key features that constitute success (i.e., indicators). Procedures would involve \nsemiannual meetings and/or setting up a subcommittee (with rules for selection and rotation of \nmembers  and  defined  roles  and  responsibilities)  to  assess  progress  and  report  to  project \nofficials  on  any  emerging  issues  that  require  outside  assistance.  Key  features  might  include: \n(i) technical  aspects,  such  as  adequate  plantation  growth  and  appropriate  management  of \ninputs;  and  (ii) social/institutional  elements,  such  as  proper  record  keeping,  receipt  of  contract \ndocuments, adequate planning for collective sales of produce, appropriate and timely technical \nand  financial  planning  for  purchase  of  inputs  for  regeneration  after  each  cycle  and  replanting \nafter  2\u20133  rotations,  as  needed.  In  addition,  the  group  as  a  whole  should  agree  on  a  plan  for \nmanaging any shortcomings they detect when reviewing their own progress. A communication \nplan  will  also  be  prepared.  Community  members  must  know  who  they,  or  their  chosen \nrepresentative, should contact for technical or capacity-building support (for example, financial \nor conflict management facilitation), and, if necessary, how to register complaints or grievances \nwith project management, and the maximum time they should wait for a response. The Project \nwill  ensure  that  staff  are  available  to  provide  training  in  long-term  technical,  managerial,  and \nfinancial  planning,  and  respond  to  community  requests  and  complaints.  A  complaint  redress \nmechanism, as part of the communication plan, will be set up in the Public Relations Office. \n\n                                                 \n2   This  arrangement  is  similar  to  BGA  Lao  Plantation,  Ltd\u2019s  concession  but  it  will  give  a  shorter  time  limit  to  new \n\ninvestors to take expeditious action to establish LIPs or yield to other interested investors.  \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nPOLITICAL RISK GUARANTEE FACILITY \n\n1. \nIn  addition  to  equity  and  debt  financing,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  also \nprovides various types of credit enhancement products. Among them is political risk guarantee \n(PRG)  which  is  provided  to  investors  (for  tier-two  capital,  i.e.,  shareholder  loans  and  loan \nguarantees) and financial institutions to cover risks that they cannot easily absorb or manage on \ntheir own. Mitigating these risks can make a crucial difference in mobilizing long-term financing, \nespecially for private sector projects. While ADB guarantees provide explicit protection against \nperceived  political  risks,  investors  and  lenders  also  take  comfort  with  the  implicit  protection \nafforded  by  ADB's  involvement  in  a  project  (e.g.,  investment  disputes  between  parties  can  be \nresolved quicker and more amicably). \n \nThrough this Project, the Government wishes to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in \n2. \nthe  forest  plantations  subsector.  Given  the  significant  opportunities  for  FDI  in  this  subsector, \nlarge  amounts  of  financing  will  be  required  from  investors  and  commercial  lenders  to  achieve \nthe  Government\u2019s  development  objectives.  Because  the  Government  does  not  have  a  long-\nstanding track record with FDI, investors and commercial lenders may require a PRG to protect \ntheir  loans  against  perceived  political  risks  associated  with  the  region,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), and the forest plantations subsector. \n \nUnder  this  Project,  a  PRG  facility  (the  Facility)  will  be  established  for  investors  and \n3. \ncommercial lenders, covering eligible loans in the forest plantations subsector against perceived \npolitical risks in Lao PDR. The size of the Facility will be $400 million, backed by $200 million \nfrom  ADB  ordinary  capital  resources,  and  $200  million  from  external  resources  provided  by \ncommercial and official political risk insurers through reinsurance.1 ADB\u2019s gross exposure in the \nFacility  will be  $400  million  and  net  exposure  will  be  $200  million.  ADB\u2019s  net  exposure  will be \ncounter-guaranteed by the Government. The Guaranteed Percentage will be up to 100%. The \nterm of each PRG will be up to 30 years. \n \n4. \nThe purpose of the Facility is to enable ADB to respond more flexibly to requests from \ninvestors  and  financial  institutions  for  its  guarantee  instruments,  without  compromising  its \nenvironmental  policies  and  procedures,  and  social  safeguards.  Under  the  Facility,  ADB  will \nprovide PRG to investors and commercial lenders (Guarantee Holders) covering eligible loans. \nPRG will guarantee payment of debt as a result of the following risks: currency inconvertibility \nand  or  non-transfer,  expropriation,  breach  of  contract,  and  political  violence  (including \nterrorism). The Facility will not cover commercial risks. \n \n5. \nThe  annual  fee  for  each  PRG  will  be  paid  by  the  Guarantee  Holder.  The  fee  will  be \nmarket-based. The Guarantee Holder will also pay a one-time front-end fee of up to 1%. ADB \nwill  require  reinsurers  to  have  a  minimum  investment  rating  to  be  acceptable  for  reinsurance. \nADB  will  also  charge  a  ceding  commission  to  the  reinsurers  to  cover  costs  associated  with \nadministering  the  reinsurance.  The  ceding  commission  will  be  market-based.

Rural  poor \nhouseholds rely on forests for almost half of household incomes, and food security. However in recent times Lao PDR \nhas undergone a reduction in forest cover. There are large areas in the seven project provinces that are categorized \nas  degraded  forests.  Such  degradation  of  forests  can  affect  livelihoods  adversely.  Therefore,  the  Government  has \ndetermined  to  reduce  poverty  and  tap  the  poverty  reduction  potential  of  forest  plantation  development.  It  attaches \ngreat importance to forest protection and reforestation. \n \n \nB. \n                                                                                                        Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nParticipatory  poverty  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in  addition  to  a  survey  in  sample  communities  in  the  seven \nprovinces. Approximately 50% of rural households live below the poverty line. Female-headed households and ethnic \nminorities  are  vulnerable  to  poverty  and  food  insecurity.  Security  of  land  rights,  and  access  to  extension  services, \nmarkets, and capital for investment are among the requirements identified by the poor as essential for them to move \nout of poverty.  \n \n \nC. \n \n \nThe participation strategy in the Project is envisaged as fundamental to its implementation. All land-use planning and \nallocation will be done using participatory approaches. Households willing and able to join the Project will be provided \nwith all necessary information. All extension and training will be made available at village level by the Lao Plantation \nAuthority (LPA). For ethnic minority beneficiaries, culturally appropriate interventions will be used. \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \n \nD. \n \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThere is a clear strategy to reach women equally in the Project. All agreements and land-use certificates will be in the \njoint  names  of  husband  and  wife,  or  singly  for  female-headed  households.  During  participatory  land-use  planning, \nwomen\u2019s  group  meetings  will  be  specifically  held  to  ensure  their  informed  participation  in  decisions.  Women  will  be \nprovided equal opportunities to access extension and training services. \n \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n\nGender Development \n\n   Yes               \n\n    Yes \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n   No \n\n\fSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \n\n \nE. \n \n\nItem \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\n None \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nthat  may  affect  peoples\u2019 \n\nto  address  negative \nresettlement  and \n\nTo address any likelihood of land-use change under the \nProject \nlivelihoods,  an \ninvoluntary resettlement framework has been prepared. \n \nIn  the  small  livelihood  plantation  program,  participation \nwill  be  voluntary.

ADF has \nallocated  half  of  the  program  amount  for  Lao  PDR  as  grant.1  ADF  allocation  for  the  Project  is \nidentified in the Country Strategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008. \n \n2. \nRationale. The grant under this Project will be used to establish and then operate LPA \nfor the 6-year Project period. Since LPA is being set up as a new semiautonomous institution\u2014\nan  unprecedented  development  in  Lao  PDR\u2014the  Government  is  reluctant  to  borrow  for  this \nventure. The grant is justified because LPA will set new standards of excellence by employing \nrelatively inexperienced but well-educated and bright local staff at competitive salary packages \nalong  with  performance  bonuses.  The  position  of  chief  technical  advisor  (CTA)  will  also  be \nfunded  with  this  grant.  This  institutional  arrangement  will  ensure  that  requisite  capacity  is \ncreated  to  develop  the  subsector  in  line  with  its  potential.  The  Government  will  ensure  its \nfinancial  sustainability  beyond  the  Project  life  by  providing  it  a  legal  remit,  through  prime \nministerial  decree,  to:  (i) recover  and  retain  its  share  of  the  revenues  from  investments  in \nplantations;  (ii)  charge  for  its  services  and  retain  its  income;  and  (iii)  receive  part  of  the  land \nrents,  as  land  management  fee,  from  large  industrial  plantations  (LIPs)  to  defray  its  service \ncosts.  This  grant  will  also  catalyze  further  parallel  grant  cofinancing  from  the  Government  of \nMalaysia,  which  will  second  three  experts  to  head  three  LPA  divisions.  Therefore,  the  Project \ngrant is a special feature, without which, LPA might not have been established. LPA will play a \ncritical role in implementing the Project and developing the plantations subsector efficiently and \nexpeditiously. The full-scale model of LPA is described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n3. \nProposed  Grant  Activities.  Establishment  of  productive  forest  plantations  requires \neffective land-use planning, extension and training, appropriate modes of financing, and efficient \nmarketing. Existing institutions in Lao PDR have weak capacity to provide effective support to \nforest plantations that require a specific set of expertise. Such skills cannot be gained without \nengaging experts with a proven track record from elsewhere and providing hands-on training to \nappropriately  compensated  and  motivated  local  staff.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  set  up  an \ninstitution like LPA that could create the requisite institutional and staff capacity by engaging the \nrelevant  experts  from  overseas  in  the  medium  term.  Given  the  significant  potential  of  this \nsubsector  in  Lao  PDR  and  the  ominous  signs  of  its  rapid  development,  LPA  will  help  the \nGovernment  take  advantage  of  these  opportunities.  LPA  will  provide  an  effective  full-package \nservice  to  small  livelihood  and  medium  enterprise  plantations,  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises; and one-window service to LIPs. A semiautonomous and appropriately staffed LPA \nwill bridge the capacity gap in a short period and later create capacity among local staff through \na  staff  transition  plan.  By  the  end  of  the  6-year  Project  period,  LPA  will  be  a  premier \nGovernment agency mainly staffed by local experts, with the possible exception of the CTA. \n \n4. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  Grant  effectiveness  will  be  assessed  within  the  broader \ncontext  of  project  performance.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  3) \nhas  clear  indicators  to  measure  the  inputs,  activities,  and  outputs  financed  through  the  grant. \nThe outcomes and impacts are closely aligned to the Government\u2019s strategies. \n\n                                                 \n1 As per the Staff Instructions, memo of DG, SPD dated 16 November 2004 approved by the President, up to 50% of \n\nthe total program assistance to Lao PDR can be provided as grant. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nSTRUCTURE, STAFF, AND FUNCTIONS OF THE LAO PLANTATION AUTHORITY  \n\n1. \nThe  management  structure  of  the  Lao  Plantation  Authority  (LPA)  is  shown  in  the \norganizational  chart  in  Figure  A9.

The  immediate  purpose  is  to  set  up  an  effective \ninstitution that supports livelihood plantations and acts as a catalyst to attract large-scale foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) for industrial plantations and subsequent development of a modern and \nefficient  wood  processing  industry,  generating  considerable  employment  and  government \nrevenues. The bulk of the project funds will be invested in supporting livelihood plantations that \nwould significantly contribute to poverty reduction among participating households.  \n \nThe  Project  will  establish  Lao  Plantation  Authority  (LPA),  whose  business  plan  will \n2. \ncomprise  three  main  activities:  (i)  support  small  livelihood  plantations  (SLPs),  (ii)  facilitate \noperations  of  large  industrial  plantations  (LIPs),  and  (iii)  promote  plantation  enterprise \ndevelopment by supporting medium enterprise plantations (MEPs) and small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs).  LPA,  as  a  semiautonomous  and  financially  sustainable  body,  will  be  the \nexecuting agency of the Project. It will provide full-package service to SLPs, MEPs, and SMEs. \nLPA  will  finance  SLPs  and  MEPs  through  an  equity-sharing  model  and  support  business \ndevelopment of SMEs through technical assistance. All financing arrangements will be in hard \ncurrency  on  market-based  terms,  and  financially  viable.  No  indirect  or  direct  subsidies  will  be \nneeded and none provided.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  generate  a  variety  of  direct,  indirect,  quantifiable,  and  nonquantifiable \nbenefits.  The  direct  and  quantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  to  SLPs,  MEPs,  and  SMEs.  LIPs  will \nget  direct  but  unquantifiable  benefits  as  LPA  will  facilitate  land-use  survey  and  planning,  and \nnegotiate land lease agreements with them on behalf of the Government. LPA\u2019s facilitating role \nwill significantly reduce the transaction cost of FDI in this subsector. Plantations of all types will \ngenerate  significant  direct  employment  in  down-  and  upstream  trade  and  supply  chains.  LIPs \nwill  generate  large  sums  of  revenues  in  land  rents  as  well  as  in  corporate  income  and  local \ntaxes. Similarly, MEPs and SMEs will generate employment and revenues. The most important \nsocial  impact  will  be  on  poverty  reduction\u2014a  direct  outcome  of  SLP  operations.  Increased \ngovernment revenues will have significant impact on poverty reduction at the national level, as a \nresult of increased investments in social development. \n \nC. \n \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Plantation Models \n\nMost  direct  and  quantified  benefits  of  the  Project  will  stem  from  three  main  sources: \n4. \n(i) return from SLPs; (ii) land rents from LIPs; and (iii) to lesser extent, returns from MEPs and \nSMEs.  Financial  analyses  focus  on  three  plantation  models,  i.e.,  SLP,  MEP,  and  LIP.  SLPs \nwould be established and managed by poor households. Land (3\u20135 ha per household) will be \ninitially allocated by issuing temporary land-use certificates (TLUCs). The size of land allocation \nto each household will depend on the family\u2019s labor availability. The participating household will \nestablish a plantation on about one ha per year. MEPs will be established by individuals or small \ncompanies  on  their  own,  leased,  or  purchased  lands.  MEPs  plantation  size  would  be  50\u2013100 \nha. LIPs would be established on >5,000 ha lands leased from the Government. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\n5. \nTo  examine  the  financial  viability,  1-ha  models  for  each  of  these  three  types  of \nplantations  have  been  developed.1  These  models  are  for  growing  Eucalyptus  established  and \nmanaged  according  to  current  best  practices.  Based  on  field  survey  of  the  Industrial  Tree \nPlantation Project (ITPP)2 plantations, yield tables for Eucalyptus were generated. Since limited \ndata are available for Acacia mangium in Lao PDR, Eucalyptus yield tables can be used for both \nspecies, with the necessary adjustments. Current market prices for inputs (seedlings, fertilizers, \ninsecticides,  fencing  material,  machine  rentals,  etc.)  were  used  in  these  models.  Daily  labor \nwage  varies  significantly  in  Vientiane  Capital  and  other  provinces.  Average  wage  rate  of  $1.5 \n(KN15,000)  per  day  was  used  in  the  analysis.  Many  potential  products  from  plantation  wood \n(fuelwood from thinning and charcoal manufactured from roots and stumps collected during land \nclearing) have good financial value but were not included in the analysis. \n \n6. \nFinancial  analysis  was  carried  out  using  constant  2005  prices.  Input  and  output  prices \nwere  converted  to  US  dollars  at  the  current  exchange  rate.  The  base  case  uses  yield  class \n(YC)3 16 for  SLPs, YC20 for  MEPs,  and YC24 for LIPs. The weighted  average cost of capital \nwas estimated to be about 1%. To estimate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), a 24-year \ntime horizon was used, including original rotation and two coppice rotations. Sensitivity analysis \nwas  undertaken  by  varying  the  key  factors,  i.e.,  YC,  labor  substitution  with  machinery,  log \nprices, and land rents. \n \n7. \nThe  results  show  that  plantations  are  financially  viable  (Table  A11.1).  Sensitivity \nanalyses  show  that  FIRR  is  sensitive  to  labor  substitution  with  machinery.  This  is  evident  by \nFIRRs for YC20 for all three types of plantations; use/cost of machinery increases from MEP to \nLIP. YC is the most important determinant of financial viability. Therefore, site selection is critical \nfor  the  success  of  plantations  in  almost  all  circumstances.  SLPs  and  MEPs  should  only  be \nestablished on sites where, at least, YC16 could be attained. Similarly, LIPs should preferably \nplan for, at least, YC20. Proximity to markets is critical for the success of plantations\u2014about half \nof the price at mill-gate 250 km from plantation would, on average, be the transportation cost. \nThe  Project  design  has  taken  this  factor  into  account  and  introduced  the  concept  of  clusters \n(Appendix  4)  to  ensure  adequate  density  of  plantations  within  reasonable  distance,  i.e.,  25\u2013\n75 km  to  market.  For  sites  of  YC20  or  better,  rotation  for  20%\u201325%  of  the  stock  may  be \nextended to 10 years (or more) to take advantage of the (30%\u201335%) higher prices of sawlogs. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return of Eucalyptus Plantations in Lao PDR \n\nLand Rent \n($/ha/year) \n\nYield Class 16 \n$20 \n$10 \n\nYield Class 20 \n$30 \n\n$40 \n\n$20 \n\nYield Class 24 \n$40 \n\n$30 \n\n$50 \n\nPlanter \n\nLivelihood \nEnterprise \nIndustrial \n\nArea \n(ha)a \n  25 \n 100 \n>200 \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n\n13 \n12 \n \n\n12 \n10 \n \n\n16 \n14 \n13 \n\n15 \n13 \n12 \n\n14 \n12 \n11 \n\n \n16 \n15 \n\n \n15 \n14 \n\n \n14 \n13 \n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, ha = hectare. \na Area in blocks to minimize fencing costs; log price assumed $13.5/m3 at roadside. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\na. \n\nEquity-Sharing Model for Small Livelihood Plantations \n\n8. \nUnder  ITPP,  livelihood  planters  were  provided  with  credit  to  establish  plantations,  on \naverage, about $600\u2013$1,000 per ha. The credit was subsidized at 7% per annum in kip, which \n\n                                                 \n1   More detailed description, data, and tables are provided in the Supplementary Appendix A. \n2   ADB.  1993.

Therefore,  given  the  high  rates  of  inflation  and  currency \nexchange,  even  the  full  worth  of  the  principal  in  real  terms  will  not  be  recovered  from  the \nmajority of ITPP borrowers. The interest payments fell due within a year of borrowing. This was \na  rather  unfavorable  arrangement  on  many  counts\u2014not  least,  because  poor  planters  had  no \ncash income in the early years of planting and yet were required to make interest payments for \nthe credit. In fact, there was no need for subsidized credit, especially in kip, if the operation was \ndesigned to be productive and financially viable. The ITPP subsidized credit scheme attracted \nmany  who  were  not  serious  about  establishing  productive  plantations  and/or  did  not  plant  the \nfull area declared in their credit applications. \n \n9. \nGiven the long (8-year)  plantation production cycle, such investments bear an inherent \nrisk.  Throughout  the  production  cycle,  but  especially  in  the  first  3  years,  plantations  require \nsound  and  continued  technical  support.  At  the  end  of  the  8-year  cycle,  they  need  efficient \nmarketing services to fetch fair prices. Therefore, under the Project, LPA will adopt a profit and \nloss-sharing equity model to finance SLPs. A 1-ha SLP model is in Table A11.2. For 1-ha SLPs, \nthe  total  (input)  variable  cost  amounts  to  about  $713/ha.  The  bulk  (70%)  of  input  costs  is \nrequired  during  year-1.  Input  costs  decrease  progressively  by  year-2  (15%)  and  year-3  (9%). \nHarvesting cost, in year-8, is about 7% of the total production cost. Although the model shows \nthat the planter would provide all the labor, LPA will compensate the planter for the full cost of \nlabor  in  year-1,  and  up  to  50%  for  that  of  year-2  and  year-3.  The  total  payout  for  labor  costs \nduring the first 3 years, from LPA to planter, would be $313. Other than direct input costs, LPA\u2019s \nequity will also include $30/ha/year for the first 3 years as the extension service cost, and $10 \nfor harvesting and marketing supervision in year-8. The land rent, estimated to be $20/ha/year \nfor  YC16,  is  included  as  planter\u2019s  equity.4  YC16  is  a  modest  yield  estimate  for  high-yielding \nplanting  stock  under  efficient  management,  which  LPA  is  expected  to  provide.  Perimeter \nprotection cost per ha, using poles and barbed wire, depends on the size of the plantation block. \nFor an isolated 1-ha plot, it would cost $218/ha but if SLPs are established in blocks of at least \n25  ha,  the  cost  would  drop  to  less  than  $44/ha.  This  model  assumes  the  latter  cost  because \nblock  plantations  would  provide  further  cost  reductions  and  efficiencies  in  other  operations  as \nwell.5 LPA will adopt this model for SLPs. \n \n10. \nBy  year-8,  the  total  equity  in  the  1-ha  plantation  would  be  $883.  Of  this  total,  LPA\u2019s \nshare of equity would be $621 (70%) and the planter\u2019s equity would be $262 (30%). With YC16 \nand  road-side  log  prices  at  $13.5/m3,  the  total  revenue  would  amount  to  $1,728,  providing  an \nFIRR  of  12%.  However,  it  is  proposed  that  LPA\u2019s  share  of  revenue  may  be  $862  (50%)  and \nplanter\u2019s  $865  (50%).6  In  case  YC16  is  attained  and  assumed  log  price  holds,  LPA\u2019s  share  in \nthe revenue is based on the following principle: full recovery of all its investments ($621) plus an \nFIRR  of  5.5%  on  its  investment  (2.5%  to  cover  hard  currency  inflation  +1.5%  to  cover  risk \npremium +1.5% bonus for LPA employees).7 The balance revenue ($865) would be passed on \nto livelihood planters, providing an FIRR of 33% on their share of the equity. In case YC16 is not \nattained due a variety of reasons (soil type, insect or disease attack, fire, etc.), LPA will share \nthe  loss  with  planters.  Detailed  conditions  of  the  LPA\u2013planter  contract  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4   For more details on the methodology of estimating land rents for plantations, see Supplementary Appendix A. \n5   More details of site selection and block plantation criteria are provided in Appendix 4. \n6   This  principle  of  revenue-sharing  is  based  on  assumptions  that  YC16  and  log  price  of  $13.5/m3  are  attained. \n\nConditions that would apply in case of loss or higher revenues are described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n7   LPA  will  conduct  its  business  in  Thai  baht  or  $  to  hedge  against  foreign  exchange  risk  and  inflation.

The latter will be necessary where soils \nhave hard pans. The impending industrial plantation development is likely to introduce improved and cost effective \nmechanized land clearing/preparation technology that should be adopted by LPA for livelihood plantations. \n\nb   Delivered on site. It includes a margin of 10% for replacing initially planted seedlings that may be lost. \nc   When soil preparation is mechanized, hole digging is not required. \nd   Mechanized soil preparation may reduce year-1 weeding inputs by 30% compared with manual soil preparation. \ne   The protection costs are sensitive to block size; costs in this model are estimated for a block of 25 ha. \nf   LPA will partly compensate planter for labor inputs. Equal amount is deducted from planter's share of equity. \ng   LPA will recover its equity plus 5.5% IRR (2.5% for inflation + 1.5% for risk premium + 1.5% for bonus to its staff). \n \n11. \nAfter the revenue is split, at the end of the first rotation (by year-8 for ha-1), the formal \ncontractual agreement between the planter and LPA, for that particular ha, will end. The same \nwould happen for ha-2 the following year and so on until trees in ha-5 are felled and revenues \nsplit. All revenues from the subsequent two rotations\u2014second rotation (years 16\u201320) and third \nrotation  (years  24\u201328)\u2014will  fully  belong  to  the  planter.  The  Government  issues  TLUCs  on  a \n3-year rolling basis. After the initial 3 years, according to the policy, if a holder is determined to \nhave  put  the  land  under  intended  and  productive  use,  TLUCs  can  be  turned  into  LUCs.  This \noften does not occur because Government institutions do not have the capacity to survey and \ncertify  the  use  of  land.  LPA  will  establish  and  maintain  a  land  registry  and  facilitate  the \nimplementation  of  this  policy  to  turn  TLUCs  into  LUCs  at  the  end  of  the  first  rotation,  for \nparticipants  who  will  have  established  their  credentials  as  serious  planters.  Moreover,  by  that \ntime, planters will have gained adequate skills and knowledge to carry on plantation operations \non their own. LPA will establish a revolving fund with its share of revenues and go on to expand \nthe area of SLPs for another set of poor households elsewhere in the cluster. \n \nUnder  this  component,  around  2,000  poor  households  will  establish  financially  viable \n12. \nSLPs on about 9,500 ha in three clusters of about 3,000\u20133,500 ha each. LPA will provide them \nfull-package  service  through  an  equity-sharing  model.  Each  household,  on  average,  will  be \nallocated  3\u20135  ha  in  blocks  of  25\u201350  ha  in  the  vicinity  of  their  village.  SLPs  are  projected  to \nproduce  about  1  million  m3  of  pulpwood,  35,000  m3  of  sawlogs  and  100,000  m3  of  fuelwood \nduring  the  first  8-year  rotation.  Over  the  8-year  production  cycle,  it  is  estimated  that  about \n205 person-days/ha  of  labor  input  will  be  required  (about  173  person-days  during  the  first \n3 years  and  32  person-days  at  harvesting).  At  this  rate,  SLPs  will  generate  about  2  million \nperson-days of employment worth over $3 million during the first rotation. Therefore, the Project \nwill provide full and secure employment to the participating poor households. \n \n\nb. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\n13. \nDuring  preparation  of  the  Project,  household  income  surveys  were  carried  out  in  15 \nvillages  of  Vientiane  Capital,  and  Bolikhamxay,  Saravane,  and  Champasack  provinces.  The \nresults  showed  that  about  60%  of  the  households  were  classified  as  poor.  The  current  food \npoverty  line,  estimated  by  the  Government,  is  $123/capita/year  or  $738/household/year  for  a \nfamily of six. More than half the households sampled suffer shortages of rice and only 10% had \na small surplus for sale. The main source of livelihood is subsistence agriculture from growing \nrice and vegetables, raising livestock, seeking some off-farm employment, and collecting a few \nnon-timber forest products. The survey did not collect individual farmer\u2019s income or budget data, \nbut,  from  the  aggregate  data,  it  can  be  deduced  that  the  average  annual  household  cash \nincome  is  about  $150  (Table  A11.3).  The  cash  payouts  from  LPA  to  the  livelihood  planter  to \ncompensate for the labor inputs and revenue stream from the harvests of the first and second \nrotations  are  shown  in  Table  A11.4.  Currently,  under-  and  unemployment  in  rural  areas  is  as \nhigh as 50% or more. By participating in the SLP program with LPA, with 5 ha per household, \nthe  average  cash  income  from  wages  will  amount  to  $259/year  in  year-1  and  rise  to  over \n$300/year by year-5. By years 6 and 7, thinning of the earlier stands will start providing income \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nto  planters.  By  year-8,  the  stand  from  the  first  1-ha  will  be  felled  and  it  will  generate  $865 \nincome for the planter, and so on for the next 5 years. The second Eucalyptus rotation will be \ncoppiced.  Therefore,  the  cost  of  establishing  the  second  rotation  will  be  only  30%  of  the  first. \nThe  planter  will  keep  all  revenues  from  the  second  rotation.  In  the  intervening  periods \n(years 13\u201315 and 21\u201323), about 20\u201325% of good trees from the first and second rotations will \nbe  left  standing  to  turn  them  into  sawlogs,  which  fetch  30\u201335%  higher  prices.  In  all,  poor \nhouseholds  that  have  a  current  annual  income  of  $566  without  the  Project  (footnote  in \nTable A11.3)  will  increase  their  income  to  $858  with  the  Project,  pulling  them  above  the  food \npoverty  line  ($738)  in  year-1.  Within  8  years,  the  average  household will  have  enough  annual \ndisposable income ($942) over and above the paddy value of $416 to pay for adequate social \nservices such as education and primary healthcare. The multiplier effect on the economic well-\nbeing of individual households and the local economy will be significant, pulling them both out of \npoverty  and  turning  them  into  middle-income  groups.  This  equity-sharing  model  demonstrates \nthe  financial  viability  of  livelihood  plantations  and  their  potential  role  and  impact  on  poverty \nreduction in Lao PDR. \n \n\nTable A11.3: Average Annual Household Cash Incomes, Without and With Project \n\nSource of Income per Year \n\n% Households \n\n \n\nWithout Project \n\nApproximate \nCash Value ($) \n \n20 \n65 \n15 \n50 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nRice (own consumption)a \nRice sales \nLivestock \nNTFP \nOff-Farm Employment \nPlantation Employment \nDuring First 8 Years   \nSmall Livelihood Plantations \nAfter First 8-Year Rotation \n NTFP = non-timber forest product. \n  a  Average  landholding  in  the  Project  area  is  1  ha  per  household  of  six  people.

For \ninstance,  the  four  classical  factors  of  production\u2014land,  labor,  capital,  and  entrepreneurship\u2014\naptly  apply  to  the  plantation  operations.  Of  these,  the  return  to  (or  cost  of)  labor,  capital,  and \nentrepreneurship  are  fairly  well  known  based  on  the  current  operations  of  private  sector \ncompanies. In this model, the variable costs of production (including labor costs at $1.5/day and \nmanagement) have already been paid.8 Based on the 1-ha LIP model, a combination of FIRRs \nfor  YC16,  20,  and  24  m3/ha/year  assuming  log  prices  of  $12/m3  and  $13.5/m3  and  land  rents \nranging from $0\u2013$50/ha/year have been estimated (Table A11.5). For LIP operations, YC20 is \nconsidered  a  bare  minimum  and  it  is  also  fair  to  assume  a  log  price  of  $13.5/m3  for  such \noperations.  As  the  results  show,  after  paying  land  rent  of  $30/ha/year,  LIPs  would  be  able  to \ngenerate  an  FIRR  of  12%.  If  the  cost  of  capital  is  assumed  to  be  around  7%,  it  leaves  the \ncompany  with  a  5%  return  for  its  entrepreneurship.  It  is  likely  that  LIPs,  within  a  few  years  of \noperations, will be able to calibrate their production models and attain much higher yield classes \nas well as FIRRs. With YC24, FIRR for the same level of rent ($30/ha/year) would be 15% and \n                                                 \n8 The management cost for a large plantation operation (>5,000 ha) is estimated to be $30/ha/year. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n14% for rent of even $50/ha/year.

LPA \nwill  charge  about  $30/ha/year  for  its  services  to  SLPs  and  provide  all  the  material  at  cost. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nDevelopment  of  LIPs,  facilitated  by  LPA,  will  generate  significant  revenues  in  land  rents,  and \ncorporate and other taxes. It is estimated that land rents could be $20\u201350/ha/year depending on \nthe  soil  conditions  and  locations  of  LIPs.  Based  on  the  current  level  of  interest  by  the  private \nsector, it is envisaged that development of LIPs in the next 5\u201310 years will be rapid. However, \neven based on a modest estimate, by 2015 over 150,000 ha may be under LIPs. Assuming an \naverage  land  rent  of  $20/ha/year,  LIPs  would  be  generating  about  $3  million/year  by  2015  in \nland rents alone. At full development by 2020, the LIP area will be >325,000 ha and they will be \nharvesting  about  25,000  ha/year,  generating  an  estimated  land  rent  of  $6.5  million  and  tax \nrevenue of another $5 million a year (at 20% current corporate income tax). \n \n16. \nPart of LPA income will be a portion of the land prospecting license fees and land rents \ncollected  from  LIPs.  LPA\u2019s  land-use  planning  would  add  value  to  the  land,  which  would \notherwise be left unproductive. Therefore, it is justified that part of the rental revenues\u2014as land \nmanagement  fee\u2014should  be  used  to  finance  continuing  work  on  land-use  planning,  attracting \nand facilitating the entry of private companies in this subsector, and assisting the Government in \nregulating  their  operations  for  sustainable  plantation  management.  Additional  income  would \naccrue  to  LPA  from  a  service  charge  on  procurement  of  materials  (fertilizers,  insecticides, \nfencing materials, etc.) where it could take advantage of bulk purchase arrangements to obtain \ndiscounts.  Most  of  the  benefits  of  the  discount  could  be  passed  on  to  planters,  but  a  small \nproportion (about 2%) could be retained by LPA. Similarly, with the harvesting and marketing of \nplantation logs, LPA could negotiate a better price than that offered to individual planters by the \nmiddlemen and traders, and therefore retain a small margin (about 2%) as a service charge. \n \n17. \nTable  A11.6  gives  a  cash  flow  forecast  for  what  is  considered  to  be  an  attainable \nscenario. The first year is start up with no revenue but it entails less than full costs. It will take \nabout 2 years to recruit all the staff and set up offices. For the 6-year Project period, LPA will be \nfully financed by project funds. It will require stop-gap cash flow for years 7 and 8, which can be \nmet  by  receipts  from  land  management  fee.  From  year-9,  it  will  start  generating  its  own \nrevenues when the first SLP lot is felled. The analysis shows that, under the assumptions made, \nLPA will be financially self-sufficient with adequate working capital to continue expanding SLP \narea from year-10 and beyond. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n18. \nThe bulk (85%) of the Project investment will be made in SLPs and only modest (3%) in \nMEPs and SMEs; no direct investments will be made in LIPs. There will be quantifiable benefits \nfrom MEPs and SMEs but they are not included in the economic analysis. Similarly, the return to \nsociety  from  LIP  operations\u2014resulting  from  employment  and  revenue  generation\u2014will  be \nsignificant but they are also excluded from this analysis. The economic analysis, therefore, was \ncarried out including all LPA costs but the benefits only from SLPs. \n \n\na. \n\nEvaluation Methodology and Assumptions \n\n19. \nThe economic analysis has been carried out for a project life of 30 years. Constant 2005 \nprices were used in US dollars at the current exchange rate. Economic costs and benefits are \nestimated using the world price numeraire. The prices of non-traded goods have been adjusted \nby  using  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9.  This  is  equivalent  to  using  a  shadow  exchange \nrate  factor  of  1.1,  which  has  been  used  in  the  preparation  of  other  recent  Asian  Development \nBank projects in Lao PDR, and is appropriate as it approximately reflects the average level of \nduties  and  taxes.  A  shadow  wage  rate  of  0.8  has  been  used  to  reflect  the  under-  and \nunemployment  rate  in  rural  areas.  For  tractors  and  machinery,  used  in  mechanized  land \npreparation and other operations, taxes and duties account for about 35% of the domestic price. \nFor  these  activities,  a  conversion  factor  of  0.65  has  been  used.  The  prices  of  seedlings  and \nother domestically produced materials have not been adjusted. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nTable A11.6: Income, Expenditures, Revenues, and Cash Flow Projections for Lao

Project will be plantation logs. The log prices are set by the \ninternational  market  (mostly  Thai  for  now)  and  there  are  no  taxes  or  duties  on  the  export  of \nplantation  logs.  Therefore,  the  economic  prices  are  the  same  as  the  financial  prices.  The \nboarder  price  was  adjusted  for  transportation  cost  with  reference  to  Khon  Kaen  in  northeast \nThailand.1 Transportation costs for logs are adjusted by the standard conversion factor to reflect \ndifferences between international and domestic fuel prices. \n \n\nb. \n\nEconomic Viability \n\n21. \nThe estimated project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15% (Table A11.7). This \nis based on the benefits from three rotations of SLPs established on 9,500 ha. The first rotation \nwill be established with full cost but the second rotation starting in year-9 will be coppiced. The \nthird  rotation,  starting  in  year-17,  will  be  replanted  but  its  establishment  cost  will  be  less  than \nthat of the first rotation due to savings in fencing costs. The EIRR is fairly robust. The effects of \nchanges in key factors have been tested in sensitivity analysis. The impact of 20% increase in \nwage  rate  or  20%  decrease  in  log  price  drops  the  EIRR  to  14%  and  13%,  respectively.  The \nlimited impact of changes in these variables on EIRR shows that the project outcome would be \nrobust in response to moderate changes in these factors. However, the most significant impact \non  EIRR  is  by  the  YC;  if  it  drops  below  YC12,  SLPs  would  not  be  economically  viable. \nTherefore, LPA would ensure that SLPs are established on suitable lands, adequate training is \nimparted, and appropriate materials are provided to planters to attain YC16 or better. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Phoenix Pulp and Paper Company, Ltd, in Khon Kaen, is located 180 km from the Friendship Bridge boarder point \n\nnear Vientiane.

The results are summarized in Table A11.8. The \nproject  outcome  will  be  most  beneficial  to  the  poor  under  the  SLP  program;  by  sharing  about \n27%  of  the  cost,  they  will  receive  54%  of  the  benefits.  Similarly,  entrepreneurs  and  the \nGovernment  will  also  draw  a  higher  share  of  benefits  compared  with  their  share  in  the  cost. \nLPA, on the other hand, will share 59% of the cost but draw only 27% of the benefits. Almost all \nof  its  benefits  will  be  transferred  to  poor  households  under  the  SLP  program.  Despite  such  a \nsignificant  resource  transfer,  LPA  will  still  be  a  financially  viable  organization  in  the  long  run. \nThrough  its  share  of  revenues,  it  will  fully  recover  its  equity,  cost  of  management  and \noperations, bonus for its employees, and a surcharge for inflation. \n \n\nd. \n\nNon-Quantified Economic Benefits \n\n23. \nLPA will strengthen the institutional and staff capacity of the Government to develop the \nplantations  subsector.  Although  capacity  building  will  generate  significant  benefits  in  the  short \nand long term, direct benefits of these activities cannot be quantified. Similarly, the benefits of \nintegrated  land-use  planning,  allocation,  and  negotiating  land  lease  agreements  will  help \nsignificantly  lower  the  transaction  costs  for  all  types  of  planters,  especially  multinational \ncompanies  interested  in  FDI,  but  the  intended  benefits  are  hard  to  estimate.  Therefore,  the \nproject benefit stream does not include any estimate of such benefits. The approximate cost of \ninstitutional development and capacity building would amount to about 35% of the total project \ncost. Although benefits of capacity building cannot be quantified, these activities are critical to \nhelp  realize  the  benefits  of  investment  activities.  For  instance,  LPA\u2019s  Livelihood  Plantation \nDivision  and  Industrial  Plantation  Division  cannot  proceed  with  their  operations  without  inputs \nfrom  the  Land  Survey  Division\u2019s  land-use  planning  and  analysis.  Similarly,  full-package  and \none-window  services  to  SLPs,  MEPs,  SMEs,  and  LIPs  depend  on  LPA\u2019s  overall  capacity  to \ndeliver and coordinate a range of activities efficiently. This interdependence of all LPA activities \nis  critical  to  the  realization  of  overall  project  benefits.  Therefore,  institutional  development  and \ncapacity  building  in  the  Government,  by  establishing  LPA,  is  a  prerequisite  to  successfully \nimplement these activities and develop the subsector. \n \n24. \nThe Project will generate significant employment and other economic benefits in down- \nand  upstream  activities,  i.e.,  marketing,  trade,  and  processing.  Even  if  half  the  expressions  of \ninterest from the multinational companies materialize, the pace of subsector development would \nbe significant. Conservative estimates show that as much as 150,000 ha may be under LIPs by \n2015.  This  scale  of  development  would  create  significant  employment  opportunities\u2014even \n5,000  ha/year  plantation  development  will  create  500,000  person-days  of  employment.  This \nsituation would result in labor shortages, requiring increasingly mechanized means of plantation \nmanagement. This also implies higher wage rates, jobs with higher skills, more income for the \nhouseholds, and a significant multiplier effect on regional and national economies. Similarly, the \nGovernment would invest the considerable revenues raised from LIPs and industrial processing \noperations  in  social  development,  generating  further  benefits  for  society  in  general.  Rural \nhouseholds, not participating in the Project directly, will benefit from the additional demand for \nlabor in their areas from MEPs and LIPs. Many of these will be poor households. There will also \nbe a multiplier effect on the local economy of those villages and districts where cash would be \ninjected through employment, creating new business and trade opportunities. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTable A11.8: Distribution Analysis Using Discount Rate of 12% \n($, constant 2005) \n\n \n\nFactors \n\nPlanter (SLP) \n\nEntrepreneur \n(MEP) \n\n($) \n\n \n\n(%) \n\n0.00 \n\n($) \n\n \n\n(%) \n\n0.00 \n\nLPA \n\nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n($) \n\n(%) \n\n($) \n\n(%) \n\n($) \n\n1,922,936 76.00 \n\n607,243  24.00 \n\n2,530,178\n\nAdministration \n\nLabor \n\nCost \n\nMaterials \nTotal \nBenefit \n\nNPV \n\n \n\n \n\n2,279,417  53.33 \n\n270,509\n\n6.33 \n\n1,724,393 40.34 \n\n  0.00 \n\n4,274,318\n\n   0.00 \n2,279,417  27.02 \n5,134,945  54.33 \n5,134,945  65.67 \n\n255,402 15.65 \n6.23 \n525,911\n8.38 \n792,384\n6.87 \n\n536,982\n\n1,376,667 84.35 \n5,023,995 59.55 \n2,579,186 27.29 \n1,202,519 15.38 \n\n   0.00 \n607,243  7.20 \n945,168  10.00 \n945,168  12.09 \n\n1,632,069\n8,436,565\n9,451,684\n\n7,819,615\n\n  \n\n2.3 \n\n1.5 \n\n0.5 \n\n  \nBenefit/Cost Ratio \nLPA  =  Lao  Plantation  Authority,  MEP  =  medium  enterprise  plantation,  NPV  =  net  present  value,  SLP  =  small \nlivelihood plantation. \nNotes: \n1.

Rodrik suggests that \u201cdeveloping societies need to embed private \ninitiatives  in  a  framework  of  public  action  that  encourages  restructuring,  diversification,  and \ntechnological  dynamism  beyond  what  market  forces  on  their  own  would  generate\u201d.  He  also \nargues \u201cthat getting the institutional setting right, with an adequate balance between autonomy \nand  embeddedness  on  the  part  of  Government  officials,  is  far  more  important  than  worrying \nabout  the  precise  policy  instruments  to  be  deployed\u201d.  The  rationale  of  setting  up  LPA  and  its \neconomic justification rest on fundamental principles such as these. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe analysis shows that the Project is financially and economically viable and robust. All \ntypes  and  sizes  of  plantations\u2014SLPs,  MEPs,  and  LIPs\u2014will  be  financially  viable.  With  the \nfinancing  mechanism  of  equity-sharing,  LPA  can  recover  adequate  revenues  to  cover  its \ninvestment  and  operational  costs  while  providing  effective  support  to  its  clients  and  offering \nperformance-based incentives for its employees. With and without Project incomes and poverty \nimpact  ratios  assure  that  the  Project  will  have  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact  on \nparticipating poor households. LPA will generate adequate revenues to upscale its support for \nSLPs beyond the Project life. The economic analysis shows that the Project investment in SLPs \nwill be viable and robust, and that the Project has the potential to generate much greater social \nbenefits than the value of resource committed for its activities. The support for LPA is justified \nas it has enormous potential to efficiently develop the forest plantations subsector. Proximity to \nmarkets, quality of plantation lands, and LPA\u2019s semiautonomous management are possible risks \nthat will require close monitoring to achieve envisaged project benefits. \n\n                                                 \n2   Rodrik, Dani. 2004.

The  Resettlement  Framework  (RF)  and  the  Ethnic  Minority \nDevelopment Framework (EMDF) have been prepared to identify and compensate all affected \nhouseholds, including ethnic minority communities, that may be affected by the development of \nlarge  industrial  plantations  (LIPs)  and  medium-sized  enterprise  plantations  (MEPs).  Both \nframeworks  have  been  developed  in  accordance  with  various  laws  and  guidelines  of  the \nGovernment,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement1  and  policy  on  indigenous  people.2 \nThese frameworks also build upon principles being developed under other Asian Development \nBank (ADB)-funded projects in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The RF and \nEMDF will be translated into Lao and distributed to central and local agencies, companies, and \nindividuals responsible for developing LIPs and MEPs. These frameworks should also be read \nin  conjunction  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice  (1998)  and \nvarious relevant Government laws and guidelines. \n \n2. \nDuring project preparation, detailed social and poverty assessments found it necessary \nto prepare the RF and EMDF to safeguard the vulnerable groups against any negative impacts \nof  plantation  development.  As  exact  sites  for  LIPs  and  MEPs  will  be  identified  later\u2014after  the \nLao  Plantation  Authority  (LPA)  undertakes  land-use  planning\u2014these  frameworks  will  provide \nfundamental principles upon which detailed resettlement and ethnic minority development plans \nwill  be  prepared  to  determine  entitlements  for  the  affected  persons  (APs).  These  plans  will \nensure that (i) rights of all APs are protected during resettlement activities, (ii) ethnic minorities \nare not disadvantaged by virtue of their social and cultural characteristics, and (iii) all APs have \nequal access to project benefits. To ensure that ethnic minority households and villages benefit \nto the same degree as the predominantly Lao Loum villages, a community development plan for \nthese  villages  will  be  prepared  following  the  EMDF\u2019s  principles.  All  permanent  and  temporary \nimpacts of project activities will be fully addressed. \n \nGovernment  Policies  and  Laws.  This  Project  will  be  bound  by  the  principles  and \n3. \nconditions stated in the RF, and the same will supersede the provisions of relevant decrees in \nforce  in  the  Lao  PDR  wherever  a  gap  exists.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  compensation  principles  and \npolicy  framework  for  land  acquisition  are  governed  by  several  statutory  laws:  Constitution \n(1991),  Forestry  Law  (1996),  Land  Law  (1997),  and  Road  Law  (1999).  Decree  192  on \nResettlement  and  Compensation  (July  2005)  fully  meets  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  Under  the  Land  Law  (Articles  17\u201318  and  21\u201322),  land  titles,  which \nprovide provisional ownership rights to use agricultural as well as forestland, can be issued. All \nAPs\u2014whether they have land titles or temporary land-use certificates, or are unregistered\u2014will \nbe entitled to compensation for losses caused by the Project.3  \n \n4. \nImplementation, Monitoring, and Reporting. LPA will be responsible for implementing \nthe RF and EMDF and for preparing requisite plans. These plans will be prepared in accordance \nwith Government policies, laws, and decrees, and ADB policies. LPA will also be responsible for \nimplementing  these  plans,  regularly  monitoring  them,  and  reporting  to  the  Government  and \nADB. The preparation and implementation of these plans will be externally monitored during the \nProject\u2019s midterm review. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2   ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n3   People without any proof of ownership and/or land-use certificates are considered \u201cunregistered\u201d users. The Land \nLaw, however, provides mechanisms (e.g., residency or use of land by unregistered users for at least 2 years) by \nwhich individuals can apply for certification. While the Land Law ensures compensation for legal owners and users \nof  the  land,  it  does  not  guarantee  either  replacement  value  of  land  or  restoration  of  income,  or  provide  for \ncompensation to nonlegal (but not illegal) users. This is now guaranteed by Decree 192. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nPROJECT RISKS \n\n1. \nThe Project, its operations, and beneficiaries will face a variety of political, institutional, \nmarket,  business,  financial,  and  environmental  risks.  These  risks  can  be  effectively  mitigated. \nThe risks and their mitigating measures are described below. \n \nA. \n\nPolitical Risk \n\nSetting up Lao Plantation Authority (LPA) is an unprecedented and unique experiment in \n2. \nLao  PDR.  It  is  a  high-risk  but  high-gain  proposition.  LPA\u2019s operations will  be  prone  to  political \nrisks if its autonomy, staffing, and functions are compromised by interference from Government \nofficials.  On  the  other  hand,  international  investors  perceive  political  risk  because  of  the \nrelatively short time that Lao PDR has been open to foreign investment. The Law on Promotion \nand Management of Foreign Investment, 1994 protects foreign investors against appropriation \nof their assets and there is no reason to believe that the Government would not comply with its \nown law. However, in view of the unforeseen changes that have taken place in other countries, \nthis is still perceived as a distinct risk. \n \n3. \nMitigation. LPA\u2019s autonomy will be enshrined in its prime ministerial decree\u2014a sign of \nthe  highest-level  Government  commitment.  The  LPA  experiment  is  a  calculated  risk.  The \nGovernment has provided specific assurances to allow LPA to undertake its operations without \ninterference.  Specific  triggers  have  been  covenanted  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  to  suspend \nand/or  cancel  LPA  financing  if  operations  deviate  from  its  approved  work  plan.  Its  key \nmanagement staff will have a proven professional track record and provided adequate full-time \ninputs. Moreover, other stakeholders\u2014including nongovernment members of Board of Directors \n(BOD),  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  the  Government  of  Malaysia\u2014will  provide  close \nand  regular  supervision  and  monitoring  of  its  operations,  especially  in  the  first  2\u20133  formative \nyears. For the political risk of the other kind, Lanxang Oxiana Mines Company and Nam Thuen \n2  Power  Company  provide  two  of  several  other  good  examples  where  foreign  investors  have \nconsidered  Lao  PDR  a  secure  investment  environment.  ADB  may  provide  a  political  risk \nguarantee  (PRG)  facility  to  qualified  foreign  investors  in  the  plantations  subsector.  The  PRG \nfacility procedures and conditions are described in Appendix 5. Besides, establishment of LPA \nin itself would exude confidence among the potential foreign investors. \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional Risk \n\nMost of the investment capital required to establish large industrial plantations (LIPs) and \n4. \nassociated  processing  plants  will  be  raised  in  the  international  markets.  Therefore,  foreign \ninvestors  and  their  bankers  will  be  concerned  with  the  institutional  risks  of  having  to  deal  with \nmany  different  Government  agencies.  Weak  institutional  and  staff  capacity  of  Government \nagencies  also  adds  to  their  transaction  costs.  Currently,  foreign  investors  face  a  number  of \ninstitutional difficulties in obtaining approvals for investing in plantations. These mainly relate to \nidentifying and leasing suitable land and obtaining a series of licenses and permits. All lands are \nstate property in Lao PDR. But the law recognizes traditional and occupational rights of farmers \nand communities. Therefore, obtaining land for plantations involves substantial negotiations with \nlocal authorities and communities to identify land that does not have claims for other economic \nuses.  This  is  a  time-consuming  and  costly  process  and  has  almost  certainly  been  a  factor  in \ndelaying a number of potential investments. \n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59 \n\nMitigation. The Department of Domestic and Foreign Investment (DDFI) is empowered \n5. \nto provide a one-stop service to foreign investors in all sectors. This is an important contribution \nto  mitigating  the  institutional  risks  but  it  does  not  cover  the  identification  and  negotiation  of \nsuitable land for plantations. For most foreign investments, in other sectors, only limited areas of \nland  are  required  for  buildings  or  factories.  But  plantations  require  extensive  areas  and, \ntherefore,  need  special  consideration.  LPA,  with  requisite  capacity,  and  remit  to  identify, \nnegotiate, and lease suitable lands for plantations, will mitigate this risk and reduce transaction \ncosts  for  investors.  LPA  and  DDFI  would  be  able  to  jointly  provide  the  one-stop  service  to \npotential investors in this subsector. \n \nC. \n\nMarket Risk \n\nMarket risk is minimal as a number of multinational pulp and paper companies are now \n6. \nkeen to invest in this subsector. Another clear sign that the plantation log markets are coming of \nage is seen along the Route 13 South where a number of procurement depots have sprung up \nin  recent  months  by  intermediaries  of  Thai  pulp  and  paper  companies.  Although  this  is  still  a \nnascent market and information on spot prices, transport costs, and technical parameters (log \nsize  and  moisture  content)  is  still not  widely  available  to most  planters,  it  is  well on  its  way  to \nsound development. \n \nMitigation.  LPA  design  provides  for  specific  assistance  to  planters  to  mitigate  market \n7. \nrisk,  starting  with  those  of  the  Industrial  Tree  Plantation  Project  (ITPP)1  planters.  Through  a \nnumber of initiatives and actions, LPA would ensure that planters get fair prices for their logs. \nOne or two wholesale log markets will be established (one near Friendship Bridge in Vientiane \nCapital and another along Route 13 South) to help clear the market through transparent price \nand  transaction  mechanisms.  Information  on  daily  prices,  along  with  technical  parameters  in \nthese  wholesale  markets,  will  help  planters  determine  the  stumpage  price  by  discounting \nharvesting  and  transport  costs\u2014thus  minimizing  the  risk  of  being  duped  by  unscrupulous \nintermediaries.  Such  market  risks  mainly  apply  to  individual  planters.  LIP  investors  normally \nfactor  in  market  risks  to  their  investment  decisions.  The  fact  that  multinational  companies  are \ngearing  up  to  establish  LIPs  would  also  help  mitigate  the  market  risk,  as  the  commitment  of \nlarge  amounts  of  private  capital  will  more  or  less  guarantee  markets  for  plantation  log  in  the \nfuture.  Individual  planters  also  stand  to  gain  from  such  developments,  especially  those  in  the \nproximity  of  LIPs.  In  its  cluster  areas  and  where  ITPP  plantations  currently  stand,  LPA  will \nprovide marketing services. \n \nD. \n\nBusiness Risk \n\n8. \nThere are business (technical) risks that will apply to all types of plantations, i.e., quality \nof planting stock, technical know-how, fire, disease, and adverse whether conditions (drought). \nBut experienced plantation managers normally adopt measures to minimize these risks and the \ncost  is  factored  into  their  business  plans.  SLPs  and  MEPs  will  benefit  from  the  transfer  of \ntechnology from both LPA and LIPs in order to mitigate these risks. \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Risk \n\n9. \nIn  international  finance  circles,  Lao  PDR  is  perceived  as  a  high-risk  country  for \ninvestment.  This  increases  the  cost  of  borrowing  for  investors  and  may  also  deter  some  from \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1993.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grants  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Industrial  Tree  Plantation  Project. \nManila. (Loan 1295\u2013LAO).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\ncontemplating  investments  in  the  country.  In  addition  to  these  perceived  financial  risks,  the \ntransaction costs of working in Lao PDR are considered too high because of delays in obtaining \napprovals and permits, and due to inconsistencies between national laws and regulations and \nthe  way  they  are  interpreted  in  the  provinces.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  potential  financial \nrisks for the Government if some of the investors turn out to be unscrupulous or irresponsible. \nThe establishment of LPA would also pose some financial risk for the Government if it costs as \nmuch to set up and does not deliver expected outputs. \n \n10.  Mitigation. There are three ways these risks can be mitigated. First, LPA will be able to \ninvestigate  the  transaction  costs  and  have  the  authority  to  deal  with  them  by  establishing \ncommon  and  transparent  arrangements  throughout  the  country.  Second,  ADB,  through  its \nprivate sector operations, may provide cofinancing to qualified foreign investors\u2014spreading and \nmitigating  some  financial  risk.  Third,  financial  risks  to  the  Government  from  potential \nunscrupulous  investors  will  be  mitigated  by  LPA\u2019s  ability  to  undertake  due  diligence \ninvestigations of potential investors before approval. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Risk \n\n11. \n\nA recent comprehensive study on the subject concludes:  \n \u201cFast-wood forestry is neither inherently good nor inherently bad. It is neutral technology \nwhich, when poorly planned and executed, can cause grave problems; and which, when \nwell planned and executed, can deliver not just large quantities of wood, but a range of \nenvironmental and social benefits.\u201d2  \n\nHistory  is  replete  with  examples  where  exotic  species  of  crops  and  trees  have  been  highly \nsuccessfully  adopted  in  new  environments.  Adoption  of  oil  palm  and  rubber  trees  in  Malaysia \nfrom Brazil in the early 1800s is a prime example in the region. Ironically, both these trees are \nnow  more  successfully  cultivated  in  this  region  than  in  their  native  Brazil  (where  they  are \nenduring a variety of diseases and pest attacks). Conversely, the productivity of Eucalyptus is \nmuch  higher  in  its  adopted  environments  in  Latin  America  (Chile  and  Brazil)  and  South  Africa \nthan its native Australia. Its productivity was around yield class (YC) 20 in the 1970s when first \nintroduced in Brazil, but it now regularly exceeds YC40. Nevertheless, there are bad examples \nof its adoption in many places (the Congo). Despite all its failings, one of the major contributions \nof ITPP is that it has successfully demonstrated that, if Eucalyptus plantations are established \nand managed effectively, they can be environmentally safe and financially viable. \n \n12.  Mitigation.  All  types  of  plantations  will  comprise  only  a  small  portion  of  the  mosaic  of \nland-use systems in any given location. Even LIPs will not be wall-to-wall plantations, spanning \nhundreds of thousands of hectares (ha) in just one locality. Rather, LIPs will be established in \nblocks  of  200\u2013300  ha  with  buffer  zones  comprising  other  land  uses,  separating  them  from \nnatural forests. Similarly, they would keep a safe distance from streams and other water bodies \nand  will  not  be  grown  on  slopes  >20\u00b0.  A  comprehensive  set  of  environmental  and  technical \nstandards and criteria have been prepared as part of LPA\u2019s compliance function. Its plantation \nstandards  and  compliance  officer  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  codes  of  practice  and \nmonitoring  compliance.  Regular  third  party  environmental  audits  will  be  carried  out  to  monitor \ncompliance. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   Cossalter, C. and C. Pye-Smith. 2003.
