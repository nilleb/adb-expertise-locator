This is one of three projects for GMS corridor towns; the other two will be \nin Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).2 \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  towns  along  the  East\u2013West  Economic \nCorridor  (EWEC) and the  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC)  and  support  the  development of \nthe  GMS  transport  corridors  into  vibrant  economic  corridors.  The  project  will  transform  the \ncorridor  towns  of  Dong  Ha,  Lao  Bao,  and  Moc  Bai  into  economic  hubs  by  improving  urban \nenvironmental  infrastructure  and  strengthening  institutional  capacities  of  provincial  and  local \nauthorities. Increased climate resilience through flood control measures will significantly improve \nthe productivity of economic enterprises in these towns. Clean wastewater, solid-waste disposal, \nand enhanced mobility on improved urban roads will improve the environment. The project will \nprovide  environmental \ntreatment  and  solid-waste \nmanagement  specifically  will  help  to reduce  the  carbon footprint  of  these  towns,  making  them \ncleaner, greener, and more livable. The project finances 10 subprojects in the three towns.3  \n \n\ninfrastructure,  of  which  wastewater \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic  economic  development.  Improved  transport  connectivity  among  GMS \ncountries  has  intensified  urban  links  and  established  a  solid  foundation  for  more  efficient \nmovement  of  people,  goods,  and  services.  It  has  led  to  significantly  increased  trade  and \ncommerce  in  border  districts  and  corridor  towns.  The  towns  and  cities  along  the  SEC  and \nEWEC, which link Viet Nam with Cambodia and the Lao PDR, are well positioned to serve as \ndynamic  centers  of  investment  and  economic  growth.  Given  the  tremendous  economic \nopportunities,  the  corridor  towns  face  the  challenge  of  meeting  the  demands  for  urban \ninfrastructure and essential support services which are a result of rapid urban population growth \nand  urban  expansion.  With  the  proper  enabling  environment  for  strategic  local  economic \ndevelopment,  provision  of  adequate  infrastructure,  and  institutional  capacity  to  manage  future \ndevelopment,  the  corridor  towns  are  expected  to  attract  public  sector  investments  in  urban \nin  urban  economic \nenvironment \ninfrastructure. \n \n4. \nThis project is phase 1 of a long-term engagement in GMS economic corridor towns, and \nis  aligned  with  the  strategic  framework  of  the  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  2012\u2013\n2022, approved by the Fourth GMS Summit on 19\u201320 December 2011. It is also in line with the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015  for  Viet  Nam,4 and \nsupports ADB\u2019s urban operational plan, 2012\u201320205 and water operational plan, 2011\u20132020.6 \n \n                                                \n1  Contributor:  the Government of Sweden, administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntowns \n\nthe  corridor \n\nlocal  economic  development \n\nProject  areas.  Three corridor towns were selected as project areas: Dong Ha and Lao \n\nCore  problem.  The  participating  corridor  towns  in  Viet  Nam  face  the  pressing  task  of \n5. \ncoping  with  the  demands  of  a  rapidly  growing  urban  population  and  expanding  urban  areas. \nThere have been  major problems  with  the  inadequate capacity  of  local  authorities  to  plan  and \nmanage  urban  growth  in  an  integrated  way,  operate  and  maintain  urban  infrastructure,  and \nefficiently  deliver  municipal  services.  Despite  reforms  to  promote  decentralization,  local \ninstitutional  capacity  development  has  not  kept  pace  with  urban  sector  development  and \neconomic growth. With increasing trade and traffic flows, there is an urgent need to strengthen \nthe  capacities  of \nin  an \nto  manage \nenvironmentally sustainable manner. \n \n6. \nBao in Quang Tri Province and Moc Bai in Tay Ninh Province. \n \n7. \nDong Ha is on Viet Nam's east coast, north of the historic city of Hue and the port city of \nDa Nang. This corridor town is the center of political, cultural, and economic activities in Quang \nTri  Province.  It  is  located  on  the  intersection  of  National  Road  1A  and  Road  9,  which  provide \ntransport  connectivity  and  easy  access  to  the  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand  through  the  Lao  Bao\u2013\nDansavanh  border. The strategic  location  of  Dong  Ha makes  it the  leading regional  trade  and \ninvestment center along the EWEC. \n \nLao Bao  is  a  border  town along the  EWEC,  which  is an  important  trade  and  traffic  link \n8. \nbetween Viet Nam, the Lao PDR, and Thailand. The town is developing rapidly as an industrial \ntownship  for  export  of  consumer  articles.  Within  the  town  center  is  the  Lao  Bao  Border  Gate \nSpecial  Economic  and  Trade  Zone,  which  is  stimulating  economic  activity  and  providing \nemployment for local people. \n \n9. \nMoc Bai, on the border of Viet Nam and Cambodia along the SEC, is a newly emerging \ndestination for large manufacturers as well as small and medium-sized enterprises outside Ho \nChi Minh City. The national and provincial people\u2018s committees have designated the town a Tay \nNinh Province economic trade zone. Establishment of the SEC has attracted manufacturing and \nindustry locators, providing economic opportunities to local residents and migrant workers. \n \n10. \nRelated policies and strategies. The government issued a policy declaration to pursue \na balanced socioeconomic strategy through the development of key economic centers, as well \nas  secondary  cities  and  towns,  to  further  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  5-year  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan, the main pillar of Viet Nam\u2019s strategic plan, stipulated the focus of \nurban  development  on  (i)  promoting  the  linking  of  urban  and  rural  economies,  (ii)  improving \nurban planning and management, (iii) developing small and medium-sized towns and cities, and \n(iv)  developing  economic  corridors  by  building  economic  nodes  on  the  corridors.  Under  this \nstrategy,  the  functions  of  small  and  medium-sized  towns  are  crucial  in  terms  of  their  role  as \nmarkets  and  transport  hubs  for  agricultural  goods,  products  from  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises,  and  manufacturing  industries.  The  government\u2019s  strategy  is  also  reflected  in  the \nwater supply and other municipal infrastructure and services sector assessment (summary).7 \n \n11. \nLessons.  Based on the experience gained from completed ADB-financed urban sector \ndevelopment projects, the relevant lessons learned are as follows: (i) the project implementation \nschedule  should  be  carefully  assessed  during  appraisal,  taking  into  account  the  government\u2019s \nlengthy  approval  procedures;  (ii)  selecting  qualified  project  management  consultants  familiar \nwith  local  rules  and  regulations  is  important  for  successful  project  implementation;  (iii)  the \n\n                                                \n7  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Water  Supply  and  Other  Municipal  Infrastructure  and  Services  (accessible  from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nnumber  of  procurement  packages  should  be  minimized,  considering  the  workload  for  contract \nmanagement,  while  ensuring  competitiveness  among  qualified  contractors;  and  (iv)  advance \naction  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  should  be  undertaken  to  facilitate  project \nimplementation  because  consultation  and  agreement  with  affected  households \ntakes \nconsiderable  time.  The  project  design  responds  to  these  lessons  with  a  schedule  that  has \nsufficient  preparation  time,  a  limited  number  of  procurement  packages,  and  adequate  project \nmanagement support. \n\nSpecial  features.  The  project  has  three  special  features:  (i)  support  for  regional \n12. \ndevelopment in the GMS (and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) through the creation \nof  growth  engines  in  corridor  towns  across  the  GMS  countries;  (ii)  recycling  of  solid  waste \nthrough  innovative materials  recovery facilities (MRFs) for  waste segregation,  with cofinancing \nfrom  the  UEIF  of  the  UFPF;  and  (iii)  support  for  increased  decentralization  by  strengthening \nprovincial and district authorities.8 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  project  is  for  Dong  Ha  City,  Lao  Bao,  and  Moc  Bai  to \nbecome  dynamic  economic  growth  centers  in  the  EWEC  and  SEC.  The  expected  outcome  is \nadequate  and  efficient  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  Dong  Ha  City,  Lao  Bao,  and  Moc \nBai. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nPriority infrastructure. The outputs include (i) endorsement of strategic local economic \n14. \ndevelopment  plans;  (ii)  priority  infrastructure  investments;  and  (iii)  capacity  development, \nincluding a master plan for Dong Ha City.

The respective departments of planning and investment (DPIs) for Quang Tri province \nand  Tay  Ninh  Economic  Zone  Authority  are  the  implementing  agencies.  A  project  steering \ncommittee (PSC) will be created to provide overall policy guidance and oversee implementation \nfollowing  the  objectives and  scope  of  the  project.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  chair  of  the \nQuang  Tri  Province  PPC  or,  in  his  absence,  the  vice-chair.  The  vice-chair  of  the  Tay  Ninh \nProvince PPC will also serve as vice-chair of the PSC. The provincial director of the Quang Tri \nProvince  DPI  will  serve  as  the  standing  vice-chair.  The  project  management  units  will  be \nestablished in  Quang Tri Province  and Tay  Ninh Province  and will  be  managed  by the  Quang \nTri DPI and Tay Ninh Economic Zone Authority.

The  technology  for  undertaking  the  civil  works  is  within  the  capacity  of  the \nprovincial  and  district  authorities.  The  technical  and  engineering  designs,  including  the  O&M \nplan,  are  prepared  based  on  standard  parameters  to  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure.  The  national  government,  through  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan, \nenvisions  to  promote  local  economic  development  and  reduce  poverty  in  small  and  medium-\nsized towns and cities. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic analysis was undertaken for all subprojects with the computation of economic \n21. \ninternal  rate  of  return,  net  present  value,  and  benefit\u2013cost  ratio.  Benefits  that  were  quantified \nand valued included savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time for the road subprojects; \nhealth benefits, reduction in flood damage, and reduction in economic productivity time loss for \nthe drainage and flood control subprojects; economic efficiency of recovering recyclable wastes \nand reduction in costs of disposal for MRFs; and willingness to pay for water supply, wastewater \nsystem,  and  solid-waste  management.  Given  the  varying  nature  of  the  subprojects,  the \nexpected beneficiaries of the overall project also constitute a diverse group. They include road \nusers,  the  business  sector,  tourism  service  providers,  property  owners,  and  households.  The \nbase-case results indicate all components are economically viable with an estimated economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  exceeding  the  assumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%. \nResults  ranged  from  12%  to  30%.  All  subprojects  were  generally  also  viable  under  adverse \nscenarios in which costs were higher or benefits lower by 10% than the base case.11 \n \n22. \nfour  nonrevenue-generating  subprojects  (three  urban  roads  and  one  river \nembankment protection subproject), the executing agency has to provide funds through annual \nbudgetary  allocations  to  cover  the  required  O&M  costs  and  ensure  project  sustainability.  The \nfinancial analysis focused on historical annual budget allocations from the executing agency. Six \nof the 10 subprojects were considered revenue generating, thus financial internal rates of return \nwere  computed  taking  into  consideration  the  level  of  fees  that  can  be  collected  from  their \noperations. \nwaste  management,  MRF,  and  river  port  rehabilitation  subprojects.  Resulting  financial  internal \nrates  of  return  range  from  2%  to  23%,  all  above  the  computed  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital.12 \n \nC. \n\nsupply,  wastewater \n\nGovernance \n\nthe  water \n\ntreatment, \n\ninclude \n\nThese \n\nFor \n\n23. \nThe  PPCs  of  Quang  Tri  and  Tay  Ninh  provinces  will  adhere  to  the  transparency  and \naccountability  elements  of  good  governance  in  terms  of  financial  management  and  fund \ndisbursements.  Through  their  direct  participation  and  involvement  in  undertaking  procurement \nprocedures  of  an  ADB-financed  project,  the  PPCs  will  develop  their  institutional  capacity  to \nundertake international and national competitive bidding for civil works. Based on assessments \nof financial management and procurement capacity,  the provincial and district authorities have \n\n                                                \n11  Economic Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Financial Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\nsolid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nlimited  experience  in  projects funded by  official  development  assistance. Thus, the  project  will \nprovide capacity development assistance and training programs on financial management, fund \ndisbursement, and procurement procedures of ADB and the government. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n24. \nwith  the  government  and  the  PPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 10). \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nUrban poverty. Based on the household survey and the urban poverty line of D500,000 \nper  person  per month,  the  proportion  of  poor  people  in the participating towns is  9.0%  in Moc \nBai, 13.5% in Dong Ha, and 22.0% in Lao Bao. The poor live in areas where they often suffer \nfrom  serious  water  supply  shortages,  poor  water  quality,  wastewater  pollution,  poor  urban \nenvironmental sanitation, and inadequate roads and drainage. They have less capacity to cope \nwith  pollution  and  degraded  environments.  In  turn,  they  suffer  from  increased  exposure  and \nrisks  due  to  surface  water,  groundwater,  and  air  pollution,  which  further  adds  to  their  poverty \nsituation.  Through  the  implementation  of  the  subprojects,  the  project  will  improve  the  living \nenvironment  and  health  status  of  the  urban  residents,  especially  the  poor.  Poverty  reduction \nimpacts will be made by assisting poor people, especially women, in improving their skills and \naccessing employment opportunities through the measures included in the gender action plan. \nThere will be short-term employment benefits during the construction stage.13 \n \n26. \nBased  on  the  survey,  households  headed  by  women  account  for  20%\u201338%  of  the \nbeneficiary  households,  of  which  between  48%  and  63%  are  headed  by  single  women.  The \nsubprojects  will  provide  individual  and  household  benefits  to  women.  Women  are  primarily \nresponsible  for  disposing  of  wastewater,  disposing  of  and  managing  household  garbage,  and \ncaring  for  the  sick  and  elderly.  Time  and  effort  spent  on  these  activities  will  be  significantly \nreduced for women so they can engage in income-generating activities and have more family or \nleisure  time.  Lack  of  wastewater  treatment  and  solid  waste  disposal  contribute  to  gender \ninequities  in  the  burden  of  household  work.  While  both  women  and  men  will  gain  from  the \nwastewater  system  and  treatment  plant  subprojects,  women  can  benefit  in  a  number  of  other \ndirect and indirect ways. As they have primary domestic responsibilities, improving wastewater \ndisposal will ease burdens and reduce both anxiety over exposure to waterborne illnesses and \ntime spent  caring for  sick family  members  as  a  result  of  contracting  a  waterborne  illness. The \nproject  will  mitigate  any  negative  impacts.  The  gender  action  plan  includes  measures  and \nactivities that will enhance the benefits to women through participatory community development, \nemployment  during  construction,  improvements  in  sanitation  and  hygiene,  and  awareness-\nraising  programs.  The  design  and  monitoring framework  and the  PAM  include  gender-specific \ntargets. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment.  The  environment  category  for  the  project  is  B,  as  the  proposed \nsubprojects are not expected to have irreversible adverse environmental impacts; any impacts \nare easily mitigated. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) conducted for all the project cities \nidentified potential impacts and mitigation measures to be implemented through  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs).14 The IEEs also included inputs from public consultations. The IEEs \n\n                                                \n13 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Initial Environmental Examination: Dong Ha, Lao Bao, and Moc Bai Subprojects; Initial Environmental Examination: \nEnvironmental  Management  Plan  for  Dong  Ha  Subproject;  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Environmental \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nare  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the  applicable \nenvironmental regulations of the Government of Viet Nam. At the detailed design stage, when \nthe  EMPs  are  finalized  and  updated,  the  final  receiving  environments  for  the  wastewater \ntreatment plants and landfill will be reviewed to ensure that local groundwater and human uses \nof  the  areas  are  not  adversely  affected.  Estimated  costs  for  implementing  the  EMP  were \nintegrated into the project costs. The final EMP, cleared by ADB,  will form part of the contract \nbidding  documents.  Environmental  considerations  during  design  and  allocation  of  sufficient \nbudget for operation and maintenance (O&M) will help mitigate potential adverse impacts during \noperation. Effective environmental monitoring at all stages of subproject implementation will be \nensured.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  the \nsafeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n\nLand  acquisition  and \n\ninvoluntary  resettlement.  The  safeguard  category \n\nfor \n28. \ninvoluntary resettlement is A. Three resettlement plans have been prepared for the subprojects \nwhich  will  have  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts. 15  The  required  land  comprises \n101.68  hectares.  A  total  of  2,394  households,  or  10,005  people,  will  be  affected  by  land \nacquisition and resettlement in the priority subprojects of Quang Tri and Tay Ninh. Of these, the \nsubprojects in Dong Ha City will result in 1,176 affected households (4,704 affected people); in \nLao Bao, 958 (3,832 affected people); and in Moc Bai, 260 (1,469 affected people). A total of 61 \naffected households (261 affected people) require relocation: 38 (152 affected people) in Dong \nHa,  10  (261  affected  people)  in  Moc  Bai,  and  13  (52  affected  people)  in  Lao  Bao.  All  other \nimpacts are partial and temporary. The overall resettlement costs for the subprojects are $12.87 \nmillion.  A  cutoff  date  has  been  established  with  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  and \nparticipation.  Project  information  has  been  disclosed  to  affected  people  throughout  project \npreparation  and  a  project  information  booklet  will  be  updated  and  distributed  during  detailed \nmeasurement survey. \n\n29. \nResettlement and environment documents have been prepared in consultation with local \ncommunities,  agreeing  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Government  Decree  No. \n69,  2009  which  govern  resettlement  and  compensation.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information \ndisclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite. A grievance redress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding \nproject  performance.  The  resettlement  plans,  IEE,  and  EMPs  will  be  updated  and  disclosed \nafter detailed design and cleared by ADB prior to contract awards. \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  indigenous  peoples  living  near  or  close  to  the \nsubproject  sites  in  the  three  participating  corridor  towns.  The  small  number  of  indigenous \npeoples  in  any  of  the  subproject  locations  who  are  residing  in  remote  villages  will  not  be \naffected  by  the  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  The  project  is  assigned  category  C; \ntherefore, there is no need to prepare an indigenous peoples plan. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nmanagement plan and summarized in Table 5.16 \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nManagement  Plan  for  Lao  Bao  Subproject;  and  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Environmental  Management \nPlan for Moc Bai Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15 Resettlement Plan: Dong Ha Subproject; Resettlement Plan: Lao Bao Subproject; and Resettlement Plan: Moc Bai \n\nSubproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCorridor  towns  are  unable  to  generate  revenues  from \nwater supply and wastewater treatment in Moc Bai, solid-\nwaste management in Lao Bao, and port rehabilitation in \nDong Ha. \n\nTechnical  and  administrative  capacities  of  project  staff \nare  inadequate  for  project  management  and  continued \nO&M  of  urban  infrastructure.
