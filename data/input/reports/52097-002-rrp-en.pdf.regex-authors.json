THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  Mugling\u2013Pokhara \nHighway Improvement Phase 1 Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for Enhancing Road Safety, Disaster Risk Reduction, and Project Implementation Capacity, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will improve the capacity, reliability, and safety of road links between Pokhara, \nNepal\u2019s second-largest city, and Mugling, a central junction of the strategic road network (SRN) \nthat further links to Kathmandu, the administrative and economic capital; and Bharatpur, Nepal\u2019s \nfourth-largest city and a gateway to the East\u2013West Highway and international markets. The \nproject will finance the first phase of upgrading Mugling\u2013Pokhara Highway, and will (i) rehabilitate \nand widen to four lanes the 81-kilometer (km) section between Abukhaireni and Pokhara, and (ii) \nincrease awareness and strengthen the capacity of the Department of Roads (DOR) in road safety \nand disaster risk reduction. A second phase, covering the 8 km section between Mugling and \nAbukhaireni, will be considered as a subsequent project because of engineering constraints.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country context. Nepal is landlocked and bordered to the north by the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and to the south, east, and west by India. Consequently, Nepal relies heavily on its \ndirect neighbors for international trade, mainly India which traded 65% of Nepal\u2019s imports and \nexports in fiscal year (FY) 2019. Economic growth improved to 7.3% per year on average during \nFY2017\u2013FY2019, compared with an annual average of 3.3% during FY2014\u2013FY2016. However, \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  largely  depends  on  exogenous  factors,  such  as \nremittances, which accounted for 25.4% of GDP in FY2019; and rainfall, as agriculture accounted \nfor 27% of GDP in FY2019.2 Nepal\u2019s economy suffers from a lack of competitiveness and is \nparticularly hampered by its deficient infrastructure network and the resulting high operating costs \nand travel times, which (i) constrain the development of competitive export supply chains,3 (ii) \nhinder the exploitation of its natural resources and tourism potential,4 and (iii) impede regional \nintegration and trade with indirect neighbors.5 \n \n                                                \n1  The 8 km, two-lane section between Mugling and Abukhaireni cannot be widened to four lanes because of steep \nslopes and the presence of a hydropower plant. A second project phase will thus include (i) the construction of a \ngreenfield, two-lane alignment on the opposite side of the valley between Mugling and Abukhaireni; and (ii) the \nrehabilitation and improvement of the two-lane section. Feasibility and detailed design studies are ongoing for phase \n2, which is under consideration for financing in 2021. \n2  ADB. 2019.

Nepal Foreign Trade Statistics, Fiscal Year 2018/19 (2075/76). \nKathmandu. Exports decreased by 3.6% annually and in real terms from FY2009 to FY2019. Sustained by foreign \nremittances, which increased from 2.0% of GDP in 2000 to 25.4% in 2019, imports grew by 9.2% from FY2009 to \nFY2019. \n4  World Travel & Tourism Council. 2018. Travel & Tourism Economic Impact 2017. London. The contribution of tourism \nto Nepal\u2019s economy is estimated at 7.5% of GDP, supporting about 0.95 million jobs. Tourist arrivals exceeded 1 \nmillion in 2018, but remain significantly below Nepal\u2019s natural, historical, and cultural potential, and below the \ngovernment\u2019s ambition of reaching 2 million tourists by 2020. \n5  Excluding India, trade with other South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) members accounts for \n0.7% of Nepal\u2019s trade. SASEC members are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Transport sector. Roads are the predominant mode of transport for more than 90% of \ngoods and passengers, although road density remains low at 47 km of road per 100 square \nkilometers of land area, and 2.5 km per 1,000 people.6 The SRN totals 12,494 km, 51% of which \nis paved, and is developed and maintained by the DOR in the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure \nand Transport (MOPIT). The number of registered vehicles increased from 0.7 million in FY2009 \nto 3.2 million in FY2018, and motorcycles accounted for 79.6% of sales. Vehicle registrations are \nexpected to quadruple by 2029, highlighting the need to increase capacity. The high traffic fatality \nrate of 15.9 fatalities per 100,000 people also mandates road safety improvements, notably by \nstrengthening road designs.7 The SRN maintenance budget increased by 10.0% annually and in \nreal terms during FY2013\u2013FY2020; however, the average budget utilization of 81% requires \nimprovements in asset management and planning practices. International and domestic air travel \nincreased by 7.2% and 2.0% annually during 2011\u20132018, but capacity constraints at Kathmandu \nairport inhibit growth.8 \n \n5.  Sector road map. The transport sector is guided by the National Transport Policy, 2002; \nthe Priority Investment Plan, 2007\u20132016; and MOPIT\u2019s 5-year strategic plan.9 The road sector \nstrategy of the government\u2019s Fourteenth Plan, 2017\u20132019 aims to (i) expand the SRN to improve \ninterprovincial and national connectivity; (ii) promote economic growth through higher regional \nintegration; (iii) reconstruct roads damaged by the April 2015 earthquake; (iv) provide greater \naccess to social services and markets; (v) improve road safety and road maintenance; and (vi) \nsupport the development of the agriculture, industry, energy, and tourism sectors.10 \n \n6.  Subregional cooperation. The government strategy is aligned with subregional policies, \nnotably SASEC\u2019s objectives to facilitate trade, enhance accessibility to national and transnational \nmarkets, and improve connectivity through the development of multimodal transport systems.11 \nThe improvement of the East\u2013West Highway\u2014Nepal\u2019s main domestic and international trade \ncorridor\u2014and of its feeder roads is recognized by the government and development partners as \na priority to implement the strategies. The project is part of a comprehensive set of interventions \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government, and the World Bank to improve Nepal\u2019s \nmajor highways.12 The project is consistent with the objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Nepal, 2013\u20132017 to enhance global\u2013local connectivity, and is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019\u20132021; and in SASEC\u2019s operational plan, 2016\u20132025.13 \n \n7.  Regional context. Pokhara is the capital of the Gandaki Province and has a population \nof about 450,000 people in 2019. It is a major economic and social hub for its hinterland, although \nPokhara\u2019s location at the foot of the Himalayas impedes connectivity and restricts access to \nmarkets, jobs, and social opportunities. The sinuous 200 km journey to Kathmandu takes over 5 \nhours by road. There are no railway or waterway connections, and its domestic airport handled \n                                                \n6  Compared with 12.2 km of road per 1,000 people in Bhutan, 4.1 km in India, and 5.5 km in Sri Lanka. \n7  World Health Organization. 2018.

A new regional international airport in Pokhara will alleviate the \ncapacity constraints of the existing airport and is expected to be completed in 2021. Despite poor \ntransport links, Pokhara\u2019s attractive environment makes it a primary tourism destination, and it \nwelcomed about 376,000 international visitors in 2017 (40% of all international arrivals in Nepal, \nup from 22% in 2001).14 \n \n8.  Project design. The project road is the primary access link of Pokhara to Kathmandu and \nis a major feeder road of two SASEC corridors linking Kathmandu to Dhaka (Bangladesh) and \nKolkata (India) through Mugling and the East\u2013West Highway. It is a two-lane carriageway that \nhandles about 7,400 vehicles per day, including 14% of goods vehicles and up to 55% of \nmotorcycles in urban areas. Traffic is forecast to increase to 13,000 vehicles per day by 2040, \nand the rising number of motorcycles creates significant road safety risks, notably as (i) the road \nwinds through the mid-hill region of Nepal and its geometry can be improved, (ii) slow-moving \nvehicles and pedestrians are not segregated in urban areas, and (iii) the pavement is in poor \ncondition.15 The road will be widened to four lanes to cater to increasing demand, and design \nstandards will feature enhanced geometry, pavement, structure, drainage, safety, and intelligent \ntraffic system features to improve sustainability, safety awareness, and safety compliance. The \nroad will be median divided, and service lanes in urban areas will improve safety, particularly for \nwomen and children, who are more likely to walk, ride a bicycle, or use public transport than men. \n \n9.  Project  benefits.  The  project  will  directly  support  economic  growth  by  (i)  lowering \ntransport costs and reducing logistics constraints; (ii) improving accessibility to domestic markets, \njobs, and social services; (iii) enhancing national connectivity between Pokhara and Kathmandu; \nand (iv) facilitating access to international markets through Bharatpur and India. Consequently, \nthe project is expected to (i) promote the development of the private sector and competitive export \nsupply chains in Pokhara and its hinterland, (ii) increase domestic and international trade, (iii) \nimprove regional integration, and (iv) leverage Pokhara\u2019s tourism potential. The project will also \nincrease connectivity and urban road safety for the major settlements located between Mugling \nand  Pokhara,  and  strengthen  disaster  resilience  by  installing  a  landslide  monitoring  and \nmanagement system and replacing the structurally weak Madi bridge. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s interventions and lessons learned. ADB is a leading partner for the development \nof the SRN and has financed five projects from 2010 to 2018 to improve about 1,212 km of road, \ntotaling $690.8 million.16 The project design incorporates lessons from previous projects, notably \non (i) project preparation: a preparatory facility financed the detailed design to minimize initial \nimplementation delays, and the project is procurement ready;17 (ii) procurement: three large works \npackages are expected to attract experienced international contractors and improve the quality of \nworks; (iii) material availability: a consulting services package will be carried out to assess \nnationwide  material  availability  and  quality;  (iv)  disaster  risk  resilience:  climate  adaptation \nmeasures and the attached TA will strengthen landslide monitoring and management capacity; \nand  (v)  asset  sustainability:  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  will  ensure  funding \n                                                \n14 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation. 2016.

While performance-based \nmaintenance contracts will promote private sector participation, and recent improvements in \npolitical stability reduce investment risks, the potential for private sector financing and public\u2013\nprivate partnerships remains limited and justifies the need for public sector involvement. \n \n11.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The project will contribute to achieving the following \noperational priorities:18 \n \n(i)  Accelerating progress in gender equality. The project will (a) promote women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment by reducing time poverty and improving access to social, \nhealth, job, and market opportunities; (b) target women in awareness campaigns \non road safety, disaster risk reduction, HIV/AIDS, sexual harassment, abuse, \nexploitation, and human trafficking; and (c) target vulnerable and women-headed \naffected households in livelihood improvement programs. \n(ii)  Tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and \nenhancing environmental sustainability. Significant disaster risk reduction and \nclimate adaptation measures, totaling 15.6% of civil works costs, will strengthen \ndisaster risk resilience. The attached TA will also develop a landslide monitoring \nand management system to mitigate environmental sustainability risks. \n(iii)  Strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The project will improve \n(a) service delivery through the civil works contracts, which were designed to \nimprove works quality, improve the completion timeline, and promote private sector \nparticipation  in  the  road  maintenance  during  operation;  and  (b)  institutional \ncapacity in traffic management, procurement, and contract management. \n(iv)  Fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  project  will  enhance \nconnectivity and competitiveness to promote regional trade, tourism, and value \nchains; and is aligned with SASEC\u2019s strategy and operations plan (footnote 11). \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) transport connectivity within Nepal \nand  with  neighboring  countries  improved  (footnote  10),  and  (ii)  physical  connectivity  and \nmultimodal linkages for land-based transport along major trade routes enhanced (footnote 11). \nThe project will have the following outcome: efficiency and safety of the road transport system \nimproved.19 \n \n13.  Output 1: Road network upgraded and maintained. The loan will finance the upgrading \nof about 81 km of road between Abukhaireni and Pokhara from two to four lanes, and feature (i) \nimproved safety, including crash barriers in hilly areas, and service lanes for pedestrians, bicycles, \nand motorcycle users in urban areas; (ii) intelligent transport system equipment, such as traffic \nlights and warning systems; and (iii) enhanced sustainability, with a 5-year performance-based \nmaintenance period. The project road includes nine major bridges, including two for which a \nseparate civil works contract package is provided, in addition to 26 minor bridges. \n \n14.

Development coordination. The project complements and strengthens best practices \nintroduced in previous projects in safety, maintenance, procurement, and gender mainstreaming. \nIt is closely aligned with SASEC\u2019s strategy, which aims to promote trade along specific identified \ncross-border corridors, and aligns with interventions of development partners, particularly (i) the \nWorld Bank, which financed the upgrading of Mugling\u2013Narayanghat Road, completed in 2018, \nand is expected to finance Mugling\u2013Naubise Road; and (ii) the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, which is financing the Naubise\u2013Nagdhunga tunnel. ADB is expected to continue to \nfinance strategic roads, including phase 2 from Mugling to Abukhaireni (footnote 1), and other \nsections of the East\u2013West Highway that are part of the SASEC corridor, in 2021\u20132022. In addition \nto closely cooperating on infrastructure development planning, ADB and the World Bank align \ntheir institutional development strategies, particularly on road safety and maintenance. \n \nD.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n21.  The transaction TA for Enhancing Road Safety, Disaster Risk Reduction, and Project \nImplementation Capacity will complement infrastructure improvements by supporting capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening of MOPIT and DOR. The TA will support three outputs: \n \n(i)  intelligent traffic management and information system for road safety developed, \nincluding the design of a safety-oriented plan to incorporate intelligent transport \nsystems and road safety technologies in the project road; \n(ii)  landslide  monitoring  and  management  system  for  disaster  risk  reduction \ndeveloped,  including  the  identification  of  landslide-sensitive  areas  and  the \npreparation of a risk monitoring and reduction plan; and \n(iii)  procurement and contract management capacity enhanced, including training \ncourses on procurement of works, contract management, and dispute resolution \nunder the International Federation of Consulting Engineers. \n \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).22 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, data, maps, and other in-kind contributions. Equipment \npackages under the loan will support the implementation of the intelligent traffic management and \ninformation system, and of the landslide monitoring and management system. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  DOR prepared the engineering designs of the project road in accordance with the Asian \nHighway  Class  1  standard,  and  aimed  to  improve  road  safety  and  geometry,  avoid  land \nacquisition, and minimize social and environmental impacts. The project road will be widened \nfrom two to four lanes, and the completed road will have a design speed of 80 km per hour, dual \ncarriageways  separated  by  a  3-meter  median,  3-meter  shoulders  on both  sides,  and  new \npavements. The project will integrate safe and socially inclusive design features, such as 41 km \nof footpaths, 20 km of service lanes segregating slow-moving vehicles, 46 disabled-friendly \npedestrian crossings, 46 sheltered bus stops, and reflective lane markers.  \n \n24.  The project road is in the subtropical climate zone with high rainfall and heat hazard risks, \nhigh rainfall-induced landslide risks in sections of the road traversing steep terrain, medium \nearthquake risk, and very low river flooding risks. The main climate risks in the project area are \ntemperatures increasing by 1.2\u00b0C\u20131.7\u00b0C during 2019\u20132050, rainfall levels increasing by 15%\u2013\n                                                \n22 Attached  Technical  Assistance  Report:  Enhancing  Road  Safety,  Disaster  Risk  Reduction,  and  Project \nImplementation Capacity (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n20% during 2019\u20132050, and extreme rainfall increasing in frequency. To address these risks, \nengineering designs of the road and bridges have integrated climate adaptation measures, \nincluding slope protection works, increased road embankment and bridge heights, and increased \ncross and side drainage capacity. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic viability. The economic evaluation of the project followed ADB guidelines and \ncompared life cycle economic costs and benefits in with- and without-project scenarios, using a \n9.0% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria.23 The \nhighway development model 4 was used to estimate road agency and road user costs based on \ninput data on traffic; road geometry; pavement condition; and maintenance, improvement, and \noperating costs. The analysis considered the project costs of the entire Mugling\u2013Pokhara corridor, \nincluding phase 2 of the project. Project benefits include savings associated with vehicle operating \ncosts, travel time, and road accidents (unquantified). The EIRR of the project is estimated at \n13.9%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the economic viability of the project \nunder adverse changes in costs and benefits, with an EIRR of 11.9% under the most sensitive \nscenario involving a 10% increase in capital costs and 10% decrease in benefits. \n \n26.  Financial viability. The project is not revenue generating, and cost recovery will not be \nsought. The Roads Board of Nepal funds maintenance from allocations of the Ministry of Finance \nand from toll revenues. The annual SRN maintenance budget increased from NRs2.7 billion in \nFY2013 to NRs8.0 billion in FY2020 in nominal terms, or an annual growth rate of 16.7% in \nnominal terms and 10.0% in real terms. The project\u2019s average annual incremental recurrent costs \nare estimated at 0.75% of the maintenance budget, and it is thus reasonable to expect that DOR\u2019s \nbudget allocation will be able to meet the project\u2019s incremental maintenance costs, particularly \nconsidering that the road is a major highway and trading corridor of Nepal.24 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  The FY2020 budget, which doubled the allocation for road maintenance, also introduced \na tax of NRe1.0 per liter of fuel and diesel to be channeled toward road maintenance. Despite the \nincreasing commitment of the government and the minimal impact of the project on DOR\u2019s \nmaintenance budget, the historical underfunding of road maintenance still represents a risk to the \nproject\u2019s sustainability, as the maintenance budget could be channeled toward other roads \nrequiring more urgent maintenance. Consequently, the project design incorporated the following \nmeasures to mitigate the risk of funding availability and strengthen the project\u2019s sustainability: \n(i)  Civil  works  contracts  include  a  1-year  defect  liability  period  and  a  5-year \nperformance-based maintenance period under the responsibility of the contractors \nafter construction. This will strengthen works quality by the contractor, promote \nprivate sector participation in the maintenance of the project road  under the \nsupervision  of  DOR,  and  guarantee  the  availability  of  budget  and  physical \nresources in the initial phase of operation. \n(ii)  The project design includes adaptation measures estimated at 15.6% of capital \ncosts, compared with about 5.0% for most road projects, which represent a \nstrengthening of technical specifications against assessed environmental and \nclimate risks. The attached TA will also support institutional capacity improvements \nin landslide management and disaster risk reduction. \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n24  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Institutional capacity. The 2015 Constitution of Nepal, which introduced three tiers of \ngovernment, entrusted the development and management of the national highway network to the \nfederal government, under MOPIT and DOR. The Project Directorate (ADB) of DOR, which \nhandles project management for ADB\u2019s strategic road sector projects, has good technical capacity \nand significant experience implementing ADB projects. Its project director reports to DOR\u2019s \ndirector general, who in turn reports to the MOPIT\u2019s secretary. The capacity of DOR will be \nstrengthened through consulting services contracts for (i) construction supervision, which include \ntraining in design, contract management, and quality assurance; (ii) an independent design \nchecking for third-party review and approval of bridge designs; and (iii) a raw material survey to \nassess raw material availability, quantity, and quality for construction projects across Nepal. \n \n29.  Financial  management.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate  mainly  because  DOR  has  an  established  record  in  implementing  ADB-financed \nprojects, and adequate financial management capacity in accounting, disbursement procedures, \nand reporting. All transactions are recorded by government accounting systems, reflected in \ngovernment  accounts,  and  subjected  to  statutory  audit  by  the  comptroller.  The  project \nmanagement  unit  maintains  separate  books  of  accounts  following  government  accounting \nstandards, under the cash basis of accounting; and prepares annual project financial statements, \nwhich  are  audited  by  Nepal\u2019s  Office  of  the  Auditor  General.  The  financial  management \nassessment identified the following risks: (i) increasing financial management requirements, \nparticularly with the increasing project pipeline, coupled with frequent project staff turnover; (ii) \nlack of comprehensive financial information in periodic project progress reports; and (iii) weak \ninternal audit. The main risk mitigation actions include (i) assigning additional financial staff to \nproject field offices, (ii) ensuring proper training in ADB systems and procedures, and (iii) including \nadditional financial information in the quarterly progress reports as agreed with ADB. \n \n30.  Procurement. Procurement and consultant recruitment will follow the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The amended Public Procurement Act (2017) and Public \nProcurement Regulations (2017) of Nepal are generally acceptable to ADB and encompass best \ninternational procurement practices. While Nepal\u2019s procurement risk rating is substantial, DOR \nhas significant experience with ADB\u2019s procurement requirements, and the sector and project \nprocurement risks are moderate. Engagement of all consulting firms will use the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Advance actions for the recruitment of \nconstruction supervision consultants started in August 2019, and invitation for bids for the two \nroad packages were published in September 2019. \n \n31.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.25 No significant integrity risks were identified. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and MOPIT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Poverty. The direct area of influence of the project includes 456,273 residents living in 10 \nmunicipalities crossed by the project road, in the districts of Kaski and Tanahu. About 11.8% of \n                                                \n25 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n ", "10 \nresidents live below the national poverty line, below the national average of 18.7%. The major \nincome sources are remittances (22%), agriculture (21%), trade (20%), and services (12%). \nAccess to sanitation (99%) and piped water (95%) is high. The project is expected to improve \naccess to economic opportunities and social services, reduce intraregional disparities, promote \nthe development of trade and tourism, and encourage the creation of competitive export jobs and \nservices; the project is also expected to create about 1.65 million person-days of skilled and \nunskilled employment during construction. \n \n33.  Gender. The project is categorized some gender elements. A poverty and social analysis \nassessed the socioeconomic characteristics of 1,297 households\u2014including 322 households \nheaded by women\u2014representing 6,828 people, 50% of them women and girls. Overall, women \nwere supportive of the positive impact that the project will deliver, including expected increased \naccessibility to education and health facilities, reduced travel time, and expanded access to \nagricultural products and job markets. The gender benefits of the project also include (i) a safer \nurban environment, with infrastructure features friendly to elderly people, women, children, and \npeople with disabilities; (ii) livelihood improvement programs prioritizing  vulnerable affected \nhouseholds and affected households headed by women; (iii) ensured participation of women in \nawareness programs on road safety, disaster risk reduction, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking; \nand (iv) ensured participation of female MOPIT and DOR staff on capacity building activities. \nGender, social development, livelihood improvement, and road safety awareness experts will be \nhired to support the gender activities of the project. \n \n34.  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. HIV prevalence in Nepal is low,  at 0.2% of the \npopulation aged 15\u201349.26 About 39 HIV incidences were recorded in the districts affected by the \nproject, while about 50 nongovernment organizations work in HIV prevention. Human trafficking \nin Nepal remains prevalent, with an estimated 5,957 cases of abducted persons in FY2016 (80% \ninvolving women and children, primarily for forced labor and sexual exploitation). While the project \nwill facilitate movements of people and require a significant labor force, it will widen an existing \ncorridor and is not expected to contribute to a significant increase in HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking. The project will recruit a nongovernment organization to conduct an HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking awareness campaign along the road corridor. The contractors will also conduct \nHIV/AIDS awareness sessions and provide voluntary testing and guidance to their workforce. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). The project road will be rehabilitated and widened to four \nlanes in the existing right-of-way, and the road is not located in or near any environmentally \nsensitive area. The environmental impacts of the project are not expected to be significant and \nirreversible, and will be mainly restricted to the construction stage. Anticipated impacts involve \nlandslide  and  erosion,  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  construction  and  domestic  waste,  water \ncontamination, occupational health and safety, siltation, traffic congestion during construction, \nand air pollution and road safety during operation. An initial environmental examination has been \nprepared for the project and was disclosed on the ADB website in July 2019; it includes an \nenvironmental management plan providing mandatory mitigation measures to be implemented by \ncontractors. Concerns voiced by affected persons and stakeholders during project preparation \n                                                \n26 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Education. 2014.

Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \nwere incorporated in the design, and a grievance redress mechanism will alleviate concerns \nduring  implementation.  About  6,694  trees  will  need  to  be  removed  and  a  compensatory \nafforestation program will be implemented, with a ratio of 25 saplings planted for each felled tree. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will require private land acquisition \nof 1.28 hectares, where the existing alignment is insufficient to meet the requirements of the \nproject design, mainly at intersections and bridges. The project will affect 143 private land parcels \nbelonging to 122 households, with parcels mostly comprising small strips of uncultivated (1.21 \nha) and cultivated (0.07 ha) land on either side of the existing road. There is no major impact on \nthe income of affected households arising from the loss of land. \n \n38.  The project will affect 810 households (3,985 persons) and 767 private structures along \nthe right-of-way; 85% of affected households are non-titled, and only 4% are below the poverty \nline. A resettlement plan was prepared for the project road and is disclosed on the ADB website.28 \nThe entitlement matrix provided under the resettlement plan includes mitigation measures and \nresettlement  assistance  commensurate  with the  project  impacts;  incorporates  lessons from \nprevious projects; and provides compensation at replacement cost for land, structures and trees, \nshifting  and  reconstruction  assistance,  loss  of  income,  and  livelihood  measures.  Public \nconsultations  were  undertaken  from  2016  to  May  2019  and  will  continue  as  the  plan  is \nimplemented. An adequate grievance redress mechanism is in place at the project level, in \naddition to the provisions for redress under the Land Acquisition Act of Nepal (1977). Livelihood \nmeasures will particularly target vulnerable households and households headed by women. \nInstitutional arrangements and capacity to implement the plan are adequate. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project road does not cross traditional customary \nor tribal lands. More than half of affected households belong to various ethnic groups recognized \nby the government (mainly Dalit, Gurung, Magar, and Newar); however, they share the same \nincome-generating  activities  and  access  to  services  and  opportunities  as  other  affected \nhouseholds. The social impact assessment also indicates that households from these groups tend \nto have a higher socioeconomic status than others, are well integrated, will not be impacted \ndifferently, and will benefit equally from the project. The project will also not impact the dignity, \nhuman rights, livelihood systems, or culture of ethnic groups; or affect the territories or the natural \nand  cultural  resources  that  they  own,  use,  or  occupy.  Cultural  aspects  were  considered \nparticularly during public consultations, information disclosure, livelihood improvement measures, \nand the grievance redress mechanism. \n \n40.  Implementation. DOR is experienced and has adequate institutional capacity regarding \nADB\u2019s procedures and requirements, and the Project Directorate (ADB) will implement the \nenvironmental safeguards and resettlement plan. Resettlement and environment specialists will \nsupport the Project Directorate (ADB) in guiding and reviewing the implementation of safeguard \nplans and documentation. Environmental, gender, and social experts from the construction \nsupervision consultants will assist DOR with the implementation and monitoring of safeguard and \ngender activities. Contractors will be required to have environmental, health, and safety officers \nto ensure the environmental management plan is properly implemented. An external monitor will \nprovide a third-party review of the resettlement plan. The government will finance and implement \nenvironmental and resettlement activities. Detailed implementation arrangements are in the PAM. \n \n                                                \n28 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nG.
