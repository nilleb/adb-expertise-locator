The  report  also describes \nthe proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction for Strengthening Capacity for Comprehensive Primary Health Care in Urban \nAreas, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  India  launched  the  Ayushman  Bharat  (the  Healthy  India  Initiative) \nHealth and Wellness Centres (AB-HWC) in 2018 to improve access to comprehensive primary \nhealth care (CPHC) as an important strategy to achieve universal health coverage. In 2020, the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  revealed  gaps  in  the  health  system,  so  the \ngovernment announced the Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PM-ASBY) to \nstrengthen public health systems to prepare for future pandemics and other emergencies. The \nproposed  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program will  assist the  government  in implementing  the \nAB-HWC and the PM-ASBY to strengthen primary health care in the urban areas of 13 selected \nstates, and improve the urban population\u2019s access to quality CPHC services.1 The RBL program \ntarget  beneficiaries  are  more  than  256 million  urban  dwellers,  including  51  million  urban  slum \ndwellers, especially the poor and vulnerable. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIndia is one of the fast-growing large economies, with average growth of more than 6.7% \nfrom 2015 to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic hit India\u2019s economy hard\u2014it contracted 23.9% in \nApril\u2013June 2020 because of the strict lockdown from late March to late May, and is projected to \ncontract 9.0% in FY2021.2 The recovery may take longer if the pandemic is prolonged. About 70 \nmillion  people  are  likely  to  be  pushed  into  extreme  poverty. 3 COVID-19  and  the  associated \nlockdown disrupted many routine and essential health services, undermining progress made on \nseveral health goals, such as maternal and infant health, tuberculosis and malaria treatment, and \nnoncommunicable  diseases  (NCDs). 4  The  negative  mental  and  physical  health  impacts  of \nCOVID-19, especially on vulnerable populations such as the urban migrant population and the \nelderly, will require longer-term health system responses. \n \n4. \nCurrent health status. From 1990 to 2017, India has seen substantial improvements in \nbasic health indicators: life expectancy increased by 8.9 years to 67.8 for men and by 9.8 years \nto 70.2 for women. Maternal deaths per 100,000 live births declined from 408 to 160 in the same \nperiod.  The  greatest  achievement  has  been  the  reduction  of  under-five  mortality\u2014from  111  to \n42 deaths per 1,000 live births. Tuberculosis declined by 29% and malaria incidence fell by 76%.5 \n\n \n\n1  Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, \nRajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  Telangana,  and  West  Bengal  were  selected  based  on  the  size  of  their  urban  and  slum \npopulations as well as the growth rate of the urban population, the overall health system performance ranking by \nNITI Aayog (for a mix of well-performing and less well-performing states), previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupport in urban health, and ADB\u2019s urban development sector support. \n\n2  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila. \n3  ADB staff estimation based on the economic contraction estimated in the ADO Update. \n4  World  Health  Organization.  2020.  Pulse  survey  on  continuity  of  essential  health  services  during  the  COVID-19 \n\npandemic. Geneva. \n\n5  All data are from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Health-Related SDGs (accessed 23 April 2020). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nDespite these achievements, India still accounts for 27% of TB and 4% of malaria cases in the \nworld,6 and  has  the  third  largest  number  of  people  living  with  HIV.  It  also  faces  the  spread  of \nvector-borne  diseases  such  as  dengue  and  chikungunya.7 For  COVID-19,  India  has  reported \nmore than 8.2 million confirmed cases, the second highest number after the United States as of \n2 November 2020.8 Despite the countrywide lockdown for more than 50 days from 25 March 2020 \nand increased testing capacity (more than 1.5 million samples per day) to detect and isolate cases, \nCOVID-19 cases are still increasing at an alarming rate. In addition, the demographic transition \ncaused by increased life expectancy and changing lifestyles from rapid urbanization have led to \na rise in NCDs. Cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes are major NCDs in \nIndia  that  kill  about  4  million  Indians  annually,  and  most  of  these  deaths  are  premature.9 This \nepidemiological  transition  leads  to  more  NCD  patients  with  disabilities,  which  poses  a  heavy \nfinancial  burden on  the health  system  and  affected  households.  Given the ongoing  COVID-19 \npandemic,  people  with  underlying  conditions,  particularly  NCDs,  are  also  at  increased  risk  of \nmortality during hospitalization.  \n \n5. \nUrban health issues. In 2018, 461 million people or one-third of the Indian population \nwere  living  in  cities,  which  is  the  second  largest  urban  population  in  the  world. 10 The  urban \npopulation  is  growing  rapidly,  and  by  2050  will  reach  877  million\u2014almost  two-thirds  of  India\u2019s \npopulation.11 Urban  populations  grew  faster  than  most  cities\u2019  capacity  to  provide  basic  social \nservices for all. Despite the common perception of easier access to health services in urban areas \nbecause of the large presence of private sector providers, health indicators of the urban poor are \noften comparable to or worse than those of the rural population. Full immunization among children \naged 12\u201323 months is 57.7% for the urban poor compared with 61.3% for the rural population. \nAnemic children comprise 62.7% of the urban poor compared with 59.5% of the rural population. \nMost  urban  poor  women  do  not  seek  preventive  health  measures:  among  urban  poor  women \naged  15\u201349  years,  only  20.0%  have  undergone  cervical  examinations,  9.3%  have  had  breast \nexaminations, and 10.3% have received oral cavity examinations.12 The NCD burden is higher in \nurban areas, and the urban poor are particularly vulnerable to communicable and vector-borne \ndiseases because of congested and poor living and health conditions. The risk of the spread of \nCOVID-19 is 1.09 times higher in urban areas and 1.89 times higher in urban slums compared \nwith rural areas based on the results of the first sero-survey conducted nationwide.13 More than \none-third (35%) of all COVID-19 cases in India are concentrated in 20 cities or districts.14 \n \n6. \nSupply and demand constraints in urban primary health care. Private health providers \ndominate in urban areas. However, a large number of urban poor cannot access these services \nbecause  of  the  possibility  of  incurring  high  out-of-pocket  expenditures.  Drugs  and  diagnostic \nservices make up 75% of out-of-pocket expenditures, which could be avoided if services were \n\n \n\n6  The Global Fund. 2019. Country Impact Report: India. Geneva. \n7  O.

However, it is limited to secondary and tertiary care, which treat more severe conditions \nthat  require  specialized  knowledge  and  more  intensive  health  monitoring.  The  public  sector  is \nalso  far  less  expensive and  caters  to  vulnerable  population  groups.16 In  addition  to  the  cost  of \nhealth services, especially in the private sector, the poor and vulnerable population\u2019s access to \nprimary health care in urban areas is hampered by the poor quality of available services, poor \nhealth-seeking behaviors, lack of information and awareness of health care options, constraints \nsuch  as  working  hours,  mobility,  and  other  physical  and  social  barriers.  Women\u2019s  access  to \nprimary health care is inadequate because of lack of empowerment and financial barriers: 63% \nof married women cannot take decisions related to their own health, and only 57% of women in \nurban areas can freely visit a health facility alone.17 Further, limited availability of female doctors \n(17% of doctors) hinders women from seeking care.18 \n \n7. \nAchievements and remaining gaps in urban public primary health care system. To \naddress  the  large  gaps  in  urban  primary  health  care,  especially  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable \npopulations, the government launched the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) in 2013 as part \nof  the  National  Health  Mission  (NHM).  By  2019,  the  NUHM  had  established  more  than  4,500 \nfunctional urban primary health centers (UPHCs) across India, significantly improving the urban \npopulation\u2019s  access  to  maternal  and  child  health  care;  and  implemented  key  mechanisms  for \nurban health system governance and management.19 UPHCs have also played a crucial role in \nthe COVID-19 response through surveillance, contact tracing, and test referrals. Overall, primary \nhealth care in India prioritizes a narrow range of services such as reproductive and child health \nservices and selected communicable diseases. Currently, even a well-functioning primary health \ncenter  provides  limited services  that cater  to  less  than  15%  of  all morbidities for  which  people \nseek  health  care.20 For  other  morbidities,  people  use  local  private  care  providers,  distant  and \ncrowded district hospitals, or government medical college hospitals. Investment in primary health \ncare  is  cost-effective  and  can  reduce  overall  health  costs. 21  The  public  sector  has  also \ncollaborated with the private sector in selected aspects of primary health care delivery, such as \ncontracting in of specialist services, mobile medical units for improved outreach, and biomedical \nwaste management. To strengthen private sector engagement, some states have contracted out \nthe  entire  management  and  service  provision  of  primary  health  service  centers  to  the  private \nsector, usually nonprofit entities. The UPHCs need further improvement in infrastructure, human \nresources, and the availability of diagnostics and drugs. Outreach services also face challenges\u2014\nfrom  a  high  attrition  rate  of  community  health  workers,  inadequate  community  organizations, \nunreached pockets of vulnerable populations, and poor health-seeking behavior of the urban poor. \nGaps  in  the  health  system  have  become  even  more  apparent  during  the  pandemic,  where \nsignificantly  underfunded  and  patchy  public  health  systems,  coupled  with  large  variations  in \n\n \n\n15 National Health System Resource Center. 2012.

The  National  Health  Policy  (2017)  emphasized  CPHC  as  an \nimportant strategy to achieve universal health coverage and committed two-thirds of the health \nbudget  to  primary  health  care.23 In  addition  to  the  services  already  provided,  CPHC  includes \npreventive,  promotive,  curative,  rehabilitative,  and  palliative  care.  In  February  2018,  the \ngovernment  announced  a  plan  to  develop  150,000  HWCs  in  rural  and  urban  areas  by  mainly \ntransforming  existing  primary  health  centers  into  HWCs  under  AB-HWC  as  a  vehicle  to \noperationalize  CPHC.  HWCs  will  offer  a  range  of  services  including  reproductive,  maternal, \nneonatal,  and  child  health  care;  adolescent  care;  the  management  of  national  communicable \ndisease  programs;  general  outpatient  and  minor  ailments  care;  screening,  prevention,  control, \nand management  of  NCDs;  common  ophthalmic,  ear,  nose,  and  throat  care;  basic  oral  health \ncare; elderly and palliative care; emergency medical services, including burns and trauma; and \nscreening and basic management of mental health illnesses. \n \nIn March 2020, the government announced the $2 billion COVID-19 Response and Health \n9. \nSystems  Preparedness  Project  to  carry  out  immediate  emergency  responses  through  the \nprovision  of  personal  protective  equipment,  enhanced  surveillance,  improved  health  facilities, \ntraining  of  health  workers,  testing  and  tracking  for  the  containment  of  COVID-19,  and  other \nnational  and  state  health  system  strengthening  efforts. 24  The  continued  pandemic  led  the \ngovernment to take a longer-term approach to system strengthening. It launched the PM-ASBY \nin May 2020 to develop the capacity of health systems and institutions across the continuum of \ncare (primary, secondary, and tertiary levels) to respond effectively to the current pandemic while \nbuilding resilience for future emergencies. The PM-ASBY will be implemented from FY2021 to \nFY2026 and  will  cover  (i)  continued  COVID-19  emergency  responses, (ii) strengthening  public \nhealth  infrastructure  for  pandemic  preparedness,  and  (iii)  strengthening  national  systems  for \npandemic and health emergencies.25 Under the PM-ASBY, an additional 10,380 urban HWCs will \nbe established across India; and about 20% of existing UPHCs will become polyclinics offering \nspecialist services, to augment AB-HWC toward CPHC. Several development partners, including \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  have  supported  the  COVID-19  response  project  and  will \nsupport  the  government  in  the  PM-ASBY  implementation,  contributing  to  a  common  results \nframework under the coordination of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). \n \n\np. 544. \n\n \n\n22 P.

More  details  are  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Health  (accessible  from  the list  of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n25 Key elements of  strengthening public health infrastructure include setting up rural and urban HWCs, block public \nhealth units in economically weaker states, integrated public health laboratories in all the districts, and critical care \nhospital blocks in high burden districts and government medical colleges. In addition, the scheme has specific support \nto national systems, which include several key elements such as biosecurity preparedness and research (the One \nHealth Initiative), the national digital health mission, strengthening ports of entry, health emergency operation centers \nand mobile hospitals, surveillance of infectious diseases and outbreak response, and critical care hospital blocks in \ncentral  hospitals.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  support  the  PM-ASBY  with  $1  billion,  which  would  be \nprocessed in four phases. The proposed RBL is the first phase, focusing on urban health. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fStrategic  alignment.  The  RBL  program  will  assist  the  MOHFW  in  implementing  the          \n\nProgram Rationale \n\nB. \n \n10. \nAB-HWC and the PM-ASBY to achieve the goal of CPHC in urban areas by improving equitable \naccess to quality primary health services among the urban population. It is aligned with the country \npartnership  strategy  pillar  2:  providing  inclusive  access  to  social  services  by  providing  better \nservices  for  the  urban  poor. 26 It  also  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities: \n(i) addressing remaining  poverty  and reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in gender \nequality,  (iii) making  cities  more  livable,  and  (iv)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity. The program is included in ADB\u2019s India country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023.27 \n \n11. \nLessons. ADB has supported the NUHM since 2015 and recently provided support for \nIndia\u2019s COVID-19 response.28 The lessons from the NUHM support, according to the Independent \nEvaluation  Department,  include  the  following:  (i)  outcome-level  disbursement-linked  indicators \n(DLIs) need to be within the direct control of the program, (ii) meaningful gender targets should \nbe  set,  and  (iii)  independent  verification  should  be  used.29 The  RBL  program  will  incorporate \nlessons from the NUHM implementation and the COVID-19 response, such as (i) capacity building \nof  lower  performing  states  through  cross-learning  and  need-based  programs  rather  than \nspreading  efforts  thinly  over  the  country;  (ii)  strengthening  state-level  planning  for  CPHC  by \nclosely  involving  state  and  substate  administrators  for  convergence  with other  urban  services, \nespecially leveraging the experience of the COVID-19 response where a whole-of-government \napproach  has  been  adopted;  (iii) continuously  fostering  innovations  and  partnerships  with  the \nprivate  sector  through  DLIs;  (iv) strengthening  outreach  services  for  unreached  pockets  of \nvulnerable populations; and (v) leveraging information technology for evidence-based planning, \neffective service delivery, safer and more efficient training, and emergency responses. \n \n12. \nResults-based  lending.  The  RBL  modality  is  suitable  since  (i)  RBL  incentivizes \nstakeholders to adopt new areas such as NCDs and better client orientation, while strengthening \nexisting systems using robust DLIs for change management and strengthening of systems and \ninstitutions;  (ii)  the  government  programs  have  a  well-defined  scope,  expected  results, \nexpenditure framework, financing plan, and accompanying institutions and systems; (iii) a large \nnumber of HWCs dispersed across several states require support to deliver sector results and \nstrengthen  program  institutions  through  a  systems-based  approach;  (iv)  strong  government \ninterest and ownership is in place; (v) it builds on earlier RBL program implementation experience \nand knowledge of the sector; and (vi) it enhances development coordination and harmonization \namong development partners in the PM-ASBY support. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s value addition. Only a few development partners have been supporting the urban \nhealth agenda in India, but with COVID-19, more partners are beginning to prioritize urban health \nunder the PM-ASBY. The program will complement the initiatives of the government and other \ndevelopment  partners,  and  will  promote  synergy  among  ADB-supported  interventions  in  the \nhealth sector, including the COVID-19 response project (footnote 24).

The outcome will be equitable access to quality CPHC services in urban \nareas improved in 13 states (measured by increased utilization of urban HWC [DLI 1], increased \nNCD screening [DLI 2], and increased access of urban women to antenatal care [DLI 3]). The \ntarget beneficiaries will be the urban population of more than 256 million, including the urban slum \npopulation of 51 million and the vulnerable population in the 13 states. Selected DLIs, identified \nunder  each  output,  will  exert  stakeholder  efforts  to  achieve  the  outcome  indicator.30 The  ADB \nfinancing allocation per DLI is in Table 2. \n \n16. \nOutput 1: Comprehensive primary health care services in urban areas strengthened. \nThe first output covers supply-side interventions to roll out CPHC in urban areas: (i) an increased \nnumber  of  HWCs  that  meet  the  standards  of  CPHC  guidelines  in  urban  areas  (DLI  4); 31 \n(ii) increased  screening  of  five  key  NCDs  at  the  HWCs,  aligned  with  India\u2019s  priority  to  reduce \nNCDs by 25% by 2025 (program action plan [PAP]); (iii) monitoring the availability of essential \nmedicines at urban HWCs (PAP); (iv) strengthening the mechanism for screening and referral of \ninfectious diseases, including COVID-19 suspected cases, to hospitals and laboratories for testing \nand case management (PAP); and (v) increased provision of specialist services through urban \nHWCs to offer the expanded range of services (DLI 5). \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Support  for  improved  health-seeking  behavior  increased.  The  second \noutput  will  support  demand-side  interventions  such  as  improving  health-seeking  behavior  in \npatients, patient satisfaction in the HWCs, and the use of primary health care services through \noutreach. The overall objective of this output will be supported through (i) urban HWCs to improve \noutreach services in urban areas using information, education, and communication messages to \npotential patients on health and nutrition (DLI 6[i]); (ii) strengthening frontline workers\u2019 capacity in \nrisk  communication  and  health  promotion  to  enhance  communities\u2019  knowledge  of  preventive \nmeasures and strategies against NCDs, COVID-19, and other communicable diseases (DLI 6[ii]); \nand (iii) an increasing number of urban HWCs capturing patient satisfaction information to reflect \nuser demand in continuous improvement of service delivery (DLI 7). \n \nOutput 3: Health systems strengthened. This output will strengthen systemic elements \n18. \nfor delivering urban primary health care, including digital tools, quality assurance mechanisms, \nhuman resources, and scalable models to engage the private sector to partner in improving health \noutcomes. It will support (i) the establishment of a technical division for urban health (DLI 8[i]); \n(ii) strengthening of state and substate capacity in urban health planning through convergence \nwith other urban services (DLI 8[ii]); (iii) increased adoption of innovative approaches and best \npractices, including private sector engagement (DLI 8 [iii]); and (iv) strengthening of the quality \nassurance  system  in  HWCs  through  Kayakalp,  a  national  award  scheme  that  promotes \ncleanliness, hygiene, and infection control practices in public health facilities, which are important \ngiven the escalation of the COVID-19 crisis in India (DLI 9). Areas such as technology systems \n\n \n\n30 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n31 Well-functioning HWCs require (i) strong institutional capacity for urban health at central, state, and municipal levels; \n(ii) expanded  services;  (iii)  well-maintained  infrastructure;  (iv)  human  resources,  equipment,  diagnostics,  and \nmedicine; (v) improved quality of care, including increased accountability, accreditation, and enforcement for quality \nassurance; (vi) effective referral mechanisms for the continuum of care; (vii) detailed and updated patient records; \n(viii) effective  community  outreach  to  increase  health-seeking  behavior;  and  (ix)  robust  information  technology \nsystems for data analysis and decision support.

The  RBL  program  expenditures  are  estimated \n$1,128.9 million from FY2021 to FY2024 (Table 3). The expenditures are mostly recurrent, as the \nNUHM  will  support  human  resources,  drugs,  diagnostics,  consumables,  rental,  information \ntechnology systems, and untied grants for utilities and other small expenses in urban HWCs. A \nsmaller  capital  budget  (less  than  2%)  is  allocated  to  support  and/or  establish  new  HWCs  by \nrenovating rented spaces and providing the necessary equipment, furniture, and other fixtures. \n \n \n\nExpenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n32 These include (i) the approval of the PM-ASBY, including an increased number of and resources for urban HWCs; \n(ii) a guidance note issued on enabling the delivery of essential health services during the COVID-19 outbreak, with \na focus on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health care; (iii) the structure or organogram and \nroles  and  responsibilities  of  the  technical  division  for  urban  health  finalized;  and  (iv)  online  training  for  self-\nassessment tools for the quality assurance system made accessible to urban HWCs. \n\n33 ADB. 2015.

The government has requested a regular loan of $300,000,000 from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 20-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line  method,  the  average  maturity  is  12.75  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium \npayable  to  ADB.  The  government  may  request  ADB  to  provide  additional  financing  upon \nsatisfactory  implementation  of  the  RBL  program,  to  bridge  any  financing  gap  from  FY2025  to \nFY2026.

Disbursements  will  be  made  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements \nagreed  between  the  government  and  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  consolidated  fund.  A  rigorous  verification  protocol,  including  an  independent \nverification  agency,  has  been  developed.  ADB  disbursement  will  be  made  following  the \nachievement and independent verification of the agreed DLIs. Critical actions that are required to \nachieve subsequent performance targets are identified as prior results (footnote 32). The prior \nresults linked to $60 million are expected to be achieved within 12 months before the loan signing. \n \nF. \n \n23. \nThe RBL program has identified areas for institutional capacity and systems strengthening. \nIn addition to the technical and gender actions, several actions are identified to strengthen the \nprogram systems: (i) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) such as further development of the HWC \nportal functions and increasing HWC portal uptake, streamlining the data collection process, and \ntraining  for  HWC  data  management;  (ii)  financial  management  through  gap  assessment  and \nimprovements in fund flow, accounting, internal control, and financial reporting in selected states; \n(iii) procurement through improved planning and facility level training to prevent drug shortages; \nand (iv) safeguards for improved biomedical waste and infection control management in quality \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nassurance  guidelines  and  regular  reporting.  These  actions  are  summarized  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1) as well as the PAP.34 \n \nG. \n \nTo support effective implementation of the RBL program, ADB will provide a TA grant.35 \n24. \nThe outputs of the TA are (i) core technical support for program implementation and coordination \nprovided; (ii) strategic capacity building supported in key CPHC areas (e.g., convergence, private \nsector participation, continuum of care, primary health care management, community processes, \nand leveraging information and communication technology); and (iii) innovation and knowledge-\ninto-practice  supported.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $2,200,000,  of  which  $2,000,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \nThe government will support the TA in the form of counterpart staff, office and meeting facilities, \noffice supplies, coordination assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The TA duration will be \nJanuary 2021 to December 2023.  \n \nH. \n \n25. \nThe RBL program will be implemented following the well-established NHM mechanisms, \nrelying on the urban health program management personnel at state, district, and city levels. The \nMOHFW  will  be  the  executing  agency,  responsible  for  overall  program  implementation, \ncoordinating  program  activities,  and  supporting  state-level  activities,  assisted  by  the  existing \nnational  program  management  unit  and  technical  resource  organizations.  The  states  will \nimplement  the  RBL  program  activities  based  on  the  annually  approved  state  program \nimplementation plans. The states will also prepare periodic reports on progress in meeting DLIs \nand the PAP as part of their regular reporting on overall NUHM implementation. The MOHFW will \nconsolidate state-level reports and submit periodic progress reports on the achievement of DLIs \nand  PAP  and  other  key  performance  indicators,  and  prepare  DLI  achievement  reports  for \nindependent verification. Once the verification report is submitted by the independent verification \nagency, the MOHFW will submit the withdrawal application for disbursement. \n \n26. \nDevelopment coordination. Partners play a key role in supporting the central and state \nlevel implementation of disease control programs and system strengthening efforts. In response \nto  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  government\u2019s  $2  billion  Response  and  Health  Systems \nPreparedness  Project  was  supported  both  financially  and  technically  by  several  partners, \nincluding ADB, the World Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The government\u2019s \nPM-ASBY will require external assistance estimated at $2,930 million for FY2021\u2013FY2026. This \nwill require support from several development partners, including ADB, the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nand  the  World  Bank.  Partners  will  contribute  toward  a  common  results  framework  under  the \nMOHFW\u2019s  coordination  to  define  the  scope,  expected  results,  expenditure  framework,  and \nfinancing  plan  of  the  proposed  interventions.  In  addition,  for  effective  coordination  of \nimplementation  issues  and  TA  needs,  an  informal  platform  hosted  by  the  World  Health \nOrganization  provides  the  opportunity  to  share  information  and  lessons.  ADB,  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  the  Government  of  Norway,  the  United  Nations  Population \nFund, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank \nparticipate in the bimonthly meetings of this group. \n \n\n34 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \nThe RBL program\u2019s soundness was assessed based on its relevance and adequacy. The \n27. \nprogram is highly relevant to India\u2019s universal health coverage agenda as well as sustainable and \ninclusive urban development. It will improve the health and well-being of the urban population, \nespecially  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable,  providing  equitable  access  to  a  wider  range  of  quality \nhealth services. The constraints on the cost-effectiveness of primary health care, disproportionate \nbenefits  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  free  services,  and  health  emergency  preparedness, \njustify public provision of essential health services. In addition, the RBL program aims to facilitate \npartnerships with private health service providers  to improve service coverage and availability, \nand to ensure speedy expansion leveraging the large private sector presence in urban areas. The \nRBL program will strengthen convergence with other urban services, building on the experience \nof India\u2019s COVID-19 response. \n \nThe RBL program design and implementation arrangements are sound, building on NHM \n28. \nmechanisms  and  previous  RBL  program  experience.  The  results  framework  is  well  designed, \nfollowing a health systems approach. The DLIs are critical indicators for achieving overall program \nresults, sequenced to incentivize good performance. The expenditure framework and financing \nplan  are  robust.  The  sustainability  of  the  results  will  be  ensured  through  gender-responsive \ninstitutional capacity development and the development of a state-level road map for CPHC. The \neconomic  analysis  shows  that  the  positive  effects  of  reduced  out-of-pocket  expenses  and \nincreased productivity outweigh the program\u2019s economic costs. The estimated economic rate of \nreturn of 13.1% indicates that the program is economically viable. \n \n29. \nThe RBL program is categorized gender equity as a theme. It has a strong gender and \npro-poor focus. In addition to a wider range of services made available for the urban poor, the \nRBL program includes DLIs for improved outreach services and frontline health workers\u2019 capacity \nto support and facilitate access to services and health-seeking behaviors among the poor and the \nvulnerable, especially women and girls in urban areas. The RBL program includes specific actions \nand targets that will benefit women, such as (i) HWCs offering screening for cervical cancer and \nbreast cancer (PAP); (ii) outreach services that address gender-based violence issues (DLI 6[i]); \n(iii) employment for 40% women at the new urban health technical division (DLI 8 [i]); and (iv) a \nsection on gender-responsive service provision in the revised CPHC guidelines, as well as state \nroad  maps  for  CPHC  in  urban  areas  (DLI  8  [i]  and  [ii]).  Accredited  social  health  activists  and \nMahila Arogya Samitis (community women\u2019s groups), who are 90% women, will also benefit from \nthe  trainings  on  infectious  disease  response.  The  expanded  service  package  includes  mental \nhealth screening and support, which will be important to address the psychological impact of a \nprolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent socioeconomic hardships. \n \nB. \n \n30.  Monitoring and evaluation systems. The RBL program\u2019s M&E processes across central, \nstate, district, and facility levels are well defined, functional, and sufficiently robust for tracking the \nprogram outcomes and outputs, which are a subset of the PM-ASBY\u2019s common results framework. \nThe RBL program\u2019s M&E system for periodic review, supervision, and monitoring is largely based \non  the  HWC  portal,  an  information  system  developed  in  2019  and  maintained  by  the  National \nHealth Systems Resource Centre at MOHFW. The HWC portal is being used by HWCs and NHM \nstate and city program managers, and is complemented by other information systems developed \nunder the NHM, such as the health management information system, quarterly progress reports, \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fcommon review missions, the Integrated Health Information Platform, information from accredited \nsocial  health  activists,  and  the  quality  improvement  micro-site.  Areas  for  further  strengthening \ninclude (i) enhancing state-level reporting in the HWC portal, (ii) streamlining data entry processes \nor mechanisms across multiple information systems to increase efficiency, and (iii) developing the \ncapacity of data entry operators and management information system officers. \n \n31. \nFiduciary systems. The financial management, procurement, and anticorruption systems \nassessments confirm that the existing program systems are adequate for the RBL program with \nsome risk mitigation measures.36 The overall financial management risk is substantial. Areas for \nimprovement include: (i) the NUHM financial management framework is not consistently applied \nby all states; (ii) states have varying levels of staff capacity and apply different fund flow models, \naccounting systems, and processes; and (iii) recurring control issues and audit observations are \nnot systematically followed up and addressed. ADB will support the Financial Management Group \nunder  the  MOHFW  and  the  states  to  address  these  issues.  The  PAP  includes  the  following \nmeasures: (i) the MOFHW conduct assessment of practices and gaps in bookkeeping, accounts \nstaffing, reporting, management and flow of funds, and tracking or follow-up of audit observations \nto identify good practices and deliver training and capacity building in financial management; and \n(ii) the MOHFW will submit 6-monthly financial management progress reports to ADB. \n \n32. \nThe  RBL  program  procurement  includes  drugs, consumables, furniture, and equipment \nfor  HWCs,  consulting,  and  other  services  required  for  the  CPHC  rollout.  The  program \nprocurement system has improved since the inception of the NUHM in 2013, especially with the \nrollout  of  e-procurement  nationwide.  The  overall  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  Areas  for \nimprovement  in  some  states  include  (i)  the  availability  of  adequately  trained  staff,  (ii)  effective \nprocurement planning to avoid delays, and (iii) supply management to ensure the availability of \nessential  drugs.  These  areas  will  be  supported  by  (i)  procurement  training,  assisted  by  ADB\u2019s \nCapacity  Development  Resource  Center,  with  online  modules;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  for \ntracking  drug  stocks  at  the  facility  level.  The  RBL  program  will  strengthen  the  continued \nimplementation  of  the  NHM  Governance  and  Accountability  Framework,  grievance  redress \nmechanism, and community processes in service delivery monitoring. The Guidelines to Prevent \nor  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to and discussed with the government and the MOHFW.37 \n \n33. \nSafeguard systems. The RBL program\u2019s overall safeguard risk is moderate based on the \ninitial safeguards screening. The program is category B for the environment and category C for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Urban HWCs will be established by refurbishing \nexisting  centers  and  rented  spaces  in  existing  buildings,  so  no  new  construction  or  land \nacquisition  is  envisaged.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  include  biomedical  waste  and \ninfection  risks  during  operation.  An  assessment  of  the  program  safeguard  systems  has  been \ncarried out to examine the program\u2019s environmental safeguard frameworks and practices against \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) principles. The assessment found that a wide range of \nrelevant  policies,  laws,  and  regulations  are  in  place.  Due  diligence  confirms  that  the  program \nfaces  no  known  programmatic,  contextual,  or  institutional  risks.  The  existing  mechanisms  in \nbiomedical  waste  management  and  health  and  safety  measures  are  adequate  to  mitigate  the \nprogram\u2019s environmental impacts. PAP will strengthen the existing mechanisms to guide urban-\nspecific  practices  and  enhanced  health  and  safety  measures  against  COVID-19  and  future \n\n \n\n36 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in Results-Based Lending for \nPrograms in Appendix 5 of the Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fpandemics  (footnote 34).

The prolonged COVID-19 pandemic \nmay hinder urban population from accessing \nHWC services. \nVarying capacities of states may undermine \nthe overall program progress and \ndisbursement, as DLIs are mostly measured \nin aggregate. \nExpenditures. COVID-19-induced economic \ncontraction may lead to lack of state \nfinancing to keep up with financing needs. \nFiduciary. Different state financial \nmanagement practices and capacity, and \nlack of systemic follow-up of audit \nobservations, may lead to fiduciary issues. \nProcurement.
