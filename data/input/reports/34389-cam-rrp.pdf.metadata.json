The four subprograms will be implemented back-to-back with \neach  succeeding  subprogram  to  be  processed  sequentially  upon \ncompletion of the preceding subprogram.  \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth; governance \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets;\nfinancial and economic governance \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nSocial Sector  Involuntary resettlement: Category C. \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n   \nThe Program   Since  1999,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been \nRationale   supporting the Government in its efforts to develop the financial \nsector including the formulation of the Financial Sector Development \nBlueprint (2001\u20132010). The Government adopted the blueprint in \nAugust 2001, and implementation began in earnest with the first \nFinancial Sector Program (FSP I) and associated TA. As a result of \nFSP  I,  the  Government  was  able  to  establish  the  legal  and \nregulatory foundations necessary for a sound and market-oriented \nfinancial sector; and take strong measures to consolidate banking \nand  introduce  more  stringent  requirements  for  capital  adequacy, \ngovernance, and risk management. Despite the progress, a number \nof negative factors inherited from the turbulent past persist. The \nformal financial system needs to be developed to be more efficient \nand accessible to ordinary citizens.  \n \nWith a rapidly growing commercial economy that requires a sound \nfinancial  system  to  sustain  the  rate  of  growth,  the  Government \nneeds  to  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing  financial \nresources,  channeling  them  to  productive  investments,  and \nmanaging the inherent risks, if it is to achieve long-term sustainable \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. The Asian financial crisis \nprovided many examples of the devastating impact that financial \ncrises can have on countries, wiping out several years of growth \nwithin a very short time. Thus to promote economic growth, reduce ", "ii   \n \npoverty,  and  help  countries  avoid  financial  crises,  ADB  has  an \nimportant role in supporting financial sector development in its client \ncountries.  \n \nThe program loan cluster will support the Government\u2019s continued \nefforts  to  strengthen  the  financial  sector  by  supporting  a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity \nbuilding, improved disclosure standards and financial transparency, \nand establishment of key financial infrastructure. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth;  it  will  help  reduce  poverty  by \nincreasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic \nactivities, and extending the outreach of the formal financial sector \nto poor and rural areas. An efficient financial system will promote \nprivate sector development and foreign direct investment. A robust \nfinancial  sector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable \nexogenous shocks that are becoming more common in increasingly \nglobal financial markets.  \n   \nObjective and Scope  FSP II aims to promote the development of a sound, market-based \nfinancial system to support resource mobilization and sustainable \neconomic growth. With a growing, resilient, and efficient financial \nsystem as the expected outcome, FSP II will focus on the following \nactivities: \n(i)  Improve confidence and financial intermediation by upgrading \nthe payments, clearance, and settlement system to support \ngrowing financial services; enhancing market confidence by \nimproving public financial disclosure and establishing a credit \ninformation  bureau;  establishing  a  registry  for  tradable \ngovernment securities to support the interbank market; and \nimproving the outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in a \nsustainable manner.  \n(ii)  Maintain  stability  in  the  financial  sector  by  revising  and \nupdating  the  law  on  banking  and  financial  institutions,  and \nrelated regulations to support financial activities; strengthening \nprudential  supervision  and  regulations  of  banks  and \nmicrofinance  institutions;  and  enhancing  the  legal  and \nregulatory foundation by drafting a new law on commercial \ncontracts  that  includes  specific  sections  on  agencies  and \nfranchising. \n(iii)  Promote  good  governance  by  implementing  international \ninitiatives on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of \nterrorism; enhancing corporate governance and transparency \nin  the  insurance  industry;  establishing  commercial  dispute \nresolution  mechanisms;  and  improving  the  capability  and \nincreasing the number of qualified national accountants and \nauditors. \n(iv)  Enhance  efficiency  by  computerizing  the  management \ninformation system of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC); \nand upgrading the skills and capacity of microfinance agencies \nstaff.   ", "iii \nLoan Amount and Terms A  loan  of  $10,000,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s\n  Special Funds resources for subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-\n  year term including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of \n1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  \n   \nProgram Period and   The implementation period for subprogram 1 is from September \nTranching  2006\u2013December 2007. The loan will be released in a single tranche \nupon completion of specific tranche conditions and following loan \neffectiveness. \n   \nExecuting Agency  NBC will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC) the implementing \nagencies. The Financial Sector Steering Committee, established for \nFSP I, comprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, NBC, and other \ngovernment agencies concerned, will meet as required to review \nprogress reports from the technical working group, consider pending \nissues, and propose concrete actions to resolve these issues. A \nsenior NBC officer will be appointed as program director to assist \nNBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in  coordinating  day-to-day  program \nimplementation; and will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB \non program implementation. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement of goods and services produced in, and originating \nfrom ADB member countries will be made with due consideration to \neconomy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard  public \nprocedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices acceptable to ADB. In accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to Cambodia as the Borrower.  \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  Program implementation could face a number of risks, for which \nmitigation measures have been put in place, as appropriate.  \n(i)  Exogenous  shocks.  The  external  environment  may \ndeteriorate  if  persistently  high  oil  prices  impede  world \neconomic growth and trade, and create unfavorable conditions \nin  world  financial  markets.  External  shocks  would  result  in \nslower growth in Cambodia. To a certain extent, this risk could \nbe mitigated by oil extraction from Cambodia\u2019s own petroleum \ndeposits.  To  date,  Cambodia  continues  to  show  a  high \nresilience to oil price shocks. Concerns also focus on the high \ngrowth in credit over the past 2 years. Along with foreign direct \ninvestment inflows, rapid credit expansion is adding to growth \nin real estate investment because of rising property prices, and \nis  causing  the  assets  of  some  banks  to  be  increasingly \nvulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  Throughout  FSP  II,  the \n ", "iv   \n \nGovernment and ADB will undertake periodic macroeconomic \nreviews to assess potential risks to the financial sector. \n \n(ii)  Unexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia  has  been \nenjoying very high political unity and stability for several years. \nHowever the national election scheduled for July 2008, while it \nmay not pose a political risk, could cause material risk in terms \nof  delaying  the  law-making  process  during  the  preelection \nperiod. Subprogram 1 is designed to ensure that most of the \nlegal  drafting  that  closely  involves  midlevel  officials  will  be \ndone prior to the general election. Once the Government is \nformed,  hopefully  in  2008,  draft  laws  would  be  ready  for \nsubmission to the Council of Ministers for discussion.  \n \n(iii)  Weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak \ngovernance and incidents of corruption could erode investor \nconfidence  and  prevent  the  attainment  of  expected  sector \noutcomes. The Government\u2019s National Strategic Development \nPlan  2006\u20132010  views  corruption  as  a  threat  to  sustained \ngrowth and development of the country in general. Backed by \nan  active  development  community,  the  Government  is \nincreasingly taking a tougher stance against corruption. The \ngeneral consensus is that good governance and measures to \naddress corruption are needed for a successful partnership \nbetween the Government and the development community. \nThis was considered during design of the program cluster, \nwhich will continue targeted improvements to the institutional \ngovernance  structure,  accounting  disclosure  standards, \nfinancial transparency, complementary legislation, regulatory \nupdates and enforcement, supervision, and surveillance.  \n \n(iv)  Vested  interests  may  slow  reform.  Resistance of vested \ninterests to the reforms could delay program implementation or \nweaken its impact. This risk is considered moderate since the \nGovernment has shown immense commitment by persistently \npursuing the reform agenda under FSP I and recently adopted \nthe  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy  2006\u20132015  (an \nupdated version of the 2001\u20132010 blueprint). Institutionalizing \ngovernance reforms in NBC, MEF, and MOC is likely to be a \nlong process and the strategic approach of the program cluster \nis  to  focus  on  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives  to \n(a)  promote  integrity  in  the  regulation  and  supervision  of \nbanks,  insurance  companies,  and  microfinance  institutions, \n(b) promote transparency in the decision-making process and \nensure  that  information  is  readily  available  to  market \nparticipants, and (c) strengthen the capacity of the various \nsupervisory financial institutions.  \n(v)  Weak institutional and human capacity. Some risks may be \nassociated with weak institutional and human capacity. The \nsame applies to the implementation and enforcement of new ", "v \nlaws  and  regulations.  To  mitigate  those  risks,  training \nprograms have been initiated at various training institutions \nestablished during FSP I. FSP II provides financial support to \nthe institutions to help update their curriculum. The attached \nadvisory TA will reduce the risks arising from weak capacity, \nespecially in the implementation of new concepts. With these \ndesign  safeguards,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impact  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB will provide TA ($1.7 million) to support NBC, MEF, and MOC \nin  implementing  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms  under \nsubprogram 1 and reform triggers for subprogram 2, as well as to \nprovide the Government with timely policy advice as needed. The \nTA\u2019s objective is to provide assistance to the Government to find \npractical solutions to address these issues, as well as to deepen the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  in  the  financial  sector.  The  TA  is \nestimated to cost a total of $2.0 million equivalent. ADB will provide \n$750,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Cofinancing will include \n$500,000 from the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (funded \nby the Republic of Korea), and $450,000 from the Financial Sector \nDevelopment  Partnership  Fund  (funded  by  the  Government  of \nLuxembourg).  ADB  will  administer  the  co-financing  component. \nNBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  will  provide  the  remaining  $300,000 \nequivalent in the form of office space, counterpart staff, and other \nsupport  facilities.  The  main  TA  activities  include  support  for  (i) \nmodernization of the payments, clearance, and settlement system; \n(ii)  implementation  of  the  information  technology  component  to \ncomputerize  NBC\u2019s  core  functions;  (iii) bank  supervision  and \nsurveillance;  (iv)  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  for  anti-money \nlaundering  surveillance;  (v) supervision  and  regulations  of \nmicrofinance  institutions;  (vi) establishing  a  national  arbitration \ncenter; (vii) training under the Center for Bank Studies; and (viii) \nlegal and regulatory development. ADB will engage the consultants \non an individual basis to implement the TA activities, in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) using the competitive selection method. \nNBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  the \nimplementing agencies. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Financial Sector Program Cluster \n(FSP II), comprising four subprograms; and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1. The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for implementing FSP II, and if the Board \napproves the proposed program cluster and loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, will approve the TA and administration of the TA cofinancing.1 The program \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n2.  Sustained  High  Economic  Growth.  Cambodia\u2019s  economy  continues  to  expand \nstrongly. Growth has averaged over 10% per annum since 2004, reaching a record 13.5% in \n2005. Economic growth is expected to moderate to 9.5% in 2007. Key indicators for 2001\u20132006 \n(Table 1) show the strong macroeconomic performance. Strong economic growth has been \nlargely driven by continued high exports in garments, rising receipts from tourism, and a \nbooming construction sector since 2004. Exports expanded by an estimated 27% in 2006 with \ngarment exports growing by 21% (garment exports account for 74% of total merchandise \nexports).  Economic  growth  is  gradually  becoming  broad-based  with  increasing  growth  in \nservices and the agriculture sector. \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators \nIndicators  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nReal GDP growth rate (%)  8.0  6.5  8.5  10.0  13.5  10.8 \nInflation rate (average annual %)  0.3  3.3  1.2  3.9  5.8  4.7 \nBroad money (% of GDP)  13.0  15.6  16.3  18.4  18.4  20.5 \nFiscal position (% deficit to GDP)  (5.2)  (6.3)  (5.9)  (4.7)  (3.4)  (1.5) \nCurrent account (% of GDP)  (8.6)  (9.4)  (10.6)  (8.2)  (9.4)  (7.2) \nForeign reserves (months of imports)  3.1  3.4  3.3  3.0  2.8  2.8 \nGDP in absolute value ($ million)  3,980  4,273  4,656  5,315  6,278  7,265 \nExchange rate (average)  3,924  3,917  3,979  4,019  4097  4107 \n  ( ) = negative number, GDP = gross domestic product. \n  Sources: National Bank of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, and Ministry of Economy and Finance \n \n3.  Macroeconomic Conditions. Inflation remains relatively low on a regional comparison, \nanchored by the high degree of dollarization in the economy. At a low of 2.8% in 2006, inflation \nincreased to 3.95% by mid-2007 primarily due to rising food prices. The nominal riel exchange \nrate remains stable with modest appreciation in real terms. Monetary aggregates increased \nrapidly in 2006 and 2007. Broad money supply rose 38% in 2006 and was at 53.6% by August \n2007, mainly reflecting increases in bank deposits that were almost entirely in dollars. Credit to \nthe private sector,mainly in dollars, grew even faster with 52% growth in 2006 and 62.6% \nduring the first eight months of 2007, but it remains low (only 15% of gross domestic product \n[GDP]). While the rapid growth in monetary aggregates is not currently adding to inflation \npressures  in  the  economy  (i.e.,  money  supply  growing  faster  than  money  demand),  the \nauthorities  are  closely  monitoring  developments  in  monetary  aggregates.  Active  monetary \npolicy is currently limited by the high degree of dollarization, and the lack of indirect monetary \n                                                 \n1  Cofinancing includes $500,000 from the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (funded by the Republic of \nKorea), and $450,000 from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund (funded by the Government of \nLuxembourg). ", "2   \n \ninstruments  (such  as  developed  government  securities).  There  are  considerable  excess \nreserves in the banking system (about 30% of bank deposits are held at the National Bank of \nCambodia [NBC]). The growth in monetary aggregates does pose risks to the small and \nsegmented  banking  system;  the  authorities  are  responding  by  improving  enforcement  of \nprudential regulations (paras. 40 and 41). The current account deficit has narrowed to 7.2% of \nGDP  as  exports  in  goods  and  services  have  grown  more  rapidly  than  imports.  Gross \ninternational reserves increased by $156 million in the first 6 months of 2007 to reach $1.3 \nbillion by June 2007. The ratio of gross international reserves to dollar deposits declined from \n85.7% in 2006 to less than 73.5% in June 2007 indicating that maintaining adequate coverage \nof  rapidly  increasing  dollars  in  the  banking  system  is  challenging.  NBC  is  reliant  on  its \ninternational reserves to provide dollar liquidity to the financial sector.  \n \n4.  Improved Fiscal Management. Fiscal performance continued to improve in 2006 with a \nprimary budget surplus of 2.3% in 2006 and is estimated at about 2% in 2007. The overall \nbudget, which includes capital expenditures (excluding grants), recorded a financing deficit of \n3% of GDP in 2006 which is expected to remain unchanged in 2007. Domestic budget revenues \nincreased significantly over the past 2 years due to improved tax collection. The Government\u2019s \npublic financial management reform program, launched in December 2004, has started to yield \nresults with an increasing proportion of customs and tax revenues collected through the banking \nsystem and a growing share of treasury payments to suppliers made by check instead of cash. \nOver the medium term, primary budget surpluses are expected to continue and the overall \ndeficit will remain about 3% of GDP. Public external debt as a share of GDP continues to \ndecline, falling from 38% in 2004 to 31% in 2006; it remains on a sustainable path.  \n \n5.  Continued Reduction in Poverty. Poverty incidence has declined rapidly from about \n47% in 1994 to 35% in 2004. Poverty is expected to continue to fall in 2007 given the recent \neconomic expansion. Per capita household consumption has risen 32% in real terms since \n2004 (estimated $500 per capita in 2006).  \n \n6.  Strong Financial Sector Growth. Broad money supply remains relatively low (21% of \nnominal GDP), but current growth at 43% indicates increased financial sector deepening. \nPrivate sector credit expanded at the annual rate of 46% in the first half of 2007 and bank \ndeposits mainly in dollars grew by a similar amount. Consequently the loan to deposit ratio has \nbeen rising and is now at 60%. However, the rapid growth in private sector credit fueled by the \nfast expansion in monetary aggregates during the last 2 years may endanger the immature \nfinancial sector through substandard credit appraisal and inadequate portfolio management. \nThe rapid growth in foreign currency deposits is concentrated in a few banks. Credit, which is \nsimilarly concentrated, is almost entirely collateralized against the booming real estate market \nand  appears  to  be  financing  real  estate  and  construction  investment.  While  reported \nsystemwide nonperforming loans remain below 10%, there are concerns about the quality of \nasset classification. The rapid credit expansion reinforces the critical importance of strong \nbanking supervision and enforcement of compliance with prudential regulations with priority \ngiven to assessing asset quality.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n7.  Institutions. Cambodia\u2019s financial system is undergoing a rebuilding process like most \nother institutions following the political instability and institutional destruction of the late 1970s \nand  early  1980s.  Before  1989,  no  formal  financial  intermediation  was  available  and  the ", "      3           \nCambodian financial system was confined to one institution\u2014People\u2019s Bank of Kampuchea, \nwhich had the dual role of issuer of national currency (the riel) and national treasurer to finance \ngovernment operations. The treasury role was subsequently transferred to the Ministry of \nEconomy  and  Finance  (MEF)  in  1990.  This  was  a  period  of  hyperinflation  and  steep \ndevaluation  of  the  riel.  Inflows  of  dollars  following  establishment  of  the  United  Nations \nTransitional Authority in 1991 provided a safer alternative to the riel for cash holdings and \nprotection against loss of purchasing power; the dollar has since gained legal tender status in \nCambodia. In 1996, with the promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the \nNational Bank of Cambodia, NBC was established as the country\u2019s central bank. In 1999, the \nGovernment enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions. \n \n8.  Growth and Development. At the end of August 2007, the formal financial system \ncomprised NBC, 16 commercial banks, 7 specialized financial institutions, and 2 representative \noffices of foreign-based banks; 17 licensed and 26 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs); \nand 6 insurance companies. Cambodia has yet to establish bond or securities markets. The \npredominantly rural nature of the economy, high transaction costs, inability of the real sector to \nput  together  bankable  projects,  and  low  creditor  confidence  have  been  the  main  factors \nresulting in low formal intermediation and outreach within the sector, slow development in \nnonbank financial institutions, and limited range of products and services offered. The financial \ncrisis  in  the  late  1990s,  the  adoption  of  the  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions  Law,  and \nmembership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 1999 and the World Trade \nOrganization in 2003 were among the events that provided a strong impetus for financial sector \nreform. A sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2.  \n \n9.  Financial Intermediation. The financial sector has been growing from a very low base \n(key financial data is in Table 2). The broad money (M2) to GDP ratio was around 21% at the \nend of 2006 compared to 13% in 2001. Credit to the private sector increased from 6.0% of GDP \nin 2001 to 12.2% in 2006, and total bank deposits to GDP was 17.9% in 2006 compared to \n10.4% in 2001. Public confidence in the banking system is increasing as depicted by the entry \nof additional foreign banks and annual average growth of total deposits by 30% and assets by \n27% between 2001 and 2006 (private sector credit increased by 52% in 2006). While growth in \nthe banking system is facilitating economic development, the fast pace of growth requires strong \nsupervision and surveillance to ensure banks are weighing all the risks properly. Lending is \nhighly concentrated with the leading five banks accounting for 67% of total lending at the end of \n2006  and  competition  is  slowly  picking  up  with  some  evidence  of  market  segmentation \nemerging. Foreign banks do not face any legal barriers for entering the country, and by the end \nof 2006 eight commercial banks had majority foreign owners.  \n \n10.  Insurance.  The  Department  of  Financial  Industry  within  MEF  is  responsible  for \nprudential regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, which consists of one state-\nowned and four private nonlife insurance companies, and a reinsurance institution that is 80% \nstate-owned. Public confidence in this subsector is influenced by the fact that the supervisory \nand regulatory framework is still under development and by the negative publicity surrounding \nthe closure of the insolvent insurance company, Indochine, in 2004. The insurance subsector, \nwith a total premium income of only $13 million (0.18% of GDP) in 2006, is still in its early stage \nof development, and the underlying concepts and business transactions peculiar to insurance \nare very new in Cambodia. The main insurance products available locally address liabilities \narising from construction work, commercial motor vehicles, and public transport third party \npolicies. An insurance industry association was established in 2004. \n \n ", "4   \n \n11.  Microfinance. NBC has, since 2003, assumed the role of both licensing authority and \nsupervisory authority for microfinance activities. Overall, the microfinance subsector is limited in \nboth  relative  and  absolute  size  (total  assets  of  around  1%  of  GDP),  and  is  in  most  part \ndependent on external technical and financial assistance from the international aid community. \nAt  the  end  of  2006,  the  total  of  outstanding  loans  of  licensed  and  registered  MFIs  was \nKR374,021.95 million, equivalent to $92.19 million. Voluntary savings of MFIs are very small. \nLicensed MFIs have adopted a wide range of business models, with good corporate governance \nand orderly market development, to deliver their services and products. This was highlighted in \n2006 when Cambodian MFIs won 4 of 20 financial transparency awards presented by the \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor.  \n \nTable 2: Key Financial Data \nIndicators  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nM2/GDP (%)  13.0  15.6  16.3  18.4  18.4  20.5 \nAverage CAR (%)  122.0  155.0  62.0  34.0  32.0  26.0 \nPrivate sector credit/GDP (%)  6.0  6.3  7.2  8.5  9.3  12.2 \nTotal deposits/GDP (%)  10.4  12.7  13.1  15.1  14.6  17.9 \nNPLs/total loans (%)  8.4  14.8  13.9  10.3  7.8  9.8 \nAverage return on assets (%)  0.6  1.1  0.9  1.2  1.8  2.8 \nAverage interest spread (%)  15.0  14.0  13.3  12.9  12.0  11.9 \nTotal assets of five largest banks/     \n    total assets (%)  62.7  70.3  68.6  66.6  63.3  66.3 \nTotal deposits of five largest  \n   banks/total deposits (%)  80.8  83.6  80.9  78.3  71.0  70.0 \nNumber of licensed and   \n   registered MFIs  0.0  30.0  34.0  38.0  39.0  43.0 \nTotal number of MFI borrowers  \n   (\u2018000)  410.0  328.0  265.0  322.0  368.0  471.0 \nTotal amount of MFI loans            \n   ($ million)  35.9  51.3  32.6  40.9  49.2  92.2 \nNumber of insurance firms  1.0  1.0  4.0  3.0  3.0  3.0 \nTotal insurance premium               \n   ($ million)  3.6  5.5  8.8  10.1  10.8  13.0 \nCAR  =  capital  adequacy  ratio,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  M2  =  a  broad  money  supply  measure,  \nMFI = microfinance institution, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia, and Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Sector Challenges   \n12.  Early Stage of Development with Low Investor Confidence. The weaknesses of the \nfinancial sector stem mainly from the fact that commercial development is still in its infancy. \nSince  1999,  ADB  has  helped  to  implement  reforms  to  establish  the  legal  and  regulatory \nfoundation and incorporate strong norms within NBC in terms of how it discharges its prudential \nfunction. The capital base of the banking system has been strengthened but remains highly \nliquid. Given the high liquidity, to remain profitable banks offer short-term loans (longest duration \nof 3 years) at high interest rates. Competition is still very weak and profitable investment \nalternatives are lacking. Financial outreach is low with limited diversification in products and \nservices available to potential customers. The ability of the real sector to maintain and prepare \nreliable financial reports continues to be a challenge. Efforts to develop appropriate accounting \nand reporting standards; strengthen the credit information-sharing system; and modernize the ", "      5           \nmanagement information systems of banks (including NBC), and the payments and settlement \nsystem will boost confidence and financial intermediation in the sector. In particular, early \nstandardization of financial sector architecture and the nationwide sharing of common platform \nand  system  applications  are  crucial  for  expanding  the  system  to  accommodate  growing \ndemand. \n \n13.  Underdeveloped Commercial and Institutional Framework. Like other developing \neconomies, the fundamental weaknesses that stifle financial sector development in Cambodia \nstem mainly from its underdeveloped commercial and institutional framework, low formalized \nenterprise development, and limited human capacity and technical expertise. The court system \nlacks the judicial capacity to enforce contracts and resolve commercial disputes on a consistent \nbasis. This contributes to the lack of public and investor confidence in the sector. Enterprises \nthat have enjoyed many years of operating without any established rule of law prefer to remain \ninformal. The majority of participants in the real sector are reluctant to enter into any form of \nformal financial transactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. Efforts to get the \nNational Assembly to adopt the remaining commercial laws and have the Government launch \nan  online  registry  for  secured  transactions,  establish  dispute  resolution  mechanisms,  and \nenhance  institutional  and  technical  capacity  are  beginning  to  succeed  and  when  fully \nimplemented will help mitigate these issues.  \n \n14.  Shallow  Financial  Sector.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \nrestructuring and reforms since the mid-1990s. For instance, NBC led the relicensing program \nthat brought about the closure of 16 nonviable banks in 2002, raised capital requirements for the \nremaining banks to $13 million equivalent, and set the minimum capital adequacy ratio at 15% \nof risk-weighted assets. Privatization of the only state-owned commercial bank (Foreign Trade \nBank) was completed in 2005. Banks have been free to set their own interest rates since 1995. \nNevertheless, the financial sector is shallow and dominated by banks. Broad money at 21% of \nGDP is relatively low compared to neighboring countries (Figure 1) indicating that Cambodia \nhas  much  work  to  do  to  deepen  its  financial  sector.  The  average  interest  rate  spread  in \nCambodia has been persistently high compared to neighboring countries, although in recent \nyears it declined with increased competition from new banks, in particular with the entry of ANZ \nRoyal. Improvements in financial intermediation in Viet Nam, for example, have helped reduce \ninterest rate margins and deepen its financial sector. Several factors have contributed to higher \ntransaction costs. First, the payments settlement system is underdeveloped lacking an efficient \nand real time electronic settlements system for clearing checks and other transactions. Second, \nuntil recently, banks have not had a mechanism for sharing credit information to help them \nproperly  assess  credit  risk.  Third,  weak  legal  institutions  for  contract  enforcement  and \nbankruptcy increase the risk of lending in Cambodia.  \n \n15.  Bank  Supervision  and  Vulnerability  to  Shocks.  The capacity of NBC for off-site \nsupervision of banks has been upgraded and strengthened. Regulatory standards have been \ngradually  improved  and  relevant  prudential  regulations  added  to  maintain  NBC\u2019s  primary \nobjective of enhancing soundness of the banking system. All banks adopted a uniform chart of \naccounts in 2004 and commenced publishing their annual audited financial reports in 2005. At \nthe end of 2006, NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision Department published its second annual report \nproviding  a  very  detailed  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  banking  system.  These \ndevelopments are evidence that NBC is serious about market transparency and has made \nsignificant progress to establish a sound regulatory and efficient supervisory regime to enhance \nintegrity of the banking system. Although enforcement of prudential regulations is improving, \ncompliance with prudential regulations remains patchy. However, NBC aims to bring banks into \nfull compliance by the end of 2007, in particular, those of systemic importance.  \n ", "6   \n \nFigure 1: Regional Comparison of Financial Sector Development \n140 \nMAL2005 \n120 \nMAL1989 \nTHA2005 \n100 \nP \nD\nG\nof  80 \n% \nVIE2005 \nas  60  THA1989 \n2 \nM\n40 \nVIE1993 \n20  CAM2005 \nLAO2005 \nLAO1992 \nCAM1994 \n0 \n0  20  40  60 80 100 120  140\nDomestic Credit to Private Sector \n% GDP   \n \nCAM=Cambodia, GDP=gross domestic product, LAO=Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, M2= \nbroad money supply measure, MAL=Malaysia, THA=Thailand, VIE=Viet Nam. \nSource: World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. \n \n16.  Rapid Expansion of Lending. The rapid growth in credit over the past 2 years (52% in \n2006 and 46% up to June 2007) is a concern. Along with foreign direct investment inflows, rapid \ncredit expansion is adding to growth in real estate and construction investment that has been \nfuelled by rising property prices. No limits are imposed on exposure to individual sectors of the \neconomy; and while the garment and tourism industries are growing, they are vulnerable to a \nnumber of external factors outside of Cambodia\u2019s control. Credit, which is concentrated in a few \nbanks, is almost entirely collateralized against the booming real estate market. Some banks\u2019 \nassets are increasingly vulnerable to real estate risks. Reported system-wide nonperforming \nloans remain below 10%, but general concern focuses on the quality of asset classification.  \nRecent on-site inspections2 have discovered a number of banks that are not complying with the \nlaws and prudential regulations. The rapid credit expansion reinforces the critical importance of \nstrong banking supervision and enforcement of compliance with prudential regulations with \npriority given to nonconforming banks. \n \n17.  Limited Public Awareness and Weak Coordination of Insurance. Developments in \nthe insurance industry have produced mixed results. Insurance is still a new concept to most \nCambodians and the industry as a whole has not worked to increase public awareness to any \ngreat  extent.  Enforcement  of  the  three  products  available  locally  (commercial  vehicles, \nconstruction  sites,  and  passenger  vehicle  liabilities)  has  been  very  weak  and  coordination \nbetween the ministries assigned to oversee their implementation (Ministry of Interior, Ministry of \nLand Management, Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and Ministry of Tourism) and MEF \nneeds to be improved. The problem of lack of capacity to provide underwriting, actuarial, loss \nadjustors,  fund  management  services,  and  effective  supervision,  remains;  while  current \naccounting practices (statutory or otherwise) are inadequate. A risk-based capital framework is \n                                                 \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2007. Cambodia: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix. Washington, DC. ", "      7           \nneeded  pending  amendments  to  the  existing  insurance  law.  Revisions  to  the  supervision \napproach, and legal framework for insurance businesses are important to put the industry on a \nsustainable path and require the continued support of MEF.    \n \n18.  Microfinance Constrained by Financial Resources. Banking activities in rural areas, \nalthough not fully developed, are improving with MFIs providing most of the formal financial \nservices (mostly credit). With ADB support, NBC has successfully developed the regulatory \nframework for MFIs, and implemented the licensing and registration process. The microfinance \nsubsector is expanding rapidly, with total assets expanding at around 80% in 2006, and the \nassets of a number of individual institutions expanding at 200% annually. Meeting the financial \nresource requirements of this growing subsector from national savings is a challenge, and the \nGovernment is considering various options. While progress has been positive, a large part of \nthe country still does not have access to formal finance. NBC and MEF need to identify the \nareas  requiring  policy  and  regulatory  changes  to  expand  services,  products,  and  savings \nmobilization (directly or indirectly).  \n \n19.  Perceived  Corruption.  Like  most  other  developing  economies  where  financial \nresources are scarce and bureaucracy is weak, opportunities for collusion between vested \ninterest  groups  for  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services  are  greater  than  in  developed \ncountries  with  strong  legal  and  regulatory  regimes.  Cambodia  faces  risks  associated  with \ncorruption and vulnerable institutions. Corruption undermines the rule of law and ethics, distorts \ndecision-making,  and  deters  investment  and  business  confidence.  Many  of  the  causes  of \ncorruption are complex and the Government has been encouraged to strengthen its efforts to \ncombat corruption by groups such as the anticorruption informal aid working group representing \nall  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  operating  in  the  country.  Cambodia's  membership  in \nregional and international organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and \nWorld Trade Organization has increased the momentum of Government implementation of \nanticorruption policies and regulations across all sectors.  \n \n2.  Lessons  \n20.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in  the  financial  sector  since  1999,  beginning  with  the \ndiagnostic assessment of the financial sector, which resulted in the formulation of the Financial \nSector Development Blueprint 2001\u20132010. The blueprint, adopted in August 2001, sets out the \nlong-term vision and development strategy for the sector and is in line with the Government\u2019s \noverall  reform  agenda  of  establishing  a  market-oriented  and  private-sector-led  economy. \nDesigned within the framework of the blueprint, the loan for the first Financial Sector Program \n(FSP I)3 helped to (i) establish a legal and regulatory foundation for banking, insurance, and \ncommercial  development;  (ii)  enhance  public  confidence  and  financial  intermediation  by \nconsolidating the banking system, and strengthening supervision and surveillance of financial \ninstitutions;  (iii)  prepare  the  foundation  for  developing  interbank  and  money  markets;  \n(iv)  develop  key  financial  market  infrastructure  (accounting  and  auditing,  credit  information \nsharing system, secured transactions filing registry, etc.); and (v) establish key institutions with \nappropriate capacity support.  \n \n21.  The ADB country assistance program evaluation4 found that subprogram 1 of FSP I was \ncompleted on time and achieved both the outputs and expected outcomes. The evaluation \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nCluster to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Financial Sector Program. Manila \n4  ADB. 2004. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Cambodia. Manila. \n ", "8   \n \nendorsed the use of the program cluster approach for FSP I as the appropriate modality for \nproviding long-term assistance for sequenced reforms in a situation where the sector had been \nhampered by numerous constraints. Implementation of subprogram 2 was delayed by 1.5 years \nbecause  of  the  general  elections  of  2003  and  the  1  year  delay  in  forming  a  government \nfollowing the elections. Subprogram 3 was also delayed by 3 months. The delays related to the \npassage of draft laws in years when national or commune council elections were held (a \ncommune council election was held in April 2007). Despite the implementation delay, FSP I \ncontributed positively to the outcomes of Cambodia\u2019s financial sector reforms (paras. 8\u201311 and \nTable 2). Key lessons from FSP I and the associated TAs to the sector include the following: \n \n(i)  Long-term  perspective.  The  adoption  of  the  medium-term  blueprint  for  the \nfinancial sector meant that the Government had a set of long-term objectives as \nan anchor to guide and shape medium-term policy design and implementation. \nThe built-in flexibility and changes in the underlying policy environment facilitated \nthe recent update of the blueprint and adoption in February 2007 as the Financial \nSector Development Strategy (FSDS) for 2006\u20132015. The close consultative \nprocess  involving  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners, \nstrengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and  increased  the  potential  for \nfunding agency buy-in. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also provided \nconsistent  long-term  support  to  the  sector  through  a  poverty  reduction  and \ngrowth facility program concluded in 2003 and several TAs. ADB and IMF consult \nclosely to ensure complementarity. The development coordination matrix is in \nAppendix 3.     \n \n(ii)  Flexibility  in  Design.  Financial sector reforms are complex, involving major \nchanges  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  arrangements, \nfinancial  infrastructure,  and  human  capacity,  hence  sufficient  time  must  be \nallocated  to  program  implementation.  Design  flexibility  is  also  a  key \nconsideration. The use of the program cluster approach under FSP I provided the \nopportunity to refine the proposed policy actions for succeeding subprograms to \nreflect the Government\u2019s achievements, changes in the policy environment, and \nlessons from the previous subprogram.  \n \n(iii)  TA  Resources.  Under  FSP  I,  the  Government  adopted  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional measures, many of which were relatively new concepts and therefore \nrequired  extensive  coordination  and  consultation  to  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019 \nunderstanding, acceptance, and likely adoption of the new measures. Substantial \nTA support was necessary to ensure that best practices were incorporated and \nthen consolidated throughout implementation to achieve the intended results.  \n \n(iv)  National and Commune Council Elections. Implementation of subprograms 2 \nand 3 of FSP I was delayed by elections. The commune and national elections \naffected passage of the draft laws targeted by FSP I through the Council of \nMinisters and National Assembly. This is a lesson for program design as the next \nnational general election is scheduled for July 2008.  \n \n(v)  Emerging  Risks.  The  transition  from  a  centrally  controlled  to  a  market-led \neconomy creates new forms of risks. The presence of international banks, the \noffer of more sophisticated services to depositors, and the increase in lending \ndemonstrate  the  increasing  confidence  of  investors  in  Cambodia's  financial \nsystem. However, with these encouraging developments come new risks and ", "      9           \nchallenges, and awareness of potential problems within both the public and the \nfinancial sector must be strengthened and new ways for mitigating risks pursued.  \n \n(vi)  Anticorruption  Initiatives.  Previous  decades  of  conflict  and  isolation  have \nresulted  in  weak  governance  and  perceived  high  corruption.  The  speedy \nimplementation  of  changes  often  increases  institutional  risks  and  with  it  the \nopportunities for corruption. FSP I reforms were designed to minimize the impact \nof corruption, deter corruption, and to spur the Government to act on cases of \nmalfeasance.  \n \n3.  The Government Strategy  \n22.  Cambodia\u2019s  first  Social  and  Economic  Development  Plan  for  1996\u20132000  (SEDP  I) \nmarked the Government\u2019s first systematic approach to economic growth and poverty reduction \nwith the Government closely participating in the development process. The promotion of broad-\nbased sustainable economic growth as a strategy for poverty reduction continued in the second \nSEDP. Robust growth over the past decade and structural reforms have led to a steady decline \nin the overall incidence of poverty from an estimated 47% in 1994 to 35% in 2004. The gains \nhave been widespread, but not uniform, with the incidence of rural poverty remaining high at \naround 39% and income disparity increasing between rural and urban areas. An important \ncontributory factor is that economic growth has been narrowly based on clothing and tourism, \nboth of which are urban focused with weak linkages to the rural economy. \n \n23.  The  Government  prepared  its  5-year  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP) \n2006\u20132010 in the context of a falling, but still high incidence of overall poverty, and a growing \nrural-urban  divide.  Approved  by  the  National  Assembly  in  May  2006,  the  NSDP  aims  to \noperationalize  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  (adopted  in  2004)  and  achieve  the \ninterim (2010) targets. The Rectangular Strategy sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda as a \nseries of four interlocking rectangles with governance at its core. One of the four strategies \nfocuses on the environment required to implement and promote economic growth through \nagriculture,  infrastructure,  private  sector  growth  and  employment,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment. \n \n4.  The ADB Strategy  \n24.  ADB\u2019s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. In line with the \npriorities and strategies identified in the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy (Figure 2), ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program5 focuses on three strategic pillars: (i) broad-based economic \ngrowth  through  investments  in  physical  infrastructure,  development  of  the  financial  sector, \nsupport for greater regional integration, sustainable development of small- and medium-sized \nenterprises,  and  investments  in  agriculture  and  irrigation;  (ii)  inclusive  social  development \nthrough  basic  education,  empowerment  of  vulnerable  groups  such  as  women  and  ethnic \nminorities, control of communicable diseases, provision of rural water supply sanitation facilities, \nand community-based sustainable management and conservation of natural resources in the \nTonle  Sap  basin;  and  (iii)  good  governance,  through  improvements  in  public  financial \nmanagement  to  enhance  the  development  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures  and \ndecentralization initiatives to strengthen local participation in government and improve public \nservice delivery.   \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

", "      11           \n25.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program specifically states that ADB will continue its leading \nrole  in  supporting  financial  sector  development  and  that  ADB\u2019s  future  involvement  in  the \nfinancial sector would depend on the outcome of the Financial Sector Development Blueprint \nupdate. The FSDS 2006\u20132015 (the updated blueprint) states that financial sector development \nis not an end in itself; rather it is one aspect supporting the development and reduction of \npoverty in Cambodia (Figure 3). While much work is needed to achieve this difficult goal, \naccelerating  and  diversifying  growth  is  generally  accepted  as  key  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment must support this objective. Reform and change is essential for growth. At the \nsame time, expanding finance brings risks; hence, the context in which financial development \noccurs must be carefully considered with a focus on prudential risk reduction, transparency, and \nuniform application of rules and regulations. \n \n \nFigure 3: Overview of the Second Financial Sector Program Clusterin relation to the FSDS 2006\u20132015 and\n  Cambodia\u2019s National Economic Development Goals\nFSDS 2006\u20132015\n-  increase competition \n-  maintain soundness \n-  integrate informal and formal sector \n-  increase efficiency \n \nEconomic \ngrowth with \nequitable \nIncreased resource mobilization,  distribution and \nenhanced intermediation and risk  poverty \nreduction \nIntermediaries \nSavers  and Markets  Investors\nImprove confidence  Maintain stability in the  Promote good  Enhance efficiency\nand financial  financial sector  governance  -  Computerize and \nintermediation  -  Update legal and  -  Promote international  integrate key \n-  Improve financial  regulatory framework  initiatives on anti- operating \nservices and upgrade  -  Strengthen bank  money laundering and  functions of NBC  \nthe payments system  supervision capacity  counter financing of  -  Upgrade the \n-  Enhance market  -  Strengthen prudential  terrorism  capacity and skills \nconfidence  supervision and  -  Enhance corporate  of MFI staff \n-  Establish the registry  regulations of MFIs  governance and   \nfor tradable  -  Enhance legal  transparency in the   \ngovernment securities  foundation to support  insurance industry \n-  Promote outreach in  financial and  -  Establish commercial \nthe formal sector  commercial  dispute resolution \n  transactions  mechanism \n  -  Develop the \naccounting and \nauditing profession \nSecond Financial Sector Program Cluster\nFSDS = Financial Sector Development Strategy, MFI = microfinance institution, NBC = National Bank of Cambodia. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "12   \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The expected overall impact of FSP II is a sound and market-based financial system that \nenhances  resource  mobilization  and  supports  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  expected \noutcome is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. Program formulation considered \nlessons from FSP I and past TAs to the sector.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n27.  FSP  I  successfully  used  the  program  cluster  modality  with  two  tranches  under \nsubprograms 1 and 2 and a single tranche under subprogram 3. With ADB\u2019s financial and \ntechnical assistance, Cambodia has achieved substantial progress in developing the financial \nsector over a relatively short time. In recognition that program-based lending is a changing \nprocess,  the  development  community  is  promoting  results-based  approaches  with  growing \nfocus on understanding the political economy and factors that help shape policy reforms and \nimplementation. Interventions are increasingly targeting improved partnerships and increased \ngovernment  ownership  through  the  delegation  of  more  rights  and  obligations  to  recipient \ncountries. These innovations allow governments\u2019 greater control over the details of development \nprogramming  and  policy  implementation;  enhance  ownership  of  the  development  process; \nprovide flexibility in resource use; and in principle, ensure greater predictability of aid funds tied \nto a country\u2019s budget cycle.6  \n \n28.  Subprograms and Tranching. In view of the national election in July 2008 and recent \ndevelopments in the banking system, FSP II will adopt the program cluster approach. The \nprogram cluster supports a policy reform program anchored on the FSDS 2006\u20132015; it was \nprepared by a joint team of Government and ADB representatives. The key features include (i) a \nseries  of  four  single-tranche  subprograms,  with  a  well-defined  medium-term  framework \nspecified  at  the  outset  and  including  key  reform  actions  to  be  completed  prior  to  Board \nconsideration; (ii) triggers7 for subsequent subprograms to ensure continuous dialogue between \nthe Government, ADB, and stakeholders; and (iii) a small number of well-targeted policy actions \ndesigned to achieve high-impact outcomes in priority areas. The four subprograms are to be \nimplemented from September 2006 to 2010. Subprogram 1 has 14 key reform actions that the \nGovernment began implementing in September 2006. All have been completed prior to Board \ncirculation. Disbursement will follow after loan effectiveness.  \n \n29.  Links  between  Subprograms.  Subprograms  1  and  2  are  linked  by  key  actions \n(triggers) that are deemed essential for the success of the medium-term program. Progress with \nimplementation of these key actions will be an indicator of readiness to proceed to the next \nsubprogram. Subprogram 2 covers January\u2013December 2008 and assuming good progress with \nimplementing the associated triggers and the Government\u2019s readiness to implement successive \ntriggers, it is expected to be processed for Board approval and disbursement in December \n2008. Subprogram 3 covers January\u2013December 2009 and will be processed for Board approval \nand disbursement in December 2009 based on the progress achieved in implementing the \nrelated triggers. Subprogram 4 covers January\u2013December 2010 and will be processed for \nBoard  approval  and  disbursement  in  December  2010  based  on  the  progress  achieved  in \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006. Review of ADB Approach to Conditionality in the Context of Program Lending. Manila, Draft. \n7  These are specified prior actions that are deemed to be essential for achieving the expected results of the medium-\nterm program. Compliance with triggers is seen as indicating sufficient progress to move from one single-tranche \noperation to the next in programmatic lending. ", "      13           \nimplementing the related triggers. The time frame for processing subprograms 2, 3, and 4 is \nonly indicative. Policy conditions for subprograms 2, 3, and 4 will be formulated based on \nprogress in implementing the key triggers. Reform measures may be added as necessary within \nthe  medium-term  framework  after  duly  considering  the  Government\u2019s  social  and  economic \nachievements and changes in the macro policy environment. The development policy letter, \npolicy matrix, and medium-term framework are provided in Appendix 4.  \n \n30.  Following  extensive  consultation  between  ADB  and  the  Government  and  related \nstakeholders at workshops and in bilateral discussions, the reforms to develop the banking, \ninsurance,  and  microfinance  subsectors;  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework;  and  support \nfinancial infrastructure including capacity development, were confirmed. These can be grouped \ninto the following broad development objectives: \n \n(i)  Improve confidence and financial intermediation. \n(ii)  Maintain stability in the financial sector. \n(iii)  Promote good governance. \n(iv)  Enhance efficiency in the financial sector. \n \n1.  Improve Confidence and Financial Intermediation \na.  1.1 Improve Financial Services and the Payments, Clearance, and     \nSettlement System \n31.  A payment, clearance, and settlement system is necessary for resource mobilization and \nservice  outreach;  for  development  of  money  and  interbank  markets;  and  to  support \nmacroeconomic policy implementation. Improving system will help restore confidence, enhance \ngrowth in financial intermediation and outreach, and encourage product and service innovation. \nThe vast majority of transactions in Cambodia are conducted in cash rather than by check; cash \ntransactions are estimated to be mainly in dollars. The high degree of dollarization of the \neconomy is understandable given Cambodia\u2019s political history and very high rates of inflation \nduring which the dollar proved to be a safeguard against potential losses in purchasing power. \nCredit cards are accepted at only a few establishments and no more than about 50,000 debit \ncards have been issued to date, equivalent to less than 1% of the adult population. The debit \ncards can be used only in the automated teller machines (ATMs) of the issuing bank. \n \n32.  With  the  current  system,  checks  are  manually  cleared  and  settled  through \nclearinghouses operated by NBC (in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, with no \nelectronic  link  between  them).  Checks  are  presented  each  morning  at  9:30  a.m.,  and \ndishonored  checks  flow  back  through  the  system  at  3:00  p.m.  Settlement  from  clearing \noperations is recorded in the NBC books at each branch office. In view of this current archaic \nsystem, NBC places high priority on upgrading the payment and settlement system because (i) \nthe rapidly growing economy is straining the existing manual system; an upgraded system is \nurgently required to support the larger, more complex financial transactions in the economy; and \n(ii) moving from the cash-based to a check-based treasury accounts system would enhance \npublic financial management capacities throughout government. To successfully implement the \npayments and settlement system upgrade, NBC has identified the need for a full-time resident \nadvisor  to  provide  guidance  and  support  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  modern \npayment and settlement system. Subsequent to NBC\u2019s requirements, TA resources have been \nidentified under FSP II to assist NBC in this area. \n \n ", "14   \n \n33.  The process for modernizing the national payments and settlement system started in \nlate 2004 when NBC established the Payments Policy Unit. With the required technical support, \nthis unit will play an important role in the future evolution of the payment system. In 2005, \nCambodia  enacted  the  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment  Transactions,  which \nprovides a legal basis for negotiable instruments such as checks, bills of exchange, promissory \nnotes, and regulation of payment systems. Among its top priorities, the Payments Policy Unit \nneeds to establish a relationship with all banks operating in Cambodia, to obtain their input on \nunit initiatives. Unit staff has commenced this consultation with banks to garner their support for \nimplementation  of  the  proposed  road  map  (Appendix  5)  to  modernize  the  payments  and \nsettlement system. Under subprogram 1, NBC has signed a memorandum of understanding \nwith each commercial bank endorsing a road map to modernize the payment and settlement \nsystem. \n \n            b.  1.2 Enhance Consumer Access to Credit and Market Confidence \n34.  The orderly development and expansion of the financial market requires knowledgeable \ncustomers as well as knowledgeable suppliers. It also requires customers to be able to make \ninformed decisions on the services they need and what those services are worth. Since 2005, \nall banks have been required to publish their audited financial statements to allow the general \npublic to make informed judgments regarding where to place their deposits and which bank to \ntransact with. Several banks have published these annual audited financial reports on their own \nwebsites, while others provide hard copies that are often out of stock. FSP II will support NBC in \nits efforts to promote bank transparency by requiring all audited financial statements of banks as \nwell as prudential regulations to be published on the NBC website. This will help promote \ntransparent and positive competition that will encourage public confidence, product and service \ninnovation, efficiency, and economies of scale. The recent high credit growth and high growth in \nbroad money supply requires close monitoring. NBC will provide periodic macroeconomic data \nfor ADB to assess the performance of the financial sector during subprogram 1. \n \n35.  To improve the quality of credit underwriting and portfolio management, and boost the \nconfidence  of  the  banking  system,  a  credible  credit  information  system  and  supporting \nregulations are needed. With close cooperation between NBC and the Association of Banks, a \npilot online credit information sharing system (CIS) was established in August 2006 to support \nthe credit appraisal processes of participating banks. The CIS is part of the Government\u2019s initial \nefforts to promote sound credit assessment and risk management within the banking system. \nRules, regulations, procedures, and a governing structure are in place, but implementation has \nnot met expectations. Several banks have not incorporated the need for regular queries to the \nCIS  into  their  internal  credit  appraisal  processes.  Participating  banks  report  that  since \nintroduction of the CIS, they have had difficulty getting borrowers\u2019 consent to upload credit \ninformation  regarding  loans  extended  before  August  2006  (this  is  not  a  problem  for  new \nborrowers since August 2006). Further, the CIS Steering Committee has not enforced its rules \nfor reporting. Several additions have been made to the system to allow \u201cno cases to report\u201d as a \nquick option for participating banks, which can then trigger a more focused follow-up by the CIS \nSteering Committee. Mechanisms to assist the reporting requirements of the CIS Steering \nCommittee to the CIS Board of Directors are being developed. A number of actions are being \ntaken under the Small-and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Program to build steering \ncommittee capacity to work with the system. The Government will continue to strengthen bank \ncompliance  and  intends  to  establish  an  appropriate  minimum  threshold  to  allow  MFIs  to \nparticipate. Support under subprogram 1 is expected to continue familiarizing all stakeholders \nwith the system and help with any important changes to the governing structure of the CIS that ", "      15           \nmay  be  necessary  for  its  effectiveness.  The  Government  intends  to  move  the  CIS  into  a \ncorporation (so that it may function as a credit bureau) with private sector ownership involved.  \n \nc.  1.3 Establish a Registry for Tradable Government Securities \n36.  The Law on Government Securities, enacted in January 2007, provides a framework for \nthe efficient issuance and management of government securities. This in turn is to ensure that \nthe Government\u2019s financing needs and payment obligations are met at the lowest possible cost, \nand will provide key information to financial sector participants through the development of a \nyield curve. NBC has been assigned the role of maintaining the registry function. In preparation \nfor the issuance of government securities and as part of the triggers for subprogram 2, NBC will \nestablish the registry and train the staff on its operation and procedures. \n \nd.  1.4 Promote Outreach in the Formal Sector  \n37.  Cambodia\u2019s  formal  microfinance  industry  has  undergone  a  transition  from  the \ndevelopment model to a fully commercial model, although some funding is still channeled from \naid organizations and their affiliates. In addition, a large number of money changers (who are \nrequired to be registered), money lenders (who are not required to be registered), about 60 \nunrestricted nongovernment organizations, and other participants operate across the country. \nBy  some  estimates,  the  informal  sector  has  a  greater  share  by  value  and  number  of \ntransactions  undertaken  within  the  economy,  (especially  within  the  poor  and  remote  rural \npopulation) than the formal sector, which comprises registered banks and both licensed and \nregistered MFIs. At present, no reliable data is available on the actual size and scale of the \ninformal financial sector.  \n \n38.  An understanding of the size and depth of the MFI subsector outside of the formal \nfinancial sector needs to be established to help determine the needed policy, both macro and \nmicro, and amount of assistance needed to develop the subsector. A survey would be useful to \ngather information on nonlicensed MFIs outside the formal sector and their impact on the \neconomy. It would include data on size, scale, and scope; and cover both products offered and \nlocations  serviced.  Both  NBC  (for  licensing  and  supervision  purposes)  and  MEF  (policy \nformulation) have agreed to jointly undertake this survey as one of the triggers for subprogram 2. \n \n2.  Maintain Stability in the Financial Sector \na.  2.1 Update the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Banks \n39.  Since  the  adoption  of  the  Law  on  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions  in  1999,  a \ncomprehensive review of this law is needed to effectively address the features of a changing \ndomestic market and the reality of increasing international economic integration. The review \nshould take into consideration consumer protection in connection with the use of debit and \ncredit cards, and bank secrecy provisions to support development of the CIS; and procedures \nfor administering distressed and insolvent banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. \nThe revised law is to be submitted to the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly during \nFSP II. NBC will introduce all the appropriate core principles of Basel I (asset grading and \nprovisioning,  large  exposures,  and  treatment  of  related  party  transactions)  to  ensure  that \nportfolio data, including nonperforming loans, are properly reported and appropriate actions \ntaken  in  a  timely  manner.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC  has  issued  (i)  regulations  on  large \n ", "16   \n \nexposures of banks and financial institutions, and (ii) regulations to amend the prakas8 on \nlicensing of commercial and specialized banks. \n \nb.  2.2 Strengthen Supervision Capacity for Banks \n40.  Updating and upgrading skills is a priority area that must be an ongoing feature of \ndevelopment and deepened in line with the deepening of the financial system. As the number of \nfinancial institutions increases, new products and services will need to be developed. New risks \nwill emerge requiring that skills development and training be pursued in tandem with these \ndevelopments. NBC will continue to strengthen and upgrade the capacity of its own supervision \nstaff to be able to effectively manage these developments. At the same time, NBC recognizes \nthat the financial sector is still in its early stage of development and thus will strengthen its \nsurveillance mechanisms. IMF has been providing a resident adviser to help develop the off-site \ncapability of the supervision staff together with an on-site supervision expert to help NBC \nundertake regular on-site examinations of some high-risk banks. IMF has agreed to continue \nthis technical support.  \n \n41.  NBC has identified the need for ADB support for the on-site supervision of the remaining \nbanks. This is very important in view of the rapid increase in the number and size of loans and \nconcern  with  the  quality  of  information  reported  by  banks.  NBC  has  formulated  remedial \nmeasures, broadly anchored on the policy matrix and program policy framework, covering \nstronger sanctions to help it address potential vulnerabilities in the banking system. NBC will \nclosely monitor progress with implementation of the remedial measures and ADB will regularly \nreview progress reports. Under subprogram 1, NBC has (i) assessed and identified capacity \nbuilding needs for banking supervision, and (ii) strengthened surveillance and has undertaken \nprompt  corrective  measures  for banks  that  are  not  conforming  to  the  laws  and  prudential \nregulations. \n \nc.  2.3 Strengthen Prudential Supervision and Regulations for MFIs \n42.  Financial regulation and supervision are essential to protect against financial crisis not \nonly through the protection provided by the regulator but also through incentives and guidance \ngiven  to  financial  institutions  through  regulations  and  surveillance  to  enhance  their  own \noperations. NBC made very good progress in building the regulatory framework for licensing \nand supervising licensed and registered MFIs. A division for prudential supervision of MFIs, \nestablished  within  NBC\u2019s  Banking  Supervision  Department,  has  issued  several  prudential \nregulations in the form of prakas. These regulations aim to promote public confidence, support \nbest practices and transparency, and prevent fraud and illegal activities. Staff of the division has \nhad some training through technical support9 from ADB to undertake off-site and, to a limited \nextent, on-site supervision. Under subprogram 1, NBC has issued regulations to amend the \nprakas on the licensing of microfinance institutions. \n    \nd.  2.4 Enhance Legal Foundation to Support Financial and Commercial \nTransactions \n43.  For finance to develop beyond basic, short-term, and mainly cash-based transactions, a \nrule of law system for commerce and finance must be developed, updated, and implemented. \n                                                 \n8  Khmer name for regulations or instructions issued by the NBC governor or a government minister. \n9  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Financial Sector Program Implementation. \nManila. ", "      17           \nProgress in preparing and enacting a number of components of the legal framework for financial \nand commercial transactions has been significant. This includes the Insurance Law, Accounting \nand  Auditing  Law,  Commercial  Enterprises  Law,  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment \nTransactions  Law,  Commercial  Arbitration  Law,  Secured  Transactions  Law,  Government \nSecurities  Law,  Civil  Procedures  Code,  and  Law  on  Anti-Money  Laundering  and  Counter \nFinancing  of  Terrorism.  Most  of  the  enacted  laws  have  been  implemented  and  training \ncurriculum introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and judges on these \nnew  principles.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  has  undertaken  a  series  of  public \nengagements to create public awareness nationwide. Laws that were recently enacted require \nthe adoption of implementing subdecrees and the Government will develop the subdecree for \nthe  Secured  Transactions  Law;  and  develop  and  adopt  subdecrees  for  the  Commercial \nArbitration Law and Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Law. Under \nsubprogram  1,  MEF  submitted  the  draft  law  on  nongovernment  securities  to  the  National \nAssembly and on 12 September 2007 the National Assembly adopted the law. \n \n44.  The Government has requested ADB support to complete the drafting of a new law on \ncommercial contracts. The new law would supplement the Civil Code provisions with regard to \ncontract law, and the 1988 Decree on Contract and Other Liabilities. The proposed law will help \nincrease reliance on and confidence in the use of written commercial contracts in Cambodia for \na  variety  of  business  transactions.  FSP  II  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  review \nCambodia\u2019s requirements for a detailed set of rules for commercial transactions, review relevant \ninternational models and approaches, and help draft a new harmonized law on commercial \ncontracts for submission to the Council of Ministers and National Assembly. The new law is \nexpected to include general provisions relating to agencies and franchising.  \n \n3.  Promote Good Governance \na.  3.1 Promote International Initiatives on Anti-Money Laundering and \nCounter- Financing of Terrorism \n45.  Work to implement an anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML \nand CFT) regime in Cambodia will support international efforts to deter money laundering and \nfinancing of terrorism activities, and promote standard governance principles. This will help \nrestore market confidence and discipline. A pilot Financial Intelligence Unit was established in \nJune 2005 with six staff under NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision Department to help with the initial \npreparations.  Throughout  2005  and  2006,  NBC  and  AUSTRAC  conducted  joint  training \nworkshops on AML and CFT in general, including procedures to assess suspicious transactions \nreports, the roles of compliance officers at banks and financial institutions, and conducted an \nAML and CFT assessment. Subprogram 1 has supported the Government in its successful \nefforts to adopt the law on AML and CFT. This will be followed by the adoption of subdecrees \nfor establishing the Financial Intelligence Unit and coordinating AML and CFT activities in \nsubsequent subprograms. \n \nb.  3.2 Enhance Corporate Governance and Transparency in the \nInsurance Industry \n46.  Building  consumer  confidence  in  insurance  as  a  service  will  first  require  public \nunderstanding of the business of insurance and the services it can provide. Business must be \nconducted as transparently as possible to protect consumers, and ensure that information \nprovided to the regulator and the general public is accurate. FSP I helped MEF implement the \nInsurance Law, establish the Insurance Supervisory Unit, provide training support for unit staff, \n ", "18   \n \nintroduce the regulatory framework for new insurance products, and promote restructuring of the \nstate-owned insurance firm and involvement of the private sector in the industry. The profile of \nthe industry is still low and market size is very small. Under subprogram 1, MEF has issued \nregulations on (i) premium rates for fire insurance, and on (ii) licensing of general and life \ninsurance companies. \n \n47.  To enhance the credibility of the insurance industry, the goal for all participants is to \nraise their operations to international standards. Companies with international shareholders \nhave introduced these standards to Cambodia. The regulator and the reinsurer are responsible \nfor reinforcing these standards. The Government and the insurance association can contribute \nto development of the insurance industry by increasing public awareness about insurance, and \nthe regulator could take a leadership role by ensuring transparency within the industry, with the \ngeneral public, and with other government ministries. The trigger for subprogram 2 involves \nsupport to MEF in preparing and adopting an appropriate reporting standard for insurance \ncompanies.  \n \nc.  3.3 Establish Commercial Dispute Resolution Mechanism \n48.  To promote good governance and boost public confidence in the financial system, the \nGovernment  enacted  the  Law  on  Commercial  Arbitration  in  2006  and  the  subdecree \nestablishing a national arbitration center is scheduled to be adopted in 2007. The arbitration \ncenter will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the commercial and financial systems, \nand provide the commercial community with a cost-effective process for dispute resolution \nbased on the rule of law. With increased public awareness of the functioning of the arbitration \ncenter, confidence in the financial sector should increase. However, before the center can \ncommence operation, members of the judiciary, legal profession and management personnel \nwill need to be trained. FSP II will support MOC\u2019s efforts to establish a national arbitration center \nwith the development and adoption of the implementing subdecree, as well as appropriate rules \nand procedures for commercial arbitration by the Council of Ministers. \n \nd.  3.4 Strengthen the Accounting Institutions and Member\u2019s \nProfessional Capacity \n49.  For  efficient  financial  intermediation,  financial  market  infrastructure  needs  to  be \ndeveloped,  particularly  accounting  and  auditing  systems,  supporting  legal  framework,  and \nqualified personnel to implement them. Key accounting and auditing initiatives implemented \nunder FSP I include the (i) adoption of a law on corporate accounts, their audit, and the \naccounting profession; (ii) establishment of a national accounting council to set and interpret \nstandards;  (iii)  introduction  of  requirements  that  international  accounting  standards  and \ninternational standard on auditing be applied to all companies incorporated in Cambodia; and (iv) \nestablishment of an association of accountants and auditors (Kampuchea Institute of Certified \nPublic  Accountants  and  Auditors),  its  bylaws,  a  code  of  ethics  that  complies  with  the \nrequirements of the International Federation of Accountants, and establishment of committees \non education and ethics within the association. In 2005 only 10 locally qualified accountants \nwere working in the system. \n \n50.  Subsequent updates of FSP I introduced an initiative to improve accounting and auditing \ncapacity through a Government-funded scholarship scheme to assist at least 70 candidates per \nyear to train toward the qualification needed to become members of the Kampuchea Institute of \nCertified Public Accountants and Auditors. Up to 2005, these scholarships were awarded to \ngovernment civil servants only. A significant number of these students dropped out for various ", "      19           \nreasons, including the difficulty of the course, they did not see the advantage of continuing, or \nthey changed departments and were too busy. With the very poor results and through policy \ndialogue, this was opened to the general public and selection to be based on merit. This \ncommenced in 2006 and the results have greatly improved. Under subprogram 1, MEF has \nissued  regulations  for  the  criteria  that  would  qualify  enterprises  for  external  auditing. \nSubprogram 2 will continue to support this scholarship scheme. \n \n4.  Enhance Efficiency in the Financial Sector \na.  4.1 Computerize and Integrate Key Operating Functions of NBC  \n51.  Central  banks  around  the  world  perform  a  range  of  services  to  assist  the  sound \nfunctioning of the economies in which they operate. The key functions of central banks in most \ndeveloping countries include (i) operating monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability, or \nat  least  a  low  rate  of  inflation;  (ii)  monitoring  the  soundness  of  the  banking  system,  and \nproviding a clearinghouse and settlement accounts for clearing interbank payments; and (iii) \nacting as a banker for the Government and other financial sector institutions. In Cambodia, \nwhere the dollar is now the most widely used currency, NBC cannot fully operate monetary \npolicy in the conventional sense. It requires an efficient, effective, and reliable information \nsystem to help NBC\u2019s Management perform the above core functions.  \n \n52.  NBC\u2019s current information technology system is not well-integrated across the bank, \nresulting in duplication and inefficiency. NBC would gain considerable benefits, in terms of \nability to provide a more efficient service to the banking sector, with the implementation of an \nintegrated  system  that  initially  links  the  accounting  department  to  the  cash  management \nfunctions  in  the  issues  department,  the  customer  account  management  in  the  banking \noperations department, and the foreign exchange transactions in the exchange management \ndepartment. Eventually the system should also link the accounting department to the NBC \nbranches  to  promote  financial  deepening  and  operating  efficiency.  A  wide  area  network \ninfrastructure will be established at NBC to facilitate real-time clearing and settlement operations \nwith head offices of all commercial banks in Phnom Penh. Under subprogram 1, NBC has \nreviewed and adopted the information technology architecture model.  \n \n53.  Subsequent  subprograms  will  support  NBC  to  develop  its  overall  management \ninformation system requirements, restructure its chart of accounts, prepare bidding documents \nfor its enhanced integrated information technology system, procure software and hardware \nthrough a competitive bidding process, install the systems, and train the system and user staff. \nBenefit will also be gained by providing improved application software for other parts of the \nbank\u2014departments that do not need to link to the core banking system in real time, such as \nbanking supervision, personnel, and economic research and statistics. The total estimated cost \nis $4.6 million (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \nb.  4.2 Upgrade the Capacity of MFI Staff \n54.  Finding  adequately  trained  and  skilled  people  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing \nmicrofinance industry continues to be an ongoing challenge. Growth puts pressure on the \ndelivery and customer sides of the business. Capacity building structures are needed within \nMFIs.  The  Center  for  Banking  Studies  will  (in  consultation  with  the  association  of  MFIs) \nundertake a review of its curriculum with the objective of expanding the scope of training to \ninclude all aspects of MFI business and increase management awareness of liquidity risk, \n ", "20   \n \ninterest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and foreign exchange risk. These courses will \ntarget midlevel staff and managers.  \n \nC.  Important Features  \n55.  FSP II has several distinct features. First, the Government has shown strong ownership \nand commitment in formulating a 10-year rolling financial sector strategy to guide reforms in the \nsector. FSP II was formulated within the FSDS 2006\u20132015 framework and draws on ADB\u2019s \nexperience and lessons from implementing FSP I and related TA projects in the sector.  \n \n56.  Second, the Government under FSP II will continue to pursue, as it did under FSP I, \nphased incremental development of markets that deepens the capacity for resource mobilization \nand risk allocation. This is to be carried out in a manner that is relevant to the country\u2019s needs \nand based on realistic standards and expectations. The high level support provided by the \nFinancial  Sector  Steering  Committee  (FSSC),  chaired  by  the  NBC  governor,  will  facilitate \ncoordination and guide program implementation to achieve the expected outcomes. \n \n57.  Third, interventions will be implemented in a systematic manner to ensure that (i) market \ndevelopment parallels institutional and capacity developments, (ii) linkages across subsectors \nare exploited, and (iii) corresponding risks are mitigated. These interventions can continue \nthrough to subprograms 2, 3, and 4; and will be supported by TA funds to build understanding of \nrisks, formulate mitigation measures, and implement key reform activities. \n \n58.  Fourth,  the  FSP  II  cluster  with  four  single-tranche  subprograms  is  an  appropriate \ninstrument  for  maintaining  ADB\u2019s  results-oriented  partnership  with  the  Government  in \ndeveloping the financial sector. FSP II provides a set of policy triggers for subprograms 2, 3, \nand 4 that focus on results and outcomes. Since the Government determines the pace at which \nthe triggers are to be implemented, this approach encourages government ownership of the \nreform program; flexibility in the implementation agenda; and the opportunity for policy dialogue \ninvolving the Government, ADB, and other key stakeholders in the event that economic, social, \nand political circumstances change. The Government\u2019s commitment to FSP II is clear from the \nFSP I results and the development policy letter. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n59.  The program cluster approach involves four back-to-back subprograms for a total that is \nnot to exceed $40,000,000 equivalent. The Government has requested a loan of $10,000,000 \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for subprogram 1. The loan will be disbursed in \na single tranche upon satisfactory compliance with specific conditions indicated in the policy \nmatrix. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Part of the loan \nproceeds will be used to finance the computerization of NBC\u2019s core functions. MEF and NBC \nhave agreed to use the Government\u2019s standard operating procedures for procurement and \nfunds transfer. The loan amounts for the three subsequent subprograms will be determined for a \ncomparable amount and be processed sequentially upon completion of a set of triggers.  \n \n60.  The ADB funds are to support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix. The loan amount was determined by the strength of the policy package, its \ndevelopment impact, the importance of the sector covered, and the development financing \nneeds of the Government, as estimated by MEF (Table 3). The Government\u2019s gross and net \nfinancing needs will be significant if it is to sustain economic growth above 8% over the medium ", "      21           \nterm and reduce poverty from 35%. The Government aims to increase development and social \nspending  during  2007\u20132010,  and  as  a  result  envisages  a  targeted  Government  deficit \n(excluding grants) in the range of 3.0%\u20133.3% of GDP in 2007 and over the next 2 years. \nAccording to MEF budget reports, the total net financing (primarily external) requirements for \n2008\u20132009 are estimated at KR1,886 billion, excluding grants ($460 million equivalent). The \nGovernment\u2019s debt management strategy is to continue with external concessional debt and \ngrant financing of its budget. Over the longer term, the Government envisages a reduction in \nexternal debt as a share of GDP as the economy continues to expand at a rapid pace and in \nanticipation of oil revenues (although these are of uncertain magnitude and timing). Recent debt \nassessments  by  IMF  indicate  that  the  Government\u2019s  debt  stock  and  servicing  costs  are \nsustainable over the medium-term provided macroeconomic performance (high growth and low \ninflation)  continue  and  budget  revenue  growth  remains  on  track.  External  debt  to  GDP  is \nexpected to continue its decline from currently 31% in 2007 to 28% by 2008 primarily due to \neconomic growth. The current macroeconomic and fiscal environment provides ideal conditions \nfor further reforms in the financial sector, among others. The subprogram 1 loan will help close \nthe financing gap for 2008\u20132009 and support the Government\u2019s reforms to the financial sector.  \n \nTable 3: Cambodia\u2019s Projected Financing Requirements for 2007\u20132009 \n \n  Amount \nFinancing Mix  ($ million) \nNet external financing requirement  460a\n   \nProgrammed external borrowing and grants   \nADB\u2019s planned disbursements b 182 \n       of which:   \nFSP II subprogram 1 loan in 2007  10 \nOther development partners  278 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FSP II = Second Financial Sector Program Cluster  \na  Preliminary estimates.  \nb  Proposed disbursements for 2007\u20132009 as outlined in the ADB Country Operations Business Plan (2007\u2013\n2009).  \nSources: Ministry of Economy and Finance, and Asian Development Bank.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n  1.  Program Management  \n61.  NBC will be the Executing Agency, and MEF and MOC the implementing agencies for \nFSP II. The FSSC, established under FSP I, will continue to coordinate program implementation \namong  government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned.  To  ensure  timely  program \nimplementation,  the  FSSC,  comprising  senior  officers  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  other \ngovernment agencies concerned, will meet as required to review progress reports from the \ntechnical working group and consider pending issues. The FSSC will propose concrete actions \nto resolve those issues. A senior NBC officer will be appointed program director to assist NBC, \nMEF, and MOC in coordinating day-to-day program implementation. The program director will \nbe required to submit quarterly progress reports on subprogram implementation, in particular \nprogress on implementing the policy actions adopted for FSP II. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "22   \n \n2.   Period of Implementation  \n62.  The implementation period for subprogram 1 is from September 2006 to December 2007. \nThe Government has completed all actions for the release of the single tranche. \n \n3.   Procurement and Disbursement  \n63.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding a \nnegative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6),  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. All procurement of goods and services produced in, and originating from \nADB member countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in \naccordance with standard public sector procedures in Cambodia and normal private sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans \n(1998),  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  as  the  Borrower.  The \nGovernment will certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to, or exceeds, \nthe amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan in a given period; and (ii) the loan \nproceeds will be utilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed \nbased on the certification provided by the Government, which confirms that the requirements for \nloan have been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify \nthe accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. FSP II will provide for retroactive financing for \nexpenditures incurred by the Government up to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.  \n \n4.   Anticorruption and Fiduciary issues \n64.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Policy on Combating \nMoney Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant ADB guidelines and \nthe loan regulations were specifically brought to the attention and notice of the Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the \nProgram. \n \n65.  An assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter understand the fiduciary risks and determine appropriate arrangements for the fiduciary \narrangements of FSP II. Discussions were held with the Government during formulation of  \nFSP II on the funds flow from NBC to MEF and the contribution of the ongoing public financial \nmanagement10 reform program to the administration of loan proceeds. The 2007 budget for the \nfirst time presented some information on development spending; good progress in strengthening \ndebt management was also noted. Measures were adopted in January 2007 to streamline \ncommitments  and  payment  processes,  and  reduce  outstanding  arrears.  Very  satisfactory \nprogress has been noted in revenue collections with greater use of the banking system to \nstreamline revenue collection and payment processes.

External Advisory Panel Report on the Public Financial Management \nReform Program. Phnom Penh. ", "      23           \naccounts and budget classification has been substantially completed to improve expenditure \ntracking and reporting. As part of efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption, the \nGovernment  continues  to  place  significant  emphasis  on  strengthening  the  overall  public \nfinancial management system, internal systems (including internal audit functions), and the \nfunctions of the National Audit Authority. The ongoing public financial management program, \nwhich started in 2004, supported by 10 development partners11 including ADB, has helped \nlower the fiduciary risk of the system.  \n \n66.  A core component of FSP II focuses on promoting good governance, deterring money \nlaundering  and  financing  of  terrorism  activities,  and  implementing  measures  that  will  help \nreduce corruption in the overall sector (A Good Governance Framework is in Supplementary \nAppendix B). FSP II includes measures to improve the management information system and \nreporting standards within NBC, banks, and MFIs; promote the transparency of information \nreleased by banks and MFIs; improve compliance with and usefulness of the credit information-\nsharing system; support implementation of AML regulations; and deter activities that could \nsupport the financing of terrorism. The increasing use of payment instruments other than cash \nwill help discourage corruption particularly at central, provincial, and district treasuries. These \nreforms will help keep savers and investors informed, empower civil society to monitor the \nweaknesses  in  these  financial  institutions,  and  deter  those  that  are  vulnerable  to  corrupt \nactivities. \n \n5.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n67.  The Government will open an account with NBC to receive the loan proceeds. It will \nmanage, operate, and liquidate the account in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. ADB \nwill retain the right to audit any account and records relating to utilization of the loan proceeds.  \n \n6.   Program Performance Monitoring and Review \n68.  The program director (para. 61) will coordinate and submit quarterly progress reports on \npolicy  and  institutional  reform  implementation  to  the  FSSC  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  be \nsubmitted in such form and in such detail as ADB may request, and include (i) progress made \nand problems encountered during the review period, (ii) steps taken or proposed to remedy \nproblems encountered, and (iii) proposed detailed activities planned for the next review period. \nThe Government will inform ADB of outcomes of policy discussions with IMF, World Bank \ngroup, and bilateral funding agencies that have implications for FSP II implementation. \n \n69.  ADB, in cooperation with NBC, MEF, and MOC will conduct semiannual reviews of \nprogram implementation progress, and assess the impact on the financial and related sectors of \nthe economy. The Government and ADB will continue to engage in active policy dialogue \nthroughout FSP II implementation on issues that may affect financial sector development and \nadditional reforms that may be necessary or desirable for sustainable development of the \nfinancial sector. On completion of FSP II, and not later than 3 months after completion, the \nGovernment will prepare and submit to ADB a program completion report. \n \n                                                 \n11  ADB, Australia, Department for International Development, European Community, French Cooperation, IMF, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, Swedish International Development Agency, United Nations Development \nProgramme, and World Bank. \n ", "24   \n \nV.   FSP II IMPLEMENTATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n70.  In response to the Government\u2019s request, ADB has prepared a TA project to support \nNBC, MEF, and MOC in preparing and implementing key policy reforms under subprogram 1 \nand reform triggers for subprogram 2, as well as to provide the Government with timely policy \nadvice on a demand basis. The objective of the TA is to provide assistance to the Government \nto find practical solutions to address these issues, as well as to deepen the Government\u2019s \nreform  agenda  in  the  financial  sector.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  of  $2,000,000 \nequivalent. Cofinancing includes $750,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, $500,000 from the \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (funded by the Republic of Korea), and $450,000 from \nthe  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Fund  (funded  by  the  Government  of \nLuxembourg).  ADB  will  administer  the  cofinancing.  NBC,  MEF  and  MOC  will  provide  the \nremaining $300,000 equivalent in the form of office space, counterpart staff, and other support \nfacilities. The main activities of the TA will support (i) modernization of the payments, clearance, \nand settlement system (12 person-months); (ii) implementation of the information technology \ncomponent to computerize NBC\u2019s core functions (26.5 person-months); (iii) bank supervision \nand surveillance (4 person-months); (iv) the Financial Intelligence Unit for AML surveillance (3 \nperson-months);  (v) regulations  and  supervision  of  MFIs  (4  person-months);  (vi)  the \nestablishment of the national arbitration center (3 person-months); (vii) training under the Center \nfor Banking Studies (3 person-months); (viii) legal and regulatory development (5.5 person-\nmonths); and TA project management (4 person-months). Two national consultants will be \nrequired: an information technology expert (20 person-months) and a legal expert (4 person-\nmonths).  A  total  of  89  person-months  of  consulting  inputs  are  required  comprising  65 \ninternational and 24 national person-months. Experience in Cambodia has shown that firms, as \nopposed to individual consultants, have been more expensive and have not been successful in \nrecruiting the right mix of consultants, especially when the project requires a diverse set of \nexpertise. Because of the varying nature of expertise, the consultants will be engaged by ADB \non an individual basis to implement TA activities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using the competitive selection \nmethod. The TA purpose, outputs, methodology, implementation arrangements, budget, and \nterms of references are in Appendix 7. NBC will be the Executing Agency, and MEF and MOC \nthe implementing agencies. \n \nVI.   PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.   Benefits \n71.  With a rapidly growing commercial economy that requires a sound financial system to \nsustain the growth rate, the Government needs to develop the financial sector by mobilizing \nfinancial resources, channeling them to productive investments, and managing inherent risks, if \nit  is  to  achieve  long-term  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Asian \nfinancial crisis provided many examples of the devastating impact that financial crises can have \non countries, wiping out several years of growth within a very short time. Thus to promote \neconomic growth, reduce poverty, and help Cambodia avoid financial crises, FSP II will support \nthe Government in its development agenda. \n \n72.  The  policies  supported  by  FSP  II  will  help  reduce  information  asymmetry,  improve \ngovernance, enhance financial stability, and improve efficiency in the financial sector. These \nfactors  will  contribute  to  a  more  conducive  environment  for  continued  financial  market \ndevelopment. FSP II is expected to boost confidence among market participants and, with \nimprovements to the payments, clearance, and settlement system, financial intermediation will ", "      25           \ngrow resulting in a wider offering of products and services in urban and rural areas. A sound, \nmore efficient, and diversified financial sector will support higher investments and productivity in \nthe private sector. Together with broader economic reforms in Cambodia, the reforms in the \nfinancial sector will contribute to higher economic growth. \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n73.  FSP  II  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a  negative  impact  on \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement, \nimpact on indigenous people, and impact on the environment. FSP II is a general intervention \naimed at supporting sustainable economic growth and in that respect is expected to have an \nindirect positive effect on poverty reduction (Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \u2013 \nAppendix 8). \n \nC.    Assumptions and Risks \n74.  FSP II assumes political stability in Cambodia and sustained implementation of sound \nmacroeconomic policies by the Government. Given Cambodia\u2019s encouraging results in the past \ndecade, both these assumptions are valid and defensible. However, implementation of FSP II \ncould face a number of risks; for which mitigation measures have been put in place.  \n \n(i)  Exogenous shocks. The external environment may deteriorate if persistently \nhigh oil prices impede world economic growth and trade, and create unfavorable \nconditions in world financial markets. External shocks would result in slower \ngrowth in Cambodia. To a certain extent, this risk could be mitigated by the \npotential  supply  of  oil  from  Cambodia\u2019s  own  petroleum  deposits.  To  date, \nCambodia continues to show high resilience to oil price shocks. Concerns also \nfocus on the high growth in credit over the past 2 years. Along with foreign direct \ninvestment inflows, rapid credit expansion is adding to growth in real estate \ninvestment because of rising property prices, and is causing the assets of some \nbanks to be increasingly vulnerable to real estate risks. The Government and \nADB will undertake periodic macroeconomic reviews to assess potential risks to \nthe financial sector during FSP II. \n \n(ii)  Unexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia  has  been  enjoying  very  high \npolitical unity and stability for several years. The national election scheduled for \nJuly 2008, while it may not pose a political risk, could cause material risk in terms \nof  delaying  the  law-making  process  during  the  preelection  period  when \ngovernment officials are preoccupied with the upcoming elections. In preparation \nfor such a scenario, FSP II is designed to ensure that most of the legal drafting \nthat closely involves midlevel officials will be completed prior to the general \nelection. Once the Government is formed, hopefully in 2008, draft laws would be \nready for submission to the Council of Ministers for discussion. Sufficient time is \nfactored into the program design.  \n \n(iii)  Poor  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak  governance  and \nincidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor  confidence  and  prevent  the \nattainment  of  expected  sector  outcomes.  The  Government\u2019s  NSDP  views \ncorruption as a threat to sustained growth and development of the country in \ngeneral. Backed by an active development partner community, the Government \nis increasingly taking a tougher stand against corruption. The general consensus \n ", "26   \n \nis that good governance and measures to address corruption are needed for a \nsuccessful  partnership  between  the  Government  and  the  development \ncommunity.  These  were  considered  in  the  design  of  FSP  II  with  continued \ntargeted  improvements  to  the  institutional  governance  structure,  accounting \ndisclosure  standards,  financial  transparency,  complementary  legislation, \nregulatory updates and enforcement, supervision and surveillance, and sector \nefficiency.  \n \n(iv)  Vested  interests  may  slow  reform.  Resistance  to  the  reforms  by  vested \ninterests could delay program implementation or weaken its impact. This risk is \nconsidered  moderate  since  the  Government  has  so  far  shown  immense \ncommitment by pursuing the reform agenda under FSP I and recently adopted \nthe  FSDS  2006\u20132015  (updated  version  of  the  2001\u20132010  blueprint). \nInstitutionalizing governance reforms in NBC, MEF, and MOC is likely to be a \nlong process and the strategic approach of FSP II is to focus on supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s initiatives to (a) promote integrity in the regulation and supervision \nof  banks,  insurance  companies,  and  MFIs;  (b)  promote  transparency  in  the \ndecision-making  process  and  ensure  that  information  is  readily  available  to \nmarket participants who need to make informed decisions; and (c) strengthen the \ncapacity of the various supervisory financial institutions.  \n \n(v)   Weak institutional and human capacity. Risks may be associated with weak \ninstitutional  and  human  capacity,  as  well  as  with  the  implementation  and \nenforcement  of  new  laws  and  regulations.  To  mitigate  those  risks,  training \nprograms have been initiated at various training institutions established during \nFSP I. Subprogram 1 will provide financial support to these institutions to help \nupdate  their  curriculum.  Program  implementation  will  be  supported  by  an \nadvisory TA to reduce the downside risks from weak capacity, especially in the \nimplementation of new concepts. With these design safeguards, the integrated \nbenefits and impact are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nVII.   ASSURANCES \n \n75.  In addition to complying with and implementing the actions specified in the subprogram 1 \npolicy  matrix  and  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the loan agreement: \n \n(i)  The Government will undertake implementation of the trigger actions set out in \nthe  medium-term  policy  framework  that  need  to  be  completed  to  enable \nprocessing of subprogram 2. \n \n(ii)  The Government will (a) carry out the policies and actions in accordance with the \nschedule of policy reforms contained in the medium-term policy framework and \nas described in the development policy letter, and ensure sustainability of the \nreforms beyond the subprogram 1 period; (b) carry out all of its obligations as \nstipulated under the loan agreement in a timely manner; and (c) ensure that the \nagreed actions are taken with respect to each policy achievement.  \n \n(iii)  The Government will keep ADB informed of, and will from time to time exchange \nviews on, the progress made in carrying out subprogram 1. Furthermore, the \nGovernment  will  continue  timely  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on  problems  and ", "      27           \nconstraints, will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  the  implementation  of \nsubprogram 1, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any \nresulting  policy  proposals.

The development path in the 1990s reflected the period of liberal entry of financial \ninstitutions at a time when regulation and supervisory capacity were weak. The era was marked \nby  a  rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  joint  ventures,  locally  incorporated  family-owned  banks, \nbranches  of  foreign  banks,  and  state-owned  financial  institutions,  which  resulted  in  most \nfinancial  institutions  being  poorly  managed  and  almost  half  being  considered  technically \ninsolvent. Supported by an International Monetary Fund poverty reduction and growth facility \nthat was phased out in 2003, the banking system relicensing program (i) introduced a legal \nframework  for  banks  and  financial  institutions;  (ii)  successfully  closed  all  nonviable  banks; \n(iii) relicensed the remaining banks under strengthened National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) \nsupervision requirements; and (iv) initiated restructuring and privatization of the major state-\nowned foreign trade bank. Cambodia\u2019s financial sector remains shallow and fragile with limited \nfinancial intermediation and outreach. \n \n2.  At  present  the  formal  financial  system  comprises  NBC,  16  commercial  banks,  7 \nspecialized  financial  institutions,  and  2  representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks;  17 \nlicensed  and  26  registered  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs);  and  6  insurance  companies. \nCambodia has yet to establish bond or securities markets. The predominantly rural nature of the \neconomy, high transaction costs, inability of the real sector to put together bankable projects, \nand low creditor confidence have been the main factors causing the low formal intermediation \nand outreach within the sector, slow development in nonbank financial institutions, and limited \nrange of products and services being offered. \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s vision for the financial sector is for a sound, market-based system \nthat will enhance resource mobilization, ensure the effective allocation of financial resources, \nand  contribute  to  broad-based  sustainable  economic  growth  as  embodied  in  the  Financial \nSector Development Strategy (FSDS) 2006\u20132015. The FSDS recognizes that for equitable \ngrowth to occur, a diversified, competitive, but prudentially sound financial system would play an \nimportant  role  in  national  development  by  ensuring  efficient  accumulation  and  effective \nallocation of financial resources. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks, hence when \npursuing financial development, a focus on prudential risk management, transparency, and \nuniform application of rules and regulations is needed. \n \n4.  Dominated  by  the  banking  system,  the  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \nrestructuring and reforms since the mid-1990s. In 1996, NBC was established as the central \nbank following promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank \nof Cambodia. In 1999, the Government enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions \nenabling NBC to undertake a relicensing program that brought about the closure of 16 nonviable \nbanks in 2002, raised capital requirements for the remaining banks to $13 million equivalent, \nand  set  the  minimum  capital  adequacy  requirement  at  15%  of  risk-weighted  assets.  The \nFinancial Sector Development Blueprint, formulated and adopted in 2001, provided a clear set \nof  objectives  and  a  sequenced  program  of  reforms  in  the  financial  sector.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  lead  development  partner  in  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to implement the blueprint to improve financial soundness and efficiency, \nrestore confidence, attract a broader base of high quality financial institutions, and broaden the \nsector\u2019s outreach within the blueprint framework. \n \n5.  The  economy  is  largely  cash-based  and  highly  dollarized.  Dollarization  emerged  in \nCambodia because public confidence in the local currency eroded following a series of shocks \nduring the conflict and financial mismanagement prior to 1989. In some instances dollarization \n ", "      Appendix 2  33 \n \nhas assisted development of the financial sector, but in other circumstances, dollarization limits \nthe  tools  the  Government  can  use  in  its  monetary  policies.  With  recent  improvements  in \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  measures  taken  by  the  authorities  to  restore  confidence  in \ninstitutions and in the banking system, public confidence is growing but slowly, and dollarization \nremains high. In the absence of reliable data, the amount of dollars and other foreign currencies \ncirculating in Cambodia cannot be verified. Thai baht and Vietnamese dong banknotes are also \nwidely used in some of the provinces bordering Thailand and Viet Nam. The cash nature of the \neconomy means that even major transactions are settled in cash outside of the banking system \nand paper trails are minimal.  \n \n6.  The private sector is characterized by a high degree of informality, and is dominated by \nthe informal sector. Enterprises that have enjoyed years of operating without any established \nrule of law prefer to remain informal. The tax regime is still very open to negotiation and the \nmajority of participants in the real sector, especially in rural areas, are reluctant to enter into any \nform of formal financial transactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. Private \nenterprises are generally family owned with no separation between management and owners \nwho usually do not maintain proper records, including financial reports that can be considered \nreliable.  \n \n7.  Banking System. No legal barriers are in place for the entry of foreign banks. At the end \nof 2006, eight commercial banks had majority foreign ownership. The commercial banking \nsubsector  now  consists  of  16  commercial  banks,  7  specialized  financial  institutions,  and  \n2 representative offices of foreign-based banks. Despite the increase in the number of banks, \nhigh transaction costs and markups remain but competition is starting to pick up with some \nevidence of market segmentation emerging. With the exception of the Rural Development Bank, \nthe banking system is almost entirely owned by the private sector. Most banks have established \nbranches in other urban centers and are planning to open additional offices in those areas. Only \none bank branch is presently able to provide full banking services for every 120,000 citizens, but \nthis is clearly insufficient to meet the nation\u2019s needs.  \n \n8.  To date most branches are concentrated in large urban centers, but this is expected to \nchange. ACLEDA bank, a former MFI, currently has branches in every province and a total of 79 \nsites provide banking services. Canadia bank has 11 branches outside Phnom Penh, and three \nother banks have 4 branches outside Phnom Penh including ANZ Royal bank with automated \nteller machines at each of its branches. In 2006, bank staff totaled more than 4,600, with one \nbank (ACLEDA) employing 3,028 and other banks employing between 20 and 250. Technical \ncapacity is still weak and most banks provide their own in-house training to complement the \ntraining programs offered by the association of banks. \n \n9.  Commercial banking is relatively small but growing quickly, with the more aggressive \nand progressive banks attaining a growth rate that averaged 52% credit and 42% deposit \ngrowth in 2006. The number of commercial bank loans doubled from December 2002 to total \n164,000 at the end of 2006. If these loans were all to individual borrowers then it would be the \nequivalent  of  providing  loans  to  1.2%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population.  Total  banking  assets \nrepresented about 29% of the estimated gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006. The banking \nsystem is fairly concentrated with about three quarters of deposits held by the six largest \ncommercial banks, which also account for about two thirds of total loans.   \n \n10.  Commercial banks mainly offer simple services to retail and corporate customers in \nurban areas (time and term deposits, savings accounts, basic loans, domestic and cross-border \nwire transfers, foreign exchange, letters of credit, etc.). Specialized banks are not allowed by \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n \n \nlaw to accept deposits and commercial banks had about 285,000 depositors (more than 2% of \nthe total population) at the end of 2006. Most deposit products are short-term in nature and as a \nconsequence  loan  terms  are  also  short  (average  3  years)  with  high  interest  rates.  Banks \ncontinue to rely on physical collateral and personal guarantee as loan security. More advanced \nbanking services are being introduced such as electronic banking and private banking. During \n2006 alone, 69 ATMs were introduced, raising the total from 17 to 86. Several banks have \nindicated that they plan to increase this number. \n \n11.  The  noncash  payment  system  is  very  small  and  of  limited  sophistication.  It  is \npredominantly paper-based and manual. NBC runs the clearinghouse, which operates in both \nriels and dollars. The riel clearinghouse has 15 members (NBC, Ministry of Economy and \nFinance [MEF], and 13 banks) and the dollar clearinghouse has 17 members (NBC and 16 \nbanks).  Average  daily  amounts  that  pass  through  the  clearinghouses  average  about  \n$5.5 million, of which riel clearances represent only around 5%. By volume, about 1,100 checks \nare cleared each day, of which around 95% are drawn in dollars. The first clearance is at  \n9:30 a.m., with a second clearance at 3:00 p.m. to handle returns. Banks bring their balances to \nthe clearinghouse on diskette. Interbank settlement is by check drawn on the banks\u2019 accounts \nwith NBC. The enactment of the negotiable instruments and payment transactions law in late \n2005 and the issuance of key regulations in December 2006 provide the legal framework for \ndeveloping the payments system, introducing new negotiable instruments, and promoting the \ndevelopment of money and interbank markets. \n \n12.  NBC\u2019s  principal  mission  is  to  formulate  and  implement  monetary  policy  aimed  at \nmaintaining price stability and economic development. Its main functions are to (i) act as the \nmonetary authority and conduct monetary policy (NBC has actively intervened in the riel foreign \nexchange market to deliver a stable exchange rate and ensure price stability in riel); (ii) act as \nthe sole issuer of the national currency (as such NBC has increased the number of currency \ndenominations and replaced worn and dirty bank notes); (iii) act as the supervisory authority of \nthe  banking  and  financial  system;  (iv)  oversee  the  payments  system  in  Cambodia;  and  \n(v) manage the international reserves of the country.    \n \n13.  The banking supervision program and standards have greatly improved since 2001 and \nbeen extended to cover all banks, a move made possible with the addition of skilled staff. \nPrudential supervision was enhanced with the adoption of the uniform chart of accounts by all \nbanks in 2004, and the same banks making their annual audited financial statements publicly \navailable since 2005. Several banks have published these annual audited financial statements \non  their  own  websites.  In  2006,  NBC  enhanced  its  regulatory/supervisory  system  by \nimplementing  an  off-site  supervision  system known  as  the  Cambodian  Bank  Reporting  for \nPrompt Corrective Action. The system enables staff to perform a regular analysis of off-site \nreports, and identify risks faced by banks and infringements caused by banks; and then for the \nstaff concerned to recommend immediate actions to NBC management. The development and \nimplementation of the system has been supported by a resident advisor from the International \nMonetary Fund. NBC continues to undertake on-site inspection of each bank once a year. \n \n14.  Banking, along with other financial and commercial subsectors, continues to face high \ntransaction costs attributable to the lack of mechanisms to enforce contracts and absence of \nreliable information. The establishment of the credit information sharing system in 2006 should \nimprove the situation, but some time will be required to build a sufficient database. Dispute \nsettlement remains a major issue and if unresolved will continue to affect the degree of certainty \nassociated with financial and commercial transactions. Financial sector stakeholders would \nundoubtedly welcome the operations of a commercial court and commercial arbitration center to ", "      Appendix 2  35 \n \nprovide a greater degree of certainty. \n \n15.  Microfinance  Subsector.  Microfinance  is  growing  rapidly  with  assets  expanding  at \naround 80% in 2006, with some institutions expanding at 200% per annum. The expansion is \nallowing microfinance to support and grow the economy, especially in its target market of the \npoor and remote rural population. The microfinance subsector now comprises 17 licensed MFIs, \n26 registered rural credit operations, and around 60 nongovernment organizations operating \nunrestricted  across  the  whole  country.  Registration  and  licensing  commenced  in  2002.  A \nnumber have transitioned from aid-focused nongovernment organizations to commercial MFIs; \nand some were set up as commercial, profit-oriented MFIs from the outset. Most MFIs have \nplans to continue rapid expansion with the establishment of additional branches and increased \nlending activities at existing branches. \n \n16.  MFIs currently have around 400,000 clients (about 2.9% of the total population) with \nloans outstanding ranging in size from less than $75 to a maximum of $5,000, but this can go as \nhigh as $10,000. The expansion in net number of loans is currently around 10% per annum. \nVoluntary  savings  of  MFIs  are  very  small.  Licensed  MFIs  have  adopted  a  wide  range  of \nbusiness models with good corporate governance and orderly market development to deliver \ntheir services and products. This was highlighted in 2006 when Cambodian MFIs won 4 of 20 \nfinancial transparency awards presented by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor. The \nestimate in the 1998 Cambodian census was that 1,750,930 families in Cambodia were poor. \nWhile huge progress has been made with poverty reduction; an enormous portion of the poor \nand remote rural population still does not have access to effective financial services.   \n \n17.  MFIs,  while  growing  rapidly,  have  major  challenges  to  expanding  their  services. \nAddressing these issues should assist them to continue to grow in a sound manner. MFIs face \ncompetition from informal operators in their markets. The scale of this competition is anecdotally \nsaid to exceed the size of the formal financial sector but no reliable data is available to support \nthis view. A number of costs and challenges are imposed on the industry such as nonresident \nwithholding tax, lack of a reliable method to track the use of certificates of title for collateral \nbetween institutions, and extremely limited access to domestic funding sources. Growth brings \nits own challenges, such as whether management is able to maintain control over business \nprocesses when the scale of operations begins to outstrip the capabilities of current systems \nand  processes.  Foreign  borrowing  does  bring  growth  and  benefits  in  terms  of  improved \ngovernance and transparency, but at the same time foreign borrowing brings growing foreign \nexchange risk as institutions increase their lending in the riel-based rural areas. \n \n18.  Money Changers. In addition to banks, the Law on Foreign Exchange (1997) allows \nindividuals and legal entities to undertake foreign exchange transactions if they register with \nNBC. They are not allowed to undertake any other financial activity. In December 2006, the \ncountry had 647 registered money changers; 53 in Phnom Penh and 594 in the provinces. \nStatistics on the transactions undertaken by money changers are not available. \n \n19.  Insurance Subsector. The Department of Financial Industry within MEF is responsible \nfor prudential regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, which consists of one state-\nowned and four private nonlife insurance companies, and a reinsurance institution that is 80% \nstate-owned. The insurance industry is young and small. It has gone through a turbulent period \nbut with the introduction of regulations and the enforcement of those regulations, stability and \ngrowth has returned. The regulator requires the capital of each company to be distributed as \nfollows: 10% deposited with NBC, 50% deposited in commercial banks, with the decision on \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \n \n \nhow to invest the 40% balance left to the insurance company concerned. Insurance companies \nhave indicated that they would like these ratios to be changed, and the 40% increased. \n \n20.  Growth has been steady (averaging 11%\u201313% in the last 3 years) from a limited range \nof insurance products; the total gross premiums were $12.5 million at the end of 2006. The \nthree nonlife categories of insurance products (commercial vehicles, construction sites, and \npassenger vehicle liabilities) underwritten in this market are compulsory by regulation. Growth \nhas been steady since 2003 with commercial fire and miscellaneous policies making up 47% of \nthe market, and motor vehicle insurance 19%. Other products sold include hospital and surgical, \npersonal  and  accident,  marine  cargo,  and  travelers  insurance.  The  insurance  companies \noperating in Cambodia are conservatively managed.   \n \n21.  The insurance industry requires a number of specialist skills that are not required in \nother industries. As insurance is a fairly new concept in Cambodia, these specialist skills are not \navailable and need to be acquired (e.g., underwriters, actuaries, loss adjustors, fund managers). \nThe framework for insurance supervision has been developed but material deficiencies in terms \nof capacity for supervision remain.  \n \n22.  Capital  Market.  Cambodia  has  no  bond  and  securities  markets.  The  Law  on \nGovernment Securities was enacted in January 2007 and the non-government securities law \nwas subsequently adopted by the National Assembly in September 2007. The most recent \nshort-term government securities were issued in 2005. The placement of government securities \nis jointly organized by NBC and the commercial banks. The Government has established a \ncapital market unit in MEF and in April 2007 signed a memorandum of understanding with the \nstock exchange of the Republic of Korea for $1.8 million worth of technical assistance to help \nwith the initial training and preparation for the establishment of a securities market in the near \nfuture. \n \n23.  Accounting and Auditing Infrastructure. The continuing growth of the commercial \nsector is creating significant challenges to improve the quality of accounting and auditing, and to \nproduce sufficient numbers of qualified accountants. Cambodia has established a legal and \nregulatory framework for accounting and auditing, but inconsistencies between the various laws \nand regulations remain with some aspects difficult to interpret and weakness in the overall \nframework. Fifteen Cambodian accounting standards and 10 Cambodian accounting standards \nhave been introduced but are not consistent with international standards. A standards advisory \nbody and a local institute of accountants have been established to oversee this. \n \n24.  The accounting profession is in its infancy. The 11 public accounting and auditing firms \nemploy 30 resident qualified accountants, 10 of whom are locally qualified. Currently more than \n12,000 companies are registered and the rate of registration is growing. The public accounting \nfirms have few, if any, local clients. To date more than 1,000 students have enrolled in the local \naccounting qualification course, but approximately 40% of those have either dropped out or \nbeen dismissed. Seventeen students, including those not employed in public accounting, are \nqualified  certified  public  accountants  but  the  vast  majority  of  students  are  experiencing \ndifficulties completing the early stages of the course.  \n \n25.  Legal  Infrastructure.  An  enabling  legal  framework  for  financial  and  commercial \ntransactions could be achieved by continuing support for Cambodia\u2019s process of law reform, \nincluding  the  adoption and  implementation  of core  financial  and commercial  laws  that  are \nharmonized  and  aligned  with  the  legal  system.  The  law  reform  process  in  financial  and \ncommercial areas aims to create an enabling environment for the financial sector and for ", "      Appendix 2  37 \n \neconomic growth in general. The Government has taken important steps to prepare, adopt, and \nimplement  certain  major  laws.  The  second  stage  of  development  is  for  additions  and \nrefinements to be made to the legal framework. \n \n26.  The  process  for  enacting  a  new  law  is  subject  to  several  documented  steps.  In  a \ncommon situation, where an international legal expert has provided assistance and produced a \ndraft document in English, the translation into Khmer would take a minimum of 2\u20133 weeks. Then \nthe  process  of  internal  debate  and  consultation  is  held  within  the  ministry  responsible  for \nintroducing the new law. Following these steps, the procedures pertaining to the passage of the \nlaw through the Council of Ministers and National Assembly are usually lengthy: approval by the \nCouncil of Ministers usually take at least 6 months (but usually longer), and the process for \nsubmission to the National Assembly and the approval process within the assembly itself is \nestimated to take approximately 1 year. As a consequence, delay is always a risk at any given \nstage of the legislative process. \n \n27.  The current court process for the enforcement of collateral is seen as lengthy, uncertain, \nand subject to delays, including the process for appeal. The current situation calls for an urgent \nstrengthening of Cambodia\u2019s dispute resolution system as it is a critical element of the emerging \nfinancial and commercial legal framework. The introduction of commercial arbitration under the \nnew Law on Commercial Arbitration will be a key mechanism to consistently enforce contracts \nand  fairly  resolve  commercial  disputes.  A  new  commercial  court  sponsored  by  the  United \nNations and other bilateral development partners, still in the planning stages, has the potential \nfor improving transparency and finality under clearly set court procedures. \n \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \n \nTable A2: First Financial Sector Program\u2014Results Achieved \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Results Achieved \nGoal     \nDevelop a sound, market- Increased M2/GDP  M2/GDP 2006: 20.8% \nbased financial system to    (2001: 13%) \nsupport resource            \nmobilization and  Increased financial assets/GDP ratio  Total private sector credit/GDP 2006: \nsustainable economic    12.3% (2001: 6.2%) \ngrowth     \n  Increased capital adequacy and bank  Capital adequacy ratio 2006: 26%  \n  profitability  Average ROA 2006: 2.8% \n     \nReduced nonperforming assets  NPL 2006: 9.8% (2001: 8%) \n   \nTightened interest rate spread  Average interest spread 2006: 11.9% \n  (2001: 15%) \n   \nDiversified financial services  Deposit services now include debit and \n  credit cards \n   \nEnhanced rural financial services   Number of MFI borrowers 2006: 471,000 \n  (2001: 410,000) \n   \nDiversified insurance products  The three compulsory nonlife categories \n  now include marine cargo \n   \nIncreased interbank market activities  Not much development as most banks \n  are highly liquid \n   \nEstablished legal basis for capital market  Several commercial laws have been \ndevelopment  enacted and are being implemented  \n \nPurpose      \n1.

The Payments Policy Unit (PPU) will play an important role in the evolution of the \npayment system in Cambodia. The staff are young, with little experience, and need extensive \ntraining and opportunities to gain operational experience to improve their effectiveness. They \nwill need to establish relationships with commercial banks and other authorized users. \n \n2.  The  current  clearing  and  settlement  system  for  checks  is  effective  but  needs \nimprovements.  Improvement  could  be  made  by  having  the  clearing  performed  during \nnonbanking business hours at around 6:00 p.m. each business day. Dishonored checks would \nthen be presented the next business day at 9:00 a.m., with settlement shortly thereafter and \ncompleted no later than 10:00 a.m. This approach would allow banks to provide funds to the \nbeneficiary of a check payment the next business day by 10:00 a.m., 18\u201320 hours sooner than \ncurrently offered. If the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) does not wish to provide the clearing \nat this proposed time, then the banks could provide the clearing at some designated location \nand the return processing could be accommodated by 9:00 a.m. at NBC the next business day. \nTo determine if this is a feasible proposal and the impact on the banking community and their \ncustomer base, PPU should develop a policy paper outlining the many issues of concern; how \nthey might be resolved; and the impact on NBC, the banks, and bank customers.  \n \n3.  If check volumes reach the point where some banks see benefits to automating their \nback  office  processes,  then  the  standardization  of  checks  used  in  Cambodia  could  be \nconsidered, along with the development of bank identification numbers. Section A (paras. 6\u20139) \nindicates the steps involved in making these changes. \n \n4.  In many countries, the evolution of the noncash retail payment system is left to the \nprivate  sector  to  manage  and  implement  with  the  central  bank  providing  only  settlement \nservices. If the private sector in Cambodia prefers that NBC perform this responsibility, then \nperhaps NBC should immediately begin developing an automatic clearinghouse for electronic \npayments following the steps outlined for the development of a real time gross settlement \n(RTGS) system. Otherwise, NBC\u2019s resources should be directed to the development of an \neffective means of handling large value transactions on a gross basis, either through the use of \nSWIFT1 as a communications system or through a fully electronic RTGS system. \n \n5.  Development of either a retail or wholesale payment system will take some time. Section \nB (paras. 10\u201332) outlines steps needed to identify a vendor that could provide an RTGS system. \nThe process would take from 24 to 36 months. A similar process would be required to develop \nan  automatic  clearinghouse  and  may  take  a  similar  amount  of  time,  although  it  could  be \naccomplished with a separate team and move forward concurrently if NBC is unwilling to leave \nthis to the private sector. \n \nA.  Activities \n \n6.  Preparing Position Paper on Changing Hours of the Clearinghouse. This involves \nthe following activities: \n \n(i)  PPU develops initial draft; \n(ii)  consultant reviews initial draft and proposes enhancements (1 week after receipt); \n                                                 \n1  SWIFT refers to Society for Worldwide Inter-bank Financial Telecommunication.

Implementing an RTGS System \n \n10.  Installing an RTGS system in the most effective way and at the least cost requires \nseveral steps. Probably the most important is developing a user requirements document. This \ndocument should describe the detailed needs that all expect the system to meet. It should be \ndeveloped with input from all affected areas of NBC and all the banks to be connected to the \nsystem to ensure the various reports and other needs are achieved. PPU could be given this \nresponsibility, perhaps with some outside help from a consultant. \n \n11.  The user requirements document should be divided into a number of sections, and cover \nin detail: data entry, data validation, data communications, data processing, data storage, data \npresentation,  security,  reliability,  and  planning  for  the  event  of  failure  of  some  system \ncomponent, or of the system in its entirety.  \n \n12.  A vision of what the system would perform and how it would operate, i.e., the system \ndesign, is formulated from the user requirements. The design of an RTGS system should be \nguided by the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems developed by the \nBank  for  International  Settlements.  In  addition,  the  design  should  be  prepared  to  mitigate \npayment system risk, including credit, legal, liquidity, operational, systemic, and other risks \nnormally covered by payment systems.  \n \n13.  The user requirements document provides a broad overview of what is envisioned for \nthe system and its objectives, including the risks that need to be mitigated. Development of a \nuser requirements document should have the support of all the NBC user departments and \nmove forward at a steady pace. Realistically, it would take 4\u20138 months to effectively develop \nand review. Banks should have an understanding of what is happening and the requirements \nshould be shared with them for their views. \n \n1.  Data Entry \n \n14.  The data entry portion of the document outlines the information needed to process the \npayment instruction and to ensure that the receiving bank has sufficient information to post the \namounts to the account of the intended beneficiary. The receiving bank could accomplish this \ntask either manually or electronically. Adopting the SWIFT format may be a good place to start \nand then ensure that these message formats meet the needs of the program participants. The \nformat may need to be customized for local issues that are unique to Cambodia. \n \n15.  In  addition,  the  SWIFT  format  would  identify  the  various  data  elements  needed  to \nconsummate the transaction. Setting up appropriate codes, such as uniform bank identification \ncodes, customer account codes, and proper formatting principles, is important. In addition, \naccess to the terminal to be used for entering the basic data requires some form of control \nprocesses to prevent unauthorized transactions. \n \n2.  Data Validation \n \n16.  Data must be entered accurately. Once the transaction is released for processing and \nforwarded to the receiving bank, little or no time is available to catch an invalid transaction or a \ntransaction  with  erroneous  information.  The  sending  bank  is  totally  liable  and  their  data \nvalidation procedures should therefore be strong to prevent any mishap. One way of ensuring \nthis process is to divide duties so that the person who enters the original data does not validate \nit. The person validating should reenter selected and important data elements, such as the ", "      Appendix 5  61 \nreceiving  bank  identification,  amount,  and  beneficiary  information.  The  computer  can  then \nvalidate the correctness of the information. If accurate, it can be queued for release, or if not \naccurate, returned to the data entry person for correction. One person to enter and correct the \ndata,  the  second  person  to  validate  and  release  the  transaction,  is  the  minimum  staffing \nrequired to enter and send transaction data at any point of entrance. The system should allow \nfor more people to be involved and to divide their duties, but prevent the person that enters data \nfrom validating and releasing the data. \n \n3.  Data Communication or Transmission \n \n17.  Once the data is entered and validated, it is ready for release into the system. Once \nreleased, no human intervention should occur until it reaches the receiving bank unless an \nunanticipated major problem occurs. The transaction should flow through the system until it is \ndelivered to the receiving bank, and possibly even to the beneficiary\u2019s account, depending on \nthe capabilities available at the receiving bank in its delivery of information to customers. Some \nreceiving banks may elect to advise a customer electronically of the receipt of incoming funds. \n \n18.  During the transmission process, the system should provide a high degree of reliability to \nensure that the data is transmitted accurately and the error correction procedures operated \ncorrectly in case part of the information is lost during transmission. This is a vendor issue, but \nmust be understood by the technical staff who will be part of the evaluation team. The vendor \nshould identify the approaches taken to ensure integrity of the data being sent and received, \nand how that integrity is validated. Encryption is very important to ensure that data retains its \nintegrity,  and  is  not  viewed  by  unauthorized  persons  during  the  transmission  process. \nAuthentication processes help to automatically validate the identity of the sending bank for the \nreceiving banks. \n \n4.  Data Processing \n   \n19.  Processing of the data received basically involves debiting the current account of the \nsending bank at NBC and simultaneously crediting the current account of the receiving bank at \nNBC. Most of the time, this will be very simple. However, before the transaction is posted, the \nsystem must confirm the information in the transaction is accurate and valid for use at NBC. \nFurther, some form of authentication is required to confirm that the information came from the \nsending bank that wants its account debited.  \n \n20.  Once NBC is satisfied (based on the criteria programmed into the system), posting may \noccur. If funds in the sending bank's settlement account at NBC are not sufficient, then a \nnumber of options arise. One approach is to outright reject the transaction and return it as \nunprocessed to the sending bank. Another option is to queue the transaction for up to 30 \nminutes or until the sending bank receives sufficient funds from another source. Still another \npossibility  is  to  have  a  predetermined  line  of  credit  with  sufficient  collateral  to  allow  the \ntransaction to move forward. Liquidity management would become easier if NBC decided to \ncentralize  all  operations  and  bank  account  balances  at  head  office  and  not  have  any \ncommercial  bank  account  balances  in  the  NBC  branch  offices.  These  approaches  are \nreasonable and simple to implement. Other more sophisticated approaches are costly. The user \nrequirements document must indicate the various approaches that NBC is willing to support to \nhelp with liquidity management at the sending bank. At the end of the day, any unprocessed \ntransactions would be returned to the sending bank for resubmission at a later time.  \n ", "62  Appendix 5 \n  5.  Data Storage \n \n21.  All transactions are stored in the system for some reasonable time to provide for online \nretrieval  in  the  case  of  disputes  or  other  information  and  historical  statistical  needs.  The \ndatabase should have robust retrieval features and storage sufficient to enable the system to \nretain at least 6 months of transactions. This would also allow for retrieval of information for \nanalysis in determine activities in the payment system on a national basis. Storing data on an \nencrypted  basis  helps  retain  the  integrity  of  the  data  over  longer  periods,  and  prevents \nunauthorized users from understanding the data should they suddenly find that they have \naccess to such files. \n \n6.  Data Presentation \n \n22.  Presenting the transaction to the receiving bank is in some ways the most important part \nof the process. Probably this will be in the SWIFT message format, which is widely used \ninternationally for large value transactions. Also, reports at NBC need to be identified for posting \nto settlement accounts at the end of the day, and for audit trail purposes. Further, end of month \nreports will need to be identified, along with the data that is to be captured, analyzed, and saved \nfor future use. Needs of the various users should be defined as well as how the information \ntechnology infrastructure will be used to forward the various reports to the users. Interfacing to \nstand-alone  systems  for  other  analytical  purposes  will  require  definition  for  forwarding  the \nappropriate data.  \n \n7.  Security and Access Control \n \n23.  Controlling who is to use the system is vitally important. Most systems are able to deny \naccess to unauthorized users through the use of user identification (user-id) and a personal \nidentification number (PIN). The system can also dictate the frequency at which the PIN should \nbe changed for each user, and ensure that the user actually changes the PIN. However, \nmanagement at all locations (NBC and the authorized users) must ensure that the user-id is \ncurrent and that the user-ids of employees who no longer have a need to access the system are \nremoved on a timely basis. \n \n8.  Reliability \n   \n24.  All  critical  components  of  the  system  must  work  throughout  the  processing  day. \nFrequently,  some  redundancy  of  equipment  is  required  to  ensure  high  reliability  for  each \noperating day. Also, spare parts for some components may be needed to ensure users have \naccess and the system is able to provide service under a wide variety of situations. This \nincludes backup electrical power, filters to ensure no electrical power interruption for equipment \nand air conditioning units, alternate data communication lines (e.g., dial backup is a possibility) \nand terminals, and appropriate staff resources. In some cases when an authorized user\u2019s \nterminal  is  malfunctioning,  NBC  should  have  one  or  two  standby  terminals  that  can  be \nconfigured so that a user may come to NBC and enter their daily transactions directly. \n \n9.  Business Continuity \n   \n25.  This area concerns the service that will be provided should a situation arise where the \nmain NBC site is closed because of some catastrophic event that was not foreseen or is \nuncontrollable. While these events are of low probability, they do occur from time to time. \nPerhaps in Cambodia, fire, severe water damage, or an extensive loss of electrical power might ", "      Appendix 5  63 \nbe the most likely events that could disrupt an RTGS system. A remote backup site, generally a \ngood distance from the primary site, is the usual solution to overcome this risk. For operational \npurposes, some staff may have to be relocated, while in other situations useful work can be \naccomplished  at  the  remote  site  to  support  the  need  for  off-site  operating  staff.  Since \ntransactions are recorded on a real-time basis at the backup site throughout the operating day, \nputting a backup site into operation needs to be rapid and the communication infrastructure is \ncritical. \n \n26.  An effective backup site requires appropriately trained staff available at, or able to go \nquickly, under any conditions, to the backup site; and sufficient data communication capability \nso that the system can operate from the backup site with the same degree of effectiveness and \nintegrity as from the primary site. \n \n10.  Tender Development  \n \n27.  Once the user requirements are documented and all the identified issues addressed and \ndocumented, then an RFP can be developed and forwarded to possible vendors. Much basic \ninformation is required for normal acquisition processes. This information will be part of NBC\u2019s \nnormal procurement process (and the requirements of any donor or lending organization that \nmay be involved in helping NBC install such a system). It should also include the criteria to be \nused to evaluate the responses and the weight applied to each criterion. Vendors should be \ngiven from 30 to 60 days to respond to an RFP with the longer times given for the more complex \napproaches. An RTGS system is considered complex, and generally the more time given for \ndeveloping the response the better the reply. Once the tender is released, an evaluation team \nneeds to be organized and understand the criteria for the selection process. Their availability \nwill become critical once the responses are received, usually on the last possible day for receipt, \nto perform the evaluation to help with vendor selection (paras. 28\u201330). Members of the team \nshould  represent  various  NBC  departments  (information  technology,  accounting,  banking \noperations, and PPU at a minimum), and perhaps one or two knowledgeable commercial bank \nrepresentatives with experience in payment systems and bank operations. \n \n11.  Vendor Selection \n \n28.  After the responses are received, the evaluation team needs to review each response \nand analyze the various criteria. Each member of the team should evaluate each response \nindependently and come to a conclusion for each responder based on the criteria. Each criterion \nwill have a separate weight for rating agreed to in advance. Cost should carry a low weight, \nwhile functionality and the ability to meet the user requirements should have one of the highest \nratings. Once this process is complete, one person, perhaps a consultant, will take all the \nevaluations and analyze them to identify the three best vendor solutions requiring detailed \nanalysis (i.e., a short list). The analyst should review the reasons used to justify why the three \nvendors were short-listed for further review.  \n \n29.  These vendors should be invited to make a formal presentation, or visited, to better \nunderstand their approach (one method should be selected, not a mixture of the two.) The entire \nevaluation process needs to be objective, and must be performed in an ethical manner with no \nedge given to one vendor over another. Once the vendors have been reviewed, the evaluation \nteam will provide a recommendation that must be supported by a written evaluation as to why \nthe selected vendor is the best of the three. The recommendation will be forwarded to NBC \nmanagement for approval and for subsequent contract negotiation prior to moving forward with \nother elements of the project.  \n ", "64  Appendix 5 \n30.  This process, from the development of user requirements through the preparation of the \nRFP, to the vendor selection, may take from 12 to more than 18 months depending on the \nabilities of PPU, other NBC departments, consultants, and others involved in the process. \n \n12.  Management Approval \n \n31.  This process may take a short or long time, depending upon the interest of management \nand  the  detail  of  the  presentation.  Management  should  either  accept  or  reject  the \nrecommendation. Management should not be involved in the selection process, nor have direct \ncontact with any of the vendors being considered for the project during the selection process. \n \n13.  Contract Negotiations and Design Evaluation \n \n32.  Once management approval is given to move forward with the selected vendor, time \nmust be taken to ensure that all parties understand the intent of the other. The vendor has a \nproduct to sell and the acquirer wants to assure that the product will meet their needs to the \nfullest extent possible. At this time the acquirer has the most leverage over the vendor to ensure \nthat all elements of the project will be met. In a later mode, the technicians will need to ensure \nthat the system design will meet the user requirements and understand how the vendor will \nachieve those results. During both situations, an opportunity should be provided for both parties \nto cede from the project and for NBC to possibly select another vendor. For this reason, \npotentially unsuccessful vendors should not be notified of the situation until a contract has been \nagreed to by all parties.

Purpose and Outputs \n1.  The primary purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to help the Government improve \nthe capacity of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), which is the Executing Agency, and the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC), which are the \nimplementing agencies, to design and implement key reforms in the financial sector as well as \nto provide the Government with timely policy advice on a demand basis. The objective of the \nadvisory TA is to provide assistance to the Government to find practical solutions to address \nthese issues, as well as to deepen the Government\u2019s reform agenda in the financial sector. The \nreforms, to be implemented under subprogram 1 of the Second Financial Sector Program \nCluster (FSP II), and reform triggers for subprogram 2 are expected to promote confidence, \ngrowth in outreach, good governance, efficiency, and resilience. Implementation of the reforms \nwill  require  technical  inputs  and  targeted  on-the-job  support  to  equip  the  key  government \nagencies (NBC, MEF, MOC) with the required knowledge and skills to ensure that the results of \nthe reforms will be sustained even after FSP II. \n \n2.

Implementation Arrangements \n6.  NBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. NBC, MEF, and MOC will provide the necessary office space, counterpart staff, and \nother  support  services  to  the  consultants;  and  closely  coordinate  with  other  stakeholders \ninvolved in TA implementation.  \n \n7.  The  TA  will  require  a  total  of  89  person-months  of  consulting  inputs  comprising \n65 international and 24 national person-months. Experience in Cambodia has shown that firms, \nas opposed to individual consultants, have been more expensive and have not been successful \nin recruiting the right mix of consultants, especially when the project requires a diverse set of \nexpertise. Because of the varying nature of expertise, the consultants will be engaged by ADB \non an individual basis in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). Detailed terms of reference will be prepared to accompany the \nnoncommittal inquiry. \n \n8.

The inception report will \nbe submitted within 3 weeks of the start of services and will contain a time-bound work plan of \nactivities and deliverables, based on the agreed terms of reference. The interim report will be \nsubmitted half-way through the contract, and the draft final report at least 3 weeks before \ncompletion of the assignment. Tripartite meetings will be held to review the draft final reports. \nThe final report, incorporating comments of the executing and implementing agencies and ADB, \nshould be submitted upon completion of the services. The TA is scheduled to commence by 1 \nMarch 2008 and be completed by 28 February 2010. \n ", "70  Appendix 8   \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nThe Second Financial Sector Program (FSP II) will support the Government\u2019s continued efforts to strengthen the \nfinancial sector via a combination of legal and regulatory reforms, targeted capacity building, improved disclosure \nstandards and financial transparency, and establishment of key financial infrastructure. By promoting the development \nof a sound, market-based financial system to enhance the potential for economic growth and the creation of \nemployment opportunities, FSP II will be pivotal in improving financial intermediation in Cambodia. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help reduce \npoverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic activities, and extending the outreach \nof the formal financial sector to poor and rural areas. An efficient financial system will promote private sector \ndevelopment and foreign direct investment. Beneficiaries are expected to include the poor and near-poor. A robust \nfinancial sector will protect the economy from unfavorable exogenous shocks that are becoming more common in \nincreasingly global financial markets, which have serious implications for the poor. \n \n \nB.
