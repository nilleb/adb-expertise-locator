The four subprograms will be implemented back-to-back with \neach  succeeding  subprogram  to  be  processed  sequentially  upon \ncompletion of the preceding subprogram.  \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth; governance \nSubthemes:  Promoting  economic  efficiency  and  enabling  markets;\nfinancial and economic governance \n \nCategory C \n\n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C. \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n \nSince  1999,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been \nsupporting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  develop  the  financial \nsector including the formulation of the Financial Sector Development \nBlueprint  (2001\u20132010).  The  Government  adopted  the  blueprint  in \nAugust  2001,  and  implementation  began  in  earnest  with  the  first \nFinancial Sector Program (FSP I) and associated TA. As a result of \nFSP  I,  the  Government  was  able  to  establish  the  legal  and \nregulatory  foundations  necessary  for  a  sound  and  market-oriented \nfinancial  sector;  and  take  strong  measures  to  consolidate  banking \nand  introduce  more  stringent  requirements  for  capital  adequacy, \ngovernance, and risk management. Despite the progress, a number \nof  negative  factors  inherited  from  the  turbulent  past  persist.  The \nformal financial system needs to be developed to be more efficient \nand accessible to ordinary citizens.  \n \nWith  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  economy  that  requires  a  sound \nfinancial  system  to  sustain  the  rate  of  growth,  the  Government \nneeds  to  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing  financial \nresources,  channeling \ninvestments,  and \nmanaging the inherent risks, if it is to achieve long-term sustainable \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Asian  financial  crisis \nprovided  many  examples  of  the  devastating  impact  that  financial \ncrises  can  have  on  countries,  wiping  out  several  years  of  growth \nwithin a very short time. Thus to promote economic growth, reduce \n\nto  productive \n\nthem \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \nObjective and Scope \n\nthe \n\nto  strengthen \n\npoverty,  and  help  countries  avoid  financial  crises,  ADB  has  an \nimportant role in supporting financial sector development in its client \ncountries.  \n \nThe  program  loan  cluster  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  continued \nefforts \nfinancial  sector  by  supporting  a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity \nbuilding, improved disclosure standards and financial transparency, \nand establishment of key financial infrastructure. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth;  it  will  help  reduce  poverty  by \nincreasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic \nactivities,  and  extending  the  outreach  of  the  formal  financial  sector \nto  poor  and  rural  areas.  An  efficient  financial  system  will  promote \nprivate  sector  development  and  foreign  direct  investment.  A  robust \nfinancial  sector  will  protect \nfrom  unfavorable \nexogenous shocks that are becoming more common in increasingly \nglobal financial markets.  \n \nFSP II aims to promote the development of a sound, market-based \nfinancial  system  to  support  resource  mobilization  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth.  With  a  growing,  resilient,  and  efficient  financial \nsystem as the expected outcome, FSP II will focus on the following \nactivities: \n(i) \n\nImprove confidence and financial intermediation by upgrading \nthe  payments,  clearance,  and  settlement  system  to  support \ngrowing  financial  services;  enhancing  market  confidence  by \nimproving  public  financial  disclosure  and  establishing  a  credit \ntradable \ninformation  bureau;  establishing  a  registry \ngovernment  securities  to  support  the  interbank  market;  and \nimproving the outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in a \nsustainable manner.  \n\nthe  economy \n\nfor \n\n(ii)  Maintain  stability  in  the  financial  sector  by  revising  and \nupdating  the  law  on  banking  and  financial  institutions,  and \nrelated regulations to support financial activities; strengthening \nregulations  of  banks  and \nprudential  supervision  and \nlegal  and \nthe \nmicrofinance \nregulatory  foundation  by  drafting  a  new  law  on  commercial \ncontracts  that  includes  specific  sections  on  agencies  and \nfranchising. \n\ninstitutions;  and  enhancing \n\n(iii)  Promote  good  governance  by  implementing  international \ninitiatives  on  anti-money  laundering  and  counter-financing  of \nterrorism;  enhancing  corporate  governance  and  transparency \nin  the  insurance  industry;  establishing  commercial  dispute \nresolution  mechanisms;  and  improving  the  capability  and \nincreasing  the  number  of  qualified  national  accountants  and \nauditors. \n\n(iv)  Enhance  efficiency  by  computerizing \n\nthe  management \ninformation  system  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC); \nand upgrading the skills and capacity of microfinance agencies \nstaff.   \n\n\fiii \n\nA  loan  of  $10,000,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s\nSpecial Funds resources for subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-\nyear term including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of \n1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  \n \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  from  September \n2006\u2013December 2007. The loan will be released in a single tranche \nupon  completion  of  specific  tranche  conditions  and  following  loan \neffectiveness. \n \nNBC will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC) the implementing \nagencies. The Financial Sector Steering Committee, established for \nFSP I, comprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, NBC, and other \ngovernment  agencies  concerned,  will  meet  as  required  to  review \nprogress reports from the technical working group, consider pending \nissues,  and  propose  concrete  actions  to  resolve  these  issues.  A \nsenior  NBC  officer  will  be  appointed  as  program  director  to  assist \nNBC,  MEF,  and  MOC \nin  coordinating  day-to-day  program \nimplementation;  and  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB \non program implementation. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in,  and  originating \nfrom ADB member countries will be made with due consideration to \neconomy  and  efficiency, \nin  accordance  with  standard  public \nprocedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to Cambodia as the Borrower.  \n \nProgram  implementation  could  face  a  number  of  risks,  for  which \nmitigation measures have been put in place, as appropriate.  \n(i)  Exogenous  shocks.  The  external  environment  may \ndeteriorate \nimpede  world \nif  persistently  high  oil  prices \neconomic growth and trade, and create unfavorable conditions \nin  world  financial  markets.  External  shocks  would  result  in \nslower growth in Cambodia. To a certain extent, this risk could \nbe mitigated by oil extraction from Cambodia\u2019s own petroleum \ndeposits.  To  date,  Cambodia  continues  to  show  a  high \nresilience to oil price shocks. Concerns also focus on the high \ngrowth in credit over the past 2 years. Along with foreign direct \ninvestment inflows, rapid credit expansion is adding to growth \nin real estate investment because of rising property prices, and \nis  causing  the  assets  of  some  banks  to  be  increasingly \nvulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  Throughout  FSP  II,  the \n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n \n \n\n \nProgram Period and  \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n\f \n\niv \n \n\nGovernment and ADB will undertake periodic macroeconomic \nreviews to assess potential risks to the financial sector. \n\n \n(ii)  Unexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia  has  been \nenjoying very high political unity and stability for several years. \nHowever the national election scheduled for July 2008, while it \nmay not pose a political risk, could cause material risk in terms \nof  delaying  the  law-making  process  during  the  preelection \nperiod.  Subprogram  1  is  designed  to  ensure  that  most  of  the \nlegal  drafting  that  closely  involves  midlevel  officials  will  be \ndone  prior  to  the  general  election.  Once  the  Government  is \nformed,  hopefully  in  2008,  draft  laws  would  be  ready  for \nsubmission to the Council of Ministers for discussion.  \n\n \n(iii)  Weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak \ngovernance  and  incidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor \nconfidence  and  prevent  the  attainment  of  expected  sector \noutcomes. The Government\u2019s National Strategic Development \nPlan  2006\u20132010  views  corruption  as  a  threat  to  sustained \ngrowth and development of the country in general. Backed by \nis \nan  active  development  community, \nincreasingly  taking  a  tougher  stance  against  corruption.  The \ngeneral consensus is that good governance and measures to \naddress  corruption  are  needed  for  a  successful  partnership \nbetween  the  Government  and  the  development  community. \nThis  was  considered  during  design  of  the  program  cluster, \nwhich  will  continue  targeted  improvements  to  the  institutional \ngovernance  structure,  accounting  disclosure  standards, \nfinancial  transparency,  complementary  legislation,  regulatory \nupdates and enforcement, supervision, and surveillance.  \n\nthe  Government \n\n \n(iv)  Vested  interests  may  slow  reform.  Resistance  of  vested \ninterests to the reforms could delay program implementation or \nweaken its impact. This risk is considered moderate since the \nGovernment has shown immense commitment by persistently \npursuing the reform agenda under FSP I and recently adopted \nthe  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy  2006\u20132015  (an \nupdated version of the 2001\u20132010 blueprint). Institutionalizing \ngovernance  reforms  in  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  is  likely  to  be  a \nlong process and the strategic approach of the program cluster \nis  to  focus  on  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives  to \n(a)  promote  integrity  in  the  regulation  and  supervision  of \nbanks,  insurance  companies,  and  microfinance  institutions, \n(b) promote transparency in the decision-making process and \nto  market \nensure \nparticipants,  and  (c)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  various \nsupervisory financial institutions.  \n\nreadily  available \n\ninformation \n\nthat \n\nis \n\n(v)  Weak institutional and human capacity. Some risks may be \nassociated  with  weak  institutional  and  human  capacity.  The \nsame  applies  to  the  implementation  and  enforcement  of  new \n\n\fv \n\nthose  risks, \n\ntraining \nlaws  and  regulations.  To  mitigate \nprograms  have  been  initiated  at  various  training  institutions \nestablished during FSP I. FSP II provides financial support to \nthe  institutions  to  help  update  their  curriculum.  The  attached \nadvisory  TA  will  reduce  the  risks  arising  from  weak  capacity, \nespecially  in  the  implementation  of  new  concepts.  With  these \ndesign  safeguards,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impact  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \n\ninstitutional \n\nimplementing \n\nthe  policy  and \n\n \nADB will provide TA ($1.7 million) to support NBC, MEF, and MOC \nin \nreforms  under \nsubprogram  1  and  reform  triggers  for  subprogram  2,  as  well  as  to \nprovide  the  Government  with  timely  policy  advice  as  needed.  The \nTA\u2019s  objective  is  to  provide  assistance  to  the  Government  to  find \npractical solutions to address these issues, as well as to deepen the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  in  the  financial  sector.  The  TA  is \nestimated to cost a total of $2.0 million equivalent. ADB will provide \n$750,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Cofinancing will include \n$500,000 from the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (funded \nby the Republic of Korea), and $450,000 from the Financial Sector \nDevelopment  Partnership  Fund  (funded  by  the  Government  of \nLuxembourg).  ADB  will  administer  the  co-financing  component. \nNBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  will  provide \nthe  remaining  $300,000 \nequivalent  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other \nsupport  facilities.  The  main  TA  activities  include  support  for  (i) \nmodernization  of  the  payments,  clearance,  and  settlement  system; \n(ii)  implementation  of  the  information  technology  component  to \ncomputerize  NBC\u2019s  core \nfunctions;  (iii) bank  supervision  and \nsurveillance;  (iv)  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  for  anti-money \nlaundering  surveillance; \nregulations  of \nmicrofinance  institutions;  (vi) establishing  a  national  arbitration \ncenter;  (vii)  training  under  the  Center  for  Bank  Studies;  and  (viii) \nlegal and regulatory development. ADB will engage the consultants \non an individual basis to implement the TA activities, in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) using the competitive selection method. \nNBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  the \nimplementing agencies. \n\n(v) supervision  and \n\n \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram cluster to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Financial Sector Program Cluster \n(FSP  II),  comprising  four  subprograms;  and  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  for  subprogram  1.  The  report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  implementing  FSP  II,  and  if  the  Board \napproves the proposed program cluster and loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA  and  administration  of  the  TA  cofinancing. 1  The  program \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\nSustained  High  Economic  Growth.  Cambodia\u2019s  economy  continues  to  expand \n2. \nstrongly.  Growth  has  averaged  over  10%  per  annum  since  2004,  reaching  a  record  13.5% in \n2005. Economic growth is expected to moderate to 9.5% in 2007. Key indicators for 2001\u20132006 \n(Table  1)  show  the  strong  macroeconomic  performance.  Strong  economic  growth  has  been \nlargely  driven  by  continued  high  exports  in  garments,  rising  receipts  from  tourism,  and  a \nbooming construction sector since 2004. Exports expanded by an estimated 27% in 2006 with \ngarment  exports  growing  by  21%  (garment  exports  account  for  74%  of  total  merchandise \nexports).  Economic  growth  is  gradually  becoming  broad-based  with  increasing  growth  in \nservices and the agriculture sector. \n \n\nIndicators \n\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2001 \n\n2004 \n\nReal GDP growth rate (%) \nInflation rate (average annual %) \nBroad money (% of GDP) \nFiscal position (% deficit to GDP) \nCurrent account (% of GDP) \nForeign reserves (months of imports) \nGDP in absolute value ($ million) \nExchange rate (average) \n\n8.0 \n0.3 \n13.0 \n(5.2) \n(8.6) \n3.1 \n3,980 \n3,924 \n\n6.5 \n3.3 \n15.6 \n(6.3) \n(9.4) \n3.4 \n4,273 \n3,917 \n\n \n\n8.5 \n1.2 \n16.3 \n(5.9) \n(10.6) \n3.3 \n4,656 \n3,979 \n\n10.0 \n3.9 \n18.4 \n(4.7) \n(8.2) \n3.0 \n5,315 \n4,019 \n\n2005 \n\n13.5 \n5.8 \n18.4 \n(3.4) \n(9.4) \n2.8 \n6,278 \n4097 \n\n2006 \n\n10.8 \n4.7 \n20.5 \n(1.5) \n(7.2) \n2.8 \n7,265 \n4107 \n\n  ( ) = negative number, GDP = gross domestic product. \n  Sources: National Bank of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, and Ministry of Economy and Finance \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions. Inflation remains relatively low on a regional comparison, \n3. \nanchored by the high degree of dollarization in the economy. At a low of 2.8% in 2006, inflation \nincreased to 3.95% by mid-2007 primarily due to rising food prices. The nominal riel exchange \nrate  remains  stable  with  modest  appreciation  in  real  terms.  Monetary  aggregates  increased \nrapidly in 2006 and 2007. Broad money supply rose 38% in 2006 and was at 53.6% by August \n2007, mainly reflecting increases in bank deposits that were almost entirely in dollars. Credit to \nthe  private  sector,mainly  in  dollars,  grew  even  faster  with  52%  growth  in  2006  and  62.6% \nduring the first eight months of 2007, but it remains low (only 15% of gross domestic product \n[GDP]).  While  the  rapid  growth  in  monetary  aggregates  is  not  currently  adding  to  inflation \npressures  in  the  economy  (i.e.,  money  supply  growing  faster  than  money  demand),  the \nauthorities  are  closely  monitoring  developments  in  monetary  aggregates.  Active  monetary \npolicy is currently limited by the high degree of dollarization, and the lack of indirect monetary \n\n                                                 \n1   Cofinancing  includes  $500,000  from  the  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  (funded  by  the  Republic  of \nKorea),  and  $450,000  from  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Fund  (funded  by  the  Government  of \nLuxembourg). \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\ninstruments  (such  as  developed  government  securities).  There  are  considerable  excess \nreserves in the banking system (about 30% of bank deposits are held at the National Bank of \nCambodia  [NBC]).  The  growth  in  monetary  aggregates  does  pose  risks  to  the  small  and \nsegmented  banking  system;  the  authorities  are  responding  by  improving  enforcement  of \nprudential regulations (paras. 40 and 41). The current account deficit has narrowed to 7.2% of \nGDP  as  exports  in  goods  and  services  have  grown  more  rapidly  than  imports.  Gross \ninternational  reserves  increased  by  $156  million  in  the  first  6  months  of  2007  to  reach  $1.3 \nbillion by June 2007. The ratio of gross international reserves to dollar deposits declined from \n85.7% in 2006 to less than 73.5% in June 2007 indicating that maintaining adequate coverage \nof  rapidly  increasing  dollars  in  the  banking  system  is  challenging.  NBC  is  reliant  on  its \ninternational reserves to provide dollar liquidity to the financial sector.  \n \nImproved Fiscal Management. Fiscal performance continued to improve in 2006 with a \n4. \nprimary  budget  surplus  of  2.3%  in  2006  and  is  estimated  at  about  2%  in  2007.  The  overall \nbudget,  which  includes  capital  expenditures  (excluding  grants),  recorded  a  financing  deficit  of \n3% of GDP in 2006 which is expected to remain unchanged in 2007. Domestic budget revenues \nincreased significantly over the past 2 years due to improved tax collection. The Government\u2019s \npublic financial management reform program, launched in December 2004, has started to yield \nresults with an increasing proportion of customs and tax revenues collected through the banking \nsystem and a growing share of treasury payments to suppliers made by check instead of cash. \nOver  the  medium  term,  primary  budget  surpluses  are  expected  to  continue  and  the  overall \ndeficit  will  remain  about  3%  of  GDP.  Public  external  debt  as  a  share  of  GDP  continues  to \ndecline, falling from 38% in 2004 to 31% in 2006; it remains on a sustainable path.  \n \nContinued  Reduction  in  Poverty.  Poverty incidence has declined rapidly from about \n5. \n47% in 1994 to 35% in 2004. Poverty is expected to continue to fall in 2007 given the recent \neconomic  expansion.  Per  capita  household  consumption  has  risen  32%  in  real  terms  since \n2004 (estimated $500 per capita in 2006).  \n \n6. \nStrong Financial Sector Growth. Broad money supply remains relatively low (21% of \nnominal  GDP),  but  current  growth  at  43%  indicates  increased  financial  sector  deepening. \nPrivate  sector  credit  expanded  at  the  annual  rate  of  46%  in  the  first  half  of  2007  and  bank \ndeposits mainly in dollars grew by a similar amount. Consequently the loan to deposit ratio has \nbeen rising and is now at 60%. However, the rapid growth in private sector credit fueled by the \nfast  expansion  in  monetary  aggregates  during  the  last  2  years  may  endanger  the  immature \nfinancial  sector  through  substandard  credit  appraisal  and  inadequate  portfolio  management. \nThe rapid growth in foreign currency deposits is concentrated in a few banks. Credit, which is \nsimilarly concentrated, is almost entirely collateralized against the booming real estate market \nand  appears  to  be  financing  real  estate  and  construction  investment.  While  reported \nsystemwide  nonperforming  loans  remain  below  10%,  there  are  concerns  about  the  quality  of \nasset  classification.  The  rapid  credit  expansion  reinforces  the  critical  importance  of  strong \nbanking  supervision  and  enforcement  of  compliance  with  prudential  regulations  with  priority \ngiven to assessing asset quality.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\nInstitutions. Cambodia\u2019s financial system is undergoing a rebuilding process like most \n7. \nother institutions following the political instability and institutional destruction of the late 1970s \nand  early  1980s.  Before  1989,  no  formal  financial  intermediation  was  available  and  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3         \n\n \n\nCambodian  financial  system  was  confined  to  one  institution\u2014People\u2019s  Bank  of  Kampuchea, \nwhich had the dual role of issuer of national currency (the riel) and national treasurer to finance \ngovernment  operations.  The  treasury  role  was  subsequently  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy  and  Finance  (MEF)  in  1990.  This  was  a  period  of  hyperinflation  and  steep \ndevaluation  of  the  riel.  Inflows  of  dollars  following  establishment  of  the  United  Nations \nTransitional  Authority  in  1991  provided  a  safer  alternative  to  the  riel  for  cash  holdings  and \nprotection against loss of purchasing power; the dollar has since gained legal tender status in \nCambodia. In 1996, with the promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the \nNational Bank of Cambodia, NBC was established as the country\u2019s central bank. In 1999, the \nGovernment enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions. \n \n8. \nGrowth  and  Development.  At  the  end  of  August  2007,  the  formal  financial  system \ncomprised NBC, 16 commercial banks, 7 specialized financial institutions, and 2 representative \noffices of foreign-based banks; 17 licensed and 26 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs); \nand  6  insurance  companies.  Cambodia  has  yet  to  establish  bond  or  securities  markets.  The \npredominantly rural nature of the economy, high transaction costs, inability of the real sector to \nput  together  bankable  projects,  and  low  creditor  confidence  have  been  the  main  factors \nresulting  in  low  formal  intermediation  and  outreach  within  the  sector,  slow  development  in \nnonbank financial institutions, and limited range of products and services offered. The financial \ncrisis  in  the  late  1990s,  the  adoption  of  the  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions  Law,  and \nmembership  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  in  1999  and  the  World  Trade \nOrganization in 2003 were among the events that provided a strong impetus for financial sector \nreform. A sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nFinancial  Intermediation. The financial sector has been growing from a very low base \n9. \n(key financial data is in Table 2). The broad money (M2) to GDP ratio was around 21% at the \nend of 2006 compared to 13% in 2001. Credit to the private sector increased from 6.0% of GDP \nin  2001  to  12.2%  in  2006,  and  total  bank  deposits  to  GDP  was  17.9%  in  2006  compared  to \n10.4% in 2001. Public confidence in the banking system is increasing as depicted by the entry \nof additional foreign banks and annual average growth of total deposits by 30% and assets by \n27% between 2001 and 2006 (private sector credit increased by 52% in 2006). While growth in \nthe banking system is facilitating economic development, the fast pace of growth requires strong \nsupervision  and  surveillance  to  ensure  banks  are  weighing  all  the  risks  properly.  Lending  is \nhighly concentrated with the leading five banks accounting for 67% of total lending at the end of \n2006  and  competition  is  slowly  picking  up  with  some  evidence  of  market  segmentation \nemerging. Foreign banks do not face any legal barriers for entering the country, and by the end \nof 2006 eight commercial banks had majority foreign owners.  \n \n10. \nInsurance.  The  Department  of  Financial  Industry  within  MEF  is  responsible  for \nprudential  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  insurance  industry,  which  consists  of  one  state-\nowned and four private nonlife insurance companies, and a reinsurance institution that is 80% \nstate-owned.  Public  confidence  in  this  subsector  is  influenced  by  the  fact  that  the  supervisory \nand regulatory framework is still under development and  by the negative publicity surrounding \nthe closure of the insolvent insurance company, Indochine, in 2004. The insurance subsector, \nwith a total premium income of only $13 million (0.18% of GDP) in 2006, is still in its early stage \nof  development,  and  the  underlying  concepts  and  business  transactions  peculiar  to  insurance \nare  very  new  in  Cambodia.  The  main  insurance  products  available  locally  address  liabilities \narising  from  construction  work,  commercial  motor  vehicles,  and  public  transport  third  party \npolicies. An insurance industry association was established in 2004. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\n11.  Microfinance.  NBC  has,  since  2003,  assumed  the  role  of  both  licensing  authority  and \nsupervisory authority for microfinance activities. Overall, the microfinance subsector is limited in \nboth  relative  and  absolute  size  (total  assets  of  around  1%  of  GDP),  and  is  in  most  part \ndependent on external technical and financial assistance from the international aid community. \nAt  the  end  of  2006,  the  total  of  outstanding  loans  of  licensed  and  registered  MFIs  was \nKR374,021.95  million,  equivalent  to  $92.19  million.  Voluntary  savings  of  MFIs  are  very  small. \nLicensed MFIs have adopted a wide range of business models, with good corporate governance \nand orderly market development, to deliver their services and products. This was highlighted in \n2006  when  Cambodian  MFIs  won  4  of  20  financial  transparency  awards  presented  by  the \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor.  \n \n\nIndicators \n\nTable 2: Key Financial Data \n2002 \n2001 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n62.7 \n\n20.5 \n26.0 \n12.2 \n17.9 \n9.8 \n2.8 \n11.9 \n\n18.4 \n32.0 \n9.3 \n14.6 \n7.8 \n1.8 \n12.0 \n\n16.3 \n62.0 \n7.2 \n13.1 \n13.9 \n0.9 \n13.3 \n\n18.4 \n34.0 \n8.5 \n15.1 \n10.3 \n1.2 \n12.9 \n\n15.6 \n155.0 \n6.3 \n12.7 \n14.8 \n1.1 \n14.0 \n\n13.0 \n122.0 \n6.0 \n10.4 \n8.4 \n0.6 \n15.0 \n\nM2/GDP (%) \nAverage CAR (%) \nPrivate sector credit/GDP (%) \nTotal deposits/GDP (%) \nNPLs/total loans (%) \nAverage return on assets (%) \nAverage interest spread (%) \nTotal assets of five largest banks/     \n    total assets (%) \nTotal deposits of five largest  \n   banks/total deposits (%) \nNumber of licensed and   \n   registered MFIs \nTotal number of MFI borrowers  \n   (\u2018000) \nTotal amount of MFI loans            \n   ($ million) \nNumber of insurance firms \nTotal insurance premium               \n5.5 \n   ($ million) \nCAR  =  capital  adequacy  ratio,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  M2  =  a  broad  money  supply  measure,  \nMFI = microfinance institution, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia, and Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n\n35.9 \n1.0 \n\n40.9 \n3.0 \n\n49.2 \n3.0 \n\n92.2 \n3.0 \n\n51.3 \n1.0 \n\n32.6 \n4.0 \n\n410.0 \n\n471.0 \n\n368.0 \n\n265.0 \n\n322.0 \n\n328.0 \n\n38.0 \n\n80.8 \n\n83.6 \n\n80.9 \n\n10.1 \n\n10.8 \n\n13.0 \n\n66.6 \n\n63.3 \n\n78.3 \n\n68.6 \n\n70.3 \n\n71.0 \n\n66.3 \n\n70.0 \n\n34.0 \n\n30.0 \n\n39.0 \n\n43.0 \n\n3.6 \n\n8.8 \n\n0.0 \n\n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nSector Challenges   \n\nEarly Stage of Development with Low Investor Confidence. The weaknesses of the \n12. \nfinancial  sector  stem  mainly  from  the  fact  that  commercial  development  is  still  in  its  infancy. \nSince  1999,  ADB  has  helped  to  implement  reforms  to  establish  the  legal  and  regulatory \nfoundation and incorporate strong norms within NBC in terms of how it discharges its prudential \nfunction.  The  capital  base  of  the  banking  system  has  been  strengthened  but  remains  highly \nliquid. Given the high liquidity, to remain profitable banks offer short-term loans (longest duration \nof  3  years)  at  high  interest  rates.  Competition  is  still  very  weak  and  profitable  investment \nalternatives  are  lacking.  Financial  outreach  is  low  with  limited  diversification  in  products  and \nservices available to potential customers. The ability of the real sector to maintain and prepare \nreliable financial reports continues to be a challenge. Efforts to develop appropriate accounting \nand  reporting  standards;  strengthen  the  credit  information-sharing  system;  and  modernize  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5         \n\n \n\nmanagement information systems of banks (including NBC), and the payments and settlement \nsystem  will  boost  confidence  and  financial  intermediation  in  the  sector.  In  particular,  early \nstandardization of financial sector architecture and the nationwide sharing of common platform \nand  system  applications  are  crucial  for  expanding  the  system  to  accommodate  growing \ndemand. \n \n13. \nUnderdeveloped  Commercial  and  Institutional  Framework.  Like  other  developing \neconomies,  the  fundamental  weaknesses  that  stifle  financial  sector  development  in  Cambodia \nstem  mainly  from  its  underdeveloped  commercial  and  institutional  framework,  low  formalized \nenterprise development, and limited human capacity and technical expertise. The court system \nlacks the judicial capacity to enforce contracts and resolve commercial disputes on a consistent \nbasis.  This  contributes  to  the  lack  of  public  and  investor  confidence  in  the  sector.  Enterprises \nthat have enjoyed many years of operating without any established rule of law prefer to remain \ninformal.  The  majority  of  participants  in  the  real  sector  are  reluctant  to  enter  into  any  form  of \nformal  financial  transactions  for  fear  of  being  exposed  to  the  tax  authorities.  Efforts  to  get  the \nNational  Assembly  to  adopt  the  remaining  commercial  laws  and  have  the  Government  launch \nan  online  registry  for  secured  transactions,  establish  dispute  resolution  mechanisms,  and \nenhance  institutional  and  technical  capacity  are  beginning  to  succeed  and  when  fully \nimplemented will help mitigate these issues.  \n \nShallow  Financial  Sector.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \n14. \nrestructuring and reforms since the mid-1990s. For instance, NBC led the relicensing program \nthat brought about the closure of 16 nonviable banks in 2002, raised capital requirements for the \nremaining banks to $13 million equivalent, and set the minimum capital adequacy ratio at 15% \nof risk-weighted assets. Privatization of the only state-owned commercial bank (Foreign Trade \nBank) was completed in 2005. Banks have been free to set their own interest rates since 1995. \nNevertheless, the financial sector is shallow and dominated by banks. Broad money at 21% of \nGDP  is  relatively  low  compared  to  neighboring  countries  (Figure  1)  indicating  that  Cambodia \nhas  much  work  to  do  to  deepen  its  financial  sector.  The  average  interest  rate  spread  in \nCambodia  has  been  persistently  high  compared  to  neighboring  countries,  although  in  recent \nyears it declined with increased competition from new banks, in particular with the entry of ANZ \nRoyal. Improvements in financial intermediation in Viet Nam, for example, have helped reduce \ninterest rate margins and deepen its financial sector. Several factors have contributed to higher \ntransaction costs. First, the payments settlement system is underdeveloped lacking an efficient \nand real time electronic settlements system for clearing checks and other transactions. Second, \nuntil  recently,  banks  have  not  had  a  mechanism  for  sharing  credit  information  to  help  them \nproperly  assess  credit  risk.  Third,  weak  legal  institutions  for  contract  enforcement  and \nbankruptcy increase the risk of lending in Cambodia.  \n\n \n\n15. \nBank  Supervision  and  Vulnerability  to  Shocks.  The  capacity  of  NBC  for  off-site \nsupervision  of  banks  has  been  upgraded  and  strengthened.  Regulatory  standards  have  been \ngradually  improved  and  relevant  prudential  regulations  added  to  maintain  NBC\u2019s  primary \nobjective of enhancing soundness of the banking system. All banks adopted a uniform chart of \naccounts in 2004 and commenced publishing their annual audited financial reports in 2005. At \nthe  end  of  2006,  NBC\u2019s  Bank  Supervision  Department  published  its  second  annual  report \nproviding  a  very  detailed  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  banking  system.  These \ndevelopments  are  evidence  that  NBC  is  serious  about  market  transparency  and  has  made \nsignificant progress to establish a sound regulatory and efficient supervisory regime to enhance \nintegrity  of  the  banking  system.  Although  enforcement  of  prudential  regulations  is  improving, \ncompliance with prudential regulations remains patchy. However, NBC aims to bring banks into \nfull compliance by the end of 2007, in particular, those of systemic importance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFigure 1: Regional Comparison of Financial Sector Development \n\nMAL2005 \n\nMAL1989 \n\nTHA2005 \n\nVIE2005 \n\nTHA1989 \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n140 \n\n120 \n\n100 \n\n80 \n\n60 \n\n40 \n\n20 \n\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\n\n \n\no\n%\n \ns\na\n\n \n\n2\nM\n\nVIE1993 \n\nCAM2005 \n\nLAO2005 \n\nLAO1992 \nCAM1994 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n20 \n\n40 \n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120 \n\n140\n\nDomestic Credit to Private Sector \n% GDP \n\n \n\n \nCAM=Cambodia,  GDP=gross  domestic  product,  LAO=Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  M2= \nbroad money supply measure, MAL=Malaysia, THA=Thailand, VIE=Viet Nam. \nSource: World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. \n\n \n16. \nRapid Expansion of Lending. The rapid growth in credit over the past 2 years (52% in \n2006 and 46% up to June 2007) is a concern. Along with foreign direct investment inflows, rapid \ncredit  expansion  is  adding  to  growth  in  real  estate  and  construction  investment  that  has  been \nfuelled by rising property prices. No limits are imposed on exposure to individual sectors of the \neconomy;  and  while  the  garment  and  tourism  industries  are  growing,  they  are  vulnerable  to  a \nnumber of external factors outside of Cambodia\u2019s control. Credit, which is concentrated in a few \nbanks,  is  almost  entirely  collateralized  against  the  booming  real  estate  market.  Some  banks\u2019 \nassets  are  increasingly  vulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  Reported  system-wide  nonperforming \nloans  remain  below  10%,  but  general  concern  focuses  on  the  quality  of  asset  classification.  \nRecent on-site inspections2 have discovered a number of banks that are not complying with the \nlaws and prudential regulations. The rapid credit expansion reinforces the critical importance of \nstrong  banking  supervision  and  enforcement  of  compliance  with  prudential  regulations  with \npriority given to nonconforming banks. \n \n17. \nLimited  Public  Awareness  and  Weak  Coordination  of  Insurance.  Developments  in \nthe  insurance  industry  have  produced  mixed  results.  Insurance  is  still  a  new  concept  to  most \nCambodians and the industry as a whole has not worked to increase public awareness to any \ngreat  extent.  Enforcement  of  the  three  products  available  locally  (commercial  vehicles, \nconstruction  sites,  and  passenger  vehicle  liabilities)  has  been  very  weak  and  coordination \nbetween the ministries assigned to oversee their implementation (Ministry of Interior, Ministry of \nLand Management, Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and Ministry of Tourism) and MEF \nneeds  to  be  improved.  The  problem  of  lack  of  capacity  to  provide  underwriting,  actuarial,  loss \nadjustors,  fund  management  services,  and  effective  supervision,  remains;  while  current \naccounting practices (statutory or otherwise) are inadequate. A risk-based capital framework is \n\n                                                 \n2   International Monetary Fund. 2007. Cambodia: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix. Washington, DC. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nneeded  pending  amendments  to  the  existing  insurance  law.  Revisions  to  the  supervision \napproach, and legal framework for insurance businesses are important to put the industry on a \nsustainable path and require the continued support of MEF.    \n \n18.  Microfinance  Constrained  by  Financial  Resources. Banking activities in rural areas, \nalthough  not  fully  developed,  are  improving  with  MFIs  providing  most  of  the  formal  financial \nservices  (mostly  credit).  With  ADB  support,  NBC  has  successfully  developed  the  regulatory \nframework for MFIs, and implemented the licensing and registration process. The microfinance \nsubsector  is  expanding  rapidly,  with  total  assets  expanding  at  around  80%  in  2006,  and  the \nassets of a number of individual institutions expanding at 200% annually. Meeting the financial \nresource requirements of this growing subsector from national savings is a challenge, and the \nGovernment  is  considering  various  options.  While  progress  has  been  positive,  a  large  part  of \nthe  country  still  does  not  have  access  to  formal  finance.  NBC  and  MEF  need  to  identify  the \nareas  requiring  policy  and  regulatory  changes  to  expand  services,  products,  and  savings \nmobilization (directly or indirectly).  \n \nfinancial \n19. \nresources  are  scarce  and  bureaucracy  is  weak,  opportunities  for  collusion  between  vested \ninterest  groups  for  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services  are  greater  than  in  developed \ncountries  with  strong  legal  and  regulatory  regimes.  Cambodia  faces  risks  associated  with \ncorruption and vulnerable institutions. Corruption undermines the rule of law and ethics, distorts \ndecision-making,  and  deters  investment  and  business  confidence.  Many  of  the  causes  of \ncorruption  are  complex  and  the  Government  has  been  encouraged  to  strengthen  its  efforts  to \ncombat corruption by groups such as the anticorruption informal aid working group representing \nall  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  operating  in  the  country.  Cambodia's  membership  in \nregional and international organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and \nWorld  Trade  Organization  has  increased  the  momentum  of  Government  implementation  of \nanticorruption policies and regulations across all sectors.  \n \n\nPerceived  Corruption.  Like  most  other  developing  economies  where \n\n2. \n\nLessons  \n\n20. \nADB  has  supported  reforms  in  the  financial  sector  since  1999,  beginning  with  the \ndiagnostic assessment of the financial sector, which resulted in the formulation of the Financial \nSector Development Blueprint 2001\u20132010. The blueprint, adopted in August 2001, sets out the \nlong-term  vision  and  development  strategy  for  the  sector  and  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \noverall  reform  agenda  of  establishing  a  market-oriented  and  private-sector-led  economy. \nDesigned within the framework of the blueprint, the loan for the first Financial Sector Program \n(FSP  I)3  helped  to  (i)  establish  a  legal  and  regulatory  foundation  for  banking,  insurance,  and \ncommercial  development;  (ii)  enhance  public  confidence  and  financial  intermediation  by \nconsolidating  the  banking  system,  and  strengthening  supervision  and  surveillance  of  financial \ninstitutions;  (iii)  prepare  the  foundation  for  developing  interbank  and  money  markets;  \n(iv)  develop  key  financial  market  infrastructure  (accounting  and  auditing,  credit  information \nsharing system, secured transactions filing registry, etc.); and (v) establish key institutions with \nappropriate capacity support.  \n \nThe ADB country assistance program evaluation4 found that subprogram 1 of FSP I was \n21. \ncompleted  on  time  and  achieved  both  the  outputs  and  expected  outcomes.

Implementation of subprogram 2 was delayed by 1.5 years \nbecause  of  the  general  elections  of  2003  and  the  1  year  delay  in  forming  a  government \nfollowing the elections. Subprogram 3 was also delayed by 3 months. The delays related to the \npassage  of  draft  laws  in  years  when  national  or  commune  council  elections  were  held  (a \ncommune  council  election  was  held  in  April  2007).  Despite  the  implementation  delay,  FSP  I \ncontributed positively to the outcomes of Cambodia\u2019s financial sector reforms (paras. 8\u201311 and \nTable 2). Key lessons from FSP I and the associated TAs to the sector include the following: \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nLong-term  perspective.  The  adoption  of  the  medium-term  blueprint  for  the \nfinancial sector meant that the Government had a set of long-term objectives as \nan  anchor  to  guide  and  shape  medium-term  policy  design  and  implementation. \nThe built-in flexibility and changes in the underlying policy environment facilitated \nthe recent update of the blueprint and adoption in February 2007 as the Financial \nSector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS)  for  2006\u20132015.  The  close  consultative \nprocess  involving  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners, \nstrengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and  increased  the  potential  for \nfunding agency buy-in. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also provided \nconsistent  long-term  support  to  the  sector  through  a  poverty  reduction  and \ngrowth facility program concluded in 2003 and several TAs. ADB and IMF consult \nclosely  to  ensure  complementarity.  The  development  coordination  matrix  is  in \nAppendix 3.     \n\nFlexibility  in  Design.  Financial  sector  reforms  are  complex,  involving  major \nchanges  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  arrangements, \nfinancial  infrastructure,  and  human  capacity,  hence  sufficient  time  must  be \nallocated \nis  also  a  key \nconsideration. The use of the program cluster approach under FSP I provided the \nopportunity to refine the proposed policy actions for succeeding subprograms to \nreflect the Government\u2019s achievements, changes in the policy environment, and \nlessons from the previous subprogram.  \n\nimplementation.

Under  FSP  I,  the  Government  adopted  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional measures, many of which were relatively new concepts and therefore \nrequired  extensive  coordination  and  consultation  to  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019 \nunderstanding, acceptance, and likely adoption of the new measures. Substantial \nTA  support  was  necessary  to  ensure  that  best practices  were  incorporated  and \nthen consolidated throughout implementation to achieve the intended results.  \n\nNational  and  Commune  Council  Elections. Implementation of subprograms 2 \nand  3  of  FSP  I  was  delayed  by  elections.  The commune  and  national elections \naffected  passage  of  the  draft  laws  targeted  by  FSP  I  through  the  Council  of \nMinisters and National Assembly. This is a lesson for program design as the next \nnational general election is scheduled for July 2008.  \n\nEmerging  Risks.  The  transition  from  a  centrally  controlled  to  a  market-led \neconomy  creates  new  forms  of  risks.  The  presence  of  international  banks,  the \noffer  of  more  sophisticated  services  to  depositors,  and  the  increase  in  lending \ndemonstrate  the  increasing  confidence  of  investors  in  Cambodia's  financial \nsystem.  However,  with  these  encouraging  developments  come  new  risks  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nchallenges, and awareness of potential problems within both the public and the \nfinancial sector must be strengthened and new ways for mitigating risks pursued.  \n\nAnticorruption  Initiatives.  Previous  decades  of  conflict  and  isolation  have \nresulted  in  weak  governance  and  perceived  high  corruption.  The  speedy \nimplementation  of  changes  often  increases  institutional  risks  and  with  it  the \nopportunities for corruption. FSP I reforms were designed to minimize the impact \nof  corruption,  deter  corruption,  and  to  spur  the  Government  to  act  on  cases  of \nmalfeasance.  \n\nThe Government Strategy  \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n3. \n\nCambodia\u2019s  first  Social  and  Economic  Development  Plan  for  1996\u20132000  (SEDP  I) \n22. \nmarked the Government\u2019s first systematic approach to economic growth and poverty reduction \nwith the Government closely participating in the development process. The promotion of broad-\nbased sustainable economic growth as a strategy for poverty reduction continued in the second \nSEDP. Robust growth over the past decade and structural reforms have led to a steady decline \nin the overall incidence of poverty from an estimated 47%  in 1994 to 35% in 2004. The gains \nhave  been  widespread,  but  not  uniform,  with  the  incidence  of  rural  poverty  remaining  high  at \naround  39%  and  income  disparity  increasing  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  An  important \ncontributory  factor  is  that  economic  growth  has  been  narrowly  based  on  clothing  and  tourism, \nboth of which are urban focused with weak linkages to the rural economy. \n \n23. \nThe  Government  prepared  its  5-year  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP) \n2006\u20132010 in the context of a falling, but still high incidence of overall poverty, and a growing \nrural-urban  divide.  Approved  by  the  National  Assembly  in  May  2006,  the  NSDP  aims  to \noperationalize  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  (adopted  in  2004)  and  achieve  the \ninterim (2010) targets. The Rectangular Strategy sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda as a \nseries  of  four  interlocking  rectangles  with  governance  at  its  core.  One  of  the  four  strategies \nfocuses  on  the  environment  required  to  implement  and  promote  economic  growth  through \nagriculture,  infrastructure,  private  sector  growth  and  employment,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment. \n \n\n4. \n\nThe ADB Strategy  \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s  overarching  goal  in  Cambodia  is  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  In  line  with  the \npriorities and strategies identified in the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy (Figure 2), ADB\u2019s \ncountry  strategy  and  program 5   focuses  on  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  broad-based  economic \ngrowth  through  investments  in  physical  infrastructure,  development  of  the  financial  sector, \nsupport  for  greater  regional  integration,  sustainable  development  of  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises,  and  investments  in  agriculture  and  irrigation;  (ii)  inclusive  social  development \nthrough  basic  education,  empowerment  of  vulnerable  groups  such  as  women  and  ethnic \nminorities, control of communicable diseases, provision of rural water supply sanitation facilities, \nand  community-based  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources  in  the \nTonle  Sap  basin;  and  (iii)  good  governance,  through  improvements  in  public  financial \nmanagement \nthe  development  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures  and \ndecentralization  initiatives  to  strengthen  local  participation  in  government  and  improve  public \nservice delivery.   \n\nto  enhance \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2005.

The FSDS 2006\u20132015 (the updated blueprint) states that financial sector development \nis  not  an  end  in  itself;  rather  it  is  one  aspect  supporting  the  development  and  reduction  of \npoverty  in  Cambodia  (Figure  3).  While  much  work  is  needed  to  achieve  this  difficult  goal, \naccelerating  and  diversifying  growth  is  generally  accepted  as  key  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment  must  support  this  objective.  Reform  and  change  is  essential  for  growth.  At  the \nsame  time,  expanding  finance  brings  risks;  hence,  the  context  in  which  financial  development \noccurs must be carefully considered with a focus on prudential risk reduction, transparency, and \nuniform application of rules and regulations. \n \n \n \n\nFigure 3: Overview of the Second Financial Sector Program Cluster in relation to the FSDS 2006\u20132015 and\nCambodia\u2019s National Economic Development Goals\n\nFSDS 2006\u20132015\n-  increase competition \n-  maintain soundness \n-  integrate informal and formal sector \n-  increase efficiency \n\nIncreased resource mobilization, \nenhanced intermediation and risk \n\nSavers \n\nIntermediaries \nand Markets \n\nImprove confidence \nand financial \nintermediation \n-  Improve financial \n\nservices and upgrade \nthe payments system \n\n-  Enhance market \n\nconfidence \n\n-  Establish the registry \n\nfor tradable \ngovernment securities \n\n-  Promote outreach in \nthe formal sector \n\n \n\nMaintain stability in the \nfinancial sector \n-  Update legal and \n\nregulatory framework \n\n-  Strengthen bank \n\nsupervision capacity \n-  Strengthen prudential \n\nsupervision and \nregulations of MFIs \n\n-  Enhance legal \n\nfoundation to support \nfinancial and \ncommercial \ntransactions \n\n \n\nPromote good \ngovernance \n-  Promote international \n\ninitiatives on anti-\nmoney laundering and \ncounter financing of \nterrorism \n\n-  Enhance corporate \ngovernance and \ntransparency in the \ninsurance industry \n-  Establish commercial \ndispute resolution \nmechanism \n-  Develop the \n\naccounting and \nauditing profession \n\nSecond Financial Sector Program Cluster\n\n \nEconomic \ngrowth with \nequitable \ndistribution and \npoverty \nreduction \n\nInvestors\n\nEnhance efficiency\n-  Computerize and \nintegrate key \noperating \nfunctions of NBC  \n\n-  Upgrade the \n\ncapacity and skills \nof MFI staff \n\n \n \n\nFSDS = Financial Sector Development Strategy, MFI = microfinance institution, NBC = National Bank of Cambodia. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nThe expected overall impact of FSP II is a sound and market-based financial system that \n26. \nenhances  resource  mobilization  and  supports  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  expected \noutcome is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. Program formulation considered \nlessons from FSP I and past TAs to the sector.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n27. \nFSP  I  successfully  used  the  program  cluster  modality  with  two  tranches  under \nsubprograms  1  and  2  and  a  single  tranche  under  subprogram  3.  With  ADB\u2019s  financial  and \ntechnical  assistance,  Cambodia  has  achieved  substantial  progress  in  developing  the  financial \nsector  over  a  relatively  short  time.  In  recognition  that  program-based  lending  is  a  changing \nprocess,  the  development  community  is  promoting  results-based  approaches  with  growing \nfocus  on  understanding  the  political  economy  and  factors  that  help  shape  policy  reforms  and \nimplementation.  Interventions  are  increasingly  targeting  improved  partnerships  and  increased \ngovernment  ownership  through  the  delegation  of  more  rights  and  obligations  to  recipient \ncountries. These innovations allow governments\u2019 greater control over the details of development \nprogramming  and  policy  implementation;  enhance  ownership  of  the  development  process; \nprovide flexibility in resource use; and in principle, ensure greater predictability of aid funds tied \nto a country\u2019s budget cycle.6  \n \nSubprograms  and  Tranching. In view of the national election in July 2008 and recent \n28. \ndevelopments  in  the  banking  system,  FSP  II  will  adopt  the  program  cluster  approach.  The \nprogram  cluster  supports  a  policy  reform  program  anchored  on  the  FSDS  2006\u20132015;  it  was \nprepared by a joint team of Government and ADB representatives. The key features include (i) a \nseries  of  four  single-tranche  subprograms,  with  a  well-defined  medium-term  framework \nspecified  at  the  outset  and  including  key  reform  actions  to  be  completed  prior  to  Board \nconsideration; (ii) triggers7 for subsequent subprograms to ensure continuous dialogue between \nthe Government, ADB, and stakeholders; and (iii) a small number of well-targeted policy actions \ndesigned  to  achieve  high-impact  outcomes  in  priority  areas.  The  four  subprograms  are  to  be \nimplemented from September 2006 to 2010. Subprogram 1 has 14 key reform actions that the \nGovernment began implementing in September 2006. All have been completed prior to Board \ncirculation. Disbursement will follow after loan effectiveness.  \n \n29. \nLinks  between  Subprograms.  Subprograms  1  and  2  are  linked  by  key  actions \n(triggers) that are deemed essential for the success of the medium-term program. Progress with \nimplementation  of  these  key  actions  will  be  an  indicator  of  readiness  to  proceed  to  the  next \nsubprogram. Subprogram 2 covers January\u2013December 2008 and assuming good progress with \nimplementing the associated triggers and the Government\u2019s readiness to implement successive \ntriggers,  it  is  expected  to  be  processed  for  Board  approval  and  disbursement  in  December \n2008. Subprogram 3 covers January\u2013December 2009 and will be processed for Board approval \nand  disbursement  in  December  2009  based  on  the  progress  achieved  in  implementing  the \nrelated  triggers.  Subprogram  4  covers  January\u2013December  2010  and  will  be  processed  for \nBoard  approval  and  disbursement  in  December  2010  based  on  the  progress  achieved  in \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2006. Review of ADB Approach to Conditionality in the Context of Program Lending. Manila, Draft. \n7   These are specified prior actions that are deemed to be essential for achieving the expected results of the medium-\nterm program. Compliance with triggers is seen as indicating sufficient progress to move from one single-tranche \noperation to the next in programmatic lending. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13         \n\n \n\nimplementing  the  related  triggers.  The  time  frame  for  processing  subprograms  2,  3,  and  4  is \nonly  indicative.  Policy  conditions  for  subprograms  2,  3,  and  4  will  be  formulated  based  on \nprogress in implementing the key triggers. Reform measures may be added as necessary within \nthe  medium-term  framework  after  duly  considering  the  Government\u2019s  social  and  economic \nachievements  and  changes  in  the  macro  policy  environment.  The  development  policy  letter, \npolicy matrix, and medium-term framework are provided in Appendix 4.  \n \n30. \nFollowing  extensive  consultation  between  ADB  and  the  Government  and  related \nstakeholders  at  workshops  and  in  bilateral  discussions,  the  reforms  to  develop  the  banking, \ninsurance,  and  microfinance  subsectors;  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework;  and  support \nfinancial infrastructure including capacity development, were confirmed. These can be grouped \ninto the following broad development objectives: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n1. \n\nImprove confidence and financial intermediation. \nMaintain stability in the financial sector. \nPromote good governance. \nEnhance efficiency in the financial sector. \n\nImprove Confidence and Financial Intermediation \n\na. \n\n1.1 Improve Financial Services and the Payments, Clearance, and     \nSettlement System \n\nthe  current  system,  checks  are  manually  cleared  and  settled \n\n31. \nA payment, clearance, and settlement system is necessary for resource mobilization and \nservice  outreach;  for  development  of  money  and  interbank  markets;  and  to  support \nmacroeconomic policy implementation. Improving system will help restore confidence, enhance \ngrowth in financial intermediation and outreach, and encourage product and service innovation. \nThe vast majority of transactions in Cambodia are conducted in cash rather than by check; cash \ntransactions  are  estimated  to  be  mainly  in  dollars.  The  high  degree  of  dollarization  of  the \neconomy  is  understandable  given  Cambodia\u2019s  political  history  and  very  high  rates  of  inflation \nduring which the dollar proved to be a safeguard against potential losses in purchasing power. \nCredit  cards  are  accepted  at  only  a  few  establishments  and  no  more  than  about  50,000  debit \ncards have been issued to date, equivalent to less than 1% of the adult population. The debit \ncards can be used only in the automated teller machines (ATMs) of the issuing bank. \n \n32.  With \nthrough \nclearinghouses  operated  by  NBC  (in  Phnom  Penh,  Siem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville,  with  no \nelectronic  link  between  them).  Checks  are  presented  each  morning  at  9:30  a.m.,  and \ndishonored  checks  flow  back  through  the  system  at  3:00  p.m.  Settlement  from  clearing \noperations is recorded in the NBC books at each branch office. In view of this current archaic \nsystem, NBC places high priority on upgrading the payment and settlement system because (i) \nthe  rapidly  growing  economy  is  straining  the  existing  manual  system;  an  upgraded  system  is \nurgently required to support the larger, more complex financial transactions in the economy; and \n(ii)  moving  from  the  cash-based  to  a  check-based  treasury  accounts  system  would  enhance \npublic financial management capacities throughout government. To successfully implement the \npayments and settlement system upgrade, NBC has identified the need for a full-time resident \nadvisor  to  provide  guidance  and  support  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  modern \npayment and settlement system. Subsequent to NBC\u2019s requirements, TA resources have been \nidentified under FSP II to assist NBC in this area. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n\nThe  process  for  modernizing  the  national  payments  and  settlement  system  started  in \n33. \nlate 2004 when NBC established the Payments Policy Unit. With the required technical support, \nthis  unit  will  play  an  important  role  in  the  future  evolution  of  the  payment  system.  In  2005, \nCambodia  enacted  the  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment  Transactions,  which \nprovides a legal basis for negotiable instruments such as checks, bills of exchange, promissory \nnotes,  and  regulation  of  payment  systems.  Among  its  top  priorities,  the  Payments  Policy  Unit \nneeds to establish a relationship with all banks operating in Cambodia, to obtain their input on \nunit initiatives. Unit staff has commenced this consultation with banks to garner their support for \nimplementation  of  the  proposed  road  map  (Appendix  5)  to  modernize  the  payments  and \nsettlement  system.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC  has  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding \nwith  each  commercial  bank  endorsing  a  road  map  to  modernize  the  payment  and  settlement \nsystem. \n \n\n            b. \n\n1.2 Enhance Consumer Access to Credit and Market Confidence \n\n34. \nThe orderly development and expansion of the financial market requires knowledgeable \ncustomers  as  well  as  knowledgeable  suppliers.  It  also  requires  customers  to  be  able  to  make \ninformed decisions on the services they need and what those services are worth. Since 2005, \nall banks have been required to publish their audited financial statements to allow the general \npublic to make informed judgments regarding where to place their deposits and which bank to \ntransact with. Several banks have published these annual audited financial reports on their own \nwebsites, while others provide hard copies that are often out of stock. FSP II will support NBC in \nits efforts to promote bank transparency by requiring all audited financial statements of banks as \nwell  as  prudential  regulations  to  be  published  on  the  NBC  website.  This  will  help  promote \ntransparent and positive competition that will encourage public confidence, product and service \ninnovation, efficiency, and economies of scale. The recent high credit growth and high growth in \nbroad money supply requires close monitoring. NBC will provide periodic macroeconomic data \nfor ADB to assess the performance of the financial sector during subprogram 1. \n \n35. \nTo  improve  the  quality  of  credit  underwriting  and  portfolio  management,  and  boost  the \nconfidence  of  the  banking  system,  a  credible  credit  information  system  and  supporting \nregulations are needed. With close cooperation between NBC and the Association of Banks, a \npilot online credit information sharing system (CIS) was established in August 2006 to support \nthe credit appraisal processes of participating banks. The CIS is part of the Government\u2019s initial \nefforts  to  promote  sound  credit  assessment  and  risk  management  within  the  banking  system. \nRules, regulations, procedures, and a governing structure are in place, but implementation has \nnot met expectations. Several banks have not incorporated the need for regular queries to the \nCIS  into  their  internal  credit  appraisal  processes.  Participating  banks  report  that  since \nintroduction  of  the  CIS,  they  have  had  difficulty  getting  borrowers\u2019  consent  to  upload  credit \ninformation  regarding  loans  extended  before  August  2006  (this  is  not  a  problem  for  new \nborrowers since August 2006). Further, the CIS Steering Committee has not enforced its rules \nfor reporting. Several additions have been made to the system to allow \u201cno cases to report\u201d as a \nquick option for participating banks, which can then trigger a more focused follow-up by the CIS \nSteering  Committee.  Mechanisms  to  assist  the  reporting  requirements  of  the  CIS  Steering \nCommittee to the CIS Board of Directors are being developed. A number of actions are being \ntaken  under  the  Small-and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Development  Program  to  build  steering \ncommittee capacity to work with the system. The Government will continue to strengthen bank \ncompliance  and  intends  to  establish  an  appropriate  minimum  threshold  to  allow  MFIs  to \nparticipate.  Support  under  subprogram  1  is  expected  to  continue  familiarizing  all  stakeholders \nwith the system and help with any important changes to the governing structure of the CIS that \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15         \n\n \n\nmay  be  necessary  for  its  effectiveness.  The  Government  intends  to  move  the  CIS  into  a \ncorporation (so that it may function as a credit bureau) with private sector ownership involved.  \n \n\nc. \n\n1.3 Establish a Registry for Tradable Government Securities \n\n36. \nThe Law on Government Securities, enacted in January 2007, provides a framework for \nthe efficient issuance and management of government securities. This in turn is to ensure that \nthe Government\u2019s financing needs and payment obligations are met at the lowest possible cost, \nand  will  provide  key  information  to  financial  sector  participants  through  the  development  of  a \nyield curve. NBC has been assigned the role of maintaining the registry function. In preparation \nfor the issuance of government securities and as part of the triggers for subprogram 2, NBC will \nestablish the registry and train the staff on its operation and procedures. \n \n\nd. \n\n1.4 Promote Outreach in the Formal Sector  \n\nfrom \n\ntransition \n\nCambodia\u2019s \n\nformal  microfinance \n\nindustry  has  undergone  a \n\n37. \nthe \ndevelopment model to a fully commercial model, although some funding is still channeled from \naid  organizations  and  their  affiliates.  In  addition,  a  large  number  of  money  changers  (who  are \nrequired  to  be  registered),  money  lenders  (who  are  not  required  to  be  registered),  about  60 \nunrestricted  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other  participants  operate  across  the  country. \nBy  some  estimates,  the  informal  sector  has  a  greater  share  by  value  and  number  of \ntransactions  undertaken  within  the  economy,  (especially  within  the  poor  and  remote  rural \npopulation)  than  the  formal  sector,  which  comprises  registered  banks  and  both  licensed  and \nregistered  MFIs.  At  present,  no  reliable  data  is  available  on  the  actual  size  and  scale  of  the \ninformal financial sector.  \n \n38. \nAn  understanding  of  the  size  and  depth  of  the  MFI  subsector  outside  of  the  formal \nfinancial sector needs to be established to help determine the needed policy, both macro and \nmicro, and amount of assistance needed to develop the subsector. A survey would be useful to \ngather  information  on  nonlicensed  MFIs  outside  the  formal  sector  and  their  impact  on  the \neconomy. It would include data on size, scale, and scope; and cover both products offered and \nlocations  serviced.  Both  NBC  (for  licensing  and  supervision  purposes)  and  MEF  (policy \nformulation) have agreed to jointly undertake this survey as one of the triggers for subprogram 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nMaintain Stability in the Financial Sector \n\na. \n\n2.1 Update the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Banks \n\n39. \nSince  the  adoption  of  the  Law  on  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions  in  1999,  a \ncomprehensive  review  of  this  law  is  needed  to  effectively  address  the  features  of  a  changing \ndomestic  market  and  the  reality  of  increasing  international  economic  integration.  The  review \nshould  take  into  consideration  consumer  protection  in  connection  with  the  use  of  debit  and \ncredit cards, and bank secrecy provisions to  support development of the CIS; and procedures \nfor administering distressed and insolvent banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. \nThe revised law is to be submitted to the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly during \nFSP  II.  NBC  will  introduce  all  the  appropriate  core  principles  of  Basel  I  (asset  grading  and \nprovisioning,  large  exposures,  and  treatment  of  related  party  transactions)  to  ensure  that \nportfolio  data,  including  nonperforming  loans,  are  properly  reported  and  appropriate  actions \ntaken  in  a  timely  manner.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC  has  issued  (i)  regulations  on  large \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n\nexposures  of  banks  and  financial  institutions,  and  (ii)  regulations  to  amend  the  prakas 8   on \nlicensing of commercial and specialized banks. \n \n\nb. \n\n2.2 Strengthen Supervision Capacity for Banks \n\n40. \nUpdating  and  upgrading  skills  is  a  priority  area  that  must  be  an  ongoing  feature  of \ndevelopment and deepened in line with the deepening of the financial system. As the number of \nfinancial institutions increases, new products and services will need to be developed. New risks \nwill  emerge  requiring  that  skills  development  and  training  be  pursued  in  tandem  with  these \ndevelopments. NBC will continue to strengthen and upgrade the capacity of its own supervision \nstaff to be able to effectively manage these developments. At the same time, NBC recognizes \nthat  the  financial  sector  is  still  in  its  early  stage  of  development  and  thus  will  strengthen  its \nsurveillance mechanisms. IMF has been providing a resident adviser to help develop the off-site \ncapability  of  the  supervision  staff  together  with  an  on-site  supervision  expert  to  help  NBC \nundertake  regular  on-site  examinations  of  some  high-risk  banks.  IMF  has  agreed  to  continue \nthis technical support.  \n \n41. \nNBC has identified the need for ADB support for the on-site supervision of the remaining \nbanks. This is very important in view of the rapid increase in the number and size of loans and \nconcern  with  the  quality  of  information  reported  by  banks.  NBC  has  formulated  remedial \nmeasures,  broadly  anchored  on  the  policy  matrix  and  program  policy  framework,  covering \nstronger  sanctions  to  help  it  address  potential  vulnerabilities  in  the  banking  system.  NBC  will \nclosely monitor progress with implementation of the remedial measures and ADB will regularly \nreview  progress  reports.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC  has  (i)  assessed  and  identified  capacity \nbuilding  needs  for  banking  supervision,  and  (ii) strengthened  surveillance  and  has undertaken \nprompt  corrective  measures  for  banks  that  are  not  conforming  to  the  laws  and  prudential \nregulations. \n \n\nc. \n\n2.3 Strengthen Prudential Supervision and Regulations for MFIs \n\n42. \nFinancial  regulation  and  supervision  are  essential  to  protect  against  financial  crisis  not \nonly through the protection provided by the regulator but also through incentives and guidance \ngiven  to  financial  institutions  through  regulations  and  surveillance  to  enhance  their  own \noperations.  NBC  made  very  good  progress  in  building  the  regulatory  framework  for  licensing \nand  supervising  licensed  and  registered  MFIs.  A  division  for  prudential  supervision  of  MFIs, \nestablished  within  NBC\u2019s  Banking  Supervision  Department,  has  issued  several  prudential \nregulations in the form of prakas. These regulations aim to promote public confidence, support \nbest practices and transparency, and prevent fraud and illegal activities. Staff of the division has \nhad  some  training  through  technical  support9  from  ADB  to  undertake  off-site  and,  to  a  limited \nextent,  on-site  supervision.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC  has  issued  regulations  to  amend  the \nprakas on the licensing of microfinance institutions. \n \n\n  \n\nd. \n\n2.4 Enhance Legal Foundation to Support Financial and Commercial \nTransactions \n\n43. \nFor finance to develop beyond basic, short-term, and mainly cash-based transactions, a \nrule of law system for  commerce  and finance must be developed, updated, and implemented. \n\n                                                 \n8   Khmer name for regulations or instructions issued by the NBC governor or a government minister. \n9   ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Financial  Sector  Program  Implementation. \n\nManila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17         \n\n \n\nProgress in preparing and enacting a number of components of the legal framework for financial \nand commercial transactions has been significant. This includes the Insurance Law, Accounting \nand  Auditing  Law,  Commercial  Enterprises  Law,  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment \nTransactions  Law,  Commercial  Arbitration  Law,  Secured  Transactions  Law,  Government \nSecurities  Law,  Civil  Procedures  Code,  and  Law  on  Anti-Money  Laundering  and  Counter \nFinancing  of  Terrorism.  Most  of  the  enacted  laws  have  been  implemented  and  training \ncurriculum introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and judges on these \nnew  principles.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  has  undertaken  a  series  of  public \nengagements to create public awareness nationwide. Laws that were recently enacted require \nthe  adoption  of  implementing  subdecrees  and  the  Government  will  develop  the  subdecree  for \nthe  Secured  Transactions  Law;  and  develop  and  adopt  subdecrees  for  the  Commercial \nArbitration  Law  and  Anti-Money  Laundering  and  Counter  Financing  of  Terrorism  Law.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  MEF  submitted  the  draft  law  on  nongovernment  securities  to  the  National \nAssembly and on 12 September 2007 the National Assembly adopted the law. \n \n44. \nThe Government has requested ADB support to complete the drafting of a new law on \ncommercial contracts. The new law would supplement the Civil Code provisions with regard to \ncontract law, and the 1988 Decree on Contract and Other Liabilities. The proposed law will help \nincrease reliance on and confidence in the use of written commercial contracts in Cambodia for \na  variety  of  business  transactions.  FSP  II  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  review \nCambodia\u2019s requirements for a detailed set of rules for commercial transactions, review relevant \ninternational  models  and  approaches,  and  help  draft  a  new  harmonized  law  on  commercial \ncontracts  for  submission  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  National  Assembly.  The  new  law  is \nexpected to include general provisions relating to agencies and franchising.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPromote Good Governance \n\na. \n\n3.1 Promote International Initiatives on Anti-Money Laundering and \nCounter- Financing of Terrorism \n\n45.  Work  to  implement  an  anti-money  laundering  and  counter-financing  of  terrorism  (AML \nand CFT) regime in Cambodia will support international efforts to deter money laundering and \nfinancing  of  terrorism  activities,  and  promote  standard  governance  principles.  This  will  help \nrestore market confidence and discipline. A pilot Financial Intelligence Unit was established in \nJune  2005  with  six  staff  under  NBC\u2019s  Bank  Supervision  Department  to  help  with  the  initial \npreparations.  Throughout  2005  and  2006,  NBC  and  AUSTRAC  conducted  joint  training \nworkshops on AML and CFT in general, including procedures to assess suspicious transactions \nreports,  the  roles  of  compliance  officers  at  banks  and  financial  institutions,  and  conducted  an \nAML  and  CFT  assessment.  Subprogram  1  has  supported  the  Government  in  its  successful \nefforts to adopt the law on AML and CFT. This will be followed by the adoption of subdecrees \nfor  establishing  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  and  coordinating  AML  and  CFT  activities  in \nsubsequent subprograms. \n \n\nb. \n\n3.2 Enhance Corporate Governance and Transparency in the \nInsurance Industry \n\n46. \nBuilding  consumer  confidence  in  insurance  as  a  service  will  first  require  public \nunderstanding of the business of insurance and the services it can provide. Business must be \nconducted  as  transparently  as  possible  to  protect  consumers,  and  ensure  that  information \nprovided to the regulator and the general public is accurate. FSP I helped MEF implement the \nInsurance Law, establish the Insurance Supervisory Unit, provide training support for unit staff, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n\nintroduce the regulatory framework for new insurance products, and promote restructuring of the \nstate-owned insurance firm and involvement of the private sector in the industry. The profile of \nthe  industry  is  still  low  and  market  size  is  very  small.  Under  subprogram  1,  MEF  has  issued \nregulations  on  (i)  premium  rates  for  fire  insurance,  and  on  (ii)  licensing  of  general  and  life \ninsurance companies. \n \n47. \nTo  enhance  the  credibility  of  the  insurance  industry,  the  goal  for  all  participants  is  to \nraise  their  operations  to  international  standards.  Companies  with  international  shareholders \nhave introduced these standards to Cambodia. The regulator and the reinsurer are responsible \nfor reinforcing these standards. The Government and the insurance association can contribute \nto development of the insurance industry by increasing public awareness about insurance, and \nthe regulator could take a leadership role by ensuring transparency within the industry, with the \ngeneral  public,  and  with  other  government  ministries.  The  trigger  for  subprogram  2  involves \nsupport  to  MEF  in  preparing  and  adopting  an  appropriate  reporting  standard  for  insurance \ncompanies.  \n \n\nc. \n\n3.3 Establish Commercial Dispute Resolution Mechanism \n\n48. \nTo  promote  good  governance  and  boost  public  confidence  in  the  financial  system,  the \nGovernment  enacted  the  Law  on  Commercial  Arbitration  in  2006  and  the  subdecree \nestablishing  a  national  arbitration  center  is  scheduled  to  be  adopted  in  2007.  The  arbitration \ncenter  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  commercial  and  financial  systems, \nand  provide  the  commercial  community  with  a  cost-effective  process  for  dispute  resolution \nbased on the rule of law. With increased public awareness of the functioning of the arbitration \ncenter,  confidence  in  the  financial  sector  should  increase.  However,  before  the  center  can \ncommence  operation,  members  of  the  judiciary,  legal  profession  and  management  personnel \nwill need to be trained. FSP II will support MOC\u2019s efforts to establish a national arbitration center \nwith the development and adoption of the implementing subdecree, as well as appropriate rules \nand procedures for commercial arbitration by the Council of Ministers. \n \n\nd. \n\n3.4 Strengthen the Accounting Institutions and Member\u2019s \nProfessional Capacity \n\n49. \nFor  efficient  financial  intermediation,  financial  market  infrastructure  needs  to  be \ndeveloped,  particularly  accounting  and  auditing  systems,  supporting  legal  framework,  and \nqualified  personnel  to  implement  them.  Key  accounting  and  auditing  initiatives  implemented \nunder  FSP  I  include  the  (i)  adoption  of  a  law  on  corporate  accounts,  their  audit,  and  the \naccounting  profession;  (ii)  establishment  of  a  national  accounting  council  to  set  and  interpret \nstandards;  (iii)  introduction  of  requirements  that  international  accounting  standards  and \ninternational standard on auditing be applied to all companies incorporated in Cambodia; and (iv) \nestablishment  of  an  association  of  accountants  and  auditors  (Kampuchea  Institute  of  Certified \nPublic  Accountants  and  Auditors),  its  bylaws,  a  code  of  ethics  that  complies  with  the \nrequirements  of  the  International  Federation  of Accountants,  and  establishment  of committees \non  education  and  ethics  within  the  association.  In  2005  only  10  locally  qualified  accountants \nwere working in the system. \n \n50. \nSubsequent updates of FSP I introduced an initiative to improve accounting and auditing \ncapacity through a Government-funded scholarship scheme to assist at least 70 candidates per \nyear to train toward the qualification needed to become members of the Kampuchea Institute of \nCertified  Public  Accountants  and  Auditors.  Up  to  2005,  these  scholarships  were  awarded  to \ngovernment civil servants only. A significant number of these students dropped out for various \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19         \n\n \n\nreasons, including the difficulty of the course, they did not see the advantage of continuing, or \nthey  changed  departments  and  were  too  busy.  With  the  very  poor  results  and  through  policy \ndialogue,  this  was  opened  to  the  general  public  and  selection  to  be  based  on  merit.  This \ncommenced  in  2006  and  the  results  have  greatly  improved.  Under  subprogram  1,  MEF  has \nissued  regulations  for  the  criteria  that  would  qualify  enterprises  for  external  auditing. \nSubprogram 2 will continue to support this scholarship scheme. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnhance Efficiency in the Financial Sector \n\na. \n\n4.1 Computerize and Integrate Key Operating Functions of NBC  \n\n51. \nCentral  banks  around  the  world  perform  a  range  of  services  to  assist  the  sound \nfunctioning of the economies in which they operate. The key functions of central banks in most \ndeveloping countries include (i) operating monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability, or \nat  least  a  low  rate  of  inflation;  (ii)  monitoring  the  soundness  of  the  banking  system,  and \nproviding  a  clearinghouse  and  settlement  accounts  for  clearing  interbank  payments;  and  (iii) \nacting  as  a  banker  for  the  Government  and  other  financial  sector  institutions.  In  Cambodia, \nwhere  the  dollar  is  now  the  most  widely  used  currency,  NBC  cannot  fully  operate  monetary \npolicy  in  the  conventional  sense.  It  requires  an  efficient,  effective,  and  reliable  information \nsystem to help NBC\u2019s Management perform the above core functions.  \n \n52. \nNBC\u2019s  current  information  technology  system  is  not  well-integrated  across  the  bank, \nresulting  in  duplication  and  inefficiency.  NBC  would  gain  considerable  benefits,  in  terms  of \nability  to  provide  a  more  efficient  service  to  the  banking  sector,  with  the  implementation  of  an \nintegrated  system  that  initially  links  the  accounting  department  to  the  cash  management \nfunctions  in  the  issues  department,  the  customer  account  management  in  the  banking \noperations  department,  and  the  foreign  exchange  transactions  in  the  exchange  management \ndepartment.  Eventually  the  system  should  also  link  the  accounting  department  to  the  NBC \nbranches  to  promote  financial  deepening  and  operating  efficiency.  A  wide  area  network \ninfrastructure will be established at NBC to facilitate real-time clearing and settlement operations \nwith  head  offices  of  all  commercial  banks  in  Phnom  Penh.  Under  subprogram  1,  NBC  has \nreviewed and adopted the information technology architecture model.  \n \n53. \nSubsequent  subprograms  will  support  NBC  to  develop  its  overall  management \ninformation system requirements, restructure its chart of accounts, prepare bidding documents \nfor  its  enhanced  integrated  information  technology  system,  procure  software  and  hardware \nthrough a competitive bidding process, install the systems, and train the system and user staff. \nBenefit  will  also  be  gained  by  providing  improved  application  software  for  other  parts  of  the \nbank\u2014departments  that  do  not  need  to  link  to  the  core  banking  system  in  real  time,  such  as \nbanking supervision, personnel, and economic research and statistics. The total estimated cost \nis $4.6 million (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n\n \n\nb. \n\n4.2 Upgrade the Capacity of MFI Staff \n\nFinding  adequately  trained  and  skilled  people  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing \n54. \nmicrofinance  industry  continues  to  be  an  ongoing  challenge.  Growth  puts  pressure  on  the \ndelivery  and  customer  sides  of  the  business.  Capacity  building  structures  are  needed  within \nMFIs.  The  Center  for  Banking  Studies  will  (in  consultation  with  the  association  of  MFIs) \nundertake  a  review  of  its  curriculum  with  the  objective  of  expanding  the  scope  of  training  to \ninclude  all  aspects  of  MFI  business  and  increase  management  awareness  of  liquidity  risk, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n \n\ninterest  rate  risk,  concentration  of  credit  risk,  and  foreign  exchange  risk.  These  courses  will \ntarget midlevel staff and managers.  \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features  \n\n55. \nFSP II has several distinct features. First, the Government has shown strong ownership \nand commitment in formulating a 10-year rolling financial sector strategy to guide reforms in the \nsector.  FSP  II  was  formulated  within  the  FSDS  2006\u20132015  framework  and  draws  on  ADB\u2019s \nexperience and lessons from implementing FSP I and related TA projects in the sector.  \n \n56. \nSecond,  the  Government  under  FSP  II  will  continue  to  pursue,  as  it  did  under  FSP  I, \nphased incremental development of markets that deepens the capacity for resource mobilization \nand risk allocation. This is to be carried out in a manner that is relevant to the country\u2019s needs \nand  based  on  realistic  standards  and  expectations.  The  high  level  support  provided  by  the \nFinancial  Sector  Steering  Committee  (FSSC),  chaired  by  the  NBC  governor,  will  facilitate \ncoordination and guide program implementation to achieve the expected outcomes. \n \n57. \nThird, interventions will be implemented in a systematic manner to ensure that (i) market \ndevelopment  parallels  institutional  and  capacity  developments,  (ii)  linkages  across  subsectors \nare  exploited,  and  (iii)  corresponding  risks  are  mitigated.  These  interventions  can  continue \nthrough to subprograms 2, 3, and 4; and will be supported by TA funds to build understanding of \nrisks, formulate mitigation measures, and implement key reform activities. \n \n58. \nFourth,  the  FSP  II  cluster  with  four  single-tranche  subprograms  is  an  appropriate \ninstrument  for  maintaining  ADB\u2019s  results-oriented  partnership  with  the  Government  in \ndeveloping  the  financial  sector.  FSP  II  provides  a  set  of  policy  triggers  for  subprograms  2,  3, \nand 4 that focus on results and outcomes. Since the Government determines the pace at which \nthe  triggers  are  to  be  implemented,  this  approach  encourages  government  ownership  of  the \nreform program; flexibility in the implementation agenda; and the opportunity for policy dialogue \ninvolving the Government, ADB, and other key stakeholders in the event that economic, social, \nand political circumstances change. The Government\u2019s commitment to FSP II is clear from the \nFSP I results and the development policy letter. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n59. \nThe program cluster approach involves four back-to-back subprograms for a total that is \nnot  to  exceed  $40,000,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of $10,000,000 \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for subprogram 1. The loan will be disbursed in \na  single  tranche  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  specific  conditions  indicated  in  the  policy \nmatrix.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of 8  years,  and  an  interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Part of the loan \nproceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  computerization  of  NBC\u2019s  core  functions.  MEF  and  NBC \nhave  agreed  to  use  the  Government\u2019s  standard  operating  procedures  for  procurement  and \nfunds transfer. The loan amounts for the three subsequent subprograms will be determined for a \ncomparable amount and be processed sequentially upon completion of a set of triggers.  \n \n60. \nThe ADB funds are to support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter and \npolicy  matrix.  The  loan  amount  was  determined  by  the  strength  of  the  policy  package,  its \ndevelopment  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sector  covered,  and  the  development  financing \nneeds  of  the  Government,  as  estimated  by  MEF  (Table  3).  The  Government\u2019s  gross  and  net \nfinancing needs will be significant if it is to sustain economic growth above 8% over the medium \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21         \n\n \n\nterm and reduce poverty from 35%. The Government aims to increase development and social \nspending  during  2007\u20132010,  and  as  a  result  envisages  a  targeted  Government  deficit \n(excluding  grants)  in  the  range  of  3.0%\u20133.3%  of  GDP  in  2007  and  over  the  next  2  years. \nAccording  to  MEF  budget  reports,  the  total  net  financing  (primarily  external)  requirements  for \n2008\u20132009  are  estimated  at  KR1,886  billion,  excluding  grants  ($460  million  equivalent).  The \nGovernment\u2019s  debt  management  strategy  is  to  continue  with  external  concessional  debt  and \ngrant  financing  of  its  budget.  Over  the  longer  term,  the  Government  envisages  a  reduction  in \nexternal debt as a share of GDP as the economy continues to expand at a rapid pace and in \nanticipation of oil revenues (although these are of uncertain magnitude and timing). Recent debt \nassessments  by  IMF  indicate  that  the  Government\u2019s  debt  stock  and  servicing  costs  are \nsustainable over the medium-term provided macroeconomic performance (high growth and low \ninflation)  continue  and  budget  revenue  growth  remains  on  track.  External  debt  to  GDP  is \nexpected  to  continue  its  decline  from  currently  31%  in  2007  to  28%  by  2008  primarily  due  to \neconomic growth. The current macroeconomic and fiscal environment provides ideal conditions \nfor further reforms in the financial sector, among others. The subprogram 1 loan will help close \nthe financing gap for 2008\u20132009 and support the Government\u2019s reforms to the financial sector.  \n \n\nTable 3: Cambodia\u2019s Projected Financing Requirements for 2007\u20132009 \n\n \nFinancing Mix \nNet external financing requirement \n \nProgrammed external borrowing and grants \nADB\u2019s planned disbursements b\n\n       of which: \n\nFSP II subprogram 1 loan in 2007 \n\nOther development partners \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, FSP II = Second Financial Sector Program Cluster  \na  Preliminary estimates.  \nb  Proposed disbursements for 2007\u20132009 as outlined in the ADB Country Operations Business Plan (2007\u2013\n\n2009).  \n\nSources: Ministry of Economy and Finance, and Asian Development Bank.  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n460a\n \n \n182 \n \n10 \n278 \n\nNBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  the  implementing  agencies  for \n61. \nFSP II. The FSSC, established under FSP I, will continue to coordinate program implementation \namong  government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned.  To  ensure \ntimely  program \nimplementation,  the  FSSC,  comprising  senior  officers  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  other \ngovernment  agencies  concerned,  will  meet  as  required  to  review  progress  reports  from  the \ntechnical working group and consider pending issues. The FSSC will propose concrete actions \nto resolve those issues. A senior NBC officer will be appointed program director to assist NBC, \nMEF,  and  MOC  in  coordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The  program  director  will \nbe  required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  subprogram  implementation,  in  particular \nprogress on implementing the policy actions adopted for FSP II. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n\n2.  \n\nPeriod of Implementation  \n\nThe implementation period for subprogram 1 is from September 2006 to December 2007. \n\n62. \nThe Government has completed all actions for the release of the single tranche. \n \n\n3.  \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n63. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  a \nnegative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6),  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in,  and  originating  from \nADB  member  countries  will  be  made  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  standard  public  sector  procedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans \n(1998),  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  as  the  Borrower.  The \nGovernment will certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to, or exceeds, \nthe amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan in a given period; and (ii) the loan \nproceeds will be utilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed \nbased on the certification provided by the Government, which confirms that the requirements for \nloan have been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify \nthe  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  certification.  FSP  II  will  provide  for  retroactive  financing  for \nexpenditures incurred by the Government up to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.  \n\n \n4.  \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary issues \n\n64. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the  Policy  on  Combating \nMoney Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant ADB guidelines and \nthe  loan  regulations  were  specifically  brought  to  the  attention  and  notice  of  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the \nProgram. \n \n65. \nAn assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter  understand  the  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  arrangements  for  the  fiduciary \narrangements  of  FSP  II.  Discussions  were  held  with  the  Government  during  formulation  of  \nFSP II on the funds flow from NBC to MEF and the contribution of the ongoing public financial \nmanagement10 reform program to the administration of loan proceeds. The 2007 budget for the \nfirst time presented some information on development spending; good progress in strengthening \ndebt  management  was  also  noted.  Measures  were  adopted  in  January  2007  to  streamline \ncommitments  and  payment  processes,  and  reduce  outstanding  arrears.  Very  satisfactory \nprogress  has  been  noted  in  revenue  collections  with  greater  use  of  the  banking  system  to \nstreamline  revenue  collection  and  payment  processes.

Phnom Penh. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\naccounts  and  budget  classification  has  been  substantially  completed  to  improve  expenditure \ntracking  and  reporting.  As  part  of  efforts  to  improve  governance  and  reduce  corruption,  the \nGovernment  continues  to  place  significant  emphasis  on  strengthening  the  overall  public \nfinancial  management  system,  internal  systems  (including  internal  audit  functions),  and  the \nfunctions  of  the  National  Audit  Authority.  The  ongoing  public  financial  management  program, \nwhich  started  in  2004,  supported  by  10  development  partners 11  including  ADB,  has  helped \nlower the fiduciary risk of the system.  \n \nA  core  component  of  FSP  II  focuses  on  promoting  good  governance,  deterring  money \n66. \nlaundering  and  financing  of  terrorism  activities,  and  implementing  measures  that  will  help \nreduce  corruption  in  the  overall  sector  (A  Good  Governance  Framework  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  B).  FSP  II  includes  measures  to  improve  the  management  information  system  and \nreporting  standards  within  NBC,  banks,  and  MFIs;  promote  the  transparency  of  information \nreleased by banks and MFIs; improve compliance with and usefulness of the credit information-\nsharing  system;  support  implementation  of  AML  regulations;  and  deter  activities  that  could \nsupport the financing of terrorism. The increasing use of payment instruments other than cash \nwill  help  discourage  corruption  particularly  at  central,  provincial,  and  district  treasuries.  These \nreforms  will  help  keep  savers  and  investors  informed,  empower  civil  society  to  monitor  the \nweaknesses  in  these  financial  institutions,  and  deter  those  that  are  vulnerable  to  corrupt \nactivities. \n \n\n5.  \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n67. \nThe  Government  will  open  an  account  with  NBC  to  receive  the  loan  proceeds.  It  will \nmanage, operate, and liquidate the account in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. ADB \nwill retain the right to audit any account and records relating to utilization of the loan proceeds.  \n \n\n6.  \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Review \n\n68. \nThe program director (para. 61) will coordinate and submit quarterly progress reports on \npolicy  and  institutional  reform  implementation  to  the  FSSC  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  be \nsubmitted in such form and in such detail as ADB may request, and include (i) progress made \nand  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  (ii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy \nproblems encountered, and (iii) proposed detailed activities planned for the next review period. \nThe  Government  will  inform  ADB  of  outcomes  of  policy  discussions  with  IMF,  World  Bank \ngroup, and bilateral funding agencies that have implications for FSP II implementation. \n \n69. \nADB,  in  cooperation  with  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  will  conduct  semiannual  reviews  of \nprogram implementation progress, and assess the impact on the financial and related sectors of \nthe  economy.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  to  engage  in  active  policy  dialogue \nthroughout  FSP  II  implementation  on  issues  that  may  affect  financial  sector  development  and \nadditional  reforms  that  may  be  necessary  or  desirable  for  sustainable  development  of  the \nfinancial  sector.  On  completion  of  FSP  II,  and  not  later  than  3  months  after  completion,  the \nGovernment will prepare and submit to ADB a program completion report. \n \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB, Australia, Department for International Development, European Community, French Cooperation, IMF, Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  Swedish  International  Development  Agency,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, and World Bank. \n\n\f \n\n24 \n \n\nV.  \n\nFSP II IMPLEMENTATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n70. \nIn  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  has  prepared  a  TA  project  to  support \nNBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in  preparing  and  implementing  key  policy  reforms  under  subprogram  1 \nand reform triggers for subprogram 2, as well as to provide the Government with timely policy \nadvice on a demand basis. The objective of the TA is to provide assistance to the Government \nto  find  practical  solutions  to  address  these  issues,  as  well  as  to  deepen  the  Government\u2019s \nreform  agenda  in  the  financial  sector.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  of  $2,000,000 \nequivalent. Cofinancing includes $750,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, $500,000 from the \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (funded by the Republic of Korea), and $450,000 from \nthe  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Fund  (funded  by \nthe  Government  of \nLuxembourg).  ADB  will  administer  the  cofinancing.  NBC,  MEF  and  MOC  will  provide  the \nremaining $300,000 equivalent in the form of office space, counterpart staff, and other support \nfacilities. The main activities of the TA will support (i) modernization of the payments, clearance, \nand  settlement  system  (12  person-months);  (ii)  implementation  of  the  information  technology \ncomponent  to  computerize  NBC\u2019s  core  functions  (26.5  person-months);  (iii)  bank  supervision \nand surveillance (4 person-months); (iv) the Financial Intelligence Unit for AML surveillance (3 \nperson-months);  (v) regulations  and  supervision  of  MFIs  (4  person-months);  (vi) \nthe \nestablishment of the national arbitration center (3 person-months); (vii) training under the Center \nfor  Banking  Studies  (3  person-months);  (viii)  legal  and  regulatory  development  (5.5  person-\nmonths);  and  TA  project  management  (4  person-months).  Two  national  consultants  will  be \nrequired:  an  information  technology  expert  (20  person-months)  and  a  legal  expert  (4  person-\nmonths).  A  total  of  89  person-months  of  consulting  inputs  are  required  comprising  65 \ninternational and 24 national person-months. Experience in Cambodia has shown that firms, as \nopposed to individual consultants, have been more expensive and have not been successful in \nrecruiting  the  right  mix  of  consultants,  especially  when  the  project  requires  a  diverse  set  of \nexpertise. Because of the varying nature of expertise, the consultants will be engaged by ADB \non  an  individual  basis  to  implement  TA  activities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  using  the  competitive  selection \nmethod.  The  TA  purpose,  outputs,  methodology,  implementation  arrangements,  budget,  and \nterms of references are in Appendix 7. NBC will be the Executing Agency, and MEF and MOC \nthe implementing agencies. \n \n\nVI.  \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA.  \n\nBenefits \n\n71.  With  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  economy  that  requires  a  sound  financial  system  to \nsustain  the  growth  rate,  the  Government  needs  to  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing \nfinancial resources, channeling them to productive investments, and managing inherent risks, if \nit  is  to  achieve  long-term  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Asian \nfinancial crisis provided many examples of the devastating impact that financial crises can have \non  countries,  wiping  out  several  years  of  growth  within  a  very  short  time.  Thus  to  promote \neconomic growth, reduce poverty, and help Cambodia avoid financial crises, FSP II will support \nthe Government in its development agenda. \n \n72. \nThe  policies  supported  by  FSP  II  will  help  reduce  information  asymmetry,  improve \ngovernance,  enhance  financial  stability,  and  improve  efficiency  in  the  financial  sector.  These \nfactors  will  contribute  to  a  more  conducive  environment  for  continued  financial  market \ndevelopment.  FSP  II  is  expected  to  boost  confidence  among  market  participants  and,  with \nimprovements to the payments, clearance, and settlement system, financial intermediation will \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25         \n\n \n\ngrow  resulting  in  a  wider  offering  of  products  and  services in  urban  and  rural  areas.  A  sound, \nmore efficient, and diversified financial sector will support higher investments and productivity in \nthe  private  sector.  Together  with  broader  economic  reforms  in  Cambodia,  the  reforms  in  the \nfinancial sector will contribute to higher economic growth. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n73. \nFSP  II  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a  negative  impact  on \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement, \nimpact on indigenous people, and impact on the environment. FSP II is a general intervention \naimed  at  supporting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  in  that  respect  is  expected  to  have  an \nindirect positive effect on poverty reduction (Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \u2013 \nAppendix 8). \n \nC.    Assumptions and Risks \n\nFSP  II  assumes  political  stability  in  Cambodia  and  sustained  implementation  of  sound \n74. \nmacroeconomic policies by the Government. Given Cambodia\u2019s encouraging results in the past \ndecade,  both  these  assumptions  are  valid  and  defensible.  However,  implementation  of  FSP  II \ncould face a number of risks; for which mitigation measures have been put in place.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nExogenous  shocks.  The  external  environment  may  deteriorate  if  persistently \nhigh oil prices impede world economic growth and trade, and create unfavorable \nconditions  in  world  financial  markets.  External  shocks  would  result  in  slower \ngrowth  in  Cambodia.  To  a  certain  extent,  this  risk  could  be  mitigated  by  the \npotential  supply  of  oil  from  Cambodia\u2019s  own  petroleum  deposits.  To  date, \nCambodia  continues  to  show  high  resilience  to  oil  price  shocks.  Concerns  also \nfocus on the high growth in credit over the past 2 years. Along with foreign direct \ninvestment  inflows,  rapid  credit  expansion  is  adding  to  growth  in  real  estate \ninvestment because of rising property prices, and is causing the assets of some \nbanks  to  be  increasingly  vulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  The  Government  and \nADB will undertake periodic macroeconomic reviews to assess potential risks to \nthe financial sector during FSP II. \n\nUnexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia  has  been  enjoying  very  high \npolitical unity and stability for several years. The national election scheduled for \nJuly 2008, while it may not pose a political risk, could cause material risk in terms \nof  delaying  the  law-making  process  during  the  preelection  period  when \ngovernment officials are preoccupied with the upcoming elections. In preparation \nfor such a scenario, FSP II is designed to ensure that most of the legal drafting \nthat  closely  involves  midlevel  officials  will  be  completed  prior  to  the  general \nelection. Once the Government is formed, hopefully in 2008, draft laws would be \nready for submission to the Council of Ministers for discussion. Sufficient time is \nfactored into the program design.  \n\n(iii) \n\nPoor  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak  governance  and \nincidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor  confidence  and  prevent  the \nattainment  of  expected  sector  outcomes.  The  Government\u2019s  NSDP  views \ncorruption  as  a  threat  to  sustained  growth  and  development  of  the  country  in \ngeneral. Backed by an active development partner community, the Government \nis increasingly taking a tougher stand against corruption. The general consensus \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n26 \n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nis  that  good  governance  and  measures  to  address  corruption  are  needed  for  a \nsuccessful  partnership  between \nthe  development \ncommunity.  These  were  considered  in  the  design  of  FSP  II  with  continued \ntargeted  improvements  to  the  institutional  governance  structure,  accounting \nlegislation, \ndisclosure  standards, \nregulatory  updates  and  enforcement,  supervision  and  surveillance,  and  sector \nefficiency.  \n\ntransparency,  complementary \n\nthe  Government  and \n\nfinancial \n\nVested  interests  may  slow  reform.  Resistance  to  the  reforms  by  vested \ninterests  could  delay  program  implementation  or  weaken  its  impact.  This  risk is \nconsidered  moderate  since  the  Government  has  so  far  shown  immense \ncommitment  by  pursuing  the  reform  agenda  under  FSP  I  and  recently  adopted \nthe  2001\u20132010  blueprint). \nthe  FSDS  2006\u20132015 \nInstitutionalizing  governance  reforms  in  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  is  likely  to  be  a \nlong process and the strategic approach of FSP II is to focus on supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s initiatives to (a) promote integrity in the regulation and supervision \nof  banks,  insurance  companies,  and  MFIs;  (b)  promote  transparency  in  the \ndecision-making  process  and  ensure  that  information  is  readily  available  to \nmarket participants who need to make informed decisions; and (c) strengthen the \ncapacity of the various supervisory financial institutions.  \n\n(updated  version  of \n\n \n(v)   Weak  institutional  and  human  capacity.  Risks  may  be  associated  with  weak \ninstitutional  and  human  capacity,  as  well  as  with  the  implementation  and \nenforcement  of  new  laws  and  regulations.  To  mitigate  those  risks,  training \nprograms  have  been  initiated  at  various  training  institutions  established  during \nFSP  I.  Subprogram  1  will  provide  financial  support  to  these  institutions  to  help \nupdate  their  curriculum.  Program  implementation  will  be  supported  by  an \nadvisory  TA  to  reduce  the  downside  risks  from  weak  capacity,  especially  in  the \nimplementation  of  new  concepts.  With  these  design  safeguards,  the  integrated \nbenefits and impact are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\nVII.   ASSURANCES \n\n \n75. \nIn addition to complying with and implementing the actions specified in the subprogram 1 \npolicy  matrix  and  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the loan agreement: \n \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  implementation  of  the  trigger  actions  set  out  in \nthe  medium-term  policy  framework  that  need  to  be  completed  to  enable \nprocessing of subprogram 2. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Government will (a) carry out the policies and actions in accordance with the \nschedule  of  policy  reforms  contained  in  the  medium-term  policy  framework  and \nas  described  in  the  development  policy  letter,  and  ensure  sustainability  of  the \nreforms  beyond  the  subprogram  1  period;  (b)  carry  out  all  of  its  obligations  as \nstipulated under the loan agreement in a timely manner; and (c) ensure that the \nagreed actions are taken with respect to each policy achievement.  \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government will keep ADB informed of, and will from time to time exchange \nviews  on,  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  subprogram  1.  Furthermore,  the \nGovernment  will  continue  timely  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on  problems  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27         \n\n \n\nconstraints,  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral \nand  bilateral  agencies \nimplementation  of \nsubprogram  1,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any \nresulting  policy  proposals.

The era was marked \nby  a  rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  joint  ventures,  locally  incorporated  family-owned  banks, \nbranches  of  foreign  banks,  and  state-owned  financial  institutions,  which  resulted  in  most \nfinancial  institutions  being  poorly  managed  and  almost  half  being  considered  technically \ninsolvent.  Supported  by  an  International  Monetary  Fund  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility \nthat  was  phased  out  in  2003,  the  banking  system  relicensing  program  (i)  introduced  a  legal \nframework  for  banks  and  financial  institutions;  (ii)  successfully  closed  all  nonviable  banks; \n(iii) relicensed  the  remaining  banks  under  strengthened  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC) \nsupervision  requirements;  and  (iv)  initiated  restructuring  and  privatization  of  the  major  state-\nowned foreign trade bank. Cambodia\u2019s financial sector remains shallow and fragile with limited \nfinancial intermediation and outreach. \n \n2. \nAt  present  the  formal  financial  system  comprises  NBC,  16  commercial  banks,  7 \nspecialized  financial  institutions,  and  2  representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks;  17 \nlicensed  and  26  registered  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs);  and  6  insurance  companies. \nCambodia has yet to establish bond or securities markets. The predominantly rural nature of the \neconomy,  high  transaction  costs,  inability  of  the  real  sector  to  put  together  bankable  projects, \nand low creditor confidence have been the main factors causing the low formal intermediation \nand outreach within the sector, slow development in nonbank financial institutions, and limited \nrange of products and services being offered. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  vision  for  the  financial  sector  is  for  a  sound,  market-based  system \n3. \nthat  will  enhance  resource  mobilization,  ensure  the  effective  allocation  of  financial  resources, \nand  contribute  to  broad-based  sustainable  economic  growth  as  embodied  in  the  Financial \nSector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS)  2006\u20132015.  The  FSDS  recognizes  that  for  equitable \ngrowth to occur, a diversified, competitive, but prudentially sound financial system would play an \nimportant  role  in  national  development  by  ensuring  efficient  accumulation  and  effective \nallocation of financial resources. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks, hence when \npursuing  financial  development,  a  focus  on  prudential  risk  management,  transparency,  and \nuniform application of rules and regulations is needed. \n \n4. \nDominated  by  the  banking  system,  the  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \nrestructuring  and  reforms  since  the  mid-1990s.  In  1996,  NBC  was  established  as  the  central \nbank following promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank \nof Cambodia. In 1999, the Government enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions \nenabling NBC to undertake a relicensing program that brought about the closure of 16 nonviable \nbanks  in  2002,  raised  capital  requirements  for  the  remaining  banks  to  $13  million  equivalent, \nand  set  the  minimum  capital  adequacy  requirement  at  15%  of  risk-weighted  assets.  The \nFinancial Sector Development Blueprint, formulated and adopted in 2001, provided a clear set \nof  objectives  and  a  sequenced  program  of  reforms  in  the  financial  sector.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  lead  development  partner  in  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to implement the blueprint to improve financial soundness and efficiency, \nrestore confidence, attract a broader base of high quality financial institutions, and broaden the \nsector\u2019s outreach within the blueprint framework. \n \nThe  economy  is  largely  cash-based  and  highly  dollarized.  Dollarization  emerged  in \n5. \nCambodia because public confidence in the local currency eroded following a series of shocks \nduring the conflict and financial mismanagement prior to 1989. In some instances dollarization \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nhas assisted development of the financial sector, but in other circumstances, dollarization limits \nthe  tools  the  Government  can  use  in  its  monetary  policies.  With  recent  improvements  in \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  measures  taken  by  the  authorities  to  restore  confidence  in \ninstitutions and in the banking system, public confidence is growing but slowly, and dollarization \nremains high. In the absence of reliable data, the amount of dollars and other foreign currencies \ncirculating in Cambodia cannot be verified. Thai baht and Vietnamese dong banknotes are also \nwidely used in some of the provinces bordering Thailand and Viet Nam. The cash nature of the \neconomy means that even major transactions are settled in cash outside of the banking system \nand paper trails are minimal.  \n \n6. \nThe private sector is characterized by a high degree of informality, and is dominated by \nthe  informal  sector.  Enterprises  that  have  enjoyed  years  of  operating  without  any  established \nrule  of  law  prefer  to  remain  informal.  The  tax  regime  is  still  very  open  to  negotiation  and  the \nmajority of participants in the real sector, especially in rural areas, are reluctant to enter into any \nform  of  formal  financial  transactions  for  fear  of  being  exposed  to  the  tax  authorities.  Private \nenterprises  are  generally  family  owned  with  no  separation  between  management  and  owners \nwho usually do not maintain proper records, including financial reports that can be considered \nreliable.  \n \n7. \nBanking System. No legal barriers are in place for the entry of foreign banks. At the end \nof  2006,  eight  commercial  banks  had  majority  foreign  ownership.  The  commercial  banking \nsubsector  now  consists  of  16  commercial  banks,  7  specialized  financial  institutions,  and  \n2  representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks.  Despite  the  increase  in  the  number  of  banks, \nhigh  transaction  costs  and  markups  remain  but  competition  is  starting  to  pick  up  with  some \nevidence of market segmentation emerging. With the exception of the Rural Development Bank, \nthe banking system is almost entirely owned by the private sector. Most banks have established \nbranches in other urban centers and are planning to open additional offices in those areas. Only \none bank branch is presently able to provide full banking services for every 120,000 citizens, but \nthis is clearly insufficient to meet the nation\u2019s needs.  \n \n8. \nTo date most branches are concentrated in large urban centers, but this is expected to \nchange. ACLEDA bank, a former MFI, currently has branches in every province and a total of 79 \nsites provide banking services. Canadia bank has 11 branches outside Phnom Penh, and three \nother banks have 4 branches outside Phnom Penh  including ANZ Royal bank with automated \nteller machines at each of its branches. In 2006, bank staff totaled more than 4,600, with one \nbank  (ACLEDA)  employing  3,028  and  other  banks  employing  between  20  and  250.  Technical \ncapacity  is  still  weak  and  most  banks  provide  their  own  in-house  training  to  complement  the \ntraining programs offered by the association of banks. \n \n9. \nCommercial  banking  is  relatively  small  but  growing  quickly,  with  the  more  aggressive \nand  progressive  banks  attaining  a  growth  rate  that  averaged  52%  credit  and  42%  deposit \ngrowth  in  2006.  The  number  of  commercial  bank  loans  doubled  from  December  2002  to  total \n164,000 at the end of 2006. If these loans were all to individual borrowers then it would be the \nequivalent  of  providing  loans  to  1.2%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population.  Total  banking  assets \nrepresented  about  29%  of  the  estimated  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2006.  The  banking \nsystem  is  fairly  concentrated  with  about  three  quarters  of  deposits  held  by  the  six  largest \ncommercial banks, which also account for about two thirds of total loans.   \n \nCommercial  banks  mainly  offer  simple  services  to  retail  and  corporate  customers  in \n10. \nurban areas (time and term deposits, savings accounts, basic loans, domestic and cross-border \nwire  transfers,  foreign  exchange,  letters  of  credit,  etc.).  Specialized  banks  are  not  allowed  by \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n34 \n \n \nlaw to accept deposits and commercial banks had about 285,000 depositors (more than 2% of \nthe total population) at the end of 2006. Most deposit products are short-term in nature and as a \nconsequence  loan  terms  are  also  short  (average  3  years)  with  high  interest  rates.  Banks \ncontinue to rely on physical collateral and personal guarantee as loan security. More advanced \nbanking services are being introduced such as electronic banking and private banking. During \n2006  alone,  69  ATMs  were  introduced,  raising  the  total  from  17  to  86.  Several  banks  have \nindicated that they plan to increase this number. \n \nThe  noncash  payment  system  is  very  small  and  of  limited  sophistication.  It  is \n11. \npredominantly  paper-based  and  manual.  NBC  runs  the  clearinghouse,  which  operates  in  both \nriels  and  dollars.  The  riel  clearinghouse  has  15  members  (NBC,  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance  [MEF],  and  13  banks)  and  the  dollar  clearinghouse  has  17  members  (NBC  and  16 \nbanks).  Average  daily  amounts  that  pass  through  the  clearinghouses  average  about  \n$5.5 million, of which riel clearances represent only around 5%. By volume, about 1,100 checks \nare  cleared  each  day,  of  which  around  95%  are  drawn  in  dollars.  The  first  clearance  is  at  \n9:30 a.m., with a second clearance at 3:00 p.m. to handle returns. Banks bring their balances to \nthe clearinghouse on diskette. Interbank settlement is by check drawn on the banks\u2019 accounts \nwith  NBC.  The  enactment  of  the  negotiable  instruments  and  payment  transactions  law  in  late \n2005  and  the  issuance  of  key  regulations  in  December  2006  provide  the  legal  framework  for \ndeveloping  the  payments  system,  introducing  new  negotiable  instruments,  and  promoting  the \ndevelopment of money and interbank markets. \n \n12. \nNBC\u2019s  principal  mission  is  to  formulate  and  implement  monetary  policy  aimed  at \nmaintaining  price  stability  and  economic  development.  Its  main  functions  are  to  (i)  act  as  the \nmonetary authority and conduct monetary policy (NBC has actively intervened in the riel foreign \nexchange market to deliver a stable exchange rate and ensure price stability in riel); (ii) act as \nthe  sole  issuer  of  the  national  currency  (as  such  NBC  has  increased  the  number  of  currency \ndenominations and replaced worn and dirty bank notes); (iii) act as the supervisory authority of \nthe  banking  and  financial  system;  (iv)  oversee  the  payments  system  in  Cambodia;  and  \n(v) manage the international reserves of the country.    \n \n13. \nThe banking supervision program and standards have greatly improved since 2001 and \nbeen  extended  to  cover  all  banks,  a  move  made  possible  with  the  addition  of  skilled  staff. \nPrudential supervision was enhanced with the adoption of the uniform chart of accounts by all \nbanks  in  2004,  and  the  same  banks  making  their  annual  audited  financial  statements  publicly \navailable since 2005. Several banks have published these annual audited financial statements \non  their  own  websites.  In  2006,  NBC  enhanced  its  regulatory/supervisory  system  by \nimplementing  an  off-site  supervision  system  known  as  the  Cambodian  Bank  Reporting  for \nPrompt  Corrective  Action.  The  system  enables  staff  to  perform  a  regular  analysis  of  off-site \nreports, and identify risks faced by banks and infringements caused by banks; and then for the \nstaff concerned to recommend immediate actions to NBC management. The development and \nimplementation of the system has been supported by a resident advisor from the International \nMonetary Fund. NBC continues to undertake on-site inspection of each bank once a year. \n \n14. \nBanking,  along  with  other  financial  and  commercial  subsectors,  continues  to  face  high \ntransaction  costs  attributable  to  the  lack  of  mechanisms  to  enforce  contracts  and  absence  of \nreliable information. The establishment of the credit information sharing system in 2006 should \nimprove  the  situation,  but  some  time  will  be  required  to  build  a  sufficient  database.  Dispute \nsettlement remains a major issue and if unresolved will continue to affect the degree of certainty \nassociated  with  financial  and  commercial  transactions.  Financial  sector  stakeholders  would \nundoubtedly welcome the operations of a commercial court and commercial arbitration center to \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nprovide a greater degree of certainty. \n \n15.  Microfinance  Subsector.  Microfinance  is  growing  rapidly  with  assets  expanding  at \naround  80%  in  2006,  with  some  institutions  expanding  at  200%  per  annum.  The  expansion  is \nallowing  microfinance  to  support  and  grow  the  economy,  especially  in  its  target  market  of  the \npoor and remote rural population. The microfinance subsector now comprises 17 licensed MFIs, \n26  registered  rural  credit  operations,  and  around  60  nongovernment  organizations  operating \nunrestricted  across  the  whole  country.  Registration  and  licensing  commenced  in  2002.  A \nnumber have transitioned from aid-focused nongovernment organizations to commercial MFIs; \nand  some  were  set  up  as  commercial,  profit-oriented  MFIs  from  the  outset.  Most  MFIs  have \nplans to continue rapid expansion with the establishment of additional branches and increased \nlending activities at existing branches. \n \n16.  MFIs  currently  have  around  400,000  clients  (about  2.9%  of  the  total  population)  with \nloans outstanding ranging in size from less than $75 to a maximum of $5,000, but this can go as \nhigh  as  $10,000.  The  expansion  in  net  number  of  loans  is  currently  around  10%  per  annum. \nVoluntary  savings  of  MFIs  are  very  small.  Licensed  MFIs  have  adopted  a  wide  range  of \nbusiness  models  with  good  corporate  governance  and  orderly  market  development  to  deliver \ntheir services and products. This was highlighted in 2006 when Cambodian MFIs won 4 of 20 \nfinancial  transparency  awards  presented  by  the  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor.  The \nestimate  in  the  1998  Cambodian  census  was  that  1,750,930  families  in  Cambodia  were  poor. \nWhile huge progress has been made with poverty reduction; an enormous portion of the poor \nand remote rural population still does not have access to effective financial services.   \n \n17.  MFIs,  while  growing  rapidly,  have  major  challenges  to  expanding  their  services. \nAddressing these issues should assist them to continue to grow in a sound manner. MFIs face \ncompetition from informal operators in their markets. The scale of this competition is anecdotally \nsaid to exceed the size of the formal financial sector but no reliable data is available to support \nthis view. A number of costs and challenges are imposed on the industry such as nonresident \nwithholding  tax,  lack  of  a  reliable  method  to  track  the  use  of  certificates  of  title  for  collateral \nbetween institutions, and extremely limited access to domestic funding sources. Growth brings \nits  own  challenges,  such  as  whether  management  is  able  to  maintain  control  over  business \nprocesses  when  the  scale  of  operations  begins  to  outstrip  the  capabilities  of  current  systems \nand  processes.  Foreign  borrowing  does  bring  growth  and  benefits  in  terms  of  improved \ngovernance  and  transparency,  but  at  the  same  time  foreign  borrowing  brings  growing  foreign \nexchange risk as institutions increase their lending in the riel-based rural areas. \n \n18.  Money  Changers.  In  addition  to  banks,  the  Law  on  Foreign  Exchange  (1997)  allows \nindividuals  and  legal  entities  to  undertake  foreign  exchange  transactions  if  they  register  with \nNBC.  They  are  not  allowed  to  undertake  any  other  financial  activity.  In  December  2006,  the \ncountry  had  647  registered  money  changers;  53  in  Phnom  Penh  and  594  in  the  provinces. \nStatistics on the transactions undertaken by money changers are not available. \n \n19. \nInsurance  Subsector.  The Department of Financial Industry within MEF is responsible \nfor prudential regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, which consists of one state-\nowned and four private nonlife insurance companies, and a reinsurance institution that is 80% \nstate-owned. The insurance industry is young and small. It has gone through a turbulent period \nbut  with  the  introduction  of  regulations  and  the  enforcement  of  those  regulations,  stability  and \ngrowth  has  returned.  The  regulator  requires  the  capital  of  each  company  to  be  distributed  as \nfollows:  10%  deposited  with  NBC,  50%  deposited  in  commercial  banks,  with  the  decision  on \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n36 \n \n \nhow to invest the 40% balance left to the insurance company concerned. Insurance companies \nhave indicated that they would like these ratios to be changed, and the 40% increased. \n \n20. \nGrowth has been steady (averaging 11%\u201313% in the last 3 years) from a limited range \nof  insurance  products;  the  total  gross  premiums  were  $12.5  million  at  the  end  of  2006.  The \nthree  nonlife  categories  of  insurance  products  (commercial  vehicles,  construction  sites,  and \npassenger  vehicle  liabilities)  underwritten  in  this  market  are  compulsory  by  regulation.  Growth \nhas been steady since 2003 with commercial fire and miscellaneous policies making up 47% of \nthe market, and motor vehicle insurance 19%. Other products sold include hospital and surgical, \npersonal  and  accident,  marine  cargo,  and  travelers  insurance.  The  insurance  companies \noperating in Cambodia are conservatively managed.   \n \nThe  insurance  industry  requires  a  number  of  specialist  skills  that  are  not  required  in \n21. \nother industries. As insurance is a fairly new concept in Cambodia, these specialist skills are not \navailable and need to be acquired (e.g., underwriters, actuaries, loss adjustors, fund managers). \nThe framework for insurance supervision has been developed but material deficiencies in terms \nof capacity for supervision remain.  \n \n22. \nCapital  Market.  Cambodia  has  no  bond  and  securities  markets.  The  Law  on \nGovernment  Securities  was  enacted  in  January  2007  and  the  non-government  securities  law \nwas  subsequently  adopted  by  the  National  Assembly  in  September  2007.  The  most  recent \nshort-term government securities were issued in 2005. The placement of government securities \nis  jointly  organized  by  NBC  and  the  commercial  banks.  The  Government  has  established  a \ncapital market unit in MEF and in April 2007 signed a memorandum of understanding with the \nstock exchange of the Republic of Korea for $1.8 million worth of technical assistance to help \nwith the initial training and preparation for the establishment of a securities market in the near \nfuture. \n \nAccounting  and  Auditing  Infrastructure.  The  continuing  growth  of  the  commercial \n23. \nsector is creating significant challenges to improve the quality of accounting and auditing, and to \nproduce  sufficient  numbers  of  qualified  accountants.  Cambodia  has  established  a  legal  and \nregulatory framework for accounting and auditing, but inconsistencies between the various laws \nand  regulations  remain  with  some  aspects  difficult  to  interpret  and  weakness  in  the  overall \nframework. Fifteen Cambodian accounting standards and 10 Cambodian accounting standards \nhave been introduced but are not consistent with international standards. A standards advisory \nbody and a local institute of accountants have been established to oversee this. \n \n24. \nThe accounting profession is in its infancy. The 11 public accounting and auditing firms \nemploy 30 resident qualified accountants, 10 of whom are locally qualified. Currently more than \n12,000 companies are registered and the rate of registration is growing. The public accounting \nfirms have few, if any, local clients. To date more than 1,000 students have enrolled in the local \naccounting  qualification  course,  but  approximately  40%  of  those  have  either  dropped  out  or \nbeen  dismissed.  Seventeen  students,  including  those  not  employed  in  public  accounting,  are \nqualified  certified  public  accountants  but  the  vast  majority  of  students  are  experiencing \ndifficulties completing the early stages of the course.  \n \n25. \nLegal  Infrastructure.  An  enabling  legal  framework  for  financial  and  commercial \ntransactions  could  be  achieved  by  continuing  support  for  Cambodia\u2019s  process  of  law  reform, \nincluding  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  core  financial  and  commercial  laws  that  are \nharmonized  and  aligned  with  the  legal  system.  The  law  reform  process  in  financial  and \ncommercial  areas  aims  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  the  financial  sector  and  for \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\neconomic growth in general. The Government has taken important steps to prepare, adopt, and \nimplement  certain  major  laws.  The  second  stage  of  development  is  for  additions  and \nrefinements to be made to the legal framework. \n \nThe  process  for  enacting  a  new  law  is  subject  to  several  documented  steps.  In  a \n26. \ncommon situation, where an international legal expert has provided assistance and produced a \ndraft document in English, the translation into Khmer would take a minimum of 2\u20133 weeks. Then \nthe  process  of  internal  debate  and  consultation  is  held  within  the  ministry  responsible  for \nintroducing the new law. Following these steps, the procedures pertaining to the passage of the \nlaw through the Council of Ministers and National Assembly are usually lengthy: approval by the \nCouncil  of  Ministers  usually  take  at  least  6  months  (but  usually  longer),  and  the  process  for \nsubmission  to  the  National  Assembly  and  the  approval  process  within  the  assembly  itself  is \nestimated to take approximately 1 year. As a consequence, delay is always a risk at any given \nstage of the legislative process. \n \n27. \nThe current court process for the enforcement of collateral is seen as lengthy, uncertain, \nand subject to delays, including the process for appeal. The current situation calls for an urgent \nstrengthening of Cambodia\u2019s dispute resolution system as it is a critical element of the emerging \nfinancial and commercial legal framework. The introduction of commercial arbitration under the \nnew Law on Commercial Arbitration will be a key mechanism to consistently enforce contracts \nand  fairly  resolve  commercial  disputes.  A  new  commercial  court  sponsored  by  the  United \nNations and other bilateral development partners, still in the planning stages, has the potential \nfor improving transparency and finality under clearly set court procedures. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n38 \n \n \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \nDevelop a sound, market-\nbased financial system to \nsupport resource \nmobilization and \nsustainable economic \ngrowth \n \n \n \n\nPurpose \n1.

The  staff  are  young,  with  little  experience,  and  need  extensive \ntraining  and  opportunities  to  gain  operational  experience  to  improve  their  effectiveness.  They \nwill need to establish relationships with commercial banks and other authorized users. \n \n2. \nThe  current  clearing  and  settlement  system  for  checks  is  effective  but  needs \nimprovements.  Improvement  could  be  made  by  having  the  clearing  performed  during \nnonbanking business hours at around 6:00 p.m. each business day. Dishonored checks would \nthen  be  presented  the  next  business  day  at  9:00  a.m.,  with  settlement  shortly  thereafter  and \ncompleted  no  later  than  10:00  a.m.  This  approach  would  allow  banks  to  provide  funds  to  the \nbeneficiary of a check payment the next business day by 10:00 a.m., 18\u201320 hours sooner than \ncurrently offered. If the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) does not wish to provide the clearing \nat  this  proposed  time,  then  the  banks  could  provide  the  clearing  at  some  designated  location \nand the return processing could be accommodated by 9:00 a.m. at NBC the next business day. \nTo determine if this is a feasible proposal and the impact on the banking community and their \ncustomer base, PPU should develop a policy paper outlining the many issues of concern; how \nthey might be resolved; and the impact on NBC, the banks, and bank customers.  \n \nIf  check  volumes  reach  the  point  where  some  banks  see  benefits  to  automating  their \n3. \nback  office  processes,  then  the  standardization  of  checks  used  in  Cambodia  could  be \nconsidered, along with the development of bank identification numbers. Section A (paras. 6\u20139) \nindicates the steps involved in making these changes. \n \n4. \nIn  many  countries,  the  evolution  of  the  noncash  retail  payment  system  is  left  to  the \nprivate  sector  to  manage  and  implement  with  the  central  bank  providing  only  settlement \nservices.  If  the  private  sector  in  Cambodia  prefers  that  NBC  perform  this  responsibility,  then \nperhaps  NBC  should  immediately  begin  developing  an  automatic  clearinghouse  for  electronic \npayments  following  the  steps  outlined  for  the  development  of  a  real  time  gross  settlement \n(RTGS)  system.  Otherwise,  NBC\u2019s  resources  should  be  directed  to  the  development  of  an \neffective means of handling large value transactions on a gross basis, either through the use of \nSWIFT1 as a communications system or through a fully electronic RTGS system. \n \n5. \nDevelopment of either a retail or wholesale payment system will take some time. Section \nB (paras. 10\u201332) outlines steps needed to identify a vendor that could provide an RTGS system. \nThe process would take from 24 to 36 months. A similar process would be required to develop \nan  automatic  clearinghouse  and  may  take  a  similar  amount  of  time,  although  it  could  be \naccomplished with a separate team and move forward concurrently if NBC is unwilling to leave \nthis to the private sector. \n \nA. \n \n6. \nthe following activities: \n \n\nPreparing  Position  Paper  on  Changing  Hours  of  the  Clearinghouse.

and \nthe  NBC  consultant  should  be  capable  of  developing  and  documenting  user \nrequirements,  building  consensus  among  NBC  staff  and  the  bankers,  preparing \nthe  RFP  for  the  system  under  appropriate  procurement  guidelines,  identifying  a \nlist of possible vendors to respond to the RFP, training and leading the evaluation \nteam,  assisting  in  evaluating  responses,  reviewing  the  final  vendors  and \ndocumenting as to why one should be selected over another, participating in the \nnegotiation of the contract, reviewing in-depth the vendor\u2019s solution with the user \nrequirements  and  identifying  areas  that  do  not  meet  the  requirements,  seeking \nsolutions  to  the  shortfall  in  requirements,  monitoring  implementation  of  the \nvendor\u2019s  product,  training  staff  in  the  operation  of  the  new  system,  training  and \neducating  bankers  and  other  users  in  the  functions  of  the  system,  assuring \nsuccessful  production  environment,  and  coordinating  with  senior  management \nand maintaining their confidence in the project. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nImplementing an RTGS System \n\nB.  \n \n10. \nInstalling  an  RTGS  system  in  the  most  effective  way  and  at  the  least  cost  requires \nseveral steps. Probably the most important is developing a user requirements document. This \ndocument  should  describe  the  detailed  needs  that  all  expect  the  system  to  meet.  It  should  be \ndeveloped  with  input  from  all  affected  areas  of  NBC  and  all  the  banks  to  be  connected  to  the \nsystem  to  ensure  the  various  reports  and  other  needs  are  achieved.  PPU  could  be  given  this \nresponsibility, perhaps with some outside help from a consultant. \n \n11. \nThe user requirements document should be divided into a number of sections, and cover \nin detail: data entry, data validation, data communications, data processing, data storage, data \npresentation,  security,  reliability,  and  planning  for  the  event  of  failure  of  some  system \ncomponent, or of the system in its entirety.  \n \n12. \nA  vision  of  what  the  system  would  perform  and  how  it  would  operate,  i.e.,  the  system \ndesign,  is  formulated  from  the  user  requirements.  The  design  of  an  RTGS  system  should  be \nguided  by  the  Core  Principles  for  Systemically  Important  Payment  Systems  developed  by  the \nBank  for  International  Settlements.  In  addition,  the  design  should  be  prepared  to  mitigate \npayment  system  risk,  including  credit,  legal,  liquidity,  operational,  systemic,  and  other  risks \nnormally covered by payment systems.  \n \n13. \nThe  user  requirements  document  provides  a  broad  overview  of  what  is  envisioned  for \nthe  system  and  its  objectives,  including  the  risks  that  need  to  be  mitigated.  Development  of  a \nuser  requirements  document  should  have  the  support  of  all  the  NBC  user  departments  and \nmove  forward  at  a  steady  pace.  Realistically,  it  would  take  4\u20138  months  to  effectively  develop \nand  review.  Banks  should  have  an  understanding  of  what  is  happening  and  the  requirements \nshould be shared with them for their views. \n\n \n1. \n\nData Entry \n\n \n14. \nThe data entry portion of the document outlines the information needed to process the \npayment instruction and to ensure that the receiving bank has sufficient information to post the \namounts  to  the  account  of  the  intended  beneficiary.  The  receiving  bank  could  accomplish  this \ntask either manually or electronically. Adopting the SWIFT format may be a good place to start \nand then ensure that these message formats meet the needs of the program participants. The \nformat may need to be customized for local issues that are unique to Cambodia. \n \n15. \nIn  addition,  the  SWIFT  format  would  identify  the  various  data  elements  needed  to \nconsummate the transaction. Setting up appropriate codes, such as uniform bank identification \ncodes,  customer  account  codes,  and  proper  formatting  principles,  is  important.  In  addition, \naccess  to  the  terminal  to  be  used  for  entering  the  basic  data  requires  some  form  of  control \nprocesses to prevent unauthorized transactions. \n \n\n2. \n\nData Validation \n\n \n16. \nData  must  be  entered  accurately.  Once  the  transaction  is  released  for  processing  and \nforwarded to the receiving bank, little or no time is available to catch an invalid transaction or a \ntransaction  with  erroneous  information.  The  sending  bank  is  totally  liable  and  their  data \nvalidation procedures should therefore be strong to prevent any mishap. One way of ensuring \nthis process is to divide duties so that the person who enters the original data does not validate \nit.  The  person  validating  should  reenter  selected  and  important  data  elements,  such  as  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n61 \n\nreceiving  bank  identification,  amount,  and  beneficiary  information.  The  computer  can  then \nvalidate  the  correctness  of  the  information.  If  accurate,  it  can  be  queued  for  release,  or  if  not \naccurate, returned to the data entry person for correction. One person to enter and correct the \ndata,  the  second  person  to  validate  and  release  the  transaction,  is  the  minimum  staffing \nrequired to enter and send transaction data at any point of entrance. The system should allow \nfor more people to be involved and to divide their duties, but prevent the person that enters data \nfrom validating and releasing the data. \n \n\n3. \n\nData Communication or Transmission \n\n \n17. \nOnce  the  data  is  entered  and  validated,  it  is  ready  for  release  into  the  system.  Once \nreleased,  no  human  intervention  should  occur  until  it  reaches  the  receiving  bank  unless  an \nunanticipated major problem occurs. The transaction should flow through the system until it is \ndelivered  to  the  receiving  bank,  and  possibly  even  to  the  beneficiary\u2019s  account,  depending  on \nthe capabilities available at the receiving bank in its delivery of information to customers. Some \nreceiving banks may elect to advise a customer electronically of the receipt of incoming funds. \n \n18. \nDuring the transmission process, the system should provide a high degree of reliability to \nensure  that  the  data  is  transmitted  accurately  and  the  error  correction  procedures  operated \ncorrectly in case part of the information is lost during transmission. This is a vendor issue, but \nmust be understood by the technical staff who will be part of the evaluation team. The vendor \nshould  identify  the  approaches  taken  to  ensure  integrity  of  the  data  being  sent  and  received, \nand  how  that  integrity  is  validated.  Encryption  is  very  important  to  ensure  that  data  retains  its \nintegrity,  and  is  not  viewed  by  unauthorized  persons  during  the  transmission  process. \nAuthentication processes help to automatically validate the identity of the sending bank for the \nreceiving banks. \n \n\nData Processing \n\n4. \n \n \n19. \nProcessing  of  the  data  received  basically  involves  debiting  the  current  account  of  the \nsending bank at NBC and simultaneously crediting the current account of the receiving bank at \nNBC. Most of the time, this will be very simple. However, before the transaction is posted, the \nsystem  must  confirm  the  information  in  the  transaction  is  accurate  and  valid  for  use  at  NBC. \nFurther, some form of authentication is required to confirm that the information came from the \nsending bank that wants its account debited.  \n \nOnce NBC is satisfied (based on the criteria programmed into the system), posting may \n20. \noccur.  If  funds  in  the  sending  bank's  settlement  account  at  NBC  are  not  sufficient,  then  a \nnumber  of  options  arise.  One  approach  is  to  outright  reject  the  transaction  and  return  it  as \nunprocessed  to  the  sending  bank.  Another  option  is  to  queue  the  transaction  for  up  to  30 \nminutes  or  until  the  sending  bank  receives  sufficient  funds  from  another  source.  Still  another \npossibility  is  to  have  a  predetermined  line  of  credit  with  sufficient  collateral  to  allow  the \ntransaction  to  move  forward.  Liquidity  management  would  become  easier  if  NBC  decided  to \ncentralize  all  operations  and  bank  account  balances  at  head  office  and  not  have  any \ncommercial  bank  account  balances  in  the  NBC  branch  offices.  These  approaches  are \nreasonable and simple to implement. Other more sophisticated approaches are costly. The user \nrequirements document must indicate the various approaches that NBC is willing to support to \nhelp  with  liquidity  management  at  the  sending  bank.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  any  unprocessed \ntransactions would be returned to the sending bank for resubmission at a later time.  \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n5. \n\nData Storage \n\n \n \n21. \nAll transactions are stored in the system for some reasonable time to provide for online \nretrieval  in  the  case  of  disputes  or  other  information  and  historical  statistical  needs.  The \ndatabase  should  have  robust  retrieval  features  and  storage  sufficient  to  enable  the  system  to \nretain  at  least  6  months  of  transactions.  This  would  also  allow  for  retrieval  of  information  for \nanalysis in determine activities in the payment system on a national basis. Storing data on an \nencrypted  basis  helps  retain  the  integrity  of  the  data  over  longer  periods,  and  prevents \nunauthorized  users  from  understanding  the  data  should  they  suddenly  find  that  they  have \naccess to such files. \n \n\n6. \n\nData Presentation \n\n \n22. \nPresenting the transaction to the receiving bank is in some ways the most important part \nof  the  process.  Probably  this  will  be  in  the  SWIFT  message  format,  which  is  widely  used \ninternationally for large value transactions. Also, reports at NBC need to be identified for posting \nto settlement accounts at the end of the day, and for audit trail purposes. Further, end of month \nreports will need to be identified, along with the data that is to be captured, analyzed, and saved \nfor  future  use.  Needs  of  the  various  users  should  be  defined  as  well  as  how  the  information \ntechnology infrastructure will be used to forward the various reports to the users. Interfacing to \nstand-alone  systems  for  other  analytical  purposes  will  require  definition  for  forwarding  the \nappropriate data.  \n \n\n7. \n\nSecurity and Access Control \n\n \n23. \nControlling who is to use the system is vitally important. Most systems are able to deny \naccess  to  unauthorized  users  through  the  use  of  user  identification  (user-id)  and  a  personal \nidentification number (PIN). The system can also dictate the frequency at which the PIN should \nbe  changed  for  each  user,  and  ensure  that  the  user  actually  changes  the  PIN.  However, \nmanagement  at  all  locations  (NBC  and  the  authorized  users)  must  ensure  that  the  user-id  is \ncurrent and that the user-ids of employees who no longer have a need to access the system are \nremoved on a timely basis. \n \n\nReliability \n\n8. \n \n \n24. \nAll  critical  components  of  the  system  must  work  throughout  the  processing  day. \nFrequently,  some  redundancy  of  equipment  is  required  to  ensure  high  reliability  for  each \noperating  day.  Also,  spare  parts  for  some  components  may  be  needed  to  ensure  users  have \naccess  and  the  system  is  able  to  provide  service  under  a  wide  variety  of  situations.  This \nincludes backup electrical power, filters to ensure no electrical power interruption for equipment \nand air conditioning units, alternate data communication lines (e.g., dial backup is a possibility) \nand  terminals,  and  appropriate  staff  resources.  In  some  cases  when  an  authorized  user\u2019s \nterminal  is  malfunctioning,  NBC  should  have  one  or  two  standby  terminals  that  can  be \nconfigured so that a user may come to NBC and enter their daily transactions directly. \n \n\nBusiness Continuity \n\n9. \n \n \n25. \nThis area concerns the service that will be provided should a situation arise where the \nmain  NBC  site  is  closed  because  of  some  catastrophic  event  that  was  not  foreseen  or  is \nuncontrollable.  While  these  events  are  of  low  probability,  they  do  occur  from  time  to  time. \nPerhaps in Cambodia, fire, severe water damage, or an extensive loss of electrical power might \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n63 \n\nbe the most likely events that could disrupt an RTGS system. A remote backup site, generally a \ngood distance from the primary site, is the usual solution to overcome this risk. For operational \npurposes,  some  staff  may  have  to  be  relocated,  while  in  other  situations  useful  work  can  be \naccomplished  at  the  remote  site  to  support  the  need  for  off-site  operating  staff.  Since \ntransactions are recorded on a real-time basis at the backup site throughout the operating day, \nputting a backup site into operation needs to be rapid and the communication infrastructure is \ncritical. \n \nAn  effective  backup  site  requires  appropriately  trained  staff  available  at,  or  able  to  go \n26. \nquickly, under any conditions, to the backup site; and sufficient data communication capability \nso that the system can operate from the backup site with the same degree of effectiveness and \nintegrity as from the primary site. \n \n\n10. \n\nTender Development  \n\n \n27. \nOnce the user requirements are documented and all the identified issues addressed and \ndocumented,  then  an  RFP  can  be  developed  and  forwarded  to  possible  vendors.  Much  basic \ninformation is required for normal acquisition processes. This information will be part of NBC\u2019s \nnormal  procurement  process  (and  the  requirements  of  any  donor  or  lending  organization  that \nmay be involved in helping NBC install such a system). It should also include the criteria to be \nused  to  evaluate  the  responses  and  the  weight  applied  to  each  criterion.  Vendors  should  be \ngiven from 30 to 60 days to respond to an RFP with the longer times given for the more complex \napproaches.  An  RTGS  system  is  considered  complex,  and  generally  the  more  time  given  for \ndeveloping the response the better the reply. Once the tender is released, an evaluation team \nneeds  to  be  organized  and  understand  the  criteria  for  the  selection  process.  Their  availability \nwill become critical once the responses are received, usually on the last possible day for receipt, \nto  perform  the  evaluation  to  help  with  vendor  selection  (paras.  28\u201330).  Members  of  the  team \nshould  represent  various  NBC  departments  (information  technology,  accounting,  banking \noperations, and PPU at a minimum), and perhaps one or two knowledgeable commercial bank \nrepresentatives with experience in payment systems and bank operations. \n \n\n11. \n\nVendor Selection \n\n \n28. \nAfter  the  responses  are  received,  the  evaluation  team  needs  to  review  each  response \nand  analyze  the  various  criteria.  Each  member  of  the  team  should  evaluate  each  response \nindependently and come to a conclusion for each responder based on the criteria. Each criterion \nwill  have  a  separate  weight  for  rating  agreed  to  in  advance.  Cost  should  carry  a  low  weight, \nwhile functionality and the ability to meet the user requirements should have one of the highest \nratings.  Once  this  process  is  complete,  one  person,  perhaps  a  consultant,  will  take  all  the \nevaluations  and  analyze  them  to  identify  the  three  best  vendor  solutions  requiring  detailed \nanalysis (i.e., a short list). The analyst should review the reasons used to justify why the three \nvendors were short-listed for further review.  \n \n29. \nThese  vendors  should  be  invited  to  make  a  formal  presentation,  or  visited,  to  better \nunderstand their approach (one method should be selected, not a mixture of the two.) The entire \nevaluation process needs to be objective, and must be performed in an ethical manner with no \nedge given to one vendor over another. Once the vendors have been reviewed, the evaluation \nteam will provide a recommendation that must be supported by a written evaluation as to why \nthe  selected  vendor  is  the  best  of  the  three.  The  recommendation  will  be  forwarded  to  NBC \nmanagement for approval and for subsequent contract negotiation prior to moving forward with \nother elements of the project.  \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nThis process, from the development of user requirements through the preparation of the \n30. \nRFP,  to  the  vendor  selection,  may  take  from  12  to  more  than  18  months  depending  on  the \nabilities of PPU, other NBC departments, consultants, and others involved in the process. \n \n\n12.  Management Approval \n\nthe  detail  of \n\n \nThis process may take a short or long time, depending upon the interest of management \n31. \nand \nthe \nrecommendation. Management should not be involved in the selection process, nor have direct \ncontact with any of the vendors being considered for the project during the selection process. \n \n\nthe  presentation.  Management  should  either  accept  or  reject \n\n13. \n\nContract Negotiations and Design Evaluation \n\n \n32. \nOnce  management  approval  is  given  to  move  forward  with  the  selected  vendor,  time \nmust  be  taken  to  ensure  that  all  parties  understand  the  intent  of  the  other.  The  vendor  has  a \nproduct  to  sell  and  the  acquirer  wants  to  assure  that  the  product  will  meet  their  needs  to  the \nfullest extent possible. At this time the acquirer has the most leverage over the vendor to ensure \nthat all elements of the project will be met. In a later mode, the technicians will need to ensure \nthat  the  system  design  will  meet  the  user  requirements  and  understand  how  the  vendor  will \nachieve those results. During both situations, an opportunity should be provided for both parties \nto  cede  from  the  project  and  for  NBC  to  possibly  select  another  vendor.  For  this  reason, \npotentially unsuccessful vendors should not be notified of the situation until a contract has been \nagreed to by all parties. \n\n\f \n\n            Appendix 6 \n\n65         \n\n \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\nLoan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  currency  expenditures  for the  reasonable cost  of \n\n1. \nimported goods required during the second Financial Sector Program Cluster (FSPL II). \n \n2. \n \n\nNo withdrawals will be made for the following: \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  groups  or  sub-groups  of  the \nUnited  Nations  Standard  International  Trade  Classification,  Revision  3  (SITC, \nRev.  3)  or  any  successor  groups  or  sub-groups  under  future  revisions  to  the \nSITC, as designated by ADB by notice to the Borrower: \n\nChapter  Heading \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A6: Ineligible Items \n \n\nSource: United Nations. \n \n(ii) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n718.7 \n\n728.43 \n897.3 \n\nAlcoholic beverages \nTobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \nTobacco, manufactured (whether or not containing tobacco \nsubstitute \nRadioactive and associated materials \nPearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or worked \nNuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \nTobacco processing machinery \nJewelry of gold, silver or platinum-group metals (except watches \nand watch cases) and goldsmiths\u2019 or silversmiths\u2019 wares \n(including set gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \n\nexpenditures  in  the  currency  of  the  Borrower  or  of  goods  supplied  from  the \nterritory of the Borrower; \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational  financing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  has  agreed  to \nfinance, including any contract financed under any loan or grant from the ADB; \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  intended  for  a  military  or  paramilitary  purpose  or  for \nluxury consumption; \n\nexpenditures for narcotics; and \n\nexpenditures  for  environmentally  hazardous  goods,  the  manufacture,  use  or \nimport  of  which  is  prohibited  under  the  laws  of  the  Borrower  or  international \nagreements to which the Borrower is a party; and \n\nexpenditures  on  account  of  any  payment  prohibited  by  the  Borrower  in \ncompliance  with  a  decision  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  taken  under \nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n525 \n667 \n718 \n\n728 \n897 \n\n971 \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nA. \n\nPurpose and Outputs \n\nFSP II IMPLEMENTATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe primary purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to help the Government improve \n1. \nthe capacity of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), which is the Executing Agency, and the \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  and  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  which  are  the \nimplementing agencies, to design and implement key reforms in the financial sector as well as \nto  provide  the  Government  with  timely  policy  advice  on  a  demand  basis.

NBC, MEF, and MOC will provide the necessary office space, counterpart staff, and \nother  support  services  to  the  consultants;  and  closely  coordinate  with  other  stakeholders \ninvolved in TA implementation.  \n \n7. \nThe  TA  will  require  a  total  of  89  person-months  of  consulting  inputs  comprising \n65 international and 24 national person-months. Experience in Cambodia has shown that firms, \nas opposed to individual consultants, have been more expensive and have not been successful \nin  recruiting  the  right  mix  of  consultants,  especially  when  the  project  requires  a  diverse  set  of \nexpertise. Because of the varying nature of expertise, the consultants will be engaged by ADB \non  an  individual  basis in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines on  the  Use of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Detailed  terms  of  reference  will  be  prepared  to  accompany  the \nnoncommittal inquiry. \n \n8. \nThe  consultants,  in  coordination  with  the  TA  Project  Management  Specialist,  will \nproduce inception, interim, and draft final reports for each component. The inception report will \nbe submitted within 3 weeks of the start of services and will contain a time-bound work plan of \nactivities  and  deliverables,  based  on  the  agreed  terms  of  reference.  The  interim  report  will  be \nsubmitted  half-way  through  the  contract,  and  the  draft  final  report  at  least  3  weeks  before \ncompletion  of  the  assignment.  Tripartite  meetings  will  be  held  to  review  the  draft  final  reports. \nThe final report, incorporating comments of the executing and implementing agencies and ADB, \nshould be submitted upon completion of the services. The TA is scheduled to commence by 1 \nMarch 2008 and be completed by 28 February 2010. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority  in  country  poverty  partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \nA. \n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nThe  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  (FSP  II)  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  continued  efforts  to  strengthen  the \nfinancial  sector  via  a  combination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity  building,  improved  disclosure \nstandards and financial transparency, and establishment of key financial infrastructure. By promoting the development \nof  a  sound,  market-based  financial  system  to  enhance  the  potential  for  economic  growth  and  the  creation  of \nemployment opportunities, FSP II will be pivotal in improving financial intermediation in Cambodia. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help reduce \npoverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic activities, and extending the outreach \nof  the  formal  financial  sector  to  poor  and  rural  areas.  An  efficient  financial  system  will  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  foreign  direct  investment.  Beneficiaries  are  expected  to  include  the  poor  and  near-poor.  A  robust \nfinancial  sector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable  exogenous  shocks  that  are  becoming  more  common  in \nincreasingly global financial markets, which have serious implications for the poor. \n \n \nB.
