The  two  related  loans  will  assist  the  Government  in\nimproving the quality and relevance of technical education and skills\ndevelopment (TESD) in the public and private sectors.\n\nA. TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nBorrower\n\nRepublic of the Philippines\n\nProject Description\n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nThe Project will assist the Government in  (i)  strengthening  the  role\nand  capacity  of  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development\nAuthority  (TESDA),  (ii)  devolving  TESDA\u2019s  responsibilities  for  training\ninstitutions  to  local  government  units  (LGUs),  (iii)  strengthening  the\ncapacity of the private providers of TESD, and (iv) enhancing equity in\nskills acquisition among the poor. To effect these changes, the Project\nwill  prepare  TESDA-administered  institutions  for  devolution,  and\nupgrade  the  curricula,  delivery  systems,  and  facilities  of  about  25\npublic TESD institutions and 45 provincial training centers.\n\nThe Project will institutionalize quality assurance programs in public\nand private institutions. To enhance access to TESD programs the\nProject will establish a scholarship fund and a student loan fund for\nthe  poor.  The  Project  will  strengthen  technical,  pedagogical,  and\nmanagement training at the school and local levels.\n\nPrimary:  human development\nSecondary:  poverty reduction\n\nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\n\nIn  the  Medium-Term  Philippines  Development  Plan,  the  Government\nemphasizes \u201ceconomic growth with social equity\u201d and the importance of\nthe private sector in \u201cenhancing industrial competitiveness\u201d in the global\neconomy.  This  policy  calls  for  the  development  of  a  highly  skilled\nworkforce  that  could  contribute  to  the  economy  to  enhance  its\ncompetetiveness in international markets. To meet these requirements,\nthe  TESD  system,  as  the  main  provider  of  technicians  and  skilled\nworkers,  must  be  responsive  to  rapidly  changing  technology  and  the\ndemands  of  industry.  TESD  programs  must  be  flexible,  industry-\noriented, and demand-driven. The present TESD system with its supply-\ndriven  orientation,  outdated  curricula,  poor  facilities,  and  inadequate\nteaching  equipment  cannot  effectively  produce  the  skilled  workforce\nrequired  by  the  economy.  Promoting  \u201csocial  equity\u201d  requires  that  the\npoor  have  wider  access  to  services,  including  better  opportunities  for\n\n\fObjectives\nand Scope\n\nii\n\ntraining  and  employment  with  necessary  support.  ADB\u2019s\nskills \nintervention  through  the  Project  will  help  upgrade  the  quality  and\nrelevance of TESD programs in the public and private sectors, provide\nfinancial support through scholarships  and  loans  to  the poor  to  enable\nfinding\nthem  to  acquire  employable  skills,  and  assist  them \nemployment. The Project will assist the Government in strengthening the\nmanagement capacity of the TESD system. TESDA, the main regulatory\nbody for the TESD subsector, will divest itself of responsibilities for the\nprovision of training and will be strengthened to focus on its function as\nan oversight agency.\n\nin \n\nThe main objective is to enhance the competitiveness of the Philippines\nthrough the improved quality and relevance of its TESD system and to\nenable TESDA to perform its function  more effectively as an oversight\nagency to better respond to  market demand for  highly skilled  workers.\nThe  secondary  objective  is  to  help  reduce  poverty  through  enhanced\nequity  to  TESD  programs  for  the  poor,  with  financial  support  and\nservices  to  enable  them  to  acquire  employable  skills  and  gainful\nemployment.\n\nThe Project has four  components:  (i) strengthening the  central  training\nagency  (TESDA),  (ii)  devolving  training  functions  to  local  institutions,\n(iii) strengthening  the  capacity  of  private  providers  of  TESD,  and\n(iv) enhancing  equity  in  skills  acquisition  among  the  poor.  Under\ncomponent (ii), 25 public schools and centers and 45 provincial training\ncenters  will  be  upgraded  in  preparation  for  devolution.  Through\ncomponent  (iii), the Project will help  improve the quality of  240 private\nTESD institutions. The Project will institutionalize quality assurance and\naccreditation  systems,  occupational  standards,  equivalency  and\ncertification systems, skills testing  systems, career  counseling, and  job\nplacement  programs  and  services.  Under  component  (iv),  the  Project\nwill provide the poor with scholarships and loans in TESD programs in\nprivate and public institutions.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe estimated total cost of  the Project  is $70  million equivalent, of\nwhich $27.34 million (39.1 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and\n$42.66 million equivalent (60.9 percent) is the local currency cost.\n\nFinancing Plan                                                                                                ($ million)\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\nADB\nNordic Development Fund\nOPEC Fund\nDANIDA\nGovernment of the\nPhilippines\nTotal\n\n0\n27.34\nDANIDA \u2013 Danish Agency for International Development\n\n9.34\n8.00\n0\n10.00\n\n15.66\n0\n7.00\n0\n\n20.00\n42.66\n\n25.00\n8.00\n7.00\n10.00\n\n20.00\n70.00\n\n35.7\n11.4\n10.0\n14.3\n\n28.6\n100.0\n\n\fiii\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nADB will provide a loan of $25 million from its ordinary capital resources\n(OCR)  to  finance  34.2 percent  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and  36.7\npercent of local currency costs.

International competitive\nbidding procedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost the\nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  more.  Supply  contracts    valued  at  less  than\n$500,000 equivalent will follow international shopping procedures, except that\nsupply  contracts  with  a  value  of  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be\nprocured by direct purchase. Civil works contracts to be financed 100 percent\nby  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  for\nInternational  Development  are  expected  to  be  small  and  local  competitive\nbidding procedures will be applied.\n\nConsulting Services A  total  of  176  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided\ncomprising  of  65  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and\n111 person-months  of  domestic  consultants  to  support  TESDA  in\nprogram development and institutional capacity building.

FUND FOR TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT\n\nBorrower\n\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP)\n\nProject Description\n\nEnrollments in private TESD institutions represent approximately 80 percent\nof the total number of students in the TESD subsector. As part of component\n(iii) of the TESDP, ADB will provide a loan of Y2,166,700,000 to DBP to set\nup and manage the FTESD. DBP will provide subloans to private institutions\nnationwide to upgrade the quality of their TESD programs. DBP will monitor\n\n\fiv\n\nthe use of the loan funds  to ensure that the borrowing institutions follow the\nprocedures and  requirements  of the  FTESD.  In  a  preliminary  survey  of  the\nprivate  institutions,  more  than  150  indicated  interest  in  borrowing  from  the\nFTESD with  loan amounts  ranging from $25,000  to  $500,000.  The  majority\nwant  to  borrow between $75,000  and  $250,000.  Approximately  120  private\nschools are expected to  benefit from the FTESD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe total cost of the FTESD is Y2,166,700,000, of which Y1,516,690,000 (70\npercent) is the estimated foreign exchange  cost for purchase of equipment,\ninstructional materials, and books, and Y650,010,000 (30 percent) is the local\ncurrency cost.\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nADB will provide a loan in the amount of Y2,166,700,000 through the market-\nbased  loan  window.  The  loan  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  15  years,\nincluding a grace period of 5 years and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent\nper annum. It will have a fixed interest rate for the first ten years, with an option\nto convert to a floating rate on the tenth year. DBP will pay to ADB a front-end\nfee  in  an  amount  equal  to  one  percent  of  the  loan  amount.  The  fee  will  be\ncapitalized in the loan.\n\nDBP  will  provide  subloans  to  eligible  private  providers  of  TESD  at  80\npercent  of  the  total  project  cost  from  ADB  loan,  with  the  borrower\ncontributing  the  remaining  20 percent  in  the  form  of  equity  participation.\nThe loan will have a maximum period of 10 years with a grace period of 6-\n24 months. The indicative interest rate as approved by the Department of\nFinance  is  11.5-14  percent  plus  a  front-end  fee  of  1  percent  and\ncommitment  fee  of  0.75 percent  per  annum  to  be  charged  on  the\nundisbursed  portion  of  the  loan.  The  minimum  and  maximum  subloan\namounts will be the equivalent of $25,000 and $1,000,000, respectively.\n\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2006\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nDBP  will  assign  a  team  of  qualified  staff  at  its  headquarters  to  manage  the\nFTESD. Eligible borrowers can apply for a loan at any DBP lending outlet.\n\nProcurement\n\nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  following    the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. In procuring goods and services to be financed by\nsubloans from  the  FTESD,  the borrowers  will be free  to use  the appropriate\nprocurement  procedures  subject  to  efficiency,  technical  acceptability,  and\nreliability of the services and goods and provided that the goods and services\nare supplied from and produced in ADB member countries.\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\nThrough the two loans, the Project will improve the quality and relevance of the\nTESD programs, which in turn will produce a better-trained workforce to meet\nthe emerging demands of business and industry. The institutional capacity of\nTESDA, LGUs, and TESD institutions will be strengthened in preparation for\nand support of the devolution of public institutions to LGUs and other agencies.\n\n\fv\n\nPrivate TESD institutions will be able to offer high-quality programs that meet\nnational accreditation standards.\n\nThrough  the  Scholarship  Fund  and  the  Student  Loan  Fund,  the  Project  will\nexpand opportunities and enhance access to quality TESD programs among\nthe  poor.  The  Project  will  enhance  employment  opportunities  for  TESD\ngraduates  through high-quality  instruction and  more  relevant  curricula,  better\nthe  private  sector,  and\nrelationships  between  TESD \nstrengthened career counseling and job placement support services provided\nby the project institutions.\n\ninstitutions  and \n\nAltogether  175,000  students  and  trainees  who  will  attend  the  targeted\n240 private  schools,  25  centers  of  excellence,  and  45  provincial  training\ncenters will benefit from the Project. The direct beneficiaries are approximately\n25,000  scholarship  awardees  and  loan  recipients.  Approximately  8,650\nteachers, supervisors, and administrators from the public  and private  sectors\nwill improve their knowledge and skills required to implement the new curricula.\nUltimately, the economy and industries will benefit from the expanded pool of\nhighly skilled TESD graduates.\n\nThe  number  of  poor  people  who  will  receive  direct  benefits  are  the  25,000\nscholarship awardees and loan recipients, of whom about half will be women.\nIn addition, approximately 95,000 poor TESD students enrolled in the project\npublic and  private  TESD  institutions  will  benefit  from  the  improved  curricula,\nbetter TESD programs, and updated instructional materials. Of these about 40\npercent or 38,000 will be women. Hence, of the total 175,000 students who will\nbenefit from the Project, approximately 50,000 will be women.\n\nA technical assistance (TA) grant of $775,000 for Strengthening Management\nCapacity  and  Improving  Quality  of  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills\nDevelopment  System  will  be  provided \nin\nstrengthening  management  capacity  and  improving  the  quality  of  the  TESD\nsystem.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Asian  Currency\nCrisis  Support  Facility,  provided  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  TA  will\nrequire  50 person-months  of  consulting  services:  16   international  and  34\ndomestic.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\nthe  Government \n\nto  assist \n\nTechnical\nAssistance\n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development\nProject,  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  to  the  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Fund  for\nTechnical Education and Skills Development, and (iii) the proposed administration by ADB of a\nloan  for  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries\n(OPEC)  Fund  for  International  Development.  The  Report  also  describes  proposed  technical\nassistance  for  Strengthening  Management  Capacity  and  Improving  Quality  of  the  Technical\nEducation  and  Skills  Development  System,  and  if  the  proposed  loans  are  approved  by  the\nBoard, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall  approve  the  technical\nassistance.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn its efforts to improve its global competitiveness, the Philippines has placed emphasis\non developing a highly skilled workforce through its technical education and skills development\n(TESD)  system  (Appendix  A).  This  calls  for  much  greater  attention  to  and  investment  in\nvocational and technical education. In response to the Government\u2019s request, in 1996 the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare a Technical Education\nand Skills Development Project. The TA was completed on 15 October 1998. In early 1999, the\nADB-funded  Philippines  Education  Sector  Study2  (PESS)  was  completed.  It  included  a\ncomprehensive  review  of  the  education  and  training  system.  The  final  report  stressed  the\nimportance  of  the  skills  development  system  in  strengthening  the  overall  competitiveness  of\nPhilippine industry. The key findings emphasized the important role played by the private sector\nand the need to improve access to skills training for the disadvantaged groups.\n\n3.\nAn Appraisal Mission was fielded from 15 November to 3 December 1999 to review and\nfinalize the technical, financial, institutional, and social aspects of the Project. Discussions with\nthe  three  cofinanciers\u2014Nordic  Development  Fund,  Danish  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  and\nOPEC  Fund  for  International  Development\u2014continued  after  appraisal  until  agreement  was\nreached  in  May  2000.  Throughout  project  preparation,  there  was  close  consultation  and\ncoordination with government officials and representatives of private TESD providers at central,\nprovincial,  and  school  levels,  as  well as  with  students,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),\ngraduates,  and  business  and  industry  representatives.  The  project  framework  is  given  in\nAppendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Philippines faces two overarching issues in the early 21st century. It must find ways\n4.\nto  continue and  accelerate  its global  competitiveness  and  it  must  achieve  major  reductions  in\npoverty.\n\n                                               \n1  TA 2627-PHI: Second Technical and Vocational Education Project, for $480,000, approved on 16 August 1996.\n2  Asian Development Bank and World Bank. 1999. Philippine Education for the 21st Century: The 1998 Philippines\nEducation Sector Study  Technical  Background  Paper  No.  4:  Technical-Vocational  Education  and  Training  in  the\nPhilippines.\n\n\f2\n\n1.\n\nCompetitiveness and the Labor Force3\n\n5.\nThe competitiveness of Philippine manufacturing in global markets is centrally important\nto  continued  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  As  noted  in  The  Philippine  National\nDevelopment  Plan:  Directions  for  the  21st  Century,4  economic  growth  and  modernization  can\naccelerate  much  faster  when  there  is  sufficient  access  to  the  world\u2019s  markets,  resources  and\nknow-how. However, if industry remains inefficient and uncompetitive, liberalization may lead to\na  net  income  loss  and a  widening  of  the gap between  rich and poor. Accordingly,  the  goal  of\nmeeting the challenges of globalization has been coupled with the goal of reducing poverty and\ninequality.\n\nThe comparative advantage of the Philippines in the future lies not in unskilled labor, but\n6.\nrather \nlow-end  \u201chigh-tech\u201d  areas  such  as  electronics  manufacturing  and  software\nin \ndevelopment. Data show high growth rates in exports of products requiring skilled labor and  a\nvery low growth or stagnation of those based on unskilled labor. There has been a sharp decline\nin  resource-based  manufactures, a  steady decline  in  labor-intensive  products,  and  a  dramatic\nincrease  in  science-based  goods,  including  those  that  are  technologically  complex.  For\nexample, the Philippines is now the second largest exporter of software in Asia after India. The\nworld market for software exports is vast and growing.5\n\n7.\nThe  Philippines  is  competitive  in  skill-intensive  products  because  of  a  relatively  large\neducated and trainable workforce. The country has considerable headroom for further growth in\nvalue-added  manufactured products  owing  to  the  strong  world demand for  such  products,  the\ncurrent  small  market  share,  and  lack  of  vulnerability  to  easy  entry  by  low-wage  producers.\nConsiderable scope also exists for upgrading production facilities and the skills of the workforce.\nHowever,  the  base  of  growth  remains  narrow  and  the  high  degree  of  export  concentration  is\ncause  for  concern.  The  export-oriented  sector  has  relatively  shallow  roots  in  the  domestic\neconomy,  with  low  local  content  and few  technological  linkages.  In  strengthening  these  roots,\nthe  Philippines  should adopt policies to  ensure  technological and  skills upgrading6  and aim  to\nincrease the value added of its products. This strategy has major implications for TESD. Raising\nproductivity, essential for improved competitiveness, depends largely on improving the quality of\neducation and training at postbasic levels.7\n\n8.\nThe  Philippines  faces  substantial  challenges  to  successfully  compete  in  the  world\nmarket.  Sustained  growth  in  the  global  markets  will  require  deepening  of  the  technological\ncompetence  of  enterprises and  workers.  Increases  in  skills  and  productivity  of  the  labor  force\nare  necessary  to  increase  the  quality  and  value  of  output  without  raising  labor  costs  beyond\ncompetitive levels. Higher productivity also leads to better earnings that enable workers to share\nin the benefits of growth.\n\n9.\nAlthough the Philippines has a relatively well-educated workforce, only a small minority\nof the  labor force have had  relevant  skills training.  As the  ADB  Country  Operational Strategy8\n\n                                               \n3 The following section is based in part on the PESS report.\n4  Government  of  the  Philippines  1998.

This is clearly\ninadequate  as  a  basis  for  maintaining  and  improving  competitiveness.  To  be  competitive  in\nworld  markets,  the  Philippines  needs  to  continuously  improve  the  skills  and  productivity  of  its\nworkforce.  Labor  productivity  depends  on  many  factors,  including  the  quality  of  management\nand the nature of production technology. The skills of the workforce, and the ability of workers to\nmove efficiently across sectors as the economy changes are centrally important. The skills and\nflexibility of the workforce make important contributions to the competitiveness of an economy in\nglobal markets.\n\n10.\nOverall, the  workforce  will  require  continuing  improvement  in  basic  education  over  the\nlong  term  to  ensure  that  the  majority  of  the  population  is  well  equipped  with  knowledge  and\nskills required in the age of globalization. Continuing improvements in the quality and efficiency\nof postbasic education and training, especially TESD, are also important.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nThe second major challenge for the Philippines is to raise the productivity and incomes\n11.\nof the poorer segments of the population. The Philippines has made some progress in reducing\nthe incidence of poverty from 35.5 percent of households in 1994 to 32.1 percent in 1997. For\nthe population as a whole, poverty incidence declined from 40.6 percent in 1994 to 37.5 percent\nin 1997. This means that in 1997, 27.25 million Filipinos fell below the official poverty line of an\nannual per capita income of $285 equivalent (P11,388). In general, poverty incidence levels in\nrural  areas  in  each  geographic  region  are  higher  than  in  urban  areas.  Mindanao  remains  the\npoorest  area  with  50.9  percent  of  the  population  below  the  poverty  line,  compared  with\n45.4 percent in Visayas, 35.7 percent in Luzon, and 9.6 percent in the National Capital Region.\nThe difference between urban and rural areas is stark: 18.5 percent of the population in urban\nareas have annual income below the poverty line compared with 44.4 percent in rural areas.9\n\nThe downward trend in poverty incidence suffered a setback at the end of 1998 because\n12.\nof the  Asian financial  crisis and  the  inclement  weather  that  reduced  agricultural  production  on\nwhich  most  poor  households  depend.  A  household  survey  for  an  ADB-financed  study10\nestimated  that  the  proportion  of  families  who  rated  themselves  poor  rose  from  40 percent  in\n1997 to 43  percent  in  1999.  The  data  clearly  indicate  the  need  to  pay  more  attention  to  rural\npoverty reduction. One of the key means to escape poverty is empowerment with education and\nemployable skills.\n\nSocial  indicators  in  the  Philippines  show  positive  developments  in  recent  years.  The\n13.\ncountry\u2019s Human Development Index (HDI) improved from 0.711 in 1990 to 0.740 in 1999.11 The\nPhilippines  was  placed  77th  in  HDI  global  ranking  among  174  countries  and  compared\nreasonably  well  with  its  neighboring  countries  such  as  Thailand  (HDI,  0.753),  Malaysia  (HDI,\n0.768) and Indonesia (HDI, 0.681). Within the country, the trend is also encouraging.  In 1994,\nMetro Manila had an average HDI of 0.925 and five provinces in Luzon enjoyed a high average\nHDI ranging from 0.774 to 0.840. Provinces with the lowest HDI, ranging from 0.372  to  0.445,\nwere mainly in Mindanao.\n\n                                               \n9   National Statistics Coordination Board 1999. 1997 Philippines Poverty Statistics.\n10  Reyes,  C.M.,  R.G.

It  can  also  serve  as  a  means  to  reduce  poverty  by\nexpanding \nto  promote\nentrepreneurship  and  self-employment  among  the poor.  The  Government  recognized  this  fact\nwhen  it  created  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority  (TESDA)  in  1994\nwith  the  mandate  to  \u201cpromote  and  strengthen  the  quality  of  TESD  programs  to  attain\ninternational competitiveness.\u201d\n\ntraining  opportunities  and \n\nincreasing  access \n\nto  skills \n\ntraining \n\nSkills training in the Philippines has three distinguishing characteristics: (i) the existence\n15.\nof  a  comprehensive  agency  (i.e.,  TESDA)  overseeing  all  levels  and  types  of  training,  (ii)  a\ncomplex network of training providers, and (iii) the high proportion of skills training provided by\nthe private sector.\n\n16.\n TESD is coordinated by a  single agency  (TESDA)  covering  all aspects  of  the  system,\nincluding  school-based,  center-based,  community-based,  and  enterprise-based  training.  In\n1994, by recommendation of the Congressional Commission on Education, all types of  middle\nlevel  skills development  (MLSD)  were  integrated  under  TESDA.  TESDA  combined  the  former\nBureau of Technical and Vocational Education under the Department of Education, Culture and\nSports (DECS), the former National Manpower and Youth Council dealing with nonformal skills\ntraining; and apprenticeship training programs of the Department of Labor and Employment.\n\n17.\nThe structure of TESD is complex. Nearly all preemployment TESD training takes place\nafter  the  completion  of  secondary  school.  Training  is  delivered  in  a  bewildering  array  of\ninstitutions,  including  schools,  institutes,  and  colleges.  Each  may  include  multiple  levels  and\ntypes  of  programs  including  secondary,  postsecondary,  degree,  and  even  postgraduate\ncourses. A comparatively large share of skills training is provided in tertiary institutions, perhaps\nreflecting the short duration of the basic education cycle (only 10 years, with the result that high\nschool  graduates  are  young)  and  also  the  high  cultural  value  attached  to  certification.  Public\nstate  universities  and  colleges  (SUCs)  absorb  more  than  half  of  the  total  public  spending  on\nTESD.\n\n18.\n Sixty percent of all training institutions are private but they accommodate 80 percent of\ntotal enrollments in institution-based middle-level skills development. This makes the Philippines\nunique in the world. Private TESD is financed almost exclusively from nonpublic sources, mainly\nby  tuition  fees  and  endowment  income.  In  contrast  with  other  countries,  there  is  little  or  no\ngovernment subsidy12 for private training.\n\n19.\nIn  addition,  sizable  firms  in  the  manufacturing  sector  show  surprising  dynamism  in\ntraining their own workers. A recent survey shows that 60 percent of firms provided systematic\ntraining for employees and invested significantly in training.13 Virtually all those firms employed\nmore than 50 persons. Smaller firms also provide training, although less often and less formally,\n                                               \n12 Minor  exceptions  are  public  scholarships  for  students  in  private  education,  Private  Education  Student  Fund\nAssistance, which covers only about  3  percent  of  the  students  enrolled in  formal  private training  institutions;  and\nTraining Assistance Contracts under the World Bank-financed Second Vocational Training Project (1992-1998).\n13  Gray,  L.  1996.  Funding,  Financial  Analysis  and  Cost  Effectiveness  in  the  Philippine  Technical  and  Vocational\n\nEducation and Training Sector Specialist Report No. 1, UNIDO/University of Amsterdam Consortium.\n\n\f5\n\nfor  the  most  part  though  on-the-job  skills  transfer.  The  figures  for  large  firms  are  comparable\nwith enterprise commitments to training in other middle-income countries.\n\n20.\nThus,  the  Philippines  has  been  successful  in  establishing  an  extensive  system  for\neducation  and training that has  contributed  to economic and  social goals.  However,  there  are\nconcerns about (i) the role, responsibilities, and management capacity of TESDA; (ii) quality and\nrelevance  of  TESD  programs;  (iii)  constraints  faced  by  private  providers  of  TESD  relative  to\naccess to capital; and (iv) equitable access to TESD programs by the poor.\n\n4.\n\nIssues in TESD\n\nActions in the four areas in para. 20 could make a substantial impact both on Philippine\n21.\nfurther  rationalizing  TESDA\u2019s\ncompetitiveness  and  on  poverty  reduction,  namely:  (i) \nresponsibilities to enable the agency to focus on policy and quality assurance; (ii) improving the\nquality  and  relevance  of  training;  (iii)  improvement  and  expansion  of  private  training;  and\n(iv) removing barriers to equitable access for skills development.\n\na.\n\nTESDA\u2019s Role, Responsibilities, and Capacity for Management\n\n22.\nTESDA was established in 1994 as a policy and quality-assurance agency for postbasic\nTESD.14  In  the  first  years  of  its  existence,  much  of  TESDA\u2019s  attention  was  consumed  by  the\nneed  to  integrate  various  organizational  units  and  the  first  year  of  full  operation  was  1997.\nTESDA\u2019s  mandate  as  the  national  training  authority  is  to  establish  a  supportive  policy\nenvironment  for  middle-level  skills  development;  to  improve  quality  through  standards,\naccreditation  and  monitoring,  research  and  development,  and  technical  assistance;  and  to\nensure equity in the training system. The bulk of  TESD  will  continue  to  come from  the private\nsector and from enterprises that offer training on the job. Accordingly, TESDA\u2019s role in training\nneeds  to  be  rationalized.  TESDA  inherited  the  administration  of  58  technical  and  vocational\nschools  and  about 60  nonformal  training  centers.  The  operation  of  training  centers  consumes\nabout  two  thirds  of  TESDA\u2019s budget and  considerable  staff  time.  It  is  not  appropriate  that  the\nagency that accredits and supervises training institutions also runs them. \n\nAnother  issue  of  management  effectiveness  concerns  a  major  gap  in  the  breadth  of\n23.\nTESDA\u2019s  role  in  middle-level  skills  supervision.  TESDA  is  charged  with  providing  professional\noversight  of  all  middle-level  skills  development\u2014formal  and  nonformal\u2014including  semiskilled,\nskilled,  and  technician  levels.  TESDA  has  oversight  responsibility  for  private  formal  and\nnonformal education  mainly  through  its  registration  and  accreditation  system.  However,  it  has\nno mechanism to provide input and guidance into the  various  kinds of  training provided  within\nSUCs.\n\nIn sum, TESDA needs to rationalize its operations\u2014including divesting its responsibility\n24.\nfor direct administration of training operations, making the process of standards and certification\nmore  efficient,  placing  more  emphasis  on  its  supporting  role  in  systems  monitoring  and\ninformation  dissemination,  and  closing  gaps  in  its  span  of  supervision.  Once  this  process  of\nrationalization  is  completed,  TESDA  will  have  freed  up  staff  resources  for  higher  priority\nactivities,  including  policy  and  standards  development,  training  materials  support,  and  overall\nmonitoring  of  the  system.  One  priority  area  is  in  information  systems  and  data  collection  to\nimprove  the  information  base  for  research  on  TESD.  The  existing  management  information\n\n                                               \n14 See Appendix C for organizational chart of TESDA.\n\n\f6\n\nsystem  (MIS)  developed under the World Bank-financed  Second  Vocational  Training  Project15\nneeds to be strengthened. Training providers need better labor market information to adjust and\nfocus their programs.\n\nb.\n\nQuality and Relevance of TESD\n\n25.\nThe  performance  of  the  TESD  system  is  best  measured  by  the  employment  rates  of\ngraduates,  but  little  current  information exists about  the  performance  of  the  system  in  placing\ngraduates  in  employment.  Many  administrators  of  TESD  schools  and  centers  stated  that  the\ngraduates  are  too  mobile  to  be  tracked  systematically  after  graduation.  Data  from  the  early\n1990s,  as  quoted  in  the  1994  Congressional  Commission  on  Education  report,  claim  that\nabsorption rates at all levels and types of TESD were low. Employment rates were 31 percent\namong  graduates  of  postsecondary  nondegree  courses.  The  best  performance  was  by\ngraduates from schools with short-term (generally nonformal) courses who achieve a 54 percent\nemployment  rate.16  Placement  rates  increased  substantially  in  the  mid-1990s  as  job  creation\nsurged  and  employment  prospects  brightened.  Anecdotal  evidence  supports  this.  Institutions\nquote  absorption  rates  from  50  percent  upward  to  95  percent  for  the  better  institutions.\nHowever, employment rates appear to have declined during the economic downturn of the late\n1990s.  This  remains  speculative  until  more  data  are  collected.  TESDA  needs  to  do  more,\ndirectly  or  through  schools,  to  collect  timely  and  reliable  information  about  the  employment\nstatus  and  economic  performance  of  TESD  graduates  of  institutions  of  various  types  and\nlocations.\n\n26.\nTESDA  has  introduced  trade  testing  almost  exclusively  for  skills  at  the  technician  and\nmiddle-level craftsman level. More than 220 trade tests have been developed. Their scope and\ndepth  are  considered  appropriate  as  they  are  validated  by  employers.  The  tests  are  taken\nmainly by students completing their studies, rather than workers in employment. The tests give\na  useful  proxy  measure  of  the  quality  of  skills  attainment  of  the  graduates.  Unfortunately,  the\nperformance  achievements  are  not  high.  Only  about  49  percent  of  those  who  took  the\nexaminations  in  1995  passed,  and  the  average  declined  to  38  percent  in  1998.  This\nexceptionally low result is a worrisome indicator of pervasive low quality in the system.\n\nOne explanation for low quality is the wide variance in inputs needed for high standards\n27.\nin training. Trainers tend to have strong academic qualifications, but lack skills qualifications and\nindustrial  experience.  Only  about  30  percent  of  the  trainers  had  trade  certification  and  only\n9 percent  had  industrial  experience.17  Both  private  and  public  institutions  tend  to  suffer  from\nshortages of equipment and budgets for consumable training supplies.\n\n28.\nThe program of skill testing, valuable as an exit standard of quality attained, needs to be\nextended  to  cover  more  occupations  and  expanded  by  establishing  more  testing  centers\nthroughout the country.\n\n                                               \n15 World Bank, Philippines: Second Vocational Training Project (Credit 2392-PH), for  $36 million,  approved  in  June\n\n1992.\n\n16 Congressional  Commission  on  Education.  1994.

In Review of the Philippine Technical Vocational Education\nand Training Sector. Asian Development Bank, TA 2627, April 1997, Paper No. 5, p. 28.\n\n\f7\n\nIn  terms  of  relevance,  the  curricula,  training  equipment,  and  training  methodologies  in\n29.\nthe  majority of  institutes  have  lagged behind  the  rapid  changes  and  development  in  business\nand  industry.  Training  curricula  tend  to  be  rigid  and  static.  Regardless  of  the  local  demand\nTESDA\u2019s  regional  training  centers  give  training  in  seven  occupations  such  as  welding,\nautomechanics, and carpentry that were identified in the early 1970s. One survey of training for\nmanufacturing  found  that  three  fourths  of  the  institutions  had  not  updated  or  revised  the\ncurriculum  during  the  previous  five  years.18  Clearly,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  improve  the\nquality  and  relevance  of  TESD  skills  training  programs  to  produce  highly  qualified  skilled\nworkers for the economy.\n\n30.\nTESDA has taken initiatives to improve the situation in three areas. It has introduced a\nsystem19 of registration and accreditation designed to ensure that new programs and institutions\nmeet minimum levels of quality. Both private and public institutions must seek advance approval\nfor  all  courses  and  pass  a  minimum  threshold  for  authorization.  If  sensibly  administered,  this\nsystem promises to stimulate substantial changes and improvements in private education. It will\neliminate some of the fly-by-night operators of doubtful repute. It will cause others to merge or\nundertake improvement programs.\n\n31.\nTESDA has converted TESD programs to a system of competency-based training, which\ninvolves  employers  in  identifying  competencies  required  for  particular  occupations  and\ndeveloping training modules focused on achieving those outputs. Competency-based training is\npart  of  the  new  registration  and  accreditation  program.  This  system  promises  to  make  TESD\nmore effective by focusing on the essentials and eliminating unnecessary content from training.\nTESDA  is  also  providing  positive  incentives  for  quality  improvement  in  training  through  its\nannual  awards  for  training  excellence.  These  provide  considerable  leverage  on  the  system\nwithout much cost.\n\n32.\nOther initiatives include TESDA\u2019s role in the  development  of  trade  standards.  Over  the\npast  two  years  TESDA,  with  industry  participation,  has  identified  seven  priority  sectors  and\ndeveloped 13 training regulations comprising trade standards plus competency-based curricula,\nwhich will be gradually introduced. The standards will enable training institutions and employers\nto assess the quality of graduates more objectively based on the identified competencies.\n\n33.\nPrograms  for  quality  assurance  are  embryonic.  TESDA  has  initiated  several  programs\ndesigned  to  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  TESD  systemwide,  but  needs  much  more\nsupport  to  be  able  to  implement  them  properly.  Specifically,  assistance  is  needed  to  support\nTESDA  in  programming,  refining,  and  implementing  these  quality  improvement  programs.  In\naddition, substantial capital investment is needed to replenish and update equipment and train\nstaff in new fields and training methodologies.\n\nc.\n\nConstraints on the Private Providers of TESD\n\n34.\nPrivate TESD institutions enroll about 80 percent of total TESD students. In general, the\nprivate TESD schools are more cost-effective than  their public  counterparts. On  a per  student\nbasis, private training costs less than public training. One study found that for skilled worker and\ntechnician-level  training,  private  costs  per  graduate  were  only  70  percent  and  45  percent,\n\n                                               \n18  Biervliet,  Wim  and  Arnold  Morfe,  1996.

About 90 percent of the private institutions had staff/student ratios above 1:12 whereas\n66 percent of the government schools had staff/student ratios below 1:12. Overall, taking both\ncosts and impact into account, private training is more cost-effective than government training.\n\n35.\nNevertheless,  enrollments  in  the  private  TESD  system  have  been  declining.  Between\n1996 and 1997, enrollment in private technical vocational schools reportedly fell by 21 percent.\nThe  regulatory  environment  does  not  appear  to  be  the  issue;  private  training  providers  in  the\nPhilippines generally find  TESDA  regulation  appropriate.22  One  constraint  is  the private  TESD\nproviders\u2019  lack  of  access  of  to  credit.  Very  few  commercial  sources  give  private  schools\nfinancing  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  programs.  Private providers, especially  small  schools,\noften do not have the collateral required by commercial lenders.\n\n36.\nAnother  constraint  is  unfair  competition  from  the  heavily  subsidized  SUCs.  These\ninstitutions  have  been  introducing  courses  already  available  in  private  institutions  and  are\nattracting potential students with their low fees.\n\nd.\n\nInequitable Access\n\nThe  TESD  system enrolls  a  large  share  of  students  from  poor  households.  One  study\n37.\nfound that three fourths of the students in TESD came from low-income families.23  More recent\nobservations found the range of students from poor backgrounds to be 60-90 percent (Appendix\nB). Skills development is an important means for disadvantaged people to improve their income\nand  quality  of  life.  However,  three  sets  of  barriers  impede  upward  mobility:  financial  barriers,\ngeographic and gender barriers, and structural impediments.\n\n38.\nFirst,  lack  of  finance  limits  access  to  TESD  programs  for  a  large  number  of  the  poor.\nEven  with  the  currently  low  tuition  fees  in  public  institutions,  poor  families  without  stable\nemployment and with incomes below the poverty line have difficulty in supporting their children\nattending  TESD  institutions.  The  situation  is  more  difficult  when  the  poorer  children  attend\nprivate  institutions  that  charge  student  fees  higher  than  those  in  public  schools.  Although  the\nGovernment provides scholarships for private TESD schools, only a relatively small percentage\n(about 3 percent) of students receive financial assistance. The Private Education Student Fund\nAssistance  (PESFA)  scholarships  for  disadvantaged  students  is  administered  by  TESDA\nthrough  its  regional  and  provincial  offices.  Allocations  are  made  to  provinces  by  TESDA\naccording to a formula that takes into account poverty incidence in the area. More than 10,700\nscholarships were  awarded  in  school  year  (SY)  1999,  and  the number  increased  to  13,500  in\n\n                                               \n20 Gray, L. 1996 op. cit. p. 26.\n21 Ibid., p. 4.\n22 For example, tuition fee ceilings apply only to students enrolled in the second year of courses. Institutions are free\nto  establish  fee  levels  for  new  courses  and  for  new  cohorts  entering  existing  courses.  Moreover,  TESDA\naccreditation and occupational standards are generally welcomed as improving the standards in the industry.\n\n23  Vergara  and  Valisno  (1985)  as  quoted  in  Doctor,  R.  M.  1995.  The  Role  of  Private  Technical  and  Vocational\nEducation and Training Institutions in the Philippines.

These scholarships are held by students, subject to satisfactory performance, for two\nyears  of  study  at  an  institution  of  the  student\u2019s  choosing.  PESFA  scholarships  thus  function\nmuch  like  vouchers  and  reportedly  work  well.  PESFA  is  an  important  way  to  provide  indirect\npublic support to private institutions that will achieve both equity and efficiency objectives.\n\n39.\nSecond,  other  barriers  are  a  limited  geographic  distribution  of  TESD  institutions  and\ngender  biases.  Most  (86  percent)  TESD  institutions  are  in  urban  areas,  limiting  the  access  of\nrural  populations  that  constitute  the  majority  in  the  Philippines.  Enrollments  in  postsecondary\nnondegree  courses  in  the  National  Capital  Region  account  for  42  percent  of  the  total  student\npopulation;  enrollment  in  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim  Mindanao  is  0.23  percent  of  the\nnational  total.24  Rural parents  who  send  their  children  to  the cities to attend  TESD  incur extra\ncosts.  In  terms  of  gender  participation,  about  40 percent  of  the  enrollees  in  TESD  institutions\nare women. This figure is higher than that in most countries worldwide and in the region, but is\nstill less than parity.  Most  women  tend  to  concentrate  in traditional programs  such as  sewing,\narts and crafts, and food services, which usually lead to low-paying jobs. Far fewer women take\nthe national trade tests after completion of their studies (7,400 women in the first half of 1998,\ncompared  with  26,700  men).  Only  about  33  percent  of  the  women  passed  the  trade  test\n(compared with 39 percent of the men.) In part the problem rests with gender segmentation in\nthe  labor  market,  which  perpetuates  unequal  incomes  for  women  in  the  job  market  (see\nAppendix B).\n\n40.\nThird,  disadvantaged  students  who  do  attend  TESD  institutions  are  discriminated\nagainst  through  lack  of  opportunities  for  further  advancement  in  the  education  system.  TESD\nsuffers  a  poor  image  and  is  perceived  as  a  dead-end  and  last-choice  option  among  many\nparents and students. This aversion has deep historical roots and was reinforced by the former\nnational college  entrance  examination.  If  one failed the examination, the only avenue  left  was\nTESD.  The  poor  reputation  is  reinforced  by  the  lack  of  transferability  of  credits  from  TESD\nprograms to further studies elsewhere. Since the majority of students in TESD come from poor\nfamilies with incomes near or below the poverty line, they lack opportunities for further studies.\nA  well-developed  equivalency  system  for  TESD  programs  similar  to  the  Accreditation  and\nEquivalency  system  established  under  the  ADB-financed  Nonformal  Education  Project25  will\nhelp TESD students transfer from one program to another or transfer credits earned from one\nschool  to  another.  In addition,  it  will provide  a  means for people  who have  acquired  technical\nknowledge  and  skills  through  work  and  experience  outside  the  TESD  system  to  obtain\ncertification  and  accreditation  through  skills  testing  for  further  TESD  training  and  career\nadvancement. This kind of equivalence is especially important for children from poorer families\nparticularly  those  who  do  not  finish  high  school  and  hence  would  not  normally  qualify  for\nentrance  to  TESDA  programs.  Establishment  of  equivalency  programs  will  make  TESD  more\nattractive  and  open  TESD  institutions  to  the  poor  and  those  who  want  to  improve  their\nlivelihood.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n41.\nThe proposed Project will assist the Government in implementing the main elements of\nits medium-term strategy for skills development. The government policy is to promote economic\ngrowth  and  improve  social  equity  so  as  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  social  harmony.

The  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  Project,32  implemented  from  1982  to  1988,\nwas  a  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  concern  over  the  shortage  of  qualified  middle-level\ntechnicians.  The  Project  aimed  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  technical-vocational  education\ndelivery  system  by  strengthening  planning  and  management  of  the  subsector,  promoting\nresearch  and  curriculum  development, \nteaching  and\nnonteaching staff, and enabling 22 public technical education institutions under DECS to deliver\nimproved training courses for technicians.

The  Project  was\ndesigned  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  establish  the  National  Agricultural  Education\nSystem  by  (i) strengthening  13  provincial  technical  institutes  of  agriculture  and  higher  level\ninstitutions;  (ii)  strengthening  sector  management  including  the  institutionalization  of  a  benefit\nmonitoring  system  and  industry  liaison-guidance  counseling  services;  and  (iii) institutional\nrestructuring of the various teaching institutions. The project also supported the establishment of\nfarmer  training  centers  for  informal  short-course  training.  The  lessons  arising  are  given  in\npara. 53.\n\n49.\nIn  addition,  the  World  Bank-financed  Second  Vocational  Training  Project,  approved  in\nJune  1992  and  completed  on  31  December  1999,  financed  four  programs:  institutional\ndevelopment, improving training quality, developing training capacity, and studies and research\nin  TESD.  In  addition,  an  integrated  computer-based  information  system  in  the  National\nManpower  Information System  (NMIS)  was  established  to aid  TESDA  in  its  policy  formulation\ntasks  to  better  manage  the  TESD  sector.  See  para.  55  for  the  main  findings  from  the\nimplementation of the Project.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe proposed Project takes into account the lessons of previous investments to support\n\n50.\nskills development in the Philippines (Appendix 2).\n\nA reevaluation of ADB\u2019s Technical and Vocational Education Project34 found that it partly\n51.\nsucceeded  in  attaining  its  objectives.  It  contributed  to  improving  the  delivery  system  of  the\ntechnician program, which increased the qualifications of student output above the target set at\nappraisal.  But  with  rapid  technological  development,  further  improvements  were  needed.  In-\nservice  training,  research,  and  curriculum  development  were  introduced  during  project\nimplementation,  but  only  in-service  training  has  been  sustained  at  the  national  center.  The\n                                               \n31 World  Bank, Philippines: Second Vocational Training Project (Credit 2392-PH),  for  $36 million  approved  in  June\n\n1992.\n\n32 Loan 531-PHI: Technical and Vocational Education Project, for $27 million, approved on 8 October 1981.\n33 Loan 884-PHI (SF): Agricultural Technology Education Project, for $15.87 million, approved on 8 March 1988.\n34 Reevaluation of Loan No. 531-PHI: Technical and Vocational Education Project, September 1998.\n\n\f13\n\nresults  of  the  reevaluation  suggested  that  the  subsector  still  needed  improvement  in  the\nimplementation  of  labor  market  information  systems,  tracer  studies,  and  introduction  of  an\naccreditation system.\n\nFor future ADB interventions in the subsector, the reevaluation concludes that sufficient\n52.\nsupport  should  be  given  to  the  private  providers  of  TESD,  which  enrolls  80  percent  of  the\nstudents in this sector. Further, the terms and conditions of support (i.e., provision of loan funds)\nshould  be  realistic,  flexible,  and  free  from  stringent  administrative  requirements  to  allow  the\nprivate  institutions  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  market  more  effectively.  The  study  also\ncautions  against  the  tendency  of  assisted  schools  to  broaden  their  scope  and  programs  and\nconcentrate  on  higher-level  courses  in  an  effort  to  become  part  of  the  SUC  network,  with  a\nconsequent loss of focus on TESD to prepare skilled workers.\n\nA  postevaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  Agricultural  Technology  Education  Project35  in  1999  found\n53.\nthat  the  project  outputs  were  established  as  planned,  with  two  major  exceptions:  the  benefit\nmonitoring system was not institutionalized but done as an ad hoc study, and the administrative\nsystem  was  not  fully  restructured  due  to  the  objections  raised  by  the  provincial  technical\ninstitutes  of  agriculture.  The  evaluation  indicates  that  the  Project  had  expanded  the  range  of\nagriculture  courses,  and  hence,  the  range  of  skills  of  the  graduates.  However,  no  data  are\navailable to clearly show employment results or the fit of the skills of the new type of graduates\nto  the  demand  of  the  job  market.  At  the  institution  level,  many  facilities  and  capabilities  were\nenhanced,  yet  management  weaknesses  with  respect  to  maintenance  of facilities  persist,  and\nthe  objective  of  improving  self-financing  by  the  schools  was  not  met.  Because  of  the  mixed\nresults  and  concerns  about  the  sustainability  of  the  benefits,  the  project  was  rated  partly\nsuccessful.\n\n54.\nTo improve the planning and management of the TESD system, it was pointed out that it\nis very  important  to  regularly  gather and  evaluate  information concerning  market  demands for\ntypes of skills and programs that enable resources to be used effectively. The design of TESD\nprojects should be based on realistic assessments of the aspirations of the intended students,\nthe  constraints  of  the  industry  to  which  the  training  is  targeted,  and  the  overall  education\nsystem. As for financial assistance to the students, living expenses are a major cost  item.  For\nscholarships to be effective in opening up access to low-income families, they must contribute\nsubstantially to living expenses.\n\n55.\nThe  main  findings  from  the  implementation  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  Vocational\nTraining Project36 were that (i) the project design was overly complex and led to delays; (ii) too\nmany  activities  ran  in  parallel  with  ongoing  TESDA  programs,  thereby  straining  the  staff  and\ncausing delays; (iii) more attention should have been paid to measurement and assessment of\noutcomes  including  the  benefits  of  training  programs;  (iv) there  was  no  acceptance  of  skills\ncertification of workers, curricula, and teaching materials; and (v) the project had no impact on\nprivate  service  providers.  On  the  positive  side,  the  project  experienced  several  successes,\nincluding  the  initial  development  of  a  manpower  information  system,  locally  generated\ncommunity-based  training  programs,  in-plant  training  of  trainers,  and  initial  development  of\nTESDA staff in policy and research activities. The review concluded that \u201cTESDA has acquired\nthe technical capacity to efficiently implement sector investments while assuring the quality and\n\n                                               \n35 PPA: PHI 15073: Agricultural Technology Education Project, February 1999.\n36  World  Bank,  Philippines:  Second  Vocational  Training  Project  (Credit  2392-PH)\u2014Implementation  Completion\n\nReport, 15 March 2000.\n\n\f14\n\nrelevance  of  its  programs.

In  particular,  the  program  concentrates  on  promoting\nequitable growth, better provision of basic social services like health care and basic education,\nand  improved  management  and  protection  of  the  environment.  The  Country  Operational\nStrategy  further  recommends  that  ADB  extend  investment  support  to  improving  the  standard\nand coverage of technical and scientific education at the postsecondary level to ensure that an\ninadequate supply of technically  and scientifically  trained  labor  does  not  pose  a  constraint  on\nindustrial growth, especially in skill-intensive sectors. It adds that these interventions would  be\nespecially  valuable,  given  that  less  than  6  percent  of  the  labor  force  in  the  country  currently\nhave appropriate technical skills.\n\n58.\nThe  focus  on  poverty  reduction  and  social  development  directly  supports  ADB\u2019s\noverarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy38  emphasizes  the\nimportance  of  access to  basic  education  and  primary  health  services.  The  paper  emphasizes\nthat, among other things, ADB will provide strong and  innovative  support  to expand  access  to\nquality basic and nonformal education and skills development, particularly for women, girls, and\nothers excluded for social and geographic reasons.\n\n59.\nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  objective  of  poverty  reduction,  the  ongoing  Nonformal  Education\nProject  (footnote  25)  has  directly  and  significantly  contributed  to  poverty  reduction  through\nliteracy and livelihood programs and the introduction of an accreditation and equivalency system\nto  benefit  the  poor,  especially  out-of-school  youth  and  adults,  and  disadvantaged  groups\nthroughout  the  Philippines.  The  project  demonstrates  ADB\u2019s  dedication  in  providing  the  poor\nwith opportunities to acquire literacy and livelihood skills, as well as elementary and secondary\neducation qualifications through innovative approaches.\n\nADB\u2019s draft education policy paper39 recognizes the importance of skills development in\n60.\nthe context of economic development.  Maintaining  competitiveness and  improving productivity\nin an era of globalization and diminishing trade barriers demand that the skills of the workforce\nbe  continually  upgraded.  The  paper  points  out,  however,  that  government-financed  skills\ntraining  programs  are  often  supply-driven,  are  delivered  at  higher  unit  cost  than  similar\nprograms  provided  by  the  private  sector,  and  are  often  in  direct  competition  with  the  private\nsector.  ADB  support  for  skills  development  should  therefore  concentrate  on  (i) upgrading\ngovernment  capacity  to  coordinate  (but  not  to  provide)  skills  training  and  to  establish  and\nmonitor  skills  standards;  (ii)  encouraging  private  sector  provision  of  training  by  helping\ngovernments  establish  conducive  policy  environments  and  incentives;  and  (iii)  helping  to\nestablish skills development funds that can be used by agencies such as NGOs to provide skills\ntraining for the poor, especially women.\n\n                                               \n37 Ibid., pp. 8, 9.\n38 R179-99:Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific.

It\nfurther  highlights  the  need  to  rationalize  the  management  of  the  TESD  system,  accelerate\nimplementation  of  quality  assurance  programs,  support  the  role  of  the  private  sector,  and\nimplement  measures  to  improve  the  access  of  the  poor  to  skills  training.  During  project\nappraisal,  understanding  was  reached  with  the  Government  for  the  implementation  of  the\nfollowing specific measures to strengthen the TESD system.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nRationalizing the role and functions of TESDA. The role, functions, and capacity\nof  TESDA  as an  oversight agency  will  be  rationalized  and  strengthened  by  the\nend of the Project to enable it to focus on sector development, quality assurance,\nmonitoring,  supervision,  and  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  TESD\nsystem as a whole.\nDevolving public TESD institutions. In line with the provision  of  the  TESDA  Act,\nTESDA  will  formulate  strategies  and  develop  a  comprehensive  implementation\nplan to devolve the 25 public schools and 45 provincial training centers to LGUs,\nother government agencies, NGOs, and the communities.\nInstitutionalizing  and  expanding  TESD  quality  assurance  system.  Quality\nassurance programs will be institutionalized and expanded to include a minimum\ntarget of 240 private and 25 public TESD institutions during the life of the Project.\nDeveloping  and  implementing  TESD  equivalency  system.  A  TESD  equivalency\nsystem  similar  to  the  Accreditation  and  Equivalency  System  established  under\nthe Nonformal Education Project will be developed and implemented nationwide\nby  December  2003  to  allow  greater  transferability  of  work  experience,  skills,\ncredits,  and  certification  between  formal  and  nonformal  TESD  programs  and\nbetween TESD institutions and other types of institutions.\nSupporting private providers of TESD programs. To encourage private providers\nof  TESD  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  programs  and  to  recognize  their\ncontributions, measures such as quality assurance programs, staff development\nprograms, financing facility, and student scholarships will be implemented.\n\nThese  measures  and  mechanisms  will  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  the  more\nimmediate issues facing the  TESD  system.  However,  several  issues  are  beyond  the  scope of\nthis Project and will be addressed through a planned sector development program based on the\nPESS  and  the  recently  submitted  report  from  the  Presidential  Commission  on  Educational\nReform.  Project  preparatory  TA  for  the  sector  development  program  will  support  the\nimplementation of the key recommendations of the  Presidential  Commission.  Several  of  these\nmeasures seek fair competition between public and private institutions.40\n\n                                               \n40 The Presidential  Commission  on  Educational  Reform recommended,  among  others,  freezing  public subsidies  for\nSUCs and then progressively reducing them over five years. This would result in greater resource mobilization by\nSUCs,  including  increased  tuition  fees.  It  also  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  Coordinating  Council  on\nEducation  where  matters  such  as  TESDA\u2019s  span  of  supervisory  authority,  e.g.,  over  SUCs,  can  be  tabled  and\naddressed.\n\n\f16\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nThe Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan emphasizes \u201ceconomic growth with\n62.\nsocial equity\u201d and the role of the private sector in improving industrial productivity to compete in\nthe global economy. This policy calls for the development of a highly skilled workforce. To meet\nthese requirements, the TESD system, as the main provider of technicians and skilled workers,\nmust  be  responsive  to  rapidly  changing  technology  and  the  demands  of  industry.  TESD\nprograms  must  be  flexible,  industry-oriented,  and  demand-driven.  The  present  TESD  system\nwith  its  supply-driven  orientation,  outdated  curricula,  poor  facilities,  and  inadequate  teaching\nequipment cannot effectively produce the skilled workforce required by the economy. Promoting\n\u201csocial  equity\u201d  requires  that  the  poor  have  wider  access  to  services,  including  better\nopportunities for skills training and employment with necessary support.  For these  goals to be\nrealized,  it  is first necessary to  rationalize  the system  of  skills  development.  Rationalization  in\nthis context means to enable the principal parts of the system\u2014public/private, central/local\u2014to\nthe  system.\nplay \nRationalization of the skills development system has three principal elements: strengthening the\ncentral agency to lead, oversee and coordinate skills training throughout the country; devolving\nthe operation  of  training  institutions from  the  center  to  the  localities; and  removing  constraints\nthat  impede  private  skills  training.  The  Project  seeks to  rationalize  the  overall  system  through\nthese three means, and to build social equity in skills acquisition.\n\ntheir  appropriate  roles  and  maximize \n\nthe  overall  effectiveness  of \n\n63.\n\nThe Project\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nresponds to the basic requirements of improved competitiveness and equity;\naddresses key weaknesses in the present system of skills development;\nsupports  the  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  and  well-documented  plan  for\nskills development in the Philippines;\ntakes  into  account  lessons  learned  from  previous  assistance  to  the  subsector;\nand\nis consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and education policies.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n64.\nThe overall aim of the Project is to enhance competitiveness for the Philippines through\ngreater relevance and quality in skills development. The secondary objective is to contribute to\npoverty  reduction.  The  Project  has  four  specific  objectives:  (i)  to  rationalize  the  role  and\nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  TESDA,  (ii)  to  devolve  TESDA\u2019s  responsibilities  for  training\ninstitutions to LGUs or NGOs, (iii) to strengthen the capacity of private providers of TESD, and\n(iv) to enhance equity in skills acquisition.\n\n1. \n\nStrengthening TESDA\n\nIn the context of skills training, the role of the Government should be able to perform key\n65.\nfunctions  that  cannot  be,  or  are  not,  done  by  the  private  sector.  This  includes  policy\ndevelopment, establishment of standards, assessment of the system and its outputs, curriculum\nand teacher development, and research and financing  of  innovations to  improve  the quality  of\nTESD. The Philippines is fortunate to have a single, integrated authority, TESDA, in charge of\nthese functions for all middle-level skills development.\n\n\f17\n\nThe first  objective of  the  Project  is  to focus and  strengthen  the  work  of  TESDA  as the\n66.\nmain  coordinating  agency  for  skills  development  in  the  Philippines.  This  objective  will  be\naccomplished by  institutionalizing  TESDA\u2019s quality  assurance  programs,  and  by  strengthening\ncapacity and resources within TESDA.\n\na. \n\nInstitutionalizing Quality Assurance Programs\n\n67.\nThe  1998  PESS  found  that  skills  training  was  basically  on  the  right  track  in  the\nPhilippines  under  the  direction  of  TESDA.  One  reason  was  TESDA\u2019s  well-conceived  quality\nassurance system, which seeks to improve the quality of TESD programs. However, additional\nassistance  is  needed  to  institutionalize  the  proposed  programs  and  to  expand  their  coverage\nnationwide.  The first program  pertains  to  registration  and  accreditation  of  training,  both  in  the\npublic and private sectors. Under the Project, assistance will  be  provided for  the expansion  of\nthe  registration,  assessment,  and  accreditation  of  TESD  institutions  nationwide.  Initially  the\nProject  targets  240  private  institutions  and  the  25  public  institutions.  The  second  aspect  of\nquality assurance is occupational standards and certification, an area where the Philippines has\nsound  experience  on  which  to  build.  TESDA  will  be  assisted  to  expand  the  system  by\ndeveloping  additional  standards  and  a  qualification  framework.  In  particular,  50  skills\nassessment centers will be established within existing TESD institutions throughout the country.\nThe  centers  will  be  equipped  and,  in  some  cases,  facilities  will  be  renovated.  In  addition,\npersonnel of the centers will receive training in skills testing and assessing the quality of TESD\nprograms.\n\n68.\nAn  equivalency  and  certification  system  will  be  implemented  and  expanded  in  the\ndesignated  skills  assessment  centers.  The  system  will  give  qualifying  credits  and  issue\ncertificates  to  students,  trainees,  and  other  persons  who  pass  the  examinations  and\nassessments. In addition to providing credits and recognition to skills and experience acquired\noutside  formal  TESD  programs,  the  equivalency  system  will  provide  further \nlearning\nopportunities for those who have acquired other forms of prior learning. TESDA and the Bureau\nof  Nonformal  Education  under  DECS  have  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  to  allow\nholders  of  secondary  certificates  obtained  through  the  accreditation  and  equivalency  system,\nimplemented  under  the  ADB-financed  Nonformal  Education  Project  (footnote  25)  to  enroll  in\nTESD programs  and  acquire  technical  qualifications for  career development.  A  similar  system\nwill  be  developed  under  the  Project  for  trainees  and  workers  to  obtain  skills  certification  and\nqualification  for  further  education  and  career  advancement.  Social  marketing  abilities  will  be\nlaunched to increase social acceptability of MLSD programs.\n\nb.\n\nStrengthening the Role and Capacity of TESDA\n\n69.\nTESDA plays a central  role  in  overall  skills development, but  some  of  its functions are\nnot well-developed and  need to be  strengthened.  Among  these functions  are  its  management\ninformation  system,  research,  curricula  and  course  development  capacity,  and  distance\nteaching.\n\nFirst, the Project will provide consulting  services for an overall  institutional  assessment\n70.\nof  TESDA  with  a  view  to  rationalizing  its  management  structure  and  functions.  The  principle\nunderlying this analysis will be to devolve functions as far as possible and rationalize TESDA\u2019s\nfunctions  along  the  four  legally  mandated  functions:  (i)  development  planning,  (ii)  standard\nsetting,  (iii)  resource  allocation,  and  (iv)  policy  formulation.  Appendix  3  gives  the  terms  of\nreference for the institutional analysis.\n\n\f18\n\nSecond,  the  Project  will  support  the  training  of  national  and  local  TESDA  staff  in\n71.\nresearch, policy analysis, planning, management, and monitoring and evaluation to enable them\nto better carry out TESDA\u2019s mandate as an oversight agency. In view of the key role of TESDA\nin disseminating information on skills demands in the market as well as  training  providers,  the\nProject  will  boost  the  research  capacity  of  TESDA  to  conduct  key  policy  analyses,  project\ndevelopment, and to propose policy directives.\n\n72.\nThird,  the  Project  provides  support  for  further  development  of  the  educational\nmanagement  information  system  (EMIS).  Progress  was  made  under  the World  Bank-financed\nSecond Vocational Training Project to develop a national manpower information system (NMIS),\nbut  additional  work\u2014accelerating  hardware  and  software  development,  training  staff,  and\nextending the network to regional and provincial levels\u2014is needed to enhance its capacity.\n\n73.\nFourth,  TESDA\u2019s  capacity  to  provide  relevant  and  high-quality  courseware  to  training\ninstitutions will be increased. Courseware, instructional packages, and teachers\u2019 handbooks and\nguides will be procured or developed in priority areas  such as  information  and  communication\ntechnology, engineering technology, production  technology,  and electronics.  The  materials  will\nbe available for purchase by public and private institutions. Staff development programs will also\nbe offered to teachers of both private and public schools to upgrade their knowledge and skills\nin courseware design and development and the teaching skills required to effectively implement\nthe new packages in the schools. Details of the staff development programs are in Appendix C.\nThe  first  priority  will  be  to  buy  off-the-shelf  existing  courses  that  have  proved  effective\nelsewhere. In this regard, TESDA will contribute an important screening and evaluation function\nto the selection of materials.\n\n74.\nFifth, TESDA\u2019s capacity to develop and deliver distance teaching will be supported as a\nmeans,  initially,  to  achieve  cost-effective  delivery  of  teacher  training  programs.  A  distance\neducation  program  for  teachers  will  be  developed  and  pilot-tested  in  five  of  the  project\ninstitutions across the country. The experimental centers, supported by the regional centers, will\nmake  skills  training  programs  available  to  a  wider  population.  Instructional  modules  and\npackages will be developed through the use of multimedia, print, and nonprint materials, to be\nused  first  for  training  of  trainers  and  teacher  upgrading  programs.  Subsequently,  the  trainers\nand teachers trained will introduce skills training programs through distance delivery of courses\nand modules, leading to trade qualification upgrading and skills testing. It is envisaged that any\nmedia  work  involved  will  be  contracted  out  on  a  commercial  basis  rather  than  building  the\ncapacity within TESDA.\n\n2. \n\nDevolving Training Functions to LGUs and NGOs\n\n75.\nA corollary of strengthening the central functions of TESDA is for TESDA to devolve its\ndirect training responsibilities to LGUs, communities, institutions, and NGOs. At present, TESDA\nstill  administers  58  technical,  vocational,  and  agricultural  schools  and  45 provincial  training\ncenters  through  its  regional  and  provincial  offices.  The  devolution  of  responsibilities  for  these\ntraining  institutions  from  the  center  to  the  local  levels  is  expected  to  realize  several  benefits.\nFirst, training programs can be linked better to the needs of local enterprises. Second, training\ninstitutions  can become  more  self-financing.  In  short,  locally  controlled  training  institutions  will\nhave to be more responsible for finding their own markets and financing. The Project, therefore,\nsupports  implementation of  the  policy  of  devolving  the  training  function  from  TESDA  to  LGUs\nand  other  institutions,  NGOs,  or  foundations.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  assist\nTESDA  in  the  formulation  of  strategies  and  plans  for  devolution.  In  addition,  the  Project  will\nprovide resources to (i) strengthen the management capacity of local staff who will be involved\n\n\f19\n\nin  the  devolution  process,  and  (ii)  upgrade  the  facilities  of  the  project  public  institutions  in\npreparation for devolution.\n\na. \n\nDeveloping the Management and Staff of Local Institutions\n\n76.\nOne of the main requirements for successful devolution  is  to  prepare  the  management\nand  staff  of  local  organizations,  and  of  the  training  institutions  themselves,  to  accept  the\nadditional responsibilities. The Project provides assistance to empower and equip personnel at\nthe  local  and  school  levels  to  manage  and  supervise  TESD  programs  that  are  responsive  to\nlocal needs. Administrators, key school officials, and LGU personnel who will be involved in the\ndevolution process and responsible for planning, managing, and supervising TESD  institutions\nand  programs  at  the  local  and  school  levels  will  undergo  training  to  be  organized  under  the\nProject.  The  staff  development  programs  for  this  subcomponent  emphasize  planning,\nmanagement,  supervision,  and  assessment  of  TESD  institutions.  LGU  personnel  will  be\nselected from among those  who  will  be  involved  in  implementing  the  devolution of  the  project\ninstitutions.  School-based  supervisory,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  systems \nto  ensure\ncontinuous  self-improvement  will be  institutionalized  in  the project  institutions.  These  activities\nwill enable LGUs and the project institutions to plan and manage their  skills  training programs\nmore effectively.\n\nb. \n\nDeveloping the Training Facilities\n\n77.\nProject resources will be used as incentives for the  TESDA-administered  institutions  to\nequip  and  prepare  themselves  for  the  devolution  process  and  to  become  more  independent\nfinancially.\n\n78.\nTESDA  will  develop  devolution  plans  for  the  58  training  institutions  that  it  now\nadministers. Initially, however, 25 project institutions have been identified for support based on\nmanagement  capacity,  location  in  the  growth  centers,  existing  programs  and  resources,\npotential development, and the needs of the communities. The 25 institutions will be upgraded\nto become \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d in specified fields (Appendix 4). Support is conditional upon\nthe  acceptance  of  the  devolution  plan  and  the  agreement  between  TESDA  and  the  recipient\nagency.  Once  a devolution  plan has  been  agreed  upon  with  the LGUs  or  other  agencies,  the\ngovernance  and  management of these  centers  will  be  strengthened  to  prepare  for  and  assist\nthe  transfer  of  the  institutions.  Additional  facilities  such  as  classrooms,  workshops,  and\nlaboratories  and,  in  some  cases,  buildings,  equipment,  and  instructional  materials  to  support\ncontextual learning in the sciences, mathematics, technology, and technical skills training will be\nprovided.  The  Project  will  finance  the  needed  civil  works,  equipment,  staff  development,\ninstructional materials, and courseware for the institutions.\n\nCurrently, TESDA administers 45 small provincial training centers through its provincial\n79.\noffices. Most of the centers are in remote or rural areas and provide basic training facilities and\nopportunities to the poor rural population. Some centers were established with donations of land\nor basic facilities from the local communities or LGUs with central government support for their\noperation  and  maintenance.  The  programs  offered  generally  include  garment  making  and\nsewing,  automechanics,  training  for  electricians,  and  basic  electronics.  These  centers  will  be\nprovided modest facilities, improvement funds, and basic training equipment and tools to enable\nthem  to  expand  services  to  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  clients.  LGUs,  other  government\nagencies, and the communities will work closely with TESDA in preparing a development plan,\nincluding  management,  supervision,  and  financing  of  the  activities  upon  the  transfer  of  the\n\n\f20\n\nfacilities  and  resources  to  the  LGUs  and  communities.  The  Project  will  finance  necessary\nrenovations in civil works and training equipment.\n\n80.\nEach  project  institution  will  be  required  to  prepare  an  institutional  development  and\ndevolution  plan,  including  a  reasonable  schedule  for  achieving  self-sufficiency.  Public\ninstitutions  will  be  upgraded  upon  the  formalization  of  the  development  and  devolution  plans\nwith  the  LGUs  concerned.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  devolved  institutions  will  be  allowed  to\nmanage  their  own  academic and financial affairs,  and  retain  incomes  and  earnings  from  their\nactivities and assets to support their programs. TESDA will closely cooperate with LGUs, other\ngovernment  agencies,  NGOs,  the  communities,  and  the  private  sector  in  developing  and\nimplementing  the devolution  plans,  with a definite  time frame for  each  project  institution. With\nacceptance of the devolution plan and the readiness of the parties concerned, pilot programs for\ndevolution of the selected institutions among the 45 provincial training centers, as well as the 25\nupgraded institutions, are expected to be implemented within the life of the Project.\n\n3. \n\nStrengthening the Capacity of Private TESD Providers\n\n81.\nThe third objective of the Project is to enhance the quality and coverage of private skills\ntraining. Private providers supply about 80 percent of all skills training at present. This is one of\nthe clear strengths of the system because private providers tend to be more closely linked to the\njob market and save substantial public resources. However, the quality and coverage of private\nprovision are limited by lack of access to capital, which constrains the potential contribution  of\nprivate  providers  to  the  sector.  The  Project  will  give  private  providers  access  to  a  financing\nfacility  for  quality  improvement  by  creating  the  Fund  for  Technical  Education  and  Skills\nDevelopment  (FTESD)  from  which  qualified  private  training  institutions  could  borrow.  The\nFTESD  will  be  open  to  all  private  training  institutions  on  a  competitive  basis.  Interested\ninstitutions can submit a project proposal showing the purposes for which the funds will be used\nand  justifying  those  uses  in  terms  of  improving  the  quality  of  their  TESD  programs.  The\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP) will administer the FTESD and ensure repayment.\nThe  criteria for  allocating funds  include, among others,  relevance  of  the  proposed  program  to\npriority  economic  requirements  (e.g.,  information  technology,  engineering  technology,  food\ntechnology, tourism, etc.), technical and financial feasibility, and efficiency in the proposed use\nof  funds,  financial  soundness  of  the  institution,  and  geographic  location.  Borrowers  will  be\nrequired  to  enter  into  a  process  of  quality  upgrading  leading  to  full  accreditation  by  TESDA.\nDetails of DBP are in Appendix 11.\n\nMinimum  and  maximum  amounts  are  expected  to  range  from  $25,000  to  $500,000.  A\n82.\npreliminary survey of private schools shows that most subloans will be in the range of $75,000-\n$250,000.  They  could  be  used  for  staff  development,  instructional  materials,  equipment,  and\nupgrading/expansion of physical facilities. The terms of the subloans will include, among others,\na loan amount of up to 80 percent of total project costs, grace period of 6-24 months, maximum\nterms  of  10  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  11.5-14.0  percent,  to  be  fixed  in  accordance  with\nmarket conditions at the time of approval, and a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount. In\na feasibility study conducted by  DBP and  TESDA  in  1999,  private providers expressed  strong\ninterest  in  borrowing  money  from  the  FTESD  under  those  conditions.  More  than  150  of  the\nsurveyed  institutions  indicated  a  willingness and  intent  to  apply  for  financing  from  the  FTESD\nonce  it  is  established  (Appendix  5).  It  is  expected  that  about  100-120  institutions  will  receive\nloans under the Project.\n\n\f21\n\n4.\n\nEnhancing Equity in Skills Acquisition\n\n83.\nOne consequence of the heavy reliance on private institutions for skills development  is\nthat the burden for financing the training falls on the students and trainees. Private institutions\ntypically  earmark  about  5  percent  of  tuition  revenues  for  scholarships.  Still,  many  potential\ntrainees  cannot  afford  the  direct  costs.  The  fourth  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  reduce\npoverty through better acquisition of skills for income generation among the poor. Through the\nestablishment of a scholarship fund (SF) and a student loan fund (SLF), the Project will assist\ndisadvantaged groups to receive and complete skills training.\n\na. \n\nScholarship Fund\n\nThe  Project  will  establish  an  SF  of  $6.5  million  to  provide  poor  students  with  financial\n84.\nassistance  to  attend  formal  and  nonformal  skills  training  in  public  and  private  institutions\n(Appendix  6).  TESDA  will  administer  the  SF  and  make  disbursements  through  its  depository\nbank, Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP). LBP has a wide network of branches throughout the\ncountry .\n\n85.\nTESD  students  enrolled  in  priority  fields  such  as  engineering-related  subjects,\ninformation  technology,  construction,  tourism,  foods,  and  agriculture  in  formal  and  nonformal\nprograms in public and private institutions\u2014and from families below the official poverty line are\neligible to apply for scholarships at the schools where they want to enroll. TESDA will allocate\nthe assistance to the provincial offices, which, in turn, will allocate it to the recipients based on\napplications from the training institutions. This is the procedure currently followed in the award\nof PESFA scholarships to poor students. The school will evaluate the eligibility of the students\nand determine the amount to be awarded to each. Scholarships will be a maximum of P14,500\nper student per year and may be applied to tuition, books and  materials, and  living  expenses.\nThe school will decide, in consultation with the students and their parents/guardians, the priority\nneeds of the students and the allowances needed to cover their living expenses.\n\n86.\nEnrollees  in  nonformal  TESD  programs  will  be  given  the  scholarship  only  once  to\ncomplete the program. For formal programs that require full-time studies leading to a certificate\nor  diploma  below  the  degree  level,  the  support  may  be  extended  after  the  first  year  until  the\nstudent  completes  the  program  provided  progress  is  satisfactory  and  completion  is  within  a\nmaximum  of  three  years.  The  school  will  be  required  to  submit  a  report  on  student  academic\nperformance to TESDA every term. Approximately 20,000 students/trainees will benefit from the\nSF. The Government will also continue to support student assistance under the PESFA program\nat least at the 1999 levels throughout the project period.\n\nb.\n\nStudent Loan Fund\n\n87.\nScholarship  grants  have  the  advantage  of  targeting  the  poorest  students  but  the\ndisadvantage of not being readily sustainable. Once the grant fund is exhausted, there may be\nno  replenishment  even  though  there  will  be  a  continuing  demand  for  some  form  of  financial\nsupport for  the  poorest  students.  In  addition,  while  scholarship  grants  target  the  poorest,  they\nare  not  necessarily  appropriate  for  the  needs  of  the  borderline  poor,  that  is,  students  from\nfamilies whose income is too high to qualify the students for a scholarship grant but too low to\nenable them to pursue technical or vocational studies. Scholarship grants have the  advantage\nof being relatively simple to administer since repayment is not a factor, while loan funds, which\nrecycle resources, are associated with a certain amount of risk.\n\n\f22\n\nthe  risks  (e.g.,  defaults, \n\nThe  Government  recognizes \n\n88.\ntargeting  efficiency,  and\nadministrative  costs),  but  is  still  concerned  with  the  high  cost  and  nonsustainability  of\nscholarship grants. To develop an equitable higher education finance system based largely on\nuser fees and cost recovery, an experimental student loan scheme will be developed under the\nproject. Loans will be available to students who come from low-income families and are enrolled\nin public and private institutions. The loan will enable such students to undertake TESD training.\nThe  loan  fund  will  be  implemented  in  such  a  way  as  to  maximize  experimentation  and\nmonitoring  with  the  objective  of  carefully  analyzing  its  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  Based  on\nmonitoring results, the implementation arrangements, eligibility criteria,  repayment  procedures,\netc., will be strengthened to facilitate longer term institutionalization.\n\n89.\nA  Student  Loan  Fund  (SLF)  of  $1.5  million  will  be  established  to  support  nonpoor  but\nneedy  students  who  are  enrolled  in  registered  or  accredited  priority  TESD  programs  and\nspecialized short-term training leading to a certificate or diploma  below degree  level  in  private\nand  public  institutions.  The  priority  programs  include  engineering  and  manufacturing-related\nsubjects, communications, information technology, electronics, tourism, agriculture and fishery,\nfoods, and maritime studies.\n\nQualified applicants and full-time students enrolled in registered or accredited programs\n90.\nin  public  and  private  institutions  who  meet  the  income  criterion  are  eligible  to  apply  for  an\neducational loan through their institutions. To enable as many students to benefit from the SLF,\nthe maximum loan size will be limited to P15,000 per year.\n\n91.\nSeveral  models  of  student  loan  programs  have  been  implemented  in  both  developed\nand developing countries including the Philippines. To ensure the effectiveness and viability of\nthe  student  loan  program  under  the  Project,  consulting  services  will  assist  in  formulating  and\nimplementing  the  SLF.  TESDA  will  make  the  necessary  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for\neffective  implementation  of  the  SLF.  The  SLF  is  expected  to  become  fully  operational  in  the\nsecond year of the Project. It will be closely monitored and its success and impact assessed by\nADB and TESDA. If the program proves successful, the Government and ADB may expand it,\nprovided that project resources are available.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  to  be  implemented  by  TESDA  is  estimated  at  $70  million\n92.\nequivalent,  of  which  $27.34  million  (39.1  percent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  including  the\n$4.01 million  service  charge  on  the  proposed  loan.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at\n$42.66 million  (60.9  percent  equivalent).  A  summary  is  shown  in  Table 1,  and  details  are  in\nAppendix 7.\n\n\f23\n\nTable 1: Project Costs\n($ million)\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nExchange Currency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nComponent\n\nA.

Contingencies\nC.\n\nD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide (i) a loan of $25 million to the Republic of the Philippines\n93.\nfor  TESDP,  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  Y2,166,700,000  to  DBP  for  the  FTESD.  The  loan  to  the\nGovernment will finance 34.16 percent of the foreign exchange cost  and  36.7  percent of  local\ncurrency  cost.  It  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5\nyears,  with an  interest  rate  determined  in accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending\nrate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum.  The\nGovernment will  pay to ADB a front-end fee in an amount equal to one percent of the loan. The\nfee  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan.  The  Government  will  provide  a  counterpart  budget  of  $20\nmillion equivalent for local currency costs. The financing arrangements are summarized in Table\n2 and shown in detail in Appendix 7.\n\nThe  ADB  loan  of  $25  million  to  the  Government  will  finance,  among  others,  the\n94.\nScholarship  Fund  ($6.5  million)  and  the  Student  Loan  Fund  ($1.5  million),  in-country  staff\ndevelopment  programs  ($3.23  million)  and  other  smaller  items  for  which  expenses  are  in  the\nlocal currency. Hence, the ratio of local currency to foreign currency costs appears rather high,\nbut it is justified by the nature of the expenses involved.\n\n95.\nThe  Government  has  obtained  parallel  cofinancing  from  Nordic  Development  Fund\n(NDF) for SDR6 million or $8 million equivalent (11.4 percent of the Project cost)41 for purchase\nof  equipment  and  instructional  materials,  and  from  Danish  International  Development  Agency\n\n                                               \n41 NDF\u2019s  credit  carries  no  interest,  but  has  0.75  percent  service  charge  and  0.5  percent  commitment  fee  with\n\n40 years maturity including 10 years grace period.\n\n\f24\n\n(DANIDA) ($10 million or 14.3 percent of the Project cost)42 for procurement of equipment and\ninstructional materials. In addition, the OPEC Fund for International Development will provide a\nloan  of  $7  million  equivalent43  to  finance  100  percent  of  civil  works  for  all  project  institutions\nincluding upgrading of multimedia facilities at TESDA headquarters.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\u2014TESDA Loan\n($ million)\n\n    Source\n\nADB\nNordic Development Fund\nOPEC Fund\nDANIDA\nGovernment of the Philippines\n\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost Percent\n\n9.34\n8.00\n0\n10.00\n0\n\n27.34\n\n15.66\n0\n7.00\n0\n20.00\n\n25.00\n8.00\n7.00\n10.00\n20.00\n\n35.7\n11.4\n10.0\n14.3\n28.6\n\n42.66\n\n70.00\n\n100.0\n\n96.\nThe  ADB  loan  to  DBP  of  Y2,166,700,000  will  be  from  the  market-based  loan  window\nwith government guarantee to set up the FTESD for onlending to private TESD institutions. The\nloan to DBP will have an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace  period  of  5 years,\nand  a  commitment  charge of  0.75  percent per annum.  It  will  have  a fixed  interest  rate for  the\nfirst ten years, with an option to covert to a floating rate on the tenth year. DBP will pay to ADB a\nfront-end fee in an amount equal to one percent of the loan amount. The fee will be capitalized\nin the loan. To ensure the financial viability of the DBP loan and sound financial management, it\nis agreed that DBP will maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10 percent and a minimum\nreturn on average total assets of 0.3 percent for every year of the project life.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nExecuting Agencies\n\n97.\nThe Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) will implement the\nTESD  Project.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  within  TESDA  will  manage  day-to-day\nactivities.  The  director  general  of  TESDA  will  act  as  project  director  and  chairperson  of  the\nproject advisory committee (PAC). A full-time project manager will coordinate the PMO activities\nand  oversee  project  implementation  through  the  TESDA  regional  and  provincial  offices.  The\nexisting  central,  regional,  and  provincial  offices  will  act  as  project  implementation  units  to\nsupervise and coordinate implementation activities in their respective regions and provinces.\n\n98.\nDBP will administer the FTESD. DBP will assign a team of qualified staff at headquarters\nto  manage  the  FTESD.   Private  TESD   institutions,    with   accredited   TESD  programs   or\n\n                                               \n42 DANIDA\u2019s mixed credit program carries a management fee of maximum 3/8 percent (flat) and a commitment fee of\nmaximum  0.25  percent  per  annum  on  the  undisbursed  loan  amount.  Loan  repayment  will  be  made  in  equal,\nsemiannual installments normally starting six months after commissioning.\n\n43 The  OPEC loan  carries  2  percent interest  per  annum  with  1  percent  service  charge  on  amounts  withdrawn  and\n\noutstanding, with 20 years maturity including a 5-year grace period.\n\n\f25\n\ncommitments to register their programs for accreditation purposes, can apply for a loan at any\nDBP lending  outlet.  DBP  will  use  the  approved  criteria  to  evaluate  the application and ensure\nfull transparency and equity in the evaluation and approval of the applications, and in use of the\nloan funds. Withdrawals  in amounts  of  no  less  than  the  yen equivalent of $1,000,000  may be\nmade  by  DBP  on  any  of  the  following  regular  withdrawal  dates,  15  March,  15  June,  15\nSeptember, and 15 December. Withdrawals in the yen equivalent of $2,000,000 or more may be\nmade on days other than the regular  withdrawal dates.  Close  monitoring by  TESDA and  DBP\nwill ensure proper use of the loan funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan.\nDetails on the selection procedures and criteria, terms and conditions, and repayment scheme\nare in Appendix 5.\n\n2.\n\nProject Advisory Committee\n\n99.\nPAC,  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  TESDA,  will  be  established  to  provide  policy\ndirection, guidance,  support and  monitor  project  activities  to  ensure  that  the  Project  responds\neffectively  to  the  needs  of  all  stakeholders.  The  committee  will  comprise  representatives  of\nTESDA;  Department  of  Science  and  Technology;  Commission  on  Higher  Education;\nDepartment  of  Budget  Management,  Department  of  Education,  Culture  and  Sports  (DECS);\nDepartment  of  Finance;  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority;  DBP;  associations  of\nprivate industry; NGOs; and TESD providers.\n\n3. \n\nSchedule\n\n100.\n\nThe Project will be implemented over five and a half years (Appendix 8).\n\n4. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n101. All ADB and OPEC Fund-financed goods and services will be procured following ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  for  Procurement  dated  February  1999.  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)\nprocedures  will  be  applied  for  supply  contracts  for  goods  and  services  estimated  to  cost  the\nequivalent of $500,000 or more. Supply contracts for courseware, instructional and educational\nmaterials and packages  with a  value  of  less than  $500,000  equivalent  will  follow  international\nshopping  (IS)  procedures.  Small  contracts  for  minor  items  with  a  value  less  than  $100,000\nequivalent  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase  (DP).  In  accordance  with  para.  3.09  of  the\nGuidelines,  DBP  will  require  each  subborrower  of  the  FTESD  to  demonstrate  that  the\nprocurement  procedures  adopted  for  goods  and  services  as  well  as  for  goods  for  lease\ninvestments  are  appropriate.  DBP  will  also  require  each  subborrower  to  ensure  and  certify  to\nADB  that  the goods  and  services  to  be financed by  such  subloans  will  be  supplied  from,  and\nproduced  in  member  countries  of  ADB,  and  purchased  at  a  reasonable  price,  account  being\ntaken of other  relevant factors  such as time of delivery,  efficiency  and  reliability  of  the  goods,\ntheir suitability for the subproject and the availability of  maintenance facilities  and  spare  parts,\nand,  in  the  case  of  services,  their  quality  and  the  competence  of  the  parties  rendering  them.\nProcurement  under  cofinancing  arrangements  will  follow  the  agreements  between  ADB,  the\ncofinanciers, and the Government.\n\na. \n\nCivil Works\n\n102. All civil works under the Project will be financed by a loan of $7 million equivalent from\nthe  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development.  ADB  will  administer  the  OPEC  loan  in\naccordance with the Letter of Administration to be entered into between ADB and OPEC Fund.\n\n\f26\n\nAll civil works contracts for  the  project public  institutions  will  be awarded  on the  basis of  local\ncompetitive bidding under ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n\nb. \n\nEquipment, Vehicles, Furniture, and Instructional Materials\n\n103. All  procurement  of  equipment,  vehicles,  furniture,  courseware,  instructional  materials,\nand consumable materials to be funded from the proceeds of the ADB loan to the Government\nwill follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Supply contracts for goods estimated to cost the\nequivalent of $500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  ICB.  Supply  contracts  with  a\ntotal estimated value of $500,000 or less will follow IS procedures, except for supply contracts\nwith  a  value  of  less  than  $100,000  equivalent,  which  may  be  procured  by  DP.  Details  of\nprocurement packages and  technical  specifications  will be submitted for  ADB  approval  before\nthe start of the procurement process. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 9.\n\nc. \n\nConsulting Services\n\nThe Project provides consulting services of 176 person-months: 65 international and 111\n104.\ndomestic.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  through  a  firm  or  as  individuals  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB for the  engagement of  domestic  consultants  (Appendix  3,  Table  A3).  The\nGovernment will provide office space, secretarial support, local transportation, and other support\nservices as necessary and appropriate.\n\nd. \n\nStaff Development Programs\n\n105.\nInternational and in-country fellowship training programs will be provided to upgrade the\nskills, knowledge, and experience of qualified individuals  who  will  be  involved  in  implementing\nthe project components and activities and in the development of TESD. Staff from private TESD\ninstitutions under the Project will be included in relevant in-country training programs. Staff from\nprivate institutions will be nominated by their respective institutions to TESDA. Course fees and\nother  expenses  will  be  waived  for  these  teachers,  but  the  sponsoring  institutions  will  be\nresponsible  for  incidental  expenses  the  staff  incur  in  attending  the  training  programs.\nInternational short-term training will focus on specialized subjects related to the programs to be\nimplemented  under  the  Project.  To  the  extent  possible,  training  venues  will  be  selected  from\namong  qualified  institutions  and  organizations  in  the  regional  member  countries  of  ADB.  The\nGovernment  will  follow  the  criteria  agreed  upon  with  ADB  on  the  award  of  international\nfellowships.  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of  (i)  the  nominated  candidates,  (ii)  their\nqualifications,  (iii) nominated  institutions  and  agencies,  and  (iv) detailed  cost  of  the  proposed\ncourses.  ADB  approval  will  be  required  prior  to  the  award  of  international  fellowships.  The\nGovernment  will  implement  a bonding  arrangement  to  ensure  that  after  the  completion  of  the\ntraining  program  the  fellowship  recipients  will  remain  in  the  service  of  the  Government  for  a\nminimum  period of  twice  the  length  of  the  training.  Private  TESD  institutions  shall  adopt  their\nappropriate policy and procedures to ensure utilization and retention of the trained staff. Details\nof the staff development programs are in Appendix C.\n\n5. \n\nAccounts, Reports, and Audits\n\n106.\nThe  TESDA  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and  submit\nthem to ADB  within  30  days  after  each  quarter.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format  acceptable  to\nADB  and  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  the  progress  made  against  established  targets,\nproblems encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to be taken to resolve\n\n\f27\n\nproblems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the\nsucceeding quarter. Within three months after the physical completion of the Project, PMO will\nsubmit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  of  project  implementation,\naccomplishments, benefits, and impact.\n\n107. Separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with\nsound accounting principles. They will specify the expenditures for all activities and  identify  all\nexpenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan. Project accounts, including financial\nstatements, statement of expenditures, and imprest account records, will be audited annually by\nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  auditors\u2019  report  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and\nrelated  financial  statements,  including  the  auditors\u2019  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  on\ncompliance with loan covenants, and on the use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement\nof expenditures procedures, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than six months after\nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\n108. Borrowers  from  the  FTESD  will  submit  progress  reports  on  their  project  to  DBP\nsemiannually.  For  its  part,  DBP  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  reports  on  the  status  of  the\nimplementation of the FTESD.\n\n6. \n\nDisbursement\n\n109. All disbursements under the ADB loan will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nTo  expedite  disbursements,  after  loan  effectiveness  the  Government  will  establish  an  imprest\naccount through TESDA at Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The imprest account, with a ceiling of\n$1.5 million, will be utilized for eligible expenditures for equipment and materials financed under\nthe  Project,  the  SF,  and  the  SLF.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,\nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook dated\nJune  1996  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Borrower  and  ADB.  For\nsmaller  expenditures,  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  used.  Any  individual\npayment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the statement of expenditure procedures will not\nexceed $20,000 or any other amount as may be agreed upon subsequently by the Government\nand ADB. The SF and SLF will be used to provide funds to be deposited with the Land Bank of\nthe Philippines for disbursement to the scholars and the schools upon instructions from TESDA.\nThe imprest account and  statement  of expenditures  are  audited  as  part of  the  annual audit  in\naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan  Agreement  and  ADB\u2019s  Financial Reporting and\nAuditing of Projects.  A  separate  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  accounts  and\nstatements of expenditures should be included in the annual audit report.\n\n7. \n\nProject Performance\n\na. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n110. A wide range of indicators have been identified as part of the project framework to serve\nas criteria for evaluating the success and impact of the Project. They include the passing rate in\nthe  national  skills  standard  certification  examinations  of  students  in  project  institutions,  job\nplacement of graduates, number of students/applicants going through the equivalency system,\nnumber of TESD programs and institutions accredited, provision of better training opportunities\nfor the poor and access to the TESD programs, and number of trainees assisted. The indicators\nwill form part of the benefit and monitoring system, which is a component of the overall project\nperformance management system.\n\n\f28\n\n111. Monitoring and evaluation of the Project will review the timeliness and quality of project\ninputs  delivered,  the  process  by  which  the  project  institutions  translate  the  project  inputs  into\nimprovements in the teaching-learning process, student learning outcomes, and the process of\nenhancing management and supervisory capacity and practices at the local and school levels.\n\n112. Baseline data for all project institutions will be collected in the first year of the Project to\nform  part  of  the  TESD  EMIS  at  the  central  and  local  levels.  Standard  monitoring  forms  for\nTESDA  and  the  project  institutions  will  be  developed  and  used  as  instruments  for  assessing\nproject progress and achievements.\n\n113.\nThe  success  of  the  FTESD  will  be  determined  by  the  number  and  amount  of  loans\nextended  to  private  institutions,  the  utilization  rate,  the  benefits  to  students,  and  the  rate  of\nrepayments of the loans.\n\nb. \n\nPeriodic Review and Midterm Review\n\n114. ADB will closely monitor progress through a review of the quarterly progress reports and\nregular review missions. In addition, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken by the\nGovernment and ADB upon completion of the third year of the Project, or at any other time as\nmay  be  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  to  assess  project  progress  and\nachievements  compared  with  its  objectives  and  targets,  identify  any  difficulties  encountered,\nand recommend remedial measures.\n\n115. Particular  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  the  successful  implementation  by  TESDA  and\nDBP and acceptance by private and public TESD training institutions, industries and the public\nof  a  number  of  initiatives  such  as  assessment  and  accreditation  of  programs  delivered  by\nprivate  institutions,  scholarship  fund,  student  loan  fund,  the  loan  facility  for  private  TESD\ninstitutions,  industry  participation  initiatives,  and  curricula  and  training  of  trainers  programs\nmade available to private TESD institutions.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agencies\n\nThe  Technical  Education  Skills  Development  Authority  will  be  the  Executing  Agency\n\n116.\n(EA) for the TESD Project. Development Bank of the Philippines will be the EA for the FTESD.\n\n117.\nTESDA,  although  relatively  new  as  a  government  agency,  has  experienced  staff  who\ntransferred  from  the  Bureau  of  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  under  DECS,  National\nManpower  and  Youth  Council,  and  Department  of  Labor  and  Employment.  Some  staff  have\nexperience  in  implementing  foreign-assisted  projects.  The  recently  completed  World  Bank\nSecond  Vocational  Training  Project  has  proven  TESDA  to  be  an  effective  implementation\nagency with strong leadership and committed staff at all levels. Overall, it has the capacity and\nqualified staff to implement the TESD Project.\n\n118. As a  major development finance  institution,  DBP  has  wide experience  in  administering\nsimilar funds for the social sector. It has administered loans under the Social Security System of\nthe Philippines for the benefit of private schools. It also manages other financing facilities for the\n\n\f29\n\nprivate  sector.  DBP  has  implemented  three  ADB-financed  project44  and  will  assign  a  team  of\nqualified  and  experienced  staff  to  manage  the  FTESD.  A  postevaluation  of  the  third  project\ncompleted in 1999 found that DBP had exhibited strong financial performance and  adhered  to\nprudential financial management practices.45 DBP also has an extensive network of branches to\ncater to the needs of private schools in the provinces.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n119.\nThe environmental implications of the Project were reviewed and no significant adverse\nenvironmental  impacts  were  identified.  The  Project  has  been  classified  under  environmental\ncategory C. TESDA will ensure that the upgrading, expansion, renovation and operation of the\nschool  facilities  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure  Development  Projects  and  relevant  environmental  procedures.  Standard\noperation  procedures  for  the  use  and  discharge  of  chemical  substances  in  the  schools\u2019\nlaboratories will be developed to prevent adverse environmental impacts. All new curricula will\nbe  identified  and  reviewed  to  ensure  the  proper  incorporation  of  environmental  management\nconcerns.\n\n2. \n\nInitial Social Analysis\n\n120.\nThe Project was designed to address social issues in three major areas. First, it will help\nincrease  equity  and  access  to  TESD  institutions  and  programs  among  the  poor  through\nexpanded training opportunities especially in the rural areas, and provision of training programs\nrelevant to the needs of industries and communities. Second, through scholarships and student\nloan funds, students from low-income families can avail themselves of opportunities to enroll in\nTESD  programs  of  their  choice  in  private  and  public  institutions.  Third,  the  Project  will  utilize\nTESD  institutions,  especially  those  in  rural  areas,  as  a  vehicle  to  promote  local  economic\ndevelopment activities through various training programs.\n\n121.\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  the  role  of  women  in  the  country\u2019s\neconomic and  social development. Building on  the newly developed programs  at  the  National\nVocational  Training  and  Development  Center  for  Women  under  TESDA,  the  technology-\noriented trade training programs will be expanded to give more opportunities to women across\nthe  country.  Career  counseling  and  job  placement  services  to  be  established  in  TESD\ninstitutions will help women, the poor, and minority groups find employment in their fields.\n\n122.\nThe  social  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  monitored  through  (i)  enrollment  and\nachievement  patterns  in  public  and  private  TESD  institutions;  (ii)  success  rates  of  the  target\ngroups in aggregate and by region; (iii) success rate and employment patterns of the recipients\nof  scholarships;  (iv)  employment  rates  of  graduates;  and  (v)  average  salaries  and  starting\nemployment positions of the graduates from various programs. (Detailed social assessment is in\nAppendix B.)\n\n                                               \n44 Loan 247-PHI: Development Bank of the Philippines,  for  $25  million,  approved  on  9  December  1975;  Loan  321-\nPHI: Second Development Bank of the Philippines, for  $35  million,  approved  on  29  November  1977; and Loan\n1088-PHI: Third Development Bank of the Philippines, for $100 million, approved on 16 July 1991.\n\n45 PPA: PHI 24112: Third Development Bank of the Philippines. December 1999.\n\n\fH.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n30\n\n123. ADB  will  provide  TA  to  assist  the  Government  in  strengthening  the  management\ncapacity  of  TESDA  and  a  network  of  regional  and  provincial  institutions  including  LGUs,  to\nenable them  to provide effective  leadership and  support  to  public and private  institutions.  The\nTA will contribute directly to the improvement of the quality of TESD programs, which in turn will\nproduce  a  qualified  skilled  workforce  whose  higher  productivity  will  enhance  the  country\u2019s\ncompetitiveness in the global market.\n\n124.\nThe TA consists of three major components: (i) strengthening the management capacity\nof  TESDA  and  its  network  of  regional  and  provincial  institutions  and  LGUs;  (ii)  improving  the\nquality  of  TESD  programs  through  the  development  and  implementation  of  accreditation\nsystems,  quality  assurance  programs,  dual  training  systems,  apprenticeship  systems;  and\n(iii) enhancing the employment opportunities of TESD graduates through the institutionalization\nof  career  guidance  and  counseling  services,  job  placement  and  support  services,  industry-\ninstitution linkages, and entrepreneurship development programs in TESDA institutions.\n\n125.\nThe  TA  will  provide  16  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  34  person-\nmonths of domestic consultants and will be  implemented over 18  months.  The estimated  total\ncost  is  $1,115,000  equivalent,  of  which  $495,000  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $620,000\nequivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide  $775,000  covering  the  entire  foreign\nexchange cost and $280,000 equivalent of the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  meet\nthe  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $340,000  equivalent,  which  represents  expenditures  (in\ncash or in kind) for the remuneration of counterpart staff, office space, production of documents,\nlocal  transportation,  and  other  administrative  expenses.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant\nbasis from  the Asian  Currency  Crisis  Support  Facility,  provided  by  the  Government  of  Japan.\nAppendix 10 gives TA details, cost estimates, and financing plan.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n126.\nThe Project responds to the requirements for competitiveness and equity; addresses key\nweaknesses in the present TESD system, supports the implementation of well-conceived plans\nfor  skills  development,  takes  into  account  lessons  from  previous  assistance,  conforms  with\nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  education  policies,  finances  soundly  designed  components  of  a\nclear  project  strategy,  and  incorporates  feasible  financing  and  implementation  plans.  More\nspecific justification is given in the following paragraphs.\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Justification\n\n127. Economic  analysis  determined  the  economic  viability  and  return  on  investment  for  the\nProject. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 14.6 percent, which is above ADB\u2019s\nstandard  economic opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12 percent.  Sensitivity  tests  (with  10  percent\nincrease or decrease in project benefits) show a reduced internal rate of return of 11.6 percent.\nThe Project is viable from the national economic perspective (Appendix D).\n\nB. \n\nRationalization of the Skills Development System\n\n128.\nTESDA  will  be  strengthened  and  focused  to  develop  policies,  occupational  standards,\nand  curricula;  pursue  staff  development;  and  evaluate/disseminate  information  on  the\nperformance  of  the  system.  These  functions  are  properly  those  of  the  public  sector  and  the\ncentral TESD coordinating agency. Assistance in these areas is justified by its multiplier effect\n\n\f31\n\nthrough  relatively  small  investments.  This  is  especially  true  for  badly  needed  quality\nimprovements. The Project will facilitate the implementation of a  well-conceived  system  where\nemployers drive the development of competency standards and skills acquisition through testing\nand  certification.  In  total,  about 175,000  TESD  trainees  will  receive  improved  training  through\nTESDA\u2019s activities in course improvement, instructional materials, and staff development. These\nquality  improvements  are  expected  to  result  in  significant  increases\u2014on  the  order  of\n20 percent\u2014on the currently low pass rates in national skills examinations.\n\nThe project public training institutions will be devolved to LGUs, the communities, NGOs,\n129.\nor  local  institutions.  This benefits  the  system  through  better  linkages  with  local  labor  markets,\ngreater private resource mobilization, and consequent reductions in dependence on government\nfinancing. In this context, investments in upgrading public institutions can be justified by the fact\nthat these institutions offer types of courses not normally given by private providers, and by the\neventual cost savings on the government budgets realized through possible increased user fees\nand  other \ninterventions  such  as  adoption  of\ncompetency-based curricula and staff training are expected to stimulate major improvements in\nquality.  About  8,650  teachers  and  administrators  from  both  public  and  private  institutions  will\nbenefit  from  staff  development  programs.  The  assistance  is  expected  to  increase  the\neffectiveness and relevance of  instruction  greatly.  This,  in  turn,  is  projected  to  reduce  dropout\nrates and increase the employability of graduates (Appendix D).\n\nincome-generating  activities.  Moreover, \n\n130. Private training institutions have fewer constraints on their ability to improve and expand\nservice offerings. Private providers have better linkages with the job market and lower cost per\ngraduate than public institutions do, and their beneficiaries absorb virtually all costs. Support for\nprivate institutions through the FTESD is justified by the present constraints that impede access\nto necessary financing for  improvements  and  expansion  of  private  training.  About  120  private\ntraining institutions will benefit from this component. In addition, their staff will be able to access\nstaff  development  programs,  curricula,  and  teaching  materials  (at  cost)  from  TESDA.  This\nrepresents  a  significant  policy  shift,  in  which  the  role  of  government  is  seen  as  providing\nassistance to all parts of the system, regardless of ownership.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n131.\nThe  Project  is  also  justified  by  its  expected  contribution  to  poverty  reduction.  TESD\ninstitutions  have  been  found  to  enroll  a  high  proportion  of  students  from  low-income  families.\nThe least financially able of these groups will qualify for scholarships and educational loans to\nbe provided under the Project. At least 25,000 students will complete their training with financial\nsupport  from  the  SF  and  the  SLF.  Investment  in  public  TESD  institutions  is  also  justified  in\nrelation to  the  prevailing  subsidies  received  by  general  secondary and  postsecondary  schools\nwhose  clientele  for  the  most  part  represents  families  with  higher  household  incomes.  In\nsummary, the Project is justified by its contributions to improve equity to TESD among the poor.\nIt  will  ensure  completion  of  training  and  acquisition  of  income-generating  skills  for  sizable\nnumbers of low-income trainees.\n\nD.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n132.\nThe Project is designed to improve the quality of the technical workforce and to enhance\nequitable  access  and  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  acquire  employable  skills.  In  addition  to\nimproving the quality of the TESD system as a whole, the Project will strengthen and enhance\ntraining facilities and resources in all 13 regions of the country. It will provide scholarships and\nloans to approximately 25,000 low income students, particularly women, to avail themselves of\n\n\f32\n\nTESD training opportunities. The Project will strengthen linkages between TESD institutions and\nprivate  businesses  and  industries.  It  will  also  help  institutionalize  career  guidance  and  job\nplacement services in the project institutions. These support services will help TESD graduates\nfind  appropriate  employment.  The  EMIS,  to  be  further  strengthened  under  the  Project,  will\nenable TESD institutions to plan and manage their programs effectively. The EMIS  will  further\nensure that relevant training is provided to support a good match between the demand for and\nsupply  of  appropriate  skills  in  the  localities.  Overall,  the  Project  directly  addresses  poverty\nissues among the poor who are the main clients and beneficiaries of the TESD system.\n\n133.\nIncremental benefits that will accrue to poor workers can be measured in terms of higher\nincome. Without the benefit of training, poor workers are  inclined  to  receive  wages  lower  than\nthe  nominal  minimum  wage  rate  of  $4.95  equivalent  per  day.  TESDA  studies  show  that  with\ntraining, these workers are in a better position to get at least the minimum wage and higher in\nmost  cases.  The potential  income  of  the project  beneficiaries  would thus  range  from  $6.44  to\n$9.90 equivalent per day. With additional skills and knowledge, those who will be self-employed\nor  entrepreneurs  can  earn  higher  incomes.  The  financial  impact  of  the  Project  on  the\nbeneficiaries is relatively greater because the majority are unemployed or underemployed, and\nhave little or no forgone income during the training period. For them, the quality of life is likely to\nbe  improved.  In  addition,  staff  development  programs  will  enhance  the  marketability  of  the\ntrainers and will help improve their incomes.\n\n134.\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  can  be  assessed  on  the  following  criteria:\n(i) number of students/trainees from families below the official poverty line enrolled in public and\nprivate  TESD  institutions;  (ii)  the  gender  ratio  of  students/trainees  in  TESD  programs;  (iii)\nnumber and ratio of TESD students from the disadvantaged and minority groups; (iv) number of\npoor  who  receive  scholarships  and  educational  loans  to  attend  TESD  institutions  under  the\nProject; (v) number of TESD graduates employed or self-employed, their occupations, and their\nincome levels after graduation, particularly the poor who received scholarships; and (vi) number\nof  graduates  who  find  better  jobs  and  employment  opportunities,  or  start  their  own  business\nenterprises that help create jobs and generate employment in the communities.\n\n135.\nThe impact of the Project on poverty reduction will  be  closely  monitored and assessed\nthrough  the benefit  monitoring and evaluation  system  to  be  developed  under  the  Project.  The\nproject  impact  will  be  measured  on  the  basis  of  national  and  provincial  poverty  incidence.\nImpact  tracer  studies  will  also  assess  the  overlap  of  benefits  to  families  and  to  spin-offs  of\nemployment  created  by  graduate  entrepreneurship.  These  measures  will  be  incorporated  into\nthe overall EMIS to be developed under the Project.\n\nE.\n\nFinancial Sustainability\n\nThe  question  of  financial  sustainability  pertains  mainly  to  the  institutions  that  will  be\n136.\nshifted  from  central  or  provincial  management  to  local  ownership.  Some  will  become\nautonomous, self-managed institutions relying mainly on their own revenues. Others, depending\non the devolution plans adopted, will come under the control of LGUs. In all cases the training\ninstitutions  will  be  encouraged  to  generate  and  increase  their  own  earnings  from  a  variety  of\nactivities  including  increased  student  fees,  sale  of  products  from  shops  and  farms,  sale  of\nprograms  and  services  to  the  public,  sponsorship  from  industry,  and  similar  activities.  The\ninstitutions will be encouraged to take an active role in promoting these activities and allowed to\nretain incomes to support their training programs. As part of the devolution process, LGUs will\nbe involved in assisting the training institutions to cover recurrent costs on a declining basis to\nmaintain project facilities, activities, and programs after the Project is completed.\n\n\f33\n\n137. Other  parts of  the  project  will also  generate  some  revenues.  The  expanded  system  of\noccupational tests will be self-financing for the most part, as test takers pay  test fees.  TESDA\nwill  recover  part  of  the  project  cost  through  revenues  generated  by  the  sale  of  courseware,\ncurriculum guides and training packages to private institutions.\n\nF.\n\nRisks\n\nThree main risks exist for the Project. First, training institutions risk loss of quality as they\n138.\nmove from TESDA to local or self-administration. That is because TESDA has staff with higher\nqualifications and often allocates  more  resources  to  institutions  under  its direct administration.\nThe Project counters this risk by providing ample staff development for local governments and\nadministrators  of  training  institutions,  and  assistance  to  build  training  facilities.  Recent\ninnovations also provide a basis for monitoring quality, e.g.,  competency-based  training  with  a\ncheck on exit quality through testing. These will be improved and expanded under the Project.\nTESDA will check quality trends and advise on remedial actions should any significant decline in\nquality occur.\n\n139. Second, a project of this size and diversity inevitably faces implementation risks. It could\nbe too much for one organization to manage. This risk is minimized because the organizations\n(DBP  and  LBP)  that  will  handle  two  main  project  components\u2014FTESD  and  the  SF\u2014have\nextensive experience in handling similar programs. In addition, the main implementing agency,\nTESDA, has had experience in implementing externally financed projects. Its performance in the\nrecently  completed World Bank-financed  Second  Vocational  Training  Project  was  rated  highly\nsatisfactory.\n\n140.\nThird, risk is associated with the capacity and willingness of the LGUs, other government\nagencies,  NGOs,  and  the  local  communities  to  adopt,  finance,  and  effectively  manage  the\ndevolved project institutions. To counter this potential risk, TESDA has already initiated dialogue\nwith the agencies concerned and will develop a comprehensive devolution plan in consultation\nwith LGUs and other agencies. Initially, it is expected that selected schools among the  project\ninstitutions  would  serve  as  pilot  cases.  But,  based  on  experience  and  lessons  learned,  a\ndevolution scheme will be implemented more widely.\n\n141. Other risks exist, but they are considered minor. Private training institutions may not, in\nthe end, avail themselves of the loan funds available for quality improvements under the Project.\nHowever,  such an outcome  would  contradict  the  current evidence of  capital  constraints  in  the\nfeasibility  study  carried  out  in  1999.  If  loan  uptake  is  low,  ADB  and  DBP  will  investigate  the\nreasons and amend the terms accordingly. DBP will carefully assess the financial soundness of\nthe potential borrowers to assure full repayments of the loans and interest. Improper targeting of\nscholarships  could  also  occur,  but  this  has  not  been  a  problem  under  present  schemes.\nRecipients of educational loans may fail to repay their dues but mechanisms have been built in\nto  enhance  higher  rates  of  repayment.  Similarly,  a  risk  exists  that  the  Government\u2014facing\nbudget shortages\u2014will cut PESFA scholarships. An assurance included in the Project cements\nthe commitment to continue, at least at the present level.\n\n\f34\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  legal\n\n142.\ndocuments, the Government and DBP have agreed to the following specific assurances:\n\nTESDA  and  DBP  will  cooperate  closely  in  conducting  public  campaigns  to\npromote the FTESD among eligible private institutions.\nThroughout the implementation period, the Government will maintain the number\nand  value  of  PESFA  scholarships  administered  by  TESDA  at  a  level  not  less\nthan that financed in 1999.\nThe  Government  will  introduce  measures  to  ensure  that  public  training\ninstitutions  are  able  to  retain  and  use,  for  the  training  purposes,  the  revenues\nthey generate through tuition charges, sale of courses and sale of products and\nservices.\nDBP will maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10 percent and a minimum\nreturn on average total assets of at least 0.3 percent.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursements of Loan Proceeds to Public Institutions\n\n143.\n\nThe Government agreed that no withdrawals will be made for:\n\nany  provincial  training  center  or  Project  institution  until  the  Government,  ADB,\nand the LGU or NGO concerned agree on a detailed and time-bound devolution\nplan for that provincial training center or Project institution, which plan includes a\ndetailed  devolution  strategy  and  legal  framework,  a  detailed  implementation\nschedule (which, to the extent possible, will provide for devolution during Project\nimplementation),  a  financial  plan  and  forecast,  and  a  detailed  development\nstrategy;\nestablishing  and  equipping  skills  assessment  centers  throughout  the  country,\ntraining the personnel therefor, and improving the provincial training centers, until\nthe NDF Credit Agreement is effective or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nare  made,  for  the  financing  of  these  activities,  within  12  months  from  date  the\nLoan Agreement with ADB becomes effective;.\nestablishing  and  equipping  skills  assessment  centers  throughout  the  country,\ntraining the personnel therefor, upgrading the Project institutions, and improving\nthe  provincial  training  centers,  until  the  OPEC  Loan  Agreement  is  effective  or\nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  are  made,  for  the  financing  of  these\nactivities,  within  12  months  from  date  the  Loan  Agreement  with  ADB  becomes\neffective;\nupgrading the  Project  institutions,  and  improving  the  provincial  training  centers,\nuntil \nis  effective  or  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  are  made,  for  the  financing  of  these  activities,  within  12\nmonths from date the Loan Agreement with ADB becomes effective;\nStudent  Loan  Fund  until  the  detailed  implementation  procedures  therefor  have\nbeen  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  all  documents  and\nagreements deemed necessary therefor by ADB, in its sole discretion, shall have\nbeen duly  authorized, executed  and  delivered,  and  all  conditions  necessary  for\nthe proper implementation of the Student Loan Fund fulfilled.\n\nthe  DANIDA  Credit  Agreement \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n\f35\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n\n144.\nADB and recommend that the Board approve\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe loan of $25,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to the Republic of\nthe Philippines for the Technical Education and Skills Development Project, with\na  term  of 25  years,  including  a grace period  of  5  years, and  with  interest  to  be\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate  system\nfor  US dollar  loans and  such  other terms and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the\nBoard;\nthe  loan  of  Y2,166,700,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  the\nDevelopment  Bank  of  the  Philippines,  to  be  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines, for the Fund for Technical Education and Skills Development, with a\nterm  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  interest  to  be\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s market-based loan facility, and such other\nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the\ndraft Loan and Guarantee Agreements presented to the Board;

Many private technical education and skills development (TESD) institutions\nneed  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  programs.  To  assist  these  institutions,  which  enroll\napproximately  80  percent  of  TESD  students,  the  Project  will  establish  the  Fund  for  Technical\nEducation and Skills Development (FTESD) to provide loans to eligible institutions.\n\n2.\nScope  and  objectives.  From  FTESD the  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (DBP)\nwill provide subloans to eligible private TESD institutions that will use the loan funds to procure\nequipment and instructional materials, improve courses and programs, set up staff development\nprograms, and upgrade facilities but excluding the construction of new buildings.\n\nSource  of  fund.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of\n3.\nY2,166,700,000  through  its  market-based  loan  window  to  DBP  with  government  guarantee  to\nset up the FTESD.\n\nEligible borrowers. Private TESD institutions offering postsecondary, nondegree TESD\n4.\nprograms  in  priority  areas  such  as  information  technology,  engineering  technology,  food\ntechnology and services, and tourism among others are eligible to borrow from FTESD.\n\nCriteria for evaluation and award. Private TESD institutions wishing to apply for a loan\n5.\nwith DBP will first register their programs with TESDA for subsequent program assessment and\naccreditation. The registered institutions will then be eligible to borrow from the FTESD for any\nor  combination  of  the  following  purposes:  (i)  upgrading  facilities  such  as  workshops,\nlaboratories,  or  academic  buildings;  (ii)  purchasing  equipment,  instructional  materials,  and\nbooks in  the priority  areas;  (iii)  staff  development  programs;  (iv)  developing  and  implementing\nnew  programs;  (v)  improving  or  expanding  cooperation  programs  with  the  private  sector  to\nenhance  training  and  employment  prospects  of  graduates;  and  (vi)  other  related  quality\nimprovement programs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Each applicant will submit a\ncompleted  application  form  to  any  DBP  branch  or  headquarters.  The  information  will  include\n(i) educational data for the institution, (ii) financial  status of  the  institution,  (iii)  project  proposal\nincluding a description of the project and expected benefits, (iv) personal data of the owners or\nshareholders,  (v)  audited  financial  statements  of  the  institution,  (vi)  cash-flow  analysis  and\nrepayment schedules, and (vii) long-term (i.e., 10 years) institutional development plan including\nenrollment  projections.  DBP  will  evaluate  the  application  based  on,  but  not  limited  to,  the\nfollowing criteria: (i) relevance of the project objectives and scope to the priority skills areas and\naccreditation  standard;  (ii)  benefits  to  the  students,  communities  and  local  economy;\n(iii) educational  values  and  relevance \ninstitutional  development  plan;\nthe \n(iv) financial  feasibility  and  return  on  investment  of  the  project;  (v)  financial  capacity  of  the\nborrower; (vi) soundness and economy in the use of resources for the intended purposes; (vii)\nimplementation  plan,  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the  progress  of  the  Project;  and  (viii)\nmanagement\u2019s  ability  and  commitments  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  supported  programs  to\npass the accreditation standards.\n\nlong-term \n\nto \n\n6.\nImplementation  arrangements.  DBP  headquarters  will  manage  the  FTESD.  Eligible\nprivate TESD institutions can apply for a loan at any DBP lending outlet. DBP will evaluate the\napplication  based  on  the  criteria  described  in  para.  5.  In  particular,  DBP  will  give  special\nemphasis to educational values and benefits of the Project and the institution\u2019s creditworthiness\nand financial capacity to repay the loan. A loan must be fully secured by real estate mortgage\nand chattel mortgage or collateral substitutes, and joint and several signatures of the principals\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nof  the  borrowing  entity.  ADB  will  regularly  review  the  subloan  approval  process  to  ensure  its\ntransparency and effectiveness. Based on the number of applicants and requirements for loan\nfunds, DBP will submit quarterly to ADB withdrawal applications for release of the loan proceeds\nfor disbursements to the subborrowers.\n\nTerms and conditions. The ADB loan to DBP will finance up to 80 percent of the loan\n7.\nto  the  eligible  private  TESD  institutions,  with  the  borrower  contributing  20  percent  of  the  total\nproject cost in the form of equity participation. The loan will have a maximum period of 10 years,\nbut  not  longer  than  the  economic  life of  the assets  financed,  to  be  determined  jointly  by  DBP\nand the borrower on a case-by-case basis. DBP will allow a grace period of 6-24 months after\nthe  initial drawdown.  Thereafter, quarterly  payments  of  equal  amount  are  made  until  the  loan\nmatures.  A  commitment  fee  of  0.75  percent  per  annum  will  be  charged  on  the  undisbursed\nportion of the loan.\n\n8.\nInterest rate. The interest rate will be determined on the basis of full cost recovery. The\nindicative  interest  rate  as  approved  by  the  Department  of  Finance  ranges  from  11.5  to\n14.0 percent. In addition, a front-end fee of 1 percent will be charged on the loan amount.\n\n9.\nDisbursement procedures. DBP will set up a separate account for the FTESD at DBP\nheadquarters. DBP will submit withdrawal applications to ADB for release of the loan proceeds\nquarterly based on the needs of the subborrowers.\n\n10.\nMonitoring, supervision, and reporting requirements. DBP will visit the projects and\nthe  borrowing  TESD  institutions at  least  annually  to  monitor  the  use  of  the  loan  funds  and  to\nensure full compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan. As part of its requirements for\nthe registration and accreditation process, TESDA will also inspect the projects and assess the\ntechnical  benefits  to  and  impact  of  the  loans  on  the  students  and  staff  of  the  borrowing\ninstitutions. ADB, DBP, and TESDA may hold consultative meetings and field joint missions to\nreview  the  projects  at  the  borrowing  institutions.  The  borrowers  of  the  subloans  will  submit  a\nprogress  report  to  DBP  semiannually.  DBP  will  submit  semiannual  reports  to  ADB  on  the\nimplementation status of the FTESD.\n\n11.\nProcurement.  Goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  the  subloans  will  be  procured\nsubject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Guidelines for Procurement under Asian Development Bank\nloans  (para.  3.9  of  the  Guidelines).  The  borrowers  will  be  free  to  use  the  appropriate\nprocurement  procedures  subject  to  efficiency,  technical  acceptability,  and  reliability  of  the\nservices and goods and provided  that  goods  and  services  are  supplied from and  produced  in\nADB member countries.\n\n12.\nBeneficiaries. From a preliminary survey, it is envisaged that  about 120 private  TESD\ninstitutions will apply for loans with average amounts ranging from Y8,100,100 to Y27,000,000\nto a maximum of Y110,000,000. DBP will seek ADB\u2019s approval for a subloan amount between\nY55,000,000  -  Y110,000,000.  The  loan  funds  will  enable  the  borrowers  to  upgrade  their\nworkshops and  laboratories, purchase  equipment  and  instructional  materials,  and  train  faculty\nand staff, among others. These activities are expected to improve the quality of TESD programs\nin these schools.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nSCHOLARSHIP FUND\n\n1.\nRationale. A large number of poor Filipinos cannot afford to give their children education\nbeyond high school level. In addition, young people in rural areas have limited opportunities to\navail  themselves  of  skills  training  or  to  further  their  education  because  of  the  unavailability  of\ntraining facilities and schools in their vicinities. The Scholarship Fund (SF) established under the\nProject  will  assist  those  requiring  financial  assistance\u2014especially  in  rural  areas\u2014to  undergo\nboth formal and nonformal technical education and skills development (TESD) training in private\nand  public  institutions.  The  target  beneficiaries  are  students  living  in  the  poorest  regions  and\nprovinces, but consideration will also be given to qualified students in other parts of the country.\n\nObjective. The SF will provide scholarship assistance  to eligible  trainees from families\n2.\nwhose  income  is  below  the  official  poverty  line.  A  student/trainee  meeting  this  income\nqualification  must  also  maintain  passing  marks  in  his/her  studies  to  continue  to  be  eligible  to\nreceive assistance.\n\n3.\nAllocation  process.  The  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority\n(TESDA) will allocate available funds for scholarships to provinces based on its current formula\nfor  Private  Education  Student  Fund  Assistance  (PESFA)  scholarships.  Provinces  with  lower\naverage income will be given preference. Provincial offices of TESDA, in turn, will publicize the\navailability of the scholarship funds.\n\n4.\nEligibility and selection process. The SF is intended to function much like a voucher.\nStudents  and  trainees  whose  family  income  is  below  the  official  poverty  line  can  apply  for  a\nscholarship  to  study  in  formal  or  nonformal  TESD  programs  in  both  public  and  private\ninstitutions  that  are  registered  with  or  accredited  by  TESDA.  Students  already  enrolled  who\nmeet income eligibility and are in good academic standing with at least a passing grade for all\nsubjects  can  apply  for  assistance  at  the  schools  where  they  are  enrolled.  For  enrollees  of\nnonformal  TESD  programs,  the  enrollees  will  be  given  the  scholarship  only  once  to  complete\nthe  training  program.  For  formal  TESD  programs,  which  require  full-time  studies  leading  to  a\ncertificate or diploma below degree level, assistance may be extended after the first  year until\nthe student completes the program, provided that the progress is satisfactory and completion is\nin  a  maximum  of  three  years  or  within  the  standard  duration  of  the  programs.  The  school  or\ntraining center will be required to report the individual student academic performance to TESDA\nthrough its provincial and regional offices on a semestral basis.\n\n5.\nGender participation. To provide more opportunities and encourage women to enroll in\nTESD programs, 50 percent of the scholarships for formal and nonformal TESD training will be\nawarded to women.\n\n6.\nSelection  process.  Qualified  applicants  whose  family  earning  is  below  the  official\npoverty line can apply for  a  scholarship at a  school  or  training  center as  either  an  entering  or\ncontinuing student and trainee. They must submit an application form together with official proof\nof  income  of  their  family  or  themselves.  For  nonformal  training,  the  age  limit  for  qualified\napplicants  is  40  years  old.  All  applicants  will  be  given  standard  vocational  aptitude  tests  to\ndetermine their readiness and the suitability of the  program  they  want  to  enroll  in.  If  there are\nmore  applicants  than  the  available  scholarships  for  the  school,  province,  or  region  the\nscholarships  will  be  awarded  to  those  with  top  scores  until  the  scholarship  funds  for  the\nschools/centers or provinces  are  exhausted.  The  schools,  centers, and  TESDA  provincial and\nregional offices will ensure that the selection process is fair, transparent, and based on the\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nfinancial  needs  and  academic  ability  of  the  students/trainees  in  accordance  with  the  criteria\ndescribed in this section.\n\nAmount  of  scholarship.  The  maximum  amount  for  each  scholarship  is  P14,500  per\n7.\nstudent per academic year or, in the case of nonformal training, for the duration of the training\nperiod according to the prescribed or approved curriculum and program.\n\n8.\nThe breakdown of the scholarship fund in order of priority for the different expenses is as\nfollows:  (i)  actual  costs  of  tuition  and  other  related  school  fees,  (ii)  costs  of  textbooks  and\nrequired  instructional  materials  as  prescribed  by  the  school/center  for  the  course  or  training\nprogram, and (iii) living expenses.\n\n9.\nAfter the costs of the first two items have been calculated, the remaining amount of the\nP14,500  allocation  will  be  for  living  expenses.  As  a  general  guideline,  the  living  expense\nallowance  should  not  exceed  P600  per  month  to  cover  transportation  and  meals  at  the\nschool/center. Living expenses will be provided to the recipients only during the time the schools\nor centers are in session, excluding the term break or long vacation.\n\n10.\nAfter  the  students  have  been  selected  for  the  scholarship,  the  school  will  decide  in\nconsultation with the students and their parents/guardians the priority needs of the students and\nthe allowances needed to cover their actual living expenses. The school will then submit a list of\neligible students,  together  with  the  recommended  scholarship amount for each  student, to  the\nprovincial and regional offices of TESDA, which will endorse the applicants to TESDA for final\napproval.\n\nAdministration of the scholarship fund. The scholarship fund will be deposited in an\n11.\nimprest account for  the Project  at  the  central  bank  of  the  Philippines\u2014the  Bangko  Sentral  ng\nPilipinas  (BSP).  TESDA  has  designated  the  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (LBP),  which  has\nextensive experience in managing government student assistance and loan programs, to be the\ndepository  bank  for  the  SF  and  to  be  responsible  for  disbursing  assistance  directly  to  the\nrecipients  for  living  allowances  and  other  related  expenses  and  to  the  schools  for  tuition  and\nother  school  fees.  LBP  has  a  comprehensive  network  of  branches  in  small  towns  and\ncommunities  throughout  the  country.  To  operationalize  the  SF,  TESDA  will  open  an  account\nwith LBP. TESDA periodically will transfer the SF proceeds from the imprest account at BSP to\nthe LBP scholarship account upon submission of reports, necessary documents, and withdrawal\napplication  by  LBP.  The  Scholarship  Fund  account,  which  is  an  interest-bearing  account  with\nLBP, will maintain an average weekly balance of a total peso equivalent of $1 million.\n\n12.\nDisbursements of scholarship funds to the  recipients. The scholarship amounts will\nbe disbursed to the recipients on a monthly basis, and the tuition and other related fees will be\npaid  directly  to  the  schools  on  a  term  basis.  LBP  has  developed  a  software  package  called\nPACSVAL,  which  will  be  given  to  TESDA  to  maintain  a  database  on  the  recipients  of  the\nscholarships and to provide data and information to LBP three days before the payment date to\nthe  recipients  and  the  schools  where  the  recipients  will  be  enrolled  for  disbursements  of\nscholarship funds to the recipients. LBP will transfer the scholarship funds representing the fees\nand allowances of the recipients to the respective LBP branches for credit to the accounts of the\nrecipients using the online facilities of LBP. All fund transfers of tuition fees to the schools will be\nmade directly to the schools in accordance with the instruction of TESDA.\n\n13.\nOperation of the recipient subaccounts. The recipients of the  scholarships  will  open\nand maintain either regular savings account with passbook or savings account with ATM access\nat the designated LBP online branches. The funds will be transferred to the designated account\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\non  a  monthly  basis.  The  scholarship  recipients  will  be  required  to  sign  a  receipt  form  that  is\nmaintained at the institutions in which they are enrolled. The schools will submit the records to\nTESDA through the provincial and regional offices for verification and validation purposes.\n\nReporting  requirements.  The  monthly  consolidated  bank  statements  of \n\nthe\n14.\ndisbursement  status,  together  with  the  supporting  documents,  will  be  forwarded  by  LBP  to\nTESDA 10 working days after the end of the month. In addition, a separate semiannual report\non  the  amount  received,  released,  and  outstanding  balance  of  all  accounts  will  also  be\nsubmitted to TESDA.\n\n15.\nBeneficiaries.  Approximately  20,000  students/trainees  will  benefit  from  the  SF.\nTESDA\u2019s  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  make  periodic  checks  to  ensure  that  the\nrecipients  actually  meet  the  income  criterion  set  as  the  basis  for  access  to  funds.  This  is\nimportant to ensure that appropriate targeting is actually achieved and the beneficiaries are the\nmost deserving.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 7, page 1\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\nTable A7.1: Project Cost Estimates by Item of Expenditure - TESDA Loan\n(in $ million)\n\nA.

As the\noversight  agency  for  the  TESD  subsector,  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development\nAuthority  (TESDA)  needs  to  strengthen  its  capacity,  role,  and  functions  to  carry  out  its  mandate\nmore effectively with the ultimate objective of divesting its current function as provider of TESD to\nlocal government units (LGUs) and other agencies. Within this context the technical assistance (TA)\nwill  assist  the  Government  in  establishing  quality  control  systems  in  TESD,  strengthening  the\nmanagement  and  supervisory  capacity  of  TESDA  and  its  network,  and  enhancing  employment\nopportunities  and  prospects  for  TESD  graduates.  Ultimately,  the  TA  will  contribute  to  the\nimprovement  of  the  quality  of  TESD  programs  that,  in  turn,  will  produce  better-qualified  skilled\nworkers, thus enhancing the competitiveness of the country.\n\n2.\n\nThe TA consists of three major components.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  quality  of  TESD  programs \n\nStrengthening the management capacity of TESDA as the oversight agency for the\nTESD  subsector,  its  network  of  regional  and  provincial  institutions,  and  LGUs  to\nprovide  effective  leadership  and  support  to  public  and  private  providers  of  TESD\nprograms.\nthe  development  and\nImproving \nimplementation  of  an  accreditation  system,  skills \ntesting  and  certification,\nequivalency  system,  quality  assurance  programs,  dual  training  system,  and\napprenticeship system.\nEnhancing \ninstitutionalization  of \nplacement/support \ndevelopment programs, etc., in TESD institutions.\n\nthe\ncounseling \njob\nlinkages,  entrepreneurship\n\ncareer  guidance  and \nindustry-institution \n\nthe  employment  opportunities  of  TESD  graduates \n\nthrough \nservices, \n\nservices, \n\nthrough \n\nB. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n3.\nThe total cost of the TA (Table A10.1) is estimated at $1,115,000 equivalent, including\n$495,000  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $620,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a grant of $495,000 to fund all foreign exchange\ncosts  and  $280,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Government  will  contribute  the\nequivalent of $340,000 largely in kind. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian\nCurrency Crisis Support Facility provided by the Government of Japan.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n4.\nTESDA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for  providing\nadministrative and counterpart support to the consultants. TESDA will provide counterpart staff to\nwork  closely  with  the  TA  consultants  for  each  component.  The  TA  advisory  committee  will  be\nappointed by TESDA and chaired by the project director. The main function of the committee is to\nguide the work of the consultants and assess the outputs/deliverables produced by the consultants\nto ensure high quality and standard of the products and direct contributions to the improvement of\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nquality, relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of the TESD system. The outputs of the TA will be\npresented to the TESDA governing body for endorsement and implementation within the broader\nframework of the Project.\n\nThe TA will be implemented in three phases over 18 months. In the first phase, international\n5.\nand domestic consultants will review, design, and prepare a list of expected outputs for ADB\u2019s and\nTESDA\u2019s approval. In the second phase, TESDA will implement the outputs for 6 months, evaluate\nthe  outcomes,  and  identify  any  weaknesses  of  the  system  for  further  improvements.  During  the\nfor  better\nthird  phase, \nresults/performance. The TA will require the services of six international consultants for 16 person-\nmonths, and eight domestic consultants for a total of 34 person-months.

The  Bank\u2019s  net  income  after  loan  loss  provision  and  tax  amounted  to\nP515.14 million.  In  1998,  DBP  declared  cash  dividends  in  the  amount  of  P615.94  million  for\n1997 and advanced partial payment of P188 million for 1998. In addition, the Bank declared\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nstock  dividends  of  P7.5  billion.  To  affirm  the  viability  of  DBP  as  a  government  financial\ninstitution,  DBP  has  constantly  remitted  cash  dividends  to  the  National  Treasury  totaling\nP5.85 billion for the past 12 years. (See Appendix 3 for financial statements and Audit Report.)\n\nCredit Rating\n\nDBP has retained for the third consecutive rating period its BBB pi (public information or\n\n5.\n\u201cpi\u201d) rating from Standard and Poor\u2019s, making it the highest rated Philippine bank.\n\nExperience in working with Donors\n\nDBP  has  worked  with  other  donors  over  the  years.  In  1998  it  concluded  agreements\n6.\ntotaling P13 billion in new funds of which a large chunk is for financing requisites of small and\nmedium  enterprises  (SMEs).  These  were  the  P6.91  billion  from  Japan  Overseas  Economic\nCooperation  Fund  for  the  shipping  industry  and  its  subsectors  and  P5.81  billion  from  World\nBank for SMEs in manufacturing. A total of P12.44  billion fresh funds from at  least  six foreign\ncreditors were made available in 1998 to finance the Bank\u2019s various lending operations. Of this,\nP5.63 billion was secured to refinance DBP\u2019s 1993 Eurobonds that matured in July 1998.\n\nIn September 1998, DBP signed the loan agreement for the second phase of Domestic\n7.\nShipping  Modernization  Programs  (DSMP)  with  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  of\nJapan. DSMP II is a Y20 billion loan that will expand the present coverage to include: shipyards,\nmaritime education, port development, and cargo handling facilities especially in rural areas.\n\n8.\nIn December 1999 DBP signed two credit agreements with Japan Bank for International\nCooperation for (i) Environmental Infrastructure Support Credit Program II for Y20.5  billion, and\n(ii) Industrial Support Services Expansion Program II for Y35 billion yen as part of the 23rd yen\nloan package.\n\nAlso in December 1999 DBP signed an agreement with Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau\n\n9.\n(KfW) Germany for support of a credit line for small and medium enterprises for DM50 million.\n\nBranches\n\nAccounting Standard\n\n10.\n\nDBP has a network of 73 branches throughout the country. (Appendix 2)\n\n11.\nDBP  has  been  awarded  the  Most  Outstanding  Accounting  Office  Award  twice  in  1995\nand 1998 from the Association of Government Accountants of the Philippines (AGAP) for having\nexemplary met the criteria of timeliness, accuracy, and reliability set by the AGAP Committee on\nAwards.  In  receiving  the  award  in  1995,  DBP  was  one  of  only  three  awardees  under  the\ncorporate category.\n\nADB Experience with DBP\n\n12.\nADB has provided 3 loans to DBP: (i) Development Bank of the Philippines (Loan 247-\nPHI for $25 million approved on 9 December 1975 and closed on 18 August 1982), (ii) Second\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (Loan 321-PHI for $35 million approved on 29 November\n1977  and  closed  on  20  February  1984),  and  (iii)  Third  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines\n(Loan 1088-PHI for $100 approved on 16 July 1991 and closed on 27 March 1996).\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nThe objectives  of  the  Third  Development  Bank of the  Philippines  Project  were  twofold:\n13.\n(i) support  private  sector  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  across  a  broad  spectrum  of\nindustries  by  augmenting  the  flow  of  long-term  industrial  credit,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the\ndevelopment  finance  activities  of  participating  financial  institutions  (PFI)  and  upgrade  their\ninstitutional  capabilities.  The  Project  aimed  to  promote  SMEs  and  promote  development  in\nurban and rural areas. By blending their funds with those available under the Project, the PFIs\nwere expected to increase at prudent levels the maturity period of their loans.\n\n14.\nAll  three  loans  were  rated  partly  successful.  The  project  design  of  the  third  loan  was\njudged not conducive to financing SMEs. It was suggested that in the future, the extent and the\nnature of the  demand for  credit  should  be  assessed  separately  for  SMEs,  and  the  terms  and\nconditions  of  the  loan  and  its  ability  to  fulfill  the  needs  of  SMEs  must  be  carefully  reviewed.\nSeparating  SME  lending  programs  from  those  that  also  cater  to  large-scale  clients  for  SME\nlending may be more effective.\n\nFor the Technical Education and Skills Development Project two separate surveys were\n15.\ncarried  out  to  determine  the  need  for  capital  of  private  technical  education  and  skills\ndevelopment (TESD)  schools and  their  willingness  to  borrow  including  the amounts,  interests,\nterms and  conditions and financial  capacity  to  repay  the  loans.  DBP  and  Technical  Education\nand Skills Development Authority (TESDA) were involved closely in the design and conduct of\nthe second survey carried out nationwide in 1999. The results of the survey indicated that there\nis  sufficient  demand  for  the  loan  amount  of  $20  million  to  be  provided  by  ADB  to  DBP  for\nonlending to private TESD schools.\n\n16.\nTo promote the Fund for Technical Education and Skills Development TESDA and DBP\nwill  cooperate  closely  in  launching  public  campaigns  among  private  TESD  schools.  DBP\nbranches will also actively advertise the financing facility and  assist  the  TESD  schools  in  their\nareas in the application and selection process.\n\n17. With regard to DBP\u2019s performance as executing agency, the Project Performance Audit\nReport  for  the  Project  concludes  that  both  DBP  and  the  PFIs  have  exhibited  strong  financial\nperformance and have adhered to prudential financial management practices.1\n\n                                               \n1   Asian Development Bank.
