The \nproject  falls into  environmental  category  B.  The  additional works  to  be \nimplemented  under  the  modified  project  do  not  introduce  new  or \nsignificantly  different  environmental  impacts,  since  they  are  largely \ncontained within or close to the areas already assessed in the original \nproject\u2019s  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE).  The  site  for  Samrong \nStation consists of paddy fields and grassland with sparsely populated \nareas  nearby.  Other  components  involve  rehabilitation  of  existing \nsidings and construction of short new sidings (about 500\u2013800 meters in \nlength) linking to two dry ports about 50 meters from the existing main \nline.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  has \ncompleted an IEE of the additional works. \n \nThe  original  project  was  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks  relating \nto  involuntary  resettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  for  the  original \nproject  is  being  updated,  following  the  completion  of  detailed  design. \nThe  modified  project  will  result  in  additional  resettlement  impacts  at \nSamrong  because  of  the  construction  of  a  new  freight  facility.  An \nadditional  232  households  in  this  area  will  be  affected.  The  draft \nresettlement plan for Samrong has been finalized and approved by the \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nThe  principles  for  addressing  social  and  gender  issues  are  set  out  in \nthe  original  project.  The  additional  works  under \nthe  proposed \nsupplementary  financing  do  not  lead  to  new  or  different  issues.  The \nmitigation  measures  adopted  for  the  original  project  will  also  be \nimplemented for the supplementary financing. \n \n\n \nOriginal Project \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nSocial Safeguards \nAssessment \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nSupplementary \nFinancing \nDescription \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \nRationale \n\ntransport \n\nrequirements; \n\nfuture  multimodal \n\nThe  original  project  is  rehabilitating  and  restructuring  the  railway  in \nCambodia. In addition to this, the supplementary financing will be used \nto  (i) establish  a  new  freight  and  rolling  stock  maintenance  facility  at \nSamrong,  10  kilometers  west  of  Phnom  Penh,  with  sufficient  space  to \n(ii) upgrade  or \nmeet \nstrengthen parts of the main line to enable early initiation of integrated \nmultimodal services; and (iii) establish additional sidings to terminals to \nfacilitate multimodal connectivity. The combination of the original project \nand  the  supplementary  financing  will  be  referred  to  as  the  modified \nproject. The key activities for implementing the new facility at Samrong \ninclude  design  of  the  facility;  procurement  of  contracts;  preparation, \napproval, and implementation of the resettlement plan for the area; and \nimplementation  of  works.  Strengthening  and  upgrading  of  track  does \nnot require additional design or resettlement, activities consist primarily \nof  the  installation  of  heavier  rails  and  new  sleepers.  Installation  of \nadditional  sidings  to  terminals  requires  additional  design  and  minor \nresettlement.  The  outcome  would  be  a  selectively  upgraded  railway  in \nCambodia exceeding the rehabilitation envisaged in the original project, \nenabling  early  takeoff  of  an  integrated,  railway-based,  multimodal \ntransport system. \n \nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Outcome  Monitoring  and  Procurement \nReview will be provided to assist MPWT in developing long-term output \nmonitoring  as  required  by  ADB  and  the  governments  of  Australia  and \nCambodia.  Outcome  monitoring  will  take  an  integrated  approach  and \nbuild  on  the  project-level  monitoring  taking  place  through  the  work  of \nMPWT,  the  contractor,  and  the  project  consultant.  The  TA  will  also \nsupport the procurement of additional works for track upgrading, which \ntrack \nimplemented \nwill  be \nrehabilitation contracts. \n \nThe private sector concessionaire selected for the railway in Cambodia \nis  a  large  international  logistics  firm  that  operates  worldwide.  The \nconcessionaire  has  proposed  a  business  plan  that  would  not  only \ndevelop  railway  traffic,  but  also  integrate  the  railway  into  a  seamless \nregional  multimodal  transport  system  with  the  railway  providing  the \nmedium-  and  long-distance  backbone  for  links  between  dedicated \nterminals  in  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  and  to  destinations  in  southern \nViet  Nam.  This  plan  would  elevate  Cambodia  from  a  subregionally \nconnected local transport market into a subregional hub in the southern \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS).  Achieving  hub  status  could  create \nsignificant additional long-term development opportunities in Cambodia \nin  areas  such  as  logistic  services  (warehousing,  packaging,  and \nforwarding)  and  manufacturing \n(assembly  and  production  of \ncomponents). It would also generate substantial subregional benefits by \nenabling the streamlining and rationalization of supply lines, which are \nessential to achieving and maintaining international competitiveness. \n \nEstablishing integrated logistics services based on the railway would be \nan  early  realization  of  the  commitment  that  GMS  leaders  made  at  the \n2008  summit  in  Vientiane  to  expand  the  GMS  economic  corridor \n\nthrough  variations  of \n\nthe  existing \n\n\fnetwork  through  multimodal  links.  It  would  also  enhance  the  original \nobjectives  of  the  rehabilitation  project  by  upgrading  railway  transport \nfrom a supplier of transport services to a supplier of complete logistics \nsolutions. This would improve transport efficiency and the integration of \nthis \nCambodia \ntransformation would strengthen trade and integration, and enhance the \nGMS  countries'  collective  competitiveness  and  economic  development \npotential. \n \n\nthe  southern  GMS. \n\nthe  medium \n\nterm, \n\ninto \n\nIn \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  modified  project  will  be  increased  domestic  and \nregional  trade  movement  on  the  railway  system,  thereby  supporting \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  be \nachieved  by  developing  the  railway  in  Cambodia  into  a  provider  of \nlogistics  services  in  Cambodia  and  neighboring  GMS  countries.  The \noutcome of the modified project will be a railway that is sustainable and \nefficiently operated. \n \nThe modified project is estimated to cost $141.6 million, including taxes \nand  duties  of  $14.9  million.  Of  the  total,  $73.0  million  is  estimated  for \nthe  original  rehabilitation  project  and  $68.6  million  for  the  additional \ncomponents under the supplementary financing. \n \n\n \nRevised Project \nInvestment Plan  \n\n \n\n \n\nRevised Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAdditional \nComponents \nunder Supple-\nmentary \nFinancing \n\nOriginal \nProject \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The  main  sources  of  project \nbenefits are (i) savings from the diversion of heavy freight and container \ntraffic  from  road  transport  to  more  economical  rail  transport;  and  (ii) \nmore traffic as a result of interconnecting Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet \nNam.  The  savings  will  reduce  the  costs  of  imported  inputs  such  as \ncement and fuel, which will promote the creation of new jobs and other \nincome-generating  opportunities  in  export  industries  in  Cambodia.  In \nthe  medium  term,  economic  integration  among  the  GMS  countries  will \nbe  enhanced,  which  will  increase  their  competitiveness  as  a  result  of \nfor  supply  chain \nlower \nmanagement.

The  MPWT  has  performed \nsatisfactorily  in  implementing  internationally  financed  projects.  The \nmodified  project  has  been  formulated  to  reduce  potential  economic, \nfinancial,  and  social  risks.  The  financial  and  economic  risks  are \nassociated  with  the  operation  of  the  railway,  which  will  depend  on  the \nfuture  level  of  traffic,  the  costs  of  construction,  and  the  efficiency  of \nfuture  railway  operations.  The  economic  risks  are  minimized  by  the \ninvolvement  of  a  private  railway  operator  that  will  realize  the  modified \nproject\u2019s benefits by providing railway services on a commercial basis. \nThe  social  risks  include  resettlement,  the  possible  spread  of  HIV \ninfection during construction, and the retrenchment of redundant railway \nstaff  in  connection  with  restructuring.

The  report  also  describes  proposed  administration  of \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  Australia  (footnote  1)  for \nOutcome  Monitoring  and  Procurement  Review,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  and  administration  of  the  grant,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to \nme by the Board, will approve the administration of TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nCambodia\u2019s  transport  sector  comprises  road,  railway,  and  inland  water  transport; \ninternational sea traffic through the seaport in Sihanoukville and the river port in Phnom Penh; \nand domestic and international air traffic centered on Cambodia\u2019s three international airports in \nPhnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville. Much of the country\u2019s transport infrastructure was \ndestroyed or substantially degraded during the war. Reestablishing the transport infrastructure \nand  modernizing  the  provision  of  transport  have  been  major  goals  of  the  government  for  the \npast  15  years.  Its  efforts  have  focused  on  (i) reconstructing  the  road  network;  (ii) modernizing \nand upgrading the international ports and airports; and (iii) privatizing and gradually modernizing \nthe  provision  of  transport.  As  a  result,  rehabilitation  of  the  core  road  network  is  substantially \ncomplete, and road rehabilitation efforts are being refocused on the secondary and tertiary road \nnetworks.  The  international  ports  and  airports  have  been  rehabilitated  and  substantially \nmodernized, and domestic and international inland water transport is developing. The railway is \nbeing  rehabilitated  and  its  operations  privatized  under  a  long-term  concession,  which  means \nthat  all  modes  of  transport  services  will  soon  be  provided  entirely  by  the  private  sector.2 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the governments of  France \nand  Japan  have  provided  a  major  portion  of  the  external  assistance  to  Cambodia's  transport \nsector.  ADB's  assistance  began  in  1993  with  the  Special  Rehabilitation  Assistance  Project,3 \nwhich included rehabilitation of national highways, sections of the railway network, and the port \nof Sihanoukville. In 2000, ADB provided a loan for the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project,4 \nwhich rehabilitated sections of the national highway that were damaged by the flood, along with \ncritical  sections  of  railway  track  and  embankments,  and  most  recently  provided  assistance  for \nperiodic  maintenance  of  the  highway  network.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  loans  to \nrehabilitate roads and widen bridges and culverts, procure railway wagons, and maintain roads. \nThe  Government  of  France  has  provided  financing  for  new  bridges,  development  of  the \ninternational  airports,  and  procurement  of  spare  parts  for  locomotives.  The  Government  of \nJapan  has  provided  assistance  for  the  construction  of  large  bridges,  upgrading  of  the  ports  in \nPhnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and rehabilitation of highways. Other recent bilateral assistance \n\n                                                 \n1   Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \n\nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank. \n\n2   Before the concession, the railway was operated by Royal Railways of Cambodia (RRC), which is a state-owned \n\nenterprise under the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT).

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fto the transport sector has come from (i) the Government of Australia for highway bridges and \nperiodic  highway  maintenance;  (ii)  the  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for \nrehabilitation of parts of National Road 7 and preparation of a feasibility study for the proposed \nconstruction of a new railway line to Ho Chi  Minh City, Viet Nam; and (iii) the governments of \nThailand and Viet Nam  for rehabilitation of roads. Appendix 2 lists assistance by development \npartners and ADB. \n \n4. \nTransport is more expensive in Cambodia than in its neighboring countries because of \n(i) significantly  higher  fuel  taxes,  which  are  a  major  source  of  government  revenues; \n(ii) transport  infrastructure  that  has  not  been  rehabilitated  yet,  especially  the  secondary  and \ntertiary  roads  and  the  railway,  which  increases  operating  costs  and  constrains  access; \n(iii) remaining  inefficiencies  in  transport  provision,  especially  in  road  transport,  which  is \ncharacterized  by  many  small  operators  without  the  scale,  management  capabilities,  and \nresources required to develop modern transport concepts such as seamless multimodal traffic \nand  full-service  door-to-door  transport;  and  (iv) remaining  barriers  to  the  free  flow  of  traffic \nacross Cambodia's international borders. As a result, staple commodities that the poor rely on \nare  more  expensive  in  Cambodia  than  in  neighboring  countries,  and  the  international \ncompetitiveness  of  Cambodia\u2019s  export  industries\u2014primarily  garments  and  tourism,  which  are \nthe main generators of new jobs and foreign currency\u2014is being eroded. These transport-related \nchallenges  are  major  constraints  on  economic  growth,  diminish  the  scope  for  the  economy  to \ndiversify  into  new  sectors  such  as  agricultural  processing  and  industrial  assembly,  and  hinder \nCambodia's effective integration into the subregional economy. \n \n5. \nAt  subregional  level,  cross-border  railway  transport  has  been  garnering  increasing \nattention  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  since  2006,  especially  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Several  new  projects  have  been  proposed  to \ninterconnect  these  countries,  and  to  connect  the  subregion  to  the  rest  of  Southeast  Asia  and \npart of the People\u2019s Republic of China that is outside the GMS. This renewed focus on railways \nreflects three primary concerns of the governments of GMS countries:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRapid export-driven economic growth has increased road traffic, outstripping the \nresources available for maintaining and adding capacity to the road network. This \nhas led to congestion and rising transport costs that potentially threaten the GMS \ncountries' international competitiveness and capacity for growth.  \nRising  energy  prices  and  growing  concerns  over  global  warming  has  placed \ngreater emphasis on energy efficiency, partly to retain competitiveness and partly \nto forestall possible future product emission standards in consumer countries that \ncould limit the allowable carbon footprint of imported goods. \nEscalating road casualties, resettlement, and the permanent loss of land to road \ninfrastructure  make  the  comparatively  safer  and  space-frugal  railways  more \nattractive. \n\n \n6. \nAs  a  result  of  these  concerns,  a  new  strategic  vision  has  emerged  among  the \ngovernments of GMS countries, focusing on multimodal transport systems with the railway as a \nbackbone  for  long-distance  and  cross-border  traffic.  To  act  as  backbone,  the  GMS  railways \nwould have to be efficient and interconnected across borders, have adequate capacity, and be \nconnected to suitable intermodal terminals. Further, to be a multimodal traffic system attractive \nto private users, the GMS railways will need to be commercially oriented and capable of offering \nintegrated logistics services. The sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nThe  issues  and  opportunities  facing  the  railway  were  first  analyzed  in  an  advisory  TA \nproject, 5  which  concluded  that  access  to  efficient  railway  transport  would  be  economically \nbeneficial for Cambodia, and (ii) the railway could become commercially viable if rehabilitated. \nTwo  small-scale  TA  studies  were  subsequently  conducted\u2014one  to  assess  the  likely  future \ndemand  for  railway  traffic  (the  transport  study),6 and  the  other  to  examine  the  possibilities  for \nestablishing  commercially  viable  railway  operations  (the  business  opportunity  study).7 These \nstudies  confirmed  sufficient  future  demand  to  make  rehabilitation  of  the  railway  economically, \nfinancially,  and  commercially  viable  for  the  private  sector  once  its  infrastructure  had  been \nrehabilitated. In response, the government requested a loan from ADB for the rehabilitation of \nthe  railway. 8  It  also  asked  for  advisory  TA  to  restructure  the  railway 9  by  assisting  the \ngovernment  with  privatizing  railway  operations  under  a  long-term  concession  agreement,  and \nstrengthening the government's regulatory capacity to manage and monitor the rail sector and \nthe concession in the future. \n \nThe Cambodian railway consists of two lines: (i) the northern line, which was built in the \n8. \n1930s and connects Phnom Penh to Poipet on the border with Thailand, where it links with the \nrailway  in  Thailand;  and  (ii) the  southern  line,  which  was  built  in  the  late  1960s  and  connects \nPhnom  Penh  with  Cambodia\u2019s  main  seaport  in  Sihanoukville.  The  northern  line  is  386 \nkilometers (km) long, but the last 48 km to the border with Thailand were destroyed during the \nwar. The southern line is about 254 km from where it branches off the northern line about 9 km \nfrom  the  station  in  Phnom  Penh,  making  the  total  distance  between  Phnom  Penh  and \nSihanoukville 263 km. The railway is meter gauge,10 as are the railway networks in neighboring \ncountries. The original project is restoring the railway\u2019s infrastructure by rehabilitating its existing \ntrack and reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with Thailand. \n \n9. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  financing  will  add  components  that  will  accelerate  the \ntakeoff  of  a  rail-based,  integrated  multimodal  system  providing  medium-  to  long-distance \ndomestic  and  regional  links  between  terminals  that  connect  to  road,  sea,  and  river  transport. \nThe railway is geographically suited for this because it (i) runs parallel to the country\u2019s busiest \nhighways  (National  Roads  3,  4,  and  5),  providing  feeder  access  to  and  from  railway  terminals \nalong  the  railway  lines;  (ii) interconnects  with  the  country's  two  main  international  connection \npoints  at  Sihanoukville  port  and  the  land  border  with  Thailand  at  Poipet,  from  where  it  links \ndirectly to the main industrial and logistics centers around Bangkok, thus providing subregional \nand international connectivity; and (iii) connects to the river port in Phnom Penh and to National \nRoad 1,  which  enables  integration  of  rail  transport  with  the  developing  inland  water  transport \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

Meter gauge refers to \nrails spaced 1.0 meter apart. Other common gauges are standard gauge (about 1.4 meters spacing), which is used \nin  the  PRC,  North  and  South  America,  and  most  of  Europe  and  Australia;  and  broad  gauge  (about  1.5  meters) \nwhich  is  used  in  the  Russian  Federation,  Central  Asia,  South  Asia  and  parts  of  Europe.  Trains  constructed  to \noperate on one gauge cannot operate on another gauge without modification. Meter gauge is the common railway \nstandard in Southeast Asia, which means that trains from various national railways can interoperate. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nsector to service traffic to and from northeastern Cambodia and Viet Nam\u2019s Mekong Delta. This \nnetwork  will  facilitate  bilateral  trade  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  and  between  Cambodia \nand Viet Nam, and could form the basis for establishing an attractive shortcut for the shipment \nof  time-sensitive  goods  between  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  once  suitable  integrated  transport \nservices are developed. \n \n10. \nThe  selected  concessionaire  is  a  large  international  logistics  firm  that  operates \nworldwide.  The  concessionaire's  business  plan  aims  to  develop  railway  traffic,  as  well  as \nsupport the integration of the railway into a seamless subregional, multimodal transport system. \nThe  concessionaire  foresees  the  railway  providing  medium-  and  long-distance  links  between \nterminals in Cambodia and Thailand, and possibly to destinations in southern Viet Nam in the \nfuture.  This  would  transform  the  railway  in  Cambodia  from  a  national  railway  connected  to \nThailand  into  a  subregional,  multimodal  transport  system  that  seamlessly  integrates  the \ncountries in the southern GMS. As a result, Cambodia would be elevated from a subregionally \nconnected  local  transport  market  to  a  subregional  hub  in  the  southern  GMS.  Achieving  hub \nstatus could create significant additional long-term development prospects in Cambodia in areas \nsuch  as  logistic  services  (warehousing,  packaging,  and  forwarding)  and  manufacturing \n(assembly  and  production  of  components).  It  would  also  generate  substantial  subregional \nbenefits  by  enabling  streamlining  and  rationalization  of  supply  lines,  which  are  essential  to \nachieving  and  maintaining  international  competitiveness.  The  potential  is  illustrated  by  the \nimpact both locally and regionally of long-established transport hubs, such as Hong Kong, China \nand Singapore. \n \n11. \nEstablishing  integrated  logistics  services  based  on  the  railway  would  be  an  early \nrealization  of  the  commitment  that  GMS  leaders  made  at  the  2008  summit  in  Vientiane  to \nexpand  the  economic  corridor  network  through  multimodal  links  in  the  GMS.  It  would  also \nenhance the objectives of the rehabilitation project by upgrading the railway from a supplier of \ntransport  services  to  a  supplier  of  complete  logistics  solutions,  which  would  improve  transport \nefficiency  and  the  integration  of  Cambodia  into  the  southern  GMS.  In  the  medium  term,  this \nwould  strengthen \nthe  GMS  countries'  collective \nintegration,  and  enhance \ncompetitiveness and economic development potential. \n \n\ntrade  and \n\nIII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\n12. \nThe original project is described in the Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Administration of Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia \nfor the Greater Mekong Subregion: Rehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project (footnote \n8). \n \nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\nCambodia\u2019s road transport system is inefficient because of inadequate modal and route \n13. \ncompetition.  Improving  the  sector\u2019s  efficiency  requires  increasing  the  diversity  of  transport \noptions, which would give shippers and passengers alternatives to existing routes and modes of \ntransport. Rail can be a highly competitive option, because its cost structure differs substantially \nfrom  transport  by  road  and  sea.  The  differences  in  cost  structure  would  make  it  difficult  to \nestablish  and  maintain  cross-modal  collusion  between  road  and  rail  transport  operators. \nGeographically,  rail  would  also  be  an  efficient  competitor  because  the  railway  runs  parallel  to \nthe  country\u2019s  busiest  highways\u2014National  Roads  3,  4,  and  5\u2014and  serves  two  international \nconnection  points\u2014one  at  the  Sihanoukville  port  and  another  at  Poipet  on  the  border  with \nThailand. The railway is also connected to the Mekong River via the river port in Phnom Penh. \nThese  links  would  enable  multimodal  integration  that  could  form  the  basis  for  efficient \ndistribution  of  bulk  commodities  to  northeastern  and  northwestern  Cambodia.  The  scope  for \n\n\fimprove \n\nRehabilitating \n\nthe  railway  would  substantially \n\nadditional  railway  traffic  is  substantial.  The  restructuring  study\u2019s  traffic  forecast  predicts  that \ndemand for railway freight traffic on average will grow by about 7.0% per year, significantly more \nthan the expected economic growth of 5.5% per year over the loan repayment period. \n \nThe  railway  is  in  poor  physical  condition  because  of  war  damage  and  decades  of \n14. \nneglect.  The  last  48  km  of  track  to  the  border  with  Thailand  were  destroyed  during  the  war. \nRailway traffic is declining because of the poor condition of track and equipment, which renders \nthe  railway  increasingly unreliable  and  slow.  Meanwhile,  the  road  network  has  been  improved \nsubstantially since 1995. Railway employees are underpaid, and professional skills and staffing \nlevels are deteriorating. As a result, the railway is operating at a deficit. Neither the railway nor \nthe government has the resources required to turn the railway around. Without the project, the \nrailway could cease to operate within a decade. \n \n15. \nthe  efficiency  and  cost-\neffectiveness of Cambodia\u2019s transport system by enabling efficient and safe haulage of heavy, \nbulky, and hazardous cargo, such as cement, containers, and fuel. The main benefits would be \n(i) lower cost of transport for heavy and bulky freight; (ii) less road maintenance because of the \ndecrease in heavy truck traffic; (iii) fewer road hazards because of the decrease in heavy traffic \nand the diversion of hazardous materials away from crowded roads that pass through numerous \ndensely populated towns and villages; and (iv) efficient access to import and export markets via \nthe Thai border in Poipet, the port in Sihanoukville, and the inland waterway system connecting \nPhnom  Penh  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  and  Mekong  Delta  ports.  Realizing  these \nbenefits  requires  rehabilitating  the  railway\u2019s  infrastructure,  reconstructing  the  destroyed  track \nleading to Thailand, rehabilitating the line to Phnom Penh\u2019s river port, and restructuring railway \noperations and maintenance on a commercial basis. \n \n16. \nThe  government  gives  high  priority  to  rehabilitating  and  restructuring  the  railway  as  a \nway  to  improve  Cambodia\u2019s  international  connectivity  and  competitiveness,  and  reduce  public \nsector  losses.  Cambodia\u2019s  railway  is  also  a  strategic  element  of  the  GMS  transport  sector \nstrategy\u2019s  southern  corridor,  which  connects  Cambodia,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  project \nwould  also  pave  the  way  for  the  proposed  construction  of  a  new  railway  line  between  Phnom \nPenh  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  This  new  line,  together  with  the  project  line,  would  complete  the \nSingapore\u2013Kunming railway link, which is a long-term development priority for the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n17. \nThe  objective  of  the  original  project  is  supporting  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  development \nand  strengthening  subregional  integration  by  enabling  cost-effective  and  efficient  railway \ntransport  within  Cambodia,  and  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  Malaysia,  and  Singapore. \nThe  original  project  involves  rehabilitating  or  reconstructing  the  railway  and  reestablishing  the \nrailway connection with Thailand. A private firm will operate the rehabilitated railway under a 30-\nyear concession. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe original project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $73.0 million, including taxes \n\n18. \nand duties equivalent to $7.4 million.

The  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  (OFID) \nhas provided a loan of $13 million (18%) to jointly finance the civil works component with ADB. \nADB  administers  the  OFID  loan.  The  Government  of  Malaysia  has  provided  a  grant  in kind of \nreclaimed  rails  valued at  the  equivalent  of  $2.8  million  (4%).  The  Government  of  Cambodia  is \nfinancing  the  equivalent  of  $15.2  million  (21%),  comprising  all  costs  for  project  administration, \ntaxes,  clearance  of  unexploded  ordinance,  compensation  of  railway  staff  in  connection  with \nrestructuring,  and  resettlement  and  land  acquisition.  The  ADB  loan  has  a  32-year  maturity, \nincluding an 8-year grace period. The annual interest rate is 1.0% during the grace period and \n1.5% over the remainder of the loan.

The restructuring consultant was mobilized in January 2006, the \nconcessionaire was selected on 30 November 2007 after international competitive bidding, and \nthe concession agreement was signed in June 2009. \n \n21. \nThe original project is restoring rail traffic by supporting rehabilitation of Cambodia's rail \nnetwork. ADB approved the project loan on 13 December 2006; the supervision consultant was \nmobilized on 14 January 2008; and the works contractor, which was awarded both rehabilitation \ncontracts for the northern line to Thailand and southern line to Sihanoukville Port, was mobilized \non 1 March 2008. The works contracts include detailed design. Because of delays in negotiating \nthe  concession  agreement,  works  were  postponed  until  the  concessionaire  was  in  place.  The \nreasons  for  this  temporary  suspension  of  works  were  twofold:  (i) to  ensure  that  the \nconcessionaire's  operational  requirements  were  adequately  reflected  during  implementation, \nand (ii) to limit the government's liabilities if the concession negotiations did not succeed. As a \nresult,  implementation  progress  was  delayed  by  about  12  months.  With  the  concession \nagreement  signed  on  12  June  2009,  work  is  now  proceeding.  Resettlement  plans  have  been \ncompleted  for  the  northern  and  southern  lines,  and  are  ready  for  implementation.  MPWT,  the \nconcessionaire, and the contractor are finalizing a time-bound plan for implementation of works. \nDetailed design for the original project is nearing completion, supply contracts for sleepers and \nother  materials  have  been  signed,  work  teams  have  been  mobilized,  and  heavy  track-laying \nequipment has been shipped into Cambodia. Physical works are expected to start in November. \nAll loan covenants have been met satisfactorily thus far (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n22. \n\nTwo lessons have been drawn from implementing this public\u2013private partnership project: \nIt  is  difficult  to  reconcile  ADB's  time-bound  loan  processing  and  implementation \n(i) \nschedules  with  a  parallel  process  of  concession  negotiations  between  a  public \nand  a  private  partner,  which  is  not\u2014and  cannot  realistically  be\u2014subjected  to \ndeadlines.  This  could  conceivably  be  resolved  if  a  mechanism  to  stop  ADB's \nprocessing  and \nintroduced,  enabling  parallel \nnegotiations to catch up with ADB's schedule as needed. \nADB  needs  to  accept  that  additional  resources  are  required  to  extensively \nfacilitate concession negotiations through mediation and other intervention. This \nhas been instrumental in securing a successful outcome of this project\u2019s public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  negotiations,  but  has  required  substantial  staff  and \nmanagement resources beyond those required for processing and administering \na traditional public sector project. \n\nimplementation  \"clock\"  was \n\n(ii) \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\nA. \n\nProposed Changes \n\n23. \nThe proposed supplementary financing would expand the scope of the original project to \nincrease  its  regional  integration  and  national  development  impacts.  The  expanded  scope  will \ninclude upgrading the railway's infrastructure to facilitate early takeoff of an integrated, railway-\nbased,  multimodal  transport  system  in  the  southern  GMS.  The  supplementary  financing  will \nprovide for the following: \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTransfer  of  freight  and  train  maintenance  operations  from  the  confined  and \ncongested  central  station  in  Phnom  Penh  to  a  new  and  much  larger  area  in \nSamrong, about 10 km west. This will be a major improvement because the new \nsite  (a) is  at  the confluence  of  the  northern  and  southern  railway  lines, which  is \noperationally ideal and reduces the need for heavy railway traffic through densely \npopulated  areas  in  central  Phnom  Penh;  (b)  has  sufficient  space  to  facilitate \nfuture  development;  and  (c) is  away  from  populated  areas  and  the  congested \ntraffic in central Phnom Penh, which already constrains the usage of and access \nto the current station.  \nSelective upgrading or strengthening of railway infrastructure to conform with the \noperational  requirements  for  the  proposed  multimodal  railway  traffic  and  the \nhigher axle load standards that are gradually being implemented in Thailand.  \nNew  spur  lines  to  the  existing  and  proposed  new  terminal  facilities.  These  are \nessential  to  effectively  integrate  existing  and  new  terminals  with  the  proposed \nrailway-based,  multimodal  transport  system.  The  concessionaire  will  undertake \nadditional upgrading of the railway's infrastructure as justified by future traffic and \nrevenues. \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nThe impact of the modified project (the original project with the proposed supplementary \n24. \nfinancing)  will  be  increased  domestic  and  regional  trade  movement  on  the  railway,  thereby \nsupporting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  be  achieved  by \ndeveloping  the  railway  in  Cambodia  into  a  provider  of  logistics  services  in  Cambodia  and \nneighboring  GMS  countries.  The  outcome  of  the  modified  project  will  be  a  railway  that  is \nsustainable and efficiently operated. \n \n25. \nThe outputs of the modified project will be (i) the existing railway line is rehabilitated and \npartially  upgraded,  enabling  safe  operations  at  an  average  mainline  speed  of  at  least \n50 km/hour;  (ii)  the  railway  link  to  Thailand  is  reconstructed;  (iii)  rail  links  to  the  Sihanoukville \nport and the port in Phnom Penh are rehabilitated and extended; (iv) freight facilities in Samrong \nand Phnom Penh are constructed; (v) affected households living within the railway's right-of-way  \nand the Samrong facility are satisfactorily compensated and assisted; and (vi) the new railway \ndepartment (paras. 33\u201334) is staffed and operational. \n \nthe  accelerated \n26. \nimplementation  of  the  business  plan  proposed  by  the  concessionaire,  the  government  has \nprioritized  the  financing  of  the  infrastructure  upgrade.  This  will,  in  turn,  jump-start  the \ndevelopment  of  an  integrated  logistics  system.  The  concessionaire  will  finance  additional \nupgrades of the railway's infrastructure as justified by future traffic and revenues. \n \n27. \nThe design and monitoring framework for the modified project builds on the design and \nmonitoring  framework  of  the  original  project,  and  reflects  the  additional  project  benefits  and \noutcomes of the modified project. For the supplementary financing, the framework identifies the \noutcomes  related  to  the  effective  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  railway  under  a  30-year \nconcession,  and  the  institutional  support  needed  to  monitor  the  concession  and  to  develop  a \nfuture  regulatory  framework.  In  addition,  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  highlights  the \nimportance  of  social  impacts  by  focusing  on  outcomes  related  to  the  effective  implementation \nand monitoring of resettlement and compensation plans, including issues related to gender and \nvulnerable  groups.  To  effectively  monitor  project  outcomes,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework  and  project  baselines  must  be  established;  indicators  refined,  including  gender \n\nthe  potential  economic  development  gains \n\nBased  on \n\nfrom \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fdisaggregation; and an efficient process for monitoring identified. The Government of Australia \nwill  finance TA  for  this  purpose,  and  to  help  ensure  that  project  outcome  monitoring  becomes \nintegrated into the Railway Department's systems (para. 50). \n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\n28. \nReflecting  the  increasing  role  of  rail  in  regional  transport  integration,  the  proposed \nsupplementary financing will (i) accelerate the development of the railway in Cambodia into an \nintegrated, regional logistics services provider, effectively interconnecting Cambodia, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam; and (ii) transform Cambodia into a subregional transport hub. This will provide for \nearly realization of the commitment that GMS leaders made at the 2008 summit in Vientiane to \nexpand the corridor network through multimodal links in the GMS. It will also be an example of \nimplementing  ADB's  Strategy  2020, 11  which  commits  ADB  to  pursuing  inclusive  growth, \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  regional  integration  by  leveraging  three  of  the \nstrategy's five drivers for change: (i) private sector development and private sector operations, \n(ii) good  governance  and  capacity  development,  and  (iii) partnerships  with  the  private  sector. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  financing  will  generate  significant  subregional  development \nbenefits  in  the  southern  GMS,  and  will  create  new  economic  development  opportunities  in \nCambodia. \n \nThe  activities  to  be  financed  by  the  proposed  supplementary  financing  are  technically \n29. \nfeasible,  institutionally  sound,  economically  viable  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \n20.7%,  and  financially  sustainable  with  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  about  9.2%.  The \nrequirements  for  supplementary  financing  of  incremental  activities  have  been  met:  (i) the \nproposed incremental activities are consistent with the current country partnership strategy and \nthe  development  objectives  of  the  original  project,  and  increase  its  impact,  outcomes,  and \ndevelopment  effectiveness;  and  (ii)  the  original  project  has  made  satisfactory  implementation \nprogress, including full compliance with all loan covenants due thus far (para. 21), and is likely \nto attain its development objectives. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  supplementary  financing  follows  the  principles  outlined  in  the  summary  poverty \n30. \nreduction  and  social  strategy  for  the  original  rehabilitation  project,  including  resettlement \nactivities, HIV prevention, and project-related gender issues. The modified project will result in \nadditional  resettlement  impacts  at  Samrong  because  of  the  construction  of  a  new  freight  and \nmaintenance  facility.  An  additional  232  affected  households12 have  been  identified  at  this  site, \nbringing  the  total  number  to  about  1,700.  This  impact  is  addressed  in  a  supplementary \nresettlement  plan  for  Samrong  (Appendix  4)  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  agreed \nresettlement plan for the original project. \n \n31. \nGender issues are integrated into the project primarily through the resettlement and HIV \nprograms.  Specific  strategies  for  integrating  gender  equality  include  representation  by  women \nand  men  from  affected  households  in  resettlement  working  groups  and  special  measures  in \nrelation to vulnerable groups. Gender sensitization training will also be undertaken, particularly \nin  the  context  of  resettlement,  for  pertinent  MPWT  staff  and  district  resettlement  committees, \ndistrict  officials,  and  commune  leaders.  For  HIV  prevention  activities,  the  civil  works  contracts \ncontain  provisions  that  the  contractor  must  comply  with.

Specifically,  the  contractor  is \nrequired  to  put  in  place  an  HIV  awareness  program  through  an  approved  service  provider  to \nreduce the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, promote early diagnosis, and provide \nassistance  to  affected  households.  Under  the  proposed  outcome  monitoring  TA  (para.  50), \ngender-disaggregated  monitoring  indicators  will  be  developed  to  monitor  social  benefits,  HIV, \neconomic opportunities, livelihoods, and resettlement outcomes. An updated summary poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  reflecting  the  supplementary  activities  is  in  Appendix  5.  The \nupdated  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement.13 \n \n32. \nThe railway alignment is outside environmentally sensitive areas, such as national parks \nand  other  protected  areas  and  their  buffer  zones.  The  original  project  falls  into  environmental \ncategory B, which remains valid for the modified project. MPWT has prepared a supplementary \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) identifying environmental impacts, mitigation measures, \nand  monitoring  activities  for  components  that  will  receive  supplementary  financing.  The  IEE \ncovers affected areas in Samrong and sites where an additional spur line will be established. No \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  to  arise  from  project  implementation  as \nappropriate  engineering  and  environmental  management  measures  will  be  employed.  MPWT, \nwith support from the construction supervision consultant, will ensure proper implementation of \nsuch  measures.  The  summary  IEE  for  the  supplementary  activities  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Support and Capacity Building \n\nThe success of the project will depend on the success of both its parts: (i) the physical \n33. \nrehabilitation  of  the  railway\u2019s  infrastructure,  and  (ii) the  effective  implementation  of  the \nconcession through which the railway will be managed and operated for the next 30 years. TA \nprovided  to  MPWT  (footnote  9)  and  its  concession  management  committee  (CMC)  has \nsupported  implementation  of  the  concession.  This  support  will  continue  until  mid-2010. \nHowever,  the  CMC  will  continue  to  require  expert  assistance  in  developing  sustainable \ninstitutional  capacity  to  manage  the  concession  through  the  life  of  the  contract,  and  also  to \neventually  become  the  railway  sector  regulator.  The  CMC  will  need  additional  advisory  and \ncapacity  development  support  for  at  least  2\u20133  more  years,  until  a  substantial  portion  of  the \nrailway has been rehabilitated and railway operations have settled into their long-term pattern. \nThe government has started this process by issuing a sub-decree that will (i) dissolve the Royal \nRailways of Cambodia, (ii) transfer the Royal Railways staff to MPWT, and (iii) establish the new \nrailway department within MPWT. The sub-decree became effective on 15 November 2009. \n \n34. \nThe scope of this additional support, outlined in Appendix 6, will include assisting MPWT \nwith (i) transforming the CMC from an ad hoc committee into a permanent railway department \nwithin  MPWT;  (ii) defining  the  management  and  staffing  structure  for  the  new  department; \n(iii) monitoring  the  concession;  (iv) preparing  training  programs  and  manuals  for  the  railway \ndepartment\u2019s  operations,  including  safety  monitoring,  financial  management,  international \nrelations  (for  the  rail  links  with  Thailand  and,  in  the  longer  term,  Viet  Nam),  non-concession \nasset management, and infrastructure and rolling stock inspection. \n \nF. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\nThe  supplementary  financing  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $68.6 \n35. \nmillion,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  about  $7.5  million.  This  will  push  the  total  cost  for  the \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement.

In addition, the Government of Australia will provide financing for the TA. The Government \nof Cambodia will finance the equivalent of $5.1 million (7.4%), comprising part of the civil works \ncosts  and  resettlement  and  land  acquisition.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a  32-year  maturity, \nincluding an 8-year grace period. The annual interest rate will be 1.0% during the grace period \nand 1.5% over the remainder of the loan. The borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Revised Financing Plan \n\nSupplementary \nFinancing \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n\nOriginal Project \n\n \n\n \n\nModified Project \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Australiaa \nOFID \nGovernment of Malaysia \n(grant in kind) \nGovernment of Cambodia \nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n42.0 \n0.0 \n13.0 \n\n2.8 \n\n15.2 \n73.0 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n57.6 \n0.0 \n17.8 \n\n3.8 \n\n20.8 \n100.0 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n42.0 \n21.5 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n5.1 \n68.6 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n84.0 \n21.5 \n13.0 \n\n2.8 \n\n20.3 \n141.6 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n59.3 \n15.2 \n9.2 \n\n2.0 \n\n14.3 \n100.0 \n\n61.2 \n31.3 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n7.4 \n100.0 \n\nOFID = OPEC Fund for International Development. \na   Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the Government of \n\nthe Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank, and administered by ADB. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nH. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe \n\nimplementation  arrangements  set  out \n\n37. \nthe  original  project\u2019s  report  and \nrecommendation  of  the  President  will  largely  apply  to  the  modified  project.  The  MPWT  will \nremain the executing agency for the project. The only change is that the government has invited \nthe concessionaire to join the project implementation team to ensure that works are prioritized \nand implemented in a way that maximizes the future usability of the railway infrastructure for the \nconcessionaire  and  minimizes  adverse  impact  on  rail  operations  during  construction.  This \ninvolvement includes participation in all construction and project planning meetings, and access \nto the implementing agency's project data and reports. \n\nin \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe original project was scheduled to be implemented over 3 years, with completion in \n38. \nDecember 2009. However, because negotiation of the concession agreement took longer than \nexpected, the implementation schedule will be extended by 3.5 years with completion in March \n2013.  The  extension  takes  into  account  the  impact  of  the  1-year  delay  in  negotiating  the \nconcession  agreement  and  allows  sufficient  time  for  implementing  the  additional  works  under \nthe proposed supplementary financing. The revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n39.  Works similar to those included in the scope of the original contracts, such as structures, \ntrack  strengthening,  and  additional  sidings,  which  typically  are  within  areas  covered  by  the \noriginal  contracts,  will  be  implemented  through  variations  to  those  contracts.  These  works  are \nestimated  to  cost  about  $30  million.  The  variations  will  be  prepared  and  formalized  in \naccordance with the provisions of the civil works conditions of contract. MPWT, assisted by the \nexisting project consultant, will manage the process, which will be reviewed before finalization \nby  a  procurement  specialist  provided  through  TA  (para.  52).  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  contract \nvariations,  based  on  the  procurement  specialist\u2019s  review,  will  be  required  before  their \nfinalization. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f40.  Works  of  a  different  type  to  those  included  in  the  original  contracts\u2014principally \ndevelopment  of  the  Samrong  facility\u2014will  be  implemented  through  two  new  contracts.  These \nworks include the earthworks platform, buildings, facilities and equipment, road works, and track \nwork  within  the  Samrong  site.  The  estimated  cost  is  about  $20  million.  The  contracts  will  be \nseparate from, but interfaced with, the existing contracts managed by MPWT and supervised by \nthe project consultant. There will also be a supply contract for the provision of rail and sleepers \nfor the Samrong facility, and for replacement of sections on the northern line where detailed site \ninspections have found the original rail to be unusable. All new contracts will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding. \n\n41. \nAll  new  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Details  of  the  new  contracts  are  in \nAppendix 9. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  works  under  the  proposed  supplementary  financing  will  require  an  additional  105 \n42. \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  an  additional  210  person-months  of \nnational consultant inputs from the supervision consultant. These inputs will be provided through \na  variation  to  the  existing  project  consultant\u2019s  contract.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  project \nconsultant  will  be  amended  to  include  design,  procurement,  and  supervision  of  the  Samrong \nfacility works. \n\n43. \nConsulting  services  will  also  be  required  for  the  institutional  support  and  capacity \nbuilding  of  MPWT  (para.  33).  These  services  will  extend  over  3  years  and  require  about \n60 person-months  of  international  consultants  and  20  person-months  of  national  consultants. \nThese  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  restructuring  government  railway  enterprises,  human \nresource development, railway operations and safety, and private sector concession monitoring. \nAn  outline  of  the  scope  of  the  services  is  in  Appendix  10.  The  government  will  select  the \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time),  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  with  a  quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20 and full technical proposals. \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MPWT.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB  or  the  Government  of  Australia  in  connection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MPWT  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. In \naddition,  to  promote  transparency  and  good  governance,  the  government  has  agreed  to \nestablish  a  website  for  procurement  under  the  project.  Access  to  this  website  will  be  made \navailable to the public. MPWT will publicly disclose on the website information on how proceeds \nfrom  the  ADB  loan  and  the  grant  of  the  Government  of  Australia  (administered  by  ADB)  are \nbeing used by presenting detailed information on the procurement process, including the list of \nparticipating  bidders,  the  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  of  the  bidding  procedures \nadopted, the amount of the contract awarded,  the list of the goods and services procured, and \nintended and actual utilization of ADB loan and Government of Australia grant proceeds under \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\neach  contract  in  English  and  Khmer.  This  information  will  also  be  published  on  public  notice \nboards at commune centers and other public buildings in the project area. A good governance \nframework  for  the  project  (Appendix  11)  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to be signed by the government.  \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n45. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan and the grant from the Government of Australia, if \napproved, will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  Australian  contribution  would  be  disbursed  from  budgetary \nallocations in Australian financial years 2009 to 2012,14 with the bulk of the funding likely being \navailable  in  the  last  2  years  of  this  period.  Reflecting  this,  ADB\u2019s  project  documentation, \nincluding  the  loan  agreement,  has  been  structured  to  accommodate  variable  year-by-year \nfinancing  shares  for  the  Government  of  Australia  and  ADB.  The  financing  shares  will  be \nadjusted once a year, on 1 July, and be valid for all withdrawals for the following 12 months. The \nestimated  annual  disbursement  percentages  are  in  Appendix  7,  Table  A7.3.  The  Ministry  of \nEconomy  and  Finance  (MEF)  will  establish  an  imprest  account  at  the  National  Bank  of \nCambodia  for  disbursement  of  ADB's  share  of  resettlement  costs.  MEF  will  delegate \nadministration  of  the  account  to  MPWT  by  means  of  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nDeposits  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  to  be  paid  from  the \nimprest  account  for  the  next  6  months  of  project  implementation  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount, \nwhichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nagreed  upon  between  the  borrower  and  ADB.  A  statement  of  expenditure  will  be  used  to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances to the imprest account to ensure speedy \nproject implementation. The ceiling for statements of expenditure will be $100,000 per invoice. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n46. \nThe  MPWT  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  project,  including  assets,  and  will \nhave  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  an  external  auditor \nacceptable to ADB in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. Within 6 months \nof the end of each fiscal year, MPWT will submit certified copies of audited project accounts and \nfinancial  statements  and  the  auditor's  reports,  in  English,  to  ADB.  The  audit  of  the  financial \nstatements  will  include  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control \nsystems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  and  (ii)  an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB\u2019s project management requirements. \n\n47.  MPWT  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation by submitting quarterly progress reports, the form and content of which will be \nagreed  with  ADB.  MPWT  will  monitor  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation  schedule  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant  deviations  from  the \nschedule.  The  quarterly  report  will  include  basic  data  on  utilization  of  funds,  achievement  of \nimmediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation progress, land \nacquisition, resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion,  MPWT  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  that  will  provide  a  detailed \nevaluation of the project design, costs, performance by contractors and consultants, social and \neconomic impact, economic rate of return, and other details that ADB may request. \n\n                                                 \n14  The  financial  year  of  the  Government  of  Australia  ends  on  30  June,  e.g.,  financial  year  2009  ends  on  30  June \n\n2010. \n\n \n\n\f8. \n\nProject Review \n\n48. \nADB  staff,  with  the  participation  of  representatives  from  the  governments  of  Cambodia \nand  Australia,  will  undertake  a  semiannual  review  of  the  project  to  assess  (i)  the  status  of \nimplementation,  (ii)  the  performance  of  the  government  and  the  concessionaire,  (iii)  the \nperformance  of  consultants  and  contractors,  (iii)  the  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants \nstipulated  in  the  loan  agreement,  and  (iv)  the  need  for  any  changes  in  the  project  scope  or \nschedule  to  achieve  the  project\u2019s  impact  and  objectives.  These  reviews  will  be  supported  by \nconsultants  with  appropriate  expertise,  in  particular  for  the  project\u2019s  critical  and  sensitive \ninvoluntary resettlement activity. A midterm review will be undertaken in 2011. In addition to the \nissues covered during regular project reviews, the midterm review will assess the impacts of the \nproject,  and  the  progress  in  developing  the  new  railway  department\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  the \nconcession and regulate the railway sector. \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nTA for Outcome Monitoring and Procurement Review (Appendix 10) will be provided to \n49. \nMPWT for (i) outcome monitoring; and (ii) procurement review for the works to be added to the \nproject scope through variations to the existing contracts. This will be done through a single TA \nproject  with  two  parts  corresponding  to  these  tasks.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $0.45 \nmillion. The Government of Australia will finance the TA from its proposed grant for the project. \nADB  will  administer  the  TA.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.15 \n\nA. \n\nOutcome Monitoring \n\n50. \nTA  for  outcome  monitoring  will  be  provided  through  MPWT\u2019s  CMC  (or  subsequent \nrailway department), which will also undertake long-term output monitoring as required by ADB \nand the governments of Australia and Cambodia. These services will extend over 2 years, after \nwhich  outcome  monitoring  will  be  integrated  into  MPWT\u2019s  systems.  Outcome  monitoring  will \ncover  (i)  an  overview  of  economic  and  transport  benefits  monitoring  as  outlined  in  the  design \nand monitoring framework; (ii) social benefits by  focusing on outcomes related to the effective \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  resettlement  and  compensation  plans,  including  issues \nrelated  to  gender  and  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iii)  institutional  benefits  focusing  on  improved \nrailway organizational systems. Outcome monitoring will take an integrated approach and build \non  the  project-level  monitoring  taking  place  through  work  of  MPWT,  the  contractor,  and  the \nproject consultant. \n\n51. \nThis part of the TA will require about 8 person-months of international consultants and \n16 person-months of national consultants. These consultants will have expertise in developing \nmonitoring and evaluation frameworks; managing monitoring and evaluation systems, including \ngender disaggregation, data collection, analysis and reporting on activities, and outcomes and \nimpacts;  and  experience  in  training  national  staff  in  the  management  of  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems. A consulting firm will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  procedure  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20  and  simplified  technical \nproposals. \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nB. \n\nProcurement Review \n\n52. \nThis  part  of  the  TA  will  assist  MPWT  and  ADB  with  ensuring  that  the  process  of \ndeveloping,  negotiating,  and  agreeing  on  contract  variations  is  carried  out  appropriately  and \nproduces a reasonable result. A substantial portion of the additional works to be introduced will \nbe  carried  out  under  these  variations  to  the  existing  contracts.  The  task  will  require  about \n1 month of consulting services, provided by an individual international procurement specialist. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n53. \nThe  benefits  and  impacts  of  the  modified  project  were  assessed  along  with  potential \nrisks associated with the assumptions made in the project design. The combined benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n\nA. \n\nSocial \n\nThe  principles  for  addressing  social  and  gender  issues  set  out  in  the  original  project \n54. \nwere developed as part of an overall integrated approach for addressing resettlement activities, \nHIV awareness and prevention and gender equality issues. The original socioeconomic survey \nindicated that the project is not expected to affect ethnic minority groups any differently than the \nmajority  Khmers.  Thus,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  is  not  triggered.  Gender \nequity issues are integrated across the project through resettlement, HIV activities, and project \nmonitoring.  The  modified  project  includes  the  following  actions  to  address  gender  issues  in \nresettlement: (i) a male representative and a female representative of the affected households \nin a commune will sit in the resettlement working group; and (ii) sensitization training on gender \nand  on  the  project  resettlement  policy  will  be  provided  to  MPWT  personnel  and  the  working \ngroup through the project consultant\u2019s resettlement specialist. With regard to HIV, the civil works \ncontractors  are  required  to  develop  and  implement  an  awareness  and  prevention  campaign \nduring the construction period for both workers and communities. In terms of project monitoring, \nmonitoring indicators disaggregated by gender will be developed for monitoring social benefits, \nHIV, economic opportunities, livelihoods, and resettlement outcomes. \n\nB. \n\nResettlement \n\n55. \nThe  original  project  was  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks  related  to  involuntary \nresettlement.  The  agreed  upon  resettlement  plan  is  being  updated  following  the  completion  of \ndetailed  design.  The  modified  project  will  result  in  additional  resettlement  impacts at  Samrong \nbecause  of  the  construction  of  a  new  freight  facility.  The  total  land  area  is  98.6  hectares.  An \nadditional 232 affected households have been identified. The draft resettlement plan has been \nfinalized. The government has held public consultation meetings; distributed public information \nbooklets  in  the  Khmer  language  to  all  affected  households;  and placed  copies  of  the \nresettlement plan, translated into Khmer language, in the affected commune offices. \n\nC. \n\nConnection with Thailand \n\nThe prime ministers of Cambodia and Thailand agreed in 2007 to reestablish the cross-\n56. \nborder  railway  connection,  and \ntechnical  discussions  on \nimplementation  arrangements.  The  talks  were  halted  while  the  Cambodian  concession \nagreement  was  being  negotiated  in  2008  to  enable  proper  involvement  of  the  new  railway \noperator. Following the signing of the concession agreement on 12 June 2009, the Cambodian \nminister of public works and transport intends to reopen this process. ADB is providing support \n\ntwo  railways  undertook \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\ffor  these  discussions  through  the  ongoing  TA  project  for  restructuring  of  the  railway,  and \nthrough its resident missions in Cambodia and Thailand. \n\nD. \n\nFinancial \n\n57. \nThe financial analysis of the modified project indicates that it will have a financial internal \nrate  of  return  of  about  9.2%,  well  above  the  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  the \nmodified project of about 2.9%. The revised financial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n58. \nThe  financial  management  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  was  assessed  during \npreparation  of  the  original  loan  and  remains  valid.  MPWT  has  a  long-standing  record  of \nsatisfactorily  implementing  ADB  projects.  The  financial  management  capacity  of  the  private \nconcessionaire was assessed during bidding for the concession agreement, where it was one of \nthe prequalification criteria, and showed the operator had more than adequate financial capacity \nto undertake the concession. This assessment also remains valid. \n\nE. \n\nEconomic \n\n59. \nThe main benefits in the original project are associated with savings from the diversion \nof heavy freight and container traffic from road transport to more economical rail transport. The \nmain  benefit  from  the  supplementary  financing  is  from  subregional  traffic  using  the  railway's \ncheaper  and  faster  subregional  links.  The  traffic  forecast  in  the  original  project  is  based  on \nprojected  future  economic  growth  in  Cambodia.  It  assumes  that  the  railway  will  capture  a \nsignificant share of the traffic generated by three new cement plants that are being planned and \nconstructed,  as  well  as  future  container  traffic  on  the  southern  line  to  and  from  Sihanoukville. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  modified  project  considers  projected  railway  traffic  in  Cambodia \nand the additional transit traffic as a result of the concessionaire\u2019s business plan, as well as the \nimpact  of  additional  railway  infrastructure  investments.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  modified \nproject  shows  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  will  be  about  20.8%.  The  revised \neconomic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental \n\n60. \nThe railway alignment is outside environmentally sensitive areas, such as national parks \nand other protected areas and their buffer zones. The project falls into environmental category \nB. The additional works to be implemented under the modified project do not introduce new or \nsignificantly different environmental impacts, since they are largely contained within or close to \nthe  areas  already  assessed  under  the  original  project\u2019s  IEE.  The  site  for  the  new  Samrong \nfacility  consists  of  paddy  fields  and  grassland  with  sparsely  populated  areas  nearby.  Other \ncomponents involve the rehabilitation of existing sidings and construction of short new sidings \n(500\u2013800  meters)  about  50  meters  from  the  existing  main  line.  MPWT  has  performed  further \nenvironmental  examination  of  the  additional  works  and  submitted  the  draft  IEE  report  to  ADB. \nADB has submitted comments on the draft IEE. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the government and the MPWT have given the \n\n61. \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\n2. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n3. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEnvironment and Social \n\nto  ensure \n\n(a) comply  with \n\nthat  contractors \n\nThe  government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  under  the  project \nincorporate  provisions \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s  environmental  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  the \nenvironmental management plan for the project, and the IEE; (b) comply with all \napplicable  laws  and  regulations  of  Cambodia,  including  ratified  international \ntreaty  obligations;  (c) do  not  employ  child  labor  and  provide  safe  working \nconditions  for  male  and  female  workers;  (d) do  not  provide  male  and  female \nworkers with different wages or benefits for work of equal value to the extent that \nit is applicable to contractors; and (e) carry out training programs and awareness \ncampaigns on HIV at campsites and in communities along the railway lines. The \nMPWT will monitor compliance through the project consultant. \n\nResettlement \n\nThe  government  will  ensure  that  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  (IRC) \nupdates  the  resettlement  plan  after  detailed  project  design  based  on  a  detailed \nmeasurement survey of losses. The assignments of the independent monitoring \nagency and the project consultant\u2019s resettlement specialists already engaged for \nthe original project will be expanded to also include monitoring and supervision at \nSamrong.  The  update  will  be  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  affected \nhouseholds and will be disclosed to them through relevant commune offices. The \nupdated resettlement plan for any section of the railway will be submitted to ADB \nfor  review  and  approval  before  commencement  of  any  land  acquisition  and \nrelocation  activities  for  that  section.  IRC  will  implement  the  approved,  updated \nresettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  the  government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and \nprocedures  and  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  In  the  case  of \ndiscrepancies between the government\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures and \nADB's policy, ADB's policy will prevail. \nCivil works contractors will not be issued a notice of possession of the pertinent \nsection of railway until (a) the satisfactory completion of compensation payments \nand relocation to new sites for that particular section, (b) the agreed rehabilitation \nfrom  all \nassistance \nencumbrances. \nThe  government  will  ensure  that  if  people  in  the  remaining  right-of-way  beyond \nthe corridor of impact are resettled in the future, the resettlement will be carried \nout in accordance with the standards established for this project. \nThe  government  will  ensure  the  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement  to  meet  any  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement \nbudget estimates to satisfy resettlement requirements and objectives. \n\nthe  particular  section \n\nin  place,  and  (c) \n\nfree \n\nis \n\nis \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Good Governance \n\n(1998,  as  amended \n\nThe  government  will  comply  with,  and  will  cause  MPWT  to  comply  with,  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy \nto  date).  The  government \n(a) acknowledges  ADB\u2019s  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project; \nand (b) agrees to cooperate fully with, and to cause the MPWT to cooperate fully \nwith,  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including \nproviding access to all relevant accounts and records, as may be necessary for \nthe satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \nWithout  limiting  the  generality  of  the  preceding  paragraph,  the  government  will \n(a) ensure that the MPWT conducts periodic inspections of contractors\u2019 activities \n\n\f(iii) \n\n4. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n5. \n\n(i) \n\nrelated  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (b) ensure  and  cause  the \nMPWT  to  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  or  financed  by  the \nGovernment of Australia and administered by ADB in connection with the project \ninclude  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the project. \nIn addition to these requirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency, \nthe government will set up a website to disclose information about procurements \nrelated  to  the  project.  For  each  contract,  the  website  will  include  a  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  the  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  the  basic  details  of  the \nbidding  procedures  adopted,  the  amount  of  the  contract  awarded,    the  list  of \ngoods,  works  or  services  procured,  and  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  ADB \nloan and Government of Australia grant proceeds. In addition to the web-based \ndisclosure,  the  public  shall  be  provided  with  detailed  information  about \nprocurement on public notice boards (for example, at commune council facilities) \nin the area where works are carried out for the project. \n\nGender  \n\nThe  government  will  ensure  that  women,  in  particular,  those  who  belong  to \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  and  ethnic  minority  groups,  participate  to  an \nextent  satisfactory  to  ADB  in  (a)  public  consultation  meetings  on  resettlement \nplanning;  (b)  detailed  measurement  survey;  (c)  capacity  development  programs \nrelating  to  resettlement;  and  (d)  relocation,  compensation,  and  livelihood \nimprovement activities to be undertaken under the project. \nThe  government  will  ensure  that  (a) any  land  rights  granted  to  affected  people \nwill  be  issued  in  the  names  of  both  husband  and  wife;  (b) women  railway  staff \naffected  by  restructuring  are  included  in  counseling  and  retraining  programs  for \nsecuring  employment  opportunities;  and  (c) gender  sensitization  training  is \nundertaken as part of supervision consulting services, particularly in the context \nof  resettlement,  for  pertinent  MPWT  staff  and  district  resettlement  committees, \ndistrict officials, and commune leaders. \n\nProject Monitoring \n\nAt the beginning of project implementation, the MPWT will establish baseline and \ntarget  values  for  the  indicators  before  the  start  of  works.  The  indicators  shall \ninclude,  at  a  minimum,  information  on  railway  passenger  and  freight  traffic; \neffective  average  train  speed;  container  traffic;  traffic  accidents;  railway,  road, \nand sea transport costs; heavy traffic on the railway versus roads; and producer \nprices  as  a  share  of  the  value  of  exports.  The  indicators  shall  be  measured  at \nproject  inception,  project  completion,  and  3  years  after  project  completion  and \ncompared  with  baseline  values.  Support  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation system will be provided as part of supervision consulting services, and \nthrough \ninclude \ntechnical  assistance.  The  main  sources  of  data  shall \n(a) secondary  data  from  the  borrower\u2019s  sources,  (b) traffic  counts,  (c) railway \nstatistics,  (d) shipper  and  passenger  surveys,  (e) traffic  accident  database, \n(f) producer and price surveys, and (g) trade and customs statistics. The MPWT \nshall  submit  a  report  to  ADB  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at \ninception, project completion, and 3 years after project completion. \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Effectiveness \n\n62. \nthe proposed ADB supplementary loan. \n \n\nApproval of the grant from the Government of Australia is a condition for effectiveness of \n\nVIII.

The first stage encompasses restructuring and rehabilitation of the railway with \nsupport  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The  second,  medium-term  stage  is \nextending the railway to the border with Viet Nam to complete the Singapore Kunming Railway \nLink, which currently is in the feasibility study stage with support from the People's Republic of \nChina  (PRC).  The  third,  long  term,  stage  is  developing  the  railway  network  with  new  lines, \npossibly to Siem Reap, northeastern Cambodia and ultimately Laos. \n\nB. \n\nMajor Development Partners \n\n2. \nThe  main  development  partners  in  the  railway  subsector  are  ADB  and  Australia.  The \ngovernment  of  Australia  is  cofinancing  the  supplementary  financing  for  rehabilitation  of  the \nrailway and is supporting its organizational restructuring. PRC is financing a feasibility study for \nthe proposed new line to Loch Ninh on the border with Viet Nam. Other development partners in \nthe  railway  subsector  are  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  and  Malaysia,  which  are \ncofinancing the original project for rehabilitation of the railway.

The three international airports (Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville), the two \nmain ports (Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville), and the primary highway network will soon be fully \nrehabilitated  and  have  adequate  capacity.  However,  the  railway  is  run-down  and  needs  to  be \nrehabilitated and restructured to become an efficient alternative. Restructuring is under way and \nrehabilitation is expected to start in 2009. \n\nNevertheless,  much  remains  to  be  done  in  the  transport  sector  to  support  continued \n\n4. \neconomic and social development:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nMost  provincial  and  rural  roads  are  seasonally  impassable  to  motorized  traffic \nand await rehabilitation.  \nInland  water  transport  has  progressed  slowly,  driven  by  the  private  sector,  but \ninfrastructure  such  as  river  ports  needs  to  be  upgraded  and  modernized  to \neffectively support multimodal transport.  \nDomestic  airports  require  repair  and  an  assured  financial  basis  to  provide  safe \noperations.  \nTraffic regulation and enforcement is weak or nonexistent, and lack a sound legal \nbasis, although a draft road law has been prepared with support from the World \nBank.  \nfinanced,  but \nInfrastructure  development \nshortages  of  funds  and  a  lack  of  efficient  and  transparent  mechanisms  for \nmaintenance  planning,  disbursement,  and  execution  hinder  its  operation  and \nmaintenance.  \nTransport services are inefficient, partly because of poor infrastructure and partly \nbecause of market failure and rent-seeking. \n\nis  mostly  development  partner \n\n5. \nThe  constraints  to  infrastructure  development  are  (i) a  shortage  of  qualified  and \nexperienced  professional  staff  that  is  only  slowly  abating,  and  (ii) growing  but  still  inadequate \ngovernment  funding  for  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance.  The  private  sector  can \nbecome a larger source of financing and management capacity in certain infrastructure areas, \nnotably the railway, the sea and river ports, and new terminal facilities such as container depots. \nIn other areas, such as road infrastructure, private sector involvement is currently feasible only \non a few roads because traffic levels elsewhere are too low to support toll-financed investment \nand maintenance.1 \n\nThe  execution  of  safeguard  policies,  especially  resettlement,  compensation,  and \n6. \nrehabilitation of those adversely impacted, has improved significantly in recent years. However, \nthere is still room for further improvement, especially through the establishment of a firm legal \nbasis for resettlement, compensation, and rehabilitation, and of consistent implementation. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing technical assistance in this regard.2 \n\n                                                 \n1   The  complex  and  interlinked  issues  of  road  maintenance  funding,  planning,  disbursement,  and  execution  are \ndiscussed  extensively  in  ADB.  2002.  Strengthening  the  Maintenance  Capacity  Planning  and  Maintenance \nManagement Capabilities at the Ministry of Public Works and Transport in Cambodia. Manila. (TA 3257-CAM). \n2   ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework \n\nand Institutional Capacity. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\n \n\nPast infrastructure projects employed international contractors and consultants, and had \n7. \nlittle development impact in terms of spurring the emergence of national contractors, consulting \nengineers,  and  other  service  providers.  This  is  expected  to  change  soon  after  the  Ministry  of \nPublic  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  decided  to  introduce  private  road  contractors  for  road \nmaintenance rather than relying exclusively on force account for nationally funded projects. The \nRoad Asset Management Project,3 which is jointly funded by ADB, the Government of Australia, \nInternational  Development  Agency,  and  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  (OFID),  is \nthe test for this. \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n8. \nSince 1994, the primary tools of the government's strategy have been to (i) focus road \ninvestments on rehabilitating national highways and selected provincial, rural, and urban roads; \n(ii) undertake comprehensive privatization of transport provision; (iii) relax restrictive regulations, \nsuch as most of those on importing motor vehicles and all of those on access by foreign airlines; \nand (iv) franchise the operation, maintenance, and development of National Road 4, the three \ninternational airports (Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville), and air traffic control to the \nprivate  sector.  The  government's  strategy  has  been  successful  in  restoring  a  core  transport \nsystem that connects the country\u2019s main centers, and has significantly contributed to integrating \nthe national economy with the regional and global economies. \n\n9. \nThe  government  has  initiated  a  process  of  decentralization  and  reforms.  For  example, \nthe  delivery  of  transport  infrastructure  services,  which  had  been  centrally  managed  by  the \nMPWT,  is  now  delegated  to  the  provinces.  The  MPWT  is  shifting  its  focus  away  from  direct \nmanagement  of  transport  infrastructure  toward  planning  and  oversight  of  the  sector.  The \nprocess  is  moving  forward  with  significant  support  from  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency.  However,  it  is  encumbered  by  shortages  of  the  skills  and \nresources  required  to  undertake  these  new  roles  both  in  the  provinces  and  centrally.  For \nexample,  disbursements  for  road  maintenance  are  now  made  directly  to  the  provinces,  which \nlack the ability to produce credible road maintenance plans and adequately justified budgets. As \na  result,  road  maintenance  is  generally  poor,  even  though  uncommitted  funds  are  available. \nWith MPWT's commitment to introducing private contractors, road maintenance management is \nagain becoming the responsibility of the ministry. \n\n10. \nThe MPWT is preparing a revised strategy for future development of the transport sector \nbased  on  the  Cambodia  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study,  financed  by  ADB. 4  In  terms  of \ntransport  sector  development  and  operation,  the  draft  strategy  is  likely  to  emphasize  the \nfollowing objectives and goals: \n\n(i) \n\nSupport  sustained  economic  growth,  and  promote  external  trade  and \nforeign  direct  investment.  Transport  is  an  integral  part  of  the  production  of \nnearly  all  goods  and  services.  Good  transport  infrastructure  and  cost-effective \ntransport  is  a  precondition  for  Cambodia's  export  drive  and  for  successful \ndevelopment  of  its  tourism  potential.  It  is  also  a  major  factor  in  containing  the \ncost of living and improving rural livelihoods. A more diverse supply of transport \nservices  and  better  transport  logistics  using  multimodal  transport chains  are \nneeded \nits \nattractiveness to foreign investors. \n\ninternational  competitiveness  and \n\nimprove  Cambodia's \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2008.

Cambodia Transport Sector Strategy Study. Manila \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 3 \n\n28 \n \n\nthe  government  recognizes \n\nSupport  poverty  reduction  and  integration  of  the  country. By enabling new \nproductive  activities  in  areas  not  previously  open  to  economic  exchange, \ntransport  creates  the  foundation  for  more  inclusive  and  pro-poor  economic \ngrowth. Transport achieves this by providing cost-effective and reliable access to \neconomic  opportunities  and  social  services,  thereby  enabling  the  poor  to \nparticipate more fully in society. Accessible and dependable transport networks, \nespecially provincial roads, are needed to link the provinces and to integrate rural \nareas into the mainstream economy. \nStreamline  and  focus  sector  institutions,  and  expand  private  involvement \nin  infrastructure  provision. The government  emphasizes strengthening sector \ninstitutions,  especially  the  creation  of  clear  mandates  for  their  activities,  as  the \nbasis  for  institutional  reform  and  strengthening.  Given  the  human  resources \nin \nconstraints, \nimplementation  with  the  focus  on  efficiency,  transparency,  and\u2014whenever \nefficient\u2014reliance on the private sector. In the past, the government has shown a \nreadiness to involve foreign and domestic investors in financing, developing, and \nmanaging transport infrastructure. The government intends to pursue this avenue \nfurther,  and  also  strongly  supports  the  development  of  national  contractors  to \nundertake infrastructure construction and maintenance services. \nSecure  the  sustainability  of  transport.  Fuel  taxation  is  a  major  source  of \nrevenue for the government, and charging for the use of infrastructure has been \nintroduced in most subsectors. However, with a few exceptions, low traffic loads \nlimit  the  scope  for  charging  full  user  costs.  As  the  scope  for  direct  government \nfunding  is  equally  limited,  meeting  the  funding  requirements  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  in  the  short-  to  medium-term  will  require \nsupplementary funding from the private sector and development partners. \nImprove  safety  and  enforcement.  The  government  is  aware  of  the  rapidly \ngrowing  social  and  economic  costs  of  poor  traffic  safety  and  recognizes  that \ninefficient  enforcement\u2014because  of  a  weak  legal  foundation,  inadequate \nresources, and corrupt practices\u2014is a root cause of the problem. \n\nthat  reform  requires \n\nflexibility \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN FOR SAMRONG \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT),  the  executing  agency  for  the \n1. \nGreater Mekong Subregion: Rehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project, plans to develop \na  property  of  the  Royal  Railway  of  Cambodia  that  straddles  the  communes  of  Kakab  and \nSamrong,  Dankao  District,  into  a  railway  freight  and  cargo  railway  facility.  The  Government  of \nCambodia  acquired  this  property  in  the  1950s  for  the  use  of  the  Royal  Railway  of  Cambodia. \nThe V-shaped estate is bounded on the south by the tracks of the southern railway line, on the \nnorth  by  the  tracks  of  the  northern  railway  line,  and  on  the  west  by  Street  120-K  (traversing \nSamrong  commune).  MPWT  is  repossessing  the  land  sandwiched  between  the  northern  line \nand  southern  line  railway  tracks  plus  an  easement  corridor  of  10  meters  (m)  around  the \ncenterline of the northern and southern tracks. The aggregate land area to be repossessed is \n103.6  hectares  (ha),  a  little  more  than  the  98.6  ha  that  the  government  has  committed  to  the \nrailway  concessionaire  for  the  cargo  and  freight  railway  facility.  In  this  appendix,  the  estate  is \nreferred  to  as  Samrong  because  the  Samrong  railway  station  is  at  the  northern  tip  of  the \nproperty.  The  Samrong  railway  estate  will  be  leveled  and  developed  with  the  needed \ninfrastructure and facilities as freight and rolling stock maintenance facility. \n\n2. \nResettlement plan surveys found that 231 households, totaling about 1,270 persons and \none private company will be affected by the development of the facility.1 The inventory of losses \nand  the  socioeconomic  survey  of  affected  households  done  in  May  2009  estimated  that  of  a \ntotal land area of about 103.6 ha, about 86.94 ha of the Samrong estate is occupied or in the \npossession of the 231 households and 1 company. About 79% (68.42 ha) of this land is used for \nfarming,  particularly  for  growing  rice  and  watermelon,  while  19%  (16.32  ha)  is  used  for \nresidences. The remaining 2% (2.20 ha) is used for commerce. In addition, 62 main structures \n(56 houses and 6 shops) in the estate will be condemned. \n\nB. \n\nProject Resettlement Policy and Entitlements \n\nThe  resettlement  plan  for  the  Samrong  facility  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \n3. \nagreed October 2006 resettlement plan for the original project. The affected households will be \ncompensated and assisted depending on the type and severity of their losses, and their ability \nto rehabilitate themselves, taking into account the vulnerability of the affected households. \n\nTable A4.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nType of Impacts \nLoss of agricultural land \nuse within the railway \ncorridor of influencea \n\nNo. of Entitled \nHouseholds \n\nTo be \ndetermined \n\nEntitlements \n\nCash assistance of $0.50/m2 for loss of \nland use for agricultural land in the \ncorridor of influence.  \n\nPermanent loss of \nagricultural and \ncommercial land  \n\n175b \nhouseholds \n \n\nCash compensation at $2.75 per m2. \nStart of civil works will be coordinated \nwith the affected households to allow \nthem time to harvest their crops.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Based on an average household size of 5.5 people. \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nOutside Samrong estate, \naffected households will be \nallowed to continue to \ncultivate in the residual right \nof way for agricultural \npurposes only. \nThis rate was the prevailing \nmarket rate of land at the \nSamrong estate before the \nFebruary 2005 ban. \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 4 \n\n30 \n \n\nType of Impacts \n\nAffected land with \nstanding dwelling units \nthat are condemned and \nmust be relocated \n \n\nPartially condemned \nmain houses and shops, \nand secondary structures \n(fence, walls) \n\n \n \n\n \n\nCondemned buildings: \nmain houses and shops, \nand secondary structures \n(fence, walls) \n\n56 households \n \n \n \n\nCrops and trees \n \n\nNo. of Entitled \nHouseholds \n\n56 households   Two options offered: \n\nEntitlements \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nThis entitlement is also \nprovided to landless affected \nhouseholds who have \nestablished residence in the \nSamrong railway station. \n \n\nThe viability (stability and \nproportion) of remaining \nunaffected structures will be \ndetermined by affected \nhouseholds and local \nofficials at the time of \ndetailed measurement \nsurvey.

This  led  to  the  introduction  of  sharecroppers  to  tend  to \notherwise idle plots since most, if not all, of the outsiders who bought land in the estate were not farmers and did not \nestablish residence in the estate. \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance\u2019s Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC). \n \nC. \n\nVulnerability and Gender Issues \n\nSince  some  of  the  people  who  claim  possession  of  plots  of  land  in  the  estate  do  not \n4. \nreside  in  the  project  site,  the  survey  was  able  to  interview  only  169  heads  of  affected \nhouseholds,  of  which  120  were  men  and  49  were  women.  Of  the  120  affected  households \nheaded  by  males,  68  live  in  the  project  site  and  52  reside  elsewhere.  Similarly,  of  the  49 \naffected  households  headed  by  women,  32  live  in  the  project  site  and  17  reside  elsewhere. \nDuring the inventory of losses survey, 51 affected households were identified as vulnerable. Of \nthese, 49 affected households are headed by  women (including 2 of the sharecroppers and a \nfarming resident); 5 affected households are headed by a physically disabled person; 2 affected \nhouseholds  have  a  monthly  income  below  the  poverty  line;  and  32  affected  households  are \nheaded  by  the  elderly.  Additional  measures  are  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan  to  help \nensure  that  these  affected  households,  which  are  considered  particularly  vulnerable,  are  not \nfurther disadvantaged and benefit equally from the project. Monitoring indicators for this purpose \nhave been incorporated in the resettlement plan. \n\nD. \n\nParticipation and Grievance Redress \n\nThe participation of the public, especially the affected households, and consultations on \n5. \nthe project and resettlement will be pursued as enunciated in the 2006 approved resettlement \nplan. The survey team before and after the inventory of losses survey met with local residents \nand  affected  households  to  discuss  (i)  initially  the  proposed  project,  schedule,  and  objectives \nand  nature  of  the  survey  team\u2019s  activities;  and  (ii)  in  general  terms  project  impacts  and \nentitlements  following  the  completion  of  the  inventory  of  losses.  These  activities  will  continue \nduring  the  updating  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s \nparticipatory  approach.  The  project\u2019s  grievance  mechanism  has  been  designed  to  ensure  that \nthe concerns and complaints of the affected households are readily addressed in the villages in \na  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  The  affected  households  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  their \nrights  through  verbal  and  written  means  during  resettlement  planning,  updating,  and \nimplementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\n \n\nE. \n\nRelocation and Rehabilitation Strategy \n\n6. \nAffected  households  losing  dwelling  units,  including  those  that  have  established \nresidence  in  the  Samrong  railway  station,  will  not  be  compensated  for the  land  on which  their \nhouses  are  built.  However,  they  will  have  the  option  to  (i)  self-relocate  and  receive  cash \nassistance  of  $10,000  each;  or  (ii)  receive  a  300  m2  plot  each  in  a  relocation  site  that  will  be \ndeveloped by the government in Dankao district, free of charge and with basic amenities, such \nas  a  latrine  for  each  plot,  road  and  drainage  networks,  electricity,  and  communal  water  wells. \nThe  affected  households  may  not  sell  or  use  as  collateral  the  plots  in  the  relocation  site  for  5 \nconsecutive years, and land title for these plots will be given to the affected households after 5 \nyears  of  occupation.  The  schedule  of  delivery  of  entitlements  and  relocation,  and  the  start  of \ncivil  works,  will  also  be  discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  the  affected  households  during  the \ndisclosure meeting consultations. The affected households must be given sufficient lead time to \nfind a place to relocate and rebuild their homes and shops, including finding a replacement for \ntheir lost productive assets, before displacement. \n\nAll  severely  affected  households  will  take  part  in  the  needs  assessment  that  will  be \n7. \nconducted by project authorities during the preparation of the income-restoration program. The \nbudget  for  the  income-restoration  program  for  the  affected  households  in  Samrong  will  come \nfrom the budget of the resettlement plan for the original rehabilitation project. \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring, Resettlement Plan Budget, and Implementation Schedule \n\n8. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  (IRC),  in  close \ncollaboration  with  MPWT,  will  continue  to  serve  as  the  project\u2019s  internal  resettlement \nimplementing and monitoring agency. The IRC is responsible for submitting to MPWT and ADB \nproject  progress  reports  that  include  updates  on  the  progress  of  resettlement.  The  external \nmonitoring  agency  engaged  by  the  IRC  under  the  original  project  will  include  the  Samrong \nfacility  in  its  scope  of  work.  The  total  cost  of  resettlement  for  Samrong  is  estimated  at  $4.1 \nmillion, which includes compensation and other entitlements to be provided to eligible affected \nhouseholds,  operational  and  administrative  expenses,  and  contingencies.  MPWT  and  IRC  will \nensure  the  timely  availability  of  funds  for  resettlement,  including  unforeseen  costs  exceeding \nresettlement budget estimates to satisfy the project\u2019s resettlement objectives. \n\n9. \nThe  IRC  will  update  the  resettlement  plan  following  completion  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey.  The  updated  resettlement  plan  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval  before  it  is  implemented.  MPWT  will  not  allow  construction  activities  in  the  Samrong \nestate  to  start  until  the  affected  households  have  been  relocated  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plan. \n\nTable A4.2: Resettlement Schedule \n\nActivities \nResettlement plan preparation \nADB approval of draft resettlement plan  \nResettlement plan updating  \nSubmission and ADB approval of updated resettlement plan \nImplementation of the approved updated resettlement plan  \nInternal monitoring (submission of quarterly progress reports)\nExternal monitoring (intermittent) \nPost-resettlement evaluation \n\nSchedule \nMay\u2013June 2009 \nJuly 2009 \nAugust 2009 \nSeptember 2009 \nOctober 2009\u2013March 2010 \nAugust 2009\u2013March 2010 \nSeptember 2009\u2013March 2010 \nDecember 2010 \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 4 \n\n34 \n \n\n \nG. \n\nDisclosure of Resettlement Plan and Monitoring Documents \n\n \n10. \nThe  draft  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  before  appraisal  to  the  affected  households \nwith  the  distribution  of  project  information  leaflets  written  in  Khmer.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  government  gives  high  priority  to  rehabilitating  and  restructuring  the  railway  as  a  way  to  (i) improve  Cambodia\u2019s \ninternational  connectivity  and  competitiveness,  and  (ii) reduce  losses  in  the  public  sector.  Cambodia\u2019s  railway  is  also  a \nstrategic  element  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  transport  sector  strategy\u2019s  southern  corridor,  which  connects \nCambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The project would also pave the way for the proposed construction of a new railway line \nbetween  Phnom  Penh  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  in  Viet  Nam. This  new  line,  together  with  the  project  line,  would  complete  the \nSingapore\u2013Kunming railway link, which is a long-term development priority for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nAbout  one-third  of  Cambodia's  population  of  about  13  million  lives  in  poverty.  Much  of  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  was \ndestroyed during decades of civil war and conflict, and its socioeconomic indicators are low. Poverty is overwhelmingly rural: \n40%\u201345% of people in rural areas are poor, compared with 10%\u201315% in Phnom Penh. The incidence of poverty has declined \nonly modestly in recent years for a number of reasons, including a shortage of sources of growth and exclusion of the poor \nfrom the mainstream economy. \n  \nImproving  Cambodia\u2019s  basic  infrastructure  is  critical  for  the  country\u2019s  economic  development,  and  Cambodia  has  started \nrehabilitating  infrastructure  with  support  from  its  development  partners.  The  government-owned  railway  is  in  poor  physical \ncondition because of war damage and decades of insufficient maintenance and investment. Rail traffic is declining because of \nthe  poor  condition  of  the  tracks.  As  a  result,  the  railway  is  generating  operational  deficits.  The  purpose  of  the  project  is  to \nrestore efficient rail traffic by rehabilitating the existing railway line, reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with Thailand by \nreplacing a section to the border that was destroyed, and restructuring the railway subsector. Rehabilitation of the railway will \nfoster efficient rail freight service. It is expected that the proposed project will facilitate economic growth by providing a cost-\neffective  and  efficient  means  of  transporting  goods,  as  an  efficient  transport  system  would  increase  trade  and  jobs.  The \nproject will also facilitate subregional trade and economic growth in Cambodia and Thailand. \n  \n2. Design Features \n \nThe proposed supplementary financing would expand the scope of the original project to include an upgrading of the railway's \ninfrastructure to facilitate the early takeoff of an integrated, railway-based, multimodal transport system on a subregional scale \nin the southern GMS. The immediate works required are (i) the transfer of freight and train maintenance operations from the \nconfined and congested central station in Phnom Penh to a new and much larger area in Samrong, about 10 kilometers west, \nwhich is operationally ideal because it is at the confluence of the northern and southern railway lines; (ii) selective upgrading \nor  strengthening  of  existing  railway  infrastructure  to  conform  with  the  operational  requirements  for  the proposed  multimodal \nrailway  traffic,  as  well  as  the  higher  axle  load  standards  that  are  gradually  being  implemented  in  Thailand;  and  (iii) \nestablishing  spur  lines  to  existing  and  proposed  new  terminal  facilities,  which  are  essential  to  integrate  existing  and  new \nterminals  effectively  with  the  proposed  railway-based,  multimodal  system.  The  concessionaire  will  undertake  further \nupgrading of the railway's infrastructure as justified based on future traffic and revenues. \n\nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot applicable. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  resettlement  plan  includes  compensation,  resettlement,  and  livelihood  restoration  for  households  affected  by  land \nacquisition and displacement to restore, if not improve, their incomes and living standards. Poverty throughout the modified \nproject area may give rise to human trafficking. An established network for human trafficking is known to exist in Poipet and \non  the  Thai  side  of  the  border.  Migrants  into  Poipet  come  primarily  from  Battambang,  Banteay,  Kampong  Tom,  Kandal, \nMeanchey, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap. Those who cannot find jobs become easy prey for the human traffickers. The social \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 5 \n\n36 \n \n\nassessment  indicates  that  the  community  in  the  Poipet  area  has  identified  drug  use  as  a  problem.  Thus,  the  project  will \ninclude an awareness program on human trafficking and HIV/AIDS across the project. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nBefore  the  start  of  the  inventory  of  affected  assets  and  the  socioeconomic  survey  in  each  of  the  four  villages  under  whose \npolitical jurisdiction a portion of the Samrong railway facility falls, meetings were held with commune and village officials, and \nresidents  on  and  around  the  estate.  These  meetings  were  used  to  explain  the  need  for  the  government  to  reacquire  the \nSamrong  railway  estate  and  the  project  resettlement  policy,  and  to  listen  to  the  stakeholders'  concerns.  In  addition,  the \nHIV/AIDS prevention program includes community participation during design and implementation. \n  \n2.

The  government  will  ensure  that  (i)  any  land  rights  granted  to  affected \nhouseholds will be issued in the names of both husband and wife, and (ii) women railway staff affected by restructuring are \nincluded  in  counseling  and  retraining  programs  for  securing  new  jobs.  With  regard  to  HIV/AIDS,  the  contractor,  through  an \napproved  service  provider,  will  carry  out  an  awareness  and  prevention  campaign  during  construction  for  both  workers  and \ncommunities. In terms of project monitoring, disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender will be developed for monitoring \nsocial benefits, HIV/AIDS, economic opportunities, livelihood, and resettlement activities. \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nLabor \n\n Employment \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nImpacts on land and non-\nland assets within the 98.6 \nhectares Samrong estate \n\nAs all roads to be maintained \nor improved under the \nproject already exist, no \nnegative impact is expected \non indigenous peoples. \n\nProject-related employment \nduring construction and \nmaintenance  \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n Full Plan \n Short Plan \n Resettlement Framework \n No Action \n Plan \n Other Action \n Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework  \n\n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action  \n No Action \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nA resettlement plan has \nbeen prepared.  \n\nNone  \n\nIn the construction \ncampsites, labor standards \nwill be maintained and \nbasic facilities provided for \nthe workers.

Under  the  agreement,  Toll  Holdings  will  assume \nresponsibility for operation, maintenance, and development of the existing rail network, most of \nthe  permanent  and  moveable  assets,  and  670  staff  members  of  the  Royal  Railways  of \nCambodia (RRC). The concession process is in a transitional period with closing expected to be \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2010. \n\nA  contractor  is  rehabilitating  railway  infrastructure  concurrently  with  the  transfer  of \n2. \nresponsibilities  to  Toll  Holdings.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  government,  and \nbilateral development agencies are funding the rehabilitation works. A consultant is advising the \ngovernment on the contractor\u2019s works. Under the concession agreement, Toll Holdings became \na \u201cco-client\u201d of the government. \n\n3. \nThe  concession  management  committee  (CMC)  is  the  government\u2019s  entity  responsible \nfor  managing  the  concession  agreement.  The  CMC  is  an  ad  hoc  committee,  and  is  not \ninstitutionally  an  appropriate  entity  to  manage  the  concession  agreement  over  the  long  term. \nThe government has advised that it is planning to form a railway department within the Ministry \nof Public Works and Transport (MPWT).

OUTCOME MONITORING AND PROCUREMENT REVIEW \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction  \n\nConsulting services are required to provide outcome monitoring and procurement review \n1. \nfor the project. The purpose of the outcome monitoring is to assist the railway department of the \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  implementing  long-term  output  monitoring  as \nrequired  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  governments  of  Australia  and \nCambodia.  The  activity  will  take  an  integrated  approach  and  build  on  the  project-level \nmonitoring taking place through work of MPWT, the contractor, and the supervision consultant. \nThe  outcome  monitoring  will  include  an  overview  of  (i)  economic  and  transport  benefits \nmonitoring  as  outlined  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework;  (ii)  social  benefits  by  focusing \non  outcomes  related  to  the  effective  implementation  and  monitoring  of  resettlement  and \ncompensation  plans,  HIV/AIDS,  and  issues  related  to  gender  and  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iii) \ninstitutional  benefits  focusing  on  better  railway  organizational  systems.  The  purpose  of  the \nprocurement  review  is  to  provide  independent  review  and  advice  on  the  procurement  process \nfor works financed under the supplementary financing, especially procurement using negotiated \nvariation orders to two existing civil works contracts. An independent procurement specialist will \nbe  engaged  for  this.  The  employer  for  all  civil  works  contracts  is  MPWT.  The  existing  project \nsupervision  consultant1 is  appointed  by  the  government  to  act  as  the  engineer  on  the  existing \ncivil works contracts. The engineer will be responsible for the preparation of the variation orders, \nnegotiations  with  the  civil  works  contractor,  and  preparation  of  a  contract  variation  report  for \neach  contract  for  submission  to  ADB  for  its  review  and  approval.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework for the technical assistance (TA) is in Table A10.2. \n\nB. \n\nTerms of Reference for Outcome Monitoring \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPurpose \n\n2. \nThe  outcome  monitoring  services  will  require  8  person-months  of  international \nconsultants  and  16  person-months  of  national  consultants  over  2  years.  After  that,  outcome \nmonitoring will become integrated into government systems. Two international consultants and \na  national  consultant  will  provide  the  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure and simplified technical proposals.  \n\n2. \n\nScope of Work \n\n3. \nfollowing:  \n\n(i) \n\nThe  tasks  to  be  undertaken  by  the  outcome  monitoring  consultants  would  include  the \n\nreview  project-level  monitoring  already  under  way, \nincluding  (a)  project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  baselines  for  economic  and  transport \nindicators  developed  by  the  supervision  consultant,  (b)  monitoring  systems  and \nactivities  undertaken  as  part  of  resettlement  activities,  and  (c)  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework; \nconsult  with  ADB,  the  Government  of  Australia,  and  MPWT  about  the \ndevelopment  of  a  long-term  overarching  outcome  monitoring,  key  indicators, \npriorities, and expected outputs; \nprepare  an  overall  integrated  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  to  include \nkey indicators, baselines, methodology, data collection, strategies for integrating \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n1 Nippon Koei in association with JARTS (Japan), contract signed 11 January 2008. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n  \n\n52 \n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\ntasks, \n\ngender-disaggregated  data  where  appropriate,  as  well  as  key \nresponsibilities, and time frames; \nwork  collaboratively  and  coordinate  with  stakeholders  in  undertaking  outcome \nmonitoring,  including  integration  with  project  monitoring,  to  ensure  integration \nwith outcome monitoring; \nwork  collaboratively  to  ensure,  where  possible,  that  the  information  is  sourced \nfrom  government  systems  and  ongoing  project  activities  to  avoid  establishing \nduplicate systems or collection processes; \nprovide  training  and  support  to  the  railway  department  and  MPWT  on \nestablishing  and  operating  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  and  develop  a \nplan for transition to outcome monitoring in the railway department within 2 years; \nand  \nprepare  an  annual  outcome  monitoring  report  that  reviews  progress  towards \nproject  benefits  (intended  and  unintended)  and  outcomes,  and  submit  to  ADB, \nthe Government of Australia, and MPWT, and provide monitoring and evaluation \nsupport to semiannual supervision missions. \n\n4. \nThe international consultant will have primary responsibility for developing, establishing, \nand  managing  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems,  and  training  and  reporting.
