The \nproject falls into environmental category B. The additional works to be \nimplemented  under  the  modified  project  do  not  introduce  new  or \nsignificantly  different  environmental  impacts,  since  they  are  largely \ncontained within or close to the areas already assessed in the original \nproject\u2019s initial environmental examination (IEE). The site for Samrong \nStation consists of paddy fields and grassland with sparsely populated \nareas  nearby.  Other  components  involve  rehabilitation  of  existing \nsidings and construction of short new sidings (about 500\u2013800 meters in \nlength) linking to two dry ports about 50 meters from the existing main \nline.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  has \ncompleted an IEE of the additional works. \n   \nSocial Safeguards  The original project was formulated to minimize potential risks relating \nAssessment  to  involuntary  resettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  for  the  original \nproject is being updated, following the completion of detailed design. \nThe modified project will result in additional resettlement impacts at \nSamrong  because  of  the  construction  of  a  new  freight  facility.  An \nadditional  232  households  in  this  area  will  be  affected.  The  draft \nresettlement plan for Samrong has been finalized and approved by the \nGovernment of Cambodia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe principles for addressing social and gender issues are set out in \nthe  original  project.  The  additional  works  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary financing do not lead to new or different issues. The \nmitigation  measures  adopted  for  the  original  project  will  also  be \nimplemented for the supplementary financing. \n   \n ", "ii   \nSupplementary  The  original  project  is rehabilitating  and  restructuring  the  railway  in \nFinancing  Cambodia. In addition to this, the supplementary financing will be used \nDescription  to (i) establish a new freight and rolling stock maintenance facility at \nSamrong, 10 kilometers west of Phnom Penh, with sufficient space to \nmeet  future  multimodal  transport  requirements;  (ii) upgrade  or \nstrengthen parts of the main line to enable early initiation of integrated \nmultimodal services; and (iii) establish additional sidings to terminals to \nfacilitate multimodal connectivity. The combination of the original project \nand the supplementary financing will be referred to as the modified \nproject. The key activities for implementing the new facility at Samrong \ninclude design of the facility; procurement of contracts; preparation, \napproval, and implementation of the resettlement plan for the area; and \nimplementation of works. Strengthening and upgrading of track does \nnot require additional design or resettlement, activities consist primarily \nof  the  installation  of  heavier  rails  and  new  sleepers.  Installation  of \nadditional  sidings  to  terminals  requires  additional  design  and  minor \nresettlement. The outcome would be a selectively upgraded railway in \nCambodia exceeding the rehabilitation envisaged in the original project, \nenabling  early  takeoff  of  an  integrated,  railway-based,  multimodal \ntransport system. \n   \nTechnical  Technical assistance (TA) for Outcome Monitoring and Procurement \nAssistance  Review will be provided to assist MPWT in developing long-term output \nmonitoring as required by ADB and the governments of Australia and \nCambodia. Outcome monitoring will take an integrated approach and \nbuild on the project-level monitoring taking place through the work of \nMPWT, the contractor, and the project consultant. The TA will also \nsupport the procurement of additional works for track upgrading, which \nwill  be  implemented  through  variations  of  the  existing  track \nrehabilitation contracts. \n   \nRationale  The private sector concessionaire selected for the railway in Cambodia \nis  a  large  international  logistics  firm  that  operates  worldwide.  The \nconcessionaire  has  proposed  a  business  plan  that  would  not  only \ndevelop railway traffic, but also integrate the railway into a seamless \nregional  multimodal  transport  system  with  the  railway  providing  the \nmedium-  and  long-distance  backbone  for  links  between  dedicated \nterminals in Cambodia and Thailand, and to destinations in southern \nViet  Nam.  This  plan  would  elevate  Cambodia  from  a  subregionally \nconnected local transport market into a subregional hub in the southern \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Achieving hub status could create \nsignificant additional long-term development opportunities in Cambodia \nin  areas  such  as  logistic  services  (warehousing,  packaging,  and \nforwarding)  and  manufacturing  (assembly  and  production  of \ncomponents). It would also generate substantial subregional benefits by \nenabling the streamlining and rationalization of supply lines, which are \nessential to achieving and maintaining international competitiveness. \n \nEstablishing integrated logistics services based on the railway would be \nan early realization of the commitment that GMS leaders made at the \n2008  summit  in  Vientiane  to  expand  the  GMS  economic  corridor ", "  iii\nnetwork through multimodal links. It would also enhance the original \nobjectives of the rehabilitation project by upgrading railway transport \nfrom a supplier of transport services to a supplier of complete logistics \nsolutions. This would improve transport efficiency and the integration of \nCambodia  into  the  southern  GMS.  In  the  medium  term,  this \ntransformation would strengthen trade and integration, and enhance the \nGMS countries' collective competitiveness and economic development \npotential. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  modified  project  will  be  increased  domestic  and \nregional trade movement on the railway system, thereby supporting \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  be \nachieved by developing the railway in Cambodia into a provider of \nlogistics services in Cambodia and neighboring GMS countries. The \noutcome of the modified project will be a railway that is sustainable and \nefficiently operated. \n   \nRevised Project  The modified project is estimated to cost $141.6 million, including taxes \nInvestment Plan   and duties of $14.9 million. Of the total, $73.0 million is estimated for \nthe original rehabilitation project and $68.6 million for the additional \ncomponents under the supplementary financing. \n \n  Revised Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nAdditional \nComponents \nunder Supple-\nOriginal  mentary  Modified \nItem    Project  Financing  Projecta \nA.

The  main  sources  of  project \nbenefits are (i) savings from the diversion of heavy freight and container \ntraffic from road transport to more economical rail transport; and (ii) \nmore traffic as a result of interconnecting Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet \nNam. The savings will reduce the costs of imported inputs such as \ncement and fuel, which will promote the creation of new jobs and other \nincome-generating opportunities in export industries in Cambodia. In \nthe medium term, economic integration among the GMS countries will \nbe enhanced, which will increase their competitiveness as a result of \nlower  transport  costs  and  better  opportunities  for  supply  chain \nmanagement. The modified project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is \nestimated at 20.8% and the financial internal rate of return is estimated \nat 9.2%, higher than the 2.9% real weighted average cost of capital. \n   ", "  v\nRisks and  The modified project is not expected to be subject to any significant \nAssumptions  technical, environmental, or social risks. The MPWT has performed \nsatisfactorily  in  implementing  internationally  financed  projects.  The \nmodified project has been formulated to reduce potential economic, \nfinancial,  and  social  risks.  The  financial  and  economic  risks  are \nassociated with the operation of the railway, which will depend on the \nfuture level of traffic, the costs of construction, and the efficiency of \nfuture railway operations. The economic risks are minimized by the \ninvolvement of a private railway operator that will realize the modified \nproject\u2019s benefits by providing railway services on a commercial basis. \nThe  social  risks  include  resettlement,  the  possible  spread  of  HIV \ninfection during construction, and the retrenchment of redundant railway \nstaff in connection with restructuring. Appropriate mitigation measures \nare included in the resettlement plan and the social safety protection \nprogram. \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Cambodia\u2019s  transport  sector  comprises  road,  railway,  and  inland  water  transport; \ninternational sea traffic through the seaport in Sihanoukville and the river port in Phnom Penh; \nand domestic and international air traffic centered on Cambodia\u2019s three international airports in \nPhnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville. Much of the country\u2019s transport infrastructure was \ndestroyed or substantially degraded during the war. Reestablishing the transport infrastructure \nand modernizing the provision of transport have been major goals of the government for the \npast 15 years. Its efforts have focused on (i) reconstructing the road network; (ii) modernizing \nand upgrading the international ports and airports; and (iii) privatizing and gradually modernizing \nthe provision of transport. As a result, rehabilitation of the core road network is substantially \ncomplete, and road rehabilitation efforts are being refocused on the secondary and tertiary road \nnetworks.  The  international  ports  and  airports  have  been  rehabilitated  and  substantially \nmodernized, and domestic and international inland water transport is developing. The railway is \nbeing rehabilitated and its operations privatized under a long-term concession, which means \nthat all modes of transport services will soon be provided entirely by the private sector.2 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the governments of France \nand Japan have provided a major portion of the external assistance to Cambodia's transport \nsector. ADB's assistance began in 1993 with the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project,3 \nwhich included rehabilitation of national highways, sections of the railway network, and the port \nof Sihanoukville. In 2000, ADB provided a loan for the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project,4 \nwhich rehabilitated sections of the national highway that were damaged by the flood, along with \ncritical sections of railway track and embankments, and most recently provided assistance for \nperiodic  maintenance  of  the  highway  network.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  loans  to \nrehabilitate roads and widen bridges and culverts, procure railway wagons, and maintain roads. \nThe  Government  of  France  has  provided  financing  for  new  bridges,  development  of  the \ninternational airports, and procurement of spare parts for locomotives. The Government of \nJapan has provided assistance for the construction of large bridges, upgrading of the ports in \nPhnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and rehabilitation of highways. Other recent bilateral assistance \n                                                 \n1  Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank. \n2  Before the concession, the railway was operated by Royal Railways of Cambodia (RRC), which is a state-owned \nenterprise under the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT).

Appendix 2 lists assistance by development \npartners and ADB. \n \n4.  Transport is more expensive in Cambodia than in its neighboring countries because of \n(i) significantly  higher  fuel  taxes,  which  are  a  major  source  of  government  revenues; \n(ii) transport infrastructure that has not been rehabilitated yet, especially the secondary and \ntertiary  roads  and  the  railway,  which  increases  operating  costs  and  constrains  access; \n(iii) remaining  inefficiencies  in  transport  provision,  especially  in  road  transport,  which  is \ncharacterized  by  many  small  operators  without  the  scale,  management  capabilities,  and \nresources required to develop modern transport concepts such as seamless multimodal traffic \nand full-service door-to-door transport; and (iv) remaining barriers to the free flow of traffic \nacross Cambodia's international borders. As a result, staple commodities that the poor rely on \nare  more  expensive  in  Cambodia  than  in  neighboring  countries,  and  the  international \ncompetitiveness of Cambodia\u2019s export industries\u2014primarily garments and tourism, which are \nthe main generators of new jobs and foreign currency\u2014is being eroded. These transport-related \nchallenges are major constraints on economic growth, diminish the scope for the economy to \ndiversify into new sectors such as agricultural processing and industrial assembly, and hinder \nCambodia's effective integration into the subregional economy. \n \n5.  At  subregional  level,  cross-border  railway  transport  has  been  garnering  increasing \nattention  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  since  2006,  especially  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Several new projects have been proposed to \ninterconnect these countries, and to connect the subregion to the rest of Southeast Asia and \npart of the People\u2019s Republic of China that is outside the GMS. This renewed focus on railways \nreflects three primary concerns of the governments of GMS countries:  \n(i)  Rapid export-driven economic growth has increased road traffic, outstripping the \nresources available for maintaining and adding capacity to the road network. This \nhas led to congestion and rising transport costs that potentially threaten the GMS \ncountries' international competitiveness and capacity for growth.  \n(ii)  Rising energy prices and growing concerns over global warming has placed \ngreater emphasis on energy efficiency, partly to retain competitiveness and partly \nto forestall possible future product emission standards in consumer countries that \ncould limit the allowable carbon footprint of imported goods. \n(iii)  Escalating road casualties, resettlement, and the permanent loss of land to road \ninfrastructure  make  the  comparatively  safer  and  space-frugal  railways  more \nattractive. \n \n6.  As  a  result  of  these  concerns,  a  new  strategic  vision  has  emerged  among  the \ngovernments of GMS countries, focusing on multimodal transport systems with the railway as a \nbackbone for long-distance and cross-border traffic. To act as backbone, the GMS railways \nwould have to be efficient and interconnected across borders, have adequate capacity, and be \nconnected to suitable intermodal terminals. Further, to be a multimodal traffic system attractive \nto private users, the GMS railways will need to be commercially oriented and capable of offering \nintegrated logistics services. The sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "3 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  The issues and opportunities facing the railway were first analyzed in an advisory TA \nproject,5 which  concluded  that  access  to  efficient  railway  transport  would  be  economically \nbeneficial for Cambodia, and (ii) the railway could become commercially viable if rehabilitated. \nTwo small-scale TA studies were subsequently conducted\u2014one to assess the likely future \ndemand for railway traffic (the transport study),6 and the other to examine the possibilities for \nestablishing commercially viable railway operations (the business opportunity study).7 These \nstudies confirmed sufficient future demand to make rehabilitation of the railway economically, \nfinancially,  and  commercially  viable  for  the  private  sector  once its infrastructure  had  been \nrehabilitated. In response, the government requested a loan from ADB for the rehabilitation of \nthe  railway.8 It  also  asked  for  advisory  TA  to  restructure  the  railway9 by  assisting  the \ngovernment with privatizing railway operations under a long-term concession agreement, and \nstrengthening the government's regulatory capacity to manage and monitor the rail sector and \nthe concession in the future. \n \n8.  The Cambodian railway consists of two lines: (i) the northern line, which was built in the \n1930s and connects Phnom Penh to Poipet on the border with Thailand, where it links with the \nrailway in Thailand; and (ii) the southern line, which was built in the late 1960s and connects \nPhnom  Penh  with  Cambodia\u2019s  main  seaport  in  Sihanoukville.  The  northern  line  is  386 \nkilometers (km) long, but the last 48 km to the border with Thailand were destroyed during the \nwar. The southern line is about 254 km from where it branches off the northern line about 9 km \nfrom  the  station  in  Phnom  Penh,  making  the  total  distance  between  Phnom  Penh  and \nSihanoukville 263 km. The railway is meter gauge,10 as are the railway networks in neighboring \ncountries. The original project is restoring the railway\u2019s infrastructure by rehabilitating its existing \ntrack and reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with Thailand. \n \n9.  The proposed supplementary financing will add components that will accelerate the \ntakeoff  of  a  rail-based,  integrated  multimodal  system  providing  medium-  to  long-distance \ndomestic and regional links between terminals that connect to road, sea, and river transport. \nThe railway is geographically suited for this because it (i) runs parallel to the country\u2019s busiest \nhighways (National Roads 3, 4, and 5), providing feeder access to and from railway terminals \nalong the railway lines; (ii) interconnects with the country's two main international connection \npoints at Sihanoukville port and the land border with Thailand at Poipet, from where it links \ndirectly to the main industrial and logistics centers around Bangkok, thus providing subregional \nand international connectivity; and (iii) connects to the river port in Phnom Penh and to National \nRoad 1, which enables integration of rail transport with the developing inland water transport \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

Meter gauge refers to \nrails spaced 1.0 meter apart. Other common gauges are standard gauge (about 1.4 meters spacing), which is used \nin the PRC, North and South America, and most of Europe and Australia; and broad gauge (about 1.5 meters) \nwhich is used in the Russian Federation, Central Asia, South Asia and parts of Europe. Trains constructed to \noperate on one gauge cannot operate on another gauge without modification. Meter gauge is the common railway \nstandard in Southeast Asia, which means that trains from various national railways can interoperate. \n ", "4 \nsector to service traffic to and from northeastern Cambodia and Viet Nam\u2019s Mekong Delta. This \nnetwork will facilitate bilateral trade between Cambodia and Thailand and between Cambodia \nand Viet Nam, and could form the basis for establishing an attractive shortcut for the shipment \nof time-sensitive goods between Thailand and Viet Nam once suitable integrated transport \nservices are developed. \n \n10.  The  selected  concessionaire  is  a  large  international  logistics  firm  that  operates \nworldwide.  The  concessionaire's  business  plan  aims  to  develop  railway  traffic,  as  well  as \nsupport the integration of the railway into a seamless subregional, multimodal transport system. \nThe concessionaire foresees the railway providing medium- and long-distance links between \nterminals in Cambodia and Thailand, and possibly to destinations in southern Viet Nam in the \nfuture. This would transform the railway in Cambodia from a national railway connected to \nThailand  into  a  subregional,  multimodal  transport  system  that  seamlessly  integrates  the \ncountries in the southern GMS. As a result, Cambodia would be elevated from a subregionally \nconnected local transport market to a subregional hub in the southern GMS. Achieving hub \nstatus could create significant additional long-term development prospects in Cambodia in areas \nsuch  as  logistic  services  (warehousing,  packaging,  and  forwarding)  and  manufacturing \n(assembly  and  production  of  components).  It  would  also  generate  substantial  subregional \nbenefits by enabling streamlining and rationalization of supply lines, which are essential to \nachieving  and  maintaining  international  competitiveness.  The  potential  is  illustrated  by  the \nimpact both locally and regionally of long-established transport hubs, such as Hong Kong, China \nand Singapore. \n \n11.  Establishing  integrated  logistics  services  based  on  the  railway  would  be  an  early \nrealization of the commitment that GMS leaders made at the 2008 summit in Vientiane to \nexpand the economic corridor network through multimodal links in the GMS. It would also \nenhance the objectives of the rehabilitation project by upgrading the railway from a supplier of \ntransport services to a supplier of complete logistics solutions, which would improve transport \nefficiency and the integration of Cambodia into the southern GMS. In the medium term, this \nwould  strengthen  trade  and  integration,  and  enhance  the  GMS  countries'  collective \ncompetitiveness and economic development potential. \n \nIII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n12.  The original project is described in the Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Administration of Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia \nfor the Greater Mekong Subregion: Rehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project (footnote \n8). \n \nA.  Project Rationale \n13.  Cambodia\u2019s road transport system is inefficient because of inadequate modal and route \ncompetition.  Improving  the  sector\u2019s  efficiency  requires  increasing  the  diversity  of  transport \noptions, which would give shippers and passengers alternatives to existing routes and modes of \ntransport. Rail can be a highly competitive option, because its cost structure differs substantially \nfrom transport by road and sea. The differences in cost structure would make it difficult to \nestablish  and  maintain  cross-modal  collusion  between  road  and  rail  transport  operators. \nGeographically, rail would also be an efficient competitor because the railway runs parallel to \nthe country\u2019s busiest highways\u2014National Roads 3, 4, and 5\u2014and serves two international \nconnection points\u2014one at the Sihanoukville port and another at Poipet on the border with \nThailand. The railway is also connected to the Mekong River via the river port in Phnom Penh. \nThese  links  would  enable  multimodal  integration  that  could  form  the  basis  for  efficient \ndistribution of bulk commodities to northeastern and northwestern Cambodia. The scope for \n ", "5 \nadditional railway traffic is substantial. The restructuring study\u2019s traffic forecast predicts that \ndemand for railway freight traffic on average will grow by about 7.0% per year, significantly more \nthan the expected economic growth of 5.5% per year over the loan repayment period. \n \n14.  The  railway  is  in  poor  physical  condition  because  of  war  damage  and  decades  of \nneglect. The last 48 km of track to the border with Thailand were destroyed during the war. \nRailway traffic is declining because of the poor condition of track and equipment, which renders \nthe railway increasingly unreliable and slow. Meanwhile, the road network has been improved \nsubstantially since 1995. Railway employees are underpaid, and professional skills and staffing \nlevels are deteriorating. As a result, the railway is operating at a deficit. Neither the railway nor \nthe government has the resources required to turn the railway around. Without the project, the \nrailway could cease to operate within a decade. \n \n15.  Rehabilitating  the  railway  would  substantially  improve  the  efficiency  and  cost-\neffectiveness of Cambodia\u2019s transport system by enabling efficient and safe haulage of heavy, \nbulky, and hazardous cargo, such as cement, containers, and fuel. The main benefits would be \n(i) lower cost of transport for heavy and bulky freight; (ii) less road maintenance because of the \ndecrease in heavy truck traffic; (iii) fewer road hazards because of the decrease in heavy traffic \nand the diversion of hazardous materials away from crowded roads that pass through numerous \ndensely populated towns and villages; and (iv) efficient access to import and export markets via \nthe Thai border in Poipet, the port in Sihanoukville, and the inland waterway system connecting \nPhnom Penh with Viet Nam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City and Mekong Delta ports. Realizing these \nbenefits requires rehabilitating the railway\u2019s infrastructure, reconstructing the destroyed track \nleading to Thailand, rehabilitating the line to Phnom Penh\u2019s river port, and restructuring railway \noperations and maintenance on a commercial basis. \n \n16.  The government gives high priority to rehabilitating and restructuring the railway as a \nway to improve Cambodia\u2019s international connectivity and competitiveness, and reduce public \nsector losses. Cambodia\u2019s railway is also a strategic element of the GMS transport sector \nstrategy\u2019s southern corridor, which connects Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The project \nwould also pave the way for the proposed construction of a new railway line between Phnom \nPenh and Ho Chi Minh City. This new line, together with the project line, would complete the \nSingapore\u2013Kunming railway link, which is a long-term development priority for the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n17.  The objective of the original project is supporting Cambodia\u2019s economic development \nand  strengthening  subregional  integration  by  enabling  cost-effective  and  efficient  railway \ntransport within Cambodia, and between Cambodia and Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. \nThe original project involves rehabilitating or reconstructing the railway and reestablishing the \nrailway connection with Thailand. A private firm will operate the rehabilitated railway under a 30-\nyear concession. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n18.  The original project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $73.0 million, including taxes \nand duties equivalent to $7.4 million. The cost estimate for the original project is in Table 1. \n \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Original Project Investment Plan \nAmounta \nItem    ($ million) \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1. Civil Works  52.9 \n  2.

The original project\u2019s financing plan is in Table 2. ADB has provided a loan equivalent to \n$42 million (57% of the total cost) from its Special Funds resources. Interest financing charges \nduring implementation are capitalized. The OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) \nhas provided a loan of $13 million (18%) to jointly finance the civil works component with ADB. \nADB administers the OFID loan. The Government of Malaysia has provided a grant in kind of \nreclaimed rails valued at the equivalent of $2.8 million (4%). The Government of Cambodia is \nfinancing the equivalent of $15.2 million (21%), comprising all costs for project administration, \ntaxes, clearance of unexploded ordinance, compensation of railway staff in connection with \nrestructuring, and resettlement and land acquisition. The ADB loan has a 32-year maturity, \nincluding an 8-year grace period. The annual interest rate is 1.0% during the grace period and \n1.5% over the remainder of the loan. The OFID loan is repayable over 20 years, including a 5-\nyear grace period, with a fixed interest rate of 1% per year and a 1% fixed service charge per \nyear. The borrower for both loans is the Kingdom of Cambodia. \nTable 2: Original Project Financing Plan \nTotal  Share of Total Project Costs \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  42.0  57 \nOFID (administered by ADB)  13.0  18 \nGovernment of Malaysia (grant in kind)  2.8  4 \nGovernment of Cambodia  15.2  21 \nTotal  73.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "7 \nD.  Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n20.  The TA attached to the original project is (i) advising the government on restructuring of \nthe railway, specifically for developing and negotiating a long-term concession agreement to \noperate the railway commercially; and (ii) strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport (MPWT) to manage the concession and provide regulatory oversight for \nthe railway subsector in future. The restructuring consultant was mobilized in January 2006, the \nconcessionaire was selected on 30 November 2007 after international competitive bidding, and \nthe concession agreement was signed in June 2009. \n \n21.  The original project is restoring rail traffic by supporting rehabilitation of Cambodia's rail \nnetwork. ADB approved the project loan on 13 December 2006; the supervision consultant was \nmobilized on 14 January 2008; and the works contractor, which was awarded both rehabilitation \ncontracts for the northern line to Thailand and southern line to Sihanoukville Port, was mobilized \non 1 March 2008. The works contracts include detailed design. Because of delays in negotiating \nthe concession agreement, works were postponed until the concessionaire was in place. The \nreasons  for  this  temporary  suspension  of  works  were  twofold:  (i) to  ensure  that  the \nconcessionaire's operational requirements were adequately reflected during implementation, \nand (ii) to limit the government's liabilities if the concession negotiations did not succeed. As a \nresult,  implementation  progress  was  delayed  by  about  12  months.  With  the  concession \nagreement signed on 12 June 2009, work is now proceeding. Resettlement plans have been \ncompleted for the northern and southern lines, and are ready for implementation. MPWT, the \nconcessionaire, and the contractor are finalizing a time-bound plan for implementation of works. \nDetailed design for the original project is nearing completion, supply contracts for sleepers and \nother materials have been signed, work teams have been mobilized, and heavy track-laying \nequipment has been shipped into Cambodia. Physical works are expected to start in November. \nAll loan covenants have been met satisfactorily thus far (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n22.  Two lessons have been drawn from implementing this public\u2013private partnership project: \n(i)  It is difficult to reconcile ADB's time-bound loan processing and implementation \nschedules with a parallel process of concession negotiations between a public \nand a private partner, which is not\u2014and cannot realistically be\u2014subjected to \ndeadlines. This could conceivably be resolved if a mechanism to stop ADB's \nprocessing  and  implementation  \"clock\"  was  introduced,  enabling  parallel \nnegotiations to catch up with ADB's schedule as needed. \n(ii)  ADB  needs  to  accept  that  additional  resources  are  required  to  extensively \nfacilitate concession negotiations through mediation and other intervention. This \nhas been instrumental in securing a successful outcome of this project\u2019s public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  negotiations,  but  has  required  substantial  staff  and \nmanagement resources beyond those required for processing and administering \na traditional public sector project. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Proposed Changes \n23.  The proposed supplementary financing would expand the scope of the original project to \nincrease its regional integration and national development impacts. The expanded scope will \ninclude upgrading the railway's infrastructure to facilitate early takeoff of an integrated, railway-\nbased, multimodal transport system in the southern GMS. The supplementary financing will \nprovide for the following: \n ", "8 \n(i)  Transfer  of  freight  and  train  maintenance  operations  from  the  confined  and \ncongested central station in Phnom Penh to a new and much larger area in \nSamrong, about 10 km west. This will be a major improvement because the new \nsite (a) is at the confluence of the northern and southern railway lines, which is \noperationally ideal and reduces the need for heavy railway traffic through densely \npopulated areas in central Phnom Penh; (b) has sufficient space to facilitate \nfuture development; and (c) is away from populated areas and the congested \ntraffic in central Phnom Penh, which already constrains the usage of and access \nto the current station.  \n(ii)  Selective upgrading or strengthening of railway infrastructure to conform with the \noperational  requirements  for  the  proposed  multimodal  railway  traffic  and  the \nhigher axle load standards that are gradually being implemented in Thailand.  \n(iii)  New spur lines to the existing and proposed new terminal facilities. These are \nessential to effectively integrate existing and new terminals with the proposed \nrailway-based, multimodal transport system. The concessionaire will undertake \nadditional upgrading of the railway's infrastructure as justified by future traffic and \nrevenues. \n \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n24.  The impact of the modified project (the original project with the proposed supplementary \nfinancing) will be increased domestic and regional trade movement on the railway, thereby \nsupporting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  be  achieved  by \ndeveloping the railway in Cambodia into a provider of logistics services in Cambodia and \nneighboring GMS countries. The outcome of the modified project will be a railway that is \nsustainable and efficiently operated. \n \n25.  The outputs of the modified project will be (i) the existing railway line is rehabilitated and \npartially  upgraded,  enabling  safe  operations  at  an  average  mainline  speed  of  at  least \n50 km/hour; (ii) the railway link to Thailand is reconstructed; (iii) rail links to the Sihanoukville \nport and the port in Phnom Penh are rehabilitated and extended; (iv) freight facilities in Samrong \nand Phnom Penh are constructed; (v) affected households living within the railway's right-of-way  \nand the Samrong facility are satisfactorily compensated and assisted; and (vi) the new railway \ndepartment (paras. 33\u201334) is staffed and operational. \n \n26.  Based  on  the  potential  economic  development  gains  from  the  accelerated \nimplementation of the business plan proposed by the concessionaire, the government has \nprioritized  the  financing  of  the  infrastructure  upgrade.  This  will,  in  turn,  jump-start  the \ndevelopment  of  an  integrated  logistics  system.  The  concessionaire  will  finance  additional \nupgrades of the railway's infrastructure as justified by future traffic and revenues. \n \n27.  The design and monitoring framework for the modified project builds on the design and \nmonitoring framework of the original project, and reflects the additional project benefits and \noutcomes of the modified project. For the supplementary financing, the framework identifies the \noutcomes related to the effective operation and maintenance of the railway under a 30-year \nconcession, and the institutional support needed to monitor the concession and to develop a \nfuture regulatory framework. In addition, the design and monitoring framework highlights the \nimportance of social impacts by focusing on outcomes related to the effective implementation \nand monitoring of resettlement and compensation plans, including issues related to gender and \nvulnerable  groups.  To  effectively  monitor  project  outcomes,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework  and  project  baselines  must  be  established;  indicators  refined,  including  gender \n ", "9 \ndisaggregation; and an efficient process for monitoring identified. The Government of Australia \nwill finance TA for this purpose, and to help ensure that project outcome monitoring becomes \nintegrated into the Railway Department's systems (para. 50). \n \nC.  Rationale \n28.  Reflecting  the  increasing  role  of  rail  in  regional  transport  integration,  the  proposed \nsupplementary financing will (i) accelerate the development of the railway in Cambodia into an \nintegrated, regional logistics services provider, effectively interconnecting Cambodia, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam; and (ii) transform Cambodia into a subregional transport hub. This will provide for \nearly realization of the commitment that GMS leaders made at the 2008 summit in Vientiane to \nexpand the corridor network through multimodal links in the GMS. It will also be an example of \nimplementing  ADB's  Strategy  2020,11 which  commits  ADB  to  pursuing  inclusive  growth, \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  regional  integration  by  leveraging  three  of  the \nstrategy's five drivers for change: (i) private sector development and private sector operations, \n(ii) good governance and capacity development, and (iii) partnerships with the private sector. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  financing  will  generate  significant  subregional  development \nbenefits in the southern GMS, and will create new economic development opportunities in \nCambodia. \n \n29.  The activities to be financed by the proposed supplementary financing are technically \nfeasible, institutionally sound, economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of \n20.7%, and financially sustainable with a financial internal rate of return of about 9.2%. The \nrequirements  for  supplementary  financing  of  incremental  activities  have  been  met:  (i) the \nproposed incremental activities are consistent with the current country partnership strategy and \nthe development objectives of the original project, and increase its impact, outcomes, and \ndevelopment effectiveness; and (ii) the original project has made satisfactory implementation \nprogress, including full compliance with all loan covenants due thus far (para. 21), and is likely \nto attain its development objectives. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  The supplementary financing follows the principles outlined in the summary poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  for  the  original  rehabilitation  project,  including  resettlement \nactivities, HIV prevention, and project-related gender issues. The modified project will result in \nadditional resettlement impacts at Samrong because of the construction of a new freight and \nmaintenance facility. An additional 232 affected households12 have been identified at this site, \nbringing  the  total  number  to  about  1,700.  This  impact  is  addressed  in  a  supplementary \nresettlement  plan  for  Samrong  (Appendix  4)  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  agreed \nresettlement plan for the original project. \n \n31.  Gender issues are integrated into the project primarily through the resettlement and HIV \nprograms. Specific strategies for integrating gender equality include representation by women \nand men from affected households in resettlement working groups and special measures in \nrelation to vulnerable groups. Gender sensitization training will also be undertaken, particularly \nin the context of resettlement, for pertinent MPWT staff and district resettlement committees, \ndistrict officials, and commune leaders. For HIV prevention activities, the civil works contracts \ncontain  provisions  that  the  contractor  must  comply  with.  These  apply  to  the  contractor\u2019s \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila.  \n12 This number covers 231 households and one company. \n ", "10 \nworkforce  and  to  the  communities  with  which  they  interact.  Specifically,  the  contractor  is \nrequired to put in place an HIV awareness program through an approved service provider to \nreduce the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, promote early diagnosis, and provide \nassistance to affected households. Under the proposed outcome monitoring TA (para. 50), \ngender-disaggregated monitoring indicators will be developed to monitor social benefits, HIV, \neconomic opportunities, livelihoods, and resettlement outcomes. An updated summary poverty \nreduction  and  social strategy  reflecting  the  supplementary  activities is  in  Appendix  5.  The \nupdated  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement.13 \n \n32.  The railway alignment is outside environmentally sensitive areas, such as national parks \nand other protected areas and their buffer zones. The original project falls into environmental \ncategory B, which remains valid for the modified project. MPWT has prepared a supplementary \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) identifying environmental impacts, mitigation measures, \nand monitoring activities for components that will receive supplementary financing. The IEE \ncovers affected areas in Samrong and sites where an additional spur line will be established. No \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  to  arise  from  project  implementation  as \nappropriate engineering and environmental management measures will be employed. MPWT, \nwith support from the construction supervision consultant, will ensure proper implementation of \nsuch  measures.  The  summary  IEE  for  the  supplementary  activities  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \nE.  Institutional Support and Capacity Building \n33.  The success of the project will depend on the success of both its parts: (i) the physical \nrehabilitation  of  the  railway\u2019s  infrastructure,  and  (ii) the  effective  implementation  of  the \nconcession through which the railway will be managed and operated for the next 30 years. TA \nprovided  to  MPWT  (footnote  9)  and  its  concession  management  committee  (CMC)  has \nsupported  implementation  of  the  concession.  This  support  will  continue  until  mid-2010. \nHowever,  the  CMC  will  continue  to  require  expert  assistance  in  developing  sustainable \ninstitutional capacity to manage the concession through the life of the contract, and also to \neventually become the railway sector regulator. The CMC will need additional advisory and \ncapacity development support for at least 2\u20133 more years, until a substantial portion of the \nrailway has been rehabilitated and railway operations have settled into their long-term pattern. \nThe government has started this process by issuing a sub-decree that will (i) dissolve the Royal \nRailways of Cambodia, (ii) transfer the Royal Railways staff to MPWT, and (iii) establish the new \nrailway department within MPWT. The sub-decree became effective on 15 November 2009. \n \n34.  The scope of this additional support, outlined in Appendix 6, will include assisting MPWT \nwith (i) transforming the CMC from an ad hoc committee into a permanent railway department \nwithin  MPWT;  (ii) defining  the  management  and  staffing  structure  for  the  new department; \n(iii) monitoring the concession; (iv) preparing training programs and manuals for the railway \ndepartment\u2019s  operations,  including  safety  monitoring,  financial  management,  international \nrelations (for the rail links with Thailand and, in the longer term, Viet Nam), non-concession \nasset management, and infrastructure and rolling stock inspection. \n \nF.  Revised Cost Estimates \n35.  The supplementary financing investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $68.6 \nmillion, including taxes and duties of about $7.5 million. This will push the total cost for the \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement.

The Government of Australia will provide a \ngrant equivalent to $21.5 million (31.3%) on a joint cofinancing basis to be administered by \nADB. In addition, the Government of Australia will provide financing for the TA. The Government \nof Cambodia will finance the equivalent of $5.1 million (7.4%), comprising part of the civil works \ncosts  and  resettlement  and  land  acquisition.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a  32-year  maturity, \nincluding an 8-year grace period. The annual interest rate will be 1.0% during the grace period \nand 1.5% over the remainder of the loan. The borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. \n \n ", "12 \nTable 4: Revised Financing Plan \nSupplementary \nOriginal Project    Financing    Modified Project \nAmount  Share of  Amount  Share of  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  42.0  57.6  42.0  61.2  84.0  59.3 \nGovernment of Australiaa  0.0  0.0  21.5  31.3  21.5  15.2 \nOFID  13.0  17.8  0.0  0.0  13.0  9.2 \nGovernment of Malaysia \n2.8  3.8  0.0  0.0  2.8  2.0 \n(grant in kind) \nGovernment of Cambodia  15.2  20.8  5.1  7.4  20.3  14.3 \nTotal  73.0  100.0  68.6  100.0  141.6  100.0 \nOFID = OPEC Fund for International Development. \na  Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the Government of \nthe Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank, and administered by ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n37.  The  implementation  arrangements  set  out  in  the  original  project\u2019s  report  and \nrecommendation of the President will largely apply to the modified project. The MPWT will \nremain the executing agency for the project. The only change is that the government has invited \nthe concessionaire to join the project implementation team to ensure that works are prioritized \nand implemented in a way that maximizes the future usability of the railway infrastructure for the \nconcessionaire  and  minimizes  adverse  impact  on  rail  operations  during  construction.  This \ninvolvement includes participation in all construction and project planning meetings, and access \nto the implementing agency's project data and reports. \n2.  Implementation Period \n38.  The original project was scheduled to be implemented over 3 years, with completion in \nDecember 2009. However, because negotiation of the concession agreement took longer than \nexpected, the implementation schedule will be extended by 3.5 years with completion in March \n2013.  The extension  takes  into  account  the impact  of  the  1-year  delay  in  negotiating  the \nconcession agreement and allows sufficient time for implementing the additional works under \nthe proposed supplementary financing. The revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n3.  Procurement \n39.  Works similar to those included in the scope of the original contracts, such as structures, \ntrack strengthening, and additional sidings, which typically are within areas covered by the \noriginal contracts, will be implemented through variations to those contracts. These works are \nestimated  to  cost  about  $30  million.  The  variations  will  be  prepared  and  formalized  in \naccordance with the provisions of the civil works conditions of contract. MPWT, assisted by the \nexisting project consultant, will manage the process, which will be reviewed before finalization \nby a procurement specialist provided through TA (para. 52). ADB\u2019s approval of the contract \nvariations,  based  on  the  procurement  specialist\u2019s  review,  will  be  required  before  their \nfinalization. \n ", "13 \n40.  Works  of  a  different  type  to  those  included  in  the  original  contracts\u2014principally \ndevelopment of the Samrong facility\u2014will be implemented through two new contracts. These \nworks include the earthworks platform, buildings, facilities and equipment, road works, and track \nwork within the Samrong site. The estimated cost is about $20 million. The contracts will be \nseparate from, but interfaced with, the existing contracts managed by MPWT and supervised by \nthe project consultant. There will also be a supply contract for the provision of rail and sleepers \nfor the Samrong facility, and for replacement of sections on the northern line where detailed site \ninspections have found the original rail to be unusable. All new contracts will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding. \n41.  All  new  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Details  of  the  new  contracts  are  in \nAppendix 9. \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  The works under the proposed supplementary financing will require an additional 105 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  an  additional  210  person-months  of \nnational consultant inputs from the supervision consultant. These inputs will be provided through \na variation to the existing project consultant\u2019s contract. The terms of reference for the project \nconsultant will be amended to include design, procurement, and supervision of the Samrong \nfacility works. \n43.  Consulting  services  will  also  be  required  for  the  institutional  support  and  capacity \nbuilding  of  MPWT  (para.  33).  These  services  will  extend  over  3  years  and  require  about \n60 person-months of international consultants and 20 person-months of national consultants. \nThese consultants will have expertise in restructuring government railway enterprises, human \nresource development, railway operations and safety, and private sector concession monitoring. \nAn outline of the scope of the services is in Appendix 10. The government will select the \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure with a quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20 and full technical proposals. \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MPWT.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB or the Government of Australia in connection with the project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MPWT and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. In \naddition,  to  promote  transparency  and  good  governance,  the  government  has  agreed  to \nestablish a website for procurement under the project. Access to this website will be made \navailable to the public. MPWT will publicly disclose on the website information on how proceeds \nfrom the ADB loan and the grant of the Government of Australia (administered by ADB) are \nbeing used by presenting detailed information on the procurement process, including the list of \nparticipating bidders, the name of the winning bidder, basic details of the bidding procedures \nadopted, the amount of the contract awarded,  the list of the goods and services procured, and \nintended and actual utilization of ADB loan and Government of Australia grant proceeds under \n ", "14 \neach contract in English and Khmer. This information will also be published on public notice \nboards at commune centers and other public buildings in the project area. A good governance \nframework  for  the  project  (Appendix  11)  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to be signed by the government.  \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n45.  All disbursements under the ADB loan and the grant from the Government of Australia, if \napproved, will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time). The Australian contribution would be disbursed from budgetary \nallocations in Australian financial years 2009 to 2012,14 with the bulk of the funding likely being \navailable  in  the  last  2  years  of  this  period.  Reflecting  this,  ADB\u2019s  project  documentation, \nincluding  the  loan  agreement,  has  been  structured  to  accommodate  variable  year-by-year \nfinancing  shares  for  the  Government  of  Australia  and  ADB.  The  financing  shares  will  be \nadjusted once a year, on 1 July, and be valid for all withdrawals for the following 12 months. The \nestimated annual disbursement percentages are in Appendix 7, Table A7.3. The Ministry of \nEconomy  and  Finance  (MEF)  will  establish  an  imprest  account  at  the  National  Bank  of \nCambodia  for  disbursement  of  ADB's  share  of  resettlement  costs.  MEF  will  delegate \nadministration  of  the  account  to  MPWT  by  means  of  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nDeposits to the imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures to be paid from the \nimprest account for the next 6 months of project implementation or 10% of the loan amount, \nwhichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon between the borrower and ADB. A statement of expenditure will be used to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances to the imprest account to ensure speedy \nproject implementation. The ceiling for statements of expenditure will be $100,000 per invoice. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The MPWT will maintain separate accounts for the project, including assets, and will \nhave such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor \nacceptable to ADB in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. Within 6 months \nof the end of each fiscal year, MPWT will submit certified copies of audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements and the auditor's reports, in English, to ADB. The audit of the financial \nstatements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control \nsystems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  and  (ii)  an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB\u2019s project management requirements. \n47.  MPWT  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation by submitting quarterly progress reports, the form and content of which will be \nagreed  with  ADB.  MPWT  will  monitor  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation schedule and will keep ADB informed of any significant deviations from the \nschedule. The quarterly report will include basic data on utilization of funds, achievement of \nimmediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation progress, land \nacquisition, resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion, MPWT will submit a project completion report to ADB that will provide a detailed \nevaluation of the project design, costs, performance by contractors and consultants, social and \neconomic impact, economic rate of return, and other details that ADB may request. \n                                                 \n14  The financial year of the Government of Australia ends on 30 June, e.g., financial year 2009 ends on 30 June \n2010. \n ", "15 \n8.  Project Review \n48.  ADB staff, with the participation of representatives from the governments of Cambodia \nand Australia, will undertake a semiannual review of the project to assess (i) the status of \nimplementation,  (ii)  the  performance  of  the  government  and  the  concessionaire,  (iii)  the \nperformance of consultants and contractors, (iii) the status of compliance with the covenants \nstipulated in the loan agreement, and (iv) the need for any changes in the project scope or \nschedule to achieve the project\u2019s impact and objectives. These reviews will be supported by \nconsultants  with  appropriate  expertise,  in  particular  for  the  project\u2019s  critical  and  sensitive \ninvoluntary resettlement activity. A midterm review will be undertaken in 2011. In addition to the \nissues covered during regular project reviews, the midterm review will assess the impacts of the \nproject, and the progress in developing the new railway department\u2019s capacity to manage the \nconcession and regulate the railway sector. \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n49.  TA for Outcome Monitoring and Procurement Review (Appendix 10) will be provided to \nMPWT for (i) outcome monitoring; and (ii) procurement review for the works to be added to the \nproject scope through variations to the existing contracts. This will be done through a single TA \nproject with two parts corresponding to these tasks. The estimated cost of the TA is $0.45 \nmillion. The Government of Australia will finance the TA from its proposed grant for the project. \nADB will administer the TA. Disbursement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.15 \nA.  Outcome Monitoring \n50.  TA  for  outcome  monitoring  will  be  provided  through  MPWT\u2019s  CMC  (or  subsequent \nrailway department), which will also undertake long-term output monitoring as required by ADB \nand the governments of Australia and Cambodia. These services will extend over 2 years, after \nwhich outcome monitoring will be integrated into MPWT\u2019s systems. Outcome monitoring will \ncover (i) an overview of economic and transport benefits monitoring as outlined in the design \nand monitoring framework; (ii) social benefits by focusing on outcomes related to the effective \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  resettlement  and  compensation  plans,  including  issues \nrelated to gender and vulnerable groups; and (iii) institutional benefits focusing on improved \nrailway organizational systems. Outcome monitoring will take an integrated approach and build \non the project-level monitoring taking place through work of MPWT, the contractor, and the \nproject consultant. \n51.  This part of the TA will require about 8 person-months of international consultants and \n16 person-months of national consultants. These consultants will have expertise in developing \nmonitoring and evaluation frameworks; managing monitoring and evaluation systems, including \ngender disaggregation, data collection, analysis and reporting on activities, and outcomes and \nimpacts;  and  experience  in  training  national  staff  in  the  management  of  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems. A consulting firm will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- \nand cost-based selection procedure with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and simplified technical \nproposals. \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "16 \nB.  Procurement Review \n52.  This  part  of  the  TA  will  assist  MPWT  and  ADB  with  ensuring  that  the  process  of \ndeveloping, negotiating, and agreeing on contract variations is carried out appropriately and \nproduces a reasonable result. A substantial portion of the additional works to be introduced will \nbe carried out under these variations to the existing contracts. The task will require about \n1 month of consulting services, provided by an individual international procurement specialist. \n \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n53.  The benefits and impacts of the modified project were assessed along with potential \nrisks associated with the assumptions made in the project design. The combined benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \nA.  Social \n54.  The principles for addressing social and gender issues set out in the original project \nwere developed as part of an overall integrated approach for addressing resettlement activities, \nHIV awareness and prevention and gender equality issues. The original socioeconomic survey \nindicated that the project is not expected to affect ethnic minority groups any differently than the \nmajority Khmers. Thus, ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) is not triggered. Gender \nequity issues are integrated across the project through resettlement, HIV activities, and project \nmonitoring. The modified project includes the following actions to address gender issues in \nresettlement: (i) a male representative and a female representative of the affected households \nin a commune will sit in the resettlement working group; and (ii) sensitization training on gender \nand on the project resettlement policy will be provided to MPWT personnel and the working \ngroup through the project consultant\u2019s resettlement specialist. With regard to HIV, the civil works \ncontractors are required to develop and implement an awareness and prevention campaign \nduring the construction period for both workers and communities. In terms of project monitoring, \nmonitoring indicators disaggregated by gender will be developed for monitoring social benefits, \nHIV, economic opportunities, livelihoods, and resettlement outcomes. \nB.  Resettlement \n55.  The original project was formulated to minimize potential risks related to involuntary \nresettlement. The agreed upon resettlement plan is being updated following the completion of \ndetailed design. The modified project will result in additional resettlement impacts at Samrong \nbecause of the construction of a new freight facility. The total land area is 98.6 hectares. An \nadditional 232 affected households have been identified. The draft resettlement plan has been \nfinalized. The government has held public consultation meetings; distributed public information \nbooklets  in  the  Khmer  language  to  all  affected  households;  and placed  copies  of  the \nresettlement plan, translated into Khmer language, in the affected commune offices. \nC.  Connection with Thailand \n56.  The prime ministers of Cambodia and Thailand agreed in 2007 to reestablish the cross-\nborder  railway  connection,  and  the  two  railways  undertook  technical  discussions  on \nimplementation  arrangements.  The  talks  were  halted  while  the  Cambodian  concession \nagreement was being negotiated in 2008 to enable proper involvement of the new railway \noperator. Following the signing of the concession agreement on 12 June 2009, the Cambodian \nminister of public works and transport intends to reopen this process. ADB is providing support \n ", "17 \nfor  these  discussions through  the  ongoing  TA  project  for  restructuring  of  the railway,  and \nthrough its resident missions in Cambodia and Thailand. \nD.  Financial \n57.  The financial analysis of the modified project indicates that it will have a financial internal \nrate of return of about 9.2%, well above the real weighted average cost of capital for the \nmodified project of about 2.9%. The revised financial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n58.  The  financial  management  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  was  assessed  during \npreparation  of  the  original  loan  and  remains  valid.  MPWT  has  a  long-standing  record  of \nsatisfactorily implementing ADB projects. The financial management capacity of the private \nconcessionaire was assessed during bidding for the concession agreement, where it was one of \nthe prequalification criteria, and showed the operator had more than adequate financial capacity \nto undertake the concession. This assessment also remains valid. \nE.  Economic \n59.  The main benefits in the original project are associated with savings from the diversion \nof heavy freight and container traffic from road transport to more economical rail transport. The \nmain benefit from the supplementary financing is from subregional traffic using the railway's \ncheaper and faster subregional links. The traffic forecast in the original project is based on \nprojected future economic growth in Cambodia. It assumes that the railway will capture a \nsignificant share of the traffic generated by three new cement plants that are being planned and \nconstructed, as well as future container traffic on the southern line to and from Sihanoukville. \nThe economic analysis of the modified project considers projected railway traffic in Cambodia \nand the additional transit traffic as a result of the concessionaire\u2019s business plan, as well as the \nimpact of additional railway infrastructure investments. The economic analysis of the modified \nproject  shows  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  will  be  about  20.8%.  The  revised \neconomic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nF.  Environmental \n60.  The railway alignment is outside environmentally sensitive areas, such as national parks \nand other protected areas and their buffer zones. The project falls into environmental category \nB. The additional works to be implemented under the modified project do not introduce new or \nsignificantly different environmental impacts, since they are largely contained within or close to \nthe areas already assessed under the original project\u2019s IEE. The site for the new Samrong \nfacility consists of paddy fields and grassland with sparsely populated areas nearby. Other \ncomponents involve the rehabilitation of existing sidings and construction of short new sidings \n(500\u2013800 meters) about 50 meters from the existing main line. MPWT has performed further \nenvironmental examination of the additional works and submitted the draft IEE report to ADB. \nADB has submitted comments on the draft IEE. \nVII.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n61.  In addition to the standard assurances, the government and the MPWT have given the \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", "18 \n1.  Environment and Social \n(i)  The  government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  under  the  project \nincorporate  provisions  to  ensure  that  contractors  (a) comply  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s environmental regulations, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), the \nenvironmental management plan for the project, and the IEE; (b) comply with all \napplicable  laws  and  regulations  of  Cambodia,  including  ratified  international \ntreaty  obligations;  (c) do  not  employ  child  labor  and  provide  safe  working \nconditions for male and female workers; (d) do not provide male and female \nworkers with different wages or benefits for work of equal value to the extent that \nit is applicable to contractors; and (e) carry out training programs and awareness \ncampaigns on HIV at campsites and in communities along the railway lines. The \nMPWT will monitor compliance through the project consultant. \n2.  Resettlement \n(i)  The government will ensure that Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) \nupdates the resettlement plan after detailed project design based on a detailed \nmeasurement survey of losses. The assignments of the independent monitoring \nagency and the project consultant\u2019s resettlement specialists already engaged for \nthe original project will be expanded to also include monitoring and supervision at \nSamrong.  The  update  will  be  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  affected \nhouseholds and will be disclosed to them through relevant commune offices. The \nupdated resettlement plan for any section of the railway will be submitted to ADB \nfor  review  and  approval  before  commencement  of  any  land  acquisition  and \nrelocation activities for that section. IRC will implement the approved, updated \nresettlement plans in accordance with the government\u2019s laws, regulations, and \nprocedures and ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). In the case of \ndiscrepancies between the government\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures and \nADB's policy, ADB's policy will prevail. \n(ii)  Civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of possession of the pertinent \nsection of railway until (a) the satisfactory completion of compensation payments \nand relocation to new sites for that particular section, (b) the agreed rehabilitation \nassistance  is  in  place,  and  (c)  the  particular  section  is  free  from  all \nencumbrances. \n(iii)  The government will ensure that if people in the remaining right-of-way beyond \nthe corridor of impact are resettled in the future, the resettlement will be carried \nout in accordance with the standards established for this project. \n(iv)  The  government  will  ensure  the  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement to meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement \nbudget estimates to satisfy resettlement requirements and objectives. \n3.  Anticorruption Policy and Good Governance \n(i)  The government will comply with, and will cause MPWT to comply with, ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date).  The  government \n(a) acknowledges ADB\u2019s right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project; \nand (b) agrees to cooperate fully with, and to cause the MPWT to cooperate fully \nwith, any such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including \nproviding access to all relevant accounts and records, as may be necessary for \nthe satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n(ii)  Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph, the government will \n(a) ensure that the MPWT conducts periodic inspections of contractors\u2019 activities \n ", "19 \nrelated  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (b) ensure  and  cause  the \nMPWT  to  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  or  financed  by  the \nGovernment of Australia and administered by ADB in connection with the project \ninclude provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the project. \n(iii)  In addition to these requirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency, \nthe government will set up a website to disclose information about procurements \nrelated  to  the  project.  For  each  contract,  the  website  will  include  a  list  of \nparticipating bidders, the name of the winning bidder, the basic details of the \nbidding procedures adopted, the amount of the contract awarded,  the list of \ngoods, works or services procured, and intended and actual utilization of ADB \nloan and Government of Australia grant proceeds. In addition to the web-based \ndisclosure,  the  public  shall  be  provided  with  detailed  information  about \nprocurement on public notice boards (for example, at commune council facilities) \nin the area where works are carried out for the project. \n4.  Gender  \n(i)  The  government  will  ensure  that  women,  in  particular,  those  who  belong  to \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  and  ethnic  minority  groups,  participate  to  an \nextent satisfactory to ADB in (a) public consultation meetings on resettlement \nplanning; (b) detailed measurement survey; (c) capacity development programs \nrelating  to  resettlement;  and  (d)  relocation,  compensation,  and  livelihood \nimprovement activities to be undertaken under the project. \n(ii)  The government will ensure that (a) any land rights granted to affected people \nwill be issued in the names of both husband and wife; (b) women railway staff \naffected by restructuring are included in counseling and retraining programs for \nsecuring  employment  opportunities;  and  (c) gender  sensitization  training  is \nundertaken as part of supervision consulting services, particularly in the context \nof resettlement, for pertinent MPWT staff and district resettlement committees, \ndistrict officials, and commune leaders. \n5.  Project Monitoring \n(i)  At the beginning of project implementation, the MPWT will establish baseline and \ntarget values for the indicators before the start of works. The indicators shall \ninclude,  at  a  minimum,  information  on  railway  passenger  and  freight  traffic; \neffective average train speed; container traffic; traffic accidents; railway, road, \nand sea transport costs; heavy traffic on the railway versus roads; and producer \nprices as a share of the value of exports. The indicators shall be measured at \nproject inception, project completion, and 3 years after project completion and \ncompared with baseline values. Support to help establish the monitoring and \nevaluation system will be provided as part of supervision consulting services, and \nthrough  technical  assistance.  The  main  sources  of  data  shall  include \n(a) secondary data from the borrower\u2019s sources, (b) traffic counts, (c) railway \nstatistics,  (d) shipper  and  passenger  surveys,  (e) traffic  accident  database, \n(f) producer and price surveys, and (g) trade and customs statistics. The MPWT \nshall submit a report to ADB summarizing the key findings of monitoring at \ninception, project completion, and 3 years after project completion. \n \n ", "20 \nB.  Conditions for Effectiveness \n62.  Approval of the grant from the Government of Australia is a condition for effectiveness of \nthe proposed ADB supplementary loan. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n63.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the  supplementary  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing \nRights  26,408,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion: Rehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard; and \n(ii)  in  the  event  that  the  Government  of  Australia  approves  grant  financing  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $21,500,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the \nGreater Mekong Subregion: Rehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project, \nthe administration by ADB of such grant. \n \n \n \nC.

Strategic Foci and Key Activities  \n1.  The Government of Cambodia's strategy for the railway subsector is defined according \nto three stages. The first stage encompasses restructuring and rehabilitation of the railway with \nsupport  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The  second,  medium-term  stage  is \nextending the railway to the border with Viet Nam to complete the Singapore Kunming Railway \nLink, which currently is in the feasibility study stage with support from the People's Republic of \nChina (PRC). The third, long term, stage is developing the railway network with new lines, \npossibly to Siem Reap, northeastern Cambodia and ultimately Laos. \nB.  Major Development Partners \n2.  The main development partners in the railway subsector are ADB and Australia. The \ngovernment of Australia is cofinancing the supplementary financing for rehabilitation of the \nrailway and is supporting its organizational restructuring. PRC is financing a feasibility study for \nthe proposed new line to Loch Ninh on the border with Viet Nam. Other development partners in \nthe railway subsector are OPEC Fund for International Development and Malaysia, which are \ncofinancing the original project for rehabilitation of the railway. France is cofinancing ADB's TA \nfor restructuring of the railway. Other development partners include Japan, Thailand, Viet Nam, \nPRC and the World Bank which currently are financing various investments and technical \nassistance in the transport sector (Table A2.1). \nTable A2.1: Major Development Partners  \nDevelopment  Amount \nSectors and Themes  Partner  Project  Duration  ($ million) \nTransport, and  Thailand  Road Rehabilitation  1992\u20131993  6.4 \ninformation and  ADB, OFID  Road Rehabilitationa  1993\u20131993  67.7 \ncommunication  Thailand  Road Reconstruction  2006\u20132008  \u2026 \ntechnology; regional  ADB, OFID  Road Rehabilitation  2006\u20132009  60.0 \ncooperation and  Japan  Bridge Construction  2007\u20132009  \u2026 \nintegration  ADB, OFID,  Railway Rehabilitation  2008\u20132013  73.0 \nMalaysia \nTransport, and  UNDP  Emergency Repair  1992\u20131993  0.4 \ninformation and  Australia  Bridge Reconstruction  1992\u20131993  9.0 \ncommunication  Sweden  Road Rehabilitation  1993\u20131997  5.0 \ntechnology; economic  US  Road Reconstruction  1994\u20131996  30.6 \ngrowth  Japan  Road Reconstruction  1994\u20131999  109.0 \nDenmark  Ferry Rehabilitation  1995\u20131999  2.5 \nADB, Japan  Airport Improvement  1997\u20132003  15.0 \nJapan  Bridge Construction  1998\u20132001  53.2 \nADB  Road Improvement  1999\u20132003  50.5 \nADB  Emergency Flood Repaira  2000\u20132002  65.0 \nADB  Road Rehabilitation  2000\u20132003  74.8 \nJapan  Read Improvement  2001\u20132002  10.4 \nJapan  Bridge Reconstruction  2001\u20132002  11.3 \nJapan  Road Improvement  2001\u20132003  15.4 \nJapan  Port Modernization  2001\u20132007  \u2026 \nADB, World Bank  Emergency Flood Repaira  2002\u20132003  14.0 \nJapan  Road Rehabilitation  2002\u20132003  5.0 \nJapan  Road Rehabilitation  2002\u20132003  10.0 \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nDevelopment  Amount \nSectors and Themes  Partner  Project  Duration  ($ million) \nThailand  Road Reconstruction  2002\u20132004  7.6 \nWorld Bank  Road Rehabilitation  2002\u20132004  45.0 \nWorld Bank  Road Rehabilitation  2002\u20132004  5.0 \nJapan  Road Improvement  2003\u20132005  31.2 \nADB, Australia,  Road Maintenance  2009\u20132013  57.0 \nOFID, World Bank \nADB, OFID, Korea  Road Rehabilitation  2010\u20132013  7.0 \n\u2026 = not available, ADB = Asian Development Bank, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development, UNDP = \nUnited Nations Development Programme, US = United States. \na  These projects included small railway components.

Background and Issues \n3.  For more than a decade, the Government of Cambodia has emphasized rehabilitating its \ncore transport infrastructure to restore national cohesion and create the foundation for economic \ngrowth. The three international airports (Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville), the two \nmain ports (Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville), and the primary highway network will soon be fully \nrehabilitated and have adequate capacity. However, the railway is run-down and needs to be \nrehabilitated and restructured to become an efficient alternative. Restructuring is under way and \nrehabilitation is expected to start in 2009. \n4.  Nevertheless, much remains to be done in the transport sector to support continued \neconomic and social development:  \n(i)  Most provincial and rural roads are seasonally impassable to motorized traffic \nand await rehabilitation.  \n(ii)  Inland water transport has progressed slowly, driven by the private sector, but \ninfrastructure  such  as  river  ports  needs  to  be  upgraded  and  modernized  to \neffectively support multimodal transport.  \n(iii)  Domestic airports require repair and an assured financial basis to provide safe \noperations.  \n(iv)  Traffic regulation and enforcement is weak or nonexistent, and lack a sound legal \nbasis, although a draft road law has been prepared with support from the World \nBank.  \n(v)  Infrastructure  development  is  mostly  development  partner  financed,  but \nshortages  of  funds  and  a  lack  of  efficient  and  transparent  mechanisms  for \nmaintenance planning, disbursement, and execution hinder its operation and \nmaintenance.  \n(vi)  Transport services are inefficient, partly because of poor infrastructure and partly \nbecause of market failure and rent-seeking. \n5.  The  constraints  to  infrastructure  development  are  (i) a  shortage  of  qualified  and \nexperienced professional staff that is only slowly abating, and (ii) growing but still inadequate \ngovernment  funding  for  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance.  The  private  sector  can \nbecome a larger source of financing and management capacity in certain infrastructure areas, \nnotably the railway, the sea and river ports, and new terminal facilities such as container depots. \nIn other areas, such as road infrastructure, private sector involvement is currently feasible only \non a few roads because traffic levels elsewhere are too low to support toll-financed investment \nand maintenance.1 \n6.  The  execution  of  safeguard  policies,  especially  resettlement,  compensation,  and \nrehabilitation of those adversely impacted, has improved significantly in recent years. However, \nthere is still room for further improvement, especially through the establishment of a firm legal \nbasis for resettlement, compensation, and rehabilitation, and of consistent implementation. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing technical assistance in this regard.2 \n                                                 \n1  The complex and interlinked issues of road maintenance funding, planning, disbursement, and execution are \ndiscussed  extensively  in  ADB.  2002.

Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework \nand Institutional Capacity. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \n7.  Past infrastructure projects employed international contractors and consultants, and had \nlittle development impact in terms of spurring the emergence of national contractors, consulting \nengineers, and other service providers. This is expected to change soon after the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport (MPWT) decided to introduce private road contractors for road \nmaintenance rather than relying exclusively on force account for nationally funded projects. The \nRoad Asset Management Project,3 which is jointly funded by ADB, the Government of Australia, \nInternational Development Agency, and OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), is \nthe test for this. \nB.  Government Strategy \n8.  Since 1994, the primary tools of the government's strategy have been to (i) focus road \ninvestments on rehabilitating national highways and selected provincial, rural, and urban roads; \n(ii) undertake comprehensive privatization of transport provision; (iii) relax restrictive regulations, \nsuch as most of those on importing motor vehicles and all of those on access by foreign airlines; \nand (iv) franchise the operation, maintenance, and development of National Road 4, the three \ninternational airports (Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville), and air traffic control to the \nprivate sector. The government's strategy has been successful in restoring a core transport \nsystem that connects the country\u2019s main centers, and has significantly contributed to integrating \nthe national economy with the regional and global economies. \n9.  The government has initiated a process of decentralization and reforms. For example, \nthe delivery of transport infrastructure services, which had been centrally managed by the \nMPWT, is now delegated to the provinces. The MPWT is shifting its focus away from direct \nmanagement  of  transport  infrastructure  toward  planning  and  oversight  of  the  sector.  The \nprocess is moving forward with significant support from ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. However, it is encumbered by shortages of the skills and \nresources  required  to  undertake  these  new  roles  both  in  the  provinces  and  centrally.  For \nexample, disbursements for road maintenance are now made directly to the provinces, which \nlack the ability to produce credible road maintenance plans and adequately justified budgets. As \na result, road maintenance is generally poor, even though uncommitted funds are available. \nWith MPWT's commitment to introducing private contractors, road maintenance management is \nagain becoming the responsibility of the ministry. \n10.  The MPWT is preparing a revised strategy for future development of the transport sector \nbased  on  the  Cambodia  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study,  financed  by  ADB.4 In  terms  of \ntransport  sector  development  and  operation,  the  draft  strategy  is  likely  to  emphasize  the \nfollowing objectives and goals: \n(i)  Support  sustained  economic  growth,  and  promote  external  trade  and \nforeign direct investment. Transport is an integral part of the production of \nnearly all goods and services. Good transport infrastructure and cost-effective \ntransport  is  a  precondition  for  Cambodia's  export  drive  and  for  successful \ndevelopment of its tourism potential. It is also a major factor in containing the \ncost of living and improving rural livelihoods. A more diverse supply of transport \nservices  and  better  transport  logistics  using  multimodal  transport chains  are \nneeded  to  improve  Cambodia's  international  competitiveness  and  its \nattractiveness to foreign investors. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

Cambodia Transport Sector Strategy Study. Manila \n ", "28    Appendix 3 \n \n(ii)  Support poverty reduction and integration of the country. By enabling new \nproductive  activities  in  areas  not  previously  open  to  economic  exchange, \ntransport  creates  the  foundation  for  more  inclusive  and  pro-poor  economic \ngrowth. Transport achieves this by providing cost-effective and reliable access to \neconomic  opportunities  and  social  services,  thereby  enabling  the  poor  to \nparticipate more fully in society. Accessible and dependable transport networks, \nespecially provincial roads, are needed to link the provinces and to integrate rural \nareas into the mainstream economy. \n(iii)  Streamline and focus sector institutions, and expand private involvement \nin infrastructure provision. The government emphasizes strengthening sector \ninstitutions, especially the creation of clear mandates for their activities, as the \nbasis  for  institutional  reform  and  strengthening.  Given  the  human  resources \nconstraints,  the  government  recognizes  that  reform  requires  flexibility  in \nimplementation  with  the  focus  on  efficiency,  transparency,  and\u2014whenever \nefficient\u2014reliance on the private sector. In the past, the government has shown a \nreadiness to involve foreign and domestic investors in financing, developing, and \nmanaging transport infrastructure. The government intends to pursue this avenue \nfurther, and also strongly supports the development of national contractors to \nundertake infrastructure construction and maintenance services. \n(iv)  Secure  the  sustainability  of  transport. Fuel taxation is a major source of \nrevenue for the government, and charging for the use of infrastructure has been \nintroduced in most subsectors. However, with a few exceptions, low traffic loads \nlimit the scope for charging full user costs. As the scope for direct government \nfunding is equally limited, meeting the funding requirements for infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  in  the  short-  to  medium-term  will  require \nsupplementary funding from the private sector and development partners. \n(v)  Improve  safety  and  enforcement. The government is aware of the rapidly \ngrowing social and economic costs of poor traffic safety and recognizes that \ninefficient  enforcement\u2014because  of  a  weak  legal  foundation,  inadequate \nresources, and corrupt practices\u2014is a root cause of the problem. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  29 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN FOR SAMRONG \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n1.  The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), the executing agency for the \nGreater Mekong Subregion: Rehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project, plans to develop \na property of the Royal Railway of Cambodia that straddles the communes of Kakab and \nSamrong, Dankao District, into a railway freight and cargo railway facility. The Government of \nCambodia acquired this property in the 1950s for the use of the Royal Railway of Cambodia. \nThe V-shaped estate is bounded on the south by the tracks of the southern railway line, on the \nnorth by the tracks of the northern railway line, and on the west by Street 120-K (traversing \nSamrong commune). MPWT is repossessing the land sandwiched between the northern line \nand  southern  line  railway  tracks  plus  an  easement  corridor  of  10  meters  (m)  around  the \ncenterline of the northern and southern tracks. The aggregate land area to be repossessed is \n103.6 hectares (ha), a little more than the 98.6 ha that the government has committed to the \nrailway concessionaire for the cargo and freight railway facility. In this appendix, the estate is \nreferred to as Samrong because the Samrong railway station is at the northern tip of the \nproperty.  The  Samrong  railway  estate  will  be  leveled  and  developed  with  the  needed \ninfrastructure and facilities as freight and rolling stock maintenance facility. \n2.  Resettlement plan surveys found that 231 households, totaling about 1,270 persons and \none private company will be affected by the development of the facility.1 The inventory of losses \nand the socioeconomic survey of affected households done in May 2009 estimated that of a \ntotal land area of about 103.6 ha, about 86.94 ha of the Samrong estate is occupied or in the \npossession of the 231 households and 1 company. About 79% (68.42 ha) of this land is used for \nfarming,  particularly  for  growing  rice  and  watermelon,  while  19%  (16.32  ha)  is  used  for \nresidences. The remaining 2% (2.20 ha) is used for commerce. In addition, 62 main structures \n(56 houses and 6 shops) in the estate will be condemned. \nB.  Project Resettlement Policy and Entitlements \n3.  The resettlement plan for the Samrong facility was prepared in accordance with the \nagreed October 2006 resettlement plan for the original project. The affected households will be \ncompensated and assisted depending on the type and severity of their losses, and their ability \nto rehabilitate themselves, taking into account the vulnerability of the affected households. \nTable A4.1: Entitlement Matrix \nNo. of Entitled \nType of Impacts  Households  Entitlements  Implementation Issues \nLoss of agricultural land  To be  Cash assistance of $0.50/m2 for loss of  Outside Samrong estate, \nuse within the railway  determined  land use for agricultural land in the  affected households will be \ncorridor of influencea  corridor of influence.   allowed to continue to \ncultivate in the residual right \nof way for agricultural \npurposes only. \nPermanent loss of  175b  Cash compensation at $2.75 per m2.

Vulnerability and Gender Issues \n4.  Since some of the people who claim possession of plots of land in the estate do not \nreside  in  the  project  site,  the  survey  was  able  to  interview  only  169  heads  of  affected \nhouseholds, of which 120 were men and 49 were women. Of the 120 affected households \nheaded by males, 68 live in the project site and 52 reside elsewhere. Similarly, of the 49 \naffected households headed by women, 32 live in the project site and 17 reside elsewhere. \nDuring the inventory of losses survey, 51 affected households were identified as vulnerable. Of \nthese, 49 affected households are headed by women (including 2 of the sharecroppers and a \nfarming resident); 5 affected households are headed by a physically disabled person; 2 affected \nhouseholds have a monthly income below the poverty line; and 32 affected households are \nheaded by the elderly. Additional measures are incorporated in the resettlement plan to help \nensure that these affected households, which are considered particularly vulnerable, are not \nfurther disadvantaged and benefit equally from the project. Monitoring indicators for this purpose \nhave been incorporated in the resettlement plan. \nD.  Participation and Grievance Redress \n5.  The participation of the public, especially the affected households, and consultations on \nthe project and resettlement will be pursued as enunciated in the 2006 approved resettlement \nplan. The survey team before and after the inventory of losses survey met with local residents \nand affected households to discuss (i) initially the proposed project, schedule, and objectives \nand  nature  of  the  survey  team\u2019s  activities;  and  (ii)  in  general  terms  project  impacts  and \nentitlements following the completion of the inventory of losses. These activities will continue \nduring the updating and implementation of the resettlement plan, consistent with the project\u2019s \nparticipatory approach. The project\u2019s grievance mechanism has been designed to ensure that \nthe concerns and complaints of the affected households are readily addressed in the villages in \na timely and satisfactory manner. The affected households will be made fully aware of their \nrights  through  verbal  and  written  means  during  resettlement  planning,  updating,  and \nimplementation. \n ", "  Appendix 4  33 \nE.  Relocation and Rehabilitation Strategy \n6.  Affected  households  losing  dwelling  units,  including  those  that  have  established \nresidence in the Samrong railway station, will not be compensated for the land on which their \nhouses  are  built.  However,  they  will  have  the  option  to  (i)  self-relocate  and  receive  cash \nassistance of $10,000 each; or (ii) receive a 300 m2 plot each in a relocation site that will be \ndeveloped by the government in Dankao district, free of charge and with basic amenities, such \nas a latrine for each plot, road and drainage networks, electricity, and communal water wells. \nThe affected households may not sell or use as collateral the plots in the relocation site for 5 \nconsecutive years, and land title for these plots will be given to the affected households after 5 \nyears of occupation. The schedule of delivery of entitlements and relocation, and the start of \ncivil works, will also be discussed and agreed upon with the affected households during the \ndisclosure meeting consultations. The affected households must be given sufficient lead time to \nfind a place to relocate and rebuild their homes and shops, including finding a replacement for \ntheir lost productive assets, before displacement. \n7.  All severely affected households will take part in the needs assessment that will be \nconducted by project authorities during the preparation of the income-restoration program. The \nbudget for the income-restoration program for the affected households in Samrong will come \nfrom the budget of the resettlement plan for the original rehabilitation project. \nF.  Monitoring, Resettlement Plan Budget, and Implementation Schedule \n8.  The  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  (IRC),  in  close \ncollaboration  with  MPWT,  will  continue  to  serve  as  the  project\u2019s  internal  resettlement \nimplementing and monitoring agency. The IRC is responsible for submitting to MPWT and ADB \nproject progress reports that include updates on the progress of resettlement. The external \nmonitoring agency engaged by the IRC under the original project will include the Samrong \nfacility in its scope of work. The total cost of resettlement for Samrong is estimated at $4.1 \nmillion, which includes compensation and other entitlements to be provided to eligible affected \nhouseholds, operational and administrative expenses, and contingencies. MPWT and IRC will \nensure the timely availability of funds for resettlement, including unforeseen costs exceeding \nresettlement budget estimates to satisfy the project\u2019s resettlement objectives. \n9.  The  IRC  will  update  the  resettlement  plan  following  completion  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement survey. The updated resettlement plan will be submitted to ADB for review and \napproval before it is implemented. MPWT will not allow construction activities in the Samrong \nestate  to  start  until  the  affected  households  have  been  relocated  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plan. \nTable A4.2: Resettlement Schedule \nActivities  Schedule \nResettlement plan preparation  May\u2013June 2009 \nADB approval of draft resettlement plan   July 2009 \nResettlement plan updating   August 2009 \nSubmission and ADB approval of updated resettlement plan  September 2009 \nImplementation of the approved updated resettlement plan   October 2009\u2013March 2010 \nInternal monitoring (submission of quarterly progress reports) August 2009\u2013March 2010 \nExternal monitoring (intermittent)  September 2009\u2013March 2010 \nPost-resettlement evaluation  December 2010 \n ", "34    Appendix 4 \n \n \nG.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe government gives high priority to rehabilitating and restructuring the railway as a way to (i) improve Cambodia\u2019s \ninternational connectivity and competitiveness, and (ii) reduce losses in the public sector. Cambodia\u2019s railway is also a \nstrategic element of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) transport sector strategy\u2019s southern corridor, which connects \nCambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The project would also pave the way for the proposed construction of a new railway line \nbetween Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam. This new line, together with the project line, would complete the \nSingapore\u2013Kunming railway link, which is a long-term development priority for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nAbout one-third of Cambodia's population of about 13 million lives in poverty. Much of the country\u2019s infrastructure was \ndestroyed during decades of civil war and conflict, and its socioeconomic indicators are low. Poverty is overwhelmingly rural: \n40%\u201345% of people in rural areas are poor, compared with 10%\u201315% in Phnom Penh. The incidence of poverty has declined \nonly modestly in recent years for a number of reasons, including a shortage of sources of growth and exclusion of the poor \nfrom the mainstream economy. \n  \nImproving Cambodia\u2019s basic infrastructure is critical for the country\u2019s economic development, and Cambodia has started \nrehabilitating infrastructure with support from its development partners. The government-owned railway is in poor physical \ncondition because of war damage and decades of insufficient maintenance and investment. Rail traffic is declining because of \nthe poor condition of the tracks. As a result, the railway is generating operational deficits. The purpose of the project is to \nrestore efficient rail traffic by rehabilitating the existing railway line, reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with Thailand by \nreplacing a section to the border that was destroyed, and restructuring the railway subsector. Rehabilitation of the railway will \nfoster efficient rail freight service. It is expected that the proposed project will facilitate economic growth by providing a cost-\neffective and efficient means of transporting goods, as an efficient transport system would increase trade and jobs. The \nproject will also facilitate subregional trade and economic growth in Cambodia and Thailand. \n  \n2. Design Features \n \nThe proposed supplementary financing would expand the scope of the original project to include an upgrading of the railway's \ninfrastructure to facilitate the early takeoff of an integrated, railway-based, multimodal transport system on a subregional scale \nin the southern GMS. The immediate works required are (i) the transfer of freight and train maintenance operations from the \nconfined and congested central station in Phnom Penh to a new and much larger area in Samrong, about 10 kilometers west, \nwhich is operationally ideal because it is at the confluence of the northern and southern railway lines; (ii) selective upgrading \nor strengthening of existing railway infrastructure to conform with the operational requirements for the proposed multimodal \nrailway traffic, as well as the higher axle load standards that are gradually being implemented in Thailand; and (iii) \nestablishing spur lines to existing and proposed new terminal facilities, which are essential to integrate existing and new \nterminals  effectively  with  the  proposed  railway-based,  multimodal  system.  The  concessionaire  will  undertake  further \nupgrading of the railway's infrastructure as justified based on future traffic and revenues. \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe resettlement plan includes compensation, resettlement, and livelihood restoration for households affected by land \nacquisition and displacement to restore, if not improve, their incomes and living standards. Poverty throughout the modified \nproject area may give rise to human trafficking. An established network for human trafficking is known to exist in Poipet and \non the Thai side of the border. Migrants into Poipet come primarily from Battambang, Banteay, Kampong Tom, Kandal, \nMeanchey, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap. Those who cannot find jobs become easy prey for the human traffickers. The social \n ", "36    Appendix 5 \n \nassessment indicates that the community in the Poipet area has identified drug use as a problem. Thus, the project will \ninclude an awareness program on human trafficking and HIV/AIDS across the project. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nBefore the start of the inventory of affected assets and the socioeconomic survey in each of the four villages under whose \npolitical jurisdiction a portion of the Samrong railway facility falls, meetings were held with commune and village officials, and \nresidents on and around the estate. These meetings were used to explain the need for the government to reacquire the \nSamrong railway estate and the project resettlement policy, and to listen to the stakeholders' concerns. In addition, the \nHIV/AIDS prevention program includes community participation during design and implementation. \n  \n2.

The government will ensure that (i) any land rights granted to affected \nhouseholds will be issued in the names of both husband and wife, and (ii) women railway staff affected by restructuring are \nincluded in counseling and retraining programs for securing new jobs. With regard to HIV/AIDS, the contractor, through an \napproved service provider, will carry out an awareness and prevention campaign during construction for both workers and \ncommunities. In terms of project monitoring, disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender will be developed for monitoring \nsocial benefits, HIV/AIDS, economic opportunities, livelihood, and resettlement activities. \nIII.

Background  \n \n1.  On 12 June 2009, the Government of Cambodia and Toll Holdings (Cambodia) signed a \n32-year  railway  concession  agreement.  Under  the  agreement,  Toll  Holdings  will  assume \nresponsibility for operation, maintenance, and development of the existing rail network, most of \nthe  permanent  and  moveable  assets,  and  670  staff  members  of  the  Royal  Railways  of \nCambodia (RRC). The concession process is in a transitional period with closing expected to be \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2010. \n2.  A  contractor  is  rehabilitating  railway  infrastructure  concurrently  with  the  transfer  of \nresponsibilities to Toll Holdings. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government, and \nbilateral development agencies are funding the rehabilitation works. A consultant is advising the \ngovernment on the contractor\u2019s works. Under the concession agreement, Toll Holdings became \na \u201cco-client\u201d of the government. \n3.  The concession management committee (CMC) is the government\u2019s entity responsible \nfor  managing  the  concession  agreement.  The  CMC  is  an  ad  hoc  committee,  and  is  not \ninstitutionally an appropriate entity to manage the concession agreement over the long term. \nThe government has advised that it is planning to form a railway department within the Ministry \nof Public Works and Transport (MPWT). Among other responsibilities, this department will take \nover the functions of the CMC. The key functions of this organization will be to \n(i)  perform  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the  CMC  as  set  out  in  the \nconcession agreement; \n(ii)  transfer former RRC staff to Toll Holdings and manage the residual staff of \n430 persons\u2014about  1,100  RRC  staff  are  to  be  transferred  to  the  railway \ndepartment, and 670 of these will be hired by Toll Holdings;  \n(iii)  manage and develop railway land and fixed infrastructure not required by Toll \nHoldings, and retained by the government; \n(iv)  manage the infrastructure rehabilitation works project;  \n(v)  manage the development of new railway lines and services, including passenger \nservices, in Cambodia;  \n(vi)  set standards for rail infrastructure, rail operations, and rail safety; and \n(vii)  eventually become the railway sector regulator. \n \n4.  Figure A6 shows the preliminary structure of the proposed railway department. \n ", "  Appendix 6  39 \nFigure A6: Indicative Organizational Structure for the Proposed Railway Department \n in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \nSource: Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \n \n \nB.  Objectives of the Capacity Development Program \n \n5.  The government received technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank \nduring the concessioning process, and this TA will continue through the transitional period. The \nTA is assisting MPWT and the CMC in the formation of the initial organizational structure of the \nrailway department, but it will end after the first quarter of 2010. The railway department will \ncontinue to require expert assistance with developing the capacity to manage the concession \nthrough its life, and also to eventually become the railway sector regulator. The need for support \nwill continue for at least an additional 2\u20133 years, until a substantial portion of the railway has \nbeen rehabilitated and Toll Holdings\u2019 operations have settled into their long-term pattern. \n6.  Broadly, the objectives of the consulting services are to  \n(i)  assist  in  transforming  the  CMC  from  an  ad  hoc  committee  into  a  railway \ndepartment within MPWT; \n(ii)  assist in developing the capacity within the railway department to carry out its \nfunctions, in particular developing the department\u2019s capacity to carry out the \nmonitoring functions defined in the concession agreement; \n(iii)  develop the scope and content of required training programs, and assist in the \nplacement  of  railway  department  staff  at  institutions  and  entities  and  in  the \nevaluation of the effectiveness of training; \n(iv)  prepare manuals for the department\u2019s operations, including safety monitoring, \ninternational relations (for the rail links with Thailand and, in the longer term, Viet \nNam), non-concession asset management, and infrastructure and rolling stock \ninspection;  \n ", "40    Appendix 6 \n \n(v)  assist in developing the framework for the development and regulation of the rail \nnetwork in Cambodia and in developing relationships with other countries in the \nGMS related to the rail sector; and  \n(vi)  undertake long-term benefit monitoring, in collaboration with the benefits and \noutcome monitoring consultant. \n  \nC.  Detailed Scope of Services (indicative tasks) \n \n7.  Consulting services will be required for about 3 years, comprising about 60 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultants  and  20  person-months  of  national  consultants.

Introduction  \n1.  Consulting services are required to provide outcome monitoring and procurement review \nfor the project. The purpose of the outcome monitoring is to assist the railway department of the \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) implementing long-term output monitoring as \nrequired  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  governments  of  Australia  and \nCambodia.  The  activity  will  take  an  integrated  approach  and  build  on  the  project-level \nmonitoring taking place through work of MPWT, the contractor, and the supervision consultant. \nThe  outcome  monitoring  will  include  an  overview  of  (i)  economic  and  transport  benefits \nmonitoring as outlined in the design and monitoring framework; (ii) social benefits by focusing \non  outcomes  related  to  the  effective  implementation  and  monitoring  of  resettlement  and \ncompensation plans, HIV/AIDS, and issues related to gender and vulnerable groups; and (iii) \ninstitutional benefits focusing on better railway organizational systems. The purpose of the \nprocurement review is to provide independent review and advice on the procurement process \nfor works financed under the supplementary financing, especially procurement using negotiated \nvariation orders to two existing civil works contracts. An independent procurement specialist will \nbe engaged for this. The employer for all civil works contracts is MPWT. The existing project \nsupervision consultant1 is appointed by the government to act as the engineer on the existing \ncivil works contracts. The engineer will be responsible for the preparation of the variation orders, \nnegotiations with the civil works contractor, and preparation of a contract variation report for \neach contract for submission to ADB for its review and approval. The design and monitoring \nframework for the technical assistance (TA) is in Table A10.2. \nB.  Terms of Reference for Outcome Monitoring \n  1.  Purpose \n2.  The  outcome  monitoring  services  will  require  8  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and 16 person-months of national consultants over 2 years. After that, outcome \nmonitoring will become integrated into government systems. Two international consultants and \na national consultant will provide the consulting services. The consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure and simplified technical proposals.  \n2.
