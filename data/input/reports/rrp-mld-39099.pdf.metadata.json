Local \ncommunities  and  beneficiaries  will  actively  participate  in  the \nand \nimplementation, \nselection, \nmaintenance (O&M) of all works carried out under the Project.  \n \nThe  tsunami  had  a  devastating  impact  on  the  Maldives.  Eighty-\nthree  people  are  confirmed  dead  and  another  twenty-five  are \nmissing,  feared  dead.  More  than  1,300  people  suffered  injuries. \nUnlike  other  countries  affected  by  the  tsunami,  the  Maldives \nexperienced a disaster of national proportions. Thirty-nine islands \nwere  significantly  damaged  and  nearly  a  third  of  the  Maldives\u2019 \n300,000  people  were  severely  affected.  About  7%  of \nthe \npopulation  of  the  Maldives  was  displaced.  Thousands  of  people \nhad  their  livelihoods  undermined  and  they  will  continue  to  suffer \nunless immediate mitigating measures are taken. Total damage is \nestimated  to  be  about  $470  million, close  to 62%  of  GDP.  About \n$298 million is direct damages, and the rest is indirect losses. The \ndirect  damages  amount  to  about  8%  of  the  replacement  cost  of \nthe entire national capital stock, estimated to be about $3.8 billion \nat  2004  prices.  The  tourism  sector  suffered  the  largest  direct \ndamages,  with  losses  of  around  $100  million,  followed  by  the \nhousing sector, with losses close to $65 million. \n \n\noperation \n\ndesign, \n\nand \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe  combined  impact  of  the  tsunami  will  reduce  GDP  growth  in \n2005  significantly  from  the  pre-tsunami  estimate  of  7.5%  to  1%. \nThe  impact  on  public  finances  is  likely  to  be  substantial.  The \nbudget  deficit  (including  grants)  is  expected  to  rise  from  a \nprojected  4%  of  GDP  to  around  10%  of  GDP;  excluding  grants, \nthe  deficit  would  amount  to  18%  of  GDP.  There  are  concerns \nabout  the  sustainability  of  the  deficit  and  how  it  will  be  financed. \nThe  external  balance  is  also  expected  to  worsen.  The  current \naccount deficit of the balance of payments is expected to worsen \nto  about  23%  of  GDP  in  2005,  compared  with  12%  in  2004.  It  is \nestimated  that  the  financing  gap  of  the  balance  of  payments  will \nbe $68 million in 2005. Significant external financing is needed, in \nthe form of grants and concessional loans to the government, as \nwell  as  private  funds,  to  finance  the  budget  and  the  widening \ncurrent account deficit of the balance of payments. In undertaking \nadditional  external  liability  for  post-tsunami  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction, the Government of Maldives (the Government) will \nneed to be particularly careful to avoid increasing external debt to \nuncomfortable  levels,  which  could  have  a  negative  impact  on \nfuture growth. External debt (public and private) could rise to 47% \nof GDP in 2005 (from about 42% in 2004). Hence, grants will be \nthe  preferred  mode  of  external  assistance  for  financing  post-\ntsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  the \nsustainability  of  economic  growth  by  minimizing  the  devastating \nimpact of the tsunami. To attain this, economic recovery needs to \nbe  accelerated  through  reconstruction  of  damaged  infrastructure \nand  restoration  of  means  of  livelihood,  especially  of  the  poor,  in \nthe affected islands.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  two  components  (i)  a  quick-disbursing \ncomponent, and (ii) a project component.  \n \nThe Quick-Disbursing Component will partially finance the high \nand  unexpected  Government  expenditures  on  tsunami-related \nthe \nrehabilitation,  and \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy,  the  quick-disbursing  component  of  the  proposed  Project \nwill be used only to finance imports identified as necessary for an \neffective  recovery  program.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed on a list of imports that can be financed under the quick-\ndisbursing Project facility.  \n \n\nIn  accordance  with \n\nreconstruction. \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nlevels,  or \n\nThe  Project  Component  will  rehabilitate  high-priority,  tsunami-\ndamaged  infrastructure  and  facilities  by  providing  civil  works, \nequipment and materials, working capital, and consulting services \nfor project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The \nproject  component  will  follow  a  sector  approach  to  selecting \nsubprojects,  based  on  agreed  criteria.  Following  consultations \nwith the Government and development partners, the sectors listed \nbelow  have  been  included  in  this  component.  The  rehabilitation \nand  reconstruction  work  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  facilities  to \npre-tsunami \nto  higher,  more  cost-effective  and \nenvironmentally-sustainable standards.  Where necessary, project \ndesigns  will  include  protection  measures  against  future  natural \ndisasters. \n \nA.  Water  Supply,  Sanitation  and  Solid  Waste  Management. \nThis includes (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure \ndamaged  by  the  tsunami  (including  sewage  systems,  networks \nand  outfalls),  (ii)  provision  of  water  and  sewage  treatment  and \ndisposal  facilities  for  displaced  populations  after  the  tsunami \nrendered  their  islands  uninhabitable,  and  (iii)  provision  of  solid \nwaste management systems and facilities. \n \nB.  Transport. This includes (i) rehabilitation and/or reinstatement \nof \naids, \ndestroyed  maritime \n(ii) procurement  of  emergency  inter-island  transport  capacity  for \nreconstruction  works,  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  damaged \njetties, \n(iv) repairs to sea walls and quay walls, (v) repairs to causeways, \n(vi)  dredging  of  harbor  basins  and  approach  channels,  and \n(vii) rehabilitation of Mal\u00e9 international airport. \n \nC.  Power.  This  includes  rehabilitation  of  the  damaged  power \nsupply  system  and  covers  supply  and \ninstallation  of  new \nincluding  cables  and \ngenerators  and  distribution  network, \ndistribution boxes.  Streetlights will also be installed, if necessary. \nIn bigger islands, with more than one generator, panel boards will \nbe  provided \nislands  where \npowerhouses are badly damaged, new ones will be constructed.  \n \nD.  Fisheries.  This  includes  providing  fish  processors  in  128 \nislands with processing equipment, working capital, and extension \nservices.    The  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  Agriculture, \nand Marine Resources (MFAMR) will also be strengthened.  \n \nE.  Agriculture.  This  includes  providing  affected  farmers  in  the \nperennial  and  field  crop  sectors  with  tools  and  equipment,  and \nworking capital to rehabilitate their farms.  \n \n\nto  synchronize  operations. \n\nnavigation \n\ndamaged \n\nor \n\nIn \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nGrant and Loan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $25.3  million  equivalent, \nincluding the quick-disbursing component, which will be entirely in \nforeign exchange.

In  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  the  loan  will \nhave  a  40-year,  term  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  an \ninterest rate of 1% per year, and repayment of principal at 2% per \nannum  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4%  per \nannum thereafter.  \n \nUntil 30 September 2007 \n \n31 March 2007 \n\n100 \n81 \n19 \n \n100 \n86 \n14 \n\n16.4\n16.4\n0.0\n\n8.9\n5.4\n3.5\n\n\fExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nTreasury \n(MOFT).  A  National  Economic  Recovery  and \nReconstruction Program (NERRP) has been created to deal with \n(i)  national  economic  recovery  under  the  MOFT,  and  (ii)  housing \nand  infrastructure  redevelopment  under  the  Ministry  of  Planning \nand National Development (MPND). \n \nThe  recently  created  NERRP  will  manage  implementation  of \ntsunami-related rehabilitation and reconstruction projects. Its tasks \ninclude: (i) planning and implementation of the reconstruction and \nrehabilitation  of  affected  islands;  (ii)  coordination  of  the  recovery \nof the national economy; and (iii) planning and implementation of \nlong-term  projects  within  the  national  development  framework. \nThe  NERRP  mainly  consists  of  staff  from  MOFT,  who  will  be \nhandling  the  economic  recovery,  and  from  MPND,  who  will  be \ndealing  with  infrastructure  reconstruction.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented by a centralized PMU to be created under NERRP, \nso  that  the  Government  does  not  need  to  form  a  new  and \nseparate  PMU  for  the  Project.  MOFT  will,  however,  appoint  a \ndedicated  project  manager \nthe \nProject\u2019s implementation.  The project manager will be supported \nby  five  units,  under  NERRP:  (i)  planning  and  programming,  (ii) \nprocurement,  (iii)  finance  and  accounting,  (iv)  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  (v)  technical  and  implementation.  The  project \nmanager  and  the  five  units  will  be  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  for  the  Project.  The  technical  ministries  and  agencies  will \nbe the implementing agencies (IAs).  They will assign staff to the \nPMU's technical and implementation unit, and will be responsible \nfor technical matters relating to their respective sectoral expertise, \nas follows: \n \n\nto  coordinate  and  oversee \n\n(i) \n\nMinistry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Environment and \nConstruction  (MEC)  in  the  water  supply,  sanitation  and \nsolid waste management sector; \n\n(ii)  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development  (MOAD),  and  Ministry  of \nTransport  and  Civil  Aviation  (MTCA)  in  the  transport \nsector; \n\n(iii)  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  Agriculture  and  Marine  Resources \n(MFAMR), in the agriculture and fisheries sectors; and \n(iv)  State Electricity Company Limited (STELCO) in the power \n\nsector. \n\n \nIn addition, MOAD will coordinate activities at the atolls level. \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nfinancial \n\nrelated  services \n\nIAs,  as  well  as \n\nincluding  preparing \n\nTo  ensure  coordination  among  sectors,  the  Government  will \nestablish  a  project  coordinating  committee  (PCC).  The  PCC  will \nbe  co-chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  Treasury  and  the \nMinister  of  Planning  and  National  Development,  or \ntheir \ndesignates, and will include high-level representatives from MPND \nand \nthe  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family \nDevelopment and Social Security, and the Department of External \nResources. The PCC will provide guidance to the PMU on policy \nthe  selection  of  high-priority \nmatters,  and  will  decide  on \nsubprojects  proposed  by  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible \nfor  (i)  consolidating  subproject  proposals  from  the  implementing \nagencies  to  be  submitted  for  approval  by  the  PCC;  (ii)  preparing \nbidding  documents  and  conducting  procurement  of  civil  works, \nequipment,  goods,  and \ninfrastructure \nreconstruction; (iii) recommending the release of funds for working \ncapital  to  the  affected  communities;  (iv)  disbursing  funds  and \nreports;  and \naccounting, \n(v) preparing and submitting progress reports to PCC and ADB.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s funds will be disbursed through subaccounts under \nthe Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund (TRRF), created by \nthe Government, to (i) ensure transparency and harmonization, (ii) \navoid  duplication  of  effort,  and  (iii)  reduce  administrative \noverheads.  The  TRRF  will \ninternational  accounting \nstandards,  and  will  have  a  financial  management  system  to \naccount and report for project resources and expenditures. \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  services  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in \nfor  Procurement.  \nthe  ADB  Guidelines \naccordance  with \nthe  contemplated \nProcurement  will  be  expedited \nto  meet \nimplementation  schedule.  ADB\u2019s  procedures \nfor  providing \nreconstruction  assistance  after  disasters  provide  for  flexibility,  so \nthat project activities can start promptly. Local procurement will be \nthe  preferred  mode  for  all  civil  works  because  of  the  relatively \nshort implementation period, the small size of contract packages, \nand  the  wide  geographic  spread  of  the  project  sites.  Community \nparticipation will be encouraged. The flexibility provided in  ADB\u2019s \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  will  be  used  where \napplicable. Prior review by ADB of invitations for bids and bidding \ndocuments  shall  be  required  for  procurement  under  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures.  For  international  shopping   and \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procurement,  post \nfacto  approval \nprocedures  will  be  followed.  However,  if  ADB  does  not  approve \nthe  award  or  terms  of  the  contract,  the  Government  will  not  use \ngrant funds to finance the contract. If grant funds have been used, \nthe Government will refund to ADB any such payments. \n\nfollow \n\n\f \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nvii\n\nfor  TRRF  and \n\nThe  procurement  of  goods,  related  services,  and  works  through \ninternational  shopping, \nlocal  competitive  bidding,  and  other \nprocurement  methods  shall  follow  the  government\u2019s  procedures \nand  bidding  documents  established \nfound \nacceptable to ADB. Initial scrutiny indicates that the government\u2019s \nexisting  procedures  and  bidding  documents  are  broadly  in  line \nwith ADB\u2019s requirements. \n \nGiven  the  tight  implementation  schedule  and  the  limited  capacity \nof  IAs,  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  assist  the  PMU  in \n(i) prioritization  of  subprojects;  (ii)  technical  survey  and  detailed \ndesign  of  subprojects;  (iii)  preparation  of  cost  estimates; \nin  accordance  with \n(iv) preparation  of  subproject  proposals \nselection  criteria  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  Government; \n(v) supervision  and  monitoring  of  works  to  ensure  quality  control \nand  transparency  among  contractors  and  communities  carrying \nout  smaller  works;  and  (vi)  oversight  of  works  in  each  sector  or \nsubsector  and  provision  of  detailed  accounting,  auditing,  and \nreporting  to  PCC  and  ADB.  The  Project  will  require  a  total  of  27 \nperson-months of international and 63 person-months of domestic \nconsultants. Consultants will be engaged by ADB, in consultation \nwith the Government, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB \nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. Since the Project will \nbe  completed  within  24  months,  ADB  has  agreed  with  the \nGovernment  that  direct  engagement  of  individual  consultants  be \nundertaken, as provided for under the guidelines.  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  ongoing  Government  efforts  in \neconomic recovery; public infrastructure and utilities rehabilitation; \nlivelihood  and  employment  generation;  and  promotion  of  social \ncohesion.  It  will  help  restore  access  to  public  infrastructure  and \nservices.  It  will  help  to  maintain  clean  living  conditions  through \ncommunity-based  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement programs. The Project will also help re-establish lost \nagricultural  and  fishing  incomes  through  livelihood  programs \ntargeted  at  workers  in  the  agricultural  and  fisheries  sectors, \nespecially   women   who   engage   in   home  gardening  and fish \nprocessing.  Interventions  proposed  within  each  sector  will  help \nrestore  the  livelihoods  of  many  tsunami-affected  and  internally \ndisplaced people.

The  Project  will  help  to \nrestore the confidence and self-dignity of people and communities \nadversely affected by the tsunami. \n \n\nincluding  women,  will  be  an \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nis \n\nto \n\nissues, \n\nthat,  despite \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  strong \nA  potential  risk \ncommitment, implementation could be hampered by slow approval \nprocedures  and  lack  of  adequate  capacity  in  the  IAs.  The \nGovernment  has  streamlined  the  approval  procedures  for  all \nprojects,  and  a  PCC  will  be  established  to  ensure  coordination \namong  sectors  during  implementation.  The  PCC  will  have  high-\nlevel  political  and  administrative  representation.  It  will  provide \nguidance \nthe  centralized  PMU  on  policy  matters,  and \nspecifically will decide on the selection of high-priority subprojects \nproposed  by  the  PMU.  The  selected  IAs  have  considerable \nexperience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects  and  are \nfamiliar with ADB procedures. Specialized consultancy inputs will \nprovide additional implementation assistance to the PMU and the \nIAs. \n \nGovernance-related \nincluding  corruption,  constitute \nanother risk. They are addressed by detailed subproject selection \ncriteria,  transparent  implementation  and  monitoring  mechanisms, \nand specific financial controls, including regular as well as random \naudits.  These  will  include  strict  construction  supervision  and \nadequate  consultant  support,  and  close  monitoring  by  ADB\u2019s \nExtended  Mission \n(EM)  and  Headquarters  staff.  Random \nprocurement  and  annual  performance  auditing  at  the  executing \nagency  (EA)  level  will  also  be  carried  out.  A  dedicated  project \nimplementation  of \nmanager  will  assist \nsubprojects.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  involve  community-\nbased  organizations  (CBOs),  island  development  committees \n(IDCs),  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  monitoring \nproject  implementation.  Consultants  and  the  PMU  will  determine \nspecific  monitoring \nfor  outputs  of  sectors  and \nsubprojects.  The  Government  will  establish  a  grievance \nmechanism  to  give  tsunami-affected  people  an  opportunity  to  be \nheard  and  to  submit  any  complaints  related  to  ADB\u2019s  proposed \nassistance.  For  this  purpose,      facilitation      units      will      be  \nestablished   to   assist individuals and communities   to   access  \ngoods  and  services \nthe  Project,  or  other \nfinanced  under \nassistance for tsunami-affected people. Such facilitation units will \nbe  established  in  collaboration  with  CBOs  and  NGOs.  The  PMU \nwill  also  publicly  disclose  information  on  project  procurement  on \nthe website for the Project. The website will provide information on \nfinancial  statements,  bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract \nawards for the Project. ADB\u2019s EM staff and consultants will help to \ncreate  the  website.  Checks  and  balances  will  be  maintained  by \nconsultants,  who,  in  addition  to  providing  specialized  inputs  into \nthe design of subprojects, will conduct random spot checks during \nthe Project implementation and provide capacity building inputs in \nsuch areas as monitoring and evaluation. \n \n\nin  selection  and \n\nindicators \n\n\f \n\nix\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nand  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Tsunami  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (the \nProject)  to  partially  reconstruct  damaged  infrastructure  and  restore  livelihoods  that  were \nseverely  affected  by  the  tsunami  that  struck  the  Indian  Ocean  on  26  December  2004.  The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nImpact of the Tsunami on the Maldives \n\n2. \nThe tsunami traveled at over 700 kilometers per hour and reached the Maldives at 09:20 \nin the morning of 26 December 2004. Tidal waves ranging from 4 to 14 feet were reported in all \nparts of the country. More than 1,300 people were injured, 83 people are confirmed dead and \nanother  25  are  missing,  feared  dead.  Unlike  other  countries  affected  by  the  tsunami,  the \nMaldives  experienced  a  disaster  of  national  proportions.  Thirty-nine  islands  were  significantly \ndamaged and nearly a third of the Maldives\u2019 300,000 people were severely affected. Fourteen \nislands  were  completely  destroyed  and  evacuated.  More  than  12,500  people  have  been \ndisplaced from their islands, and another 8,500 have been temporarily relocated within their own \nislands.  About  7%  of  the  population  of  the  Maldives  was  displaced.  The  force  of  the  waves \ncaused  widespread  devastation  of  shelter  and  infrastructure  in  the  atolls.  Flooding  wiped  out \nelectricity  on  many  islands,  simultaneously  destroying  communication  links.  Water  supply  was \ndisrupted in about 15% of islands and 18% had major damage to essential infrastructure, such \nas  the  jetties  and  harbors,  that  links  them  to  Mal\u00e9.  The  electricity  supply  in  many  affected \nislands  has  yet  to  be  restored.  The  impact  on  an  economy  dependent  largely  on  tourism, \nfisheries,  and  agriculture  has  been  significant.  The  livelihoods  of  thousands  have  been \nundermined and they will continue to suffer unless immediate mitigating measures are taken. \n\nB. \n\nThe Government's Immediate Response \n\n3. \nThe  Government  of  the  Maldives  (the  Government)  acted  quickly,  and  an  impressive \nrelief and rehabilitation operation was put in place with support from UN agencies, NGOs, and \nother development partners. The President of the Maldives declared a state of national disaster \nand  appeals  were  made  for  international  assistance.  A  National  Disaster  Management  Centre \n(NDMC)  was  established  to  expedite  and  facilitate  coordination  of  rescue  and  relief.  The \nMinistry of Defense (MOD) is coordinating the overall relief effort, while the Ministry of Finance \nand  Treasury  (MOFT)  is  coordinating  donor  assistance.  The  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nDevelopment (MPND) is coordinating data gathering and long-term responses.  \n\n \nCommunication  was  restored  on  11  atolls  within  24  hours  of  the  tsunami  and  relief \n4. \nsupplies  were  dispatched  from  27  December  2004.  Communities  mobilized  in  support  of  their \nneighbors and the private sector also contributed to the relief effort.  \n\n \nNeeds Assessment \n\nC. \n\n5. \nThe Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 28 December 2004 for \nemergency  assistance  for  relief,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  in  response  to  the  damage \ncaused by the tsunami. In consultation with the Government, ADB, the World Bank, and the UN \nformed a team to undertake a needs assessment. The assessment began on 5 January 2005, \nand  an  interim  report  was  presented  to  the  Government  on  17  January  2005.  The  report  was \n\n\f2 \n\nrevised  based  on  comments  received  from  the  Government  and  other  development  partners. \nThe  Government  endorsed  the  findings  of  the  report  on  15  February  2005  (the  full  needs \nassessment report is in Supplementary Appendix A and a summary is in Appendix 2).  \n \nD. \n\nEstimated Reconstruction Costs and Financing Requirements \n\n6. \nTotal  damages  are  estimated  to  be  about  $470  million,  close  to  62%  of  GDP.  About \n$298  million  is  direct  damages,  and  the  rest  is  indirect  losses.  The  cost  of  direct  damages \namount  to  about  8%  of  the  replacement  cost  of  the  entire  national  capital  stock,  estimated  at \naround $3.8 billion at 2004 prices. The tourism sector suffered the largest direct damages, with \nlosses  of  $100  million,  followed  by  the  housing  sector  with  losses  close  to  $65  million.  The \nlargest  indirect  losses  also  occurred  in  the  tourism  sector,  which  has  seen  a  sharp  drop  in \ntourist arrivals. \n\n7. \nReconstruction costs are higher than total losses for some sectors (e.g. housing).  This \nis  because  of  the  need  to  rebuild  to  higher  standards  to  reduce  vulnerability  and  because \ncurrent construction or environmental standards are higher than when the original facilities were \nbuilt. Some indirect losses cannot be recovered: production losses from fishing and agriculture, \nand  tourism  cancellations  cannot  be  restored.  There  are  both  short-term  and  long-term \nfinancing  needs.  The  short-term  needs  reflect  investments  needed  urgently  within  the  next  6 \nmonths; the long-term needs cover the period from 6 months to 3 years. The overall financing \nneeds for the next 3 years are expected to be $406 million; of this, $120 million will be needed \nwithin the next 6 months i.e. in first half of 2005 (Appendix 2, Table A2.1). \n\nE. \n\nMacroeconomic Impact \n\n8. \nThe  tsunami  has  severely  affected  key  economic  sectors,  including  tourism,  fisheries, \nagriculture,  and  essential  infrastructure,  including  water  supply,  sanitation  and  power.    The \nimpact  on  these  sectors  will  spill  over  into  other  sectors.  The  tsunami  will  decelerate  GDP \ngrowth  substantially.  Economic  growth  forecasts  for  2005  have  been  revised  downwards  from \nthe pre-tsunami estimate of 7.5% to 1%. The impact of the tsunami on public finances is likely to \nbe substantial. The budget deficit (including grants) is expected to rise from a projected 4% of \nGDP to around 10% of GDP. The budget deficit, excluding grants, will amount to 18% of GDP. \nThere are concerns about the sustainability of the deficit and how it will be financed. Given the \nlimited maneuvering space for the government as a result of deficit spending in the recent past, \na lack of finance could constrain reconstruction spending. The balance of payments is expected \nto  deteriorate  because  of  a  slowdown  in  the  tourism  industry  and  the  imports  needed  for \nreconstruction.  However,  increases  in  official  transfers  and  remittances  may  mitigate  this \nsomewhat.  Overall,  the  current  account  deficit  of  the  balance  of  payments  is  expected  to  rise \nsharply to about 23% of GDP from 12% in 2004. The financing gap of the balance of payments \nis estimated at $68 million in 2005 after adjusting for a substantial increase in expected external \nassistance. Additional external financing is needed, in the form of grants and concessional loans \nto  the  Government,  as  well  as  more  private  funds,  to  finance  the  budget  and  the  widening \ncurrent account deficit of the balance of payments. \n\n \n9. \nThe  terms  under  which  external  finance  is  available  will  determine  the  pace  of \nreconstruction.  It  needs  to  be  emphasized  that,  in  undertaking  post-tsunami  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction, the Government will need to be particularly careful not to run up its external debt \nto  uncomfortable  levels,  which  could  affect  future  growth  prospects.  It  is  anticipated  that  the \nprivate sector will increase foreign borrowing, in order to finance the liquidity of banks and the \nreconstruction  of  resorts.  This  could  raise  total  external  debt  sharply.  Hence,  to  the  extent \n\n\fpossible,  grants  will  be  the  preferred  mode  of  external  assistance  for  financing  post-tsunami \nrehabilitation and reconstruction (for the macroeconomic impact see Appendix 3). \n \nF. \n\nNational Recovery and Reconstruction Plan \n\n10. \nThe  Government  has  recently  prepared  a  National  Recovery  and  Reconstruction  Plan \n(NRRP).1 The NRRP outlines the projects and programs required to meet the immediate needs \nfor  housing  and  infrastructure,  reviving  livelihoods,  and  creating  the  conditions  for  sustained \neconomic recovery. The priorities and objectives for recovery and reconstruction are: (i) disaster \nrelief (to help survivors cope with the immediate aftermath of the disaster); (ii) macroeconomic \nrecovery and livelihood revival (to restore community livelihoods, revive key economic sectors, \nand maintain macroeconomic stability); (iii) community empowerment (to rebuild lives with local \nownership);  (iv)  environmental  protection  (to  protect  and  regenerate  vulnerable  marine \necosystems, strengthen disaster preparedness, and mitigation measures); and (v) restoration of \npublic services (so everyone has access to basic services). \n \nThe NRRP has identified provision of emergency shelter to the displaced population as \n11. \nthe most important priority. The economic recovery plan is  based on a  stable and sustainable \nmacroeconomic framework, and aims to revive the tourism and fisheries sectors in the shortest \npossible  time.  In  the  event  of  resettlement  because  of  the  tsunami,  the  NRRP  categorically \nstates that such resettlement will be demand-driven and voluntary. The NRRP also emphasizes \nthe  need  to  rebuild  infrastructure  in  the  104  most  affected  islands.  These  include  schools, \nhospitals, coastal structures, transportation and communication infrastructure, water supply and \nsewerage, solid waste disposal systems, and electricity. The NRRP also supports establishment \nof  stronger  disaster  mitigation  measures,  and  protection  of  the  environment.  It  proposes  an \ninvestment program of $375 million in 13 sectors. The document also contains a sector based \nResults  and  Resource  Framework.  Prioritization  of  projects  within  sectors  has  yet  to  be \ncompleted. \n \nG. \n\nTsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund \n\n12. \nThe Government has set up a Tsunami Relief  and Reconstruction Fund (TRRF) under \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT).  The  TRRF  has  been  established  to  manage \nexternal financial assistance received for the tsunami relief and reconstruction effort. The TRRF \nwill operate as a separate fund and will enable the Government to disburse funds transparently \nand to account for tsunami-related assistance. The Government\u2019s objectives in establishing the \nTRRF  are  to:  (i)  significantly  reduce  delays  in  making  funds  available  at  the  operational  level; \n(ii) enable timely disbursement of funds; (iii) replenish the account quickly to maintain program \nmomentum;  and  (iv)  increase  the  speed,  accuracy  and  transparency  of  reporting.  The \nGovernment  has  asked  external  funding  agencies  to  provide  as  much  of  their  funding  as \npossible through the TRRF to: (i) ensure transparency; (ii) eliminate duplication of efforts; and \n(iii) reduce administrative overheads. \n \n13. \nTotal  commitments  reported  by  the  Government  as  of  end  February  2005  are  around \n$61.6  million,  of  which  $25.7  million  has  been  received.  The  Government  anticipates  that  all \ntsunami-related reconstruction assistance will be managed under the TRRF. Total cash and in-\n\n                                                 \n1   Ministry  of  Planning  and  National  Development,  Government  of  Maldives.  March  2005.  National  Recovery  and \n\nReconstruction Plan. Mal\u00e9.   \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nkind receipts as of end February 2005 amount to about $68 million (about 62% in kind and 38% \nin cash).2 \n \n14. \nThe TRRF will expend funds for relief, recovery, and reconstruction work to address the \nobjectives set by the Government  and external funding agencies.3 A monitoring board chaired \nby the Auditor General of the Maldives, and consisting of representatives from the Government, \nthe private sector, and external funding agencies, will monitor and supervise utilization of funds. \nThe TRRF will be administered by the MOFT. The Government is committed to ensuring that a \nTRRF  accounting  system,  developed  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  is \nestablished as soon as possible.4 The Government has already taken steps to implement an off-\nthe-shelf  accounting  software  package,  and  has  developed  a  draft  TRRF  operations  manual \n(OM).  The  draft  OM  outlines \nthe  TRRF  management,  administrative  structure,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  and  provides  guidelines  for  TRRF\u2019s  financial  management \nfunctions.  These functions include: (i) activity and project evaluation, appraisal, and approval; \n(ii) flow of funds; (iii) accounting and financial reporting standards; and (iv) audit arrangements. \nTRRF procurement guidelines are also being prepared. Guidelines are based upon the existing \ngovernment  financial  and  procurement  regulations,  and  the  Government  is  in  the  process  of \nstrengthening financial and internal controls to ensure that the special needs of the TRRF are \naddressed.  The  World  Bank  and  ADB  have  reviewed  the  OM  and  their  recommendations  are \nbeing incorporated.  \n \nH. \n\nSocial, Poverty, Environment, and Livelihood Impact \n\n15. \nSocial Impact. The social fabric of the tsunami-hit islands has been seriously affected \nby the extensive physical damage, loss of life and livelihoods, and displacement of people. Most \naffected people lost savings kept in cash in the house. The affected communities are now more \nvulnerable  to  poverty.  Although  traumatized,  island  communities  have  demonstrated  a  strong \nsense of independence, resilience and cohesion in mobilizing themselves into groups to remove \nrubble,  initiate  small-scale  reconstruction  activities,  distribute  relief  supplies,  and  shelter  those \nmade homeless. In a country of many small islands, community organizations have traditionally \nplayed an important role in providing public and collective services. The capacity of communities \nto mobilize themselves will be an important asset for the reconstruction work ahead. Community \nmobilization and self-help will be a cornerstone and organizing principle for demand-driven local \nrecovery  programs.  The  planned  reconstruction  activities  will  be  made  socially  more  cohesive \nby  taking  into  account  the  special  needs  of  women,  whose  livelihoods  have  been  especially \naffected  by  the  tsunami.  Livelihood  recovery  interventions  need  to  support  women\u2019s  income \ngeneration. Post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction programs also offer an opportunity to \nenhance  the  capacities  of  government  departments  and  island  communities  in  planning  and \nimplementing the recovery effort.  \n\n                                                 \n2  Separate records are maintained for aid received in kind. The inventory of supplies received and supplies issued is \nperiodically updated. Physical and administrative controls are maintained by the National Security Service (NSS). \nThe NSS has been mandated to monitor and control the movement of in-kind aid by controlling warehousing and \ntransportation  arrangements.    Controls  in  place  include  intake  registries,  requisition  slips,  release  slips,  periodic \ninventory counts, and segregation of duties. \n\n3  Appendix 5 describes Government arrangements for the TRRF: its management structure; staffing; financing plan; \nfunds flow arrangements; accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements; and monitoring and evaluation \narrangements.  \n\n4  The Government has already initiated a number of steps to strengthen its accounting system including as a result \nof dialogue with ADB linked to Loan 1915 (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Strengthening  of  the  Public  Accounting \nSystem Project. Manila). This process will continue and will be further accelerated once implementation of the loan \nbegins.  \n\n\fDisplacement.  Some  people  have  moved  to  other  islands,  either  temporarily  or \n16. \npermanently. While most affected people will return to their original islands, some communities \nwill be resettled either out of choice (the community wants to move to a larger or safer island) or \nout  of  necessity  (the  home  island  has  been  completely  destroyed,  submerged,  or  made \nuninhabitable). The government has clearly stated that nobody will be forced to relocate against \ntheir wishes. \n\n17. \nPoverty.  The  tsunami  may  lead  to  an  increase  in  poverty  as  a  result  of  exacerbated \nregional  disparities,  magnified  gender  differences,  and  an  increase  in  migration  to  Mal\u00e9.  An \nestimated 70% of the population outside of Mal\u00e9 has an income equivalent to the poorest 20% \nin  Mal\u00e9.  Almost  52%  of  the  affected  population  is  female.  The  vulnerability  of  the  poor  has \nincreased  in  the  post-tsunami  period  because  of  (i)  the  unclean  environment  and  the \nconsequent risk of disease; (ii) the damaged maritime and air infrastructure, limiting safe travel; \n(iii) destruction of public utilities and discontinued power supply; and (iv) destroyed livelihoods in \nagriculture  and  fisheries.  Poor  and  disadvantaged  households,  especially  those  headed  by \nwomen,  are  particularly  affected  by  these  shocks  and  face  a  risk  of  becoming  further \nmarginalized. \n\n18. \nEnvironment. Even more than most island nations, the Maldives is highly dependent on \nthe  fragile  ecosystem  of  its  coral  reef  islands.  The  tsunami  has  generated  a  range  of \nenvironmental  problems  with  the  potential  to  harm  human  health.  It  caused  widespread \ndeposition  of  coral  sand,  vegetation,  municipal  waste  from  dump  sites,  health  care  waste, \nhuman  excreta  from  damaged  septic  tanks,  hazardous  substances  (oils,  asbestos,  batteries, \netc.)  and  demolition  waste  (concrete,  coral  fragments,  timber,  etc.)  from  destroyed  buildings \nacross the impacted islands. It resulted in saltwater intrusion into fresh water sources on almost \nall of the 1,200 islands, causing vegetation to go brown and die. It is likely that the coral reefs \naround some islands have been damaged by sedimentation and excessive amounts of debris. \nIn addition, the tsunami resulted in beach and soil erosion.  \n\n19. \nSafety  Nets,  Employment,  and  Livelihoods.  The  tsunami  has  created  a  new \nvulnerable group; people who lost their houses, other assets, and livelihoods. How quickly they \nrecover  depends  critically  on  the  amount,  speed,  and  efficiency  of  targeted  public  support  for \nemployment creation and livelihood restoration.  As a step in this direction, the Government has \nlaunched the Island Livelihood Revitalization and Development Program. This program provides \n(i)  in-kind  equipment  (e.g.  fishing  equipment,  fish-processing  equipment,  start-up  packages \ncontaining  seeds  and  tools  for  agriculture);  (ii)  small  and  short-term  cash  grants  for  working \ncapital; (iii) subsidized microcredit for agricultural and other producers; (iv) financing for repairs \nto  fishing  vessels;  and  (v)  procurement  of  new  cost-effective  fishing  vessels  to  replace  those \nthat  were  lost.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  recognizes  that  some  affected  households \nmay not be able to benefit from such livelihood assistance, and will need targeted interventions. \nIn  the  very  short  term,  the  main  need  is  to  provide  shelter  and  income  support  to  displaced \npeople and the Government has disbursed Rf30 million ($2.3 million) to the affected population \nunder an emergency cash transfer program.5 The program is continuing and it is estimated that \nan additional Rf20 million ($1.6 million) will be disbursed shortly. It is estimated this program will \nreach  63,000  people.6  The  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family  Development,  and  Social  Security  has \n\n                                                 \n5   Under  the  program,  Rf1,500  ($117)  per  family  member  is  disbursed  to  people  who  have  completely  lost  their \nhouses; Rf1,000 ($78) per person to people whose houses were damaged and need repairs; and Rf500 ($39) per \nfamily member to people whose houses were flooded and therefore lost their belongings. \n\n6  Multisectoral teams from Mal\u00e9, together  with island committees, identified the beneficiaries, registered them, and \ndisbursed the assistance as a one-time cash transfer. The government is aware that not all affected have yet been \nserved, and efforts are ongoing to cover all the affected. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nproposed a follow-up income support program for affected individuals not covered by livelihood \nrestoration programs, such as the elderly, and people with disabilities.7 Restoration of damaged \nhousing and other infrastructure, such as island offices and courts, will provide an  opportunity \nfor short-term employment.  \n\nI. \n\nNational Disaster Risk Management \n\n20. \nThe  recent  disaster  has  increased  Government  awareness  of  the  risk  exposure  of  the \nMaldives and the measures needed to manage that risk. The Government is preparing a risk-\nmanagement strategy to reduce the human and economic impact of future disasters. The three \npillars of risk management are risk information, risk mitigation, and risk transfer.  \n\nThe first pillar, risk information, aims to increase the understanding of risk, based on an \n21. \nassessment of vulnerability. The Government plans to participate in a regional warning system \nand  develop  a  national  communications  program  to  inform  island  representatives  and  local \ncommunities.  Preparedness  planning  would  be  put  in  place  for  first  response  and  emergency \nrelief and a broadband communications network is planned.  Updated information, based on a \ncomprehensive risk mapping, would be made available to the population.  \n\n22. \nThe  second  pillar,  risk  mitigation,  includes  structural  and  nonstructural  measures.  The \nnonstructural  measures  include  changes  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  system,  particularly  with \nregard to land use planning and the building code, so the reconstruction process can lead to a \nreduction in risk. Land use plans would incorporate risk mapping information to reflect different \nlevels  of  risks  in  the  zoning.  The  building  code  would  introduce  construction  requirements  to \nlimit the vulnerability of the built environment. Risk mitigation needs to be complemented by the \nidentification of shelters, and the construction, or adaptation, of multipurpose shelters. \n\n23. \nThe  third  pillar,  risk  transfer,  would  attempt  to  distribute  risk  among  the  Government, \nhouseholds,  and  insurance  companies.  Sectors  such  as  tourism,  fisheries,  and  banking,  in \nparticular, could benefit from insurance against risk. \n\nJ. \n\nResponse of Development Partners \n\n24. \nThe United Nations Office of Coordination and Humanitarian Assistance deployed a UN \nDisaster  Assessment  and  Coordination  team  to  the  Maldives  the  day  after  the  tsunami  hit,  to \nprovide technical assistance for disaster assessment and the management and coordination of \ndisaster  response.  UNDP  and  other  UN  agencies  rapidly  approved  and  released  more  than \n$400,000 of immediate emergency funds and other in-kind support. On 6 January 2005, the UN \nsystem launched an appeal for $65 million for the Maldives. Less than half the target has been \nmet, with the shelter and livelihood components of the appeal largely unfunded. \n\n \n25. \nThe  World  Bank  has  extended  emergency  post-tsunami  support  in  the  form  of  quick- \ndisbursing  emergency  assistance.  The  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  has \nprovided credit of $14 million, of which $2 million would be new money. The rest would come \nfrom loan cancellations and savings. The World Bank expects to provide 40% of its emergency \nsupport in the form of grants. It will support safety-net cash transfers, grants to small businesses \nto  restore  their  assets and  livelihoods,  education  sector  reconstruction, and  technical  skills  for \n                                                 \n7 This new proposed scheme would give Rf500 ($39) per month per person for a period of 10 months, confined to a \nselect target group of around 20,000 individuals, with total cost Rf10 million ($780,000). Free health care might also \nbe provided.  \n\n \n\n\fprogram  management.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  IDA  credit  will  be  channeled  through  the  TRRF.  A \nfurther  $12  million  in  IDA  assistance  is  expected  in  FY2006  from  IDA  XIV  resources.  The \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved $6.3 million in emergency assistance to help \nthe Government deal with the devastating effect of the tsunami.8 In addition, the Government of \nJapan  has  extended  a  $20  million  grant  for  post-tsunami  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  of \nwhich $10 million will be for housing, $5 million for livelihood support (agriculture, fisheries, and \nsmall businesses), and $5 million of which has yet to be allocated. The International Federation \nof  the  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies  has  committed  a  little  over  $10  million  to  build \n500  houses.  The  Croix-Rouge  Fran\u00e7aise  (French  Red  Cross)  has  committed  $10  million  for \nhousing. \n \nK. \n\nLessons in Disaster Management \n\n26. \nADB  has  not  provided  disaster  emergency  assistance  to  the  Maldives  before.  This  will \nbe only the second project developed under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy \n(May 2004);9 the first being the Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project in Bangladesh \nthat was approved in January 2005. Some general lessons can nevertheless be drawn based \non the experience of other developing member countries (DMCs), most notably of Bangladesh, \nwhere  ADB  has  provided  eight  postdisaster  loans.10  The  general  lessons  are  that  (i)  projects \nmust  be  prepared  as  quickly  as  possible;  (ii)  they  should  focus  on  restoring  facilities; \n(iii) rehabilitation  works,  to  the  extent  possible,  should  be  completed  within  2  years; \n(iv) implementation will place a heavy burden on executing agency staff and, therefore, strong \nconsulting  support  and  ADB  supervision  will  be  needed  during  implementation;  and  (v)  efforts \nshould be made to ensure that ADB\u2019s rapid response to disasters is matched by equally quick \naction by the Government.  \n\n \n27. \nOther  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  earlier  emergency  projects  are  that  (i)  beneficiary \nparticipation  is  important  and  should  be  increased  in  project  preparation  and  implementation, \nespecially  in  the  maintenance  of  facilities;  (ii)  environment  and  social  aspects  need  to  be \nconsidered during implementation, even though the need for a rapid response may not permit \ndetailed  treatment  before  approval;  (iii)  arrangements  for  disbursements,  including  retroactive \nfinancing and the use of imprest accounts, should give the executing agency quick and simple \naccess to funds; (iv) project objectives and scope need to be carefully defined; and (v) criteria \nfor  subproject  selection  should  permit  simple  prioritization  of  subprojects  and  short \nimplementation  periods.  In  addition,  anticorruption  measures  need  to  be  addressed  even  in \nemergency projects. These lessons have been considered and incorporated in the design of the \nproposed Project for Maldives. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n28. \nThe main objective of the Project is to contribute to the sustainability of economic growth \nby minimizing the devastating impact of the tsunami. To attain this objective, economic recovery \n\n                                                 \n8  IMF\u2019s emergency assistance will be repaid in eight quarterly installments over 3\u00bc to 5 years from the disbursement \n\ndate, with a subsidized charge of 0.5% per annum. \n\n9   ADB. 2004.

The  design  and  implementation  of \nsubprojects  will  involve  community  participation.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  public \ninfrastructure,  and  adopt  appropriate  design  standards  in  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid \nwaste management, power, and transport sectors. In addition, the Project will restore livelihoods \nin the fisheries and agriculture sectors. \n \n30. \nThe Project has been developed in close cooperation with the World Bank and the UN, \nboth of which are closely involved in the post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in \nthe  Maldives.11  The  choice  of  sectors  and  the  project  design  is  based  on  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of the joint needs assessment. Close coordination between the agencies and \nthe  Government  has  been  maintained  throughout  the  processing  of  the  Project.  ADB  and  the \nWorld  Bank  plan  to  field  an  extended  mission  (EM)  in  Mal\u00e9  to  improve  implementation  and \ncoordination with the Government and other development partners. \n \n31.  Members of the project team visited various affected islands, examined the damage, and \nheld discussions with affected people and local communities.12 The field visits were particularly \nuseful in determining the scope and form of the Project. The design of the Project draws upon \nADB\u2019s  significant  experience  in  delivering  emergency  assistance  in  DMCs  over  the  last  two \ndecades. The Project complements relief and other assistance provided by the Government, UN \nagencies, NGOs, bilateral development partners, and the World Bank.  \n\n \n32. \nThe Project is consistent with the Maldives\u2019 medium-term objectives as expressed in the \n6th National Development Plan, covering 2001-2005, and the long-term Vision 2020. It is also in \nline with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for the Maldives, which prioritizes improvements \nto  physical  and  social  infrastructure  to  support  pro-poor  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the \nouter islands and atolls. ADB\u2019s current and future assistance will focus on improvements to the \nwater  supply,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  domestic  maritime  transport,  outer  islands \nelectrification,  employment  skills  training,  and  SME  development.  In  the  post-tsunami  period, \nADB programs will continue to focus on promoting economic diversification and employment by \nproviding basic economic, public and social infrastructure in the atolls. The Project is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.13 \n  \nB. \n\nMain Features of the Proposed Project \n\nComposition of the Project. The proposed Project will combine a grant from the Asian \n\n33. \nTsunami Fund (ATF) and a loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.  \n \n34. \nGrant.  In  view  of  the  severe  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  tsunami,  and  the  large \nfinancing gap in the fiscal and external accounts of the Maldives, the Project will have a grant \ncomponent  of  $20  million  from  the  ATF  in  order  to  meet  immediate  and  medium-term \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  requirements.  The  grant  funds  from  the  ATF  will  not  finance \n\n                                                 \n11  Discussions  were  also  held  with  bilateral  donors,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID), \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  UK  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID),  and \nUS Agency for International Development (USAid), in Colombo in early March on the Project. \n\n12  Members  of  the  project  team  visited  Maafushi  Island,  South  Mal\u00e9  Atoll,  Guraidhoo  Island,  South  Mal\u00e9  Atoll  and \n\nKolhufushi and Naalaafushi in  Meemu Atoll. \n\n13  ADB. 2004.

When formulating the Project, the Government\u2019s capacity, the possibility for loan \nportfolio  restructuring,  and  the  potential  use  of  loan  savings  from  six  ongoing  loans  were \ncarefully assessed in line with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.  Based on this \nassessment,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  cancel  the  surplus  loan  proceeds  of  three \nprojects.14 The Government has formally recommended to ADB that the cancelled $1.8 million \nin  surplus  loan  funds  from  these  projects  be  reallocated  to  the  Project  and  it  is  proposed  that \nthis be done.  \n \nSize of the Project. The Project would thus total $21.8 million, and would consist of a \n\n36. \n$20 million grant and a $1.8 million loan from Special Funds Resources.  \n \n37. \nOther  ADB  Assistance.  In  addition,  ADB  will  separately  process  grant  assistance  of \n$1 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) in order to restore the livelihoods \nof  tsunami-affected  farmers  in  the  Maldives.  This  project  will  enable  farmers  in  the  26  worst \naffected agricultural communities to restart their livelihoods. ADB is also processing a $250,000 \nproject from its Poverty and Environment Program (PEP) on Saving the Tsunami-Affected Trees \nin the Maldives. An advisory technical assistance (TA) for $400,000 from the Poverty Reduction \nFund (PRF) on Promoting Sound Environmental Management in the Aftermath of the Tsunami \nDisaster is also being processed.   \n \nC. \n\nComponents of the Proposed Project \n\n38. \nQuick-Disbursing  Component.  The  Government  requested  that,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, a portion of the proposed Project be used for \nquick-disbursing assistance to partially finance the unusually high and unexpected expenditures \non  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  Since  the  World  Bank  is  also  providing  quick-disbursing \nassistance, it is proposed that ADB\u2019s Project extend $6.5 million in quick-disbursing assistance \n($4.7  million  of  grants  and  a  $1.8  million  loan  from  Special  Funds  resources).  In  accordance \nwith the requirement of ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the quick- disbursing \ncomponent will be used only to finance imports identified as necessary for an effective recovery \nprogram. The Government and ADB have agreed on a list of permissible imports for financing \nunder the quick-disbursing Project facility (Appendix 4). \n \nProject  Component.  The  project  component  will  be  $15.3  million  and  will  be  grant- \n39. \nfinanced.  It  will  be  used  to  rehabilitate  high-priority,  tsunami-damaged  infrastructure  and \nfacilities  by  providing  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  working  capital,  and  consulting \nservices for project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. During the rehabilitation \nphase,  appropriate  and  cost-effective  design  standards  will  be  adopted,  while  simultaneously \ntaking  into  account  that  project  designs  attempt  to  incorporate  disaster  resistant  parameters. \nThe  Project  will  follow  a  sector  approach  in  selecting  the  highest-priority  subprojects  during \nimplementation.  This  will  allow  a  quick  response  and  maximum  flexibility  in  both  geographic \ncoverage and selection of components, within an agreed framework and criteria. In consultation \nwith  the  Government,  and  taking  into  account  the  assistance  being  proposed  by  other \n                                                 \n14  (i)  ADB.  1998.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  for \nPost Secondary Development Education Project ($0.2 million); (ii) ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  for  Regional  Development  ($1.2  million);  and  (iii)  ADB. \n2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Director on a Proposed Loan for Employment \nSkills Training Project ($0.4 million). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ndevelopment partners, the project component will finance rehabilitation and reconstruction in the \nfollowing  sectors:  (i)  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management  ($4.0  million);  (ii) \ntransport ($2.9 million); (iii) power ($2.5 million); (iv) fisheries ($2.6 million); and (v) agriculture \n($2.5 million). Consulting services for project design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation \nwill be $0.8 million. \n \nD. \n\nSector Assistance and Outputs \n\ninfrastructure  and  services  urgently  need \n\n40.  Water  Supply,  Sanitation  and  Solid  Waste  Management.  The  water  supply  and \nsanitation  sector  was  seriously  affected  as  a  result  of  the  tsunami.  Water  supply  and  basic \nsanitation \nto  be  replaced,  rehabilitated,  or \nreconstructed. Introduction of solid waste management systems and restructuring of the sector \nare  needed  to  cope  with  the  damage  and  debris.  The  joint  needs  assessment  estimated  that \n$45.6 million would be needed to rehabilitate the sector. Damage includes loss of infrastructure \nfor  water  supply,  household  and  communal  rainwater  tanks;  damage  to  roof  water  harvesting \npiping  and  gutter  systems;  and  loss  of  pumps  and  sewerage  networks,  including  6,000  pour-\nflush latrines and septic tanks and an estimated 126 kilometers (km) of small-bore sewers and \n2.4 km of sea outfall.  \n \n41. \nThis  component  will  rehabilitate  and  provide  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  services  for  the  69  most  affected  communities.    Rehabilitation \nworks will be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami levels or to higher, cost-effective, and \nenvironmentally acceptable standards. In the short term, critical equipment will be procured for \n(i)  immediate  provision  of  safe  water  to  affected  areas  through  community  and  household \nrainwater tanks and rainwater harvesting equipment; (ii) provision of basic temporary sanitation \nfacilities and rehabilitation of existing sanitation infrastructure, including desludging systems and \nsludge  drying  beds;  (iii) provision  of  solid  waste  management  equipment  (including  communal \nbins, composters, compactors, cutters), and (iv) training for clearing and recovery of debris. In \nthe  medium  term,  (i)  environmental  infrastructure  (including  sewage  systems,  networks  and \noutfalls)  will  be  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed;  (ii)  water  and  sewage  treatment  and  disposal \nfacilities  for  displaced  populations  will  be  provided;  and  (iii) solid  waste  management  systems \nand facilities will be provided (Appendix 6).  \n \n42. \nTransport.  Based  on  figures  from  142  tsunami-affected  islands,  and  following \ndiscussions  with  relevant  ministries,  the  joint  needs  assessment  report  estimated  the  cost  of \nreconstruction for the transport sector to be $24.9 million. The report estimated that about one \nthird of navigation aids were damaged or destroyed and 36 jetties were damaged. About 4,200 \nmeters  (m)  of  quay  walls,  and  15,000  m  of  harbor/sea  walls  and  breakwaters  have  been \ndamaged or destroyed, and dredging will be required to remove about 370,000 m3 of silt from \nharbor basins and approach channels. Five causeways, which are very important for inter-island \nconnections, have been partly damaged. There has been some damage to Mal\u00e9\u2019s commercial \nharbor and international airport, part of which will be covered by insurance. However, for safety \nreasons,  the  airport  requires  short-term  repair  work  on  the  airfield,  drainage  works,  sea  wall \ndefenses, navigation equipment, and communications. \n \n43. \nThe  transport  project  component  comprises:  (i)  rehabilitation  and/or  reinstatement  of \nmaritime navigation aids that have been damaged or destroyed; (ii) procurement of emergency \ninter-island transport capacity for reconstruction works; (iii) rehabilitation of damaged jetties; (iv) \nrepairs to sea walls and quay walls; (v) repairs to causeways; (vi) dredging of harbor basins and \napproach channels; and (vii) rehabilitation of the Mal\u00e9 International Airport. Rehabilitation works \nwill be carried out to restore facilities to pre-tsunami levels or to a higher standard as considered \n\n\fcost-effective in the long run, and, where appropriate, will include coastal protection measures \nto mitigate damage from future natural disasters (Appendix 7). \n  \n44. \nPower. The tsunami completely disrupted the power supply system in at least 95 islands \n(about  48%  of  the  islands  with  electricity)  and  left  the  population  without  electricity  for  days \nbefore  the  first  teams  arrived  to  restore  temporary  electric  power.  The  needs  assessment \nestimated  the  damage  and  the  recovery  needs  of  the  power  sector  to  be  $4.6  million.  The \ntsunami  damaged  24  powerhouses,  104  generators  with  capacities  ranging  from  20  to  150 \nkilowatts (kW), 34 switchboards, more than 121 km of cables of various sizes, 632 distribution \nboxes, and 652 streetlights. \n \n45. \nThe  project  component  includes  rehabilitation  of  the  damaged  power  supply  system. \nThis will consist of supply and installation of new generators and distribution networks, including \ncables and distribution boxes. Streetlights will be installed if necessary. In bigger islands, with \nmore  than  one  generator,  panel  boards  will  be  provided  to  synchronize  operations.  In  islands \nwhere  the  powerhouse  was  badly  damaged,  new  powerhouses  will  be  constructed.  Restoring \nconnections  to  households  will  include  installation  of  new  meters  and  consumer  panels.  This \nwork will restore facilities to pre-tsunami levels or to a higher disaster-resistant standard if this is \nmore cost-effective in the long run (Appendix 8). \n \nFisheries.  According  to  estimates  by  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  Agriculture,  and Marine \n46. \nResources (MFAMR), the total cost for repair and rehabilitation of the fisheries industry will be \nabout  $25  million.15  This  covers  repair  and/or  replacement  of  fishing  vessels,  engines,  fishing \ngear  and  accessories,  fish  processing  equipment,  and  infrastructure.  Immediate  assistance  is \nneeded  by  the  fisheries  sector  to  replace  equipment  and  utensils  lost  by  fish  processors.  The \nMFAMR has identified 128 islands where fish processors have been severely affected and the \nProject  aims  to  support  the  fish  processors  by  providing  them  with  processing  equipment, \nworking capital, and extension services and by strengthening the MFAMR. ADB\u2019s assistance is \nproposed to be $2.6 million, of which about 70% would be for equipment and basic inputs, about \n10%  for  working  capital,  and  the  balance  for  consultant  services,  training,  extension,  and \nadministrative support. \n \nThe  MFAMR,  in  conjunction  with  affected  fish  processors,  will  select,  in  a  participatory \n47. \nmanner, community-based organizations (CBOs) or island development centers (IDCs), who will \nbe responsible for delivering Project inputs and working capital to the affected fish processors. \nThe Project will provide CBOs or IDCs with training so they can provide efficient services to fish \nprocessors (Appendix 9). \n \n48. \nAgriculture.  The  agriculture  sector  has  been  badly  hit,  as  the  tsunami  waves  caused \ntemporary,  semi-permanent,  or  permanent  damage  to  soil  and  water.  Destruction  to  standing \ncrops,  arable  land  and  groundwater,  loss  of  farming  equipment,  and  damage  to  agriculture \ninfrastructure  have  been  substantial.  Declines  in  production  and  yield  levels  of  field  and  other \ncrops,  including  homestead  cultivation  such  as  breadfruit,  mango  and  other  fruit  trees,  is \nsignificant.  The  needs  assessment  estimated  total  losses  to  be  about  $11.1  million.  The \nMFAMR has identified 42 islands where field crops were affected by the tsunami, and 26 islands \nwhere  perennials  and  fruit  trees  were  severely  affected.  The  Project  aims  to  support  affected \nfarmers  in  the  perennial  and  field  crop  sectors  by  providing  them  with  farm  inputs,  tools  and \nequipment, and working capital in order to rehabilitate their farms and restore their livelihoods. \n\n                                                 \n15  The  joint  needs  assessment  has  estimated  a  lower  figure  of  $14.1  million,  which  MFAMR  regards  as  an \n\nunderestimate. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance  is  proposed  to  be  $2.5  million,  of  which  about  70%  would  be  for equipment \nand  basic  inputs,  about  10%  for  working  capital,  and  the  balance  for  consultant  services, \ntraining, extension, and administrative support.  \n \n49.  MFAMR, in conjunction with affected fish processors, will select CBOs or IDCs to deliver \nproject  inputs  and  working  capital  to  the  affected  farmers.  MFAMR  will  verify  the  targeted \nfarmers  with  assistance  from  atoll  offices.  In  order  to  ensure  effective  use  of  project  inputs, \nMFAMR  will  provide  extension  services  to  farmers  through  the  three  mobile  extension  service \nteams,  who  will  identify  the  contaminated  soil  and  water  conditions  in  the  islands  and  provide \nsuitable cultivation methods. Consultant services will be provided to strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of MFAMR and CBOs and IDCs (Appendix 10). \n \nE. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n50. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $25.3  million  equivalent,  including  the  quick-\ndisbursing  component,  which  will  be  entirely  in  foreign  exchange.  For  the  project  component, \nthe  Government  will  contribute  19%  of  the  estimated  cost  of  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation, \nmainly  in  the  form  of  tax  exemption  and  administrative  support.  Since  a  sector  approach  is \nbeing  followed,  the  cost  estimates  are  broken  down  by  sectors  (Table  1  and  Appendixes  6  to \n10). \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \n \n\nA.

The  NDMC  has  been  functioning  as  a  central  agency  for  (i)  collecting  and \nupdating data on damage, and (ii) coordinating the Government\u2019s relief efforts with support from \ninternational community. About 1 month after the disaster, on 31 January 2005, the Government \nadopted a long-term framework for the NDMC. It was considered important to continue the work \nof  NDMC  without  interruption,  but  reorganize  its  work  into  two  areas.  The  functions  of  NDMC \nwill be assigned to a newly created National Economic Recovery and Reconstruction Program \n(NERRP). \n \n53. \nUnder this arrangement, NERRP's tasks will include (i) planning and implementation of \nthe  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  affected  islands,  (ii)  coordinating  the  recovery  of  the \nnational economy, and (iii) planning and implementation of long-term projects within the national \ndevelopment  framework.  The  NERRP  consists  of  staff  from  MOFT  (who  will  be  handling  the \neconomic  recovery)  and  MPND  (who  will  be  dealing  with  housing  and  infrastructure \nreconstruction),  and  staff  from  other  ministries.  MOFT  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the \nProject, while its implementation will be centralized in the NERRP.  \n\n \n54. \nThe Project will be implemented by a centralized project management unit (PMU) to be \ncreated under NERRP, so that the Government does not need to form a new and separate unit. \nMOFT  will,  however,  appoint  a  dedicated  project  manager  to  coordinate  and  oversee \nimplementation,  who  will  be  supported  by  five  sections  under  NERRP  (planning  and \nprogramming, procurement, financial and accounting, monitoring and evaluation, and technical \nand  implementation).  The  project  manager  and  the  NERRP\u2019s  five  existing  sections  will  be  the \nPMU of the Project. The technical ministries and agencies will be the implementing agencies of \nthe  Project.  They  will  assign  their  staff  to  the  PMU  under  the  technical  and  implementation \nsection,  and  will  be  responsible  for  addressing  technical  matters  in  their  respective  areas  of \nexpertise, as follows: \n\n \n(i) \n\nMinistry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Environment and Construction (MEC) in \nthe water supply, sanitation and solid waste management sector; \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nMinistry  of  Atolls  Development  (MOAD),  and  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil \nAviation (MTCA) in the transport sector; \n\nMinistry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources (MFAMR), in agriculture \nand fisheries sectors; and \n\nState Electricity Company Limited (STELCO) in power sector. \n\nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible \n\nfor  (i)  consolidating  subproject  proposals \n\nIn addition, MOAD will support co-ordination of activities at the atolls level. \n\n \n55. \n \n56. \nfrom \nimplementing agencies and submitting them for approval by the project coordinating committee \n(PCC, see below); (ii) preparing bidding documents and procuring civil works, equipment, goods \nand  related  services  for  infrastructure  reconstruction;  (iii)  recommending  the  release  of  grant \nfunds  under  working  capital  schemes  to  the  affected  communities;  (iv)  disbursing  funds  and \ncarrying  out  accounting,  including  preparing  financial  reports;  (v)  preparing  and  submitting \nprogress  reports  to  PCC  and  ADB;  and  (vi)  maintaining  the  website  for  the  Project.  The \nGovernment has agreed to establish the PMU and to appoint the project manager and key PMU \nstaff by end-March 2005. \n \n57. \nTo  ensure  coordination,  the  PCC  will  be  co-chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and \nTreasury and the Minister of Planning and National Development or their respective designates, \nand will include high-level representatives from MPND and the implementing agencies, as well \nas from the Ministry of Gender, Family Development and Social Security and the Department of \nExternal  Resources.  The  PCC  will  guide  the  PMU  on  policy  matters,  and  select  high-priority \nsubprojects proposed by the PMU. The PCC will meet as needed but not less than once every \nthree months. The Project organization structure is in Appendix 12. \n \n58. \nAs  part  of  the  joint  needs  assessment,  and  in  preparation  for  IDA  credit  and  grant \nsupport,  the  World  Bank  has  completed  a  financial  management  assessment  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Tsunami  Relief  and  Reconstruction \nProgram  (TRRP);  and  the  TRRF,  through  which  the  Government  proposes  to  route  all  TRRP \nfunds.  Based  on \nfinalizing \nimplementation arrangements in order to ensure transparency and efficient fiduciary controls. A \nsound  financial  management  system,  incorporating  financial  arrangements,  control  processes, \nand  funds  flow  arrangements,  is  a  requirement  of  the  TRRP,  and  is  being  established  and \ndocumented  in  the  TRRF  operations  manual.  Thus,  while  it  is  recognized  that  public  financial \nmanagement and accountability in the Maldives is at a relatively early stage, there is a strong \nunderstanding  and  commitment  within  the  Government  to  modernize.    Important  steps  have \nalready  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  TRRP  and \nthe TRRF are able to account for project resources and reporting of project expenditures. \n \n59. \nProject  Monitoring  and  Anticorruption  Measures.  ADB\u2019s  EM  staff,  project \nconsultants,  and  periodic  review  missions  will  closely  monitor  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  to  ensure  quality  control,  expeditious  implementation  of  subprojects,  and  rapid \nassistance to MOFT on project implementation matters. The EM staff, consultants, and review \nmissions  will  also  closely  monitor  anticorruption  measures  undertaken  by  the  PCC  and  PMU, \ncarry out random checks on procurement, and on accounts of the Project and subprojects, and \ninspect  facilities  rehabilitated  by  the  Project.  The  anticorruption  measures  adopted  under  the \nProject  include  (i)  strict  financial  management  with  strengthened  Government  monitoring  and \n\nthe  assessment\u2019s \n\nrecommendations, \n\nthe  Government \n\nis \n\n\findependent  monitoring  by  consultants;  (ii)  the  use  of  detailed  subproject  selection  criteria; \n(iii) strong  project  supervision  with  appropriate  consultancy  input;  (iv)  regular  independent \nperformance  auditing;  and  (v)  random  spot  checks  by  EM  staff,  consultants,  and  ADB  review \nmissions.  \n \n60. \nIn addition, the Government will involve CBOs, IDCs, and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) in monitoring project implementation. Consultants and the PMU will determine specific \nmonitoring  indicators  for  outputs  of  sectors  and  subprojects.  The  Government  will  establish  a \ngrievance  mechanism  within  the  existing  Public  Complaints  Bureau  to  give  tsunami-affected \npeople  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  and  an  opportunity  to  submit  their  complaints  related  to \nADB\u2019s proposed assistance. Facilitation units will be established on each affected island to help \nindividuals and communities to access goods and services financed under the Project, or other \nassistance. These units will be established in collaboration with CBOs and NGOs. The PMU will \nalso  publicly  disclose  information  on  procurement  on  the  website  for  the  Project.  The  website \nwill  provide  information  on  financial  statements,  bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract \nawards  for  the  Project  as  well  as  the  list  of  goods  and  services  purchased  and  their  intended \nand  actual  utilization.  ADB\u2019s  EM  staff  and  consultants  will  help  to  create  and  maintain  such  a \nwebsite. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n\n61. \nThe  implementing  agencies,  through  the  PMU,  will  propose  a  list  of  subprojects.  The \nPMU  will  screen  proposals  and  submit  them  to  PCC  for  final  selection.  The  Government  and \nADB have agreed that each subproject must satisfy the following criteria.  \n \n\nIt  should  rehabilitate  or  restore  tsunami-damaged  infrastructure  and  facilities \nbased  on  the  needs  assessment,  and  will  exclude  relief  work  and  projects \naddressing long-term development needs.  \n\nIt should be technically feasible and represent a least-cost alternative.  It should \nbe  financially  viable,  sustainable,  and  cost-effective,  and  incorporates  disaster \nresistant features, where necessary and feasible; \n\nIt  should,  to  the  extent  possible,  involve  local  communities  and  beneficiaries  in \nthe selection, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) as \nmuch as possible.  \n\n(iv) \n\nIt can be completed within the project implementation period.  \n\nIt should not be financed by another agency.  \n\nIt should have a direct social and economic impact (subprojects will be prioritized \non this basis).  Priority will also be given to subprojects that rehabilitate ongoing \nor completed ADB financed projects.  \n\nIt  should  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy \nthe  agreed  environmental  assessment \nframework.  For  subprojects  that  require  an  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE),  the  IEE  should  be  included  in  the  subproject  proposal,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environment  clearance  should  be  obtained  before  the  contract  is \n\n(2002),  and \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nawarded. Any project deemed by ADB to be environmentally an \u2018A\u2019 category will \nnot be eligible for ADB financing.   \n\n(viii) \n\nIt  should  avoid  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  If,  however,  \neither  is  unavoidable  in  the  course  of  the  Project,  it  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  agreed  resettlement  framework \n(Appendix 18) before the award of the subproject contract. \n\n \n62. \nSubproject  proposals  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  in  a  format  to  be  agreed  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  preparation,  submission, \nimplementation, and benefits monitoring and evaluation. The first subproject for each sector will \nbe subject to prior review and approval by ADB before they begin. Each subsequent subproject \ncosting more than $500,000 equivalent will be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. \nThe procedures for selection, approval, and implementation are in Appendix 13. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n63. \nAs  the  Project  is  for  emergency  assistance,  it  will  be  implemented  expeditiously  after \napproval  and  completed  in  24  months.  For  selected  subprojects,  performance  indicators  and \ntime-bound  completion  schedules  will  be  determined  by  the  PMU  in  consultation  with  project \nconsultants and EM staff. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 14. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n64. \nProcurement of goods, services and works will be consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement,  yet  carried  out  expediently  in  order  to  meet  the  contemplated  implementation \nschedule.  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  providing  reconstruction  assistance  after  disasters  allow  for \nconsiderable  flexibility,  so  project  activities  can  start  promptly.  Local  procurement  will  be  the \npreferred  mode  for  all  civil  works  because  of  the  relatively  short  implementation  period,  the \nsmall  size  of  contract  packages,  and  the  wide  geographic  spread  of  the  project  sites. \nCommunity participation in procurement will be encouraged. \n \n65. \nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  including  equipment  and  materials,  will  follow \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  when  the  estimated  contract  cost  is  more  than \n$1 million  equivalent,  and  international  shopping  when  the  estimated  contract  cost  is  up  to \n$1 million  equivalent.  Bidding  periods  of  7\u201315  days  for  international  shopping  are  acceptable. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  below  $100,000  may  be  undertaken  by  direct  purchase, \nallowing  for  3\u20135  days  for  submission  of  quotations.  The  procurement  of  commodities  in  bulk \nshall  be  undertaken  under  normal  competitive  commercial  practices  appropriate  to  the  trade, \nand acceptable to ADB.  Contracts for such specific commodities shall not exceed $1 million. \n \n66. \nNone  of  the  Project\u2019s  individual  civil  works  contracts  is  expected  to  exceed  $3  million. \nHowever, if contract packages are enlarged, civil works contracts with estimated values greater \nthan $3 million will be procured in accordance with international competitive bidding procedures. \nContracts with estimated values of $3 million or less will be procured in accordance with local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  with  bidding  periods  of  21\u201330  days.  \nSmall  and  simple  civil  works,  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less,  may  have  a  15-day  bidding \nperiod.  Pre-qualification  or  a  registration  system  (for  local  contractors)  will  be  used  as \nincorporated  into  the  Government\u2019s  procurement  procedures  and  documents.  To  encourage \ncommunities  to  participate  and  the  use  of  domestic  materials,  community  participation  in \n\n\fprocurement will be pilot tested in the transport, fisheries and agriculture sectors.  Small works \ncontracts  with  estimated  costs  of  $50,000  or  less  may  be  awarded  to  community  groups  or \norganizations, in accordance with practices and procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe procurement of goods, related services, and works through international shopping, \n67. \nlocal  competitive  bidding,  and  other  procurement  methods  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  established  for  TRRF,  if  acceptable  to  ADB.  Initial  scrutiny  suggests \nthat  the  Government\u2019s  existing  procedures  and  bidding  documents  are  broadly  in  line  with \nADB\u2019s  requirements.16  For  international  shopping,  local  competitive  bidding,  direct  purchase, \nand commodity procurements, post facto approval procedures will be followed. However, if ADB \ndoes not approve the award or terms of the contract, the Government will not use grant funds to \nfinance the contract. If the grant funds have been used, the Government will refund to ADB any \nsuch payments. \n \n68. \nprocurement under international competitive bidding procedures. \n \n\nPrior review by ADB of invitations for bids and bidding documents shall be required for \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n69. \nGiven the tight implementation schedule and the capacity of IAs, consulting services will \nbe  needed  to  help  the  PMU  to  (i)  prioritize  subprojects;  (ii)  carry  out  technical  surveys  and \ndetailed  designs;  (iii)  prepare  cost  estimates;  (iv)  prepare  subproject  proposals  in  accordance \nwith  Government  and  ADB  requirements  and  selection  criteria;  and  (v)  supervise  and  monitor \nworks to ensure quality control and transparency among contractors and communities carrying \nout  smaller  works.  The  Project  will  require  a  total  of  27  person-months  of  international \nconsultants  and  63  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  (outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 15). \n \nThe Government has agreed that all consultants will be engaged by ADB, in consultation \n70. \nwith the Government, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Since  the \nProject will be completed within 24 months, expeditious selection and fielding of the consultants \nwill be necessary. Accordingly, ADB has agreed with the Government that direct engagement of \nindividual  consultants  be  undertaken,  as  provided  for  under  these  guidelines.  General \nconditions  for  direct  engagement  under  the  Project  require  that  the  consultant  (i)  be  currently \nengaged or have prior substantial and satisfactory experience in previous ADB or World-Bank-\nfinanced  damage  rehabilitation;  and  (ii)  have  been  selected  for  ongoing  or  previous  projects \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  have  performed  satisfactorily \npursuant  to  the  terms  of  such  prior  engagements.  These  arrangements  provide  for  efficient \nrecruitment of consultants under the circumstances. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n71. \nGiven the urgency of the Project, ADB has approved advance action for the procurement \nof  goods,  services  and  works,  provided  this  has  taken  place  on  or  after  1  January  2005.  The \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB recommended adjustments to available bidding documents such as (i) addition of a \u201ccorrupt practices\u201d clause \nin all bidding documents, and the waiving of performance securities only for works contracts below $500,000 in the \nbidding documents for works, and (ii) in bidder qualification evaluation, removal of the restrictive practice of giving \npreference  to  contractors  with  40%  local  labor,  and  inclusion  of  a  list  of  eligible  countries,  as  foreign  firms  are \nallowed to participate in ADB\u2019s local competitive bidding. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nGovernment was advised that approval of such advance action did not commit ADB to finance \nany part of the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n72. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  expeditious \ndisbursements  are  key  to  effective  and  timely  emergency  assistance.    Immediately  after  the \ngrant  and  loan  have  become  effective,  the  Government  will  establish  three  imprest  accounts \nunder  the  TRRF.  Two  imprest  accounts  will  be  deposited  with  quick  disbursing  component  of \nTEAP:  (i)  Account  1\u2013$4.7  million  (grant);  and  (ii)  Account  2\u2013$1.8  million  (Special  Fund \nResources  loan).  In  addition,  the  third  imprest  account  (Account  3)  will  be  deposited  with  the \nproject  component  of  TEAP\u2013$2.9  million  (grant).  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established, \noperated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  the  Operations  Manual  of  the  TRRF  and  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  imprest  accounts  shall  be  checking  accounts,  which  will \nfacilitate  withdrawal  of  funds  to  meet  project  expenditures  whenever  needed.  Interest  income \nearned  from  the  imprest  accounts,  if  any,  shall  be  refunded  to  ADB.  ADB's  statement  of \nexpenditures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances to the \nimprest accounts, applicable to contracts amounting to $1.0 million or less for the importation of \ncommodities in bulk and contracts amounting to $100,000 or less for the other importations and \nproject expenditures. \n\n8. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n73. \nThe Project provides for retroactive financing of immediate imports and rehabilitation of \nkey infrastructure and facilities. ADB has agreed to provide retroactive financing of up to 30% of \nthe  quick-disbursing  and  project  component  of  the  Project  (except  consulting  services)  for \neligible  expenditures  incurred  not  earlier  than  1  January  2005,  provided  that  the  expenditures \nare  procured  in  accordance  with  agreed  procedures.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \nprovision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Reports \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n74. \nThe  PMU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  each  project  component.  \nThese accounts will be adequate to identify the goods and services financed by grant and loan \nproceeds, the financing source, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. The accounts will \nbe  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \naudited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  in  English  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later \nthan 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \n \n75. \nAll  project  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  performance  audits  to  ensure  their \ntransparency and to provide an objective and independent assessment. The performance audit \nwill be conducted annually and randomly during project implementation, and will be carried out \nby external auditors selected by the Government in consultation with ADB. In addition, ADB will \nconduct  project  procurement  audits  during  implementation  as  part  of  its  regular  reviews.  ADB \nalso  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  a  \u201cspecial  audit\u201d  focusing  on  governance,  financial \naccountability  (e.g.  certification  of  accounts),  and  transparency  soon  after  completion  of  the \nProject. \n \n\n\fb. \n\nReports \n\n76. \nThe PMU will prepare brief progress statements and submit these to PCC and ADB at \nthe  end  of  each  month.  In  addition,  the  PMU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  PCC  and  ADB. \nWithin 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will provide ADB through \nPCC  an  overall  project  completion  report  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  project  design, \ncosts, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as \nrequested by ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n77. \nThe  PMU  will  carry  out  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  accordance \nwith  baseline  indicators  and  monitoring  targets,  which  will  be  developed  for  each  sector  and \nsubproject  before  implementation  for  monitoring  purposes  as  well  as  for  checking  against \nselection criteria.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n78. \nADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  (at  least  once  every  6  months)  throughout  project \nimplementation. Given the relatively short implementation period and emergency nature of the \nProject,  no  midterm  review  will  be  conducted,  unless  deemed  necessary  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits and Financial Sustainability \n\n79. \nThe  selected  subprojects  will  be  technically  feasible,  cost-effective,  and  will  represent \nleast-cost  alternatives.    If  it  is  appropriate,  they  will  upgrade  the  infrastructure  so  that  similar \ncatastrophes  can  be  withstood  and  environmental  standards  can  be  met.  A  rapid  economic \nassessment  was  undertaken  based  on  available  data  and  simplified  assumptions  for  each \nProject  component\u2014water  supply  and  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  transport, \npower;  fisheries  and  agriculture.    The  Project\u2019s  weighted  average  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) is estimated to be 19%. \n \n80. \nA  broad  assessment  of  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  each  project  component \nhas been made, based on available data and simplified assumptions.  During implementation, \nthe  PMU  and  the  PCC  will  evaluate  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  subprojects  by  ensuring \nthat  the  Government  has  sufficient  resources  to  meet  future  recurrent  costs.  The  ADF  loan \nfunds  will  not  represent  a  significant  debt  burden  for  the  Government,  since  they  are \nreallocations  of  loan  savings  from  ongoing  projects,  which  had  been  factored  in  by  the \nGovernment in its debt service commitments.  The funds will be channeled through TRRF, for \nwhich adequate fiduciary controls will be established, and ADB subprojects will be screened by \nthe PMU and PCC. This will ensure that the funds will be used for the intended purposes and \nthat Project benefits will be realized.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Other Impacts \n\nPoverty  Impact.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  regenerate \n81. \nthe  economy,  rehabilitate  the  public  infrastructure  and  public  utilities,  generate  livelihoods  and \nemployment, and create social cohesion. It will help restore access to public infrastructure and \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nservices. It will help to maintain clean living conditions through community-based water supply, \nsanitation  and  solid  waste  management  programs.  The  Project  will  also  help  re-establish  lost \nagricultural and fishing incomes through livelihood programs targeted at agricultural and fishing \nindividuals,  especially  women  who  engage  in  home  gardening  and  fish  processing.  The \ninterventions  proposed  within  each  sector  will  help  restore  the  livelihoods  of  many  tsunami-\naffected  and  internally  displaced  people.  The  priority  given  to  providing  unskilled  work  to \naffected  people,  including  women,  will  be  an  important  intervention  for  people  who  cannot  re-\nestablish  their  livelihoods  and  are  living  in  temporary  shelters.  The  Project  will  help  to  restore \nthe  confidence  and  dignity  of  people  and  communities  affected  by  the  tsunami.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16.   \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n82. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002).17  An  IEE  was  conducted  to  identify  potential  impacts.  It  showed  that  no  significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts  were  foreseen  and  therefore  a  full-scale  environmental  impact \nassessment was unlikely to be required. The IEE focused on potential impacts associated with \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of maritime transport and protection structures, rehabilitation of \ncommunity  power  supply  schemes  and  community  electrification  services,  sewage  and \nsanitation  systems,  solid  waste  management,  and  the  provision  of  working  capital  for \ncommunity  fish  processing  and  island  agriculture.  While  some  components  will  make  an \nimmediate contribution to the natural and human environment, others will be carefully designed \nand  implemented  to  ensure  no  significant  adverse  impacts  are  associated  with  them.  The \nagencies  involved  in  the  Project  are  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and \nprocedures. Subproject selection and implementation will follow the environmental assessment \nand review procedures prepared for this Project. The summary IEE is in Appendix 17. \n \nD. \n\nResettlement Issues \n\n83. \nThe tsunami displaced more than 12,500 people from their islands and destroyed more \nthan 4,000 houses. Homeless people are living temporarily in makeshift public shelters or with \nrelatives and host families. The Government's policy on \"resettlement of population displaced or \naffected by the Tsunami\" stresses that the relocation of displaced households will be a voluntary \nprocess which will be carried out in consultation and agreement with the households as well as \ntheir  host  communities,  if  any.  It  emphasizes  that  Government  will  inform  all  relocating \nhouseholds of their entitlements: compensation for damaged houses and lost assets, relocation \nallowance,  transitional  support  and  development  assistance,  and  access  to  \u2018socioeconomic \nservices and utilities\u2019. On an island that is habitable and safe after the tsunami, each internally \ndisplaced  household  will  receive  compensation  for  its  lost  dwelling  and  other  structures  to \nenable  them  to  be  reconstructed or  repaired at  their  original  location.  If  the  original  location is \nseverely eroded or difficult to reclaim, the household will receive a new plot of land on the same \nisland  to  construct  its  house  and  other  structures.  Alternatively,  the  household  may  apply  for \npermanent resettlement on a \u201dfocus/safe\u201d island. Applications for such permanent resettlement \nmay  be  made  by  an  individual  household  or  an  entire  island  community.  Households  that  are \nliving  temporarily  on  \u2018safe\u2019  islands  after  the  tsunami  may  apply  for  permanent  resettlement  on \n\u201dfocus/safe\u201d islands. These islands will become self-reliant in emergency management, with an \nearly  warning  system,  well-built  jetties  and  harbors,  and  improved  communications  facilities. \nThey will be regional centers where economic growth is expected. On islands made unsafe by \nthe  tsunami,  each  household  will  be  encouraged,  but  not  forced,  to  relocate  to  a  \u201cfocus/safe\u201d \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n\n\fisland.  If  households  decide  to  continue  to  live  on  an  unsafe  island  or  want  to  return  from  a \ntemporary  \u2018safe\u2019  island  to  their  original  island  even  though  it  is  unsafe,  the  Government  will \nrebuild  the  basic  infrastructure  and  other  facilities  on  such  islands,  and  will  help  people  to \nreconstruct  their  houses  and  other  structures.  Each  displaced  household  will  receive  a \n\u201dresettlement  entitlement\u201d  before  relocation  \u201dwhich  would  be  an  agreed  lump  sum  amount  of \nmoney\u201d  in  addition  to  compensation  for  lost  assets,  assistance  to  find  housing  sites  or \nagricultural  sites,  transitional  support  and  development  assistance  such  as  land  preparation, \ncredit facilities, training or employment opportunities.  \n \n84. \nThe  Project  will  help  to  restore  damaged  transport  infrastructure  and  facilities,  water \nsupply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  power  and  fisheries  infrastructure  and \nagricultural  lands.  Most  rehabilitation  and  restoration  work  will  take  place  where  the  original \ninfrastructure  is  located,  so  emergency  rehabilitation  works are  unlikely to  generate significant \nresettlement.  However,  if  any  subproject  activity  triggers  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguards, MOFT will formulate an appropriate resettlement plan in consultation with affected \nhouseholds  and  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  18),  and \nsubmit it to ADB for review and approval before awarding civil contracts.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\nA potential risk is that, despite strong Government commitment, implementation could be \n85. \nhampered  by  slow  approval  procedures  and  lack  of  adequate  capacity  in  the  implementing \nagencies.  Time-consuming  approval  procedures  and  slow  implementation  are  the  two  main \nconcerns.  Based  on  detailed  discussions  with  the  Government,  ADB\u2019s  assessment  is  that  the \nGovernment  is  strongly  committed  to  the  timely  and  effective  completion  of  the  Project.  The \nGovernment has streamlined approval procedures for all projects related to reconstruction and \neconomic  recovery.  Furthermore,  to  ensure  coordination,  a  project  coordinating  committee \n(PCC) will be established. The PCC will have the highest level of political commitment and will \nbe co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and Treasury and the Minister of Planning and National \nDevelopment  or  their  respective  designates,  and  will  include  high-level  representatives  from \nMPND and the implementing agencies, as well as the Ministry of Gender, Family Development \nand Social Security and Department of External Resources. The PCC will provide guidance to \nthe PMU on policy matters, and will select high-priority subprojects proposed by the PMU. The \nselected  IAs  have  considerable  experience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects  and  are \nfamiliar  with  ADB  procedures.  Specialized  consultancy \ninputs  will  provide  additional \nimplementation  assistance  to  the  PMU  and  the  IAs.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution  to  the \nProject will be in the form of exemption of taxes and duties, and administrative support during \nthe 2-year implementation period of the Project.  \n \n86. \nGovernance-related  issues,  including  corruption,  constitute  another  risk.  These  issues \nwill  be  addressed  by  detailed  subproject  selection  criteria,  transparent  implementation  and \nmonitoring  mechanisms,  and  specific  financial  controls,  including  regular  and  random  audits. \nThese will include strict construction supervision and consultant support and close monitoring by \nthe EM and ADB headquarters staff. Random procurement and annual performance auditing at \nthe  executing  agency  level  will  also  be  carried  out.  In  addition,  the  newly  established  NERRP \nwill  have  specialized  units  to  deal  specifically  with  planning  and  programming;  finance  and \naccounting; procurement; technical issues and implementation; and monitoring and evaluation. \nA project manager will help to select and implement subprojects. The Government will establish \na grievance mechanism to give tsunami-affected people an opportunity to be heard and submit \nany  complaints  related  to  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance.  Facilitation  units  will  be  established  to \nhelp  individuals  and  communities  to  access  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  or  benefit \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nfrom  other  assistance  available  for  tsunami-affected  people.  The  units  will  be  established  in \ncollaboration  with  CBOs  and  NGOs.  The  PMU  will  also  publicly  disclose  information  on \nprocurement  for  the  Project  and  NERRP  will  establish  a  website  with  information  on  financial \nstatements,  bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract  awards.  Checks  and  balances  will  also \nbe  maintained  by  consultants,  who,  in  addition  to  providing  specialized  input  into  design  of \nsubprojects,  will  also  conduct  random  checks  during  the  Project\u2019s  implementation  and  help  to \nprovide  capacity  in  areas  such  as  monitoring  and  evaluation.  In  addition,  the  Government  will \ninvolve  CBOs, \nin  monitoring  project \nimplementation.  To  facilitate  this,  consultants  and  PMU  will  determine  specific  monitoring \nindicators for outputs of sectors and subprojects.  \n \n\nIDCs,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n87. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:     \n \n\nThe Government will ensure that immediately after grant and loan effectiveness, \na  centralized  PMU  will  have  been  created  and  a  full  time  Project  Manager  will \nhave been appointed.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all \nsubprojects are properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  cash  and  in-kind  assistance  provided  to \nindividual  beneficiaries  under  the  Project  will  be  against  suitable  identification \nand verification in accordance with arrangements agreed between ADB and the \nGovernment. All records, receipts, certificates and other documents related to the \ncash  and  in-kind  assistance  will  be  properly  maintained  and  made  available  to \nADB at any time. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the Executing Agency and each IA will actively \nseek community participation in the selection, design, and implementation of all \nworks  carried  out  under  the  Project.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  CBOs, \nIDCs and NGOs are involved in project monitoring. \n\nThe Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigation measures in \naccordance with (a) the Government\u2019s environmental regulations and (b) ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  are  incorporated  into  all  subproject  designs  and \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  agreed  environmental \nassessment  framework  is  implemented;  that  any  subproject  for  which  an  IEE  is \nrequired includes such an IEE in the subproject proposal; and that a subproject \nfor  which  Government  environmental  clearance  is  required  obtains  such \nclearance prior to the award of any contracts for that subproject.  \n\n \n\nThe Government will ensure that the relocation of the displaced persons will be \ncompleted as per the Government\u2019s policy framework and procedural guidelines \napplicable  to  the  Project,  which  are  outlined  in  the  agreed  Resettlement \nFramework. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible,  subprojects  will  avoid \ninvoluntary resettlement. In the event involuntary resettlement is required for any \nsubproject,  then  the  Government  will  prepare  a  Resettlement  Plan  (RP)  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)18  and  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework; \nand submit it to ADB for review and approval before resettlement is initiated. The \nRPs  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  persons  and  project  reporting  will  provide \ninformation on resettlement. \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender \nand  Development  (1998),19  (a)  project  interventions  take  into  account  the \ndifferent impacts and needs of women and men; (b) special features are built into \nsubprojects  to  facilitate  and  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  and  to  ensure \ntangible  benefits  to  women;  (c)  project  reporting  reflects  gender-specific  issues \nand gender-disaggregated data, where applicable; and (d) women will be eligible \nfor equal opportunities and pay generated under the Project.  \n\n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  spot  audits  at  any  time  during \nProject implementation in order to address governance and transparency issues, \nas well as to determine the degree to which project funds have been effectively \nand  efficiently  utilized  to  implement  the  Project  and  achieve  its  objectives, \noutputs  and  performance  indicators.  ADB  also  reserves  the  right  to  investigate \ndirectly, or through its agents, any possible financial or management impropriety \nin  conducting  the  Project.  The  Government  shall  cooperate with  any  such  audit \nand  investigation  and  extend  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all \nrelevant books and records, as well as engagement of independent auditors and \nexperts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such  audits  and \ninvestigations. All external costs related to the audits and investigations shall be \nborne by the Project. \n\nThe  Government  will  establish  a  grievance  review  mechanism  within  existing \nPublic  Complaints  Bureau  to  address  complaints  and  grievances  related  to  the \nProject.  Such  mechanism  will  be  in  the  form  of  a  quasi  judicial  proceeding  to \nfacilitate  access  to  justice  in  respect  of  grievances  submitted  by  individuals  or \ncommunities with assistance of facilitation units, island based magistrates, IDCs, \nCBOs and NGOs. Facilitation units will be established on each affected island to \nenable  individuals/communities  to  use  the  grievance  review  mechanism;  and \naccess goods and services financed under the Project and other assistance for \ntsunami-affected  people.  Such \nin \ncollaboration with CBOs and NGOs. \n\nfacilitation  units  will  be  established \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Grant and Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  Operations  Manual  of  the  TRRF,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  will \n88. \nhave  been  approved  and  made  effective  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  Treasury  of  the \nMaldives. \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1995.

A  joint  needs \nassessment mission began work on 5 January 2005. The United Nations also participated in the \nmission, along with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). A follow-up mission on \n1\u20134  February  2005  finalized  the  assessment,  revising  the  initial  estimates  based  on  new  data \nand  extensive  comments  received  from  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders.  The \nGovernment endorsed the findings of the report on 6 February 2005. \n\nA. \n\nEstimated Damage and Financing Needs \n\nThe  tsunami  had  a  serious  impact  on  the  Maldives  by  inflicting  extensive  physical \n3. \ndamage,  loss  of  life  and  livelihoods,  and  displacement  of  people.  The  current  displaced \npopulation is estimated to be about 12,500. About 6,700 people are internally displaced in their \noriginal islands and about 5,800 are displaced on other islands. Eighty-three people have died \nand twenty-five are still missing feared dead. Out of the 199 inhabited islands of the Maldives, \n13  islands  were  severely  impacted  with  total  destruction,  56  islands  sustained  major  physical \ndamage,  and  121  islands  moderate  damage  due  to  flooding.    Severe  damage  was  caused  to \nhouses,  tourist  resorts,  boats  and  other  fishing  equipment,  schools,  health  facilities,  transport \nand  communication  equipment,  water  and  sanitation,  and  electricity  infrastructure.  There  has \nalso  been  substantial  damage  to  agricultural  crops  and  perennial  trees.  Farms,  homestead \nplots,  and  aquifers  have  been  salinized.  The  physical  damage  has  led  to  severe  human \nsuffering  and  large  segments  of  the  population  have  lost  their  dwellings,  lifetime  assets, \nsavings, and sources of livelihood. Many displaced families are now living in temporary shelters \nor with relatives.  \n\n4. \nTotal  damages  are  estimated  to  be  about  $470  million,  close  to  62%  of  GDP  (Table \nA2.1). About $298 million of these are direct damages; $172 million are indirect losses. The cost \nof  direct  damages  is  about  8%  of  the  replacement  cost  of  the  entire  national  capital  stock, \nestimated  to  be  about  $3.8  billion  at  2004  prices.  The  tourism  sector  has  incurred  the  largest \ndirect damages, with losses estimated at $100 million (of which half is insured), followed by the \nhousing sector with losses close to $65 million.  \n\n5. \nThe largest indirect losses also occurred in the tourism sector, which has seen a sharp \ndrop  in  tourist  arrivals  (as  of  end-January  2005,  around  6,000  tourists  are  in  the  Maldives  as \ncompared with more than 16,000 at the same time last year).  \n\nB. \n\nEstimated Reconstruction Costs  \n\nOverall Needs. Reconstruction costs for some sectors may be higher than total losses \n6. \nbecause  of  the  need  to  rebuild  to  higher  standards  to  reduce  vulnerability  (e.g.  housing)  and \nbecause current construction or environmental standards are higher than when original facilities \nwere built (e.g. sanitation), or because modern equipment or supplies are of higher quality and \nprovide  improved  services  (e.g.  health,  education).  Some  of  the  indirect  losses  cannot  be \nrecovered: production losses from fishing and agriculture, and tourism cancellations cannot be \nrestored.  The  financing  needs  have  been  divided  into  short-term  and  long-term  needs.  The \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n  Appendix 2 \n\nshort-term  needs  reflect  investments  needed  urgently  within  the  next  6  months;  the  long-term \nneeds  cover  the  period  from  6  months  to  3  years.  The  overall  financing  needs  for  the  next  3 \nyears  are  expected  to  be  $406  million;  of  this,  $120  million  will  be  needed  within  the  next  6 \nmonths.  \n\n7. \nPublic Finance Needs. The needs for public financing are lower than overall financing \nneeds  because  parts  of  the  reconstruction  cost  will  be  absorbed  by  the  private  sector \n(insurance, households, and businesses). Estimated needs for public finance include the cost of \nrestoring  basic  services,  infrastructure,  and  housing,  as  well  as  the  cost  of  certain  mitigation \nmeasures  made  urgent  by  the  tsunami.  In  addition,  the  tsunami  has  led  to  a  government \nrevenue shortfall of $60 million. Total public financing needs over the next 3 years are expected \nto be about $304 million; of this, housing is the largest component.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Estimated Losses and Financing Needs  \n($ million) \n\n \n\nSector \n\n \n\nDirect \nLosses \n\nLosses \nIndirect \nLossesa \n\nCost of Reconstructionb \n\nTotal \nLosses \n\nNeeds \nNext 6 \nMonths \n\nFor \nMedium \n-Termc \n\nTotal \nNeeds \nCost \n\nPublic \nFinancing \nNeedsd \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n8.4 \n4.9 \n22.2 \n18.4 \n10.0 \n5.8 \n4.8 \n2.0 \n1.9 \n17.4 \n3.7 \n0.7 \n\n12.7 \n7.3 \n51.8 \n27.2 \n90.0 \n8.3 \n6.3 \n25.0 \n2.8 \n0.0 \n6.1 \n3.7 \n\n21.1 \n12.2 \n74.0 \n45.6 \n100.0 \n14.1 \n11.1 \n27.0 \n4.6 \n17.4 \n9.8 \n4.4 \n\n15.5 \n5.6 \n64.8 \n13.1 \n100.0 \n13.2 \n10.8 \n20.3 \n4.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n130.0 \n11.9 \n0.3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n30.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n15.5 \n5.6 \n64.8 \n13.1 \n230.0 \n25.1 \n11.1 \n20.3 \n4.6 \n30.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n \nEducation \nHealth \nHousing \nWater and sanitation \nTourism \nFisheries \nAgriculture \nTransport \nPower \nLivelihoods \nEnvironment \nDisaster risk \nmanagement \nOther costs for new \nHosts islandse \nAdministration, etc.e \nTotal \n \nLosses/costs as percent of GDP (2004 est.) \nEstimated revenue loss5 \nTotal financing gap including revenue loss \nTotal financing gap including revenue loss as percent of GDP \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na   Indirect loss estimates, particularly for tourism and livelihoods, are not robust. \nb   Reconstruction  costs  in  some  sectors  are  higher  than  damages  because  (i)  some  partially  damaged  houses  will \nneed  to  be  fully  rebuilt  because  the  original  islands  are  not  livable  in  anymore,  and  (ii)  new  environmental \nstandards apply to new facilities. \n\n21.1 \n12.2 \n74.0 \n45.6 \n0.0 \n14.1 \n11.1 \n24.9 \n4.6 \n17.4 \n9.8 \n4.4 \n\n50.0 \n406.3 \n54% \n \n \n \n\n35.0 \n286.2 \n \n \n \n \n\n15.0 \n120.1 \n \n \n \n \n\n50.0 \n304.2 \n40% \n60.0 \n364.2 \n48% \n\n50.0 \n470.1 \n62% \n \n \n\n50.0 \n297.9 \n\n0.0 \n172.2 \n\nc   The medium term covers the period from 6 to 36 months. \nd   Losses in tourism and transport will be covered by insurance and financial resources available to owners. \ne   Preliminary estimates. \nSource: Estimates of the Joint Needs Assessment undertaken by the Asian Development Bank, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, the United Nations, and the World Bank for the Government. \n \nC. \n \nEducation. Damages in the education sector range from damaged school infrastructure \n8. \nto insufficient teaching staff (because some expatriate teachers left). Thirty-seven percent of the \nschools  require  varying  degrees  of  repair  and  rehabilitation.  Six  have  been  completely \n\nDamage and Recovery Needs by Sector \n\n15.0 \n\n10.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\ndestroyed.  Replacement  of  provisions  for  the  affected  schoolchildren  is  an  immediate  priority, \nalong  with  the  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  damaged  school  facilities  and  construction  of \ntemporary additional classrooms. The cost is estimated to be $21.1 million.  \n\nHealth and Nutrition. Critical emergency needs such as safe drinking water, food, and \n9. \nemergency  medicines  are  in  place  in  the  affected  islands.  People  who  lost  their  homes  have \nbeen  provided  temporary  shelters,  and  people  reporting  major  injuries  have  been  promptly \nattended  to.  The  critical  challenge  now  is  to  sustain  these  inputs  until  more  permanent \narrangements  are  in  place,  and  to  make  the  damaged  health  facilities  functional  as  early  as \npossible. In addition, there is a need for short-term food assistance for displaced families in 13 \nislands.. The total cost of rehabilitating the health sector is expected to be $12.2 million.  \n\nHousing.  Private  housing  suffered  severe  damage.  The  wave  damaged  structural  and \n10. \nnonstructural elements of houses, breaking boundary walls and facades, and indirectly leading \nto houses, many of which had no foundations, collapsing. The preliminary assessment reports \n1,847 houses totally destroyed and 3,500 partially damaged. For the houses to be built anew, \nthe  Government  has  proposed  a  two-stage  housing  reconstruction  plan.  In  the  first  stage,  a \nbasic dwelling unit will be constructed. In the second stage, financial incentives will be provided \nfor households to extend, modify, or improve the basic unit. Reconstruction costs are estimated \nat $74 million.  \n\n11. \nFisheries. Because of the tsunami, 120 fishing vessels were lost or totally destroyed, 50 \nfishing vessels were partially damaged or lost equipment, 5 reef fishing boats lost equipment, 16 \nocean  cages  were  lost,  374  fish  processors  lost  equipment,  and  8  boatsheds  and  2  fishery \ninstitutes  were  damaged.  The  estimated  recovery  cost  for  the  damaged  or  lost  vessels  and \nprovision of necessary equipment is $14.1 million. \n\n12. \nAgriculture.  The  tsunami  damaged  field  crops  in  2,103  farms;  destroyed  backyard \ncrops and agricultural tools in 11,678 homesteads; and damaged more than 700,000 fruit trees \nand 840,000 timber trees in inhabited islands. The damage to land and groundwater resources \nis  severe  in  35  agricultural  islands,  and  saline  water  intrusion  has  affected  112  inhabited \nislands. Recovery needs are estimated at $11.1 million. The reestablishment of the agricultural \ncrops  will  involve  improvement  of  soil,  forestry,  and  water  resources,  importation  of  planting \nmaterial, and provision of extension services, some of which will have to be obtained from other \ncountries.  \n\n13.  Water  Supply,  Sanitation  and  Solid  Waste  Management.  Preliminary  estimates \nsuggest the potential loss of up to 1,000 community rainwater tanks, 6,000 household rainwater \ntanks  and  20,000  m3  of  rainwater  supplies.  Roof  water  harvesting  piping  and  gutter  systems \nhave also been damaged, affecting an estimated 5,000 households. Up to 850 well pumps are \nestimated  to  have  been  lost  as  a  result  of  flooding.  In  addition,  the  quality  of  groundwater \nsupplies in 36 islands may have been compromised due to saline and sewage contamination. In \naddition, it is estimated that an approximate 5,000 toilets and 3,500 septic tanks may need to be \nprovided, while there is also small bore sewer loss in highly affected areas. Recovery needs are \nestimated at $45.6 million. \n\n14. \nTourism.  The  impact  from  the  tsunami  is  significant  for  both  the  private  and  public \nsectors. Direct damage to the tourism infrastructure and other related businesses is estimated \nat over $100 million, some of which will be covered by insurance. More significant is the loss of \nrevenue from the downturn in tourist arrivals. The loss in total tourism receipts is estimated at \n$130  million.  The  key  to  minimizing the  financial  impact  is  to  bring  tourists  back  as  quickly  as \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n  Appendix 2 \n\npossible.  This  requires  marketing  focusing  on  the  travel  trade  and  potential  tourists  with  the \nmessage that the tourism sector is operating normally, that most resorts were unaffected, that it \nis safe to visit the Maldives, and that visitors are welcome.  \n\nTransportation  and  Communications.  The  damage  to  transport  and  communication \n15. \ninfrastructure (harbors, jetties, causeways, navigational aids, airports, telecoms) was less than \noriginally feared. About 4,200 m length of quay wall, and 15,000 m of harbor or sea walls and \nbreakwaters  have  been  damaged  or  destroyed.    Dredging  will  be  needed  to  remove  about \n370,000  m3  tsunami-inflicted  siltation.  Five  causeways  have  been  partly  damaged.  While  the \ntelecommunications sector initially completely failed, all connections were restored by 7 January \n2005.  It  is  estimated  that  about  one  third  of  navigation  aids  were  damaged  or  destroyed. \nRecovery costs will amount to about $27 million. \n\n16. \nPower.  The  tsunami  damaged  the  electric  power  supply  system  in  95  islands  (about \n48% of the islands with electricity) and there was no electricity for several days. The damaged \nfacilities  include:  24  power  houses,  104  generators,  652  streetlights,  34  switchboards,  632 \ndistribution  boxes,  and  more  than  121  kilometers  of  cables.  The  Government  is  planning  to \nrestore the electricity supply systems in all affected islands to pre-tsunami levels. The recovery \nneeds amount to $4.65 million, covering the installation of new equipment. \n\nPublic Administration. A preliminary assessment of damages is $50 million. However, \n17. \nfurther assessments of the damage to public offices such as island offices and courts may be \nneeded. Repair of public offices is vital to enable them to function effectively in support of the \nrecovery efforts. \n\nD. \n\nExternal Financing Needs \n\n18. \nThe  government  provided  swift  relief  to  the  affected  islands  and  is  now  engaged  in \nplanning and executing a reconstruction program. However, it faces a financing gap estimated \nat $364 million, so external finance has been sought.  At the end of February, total commitments \nof  cash  assistance  amounted  to  $61.6  million,  of  which  $25.7  million  has  been  received.  The \nWorld  Bank  has  provided  $14  million  in  a  mixture  of  grants  and  credits.  The  Government  of \nJapan has committed $20 million of grants. However, it is clear that foreign financing received or \npledged so far falls far short of the estimated reconstruction needs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nMACROECONOMIC IMPACT \n\nMacroeconomic Performance Before the Tsunami \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Maldives  achieved  a  robust  annual  average  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \n1. \ngrowth  of  7.2%  over  1997\u20132003  and  graduated  from  least  developed  country  (LDC)  status  in \nDecember 2004.  \n \nThe Maldives\u2019 most important economic sector is tourism, which in 2003 accounted for \n2. \n33%  of  GDP  and  grew  by  15%  in  that  year.  Other  important  sectors  include  transport  and \ncommunications  (14%  of  GDP),  manufacturing  (8%  of  GDP)  and  fisheries  (7%  of  GDP). \nSustained  growth \ntransportation  and \ncommunications, and wholesale and retail trade. Despite a modest share of around 3% of GDP, \nagriculture is important to the island economies because it supplies food security and provides \nemployment\u2014particularly for women in the remote atolls. \n\ntourism  stimulated  growth \n\nin  construction, \n\nin \n\nThe Maldives is an open economy because it needs to import almost everything except \n3. \nfish  products,  and  to  earn  foreign  exchange  from  tourism  and  fish  products  to  finance  its \nimports. The Maldives' fundamental reliance on the two export sectors\u2014tourism and fisheries\u2014\nmakes it highly vulnerable to internal and external shocks.  \n \n4. \nOver the period 1999\u20132004, the Maldives has run an average budget deficit of 4.3% of \nGDP.  Both  current  and  capital  expenditures  have  been  rising  since  1999.  Several \ndevelopments,  including  the  high  priority  given  to  human  development\u2014particularly  for \ncommunity  programs,  social  security,  and  welfare\u2014and  the  sharp  increase  in  housing  and \ninfrastructure, explain the recent jump in current and capital expenditures. On the revenue side, \nthe tax to GDP ratio has been stagnant over the past 4 years. The Maldives\u2019 fiscal revenue is \nbased primarily on import duties, income from tourism, dividends from state-owned enterprises, \nand resort lease rents. In addition to its own budgetary resources, the Maldives has benefited \nfrom bilateral grants, although since 2001 revenue from grants has been declining. \n \n5. \nThe Government\u2019s revenue stream is highly vulnerable to external factors. Tourism tax \ncollection depends on the number of tourists. Bilateral grants steadily diminished from 4.5% of \nGDP in 1996 to 1.4% of GDP in 2003. Before 2003, the fiscal deficit was automatically financed \nfrom the ways and means account (WMA) at the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA). Starting \nfrom 2004, the Government adopted a policy of not resorting to automatic financing of the deficit \nfrom the WMA. Inflation has remained low in recent years, ranging from \u20133% to 3%. Inflation in \n2003  was  \u20132.9%,  compared  with  0.9%  in  2002.  This  is  the  lowest  inflation  rate  in  12  years. \nPublic debt has continued to grow and reached the equivalent of 46.5% of GDP in 2003. Public \nexternal debt amounted to 30% of GDP in 2003.  \n \n6. \nExports  and  imports  grew  rapidly  during  2003.  The  current  account  deficit  widened  as \ngrowth in imports exceeded growth in exports. With a large capital account surplus, the overall \nbalance  of  payments  improved  from  a  deficit  of  $21.4  million  in  2001  to  a  surplus  of  $74.3 \nmillion in 2003. Reserves currently amount to about $200 million. Bearing in mind the openness \nof  the  economy,  the  amount  of  short-term  external  debt,  and  the  potential  for  capital  flight  by \nresidents, reserves are relatively low. \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n  Appendix 3 \n\nB. \n\nThe Macroeconomic Impact of the Tsunami \n\n7. \nThe Maldives was the only country where the effects of the tsunami were felt across the \ncountry, rather than in certain parts or regions. It is among the worst-affected countries and will \nprobably  face  the  highest  per  capita  reconstruction  costs.  The  tsunami  has  severely  affected \nsuch  key  economic  sectors  as  tourism,  fisheries,  and  agriculture,  and  essential  infrastructure \nlike water supply, sanitation and power, the effects of which will spill over to other sectors. Given \nthe scale of the damage (estimated at 62% of 2004 GDP) and the fragile fiscal situation, even \nbefore the tsunami, considerable external assistance will be needed for the economy to recover. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Impact per Sector \n\nThe  negative  publicity  following  the  tsunami  has  led  to  a  steep  decline  in  tourism.  The \n8. \ndisaster occurred in the period of peak occupancy rates, well above 90% (for a total of 16,100 \noperational beds). The occupancy rate at the end of January 2005 was around 45% (for a total \nof 12,800 operational beds). \n \n9. \nTourism is expected to return to normal levels in the long run, as the chance of another \ntsunami  is  perceived  as  slight.  The  recovery  in  tourism  activity  will  also  depend  on  the  speed \nwith which the infrastructure (airports, jetties, hotels, harbours and roads) can be rehabilitated or \nreconstructed.  Repairs  to  some  resorts  may  take  up  to  1  year.  The  tourism  sector  is  likely  to \nexperience a 25% decline in 2005 relative to 2004. \n \n10. \nthe decline in tourism.  \n\nActivity in wholesale and retail trade, transport and communications will be affected by \n\n \n11. \nDamage  in  the  fisheries  sector  is  compounded  by  the  loss  of  harbors,  jetties,  and \nvessels. About 120 fishing vessels were completely destroyed and 50 more partially damaged. \nDamage to fish stocks and reefs was limited. No growth in fisheries is anticipated in 2005. \n \n12. \nAgricultural  crops  were  swept  away  and  most  agricultural  land  was  covered  with  salty \nmud,  leaving  it  temporarily  unusable.  As  a  result  of  the  destruction  (combined  with  lower \ndemand from resorts), the agriculture sector is likely to contract by about 5% in 2005. \n \n13. \nA number of sectors are, however, expected to experience higher growth as a result of \nreconstruction  in  the  wake  of  the  tsunami.  This  is  the  case  for  coral  and  sand  mining  and \nconstruction. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Growth \n\nThe combined impact of the tsunami will decelerate GDP growth substantially. Economic \n14. \ngrowth forecasts for 2005 have been revised downwards form the pre-tsunami estimate of 7.5% \nto 1%.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Financing \n\n15. \nThe  impact  of  the  tsunami  on  public  finances  is  likely  to  be  substantial.  The  effects \ninclude a reduction in revenues resulting from a lower tax base in combination with an increase \nin both current and capital expenditures.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\nOn the revenue side, government receipts from the tourism bed-night tax, and duties on \n16. \ntourism-related imports are likely to fall significantly. In addition, the government has decided to \nwaive import duties on all tsunami-related imports. Increased grant receipts mitigate some of the \ndecline in other government revenues. External grants in 2005 are expected to increase to 7.2% \nof GDP compared to the projected 1% pre-tsunami estimate.  \n \n17. \nOn  the  expenditure  side,  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  efforts  will  considerably \nincrease public expenditure. Government expenditure is expected to increase from 42% of GDP \nto 54%. The budget deficit (including grants) is expected to rise from a projected 4% of GDP to \n10.5% of GDP. The budget deficit, excluding grants, would amount to 17.8% of GDP. \n \n18. \nThese  figures  raise  concern  over  the  sustainability  of  the  deficit  and  how  it  will  be \nfinanced.  Given  the  limited  manoeuvring  space  for  the  government  as  a  result  of  continued \ndeficit  spending  in  the  recent  past,  there  is  a  danger  that  reconstruction  spending  will  be \nconstrained by a lack of financing. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Accounts \n\n19. \nThe  external  balance  is  also  expected  to  worsen,  the  contributing  factors  being  the \nslowdown  in  tourism,  and  an  increase  in  imports  necessary  for  reconstruction.  This  comes  in \naddition to an expected decrease in exports from the garments industry following the phase out \nof  the  Multi-Fiber  Arrangement.  However,  increases  in  both  official  transfers  and  remittances \nare  mitigating  factors.  Overall,  the  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  rise  sharply  to  about \n23%  of  GDP.  The  deficit  in  the  balance  of  payments  is  likely  to  be  about  $68  million  in  2005, \nafter adjustments for a substantial increase in expected external assistance. \n \n\n5. \n\nEmployment \n\nBefore the tsunami, tourism employed almost 40% of the labor force. So far most resorts \n20. \nhave  chosen  not  to  dismiss  any  workers,  who  continue  to  be  paid,  although  some  have  been \ntemporarily  reassigned  to  resorts  abroad.  Fisheries  accounted  for  another  11%  of  the  labor \nforce, and this sector has been badly affected by the loss of fishing vessels, equipment, and by \nthe erosion of agricultural lands. A number of small-scale programs that provide cash for work, \nsuch  as  brick-making,  have  been  begun  by  NGOs  to  provide  some  affected  people  with  a \ntemporary income. Quotas on the inflow of foreign workers have been temporarily lifted because \nof  the  need  for  labor  for  reconstruction.  Before  the  tsunami,  the  Government  had  started  the \ndevelopment of a retraining program for the unemployed and this may need to be implemented \nmore rapidly.  \n \nC. \n\nMitigating the Economic Downturn \n\nKey measures to mitigate the adverse macroeconomic impacts of the tsunami include: \n\n21. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIncome support to the affected population, for example as is being done through \ncash transfers. This also helps to maintain liquidity in the atolls. \nSupport for affected populations so they can restore their livelihoods by financing \nthe replacement of key assets and tools and employing local labor in rebuilding \ninfrastructure. \nEncouraging  a  resumption  in  tourism  activity  by  conveying  a  clear  message  to \nthe  rest  of  the  world  that  (a)  key  infrastructure,  like  the  airport,  is  safe  and \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n  Appendix 3 \n\n(iv) \n\nfunctioning  normally,  and  (b)  the  impact  of  the  tsunami  on  most  resorts  was \nminor and they are open for business.  \nEnsuring that the reconstruction effort is consistent with macroeconomic stability \nover  the  medium  term,  by  containing  the  fiscal  deficit,  adopting  an  appropriate \nexchange rate policy, and preserving price stability. \n\n \nD. \n\nFinancing Relief and Reconstruction \n\nSignificant external financing is needed, in the form of grants and concessional loans to \n22. \nthe  government,  as  well  as  higher  inflows  of  private  funds,  to  finance  the  budget  and  the \nwidening current account deficit of the balance of payments. External finance has been sought. \nAs of the end of February, total commitments of cash assistance amounted to $61.6 million from \nbilateral,  UN,  and  private  sources.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  $14  million  in  mixed  grants \nand credits and the IMF $6.3 million in emergency assistance. The Government of Japan has \ncommitted $20 million in grants. However, foreign financing received or pledged so far falls far \nshort of the estimated needs. \n \n23. \nIt  needs  to  be  emphasized  that  the  terms  on  which  external  finance  is  available  will \ndetermine the pace of reconstruction. Indeed, in undertaking additional external liability for post-\ntsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction, the Government will need to be particularly careful in \nnot running up external  debt stocks to uncomfortable levels, which could impact future growth \nprospects.  \n \n24. \nIn addition to the government, it is anticipated that the private sector will increase foreign \nborrowings, in order to finance bank liquidity and the reconstruction of resorts.

The  Government  of  the  Maldives  (the  Government)  has  set  up  a  Tsunami  Relief  and \nReconstruction  Fund  (TRRF)  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT).  The  TRRF \nwill manage all resources received from international and local sources in cash or in kind, and \nwill  channel  all  resources  to  programmed  relief  and  reconstruction  activities.  The  TRRF  will \noperate as a separate fund within the budget framework of the Government, and will enable the \nGovernment to transparently delineate and account for tsunami-related assistance and ensure \neffective  use  of  funds.  The  Government\u2019s  objectives  for  establishing  the  TRRF  are:  (i)  to \nsignificantly  reduce  the  risk  of  delays  in  the  availability  of  funds  at  the  operational  level;  (ii)  to \nenable  disbursement  of  funds  in  a  timely  manner  for  smooth  implementation;  (iii)  to  replenish \nthe account quickly to maintain program  momentum; and  (iv) to increase the speed, accuracy \nand transparency of reporting. The Government has requested that donors provide as much of \ntheir  funding  as  possible  through  the  TRRF  to:  (i)  assure  transparency  and  harmonization,  (ii) \neliminate duplication of efforts, and (iii) reduce administrative overheads. \n \nA needs assessment, recently completed for the Government by a joint team from World \n2. \nBank, ADB, and the UN, estimated the total public financing needs for reconstruction at about \n$304 million.  Of  this,  approximately  one  third  is  required  to  meet  immediate  reconstruction \nneeds  for  the  first  6  months.  The  remaining  is  required  to  meet  medium-term  reconstruction \nneeds\u2014from 6 months to 36 months. Total commitments reported by the Government as of  the \nend of February 2005 are around $61.6 million, of which $25.7 million has been received. The \nGovernment  anticipates  that  all  tsunami  reconstruction  assistance  will  be  managed  under  the \nTRRF.  Total  cash  and  in  kind  receipts  as  of  end  February  2005  amount  to  about  $68  million \n(about 62% in kind and 38% in cash).1 \n \n3. \nManagement Structure. The TRRF Board is appointed by the President and comprises \nseven  members:  three  senior  civil  servants  (including  the  Auditor  General  of  Maldives  as \nChairman),  three  representatives  from  the  private  sector,  and  one  representative  from \ninternational donor agencies. The Board will provide oversight and strategic advice to the fund. \nThe Board\u2019s functions include ensuring effective implementation of the relief and reconstruction \nwork;  monitoring  activities;  critically  reviewing  the  operational  reports,  including  expenditures; \nand promoting transparency in operations by ensuring broad dissemination of information on the \nutilization of funds.  \n \n \n4. \nStaffing. The day to day management of the fund would be entrusted to the MOFT. The \nTRRF  central  project  management  unit  (PMU)  team  will  initially  be  composed  of  regular  staff, \nadditional staff will be recruited as required. The financial management subteam will be headed \nby  the  Financial  Controller  and  will  consist  of  senior  staff  members  who  will  supervise  and/or \nundertake  accounting,  inventory  control,  and  audit  functions.  The  tender  and  procurement \nfunction  will  be  supported  by  the  tender  and  procurement  section,  MOFT.  Technical  support, \nfollow up and supervision will be provided by designated staff of the line ministries. \n \nFinancing Plan.  The  TRRF  team  is  in  the  process  of  committing  resources  to  specific \n5. \nsector  support  activities.  A  financing  plan  is  being  prepared  by  MOFT  that  will  match  funding \nagainst  sector  activities  in  which  reconstruction  financing  has  been  identified  as  needed.  The \n                                                 \n1  Separate  records  are  being  maintained  for  aid  received  in  kind.  The  inventory  of  supplies  received  and  supplies \nissued  is  being  periodically  updated.  Physical  and  administrative  controls  are  being  maintained  by  the  National \nSecurity  Service  (NSS).  The  NSS  has  been  mandated  to  monitor  and  control  the  movement  of  in  kind  aid  by \ncontrolling warehousing and transportation arrangements, and controls in place include intake registries, requisition \nslips, release slips, periodic inventory counts, and segregation of duties. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n  Appendix 5 \n\nfinancing  plan  will  be  dynamic  and  subject  to  bi-monthly  revisions  to  reflect  changes  to  donor \ncommitments as they are finalized, and the identification of new sources. The Government is in \nthe  process  of  developing  sector-specific  strategies  and  prioritized  investment  plans  for \nreconstruction  activities.  It  is  also  revising  its  budget  for  FY2005  to  include  TRRF  funds  and \nexpenditures.  TRRF  planning  and  budgeting  will  then  be  integrated  into  the  Government \nbudgetary process. \n \n6. \nFunds  Flow.  All  receipts  received  by  the  TRRF  will  be  deposited  to  a  designated \naccount for the TRRF (Account No. 1615) held at the Maldives Monetary Authority. Funds will \nbe deposited in two ways: (i) directly to account no. 1615; and (ii) transferred from two MOFT \nbank  accounts  at  the  Bank  of  Maldives  (account  No.  7701-147-900-001  for  rufiyaa  and  7701-\n147-900-002 for US dollars for donations received in cash, and donations from abroad. Funds \nfrom ADB (and other partner agencies) will be deposited into individual subaccounts of account \n1615  in  accordance  with  donor-specific  funding  requirements.  All  TRRF  expenditures  will  be \npaid  from  account  No.  1615.  For  donor-funded  activities  payments  will  be  made  from  the \nrespective subaccount within account 1615. \n \nOperations  Manual.  The  TRRF  operations  manual2  has  been  prepared  by  the \n7. \nGovernment  to  outline  guidelines  for:  (i)  activity/project  evaluation,  appraisal  and  approval,  (ii) \nflow of funds, (iii) accounting and financial reporting standards, and (iv) audit arrangements. It is \nbased upon existing government financial regulations, but significant attempts have been made \nby  the  Government  to  strengthen  the  financial  and  internal  controls  to  ensure  that  the  special \nneeds  of  the  TRRF  are  addressed.  While  the  TRRF  OM  provides  an  appropriate  framework, \nsome  sections  require  strengthening  and  further  details.  The  OM  has  been  reviewed  by  the \nWorld Bank and ADB, and recommendations by them are being incorporated. OM Version I will \nbe  made  effective  after  it  has  been  approved  by  the  MOFT  in  March  2005.  The  Government \nintends  OM  to  be  a  \u2018living  document\u2019  and  regular  updates  will  be  issued  to  reflect  additional \nrequirements  as  they  arise,  as  well  as  to  strengthen  internal  controls  as  a  result  of  audit \nrecommendations. \n \n8. \nAccounting. The Government is committed to ensuring that a TRRF accounting system, \ndeveloped in accordance with sound accounting principles, is established as soon as possible.3 \nTRRF accounts are to be maintained, and reports on physical and financial progress regularly \nprepared,  in  accordance  with  the  TRRF  OM.  An  off-the-shelf  accounting  software  package \n(Quickbooks)4 is in the process of being installed and programmed to meet TRRF requirements. \nIt is intended that the accounting system be implemented initially under a modified cash system \nand  on  a  double  entry  basis.  It  will  be  voucher-based,  and  computerized.  TRRF  accounting \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2  TRRF  Financial  Management  Policies,  Procedures,  and  Guidelines,  draft  dated  9  January  2005,  and  TRRF \n\nOperations Manual, draft dated 26 January 2005. \n\n3  The Government has already initiated a number of steps to strengthen its accounting system including as a result \nof dialogue with ADB linked to Loan 1915 (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Strengthening  of  the  Public  Accounting \nSystem Project. Manila). This process will continue and will be further accelerated once implementation of the loan \nbegins.  \n\n4   Implementation of Quickbooks is an interim measure until the full featured Government accounting system, that is \nanticipated  to  address  the  broad  spectrum  of  public  financial  management  and  treasury  requirements \n(macroeconomic forecasting, budget preparation and approval, budget execution, accounting, cash management, \ndebt management, revenue administration, auditing, as well as medium term fiscal and expenditure reporting, and \ngrant management), and possibly human resource management, procurement and contract management, project \nmanagement,  as  well  as  other  e-governance  applications,  is  installed  as  planned  with  ADB  support  under  Loan \n1915 (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nthe Republic of Maldives for the Strengthening of the Public Accounting System Project. Manila).  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n45 \n\npolicies  are  in  the  process  of  being  determined  and  will  be  explicitly  outlined  in  the  OM. \nStrengthening of the TRRF chart of accounts has been identified as a critical priority, which the \nGovernment has agreed to address. The Government has also indicated that material and fixed \nasset registries will be established and control processes developed and implemented.  \n \n9. \nFinancial  Reporting.  TRRF  reporting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  OM, \nand complemented by physical reporting and other documentation prepared by the Government \ndepartments involved in the supervision, implementation, and monitoring of TRRF projects and \nactivities.  TRRF  report  formats  will  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  they  meet  donor  requirements. \nHowever,  as  agreed  at  the  outset,  donors  are  expected  to  harmonize  and  coordinate \nrequirements. The frequency and type of reports will be outlined in the OM, and main formats \nannexed.  As  discussed  with  the  Government,  the  chart  of  accounts  and  reporting  formats  will \nhave to be structured to enable reports to be prepared for the TRRF as a whole, as well as by \nfinancing source, by sector (and possibly by subsector), by project, and by expenditure type.  \n \n10. \nAuditing. The TRRF audit strategy is targeted to ensure: (i) timely corrective actions by \nthe  TRRF  and  its  implementing  agencies,  and  (ii)  identification  of  recommendations  that  will \nsupport  improved  and/or  further  enhancement  of  accountability  and  transparency.  The  TRRF, \nas  per  the  Presidential  Decree,  is  required  to  be  audited  by  an  international  firm  of  chartered \naccountants, acceptable to ADB and other donors, under international standards of auditing to \nmaintain full transparency and to provide adequate assurance to all stakeholders. The audit firm \nwill  be  nominated  by  the  TRRF  Board,  and  contracted  upon  approval  of  stakeholders  in \naccordance  with  outline  terms  of  reference  to  be  annexed  to  the  OM.  External  audits  will  be \nundertaken  every  6  months  for  the  first  year  of  implementation  because  of  the  high  level  of \nexpected expenditure, and annually thereafter. \n \n11. \nIn addition to the external audit, the TRRF will be subject to a regular internal audit by an \ninternational firm of chartered accountants, approved by the Auditor General of the Maldives, to \nassess  whether  funds  have  been  disbursed  in  a  timely  way,  that  they  have  reached  intended \nrecipients,  that  transactional  controls  and  propriety  have  been  maintained,  and  all  TRRF \nresources  have  been  used  effectively  and  efficiently  for  the  intended  purposes.  Internal  audit \noutline terms of reference are to be annexed to the OM. The selection process for the internal \nauditors  has  begun  and  an  audit  will  begin  in  March  2005.    The  first  reports  are  expected  by \nmid-April 2005. The internal audit reports will be shared with ADB, upon request. \n \n12. \nPerformance audits will also be undertaken, based on an agreed upon project selection \nstrategy and selection criteria, so that representative coverage is achieved by financing source. \nThe  strategy  and  selection  criteria  for  implementing  the  performance  audits  and  the \nperformance audit outline terms of reference are to be annexed to the OM. \n \n13.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  A  central  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished under the National Economic Recovery and Reconstruction Program (NERRP). The \ncentral  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  consolidating  the  project  proposals  from  the  implementing \nagencies to be submitted for approval to the project coordination committee.5 The central PMU \nwill  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  bidding  documents  and  conducting  procurement  of  civil \nworks, equipment, goods and related services for reconstruction efforts; (ii) recommending the \n                                                 \n5  The  Project  Coordination  Committee  (PCC)  will  be  co-chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  Treasury  and  the \nMinister  of  Planning  and  National  Development  or  their  respective  designates,  and  will  include  high-level \nrepresentatives  from  MPND  and  the  implementing  agencies,  as  well  as  the  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family \nDevelopment and Social Security and Department of External Resources (DER).

This  has  resulted  in  deteriorating  living  conditions \non  many  inhabited  islands.  Impacts  resulting  from  the  absence  of  basic  infrastructure  and \nenvironmental services in the atolls was further exacerbated by the damage following the high \nwaves and flooding of the Indian Ocean tsunami which hit the Maldives on 26 December 2004, \nleading  in  some  cases  to  absolute  destruction  of  existing  infrastructure.  The  sector  was \nseriously  affected:  whilst  provision  of  water  supply  and  basic  sanitation  services  are  in  urgent \nneed of replacement, rehabilitation or reconstruction, the need to expedite adequate solid waste \nmanagement  practices  and  structuring  the  sector  for  efficient  operation  emerged  as  critical  to \ncope with damage and debris. \n \n2. \nWater supply in the atolls is almost entirely provided through a combination of rainwater \ntanks  (both  household  and  communal),  which  are  the  principal  source  of  drinking  water  and \ngroundwater  extraction  through  domestic  wells,  commonly  utilized  for  washing  and  bathing. \nDamages include loss of all water supplies, household and communal rainwater tanks, damage \nto roof water harvesting piping and gutter systems and well pumps. The extent of damage to the \nsanitation  and  sewerage  network  will  require  a  detailed  assessment  before  prioritization.  In \nextensively  affected  areas  a  significant  number  of  toilets  and  septic  tanks  need  replacing,  or \nwhen  the  structures  remain  undamaged  desludging  is  required,  whilst  small  bore  sewer  and \noutfall loss is estimated to be as large as 126 km and 2.4 km, respectively. The joint ADB, UN \nand World Bank Needs Assessment Mission estimated the recovery needs to be $45 million. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThis  component  will  rehabilitate  and  provide  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  services  for  the  69  most  affected  islands  communities.1 \nRehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  facilities  to  pre-tsunami  level  or  to  a  higher \ncost-effective environmentally-acceptable standard. The Project will be divided into two phases: \na short-term phase allowing the procurement of critical equipment, which will include immediate \nfunding for short term efforts, focusing on (i) providing immediate safe water to affected areas \nthrough  community  and  household  rainwater  tanks  and  rainwater  harvesting  equipment;  (ii) \nproviding  basic \nfacilities  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  sanitation \ninfrastructure,  including  the  provision  of  desludging  systems  and  sludge  drying  beds;  and  (iii) \nproviding  solid  waste  management  equipment  (including  communal  bins,  composters, \ncompactors, cutters, among others) and training for clearing and recovery of debris material. \n \n4. \nfocus  on  (i)  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of \nenvironmental infrastructure damaged by the tsunami (including sewage systems, networks and \noutfalls),  (ii)  provision  of  water  and  sewage  treatment  and  disposal  facilities  for  displaced \npopulation after the tsunami rendered their islands inhabitable; (iii) provision and development \nof  disaster  solid  waste  management  systems  and  facilities;  coupled  with  (iv)  community \n\nMedium-term  assistance  will \n\ntemporary  sanitation \n\nScope \n\n                                                 \n1  The  National  Disaster  Management  Center  of  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  reported  more  than  2,200  affected \n\nhouseholds in 69 most-affected islands, of which 36 highly or very highly affected islands.  \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n  Appendix 6 \n\nmobilization  and  organization  for  utilities  management,  operation  and  maintenance;  and  (v) \nprovision of institutional support and capacity building for environmental disaster management. 2 \n \n5. \nBy providing increased drinking water supplies, the Project will help protect the existing \nfreshwater  lens  from  over-extraction,  protect  public  health  from  potential  waterborne  diseases \nand the overall demands on the fragile aquifer will be reduced. The Project will also include the \ninstallation  of  appropriate  sanitation  solutions,  reducing  the  potential  contamination  of  the \ngroundwater.  Subproject  selection  and  design  will  consider  and  promote  community  project \nimplementation as well as management, operation and maintenance of the resulting schemes. It \nwill  encourage  participation  from  vulnerable  groups  and  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  in \nO&M of new schemes. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  project  component  of  EAP  will  finance  $4.0  million  for  short  and  medium  term \nimplementation  (Table  A6.1).

As there are no \nsignificantly large regional centers in the Maldives, transport between Mal\u00e9 and individual small \nisland  communities  dominates  domestic  maritime  freight  and  passenger  traffic.  In  this  regard, \nMal\u00e9-to-outer  islands  traffic  is  almost  entirely  import  cargo  transshipped  at  Mal\u00e9  Port.  Heavy \ncongestion prevails at the inter-atoll harbor in Mal\u00e9. Maritime transport services between Mal\u00e9 \nand  the  outer  islands,  and  within  and  between  the  outer  atolls,  are  inadequate  and  often \nunreliable.  Inter-atoll  and  inter-island  shipping  services  are  operated  entirely  by  the  private \nsector,  while  the  Government  provides  essential  infrastructure  such  as  ports  and  protected \nisland harbors, and regulatory functions like maritime safety administration. Aside from the main \nport  in  Mal\u00e9,  the  country  has  about  90  manmade  protected  island  harbors  with  quays,  basins \nand  breakwaters;  several  natural  harbors;  jetties  and  approach  channels  to  access  the  200 \ninhabited  islands.  However,  most  of  the  islands  are  lacking  proper  transport  infrastructure.  86 \nnos.  \u201c12-miles  light  beacons,\u201d  209  nos.  \u201c2-miles  reef  markers\u201d  and  390  \u201charbor  entrance \nmarkers\u201d mark the inter-atoll and inter-island shipping routes. \n \n3. \nsouthern and one in the northern atolls. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nWhile  the  26  December  Tsunami  inflicted  severe  physical  damage  to  housing,  power \nfacilities,  agriculture  and  fisheries,  the  damage  to  the  transport  infrastructure  was  less  in \ncomparison  than  originally  feared.  This  can  largely  be  attributed  to  the  facts  that  ports  and \nmaritime  facilities  are  generally  located  at  the  inner  side  of  the  atolls,  away  from  the  direct \ntsunami  impact  and  that  the  airports  are  located  on  islands  where  the  tsunami  had  limited \nimpact,  like  for  example  in  Mal\u00e9  and  Gan  islands  where  the  most  substantial  port  and  airport \ninfrastructure is located. \n \n5. \nIt  is  estimated  that  about  one  third  of  the  navigation  aids were  damaged  or  destroyed. \nAbout 36 jetties are reported to have some damage. About 4,200 m length of quay walls, and \n15,000  length  of  harbor/sea  walls  and  breakwaters  have  been  damaged  or  destroyed,  and \nabout  370,000  m3  of  dredging  will  be  required  to  remove  tsunami-inflicted  siltation  of  harbor \nbasis  and  approach  channels.  Five  causeways,  which  are  very  important  for  inter-island \nconnection, have been partly damaged.  \n \n6. \nThere  are  also  some  damages  to  Mal\u00e9  Commercial  Harbor  and  Mal\u00e9  International \nAirport, part of which will be covered by insurance. However, appropriate safety operation of the \nairport requires a short-term intervention. Tsunami-related damage in Mal\u00e9 International Airport \nincludes  airfield  area  and  drainage  works,  sea  wall  defenses,  navigation  equipment  and \ncommunications equipment. \n\nThe  airport  sector  consists  of  1  international  airport  and  3  regional  airports  in  the \n\nDamage and Impact of the Tsunami \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n  Appendix 7 \n\nProject Scope \n\nBased  on  the  figures  made  available  from  142  tsunami-affected  islands  and  after \n7. \ndiscussions  with  the  relevant  line  ministries,  the  Joint  WB-ADB-UN  System-JBIC  Assessment \nMission estimated the cost of reconstruction for the transport sector at $24.9 million. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThis  project  component  comprises:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  damaged  jetties,  (ii)  priority \nrepairs  on  sea  walls  and  quay  walls,  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  Mal\u00e9  International  Airport. \nAdditionally, the following emergency projects identified by the Joint Donor\u2019s needs Assessment \nMission  and  by  the  Government  for  immediate  implementation  should  be  covered  under  the \nquick  disbursing  component,  for  which  specific  assurances  should  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment: (i) rehabilitation/reinstatement of maritime navigation aids damaged or destroyed, \n(ii) procurement of emergency inter-island transportation capacity for reconstruction works, (iii) \npriority repairs in causeways, and (iv) priority dredging of harbor basis and approach channels. \nThe survey identified priorities and estimates for the rehabilitation cost. Rehabilitation works will \nbe  carried  out  to  restore  the  facilities  to  the  pre-tsunami  level  or  to  a  higher  standard  as \nconsidered cost-effective in the long run and, where appropriate, will include coastal protection \nmeasures to mitigate damage from future natural disasters. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe cost of restoration work is about $3.6 million equivalent. Under the proposed project, \nthe foreign exchange component comprises about $0.3 million.

STELCO \nis  currently  responsible  for  supplying  electricity  to  the  capital  island  of  Mal\u00e9  and  to  25  of  the \nlarger  outer  islands.  In  other  outer  islands,  the  electricity  is  being  supplied  by  the  Island \nDevelopment  Committees  (IDCs),  cooperatives,  NGOs  and  small  private  companies.  Each \nprovider  is  responsible  for  both  power  generation  and  distribution  to  the  households.  Diesel-\nbased generators are used to generate power in all islands. STELCO holds the largest share of \npower supply with a total installed generating capacity of 49 MW. The generating capacity of the \nelectricity providers in the outer islands is estimated at 16 MW; this excludes the power supply \nin  the  resort  islands,  which  is  being  taken  care  by  the  respective  private  resort  operators. \nDistribution  network  from  the  generators  comprises  mainly  underground  low  voltage  cables, \nexcept in Mal\u00e9 and a few large islands where high voltage cables are used. \n \n2. \nOn  26  December  2004,  a  tsunami  swept  many  islands  of  the  Maldives  resulting  in the \nworst disaster ever to hit the country. It totally disrupted the power supply system in at least 95 \nislands (about 48% of the total islands with electricity) and left the population without electricity \nfor days before the first technical team arrived to those islands to temporarily restore the electric \npower.  According  to  the  data  collected,  the  extent  of  damage  varied  from  island  to  island.  In \nalmost  all  affected  islands,  the  damage  occurred  to  the  distribution  network,  i.e.  cables, \ndistribution boxes, and household connections. The strong wave scoured the ground (which is \nmainly  sand),  pulled  out  the  cables  and  tore  them.  In  some  islands,  the  powerhouses, \ngenerators and switchboards were also damaged to a varying degree; some of the generators \ncan  be  repaired  and  others  have  to  be  replaced.  Streetlights  in  a  few  islands  were  also \ndamaged. \n \n3. \nThe  damage  included  24  power-houses,  104  generators  capacities  ranging  from  20  to \n150  kilowatts  (kW),  34  switchboards,  more  than  121  km  of  cables  of  various  sizes,  632 \ndistribution  boxes,  and  652  street  lights.  The  World  Bank\u2013ADB\u2013UN  System  Joint  Needs \nAssessment Report estimated the recovery needs to be $4.6 million. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  component  comprises  rehabilitation  of  tsunami-damaged  power  supply \n4. \nsystem.  This  part  of  the  Project  will  cover  (i)  supply  and  installation  of  new  generators, \nswitchboards,  distribution  network,  and  streetlights;  (ii)  construction  of  powerhouses;  and  (iii) \nconnection  to  consumers.  Rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  the  facility  to  the \npre-tsunami level or to a higher standard as considered cost-effective in the long run. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nProject Scope \n\nThe  cost  of  immediate  and  short-term  restoration  work  is  about  $1.0  million,  which  the \n5. \nGovernment can finance under quick disbursing component of the Project, while the remaining \n$3.1  million  will  be  financed  under  the  project  component  by  ADB  and  the  Government.  The \nforeign  exchange  component  comprises  about  $1.5  million  or  48%  of  the  total  cost,  while  the \ntotal local currency cost is $1.6 million equivalent or 52% of the total costs, including local taxes \nand duties.

These  damage  assessments  and  cost  estimates  cover  repair  and/or \nreplacement  of  fishing  vessels,  engines,  fishing  gear  and  accessories,  fish  processing \nequipment and infrastructure. Each atoll office has assessed the tsunami damage and reported \nto  MFAMR.  While  there  is  a  need  for  a  more  detailed  survey  to  ascertain  the  atoll  office \nassessment and verify the cost estimates, there is general agreement that the broad extent of \ndamages to fishing vessels and fish processing facilities need immediate repair. The details of \ndamage and social implications are as follows:  \n \n\nTable A9.1: Damage Assessment in the Fisheries Sector \n\n \nUnit \n \n\nTotal Damage to Infrastructure \n\nDamage to \nInfrastructurea \nPart \nFull \n50 \n120 \n0 \n374 \n5 \n0 \n2 \n8 \n\n \nNo. \n \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n\n \nType of Facility \n \nFishing vessels  \nFish processorsc  \nReef fisheryd \nInfrastructuree \nBusiness lossf \n\n \nTotal \n\nNo. \nNo. \nNo. \nNo. \n\n($ million)b \n11.52 \n1.39 \n0.15 \n0.12 \n11.92 \n25.10 \n\n(Rf million) \n147.50 \n17.80 \n1.88 \n1.55 \n152.57 \n321.32 \na  Damage estimate is based on MFARM\u2019s revised estimate, received on 2 February 2005. \nb  $1.0 = Rf12.80 \nc    Three-hundred thirty-seven cottage fish processors and 37 commercial processors lost equipment and materials. \nd   Reef fishery damages include lost equipment and materials of the harvesting fleet and ocean cages.  \ne  Infrastructure includes fully damaged 8 boatsheds, Mariculture Research Station, and FAD center. \nf   Direct income losses from fishing and other businesses estimated here. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2. \nThe 2004 tsunami had other adverse social impacts on the fishing communities. As they \nrarely  saved  in  banks  but  kept  their  savings  at  home,  fishermen  lost  their  savings  when  the \ntsunami hit their homes. Affected fishing communities who took loans from financial institutions \nare  unable  to  repay  their  loans  as  they  have  lost  their  means  of  livelihood.  Without  fishing \nvessels,  they  cannot  catch  fish  during  the  peak  fishing  season  from  January  to  April,  nor  can \nsmall-scale  cottage  processors  produce  Maldives  fish  during  this  period.  The  Government  of \nJapan  is  initiating  efforts  to  address  the  needs  of  those  fishing  communities  who  lost  their \nvessels while it is proposed that ADB assist fish processors.  \n \nB. \n \nThe objective of the Project is to restore the livelihood of fish processors affected by the \n3. \ntsunami,  who  have  no  other  source  of  assistance,  and  to  strengthen  their  resilience  to  future \ndisasters and ensure their sustainable development.  \n \n \n \n \n\nObjective \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n  Appendix 9 \n\nScope \n\nC. \n \n4. \nFish processors need immediate assistance in order to restore their livelihoods lost due \nto  the  tsunami.  The  Project  aims  to  enable  fish  processors  to  restart  their  fish  processing \nactivities  by  providing  them  with  tools  and  equipment,  in-kind  contribution  and  working  capital \nthrough  community-based  organizations  (CBO)  or  island  development  committees  (IDC),  as \nappropriate. The Project will also provide extension and support services to help fish processors \nrestore  and  diversify  their  livelihood  through  development  of  new  skills  and  adoption  of  more \nefficient processing techniques and production diversification.   \n \n5. \nIt  is  estimated  that  to  restart  their  businesses,  a  cottage  fish  processor  needs  basic \ninputs and equipment worth about Rf20,000 and medium processors need about Rf80,000. As \nwell, working capital of up to Rf10,000 per fish processor is needed for operations and will be \nprovided through CBOs or IDCs. The MFAMR will provide CBO or IDC with the total amount of \nworking  capital  fund  required  by  each  island,  which  the  CBO  will  distribute  to  the  fish \nprocessors.  \n \n6. \nMFAMR will prepare guidelines for CBO/IDC operations relevant to the assistance. The \nMFAMR  will  evaluate  and  select,  in  conjunction  with  project  beneficiaries,  the  most  suitable \nCBOs or IDCs to deliver the project inputs. The MFAMR will deposit the required amount to a \nCBO\u2019s/IDC\u2019s account in 89 affected islands based on an agreement to be signed with the PMU. \nCBO\u2019s  will  be  paid  2%  to  4%  of  the  total  working  capital  fund.  The  MFAMR  will  monitor \nperformance of the CBOs, who will in turn monitor performance of individual beneficiaries. The \nProject  will  require  that  the  CBOs  register  as  cooperatives  after  the  Cooperative\u2019s  Act  is \npassed.1  \n \n7. \nIn order to ensure the effective use of the grant, the Project will provide technical support \nand extension services to fish processors and strengthen the institutional capacity of MFAMR. \nMFAMR will provide fish processors with training in community mobilization and management.  \n \nD. \n \nMFAMR has identified fish processors in 89 islands under the fisheries component of the \n8. \nProject and prepared estimates of rehabilitation costs.2 On the basis of these estimates and field \nvisits,  the  Fact-finding  Mission  of  the  Project  and  MFAMR  appraised  the  affected  islands  and \nprepared the following selection criteria for the Project: \n \n\nSelection Criteria \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nfish processors suffering from losses during the 2004 tsunami; and, \nno overlap of assistance from donors for beneficiaries under the Project. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe  total  component  cost  is  estimated  at  $3.2  million,  including  about  $1.8  million  in \nforeign exchange and $1.4 million equivalent in local currency.

The  Project  will  be \ncoordinated and monitored through the NERRP of MOFT, of which, MFAMR is a member. The \nImplementing  Agency  will  be  MFAMR.  The  Fisheries  Development  and  Extension  Services  of \nMFAMR will be the Project Implementation Agency (IA) and will report to the Assistant Director \nGeneral,  Fisheries  and  Marine  Resources  Directorate  who  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \ncoordinating and monitoring Project activities. The IA will work closely with CBOs/IDCs who will \nimplement the Project in the affected islands.   \n \n12. \nAs  the  Project  aims  to  involve  and  empower  island  communities  in  regard  to  the \nmanagement  of  their  economic  activities,  MFAMR  will  select  existing  CBO  or  IDC  in  close \nparticipation  with  prospective  beneficiaries,  to  assist  the  fish  processors  in  restoring  their \nlivelihood and improving their marketing activities. The MFAMR will provide training for CBOs on \nbasic accounting (auditing, book keeping, etc), marketing, monitoring and evaluation.  A project \nconsultant  will  assist  CBOs  to  graduate  into  commercially  operating  cooperatives,  as  soon  as \nthe cooperative act has been passed into law. By giving the responsibility of managing the funds \nto the communities, a sense of ownership for the Project is fostered. Funds will be retained for \nuse  in  the  specific  communities  for  a  range  of  economic  activities  to  ensure  their  sustained \ndevelopment.  \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n  Appendix 9 \n\n13.  MFAMR  will  identify  the  tsunami-affected  cottage  processors  and  medium  commercial \nprocessors affected by the 2004 tsunami. Based on the direct reports of island and atoll offices, \nMFAMR will verify the affected processors through field visits. Verification is ongoing and so far \n7  worst  affected  atolls  out  of  20  have  been  completed.  The  affected  fish  processors  will  be \nprovided with equipment and utensils through CBOs/IDCs in each island. The CBO/IDC will (i) \ncreate awareness among the island community about the Project, (iii) report to MFAMR on the \nrequirements  of  affected  communities,  (iv)  distribute  inputs  and  tools  to  individual  processors \nselected under the Project, (v) provide working capital grants to individual fish processors, and \n(vi)  maintain  and  manage  a  separate  account  for  the  Project  with  the  regional  branch  of  the \nBank of Maldives. Equipment and utensils for project beneficiaries will be procured centrally by \nthe NERRP. \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  MFAMR  to  provide  technical \n14. \nsupport and extension services to the affected fish processors. This component of  the Project \nincludes (i) services of an international fisheries marketing specialist for a period of 1 month and \nan  international  community  development  specialist  for  2  months,  (ii)  services  of  a  domestic \ncommunity  development  specialist  for  24  months  and  a  domestic  extension  officer  for  12 \nmonths, (iii) provide funds for the operation of 3 mobile extension service teams for a period of \n24  months,  (iv)  purchase  of  equipment  for  delivery  of  training;  and  (v)  short  term  overseas \ntraining of extension officers. \n \n15. \nThe  fisheries  component  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  2  years.  Most  of  grant \nactivities are expected to start in April 2005 and be completed by December 2005; but the fish \nprocessing extension activities will be completed by March 2007. \n \n16. \nThe  NERRP  will  monitor  overall  progress  of  project  implementation  and  provide \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  to  indicate  the  progress  made  and  problems  encountered \nduring  the  period  under  review,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  the \nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  the  expected  progress  during  the  following  quarter.  The \nCBO  will  report  to  the  MFAMR  on  its  activities,  including  all  its  procurements,  disbursements \nand repayments. The MFAMR will provide training courses to the CBOs. The MFAMR will also \nevaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  scheme  on  a  regular  basis  and  conduct  site  visits  and \nconsultation with beneficiary communities. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n61 \n\nAGRICULTURE SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ASSISTANCE  \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nAgriculture  sector  was  badly  hit,  as  the  basic  natural  resources  of  agriculture  (soil  and \n1. \nwater)  are  affected  by  the  tsunami  waves  causing  temporary,  semi-permanent  or  even \npermanent  damage  to  these  resources.  Destruction  to  home  gardens,  standing  crops,  arable \nland and groundwater, loss of farming equipment and damage to agriculture infrastructure are \nsubstantial. The related decline in production and yield levels of field and other crops, including \nhomestead cultivation such as breadfruit, mango and other fruit trees, is significant. Table A10.1 \nprovides extent of damage to agricultural islands. \n \nThe Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture, and Marine Resources (MFAMR) has identified 68 \n2. \nislands where field crop was affected by the tsunami, and 115 islands where perennials and fruit \ntrees were affected and need to restore them to their condition prior to the tsunami. \n \nFood  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  is  processing  emergency \n3. \nassistance  addressing  less  seriously  affected  perennials  in  42  islands,  while  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction assistance is being processed to address farmers in 26 most affected islands \nengaged  in  field  crops.

It aims also to assist affected farm families to diversify and adopt improved farming \ntechnology to ensure sustainability. \n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n  Appendix 10 \n\nScope \n\nC. \n \n5. \nThe Project will provide farm inputs (seeds and fertilizers), tools and equipment lost due \nto  the  disaster.  It  will  also  provide  working  capital  and  support  extension  services  to  help \naffected farmers. The tsunami-affected farmers, who lost annual crops, perennial crops and fruit \ntrees, need basic inputs and equipment with up to Rf20,000. They will receive working capital as \nmicrocredit  to  prepare  with  planting  their  crops,  which  will  be  equivalent  to  15%  of  the  inputs \nand equipment.    \n \n6. \nIn order to ensure the effective use of working capital, MFAMR will evaluate and select, \nin  conjunction  with  project  beneficiaries,  the  most  suitable  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs)  or  Island  Development  Centers  (IDCs)  to  deliver  the  project  inputs.  The  MFAMR  will \ndeposit  the  required  amount  to  a  CBO\u2019s/IDC\u2019s  account  based  on  a  credit  agreement  to  be \nsigned with the project (PIU).1 CBO\u2019s will be paid 2% to 4% of the total working capital fund as \nadministration fee. The MFAMR will monitor performance of the CBOs, who will in turn monitor \nperformance of individual processors/borrowers. The Project will require that the CBOs register \nas cooperatives as soon as the legal framework of Cooperatives is passed.2 \n  \n7. \nMFAMR will provide extension services to farmers through the services of three mobile \nextension  service  teams,  and  strengthen  its  institutional  capacity  with  the  services  of  an \nagronomist  and  a  community  development  specialist.  The  extension  services  will  identify  the \ncontaminated  soil  and  groundwater  conditions  in  the  islands  and  provide  suitable  cultivation \nmethods  to  cope  with  the  problem  facing  the  farmers.  The  Project  will  provide  CBO/IDC  with \ntraining in community mobilization and management and micro-finance operations.  \n \nD. \n \nMFARM has identified 115 islands in 11 atolls3 under the agriculture component of the \n8. \nProject and prepared estimates of rehabilitation costs.

At the field level, responsibility for \nimplementing the Project will rest with the regional development management offices and atoll \noffices and CBO/IDC.  \n \n12. \nThe agriculture component will be implemented over a period of 2 years. Most of grant \nactivities  are  expected  to  start  in  April  2005  and  be  completed  by  December  2005;  but  the \nagriculture extension activities will be completed by March 2007. \n \n13.  MFARM will identify the tsunami-affected farmers in 42 less severely affected islands for \nfield  crops  and  26  severely  affected  islands  for  perennial  crops  and  fruit  trees.  Based  on  the \nNational  Disaster  Management  Center\u2019s  information,  MFAMR  will  verify  the  affected  farmers \nthrough  field  visits.  The  affected  farmers  will  be  provided  with  agriculture  inputs,  including \nseeds, fertilizers, tools and equipment through existing organizations or newly created CBO in \neach  island.  The  CBO  will  (i)  create  awareness  and  inform  the  island  community  about  the \nProject,  (iii)  report  to  MFAMR  on  its  requirements,  (iv)  distribute  inputs  and  tools  to  individual \nfarmers,  (v)  distribute  grants  to  individual  farmers,  and  (vi)  maintain  and  manage  a  separate \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n  Appendix 10 \n\naccount  for  the  Project.  The  NERRP  will  procure  centrally  agriculture  inputs,  tools,  and \nequipment. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  MFAMR  to  provide  technical \nsupport  and  extension  services  to  the  affected  communities.  This  component  of  the  Project \nincludes  (i)  services  of  an  international  agronomist  for  a  period  of  6  months;  (ii)  services  of  a \ndomestic  community  development  specialist  for  a  period  of  12  months;  and  (iii)  funds  for  the \noperation of 3 mobile extension service teams for a period of 24 months. \n \n15. \nThe  NERRP  will  monitor  overall  progress  of  project  implementation,  and  provide \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  to  indicate  the  progress  made  and  problems  encountered \nduring  the  period  under  review,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  the \nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  the  expected  progress  during  the  following  quarter.  The \nCBO  will  report  to  the  MFAMR  on  its  activities,  including  all  its  procurements,  disbursements \nand repayments. The MFAMR will offer advice  and assistance to the  CBOs, and  evaluate the \neffectiveness  of  the  scheme  on  a  regular  basis  through  site  visits  and  consultations  with \nbeneficiary communities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n65 \n\nCOST ESTIMATES \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\ni.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Maldives: \nThe  Tsunami  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (the  Project)  is  a  grant  and  loan  assistance  that  consists  of  two \ncomponents:  (i)  $6.5  million  for  quick  disbursement  assistance;  and  (ii)  prompt  restoration  and  reconstruction  of \ntsunami-related damages in five sectors\u2014water supply, sanitation and solid waste management; transport; power; \nagriculture;  and  fisheries.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  increased  risk  of  poverty  by  helping  affected  people  reduce \ntheir vulnerability to the tsunami-related shocks (i.e., unclean environment and related illnesses, damaged maritime \nand  air  infrastructure  limiting  safe  travel,  damaged  public  utilities  and  discontinued  power  supply,  and  destroyed \nlivelihoods).  Poor  and  disadvantaged  households,  especially  female-headed  households,  are  more  vulnerable  to \nthese shocks and face a greater risk of becoming further marginalized. ADB\u2019s medium and long-term post-tsunami \nassistance will be adjusted to support Government priority to be envisaged in the planned 7th National Development \nPlan (2006\u20132010). The next Maldives Country Strategy and Program (CSP), scheduled for 2006, will consider the \nnew 7th National Development Plan and Government\u2019s post-tsunami strategy. \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nThe  Maldives  has  experienced  rapid  economic  growth  over  the  past  25  years.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \nmaintained  an  average  annual  growth  of  about  9%  per  year  primarily  due  to  the  development  and  expansion  of \ntourism, fisheries, and service industry. However, geographical challenges have led to unbalanced economic growth \nand  poverty  in  the  country.  With  a  population  of  about  300  thousand  people,  the  Maldives  is  an  archipelago  that \nconsists  of  about  1,192  islands  spread  across  860  km.  Regional  disparities  can  be  seen  in  terms  of  absolute \npoverty, and social and physical development. An estimated 70% of the population outside of Mal\u00e9 has an income \nequivalent to the bottom 20% in Mal\u00e9 (VPA 1998). The cost of providing infrastructure and quality services remains \nhigh  and  ineffective  due  to  a  dispersed  population  and  the  remoteness  of  some  islands.  Global  warming  also \nthreatens  many  islands  in  the  Maldives,  as  most  are  located  just  above  sea  level.  A  lack  of  infrastructure,  social \nservices, and rising sea levels fuels migration to Mal\u00e9.  \n \nPre-tsunami,  absolute  poverty  under  the  poverty  line  of  Rf15  per  person  per  day  decreased  from  43%  in  1997  to \nabout 22% in 2004, based on preliminary results of the Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment (VPA) 2004 data.1 As \na result of the Tsunami on 26 December 2004, absolute poverty is likely to increase the number of poor below the \npoverty  line  of  Rf15  per  person  per  day.  The  Tsunami  significantly  damaged  about  39  islands,  of  which  about  14 \nislands  were completely destroyed. About 100 thousand of the population was severely affected. About 7% of the \npopulation has been displaced\u2014close to 12,000 people have been displaced from their islands, and another 8,500 \npeople are temporarily relocated to other places on their own island. The Ministry of Gender, Family Development, \nand Social Security is providing emergency cash payments of Rf1,500, Rf1,000 and Rf500 per person based on the \nlevel of damage caused by the tsunami on housing structure. Public infrastructure and services were damaged and \ndisrupted (i.e., ports and harbors, power supply, and water supply). Livelihoods and service jobs were also affected, \nas  many  rely  on  tourism  and  fishing  industries.  For  instance,  about  18%  of  the  total  labor  force  is  engaged  in \nprimary  fishing  activities,  but  almost  98%  of  employment  in  the  fisheries  sector  is  found  in  the  atolls  (VPA  1998). \nDamaged  infrastructure  systems  pose  serious  environmental  and  health  risks  and  inhibit  social  and  economic \ndevelopment of individuals living in 20 administrative atolls. The estimated cost of tsunami-related damages is about \n$470 million (about 60% of the GDP), of which about $298 million are for direct damages.  \n \nThe Project will help restore access to public infrastructure and services. It will help maintain clean living conditions \nthrough  community-based  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management  programs.  The  Project  will  also \nhelp  re-establish  lost  agricultural  and  fishing  incomes  through  livelihood  programs  targeted  at  agricultural  and \nfishing  individuals.  Interventions  proposed  within  each  sector  will  help  restore  the  livelihoods  of  many  tsunami-\naffected  and  internally  displaced  people.  By  reducing  the  risk  of  vulnerability,  the  Project  will  also  help  to  restore \nconfidence levels and self-dignity of people and communities adversely affected by the tsunami. \n\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA stakeholder analysis was done to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and the ways in \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Planning and National Development. 1998. Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment (VPA). Mal\u00e8. Based \non  the  VPA  (1998),  income  poverty  is  illustrated  using  3  poverty  lines:  15%  of  the  population  live  below  Rf7.5 \n($0.59)  poverty  line,  22%  below  Rf10  ($0.78),  and  43%  below  Rf15  ($1.17).  The  VPA  2004  data  has  been \ncompleted but has not yet been published. \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\nwhich  they  affect  project  feasibility  and  success.  Primary  stakeholders  include:  tsunami-affected  people  (i.e., \nwomen,  vulnerable  groups,  water  users,  home  agricultural  and  fishing  communities);  non-affected  island  and  atoll \nresidents;  and  tourists.  Secondary  stakeholders  include:  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT);  Ministry  of \nPlanning and National Development; Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Environment and Construction in the water \nsupply, sanitation and solid waste management sector; Ministry of Communication (MOC) and Ministry of Transport \nand Civil Aviation (MTCA) in transport sector; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Marine Resources (MAFMR) in \nagriculture and fisheries sectors; State Electricity Company Limited in power sector; Ministry of Atolls Development \n(MOAD); Ministry of Gender, Family Development and Social Security; and civil society,2 including nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), community groups, and development committees at all administrative levels. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA  participation  strategy  is  integrated  into  the  overall  Project  design.  MOFT  will  coordinate  with  various  Ministries \nduring  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  sector-like  approach,  covering  five  key  sectors\u2014water \nsupply,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management;  transport;  agriculture;  fisheries;  and  power.3  Administrative \nplanning  will  be  centralized,  while  implementation  will  consider  views  of  different  stakeholder.  Atoll,  island,  and \nwomen\u2019s committees  will participate during project design to help maximize project benefits for their communities, \nespecially vulnerable groups. Procedures for subproject selection are outlined in Appendix 12. As specified as part \nof  the  subproject  proposal  selection  criteria,  beneficiaries  will  be  consulted  and  their  views  incorporated  into  the \nselection  process  of  subprojects.  Each  sector  includes  details  of  how  different  stakeholders  will  participate  during \nproject implementation, operation, and maintenance, thereby fostering ownership and social cohesion. Participatory \napproaches will be used in designing subprojects, implementation, operation and maintenance, and monitoring and \nevaluation  arrangements.  The  process  will  involve  information  sharing,  consultations,  interviews,  focus  group \nmeetings,  and  collaborative  decision-making.  The  Project  builds  on  the  strong  social  capital  demonstrated  during \nthe  immediate  aftermath  of  the  tsunami  by  encouraging  partnerships  with  community  groups,  island  communities, \nand other stakeholders. The summary initial environmental examination (Appendix 17) and resettlement framework \n(Appendix 18) also include participatory actions. An international community development specialist will be engaged \nfor 1 person-month, and a national social and gender specialist for 6 person-months to help support and coordinate \nparticipatory activities of communities across all sectors during project implementation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nMalidivian  women  make  up  close  to  49%  of  the  total  population,  and  close  to  52%  of  the  tsunami-affected \npopulation in 20 atolls. Female-headed households make up about 46% of the total number of households due to \nmarital status, or absentee husband that migrated for work and/or were absent at the time of the census. There are \nno visible gender disparities in the provision of basic health care and education. Over the last 30 years, literacy rate \nof  females  aged  15  and  above  reached  97%.  Maternal  mortality  rate  per  100,000  live  births  reduced  from  480  in \n1990 to 75 in 2000. However, gender disparities are found in some areas such as levels of nutritional intake, school \nperformance  and  educational  attainment  levels.  For  example,  anemia  affects  about  51%  of  the  female  population \nand indirectly contributes to maternal mortality. \n \nWomen play important roles in economic activities, and are responsible for a variety of domestic tasks. They often \nengage in home gardening of agricultural products (i.e., curry leaves, fruits, and vegetables), and in fish processing. \nThese items may be kept for home-use, given to others free of charge, or sold to a middleman for sale in another \nisland  market.  Women  also  hold  government  positions,  with  some  representation  at  high  levels:  two  women  are \nmembers of the cabinet (i.e., Ministry of Health and Ministry of Gender, Family Development and Social Security), \nand  one  is  an  atoll  leader.  A  gender  policy  for  the  Maldives  has  been  formulated  and  is  in  the  process  of  being \napproved. Women also participate in community affairs and in the island\u2019s women\u2019s committee.  \n \nAbout 4% of all employees in tourism are women. A shift to a service-oriented economy has caused more women to \nenter  the  labor  work  force.  According  the  World  Bank-ADB-UN  systems  joint  needs  assessment,  labor  force \nparticipation rate (LFPR) for women rose by 9% from 1995 to 2000. Even  with this increase there is considerable \ngender disparity in LFPR with male comprising 71.1% and females 37.4% (2000). The VPA 2004 data indicates a \nrise in unemployment rate since 1997 for both men and women, indicating an increase in the number of both willing \nto  work.  About  28%  of  the  female  labor  force  is  unemployed  in  the  atolls,  compared  to  14%  in  Mal\u00e9  (VPA  2004 \ndata). About 9% of the male labor force in the atolls are unemployed, compared to the 7% in Mal\u00e9.  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n2 In the aftermath of the tsunami, the NGO sector formed an NGO forum that consists of about 12 NGOs. The forum \nwas formed for better communication, coordination of emergency response, and building on one another\u2019s skills.  \n3 The World Bank and the UN system are providing emergency assistance to the education and health sectors. Other \n\nbilateral donors and NGOs are also providing assistance to these sectors and other sectors in the Maldives. \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\nDuring post-tsunami reconstruction, the involvement of women is essential in order to prevent any adverse affects \non their daily lives. Those holding government jobs remain unaffected, but for others, salinity of home gardens and \ndamage to fish processing equipment has made it difficult for women to continue their livelihoods activities. Because \nmen\u2019s work is more visible, there is a danger that asset replacement during the recovery phase could ignore those \nassets essential to women\u2019s income income-generating activities at home (i.e., sewing or catering). Men have been \nable to continue fishing activities, as damage to vessels was not severe.  \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  benefit  women  equally,  to  provide  women  with  equal  opportunities  and  pay  for \nemployment, and to support women\u2019s participation during project implementation. A number of rainwater tanks were \naffected  by  the  tsunami,  thereby  affecting  the  quality  of  water  for  households.  Unclean  water  and  poor  sanitary \nconditions following the tsunami could adversely impact the health status of women and families. The reconstruction \nof  power  and  maritime  infrastructure  (i.e.,  restoration  of  electricity  and  seawalls)  will  restore  the  labor  saving \ntechnologies through power supply and livelihoods for those who engage in fisheries. Infrastructure improvements \nwill protect fishing vessels, and restore access to markets, extension social services, and information. Repair of air \ninfrastructure will improve airport safety, which would help support the tourism industry. It will support cash-for-work, \nwhere priority for unskilled labor generated by the Project will be given to those affected by the tsunami. Women will \nhave  equal  access  to  job  opportunities  and  equal  pay.  Such  short-term  employment  will  be  important  for  women \nwho find it difficult to reestablish their livelihoods  while living in temporary shelters. All  sectors have taken gender \ninto consideration so to avoid exacerbating disparities during post-tsunami reconstruction.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \nE.

The  Project  will  focus  on  the \nrehabilitation  of  existing  facilities,  so  some  minor  LAR  impacts \nresettlement \ncould  be  expected  during  construction.  A \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  LAR  assessment  and \ndevelop appropriate mitigation measures at implementation.  \nThe  Project  will  help  restore  communications  and  access  to \nbasic  infrastructure  and  services  for  communities  affected  by \nthe  tsunami.  The  refurbishment  of  transport  and  power  supply \nfacilities  will  restore  access  to  markets,  including  affordable \ngoods and services. \nNo  adverse  impact  on  labor  is  anticipated.  The  Project  is \nexpected  to  create  skilled  and  unskilled  jobs  for  communities \nduring  construction,  operation  and  maintenance.  It  will  benefit \nthose  who  lost  their  primary  source  of  livelihoods  based  on \nagriculture, tourism and fisheries. Priority for unskilled labor will \nbe  given  to  tsunami-affected  people.  The  Project  will  provide \nwomen with equal access to jobs and pay.  \nThere are no indigenous populations living in the Maldives. \n\nThe  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  the  Maldives  is  not  significant, \nand  the  increased  risk  to  HIV/AIDS  due  to  the  Project  is \nminimal.  The  Project  will  help  keep  risks  low  by  coordinating \nwith  (i)  appropriate  line  ministries  and  civil  society  groups  on \nongoing  HIV/AIDS  awareness  efforts,  and  (ii)  contractors  to \ndisseminate HIV/AIDS information among their staff and labor. \nPart of the Government\u2019s long-term strategy is to develop \u201csafe\u201d \nislands to (i) serve as growth centers for obtaining economies of \nscale  in  delivering  services,  and  (ii)  help  reduce  poverty  and \nlessen regional disparities. However, this strategy could require \nthe voluntary relocation of tsunami-affected population from less \ninhabited  islands  that  may  not  be  ready  for  relocation.

The  Project \nwill  follow  a  sector  approach  to  facilitate  selection  of  the  highest  priority  subprojects  during \nimplementation.  The  present  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reviews  the  potential \ndegree  of  likely  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  proposed  interventions  and  describes \npossible  mitigation  measures  for  the  Project.  Subprojects  site  selection,  detailed  design  and \nspecific  construction  and  operation activities  will  be  determined  during project  implementation. \nEnvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  were  prepared  to  guide  subproject \nenvironmental  screening  and  environmental  compliance  with  requirements  prescribed  in  the \nGovernment of the Maldives legal framework and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Environmental \nPolicy (2002)1 and guidelines (2003).2 \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  economic  growth  recovery  from  the  tsunami  devastating \nimpact through (i) rehabilitating basic infrastructure and services in the islands, and (ii) restoring \neconomic  activity  in  affected  areas.  Because  of  emergency  requirements,  the  Project  will  not \nfollow  conventional  ADB  requirements  leading  to  the  preparation  of  sample  subproject  IEEs. \nThe Project\u2019s IEE provides overall preliminary scooping, highlighting potential key environmental \nissues to be further explored during subproject formulation.

The islands stretch over a distance of 860 \nkilometers (km) north to south, and 130 km east to west. The average area of the 199 inhabited \nislands  is  57.8  hectares  (ha)  and  only  3  islands  exceed  an  area  of  400  ha.  The  maximum \nelevation is below 3 meters (m) above mean sea level and most (80%) of the land is less than \n1m above mean high tide level. Thirteen of the atolls lie within the three Central Regions. Inside \nthe  atolls,  water  depth  is  generally  less  than  80  m.  The  islands  comprise  layers  of \nunconsolidated  shell  and  coral  sand  and  debris,  lying  on  coral  rock,  which  are  normally  less \nthan 10 m below the surface. Soils are thin (20 centimeters or less) freely draining and highly \nalkaline.  There  is  abundant  calcium,  magnesium,  and  phosphorus;  and  sufficient  iron.  The \ntropical  climate  is  dominated  by  two  monsoon  periods.  Temperature  ranges  between  25-30 \ndegrees Celsius, and rainfall is about 2000 millimeters per annum. Water on the islands occurs \nalmost entirely as groundwater within the aquifer that overlies the coral rock. \n \n \n \nThe  Maldives  displays  a  pristine  marine  environment.  The  well  being  of  the  coral  reef, \n4. \nthe  7th  largest  in  the  world  covering  a  total  area  of  8,920  km2  and  contributing  to  5%  of  the \nworld\u2019s reef area, is of concern at national and international levels. Marine biological diversity is \nexceptional  and  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  world\u2019s  richest  ecosystems.  Most  recent \naccounts recognize 187 species of stony coral, 1,090 species of fish, and almost 300 species of \nmarine  algae,  36  species  of  sponges,  little  over  400  species  of  mollusks  and  350  species  of \nmarine crustaceans. There are also 7 species of dolphins, 9 species of whales, and 5 species of \nturtles,  all  of  which  endangered.  The  diversity  of  terrestrial  ecosystems  is  limited  by  the  small \nsize of the land areas, shallow depth of the soil, and the relatively high soil salinity. In spite of \nthis, more than 583 species of plants are found in the Maldives, of which 260 native species are \nrecorded, and over 190 species of birds species are recorded, 9 of which are protected under \nthe  Environmental  Law.  Between  1995  and  1999,  25  \u2018Protected  Dive  Marine  Sites\u2019  were \ndelineated in the Maldives. \n \n \n \n Tourism  and  fisheries  are  the  cornerstones  of  the  national  economy.  While  fishing \n5. \nactivity  is  well  distributed  nationally,  about  75%  of  the  tourist  resorts  lie  within  the  Central \nRegion,  and  within  relatively  easy  reach  of  Mal\u00e9  Hulhul\u00e9  International  Airport.  Mal\u00e9  is  the \ntransportation hub for all forms of transport. Tuna fisheries and the associated bait-fish fishing is \na  major  industry  in  the  Maldives  accounting  for  a  large  but  slowly  declining  proportion  of  the \nnational economy. Agriculture including timber (mainly coconut), is of relatively minor economic \nimportance  and  is  also  in  slow  decline.  Apart  from  fisheries  and  tourism,  there  is  little  other \nindustry except for ship building and ship maintenance in the atoll islands.  \n \n6. \n The  national  capital  Mal\u00e9  (population  74,069  in  2000  Census)  lies  roughly  at  the  mid \npoint  of  the  Central  Regions  and  is  the  focus  for  virtually  all  of  the  industrial  and  commercial \nactivity of the Maldives. The fact that 38% of the total population was enrolled at an educational \ninstitute in 2002, indicates the value placed on education. Focus Islands provide education up to \nsecondary standard but for post-secondary education students have to go to Mal\u00e9.  \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n \n3.  \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nInstitutional Requirements \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n7. \nIn  agreement  with  the  Project\u2019s  main  objective  of  rehabilitating  and  restoring  facilities \nand infrastructure damaged by the tsunami, a substantial overall positive environmental impact \nis  expected  as  a  result  of  the  outcomes  of  the  Project.  Rehabilitation  of  small  maritime \ninfrastructure  and  potential  causeways  will  be  within  the  right  of  way  and  will  not  lead  to \nrealignment and widening, focusing on damaged sections.  \n \nReversible short-term minor negative impacts on population and terrestrial animals may \n8. \nrelate to civil works during the construction phase, such as would be equipment vibration, dust \nand  noise  generation.  Preventing  contamination  of  the  freshwater  lens  and  preventing  further \ndepletion will be a crucial priority, for which monitoring will need to be provided. Location of solid \nwaste  management  facilities,  reed  bed  sewage  treatment  (below  ground  level)  in  selected, \nrequiring  large  areas,  and  sludge  drying  beds  may  result  in  potential  odor  problems  in  a \nconfined  island  context.  The  location  of  such  facilities  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with \nauthorities and the local population. Moreover, a buffer zone with appropriate vegetation will be \nincorporated, where possible, to attenuate nuisance and improve aesthetics. A summary list of \nimpacts throughout design, construction and operation of proposed facilities is attached in Table \n17.2. \n \nE. \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n \n1. \n \nIn  accordance  to  Law  4/93,  the  Environment  Protection  and  Preservation  Act  of \n9. \nMaldives,  all  activities  to  be  implemented  as  a  result  of  tsunami  damage  should  take  due \nconsiderations  of  the  guidelines  provided  by  the  government  authorities,  and  specifically  the \nMinistry  of  Environment  and  Construction  (MEC).  According  to  the  law,  MEC  and  other \nconcerned  government  authorities  shall  provide  the  necessary  guidelines  and  advice  on \nenvironmental  protection  and  will \nIEE  or \nenvironmental  impacts  assessment  are  required.  In  such  cases,  these  will  be  prepared  and \nsubmitted to MEC.  \n \n10. \nThe project management unit (PMU) under the executing agency will be responsible for \ncarrying  out  environmental  assessment  reports  and  their  summaries,  implementing  and \nmonitoring  mitigation  measures  and  reporting  to  ADB  for  review.  Technical  and  institutional \nmitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  detailed  design  of  the  Project.  Measures  of  a \nplanning,  functional,  institutional,  and  procedural  character  have  to  be  included  in  the  site \nselection criteria, tender documents and OHSP. Mitigation measures related to construction will \nbe stated in the contract with the Contractor, who will be responsible for the implementation of \nits  own  environmental  management  plan.  MEC  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  overall \nenvironmental compliance and general ecosystems and environmental monitoring. \n \n \n \n11. \nEnvironmental expertise will be provided by a suitably qualified member of staff of MEC, \nwhich  will  assist  the  PMU  providing  guidance,  review  of  subproject  proposals  and  where \nnecessary  undertake  the  preparation  of  environmental  assessments  and  implementation  of \nmitigation measures. During the construction and implementation phase, the PMU will provide \nquarterly  reporting  on  the  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  their \nmonitoring.  \n\nfor  given  subprojects  whether  an \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan \n\nindicate \n\n2.  \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n81 \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nF. \n \n12. \nBecause of the emergency nature of the Project, detailed public consultation with a large \nsub-sample of stakeholders in the atolls could not be undertaken. Nevertheless meetings during \nthe formulation of the Project with concerned Government agencies, bilateral agencies, NGOs \nand individuals from selected affected islands, confirmed wide interest regarding the proposed \nactivities,  as  many  of  these  are  also  seen  to  be  providing  the  necessary  framework  to  help \nimprove  the  standard  of  living  of  island-affected  communities  and  prevent  further  marine  and \nterrestrial contamination. \n \n13. \nDuring  subproject  design  and  prior  to  initiating  construction,  consultations  with \nconcerned island communities will be conducted. Environmental reports will be shared with the \ncommunities and their views and concerns reflected in the design and implementation stages.  \n \nG. \n \nEnvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  have  been  produced  to  help  guide \n14. \nenvironmental  screening  and  subproject  design,  ensuring  compliance  with  the  environmental \nassessment requirements of the Government and ADB. Road and jetty subprojects will focus on \nthe  rehabilitation  of  damaged  sections  and  not  cover  extensive  length.  No  subprojects  will  be \nimplemented  inside,  in  the  buffer  zone  or  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  designated  protected \nareas.  Activities  with  significant  impact  on  ecosystems,  such  as  dredging,  will  not  be \nconsidered. Therefore, subprojects are unlikely to have environmentally significant impacts and \nthe  Project  is  considered  to  be  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification.  All \nsubprojects will be subject to screening for environmental impacts, which will determine whether \nan IEE is necessary. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Proposed Subprojects \n\nFindings, Recommendations and Conclusion \n\nH. \n \n15. \nThe Project mostly focuses on reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. \nThere  are  some  minor  and  short-term  potentially  adverse  impacts  which  could  be  potentially \nassociated  with  some  of  the  proposed  activities  but  these  are  considered  to  be  controllable \nthrough  enforcement  of  appropriate  construction  contract  conditions.  Significant  environmental \nbenefits  may  derive  from  reduced  sedimentation  erosion  and  provision  of  adequate  sanitation \nand  solid  waste  management \nthat  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are foreseen to be associated with the proposed rehabilitation work, and \ntherefore the need for a full scale environmental impact assessment is unlikely to be required. \n\nfacilities.

It  also  damaged  the  income  and  livelihood  sources  of  about \n100,000 people. The Resettlement Framework (RF) outlines the resettlement policy principles, \nprocedures, and institutional arrangements for relocation, and income and livelihood restoration.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  does  not  include  the  relocation  of  displaced  persons.  However,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy is applicable to the relocation of displaced households as such \nrelocation  is  an  associated  activity  of  the  Project.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  on  resettlement  of \ndisplaced  and  affected  people  rules  out  involuntary  resettlement  of  displaced  or  affected \npersons.  The  Government\u2019s  \u201cguiding  principles  for  resettlement\u201d  are:  (i)  improve  or  at  least \nrestore the incomes and livelihood of relocated persons; (ii) conduct socioeconomic surveys to \nidentify  and  assess  the  Tsunami  impacts  on  affected  people;  (iii)  inform  them  as  well  as  host \npopulations of their entitlements; (iv) consult them on relocation options; (v) pay compensation \nat  mutually-agreed  rates  for  all  lost  assets;  (vi)  assist  their  relocation  by  providing  transitional \nsupport and development assistance such as land preparation, credit facilities and skill training; \n(vii)  provide  civic  infrastructure  and  community  services;  (viii)  disclose  relocation/resettlement \nplans  to  both  relocating  persons  and  their  host  communities;  and  (xi)  provide  resettlement \nentitlements to each affected household as \u201can agreed lump sum amount of money\u201d before their \nrelocation or return to their original dwellings. The above policy principles broadly match that of \nthe ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n\n3. \nThe \u201cguiding principles for resettlement\u201d prescribes assistance to displaced households: \n(i)  to  rebuild  houses  on  their  resident  islands,  if  internally  displaced;  (ii)  to  relocate  on  \u2018safe\u2019 \nislands  if  the  resident  islands  are  unsafe,  or  (iii)  to  return  to  resident  islands  from  temporary \n\u2018safe\u2019  islands  and  rebuild  houses.  All  displaced  households  will  get  livelihood  support, \ndevelopment  assistance,  civic  \u2018infrastructure\u2019  and  access  to  \u2018socioeconomic  services  and \nutilities. \n \n\nTable A18: Entitlement Matrix \n\n \nType of Loss \n\n1.

As the Project follows a sector-\nlike  approach,  procedures  for  environmental  assessment  for  sector  loans  have  been  adopted. \nAn  overall  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  as  a  part  of  the  feasibility \nstudy for assessment of generic impacts of each subcomponent. The overall IEE shows that the \nimpacts of the Project are expected to be positive especially for the component on water supply, \nsanitation and solid waste management. It also shows that no significant adverse environmental \nimpacts  are  anticipated \nfrom  other  components  and  subcomponents,  and  a  detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. Given the emergency nature of the Project, \nsubproject  specific  IEEs  could  not  be  prepared  to  serve  as  demonstration  for  preparation  of \nIEEs  and  summary  IEEs  during  project  implementation,  but  this  will  be  developed  as  part  of \nproject implementation.  \n \n2. \nThis  Environmental  Assessment  Framework  (EAF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the \nenvironmental assessment of subprojects for each subcomponent and facilitate compliance with \nenvironmental  requirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Republic  of  the \nMaldives during implementation.  \n \nB. \n\nOverview of Type of Subprojects to be Assessed \n\n \n3. \nThe  proposed  Project  have  5  main  components:  (i)  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid \nwaste management; (ii) transport; (iii) power; (iv) agriculture; and (v) fisheries.

The environmental impact analysis for each proposed \nsubproject will be conducted by an agency or individual with EIA certifications in the Maldives. \nFor  each  of  the  subprojects,  the  EAR  will  include  specific  mitigation  measures  and  financial \nsources  as  pre-requisite  for  approval  of  credit,  and  implementation  of  monitoring  and \nenforcement  program  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  none  of  the  Project  components  would \nhave any major adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n5. \nPublic consultation will be conducted through interviews, meetings, or surveys as part of \nenvironmental assessment for each subproject based on the public involvement procedures and \nguidelines  established  by  MEC  and  in  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The \nresults of public consultation will be documented and reflected in EAR. \n \n6. \nIn  accordance  to  Law  4/93,  the  Environment  Protection  and  Preservation  Act  of \nMaldives,  all  activities  to  be  implemented  as  a  result  of  tsunami  damage  should  take  due \nconsiderations  of  the  guidelines  provided  by  the  government  authorities,  and  specifically  the \nMinistry  of  Environment  and  Construction  (MEC).  According  to  the  law,  MEC  and  other \nconcerned  government  authorities  shall  provide  the  necessary  guidelines  and  advice  on \nenvironmental protection and will indicate for given subprojects whether an initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  or  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  are  required,  which  will  conform \nthe so-called EAR. In such cases, these will be prepared and submitted to MEC for review and \nendorsement.  ADB  will  review  the  first  2  subproject  IEEs  formulated  for  each  component  and \nany  proposed  EIA  and  suggest  changes  or  provide  endorsement.  Projects  with  significant \nenvironmental impact on the environment may not be eligible for funding under the Project. \n \n7. \nThe project management unit (PMU) under the executing agency will be responsible for \ncarrying  out  environmental  assessment  reports  and  their  summaries,  implementing  and \nmonitoring  mitigation  measures  and  reporting  to  ADB  for  review.  Technical  and  institutional \nmitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  detailed  design  of  the  Project.  Measures  of  a \nplanning,  functional,  institutional,  and  procedural  character  have  to  be  included  in  the  site \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n91 \n\nselection criteria, tender documents and OHSP. Mitigation measures related to construction will \nbe stated in the contract with the Contractor, who will be responsible for the implementation of \nits  own  environmental  management  plan.  MEC  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  overall \nenvironmental compliance and general ecosystems and environmental monitoring. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria of Subproject Selection \n\n \n8.  The following table summarizes environmental criteria for subproject selection: \n \n\nOverall Requirements \nNo  subproject  of  the  investment  component  will  entail  new  damage  to  marine  or  terrestrial \nenvironment consider of significance importance, be located in core or buffer areas of existing \nmarine  protected  sites,  nor  seek  to  replace  any  of  natural  ecosystems  with  designed \nagricultural/fish  processing  systems  and  infrastructure.  Where  the  proposed  interventions  may \nlead  to  nuisances  to  the  surrounding  population  (e.g.  solid  waste  management  centers  or \nsewage  treatment  facilities),  these  will  be  located  at  an  appropriate  distance  from  population \ncenters  and  meet  the  national  and  local  environmental  standards.  No  subprojects  will  be \nimplemented  in  the  core  or  buffer  zone  or  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  designated  protected \nareas.  Activities  with  significant  impact  on  ecosystems,  such  as  land  reclamation,  will  not  be \nconsidered. An environmental assessment report (EAR) will be carried out for each subproject \nand  submitted  to  MEC  for  review  and  approval.  Where  necessary,  the  EAR  will  include  an \nEnvironmental Management Plan (EMP) with specific mitigation measures and financial sources \nas  pre-requisite  for  approval  of  credit,  and  implementation  of  monitoring  and  enforcement \nprogram  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  none  of  the  Project  activities  would  have  any  major \nadverse  environmental  impacts.
