THE ROLES OF FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE REGION \n\na) Standardization and Harmonization \n\nThe roles of FMIs have \nbeen under the \nspotlight after the GFC.\n\nStandardization should \nnot only be considered \nin technical terms.\n\nbut  also in terms of \nindustry expectations: \ne.g. issuance documents.\n\nRecommendation 1a: Responsible authorities are encouraged to support the harmonization of \nissuance rules and enhancing transparency of securities and tax rules; including targeting \nprofessional investors such as financial intermediaries to enable common disclosure language, \nprocedures investor protection rules. To promote this, it is encouraged to collaborate with ASEAN+3 \nBond Market Forum and then apply the experience gained to wider APEC economies.)

THE ROLES OF FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE REGION \n\nb) Monitoring the effects of G20 regulatory initiatives\n\nThe GFC prompted G20 \nauthorities to bring in a \nnew suite of regulations.\n\nThose regulations \ninfluence markets by \nway of extraterritorial \neffects.\n\nDomestic CCPs may not \nbe appropriate for all \nAPEC markets.\n\nRecommendation 1b: Securities regulators and central banks are encouraged to monitor together \nwith the region's market participants the extraterritorial effects of developed economies' rules and \nconsider ways to address this, especially in smaller economies. Smaller jurisdictions are encouraged \nto carefully consider global policies and their appropriateness for smaller markets. They should strive \nto achieve the outcomes that have been internationally agreed \u2013 but be very mindful of what \nimplementation means for their jurisdiction. In any case, the implementation must avoid creating \nfurther fragmentation.\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n15\n\n1. THE ROLES OF FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE REGION \n\nc) Measuring the scarcity of High Quality Liquid Assets\n\nPost-GFC regulations \nand rules are forcing \nfinancial transactions to \nbe further collateralized.\n\nThere is a scarcity of \nHigh Quality Liquid \nAsset collateral.\n\nLocal currency collateral, \nincl. highly rated gov\u2019t \nbonds, is often not \naccepted internationally.\n\nRecommendation 1c: Responsible authorities are encouraged to collaborate together with \ninternational organizations, to have workshops to better understand the issues to address the \ngrowing need for HQLA collateral in the region. Measures could include how local currency assets \ncould be utilized as part of collateral accepted for cross-border trades between financial \nintermediaries and CCPs, how regional financial integration (including RTGS-CSD linkages) and better \nhedging markets would assist further liquidity, and identification of specific classes of securities \nwhere liquidity and eligibility could be expanded; followed by advocacy efforts in jurisdictions where \ncollateral eligibility could be expanded.\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n16\n\n8\n\n\f1. THE ROLES OF FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE REGION \n\nd) Infrastructure inter-operability and interconnectedness\n\nFMIs should be \nencouraged to \ncooperate in a similar \nmanner to how central \nbanks link to each other\n\nNot only large value \npayments and securities \nsettlement systems, but \nalso e-payments need to \nbe interlinked \ninternationally\n\nAchieving inter-\noperability may also \nincrease systemic risk \nfrom markets becoming \nmore interconnected\n\nRecommendation 1d: Respective authorities are encouraged to promote inter-operability among \nFMIs and participants including financial intermediaries, and evaluate the effects of \ninterconnectedness between the markets and their potential impact, implications to policy makers \nand regulators, measures to mitigate risk while avoiding \"risk-off\" or hindering financial inclusion.\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n17\n\n1.

Non-Resident Accounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency\n\na) Account structure\n\nThree dimensions:\n- asset protection; \n- cost; and \n- operational efficiency\n\nOn a cross-border basis, \nthe omnibus account \nstructure combined with \na nominee legal structure \nis the most effective \nfrom an operational. \nviewpoint \n\nFixed income assets do \nnot grant ownership rights, \nwhich has significant \npolicy implications in \nterms of national interest \nand tax purposes.\n\nRecommendation 2-2a: No need to change the way the local market is operating which could be \n(direct holding, omnibus or a mix of both) but the omnibus is the preferred option for cross-border \nflows to attract foreign investments to a local market. Both account structures can coexist. Ideally \nthe omnibus account structure should be combined with the nominee legal structure.\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n24\n\n12\n\n\f2-2. Non-Resident Accounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency\n\nb) Tax\n\nConsideration from\n- Economical perspective\n- Operational perspective \n(in addition to fair and \nequitable) \n\nInvestors can request a \nyield premium to offset a \ntax rate but will likely not \ninvest or limit activities \nshould the operational \ncomplexity be too high.\n\nFirms seek to have a tax \nregime that does not \nimpose a significant \noperational burden and \nthat is predictable \nenough.\n\nRecommendation 2-2b: Prefer no tax or a simple tax scheme (i.e.: a WHT based on a Record Date \nprinciple), no capital gain tax based on a price difference or a tax calculated on a holding period since \nthey are unmanageable on a cross-border basis. Prefer to tax at source instead of refund. For tax \ncertificates collection, prefer a one-time certificate instead of requiring yearly certificate or \ncertificate per payment. Do not require local notarization of tax certificates.\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n25\n\n2-2. Non-Resident Accounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency\n\nc) Investor Identification and Transparency\n\nReason for transparency: \nstatistical, price discovery, \nKYC, AML, quotas, tax, \nmarket surveillance, etc.\n\nDifferent asset classes \nare traded differently \nand bear different risks. \n-> different treatment \n\nTransparency can be \nachieved through \nmultiple means; \nthey can be combined.\n\nRecommendation 2-2c: Define the right balance between transparency and market efficiency. Responsible authorities \nshould review whether legal frameworks support disclosure requests and undertake legislative reforms if they do not. \nSecurities regulators should introduce requirements for bond prospectuses to facilitate disclosure requests. Upon such \nreview, following perspectives are particularly important: (1) Precise definition of the reason for the transparency to \nensure the solution addresses the needs and minimizes operational frictions for all involved parties, (2) Ensuring \nenforceability of disclosure in the law to avoid conflicting regulations between the country of issuance and the \ninvestors\u2019 country of residence, and (3) Avoiding the request of data which cannot be automatically retrieved from \nintermediaries systems or which require interpretation..\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n26\n\n13\n\n\fCoffee Break\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\n27\n\n3.

Issues Specific to Repo/Lending\n\na) Regulatory transparency\n\nRegulatory uncertainty \nincreases market risk and \nlegal risk, which makes \nthe relevant markets less \nattractive to investors. \n\nIf there is an intention to reform certain markets this \nneeds to occur before the end of the global capital \nmarket reforms. Once completed, there will be \nsignificant resistance for implementing changes, and \ntherefore act as an obstacle to foreign investment.\n\nRecommendation 2-3a: Both responsible authorities and market participants are encouraged to continue to pursue \nvarious initiatives, including promulgation and promotion of international best practices and formulation of codes \nof conduct, to further develop and improve the market, by ensuring very clear principles on regulatory \nexpectations on capital raising and investment.\n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n31\n\n2-3. Issues Specific to Repo/Lending\n\nb) Adoption of standard documentation\n\nRepo and securities lending market \nfragmentation is exacerbated by local \ndocumentation requirements and \nstandards.\n\nThe standard local documentation \noften does not contain adequate \noperational details or credit \nprotections for international \nparticipants.\n\nRecommendation 2-3b: Securities regulators and policy makers are encouraged to review the local practices if they \nadopt the international standard documentation such as the GMRA and GMSLA and undertake promotionally \ninitiatives if they do not. \n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n32\n\n16\n\n\f2-3. Issues Specific to Repo/Lending\n\nc) Tax and accounting\n\nIt is important to understand the \nimplications of having manual \nprocesses, or of requiring people to \nbe based on the ground. Such manual \nprocess would be a barrier even to its \nown market.\n\nFor example, complexity and \nuncertainty of tax can be an obstacle \nand in some instances its mechanism \nof application can prevent \nparticipation in the markets and \ntherefore not be revenue generating.\n\nRecommendation 2-3c: Responsible authorities are encouraged to supporting constant dialogues with the \nindustry representatives through public-private platforms including APFF, PASLA, ICMA, Asifma, and ABMF to \nreview current policies and practices could effect as a barrier and undertake reforms if they do. \n\nAPEC Business Advisory  Council\n\n* Recommendation 2-3d is the same as Recommendation 1c.\n\nAll trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos referenced herein belong to their respective companies.\n\n33\n\n1.

Since the global \nfinancial  crisis  (GFC)  where  FMIs  withstood  the  strains  of  extreme  volatility  and  volume,  the \nimportance  of  FMI  and  the  reinforcement  of  their  robustness  have  risen  to  the  fore  of  policy  and \nregulatory considerations that is best represented by the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for FMIs. In recent \nyears,  FMIs  are  increasingly  also  taking  on  new  roles  as  the  global  regulatory  agenda  promotes \ngreater transparency of transactions and greater standardization of financial products among others. \nFMIs continue to stand as a bulwark against market disruptions. \n\nIn 2015, the APEC Finance Ministers called for a roadmap to improve the region\u2019s FMIs and create a \nregional securities investment ecosystem to facilitate cross-border investment in capital markets to \ndeepen  markets  and  increase  economics  of  scale.  This  task was  incorporated  in  the  Cebu  Action \nPlan,  the  Finance  Ministers\u2019  multi-year  blueprint  for  financial  sector  development  in  APEC.  The \nAsia-Pacific  Financial  Forum  (APFF),  a  platform  for  collaboration  among  the  public  and  private \nsectors and multilateral and academic institutions to accelerate the development and integration of \nthe region\u2019s financial markets and services launched by the Ministers in 2013, is supporting this effort. \nUsing the APFF platform, this symposium was hosted by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) in \nSeoul, Korea on 25th April 2017. The followings is a summary of its key outcomes. \n\nFMIs  serve  to  facilitate  the  efficient  and  cost-effective  flow  of  investment  across  markets,  support \nfinancial  market  stability  and  integrity,  and  promote  greater  financial  inclusion,  fair  and  equitable \ncompetition and innovation. Historically, these were seen as nodes that accumulated market, liquidity \nand  counterparty  risks  to  facilitate  transparency  and  management.  Without  appropriate  oversight \nthey can also become a significant source of systemic risk, especially during times of market stress, \nhence came to be regulated2.   \n\nSince  the  GFC  of  2007/08,  new  complexities  and  costs  have  also  risen  that  needs  to  be  better \nunderstood and be better managed for markets to have higher levels of sustainability. For example, \nemerging capital markets can struggle with the tension between business case viability and the need \nfor  a  Central  Counterparty  (CCP)  for  nascent  derivatives  markets  to  avoid  punitive  balance  sheet \ncosts for banks operating domestically. On top of the new changes, overseas investors continue to \nbe faced with existing market access and repatriation documentation that can be streamlined, while \nthere  are  funds  post-trade  paper-intensive  services  serve  as  a  contrast  to  the  electronic  speed  of \ninvestments. Cybersecurity concerns have emerged to add to this complexity.   \n\nToday,  economies  will  need  to  consider  new  issues  and  needs  that  can  face  FMIs  and  financial \nmarkets,  including  transparency  through  a  standardized  and  common  platform  for  trade  reporting, \nimproving  coordinated  monitoring  of  markets  through  facilitation  of  cross-border  data  flows, \nstandardization of market practices, account structures, operational and processing models, as well \nas  consistent  tax  treatment  of  domestic  and  cross-border  transactions.  Regulatory  clarity  and \nprivate-public  sector  collaboration  is  key  to  realize  new  value  from  untangling  some  of  these \n\n                                                   \n1  Traditional Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) encompass a variety of institutions including Real-Time Gross \nSettlement (RTGS) systems, Large Value Payment Systems (LVPS), Automated Clearing Houses (ACHs), Securities \nSettlement Systems (SSSs), Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), Central Counterparties (CCPs) and Trade \nRepositories (TRs). FMIs are central to the clearing and settlement of transactions in the financial markets, the movement \nof money and securities, and centrally managing the counterparty risks around the world \n2  To help address the threat of systemic shocks and increase the resilience of FMI, CPSS-IOSCO in 2012, released a \nreport entitled Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (24 Principles). The report contained 24 Principles designed to \nensure a more robust infrastructure for the global financial markets and allow the infrastructure to better withstand financial \nshocks. In the subsequent five years since the publication of the CPSS-IOSCO\u2019s first report, the global financial system is \nmuch stronger and FMI adoption across the global has dramatically increased. \n\n4 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\ncomplexities, and to address the potential rise of the costs and fragmentation of markets after the \nGFC,  enhance  liquidity  and  depth,  and  lessen  the  cost  of  raising  funds  from  international  capital \nmarkets.   \n\n1.  The Roles of Financial Market Infrastructures in the Region \n\nThe April Seoul\u2019s symposium\u2019s discussions related to regulatory environment covered three key \nareas  and  recommendations  included  (1)  needs  for  clear  regulatory  goals,  (2)  private-public \nsector  engagements  to  find  optimal  solutions  to  reach  these  goals,  (3)  approaches  that \nincorporate considerations of the potential regulatory effects on emerging capital market and their \ngrowth,  and  (iv)  to  expand  high  quality  collaterals  to  include  regional  currency  assets  for  the \nregion to mitigate liquidity risk and market risks. These are highlighted as follows: \n\nThey conveyed the message that a fundamental regulatory tool is cooperation: the intensity \nof  the  relationship  will  depend  on  the  policy  objectives.  It  is  also  very  important  to \nappropriately  understand  and  to  calibrate  the  extraterritorial  implications  of  domestic \nregulations  and  its  potential  impacts.  It  raised  a  suggestion  that  regional  regulators might \nwant to set out a clear, public, medium-term strategy and their regulatory expectations. \n\nStandardization  should  not  only  be  considered  in  technical  terms  but  also  in  terms  of \nindustry expectations: as an example, harmonization of documentation, issuance rules and \nenhancing transparency of securities and tax rules; including common disclosure language \nor  procedures  for  cross-border  investors.  The  panel  encouraged  regulatory  collaboration \nwith ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) for the Asia region, and for the experiences to \nbe shared with the wider APEC members. \n\nThere is a need to monitor the extra-territorial effects of post- GFC rules being implemented \nfrom  developed  economies'  in  the  region  and  to  consider  ways  to  address  the  effects  on \nrelatively  smaller  economies  and  their  capital  markets\u2019  growth.  Smaller  jurisdictions  are \nencouraged to carefully consider the global policies; while they should strive to achieve the \noutcomes  that  have  been  internationally  agreed  to  minimize  regulatory  arbitration,  the \ninternational bodies should also understand the domestic balance needed between global \nconsistency and local capital market growth stage. \n\nParticipants discussed the need to evaluate the requirements for High Quality Liquid Assets \n(HQLA)  and  whether  local  currency  assets  could  be  utilized  collaterals  accepted  in \ninternational  trades  by  financial  intermediaries  and  CCPs.  Suggestions  were  made  on  a \nfurther  need  to  discuss  how  regional  financial  integration,  including  RTGS-CSD  linkages \nand hedging, would assist further liquidity and eligibility of local currency assets. \n\nWhile regional initiatives including access programs and activities to gain inter-operability of \nthe  markets,  there  could  be  rise  of  systemic  risk  from  becoming  more  interconnected \nmarkets,  which  would  pose  threat  especially  in  smaller  economies.  Adoption  is  best \nfacilitated  by  better  insights  and  knowledge  and  hence,  a  recommendation  was  made  to \nevaluate the potential effects of interconnectedness among the markets of different maturity \nstages in the region, possible implications to policy makers and regulators, likely measures \nthat can mitigate identified risks that are also cost and implementation efficient. \n\n2.  APEC Roadmap on Financial Market Infrastructures: Process and Instruments \n\nDriven  by  over  a  decade  of  global  and  country-level  new  regulatory  requirements  and \nimplementations,  financial  markets\u2019  evolution  and  progress,  anecdotally,  there  is  a  significantly \nheightened level of post-trade operational running costs and complexities that are in addition to \nlegacy  ones.  The  symposium  had  highlighted  concerns  that  if  these  costs  and  complexities \ncontinue  to  accumulate,  they  can  eventually  become  significant  drain  on  market  participants\u2019 \ngrowth-oriented  investments.  Hence,  after  the  regulatory  discussions,  the  symposium  then \nmoved to discuss specific areas of the capital markets that can benefit from regulatory attention \n\n5 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nto alleviate the operational and compliance complexities that have arose: \n\n2-1.

Public-private  platforms  are  encouraged  to  establish  a  baseline  measure  of  the \nmagnitude of costs and complexities in the regional cross-border post-trade securities \necosystem including fund services if possible;   \nin  cross-border  market  access  and  repatriation  activities  that  investors  will  need  to \nnavigate  to  invest  into  the  region,  to  host  private-public  sector  discussions  to \nunderstand regulatory goals and discuss how these goals can be better achieved and in \nwhat time frame;   \nto  identify  and  agree  on  specific  areas  related  in  the  market  access  and  repatriation \ncycle that can benefit from standardization and the use of 3rd party industry utilities; and \nlastly,   \nto  clarify  regulatory  expectations  for  possible  solutions  like  industry  utilities  that  can \nalleviate complexity but which can attract new regulatory requirements. \n\nd. \n\nc. \n\n2-2.  Non-Resident Accounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency \n\nThis  panel  spoke  about  on  the  topic  of  \u201caccount  structure\u201d  in  the  context  of  cross-border \ninvestments and covered various stages of intermediation. The account structure (omnibus \nor direct holding under the beneficial owner name), is often determined by macroprudential \nconsiderations  related  to  management;  cross-border  tax,  transparency,  reporting  and \noperational  requirements.  It  concluded  that  while  no  change  is  needed  to  the  way  local \nparticipants operate in their market which could be direct holding, omnibus or a mix of both, \nthe omnibus account structure is the preferred option for cross-border flows to attract foreign \ninvestments to  a  local  market. Ideally  the  omnibus  account  structure  should  be  combined \nwith the nominee legal structure to ensure optimal asset protection. The recommendations \nmade are: \n\na. \n\nIn the region, there is a need to define the appropriate balance between transparency \nand  market  efficiency.  Ensure  disclosure  requests  are  supported  by  the  laws  of  the \ncountry or the bond prospectus. Transparency requirements on different asset classes \n(equities, deposits, government securities, corporate bonds, etc) should be reviewed by \nasset class and treated differently as they can be processed differently. \n\nb.  Authorities  are  encouraged  to  consider  the  comprehensive  statutory  framework,  and \ncrucially this includes tax implications. While most mature markets do not levy tax on \nfixed income instruments, it remains each country sovereign decision to levy tax or not \nbut it should ideally be considered from (1) an economical perspective and (2) from an \noperational perspective. The easier the process the more efficient the market. \n\n2-3. \n\nIncreasing Market Efficiency: Issues specific to Repo/Lending \n\nLiquid and well-functioning repo and securities lending markets are essential to the efficient \nallocation  and  movement  of  capital  and  collateral  through  the financial  system. They  also \nplay  a  role  to  help  diversify  risk  among  different  types  of  market  participants  across \neconomies.   \n\nThe  relatively  diverse  range  of  Asia-Pacific  markets\u2019  growth  stages  give  rise  to  additional \nregional issues and challenges in developing consistent practices. Authorities, together with \nmarket practitioners and wide variety of stakeholders including multi-lateral institutions, need \nto  review  and  where  appropriate,  promote  a  roadmap  that  can  lead  to  adoptions  of \n\n6 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\ninternational documentation such as the GMRA and GMSLA. \n\n \n\n2-4. \n\nIncreasing Market Efficiency: Issues specific to Derivatives \n\nGreater  regulatory transparency  in the OTC  derivative  markets  is  a key public  policy  goal \nthat was codified at the September 2009 Pittsburgh G20 summit. In order to help  improve \nthe regulatory transparency, a number of critical milestones need to be met which includes: \n(a)  a  shared,  public  commitment  to  global  convergence  on  harmonised  reporting \nrequirements,  (b)  data  standards  and  formats,  greater  regulatory  endorsement  of  existing \nstandards  that  can  meet  desired  outcomes,  (c)  practical  ways  to  share  select  information \nacross trade repositories and borders, (d) increased availability of substituted compliance, \n(e)  promote  of  inter-operability  and  connectivity  between  trade  repositories,  and  (f)  the \ndesignation of leaders to drive the mechanism for global data aggregation.   \n\nThe  active  support  and  cooperation  of  a  range  of  stakeholders  \u2013  regulators,  market \nparticipants and infrastructure providers will be required. \n\n2-5. \n\nFund Services \n\nIn an era where more investors are investing for retirement income and can benefit from the \ndiversity of funds offered by fund passport initiatives like the Asia Region Funds Passport, \nmanaging the industry costs is important to facilitate these investors\u2019 activities. Automation \nis also required to bridge the \u201cmismatch\u201d between the high level of post-investment paper \nand inefficient spaghetti processes and the speed of electronic investments. \n\nA regulator-supported funds back-office processing utility will be needed to progress this key \nindustry  that  can  support  individuals\u2019  wealth  management,  pension  accumulation  and \ndrawdown \u2013 in the later cases, reduction of unnecessary costs to preserve returns will be \nvery important.   \n\nIndustry  utilities  can  facilitate  these  goals  and  can  take  the  form  of  a  centralized  digital \nnetwork that connects the fund industry\u2019s participants for more effective electronic exchange \nof  information  rather  than  via  email  or  other  manual  processes.  In  order  to  promote  the \ngrowth  of  portfolio  investments  in  the  form  of  funds  among  the  region,  support  for  the \nactivities of public-private platform including Asian Fund Standardization Forum (AFSF). \n\n3.  APEC Roadmap on Data Management and Technology   \n\nFinancial technologies, or Fintech are rapidly changing the shape of how financial services are \ndelivered to clients as well as managed by institutions and monitored as a whole financial market. \nHence, the symposium has been co-organized with FMI Fintech Substream. \n\n3-1. \n\nFMI Fintech \n\nFMI Fintech work stream have been discussing on Know-Your-Customer, E-Payments, and \nCybersecurity in the multi-year initiative. Identity is a baseline for participation in the formal \nfinancial  system.  However  classical  forms  of  identity  provisioning  struggle  to  reach \nunderserved  populations,  contain  clear  security  vulnerabilities,  and  cannot  be  verified \nremotely.  Digital  IDs  can  be  linked  with  electronic  forms  of  know-your-customer  (e-KYC) \nverification  mechanisms.  Therefore  Digital  IDs  and  e-KYC  initiatives  being  conducted \noutside the region need to be analyzed to document best practices that could be leveraged \nbased on the review of such initiatives within the APEC region. \n\nPayments  form  the  core  of  the  financial  services  ecosystem.  There  are  a  multitude  of \nplayers  currently  introducing  solutions  for  electronic  payments  including  governments, \nbanks, card networks, mobile operators, and pure technology companies. APEC economies \nneed  to  explore  whether  there  are  inter-operability  concerns  that  exist  in  the  APEC \n\n7 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\ne-Payments ecosystem and whether APFF can make recommendations on how to resolve \nthose concerns. \n\nThe digitization of financial services is coupled with the onset of new cyber-risks. The major \nvulnerability associated with Fintech is the multitude of new actors it brings into the financial \nservices ecosystem and the linkages created between these new actors and in some cases \ntheir  interaction  with  established  financial  institutions  and  systems  in  APEC.  APEC \neconomies are encouraged to engage in research and analysis of emerging cybersecurity \nsolutions and share those learnings with stakeholders.   \n\n3-2.  Disruptive technologies / new FMI-like entities   \n\n\u201cDisruptive\u201d \n\ntechnologies \n\ntechnologies, \nExamples  of \nrobot-advisers or artificial intelligence bring new business models that leverages on better \ndata management, faster access to data, machine learning and new paradigms represented \nby  the  decentralized  nature  of  blockchain.  The  new  business  models  when  these  new \ntechnologies intersect with financial services can create new potential risks and costs even \nas they would create new value. \n\ninclude  distributed \n\nledger \n\nAs  such,  the  panel  urged  FMIs  and  the  private  sector  to  continue  experimenting  and \ncontributing  to  industry\u2019s  awareness  and  knowledge  to  overcome  the  maturity  challenge. \nCollaborative  work  with  regulators  will  bridge  the  gaps  with  the  needs  for  new  regulatory \nframeworks.   \n\nOver  time,  regulators,  private  sector  and  FMIs  should  also  plan  to  collaborate  across \nmarkets to agree on harmonized domestic legal frameworks supporting the implementation \nof such new technologies and ensure cross-border regulatory certainty. \n\nWhere  appropriate,  Standardization  at  technical  and  business  data  level  needs  to  be \nconsidered  from  the  start  to  ensure  inter-operability  at  domestic  and  cross-border  levels. \nInter-operability  between  other  implementations  as  well  as  with  legacy  systems  and \nprocesses who will not disappear overnight.    Leveraging existing reference data standards \n(Legal  Entity  Identifier,  ISIN,  etc.)  and  business  standards  such  as  ISO  20022,  but  also \nsupporting collaborative open source initiatives such as the Hyperledger project, should be \nconsidered to avoid \u201creinventing the wheel\u201d.   \n\nThere  is  a  greater  challenge  on  the  industry  to  recognize  when  current  standards  become \nobsolete,  and  \u201copen  minds\u201d  should  be  adopted  for  new  practices  and  requirements  of  future \ntechnologies  and  their  applications  least  their  growth  potentials  are  inhibited  as  a  result  of \nill-fitting legacy standards. \n\nAuthorities  should  also  assess  the  interaction  of  financial  regulation  with  other  statutes,  such  as \nfiscal  policy  or  data  privacy  provisions,  and  consider  the  overall  impact to  the  industry.  Authorities \nneed to account for the industry\u2019s capacity i.e. available resources to innovate and execute on those \ninnovations. \n\nSymposium participants shared the above perspectives and issues to be addressed to improve the \nregion\u2019s  FMIs  and financial  markets  and  then  to facilitate cross-border  portfolio  investments  in  the \nregion. As post-GFC rules currently in the stages of implementation and new technologies are rapidly \nintroduced to various financial markets, requirements are moving. Regulations and conditions need \nto  adapt  in  a  timely  manner  to  support  the  growth  and  manage  risks.  Most  recommendations \npresented in this report are suggested to being considered immediately or within two to three years, \nas crucial window for market development and to be benefitted from a coordinated policy effort. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  participants  also  recognized  the  diverse  maturity  of  developing  stages  of  the \ncapital markets in the APEC economies, which means that one-size approach will not fit all.   \n\nThe  industry  tables  these feedback  and recommendations for  considerations  and  endorsement  by \n8 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nI. \n\n \n\nthe APEC Finance Ministers Process.   \n\nAsia-Pacific Financial Forum \nDEVELOPING APEC\u2019S FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE \n \nConference report \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nOver the past few years, various initiatives have been launched to address this issue. In 2015, the \nAPEC Finance Ministers sought to give impetus to this effort by calling for a roadmap to improve the \nregion\u2019s  FMIs  and  create  a  regional  securities  investment  ecosystem  to  facilitate  cross-border \ninvestment  in  capital  markets.  This  task  was  incorporated  in  the  Cebu  Action  Plan,  the  Finance \nMinisters\u2019 multi-year blueprint for financial sector development in APEC. The Asia-Pacific Financial \nForum (APFF), a platform for collaboration among the public and private sectors and multilateral and \nacademic institutions to accelerate the development and integration of the region\u2019s financial markets \nand services launched by the Ministers in 2013, is supporting this effort. \n\nThe  symposium  was  co-organized  by  ABAC  through  APFF  FMI  Cross  Border  Practice  and  FMI \nFintech, and hosted by the Federation of Korean Industries at FKI Conference Center in Seoul Korea \non  25th  April,  2017.  Over  sixty  participants  representing  wide  spectrum  of  organizations  in  the \nregion\u2019s  public  and  private  sectors  as  well  as  international  institutions,  Financial  Market \nInfrastructures and academic and research institutions attended the event. \n\nParticipants  discussed  the  state  and  challenges  of  Asia  Pacific  financial  markets  in  the  regulatory \nenvironment  post  financial  crisis.  The  financial  markets  are  becoming  better  connected  with \ntechnology  and  there  are  many  types  of  infrastructures  that  provide  services  to  maintain  the \nconnectivity. We  can  collectively  call  these  whole financial  market  infrastructures  including  various \ntypes of financial intermediaries and service providers, and highlight that historically, regulators saw \npayment, clearing and settlement infrastructures as nodes that accumulate various types of risks and \nhave started to regulate them as Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs).   \n\nWhile  most  traditional  FMIs  serve  to  facilitate  the  efficient  and  cost-effective  flow  of  investment \nacross  markets,  support  financial  market  stability  and  integrity,  and  promote  greater  financial \ninclusion, fair and equitable competition and innovation, they  have historically started serving from \ndomestic markets in each economy, and have had financial intermediaries bridging the differences in \nregulations, market practices and tax issues to promote cross-border portfolio trade.   \n\nThe  global  financial  crisis  (GFC)  made  us  realize  the  importance  of  transparency,  risk  mitigation \nmeasures  and  robust  market  infrastructures  to  mitigate  systemic  risk  upon  a  default  of  a  major \nmarket participant(s). Now developed markets are in a long period of ultra-low interest rates, slowing \ndown the growth in developing and emerging markets.   \n\nWe  need  to  support  the  growth  of  the  economies  while  maintaining  stability  through  enhanced \nefficient  functioning  of  the  markets,  including  promoting  the  cross-border  portfolio  investments, \nutilizing local currency assets as eligible financial collateral by both FMIs and bilaterally, maintaining \nand  broadening  access  to  cross-border  money  transfer  mechanisms  providing  the  required \ntransparency  in  affordable  and  meaningful  way,  and  incorporating  innovative  and  potentially \ndisruptive technologies. Economies will need to consider new issues and needs that can face FMIs \nand financial markets, including transparency through a standardized and common platform for trade \nreporting, improving coordinated monitoring of markets through facilitation of cross-border data flows, \nstandardization of market practices, account structures, operational and processing models, as well \nas consistent tax treatment of domestic and cross-border transactions. These measures would help \n\n \n\n9 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\naddress the potential rise of the costs and fragmentation of markets after the GFC, enhance liquidity \nand depth, making sure the smaller players\u2019 involvement, and lessen the cost of raising funds from \ninternational capital markets. By having a platform for the public and private sectors to collaborate, to \nidentify and prioritize the issues to be addressed and reflected on  in the Roadmap, we would then \neffectively communicate in the APEC region through the Cebu Action Plan. \n\nThe  discussions  in  the  Seoul  symposium  together  with  the  preparatory  conference  calls  reflected \nboard support across economies, sectors and institutions including in Latin America for the further \ndevelopment of FMIs in the region. The messages have been discussed further by the public and \nprivate institutions which participated the joint session with ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) in \nManila on 4th July 2017 and obtained broad support. This conference report describes the outcomes \nof these discussions, including the Roadmap for APEC FMIs. \n \nII. \n\nANALYSES AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n*For review and comments by officials at the Joint session with ABMF. \n\n1.  The Roles of Financial Market Infrastructures in the Region \n\nFinancial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) are central to the clearing and settlement of transactions in \nthe financial markets, the movement of money and securities, and centrally managing counterparty \nrisks  around  the  world.  Traditional  FMIs  include  central  counterparties  (CCPs),  central  securities \ndepositories (CSDs), payments infrastructure needed for settlement, and trade repositories (TRs). \n\nFMIs  strengthen  the  markets  they  serve  and  promote  and  enhance  financial  stability.  However, \nwithout appropriate oversight they can also become a significant source of systemic risk, especially \nduring  times  of  market  stress.  To  help  address  the  threat  of  systemic  shocks  and  increase  the \nresilience  of  FMI,  CPSS-IOSCO  in  2012,  released  a  report  entitled  Principles  for  financial  market \ninfrastructures (24 Principles). The report contained 24 Principles designed to ensure a more robust \ninfrastructure for the global financial markets and allow the infrastructure to better withstand financial \nshocks.  In  the  subsequent  six  years  since  the  publication  of  the  CPSS-IOSCO\u2019s  first  report,  the \nglobal  financial  system  is  much  stronger  and  FMI  adoption  across  the  globe  has  dramatically \nincreased. \n\nFinancial market participants require an open and competitive infrastructure environment which can \ndeliver  best-in-class,  reliable  and  cost-effective  services  that  produce  lower  risk,  faster  execution, \nand  transparent  data  reporting.  The  question  remains  how  these  FMIs,  together  with  financial \nintermediaries and fund service participants in the APEC region can best deliver such services. With \ndifferent products covered, investment strategies employed and a wide variety and caliber of trading, \nclearing and settlement venues, the future of FMI in the region remains uncertain. Clear consensus \nexists among market participants and policymakers on the critical importance of central clearing and \nincreased need for transparency. However, a great deal more work remains to be done to achieve \nthe overarching objectives and great promise of robust financial architecture that promotes balanced \nand sustainable growth in the region.   \n\nA  fundamental  regulatory  tool  is  international  collaboration  and  cooperation.  Working  with  the \nindustry  to  identify  market/systemic  weaknesses  is  encouraged.  It  is  also  very  important  to \nappropriately  calibrate  the  extraterritorial  implications  of  domestic  regulation,  and  its  potential \nnegative impact. Hence, a consultative approach, giving market participants and stakeholders ample \ntime to respond to public consultations on rules and regulations to avoid cross-border conflicts and \nunintended consequences is welcomed. \n\nRelationships  should  leverage  existing  multilateral  organizations,  but  in  addition  to  \u2013  not  as  a \nreplacement  for  \u2013  bilateral  relationships.  There  should  be  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  impact \nwhich  regulatory  changes  and  infrastructure  implementations  have  on the  efficiency  of  a  market  \u2013 \nand  acknowledgement  that  the  cost  of  introducing  inefficiencies  will  be  avoided  by  participants \n10 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nwherever  possible,  sometimes  leading  to  unintended  consequences  (such  as  shifting  operations \naway  from  the  jurisdiction  or  having  to  compensate  investors  for  the  additional  operational  cost \nthrough increased yields of sovereign issues).   \n\nThere  needs  to  be  a  reckoning  of  the  regulatory  demands  and  consideration  of  adjusting  the \nregulatory  framework  to  suit  each  market.  The  over-riding  regulatory  objective  should  be  to  foster \nstability and trust in the financial markets, conducting, when appropriate, a cost-benefit analysis for \nnew  regulation  to  assess  whether  it  might  harm  market  development  or  the  economy.  Using  risk \nbased  analysis  for  adoption  of  new  regulation  -  how  much  risk  is  in  the  market  vs  how  much \nregulation is being created to address that risk - could be a useful tool to approach the issue. \n\nThe roles of FMIs have been under the spotlight after the GFC as part of the measures to enhance \nfinancial stability while maintaining the availability of funding channels to support the growth of the \neconomy. While regional  cooperative  initiatives  to  promote  issuance  and  liquidity  of  local  currency \nbonds  are  underway  through  standardization  and  harmonization,  the  effects  of  G20  regulatory \ninitiatives could impact market participants in other economies in APEC. Responsible authorities and \nprivate sectors together are encouraged to monitor such effects and review regulations and policy \nmeasures  to  address  such  issues  including  a  potential  scarcity  of  High Quality  Liquid  Assets. It is \nalso  encouraged  to  review  the  effects  of  interconnectedness  as  further  connectivity  among  the \nmarkets progresses. \n\nThe  GFC  prompted  G20  authorities  to  bring  in  a  new  suite  of  regulations  starting  with  developed \neconomies  in  North  America,  Europe  and  parts  of  Asia.  Those  regulations  influence  markets  and \nmarket participants in developing and emerging markets by way of extraterritorial effects, while those \neconomies may bring in similar sets of regulations in their own markets. APEC economies need to \nunderstand  the  effects  of  mandatory  margining  of  non-centrally  cleared  OTC  derivatives,  the \nproblems that creates with definitions of eligible collateral and different economies\u2019 rules. FMIs are \nadjusting to facilitate cross-border collateral transfers through linkages. \n\nQuestions  arose  from  regulators  and  policy  makers  in  smaller  economies  as  to  whether  such \neconomies  should  be  required  to  establish  local  central  counterparties  (CCPs)  which  accept  local \ncurrency  assets  as  eligible  collateral.  Challenges  include  relatively  low  local  currency  trading \nvolumes,  leading  to  questions  of  how  these  CCPs  would  achieve  economies  of  scale  and  netting \nefficiencies, and whether utilizing CCPs outside of their home economy would be more viable. We \nobserve  that  some  countries  outside  of  APEC  have  established  their  own  CCPs  to  keep  margin \n(collateral) onshore. Where volumes are sufficient to achieve economies of scale this has worked; in \nother places it has stimulated the development of offshore non-deliverable markets in response to \nhigh clearing fees.    In its 2012 Emerging Markets Derivatives Paper, IOSCO noted that economies \nwith smaller, less developed derivatives markets should consider mandatory OTC margining as an \nalternative  to  investing  in  small-scale  onshore  clearing  infrastructure.  APEC  economies  have  a \nbreadth of different types of markets. While there has not been discussion to create a regional CCP \nin  APEC,  as  markets  grow,  such  a  CCP  may  be  necessary.  In  this  regard,  regional  discussion  to \nshare experiences is encouraged. \n\nAs we understand that not all OTC derivative transactions are cleared by CCPs, there is also a role \nfor  financial  intermediaries  to  manage  risk  bilaterally,  as  well  as  collateral.  Policy  makers  need  to \nunderstand  the  developments  on  the  bilateral  front.  APEC  economies  need  to  identify  the  issues \napplicable  to  both  the  CCP  and  the  bilateral  clearing  constructs,  including  segregated  third  party \ncustodial  accounts  to  manage  counterparty  risk.  Nevertheless,  stages  of  market  development  in \nAPEC economies vary greatly. The development of FMIs needs to be considered in line with such \nstages. \n\na)  Standardization and harmonization \n\nOne of the key tools to bring efficiency to the global markets is to espouse standardization wherever \npracticable.  Standardization  should  not  only  be  considered  in  technical  terms,  where  it  is  perhaps \nmore  obvious  (such  as  the  utilization  of  ISO20022  for  messaging),  but    also  in  terms  of  industry \n11 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nexpectations: as an example, harmonizing issuance documents might help both issuers streamline \nmultinational issues and increase investors\u2019 appetite to diversify through cross-border investments.   \n\n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Regional  financial  integration  initiatives  are  showing  how  we  can  prevent  fragmentation  while \nmaintaining  rapid  growth  in  respective  local  markets.  For  instance,  AMBIF  are  targeting \ninstitutional investors such as financial intermediaries, hence accepting English as the common \ndisclosure language with templates, adhering to international accounting standards, and relaxing \nregulations to incentivise issuers to utilize this platform to obtain finance from regional markets. \n\nRecommendation  1a:  Responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  support  the  harmonization  of \nissuance  rules  and  enhancing  transparency  of  securities  and  tax  rules;  including  targeting \nprofessional  investors  such  as  financial  intermediaries  to  enable  common  disclosure  language, \nprocedures investor protection rules. To promote this, it is encouraged to collaborate with ASEAN+3 \nBond Market Forum and then apply the experience gained to wider APEC economies. \n\nHarmonization can be based on outcomes as well \u2013 for instance, collateral rules can be a powerful \nalternative  to  clearing  mandates  where  they  are  impractical  or  inefficient.  Harmonization  can  also \nhelp  drive  broader  usage  of  regional  assets  \u2013  for  instance,  regional  bonds  could  be  used  more \nbroadly  as  collateral  instead  of  US  Treasuries  which  remain  the  preferred  tool.  Such  regional \nissuances promotion projects should also be supported by central and policy bank practices \u2013 they \nshould, for example, assess the liquidity impact of their collateral practices.   \n\nb)  Monitoring the effects of G20 regulatory initiatives \n\nG20 regulatory initiatives post-GFC are affecting not only the developed economies in the world but \nalso developing APEC economies. For example, although promotion of central clearing is the policy \nobjective  of  the  non-centrally  cleared  derivatives  mandatory  margining  regime,  some  APEC \neconomies lack the economies of scale to establish their own CCP, and local currency collateral may \nnot  be  accepted  as  eligible  collateral  at  international  CCPs.    This  is  a  particular  problem  for \njurisdictions whose currencies are not freely tradable or convertible. \n\nThe industry and regulators must acknowledge that in order to be efficient, infrastructures must have \na combination of scale and competition on comparable services; in smaller markets such as those in \nAsia,  this  might  not  be  achievable  and  therefore  it  must  be  accepted  that  some  infrastructure \nservices might not be best offered onshore. It must be remembered that the purpose of promoting \nthe use of infrastructure is not an end in itself, but rather as a risk mitigation tool \n\n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  For  example,  forcing  clearing  of  OTC  derivatives  or  the  use  of  listed  derivatives  for  hedging \nthese transactions might force institutions to accept imperfect hedging, therefore shifting the risk \nfrom the financial markets into the real economy. Corporate end users may be denied favorable \nhedge accounting treatment in such circumstances and choose not to hedge as a result.       \n\nInfrastructures,  such  as  CCPs,  not  only  require  scale  and  significant  capital,  but  also  significant \nregulatory oversight \u2013 and implementing regulatory principles remains a challenge. For instance, it \nremains a challenge to finalize recovery and resolution plans for CCPs.   \n \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Policy makers from some emerging APEC economies are considering if they need to establish a \nlocal OTC derivatives CCP in their respective jurisdictions, as most local market participants are \nnot able to post their local currency-denominated assets to major international derivatives CCPs, \nusually  due  to  capital  account  restrictions.  Some  economies  in  APEC  are  G20  members  and \nhence are asked by international regulatory organizations if and when they intend to introduce \ncentral clearing. However smaller economies may find it difficult to achieve economies of scale \nin such CCPs given high cost of establishment, development and maintenance, as well reduced \nnetting efficiencies in a small local currency market. \n\n12 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\uf0d8  Brazil  might  be  a  market  which  has  the  breadth,  depth  and  financial  deepening  to  provide  all \ntypes  of  hedges  to  its  local  banks  and  corporates,  such  that  they  can  compete.  Domestic \nBrazilian CCPs are interlinked and interoperable, so the pricing and netting benefits accrue to \nusers, who are then able to provide hedges at roughly the same price as an international CCP. \n\n \nRecommendation 1b: Securities regulators and central banks are encouraged to monitor together \nwith  the  region's  market  participants  the  extraterritorial  effects  of  developed  economies'  rules  and \nconsider ways to address this, especially in smaller economies. Smaller jurisdictions are encouraged \nto carefully consider global policies and their appropriateness for smaller markets. They should strive \nto  achieve  the  outcomes  that  have  been  internationally  agreed  \u2013  but  be  very  mindful  of  what \nimplementation  means  for  their  jurisdiction.  In  any  case,  the  implementation  must  avoid  creating \nfurther fragmentation.   \n\nc)  Measuring the scarcity of High Quality Liquid Assets \n\nPost-GFC  regulations  and  bank  prudential  rules  are  forcing  financial  transactions  to  be  further \ncollateralized.  Even  if  there  was  to  be  a  tapering  of  this  through  quantitative  easing  or  other \nmeasures were introduced to increase the stock of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) available to \nthe market, there could be still a scarcity of HQLA collateral to provide enough financing, including in \ndeveloping markets. \n\nLocal currency collateral, including highly rated government bonds with very little credit risk, is often \nnot commonly accepted in international / foreign markets due either to market custom or the internal \nguidelines  of  key  market  intermediaries;  limiting  the  flow  of  collateral  and  liquidity  in  the  bond \nmarkets.  Barriers  to  cross-border  collateral  flow  due  to  limited  collateral  eligibility  requirements; \nimpact on markets and liquidity; affected market participants. \n\nRecommendation  1c:  Responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  collaborate  together  with \ninternational  organizations,  to  have  workshops  to  better  understand  the  issues  to  address  the \ngrowing need for HQLA collateral in the region. Measures could include how local currency assets \ncould  be  utilized  as  part  of  collateral  accepted  for  cross-border  trades  between  financial \nintermediaries  and  CCPs,  how  regional  financial  integration  (including  RTGS-CSD  linkages)  and \nbetter  hedging  markets  would  assist  further  liquidity,  and  identification  of  specific  classes  of \nsecurities  where  liquidity  and  eligibility  could  be  expanded;  followed  by  advocacy  efforts  in \njurisdictions where collateral eligibility could be expanded. \n\nd)  Infrastructure inter-operability and interconnectedness \n\nMarket  infrastructures,  including  central  banks,  should  be  encouraged  to  cooperate  \u2013  in  a  similar \nmanner to how central banks already link to each other to allow cross-border DvP settlements. \n\n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  To  mitigate  settlement  risk,  CSIF  are  linking  central  banks  and  CSDs  to  establish  the  first \ncross-border  DvP  settlements.  While  it  will  consist  of  a  network  of  bilateral  linkages, \nstandardization of technical components will mitigate the risk of becoming a complex network. \nSuch initiatives are leading the way to utilize platforms for local bond markets across the region.   \n\nWhile  regional  initiatives  include  access  programs  and  activities  to  achieve  inter-operability  of  the \nmarkets,  there  could  be  rise  of  systemic  risk  from  markets  becoming  more  interconnected,  which \nmay pose a threat especially in smaller economies. \n\nRecommendation  1d:  Respective  authorities  are  encouraged  to  promote  inter-operability  among \nFMIs  and  participants \nthe  effects  of \ninterconnectedness  between  the  markets  and  their  potential  impact,  implications  to  policy  makers \nand regulators, measures to mitigate risk while avoiding \"risk-off\" or hindering financial inclusion. \n\nintermediaries,  and  evaluate \n\nincluding \n\nfinancial \n\n \n\n13 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.  APEC Roadmap on Financial Market Infrastructures: Process and Instruments \n\n2-1. Securities Markets: Post-Trade Ecosystem \n\nThe  securities market  post-trade  ecosystem  is  a  large  one  and for the  purposes of the  APFF  FMI \nsymposium, we have defined the securities market\u2019s post-trade ecosystem as including     \n\n\uff081\uff09 Financial  Market  Infrastructures  (FMI);  securities  central  counterparties  (CCP),  central \n\nsecurities depositories and payments infrastructure needed for settlement, \n\n\uff082\uff09 Securities \n\nintermediaries  and  messaging  systems \n\nincluding  custodian  banks  and \n\nbroker-dealers; and \n\n\uff083\uff09 Fund  services  participants  including  centralized  industry  fund  services  platforms,  transfer \n\nagencies and fund administrators. \n\nDriven  by  over  a  decade  of  global  and  country  level  new  regulatory  requirements  and \nimplementations,  financial  markets\u2019  evolution  and  progress,  anecdotally,  there  is  a  significantly \nheightened level of post-trade operational running costs and complexities in the industry that are in \naddition to legacy ones.   \n\nThe symposium had highlighted concerns that if costs and complexities continue to accumulate, they \ncan eventually become significant drain on participants\u2019 growth-oriented investments. Over time, an \nunintended effect can arise if the industry prioritises scarcer resources into certain areas and divert \nattention  away  from  others  which  can  inhibit  markets\u2019  progress  in  this  area.  Unnecessary \ncomplexities and costs also act as invisible \u201cbehind the border\u201d barriers to cross-border investment \nactivities  and  well  as  financial  market  integration  that  can  improved  economies  of  scale  to  attract \nactivities.   \n\nAs  a  starting  point,  the  potentials  to  realize  cost,  compliance  and  regulatory  reporting  efficiency \nbenefits can be found in the region\u2019s diverse set of market access and repatriation requirements and \ntheir  inherent  documentary  compliance  and  regulatory  reporting  activities;  for  example,  in  the \nAccount  Opening  stage  of  the  illustrated  market  access  and  repatriation  cycle  below.  Greater \nstandardization and the use of FMI as industry utilities  have been highlighted as two possible \nsolutions. In the future, technology or \u201cRegTech\u201d may also play roles to facilitate such efficiency goals. \nThe  panel  has  also  voiced  the  need  for  private-public  sector  collaboration  to  establish  shared \nunderstanding of regulatory goals which can lead to better approaches towards compliance. \n\nEvery  financial  market  will  have  a  set  of  cross-border  market  entry  and  repatriation  steps  that \nunderpin cross-border investments. The efficiency in fulfilling these steps count towards the market\u2019s \noverall cost, operational complexity level and risk levels \u2013 which is of concern to all participants.   \n\nThis set of cross-border market entry and repatriation steps generally consists of the following \n\ni.  New Account Opening \nii.  Market Entry and Capital injection \niii. \nFX Execution and Hedging \niv.  Clearing and Settlement \nv. \nvi.  Repatriation \nvii.  Reporting \n\nAsset Servicing or Corporate Actions and Tax \n\n \n\n14 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nThe following illustration provides a view of the ecosystem. \n\n                              Source: Deutsche Bank   \n\n \n\nA  cross-border  participant  will  face  the  costs  and  complexities  that  are  amplified  by  the  actual \nnumber of activities, the frequency and extent of changes that affect these activities and the number \nof markets that this cross-border participant is vested in.   \n\nIdeally,  there  can  be  a  review  of  the  related  post-trade  documentary  and  reporting  regulatory \nrequirements  to  determine  which  legacy  requirements  may  be  retired  and  which  areas  can  be \nstreamlined and in other cases, to automate using advance technology.   \n\nTherefore,  four  recommendations  related  to  cross-border  securities  post-trade  ecosystem  were \nmade. They are   \n\n2-1a.  Public-private  platforms  are  encouraged  to  establish  a  baseline  measure  of  the \nmagnitude of costs and complexities in the cross-border post-trade securities ecosystem \nincluding fund services if possible.   \n\n2-1b. \n\nIn  cross-border  market  access  and  repatriation  activities  that  investors  will  need  to \nnavigate  to  invest  into  the  region,  to  conduct  private-public  sector  discussions  to \nunderstand regulatory goals and discuss how these goals can be better achieved and in \nwhat time frame. \n\n2-1c.  To  identify  and  agree  on  specific  areas  related  in  the  market  access  and  repatriation \n\ncycle that can benefit from standardization and the use of 3rd party industry utilities. \n\n2-1d.  To  clarify  regulatory  expectations  for  possible  solutions  like  industry  utilities  that  can \nalleviate complexity but which can attract new regulatory requirements. For example, the \nuse  of  industry  utilities  can  be  a  cost-effective  standardization  approach  to  reduce \ndocumentary and reporting complexity. However, its use can involve regulations related \nto 3rd party service providers, recovery and resolution, data protection, outsourcing and \nCloud \u2013 and which can lead to new uncertainties, costs and complexities.   \n\nA sequencing of the recommendations would be beneficial to build on each step of understanding \nand  momentum.  The  recommendations  here  are  for  the  cross-border  securities  post-trade \n\n15 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\necosystem.  They  can  be  related  to  some  of  the  recommendations  by  the  Panel  on  Non-Resident \nAccounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency; and the Panel on Fund Services which is \nsimilarly  focused  increasing  automation  to  reduce  complexity  and  to  support  cross-border  funds \nactivities. \n\n2-2. Non-Resident Accounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency \n\nAccount  structure,  Tax,  Investor  Identification  and  Transparency  are  influenced  by  each  market \ndevelopment  history  and  current  level  of  maturity.  There  is  neither  absolute  truth  nor  global \nconsensus  but  these  three  matters  are  discussed  around  the  world  due  to  their  importance  for \nmarkets\u2019  liquidity  and  stability.  These  two  elements  (liquidity  and  stability)  can  be  used  (among \nothers)  as  measurable  benchmark  to  assess  the  efficiency  of  a  particular  market.  While \nharmonization is a great ambition, it is not an absolute must as any barrier to cross-border flows can \nbe solved unilaterally by the market where the barrier is observed. To achieve harmonization while \nleaving  each  country  managing  its  own  priorities  at  its  own  pace,  safely  and  least  costly,  it  is \nrecommended  that  the  responsible  authorities  should  review  whether  legal/tax  frameworks \nsupport international rules and best practices and undertake reforms if they do not. Indeed, \nany domestic investor becomes an international investor as soon as he invests outside of his home \nmarket. \n\nJurisdictional  authorities  should  clearly  articulate  their  statutory  objectives:  asset  protection,  tax \ncollection,  market  surveillance  prior  engaging  into  market  reforms  touching  any  of  these  three \ndimensions. This will allow fair assessment of the assets by foreign investors - which is particularly \nrelevant for some markets in the region. \n\na)  Account structure \n\nThree dimensions must be considered when looking at the optimal account structure for a market: \nasset protection, cost and operational efficiency. It is also important to keep in mind that multiple \naccount structures can co-exist in the same market for different asset classes and even for the same \nasset class. Each structure offers different advantages and has limitations. On a pure domestic basis, \nany  account  structure  can  be  adopted  while  on  a  cross-border  basis,  extra  considerations  are \nrequired. The objective is to strike the right balance between transparency and operational efficiency \nknowing that market needs can evolve over time together with the market maturity level. \n\nThe account structure supports the identification of legal ownership and asset protection attached to \nsecurities in case of insolvency of a counterparty, an intermediary or an infrastructure. It is also an \nimportant component of the custody chain which influences market participation, risk mitigation and \nsettlement efficiency. This is further exacerbated on a cross-border basis. \n\nOn  a  cross-border  basis,  empirical  evidences  show  that  the  omnibus  account  structure  combined \nwith  a  nominee  legal  structure  is  the  most  effective  from  an  operational  viewpoint  and  is  also  the \npreferred method of international investors to enter a market. Indeed, opening direct accounts at the \nlevel of the CSD prevents intermediaries to isolate the investors from local complexities. \n\n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Reforms,  when  introduced,  must  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  they  are  meeting  the  intended \nobjectives. For instance, recently an APEC economy has introduced the ability to bulk orders. \nWhile  this  is  a  positive  development,  it  does  not  fundamentally  meet  the  need  to  have  a \n\u2018nominee\u2019 or \u2018omnibus\u2019 account structure.   \n\n\uf0d8  Equities  are  traded  on  an  exchange  with  a  high  concentration  on  the  main  liquidity  pool. \nFixed-income is mostly OTC, trading takes place on a  decentralized basis, hence the custody \nchain is also decentralized. Korea re-introducing the omnibus account for equities as of March \n6th, 2017. China adopted the omnibus for Stock Connect.   \n\nIt is important as well that fixed income assets do not grant ownership rights, which has significant \n16 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\npolicy  implications  in  terms  of  national  interest  and  tax  purposes.  When  information  and \ntransparency are required with regards to ownership, disclosure regimes should be preferred over \nsegregated  account  structures;  and  authorities  should  be  aware  of  the  difficulty  of  obtaining \nqualitative data compared to quantitative data. Quantitative data can be in most instances used for \npolicy and monitoring purposes, and the incremental value of the qualitative data for these purposes \noften does not justify the cost of systematic collection. \n\nIn the context of CCPs regulators looked at the ideal account structure to ensure portability but best \nis to leave the choice to the asset owner. \n\nRecommendation 2-2a: No need to change the way the local market is operating which could be \n(direct holding, omnibus or a mix of both) but the omnibus is the preferred option for cross-border \nflows to attract foreign investments to a local market. Both account structures can coexist. Ideally the \nomnibus account structure should be combined with the nominee legal structure. \n\nIn  the  spirit  of  reciprocity,  jurisdictions  should  strive  to  harmonize  fiscal  treatment  across  asset \nclasses. In fiscal matters, simplification should be the driving principle. \n \nb)  Tax \n\nAuthorities  are  encouraged  to  consider  the  comprehensive  statutory  framework,  and  crucially  this \nincludes tax implications. While most mature markets do not levy tax on fixed income instruments, it \nremains each country sovereign decision to levy tax or not but it should ideally be considered from \n(1) an economical perspective (e.g.: will the tax revenues be offset by an increase of yield) and (2) \nfrom  an  operational  perspective  (e.g.:  is  the  tax  computation  and  collection  processes \noperationally efficient of will they negatively affect the liquidity of the instruments).   \n\nWhile  the  economical  relevance  of  the  tax  can  be  debated  between  the  Tax  authorities  and  the \nissuers (corporate and debt management office), the operational efficiency is a lower hanging fruit to \ncatch. Indeed, investors can request a yield premium to offset an excessive tax rate but will likely not \ninvest or limit their activity should the operational complexity be too high.   \n\nWhile \u2018no tax\u2019 is the easiest model to operate, should there be tax levied on fixed-income instruments, \nit  is  important  to  consider  its  extra  complexity  under  a  cross-border  environment.  Typically,  tax \nrequiring computation based on price difference (certain capital gain tax or VAT) or holding period are \nthe most complex to operate on a cross-border basis. Processes requiring local notarization, original \ndocuments,  and  the  use  of  a  local  agent  should  be  avoided  as  they  bear  a  heavy  cost  and  add \ncomplexity. \n\n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  A Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) implemented in Scandinavia was reversed when the capital \nmarket  liquidity  dried  completely.  The  new  FTT  being  discussed  in  Europe  is  facing  many \nhurdles and could pose a threat to collateral management related transactions which are a major \npillar of liquidity.   \n\n\uf0d8  Japan changed its tax scheme to get rid of clean and dirty JGBs with the benefits to merge the \n\n\uf0d8  China  recently  confirmed  that  for  CIBM  there  would  be  no  capital  gain  and  no  tax  at  all  for \n\ntwo liquidity pools.   \n\ngovernment bonds and municipals.   \n\n\uf0d8  Chinese Taipei simplified the tax scheme for Formosa Bonds in order to attract foreign investors.   \n\uf0d8  Some other APEC economies markets suffer because of their tax complexities. \n \nWithholding tax process can be optimized by preferring a \u201ctax at source\u201d principle. The second best \noption  is  a  \u201cquick  tax  refund\u201d  process  followed  by  a  \u201cstandard  refund\u201d.  The  collection  of  tax \ncertificates  to  define  the  tax  rate  of  the  investor  can  also  be  optimized  by  preferring  a  \u201cperpetual\u201d \ncertificate valid until a change occur. The second best option is a recurrent certificate (every X years). \nThe  least  preferred  is  a  certificate  required  for  each  payment.  The  collect  of  certificates  can  be \n\n17 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\ngreatly facilitated by the intermediaries in the custody chain so it is advisable to leverage them. \n\nA frequent misgiving is that financial institutions, especially foreign ones, are unwilling to pay taxes; \nin reality, firms seek to have a tax regime that does not impose a significant operational burden and \nthat is predictable enough to permit accurate pricing of the assets.   \n\nAn ideal tax regime will unlikely be found; however, even imperfect regimes can yield the expected \nlevel of income. Simple regimes can improve fiscal compliance. On the contrary, complex regimes \nwill  increase  the  operational  cost  of  servicing  capital  market  assets.  This  increased  cost  is \nincorporated in the asset valuation, and therefore will increase the interest demanded by investors \non  domestic  issues  including  sovereign  ones;  as  a  result,  it may  be that the  marginal  tax  revenue \nbenefit might be erased by the higher yield.   \n\nThe impact of tax policies on capital market policies must be also well understood. For example, the \nfocus on beneficial ownership in an APEC economy is driven by the wish to broaden the tax base; \nhowever,  this  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  efficiency  of  trading.  Authorities  are  encouraged  to \nconsidering other implementation options provided there is no overwhelming fiscal leakage.   \n\nEvidence  suggests  that  beneficial  ownership  shifts  have  not  been  used  for  tax  avoidance;  even \nunder  the  current  regime  where  DTA\u2019s  vary  and  investors  might  benefit  from  taking  advantage  of \nspecific agreements by shifting designated owners just before the record date, there is no indication \nthat they are in fact doing so.   \n\nIf exemptions are withdrawn, data used for assessment should make use of the existing data pools, \nsuch as the one collected under the OECD Common Reporting Standards \n\nIn terms of tax principles, it is suggested that authorities avoid transactional taxes, and privilege the \nrecord date principle over the holding period calculation methods.   \n\nGenerally,  taxation  should  be  based  on  operations  based  in  the  jurisdiction.  Cross-border  capital \ninvestments are not actual operations, and should therefore not be equated to income tax. Removing \nwhat is effectively a transaction tax is not a harmful tax practice. It does not result in \u201cbase erosion \nand profit shifting\u201d. \n\nRecommendation 2-2b: Prefer no tax or a simple tax scheme (i.e.: a WHT based on a Record Date \nprinciple), no capital gain tax based on a price difference or a tax calculated on a holding period since \nthey are unmanageable on a cross-border basis. Prefer to tax at source instead of refund. For tax \ncertificates collection, prefer a one-time certificate instead of requiring yearly certificate or certificate \nper payment. Do not require local notarization of tax certificates. \n\nc)  Investor Identification and Transparency   \n\nThere are multiple reasons why transparency may be desired by issuers,  investors, tax authorities \nand/or regulators. Such reasons can be: statistical purpose, price discovery, KYC, AML, quotas, tax, \nmarket surveillance, etc.) \n\nDifferent asset classes (e.g.: equities, fixed income, investment funds) are traded differently and bear \ndifferent risks (I.e.: equities give an ownership right over a company while bonds only give a mere \nright  to  an  interest  without  ownership),  hence  different  transparency  levels  may  be  relevant  and \ndesired for each asset class. Not all instruments are equal, hence should be treated differently. \n\nTransparency  can  be  achieved  through  multiple  means:  regulators\u2019  bilateral  communication, \nsegregation  of  accounts  at  CSD  level,  use  of  a  unique  ID  at  trading  level,  trade  repository  or \ndisclosure reporting. Again, each approach has different merits and some are more suited to certain \nasset classes or for a certain purpose, they can also be combined. \n\nRecommendation  2-2c:  Define  the  right  balance  between  transparency  and  market  efficiency. \nResponsible  authorities  should  review  whether  legal  frameworks  support  disclosure  requests  and \n\n18 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nundertake legislative reforms if they do not. Securities regulators should introduce requirements for \nbond  prospectuses  to  facilitate  disclosure  requests.  Upon  such  review,  following  perspectives  are \nparticularly important: (1) Precise definition of the reason for the transparency to ensure the solution \naddresses  the  needs  and  minimizes  operational  frictions  for  all  involved  parties,  (2)  Ensuring \nenforceability of disclosure in the law to avoid conflicting regulations between the country of issuance \nand  the  investors\u2019  country  of  residence,  and  (3)  Avoiding  the  request  of  data  which  cannot  be \nautomatically retrieved from intermediaries systems or which require interpretation. \n\n2-3. Increasing Market Efficiency: Issues Specific to Repo/Lending \n\nLiquid  and  well-functioning  repo  and  securities  lending  markets  are  essential  to  the  efficient \nallocation and movement of capital and collateral through the financial system. They also play a role \nto  help  diversify  risk  among  different  types  of  market  participants  across  economies.  Many  of  the \nissues facing Asia-Pacific repo and securities lending markets are common to international markets; \nhowever,  the  relatively  fragmented  nature  of  Asia-Pacific  markets,  as  well  as  the  wide  variation  in \nlevels of development of domestic markets, give rise to additional regional issues and challenges in \ndeveloping  consistent  practices.  Hence,  responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  review  and \npromote  international  best  practices,  promote  adoption  of  standard  documentation,  review  current \npolicies  and  practices,  and  discuss  expansion  of  local  collateral  eligibility  requirements  to  further \npromote movement of capital and collateral while ensuring risk mitigation. \n\n\u201cImportance of repo/lending that bring the liquidity of overall market\u201d \n\nRepo/Lending  markets  bring  to  securities  markets  significant  benefits:  they  allow  cost  reduction, \nimprove  risk  management,  and  bring  liquidity.  Financial  markets  and  public  authorities  are \nencouraged to understand the benefits of short selling: for example, it allows very long term investors \nto  maintain  their  long  positions  while  controlling  risk  hence  influences  heavily  the  appetite  for \ninvesting in the market. \n\nMarket participants have identified several challenges with respect to the repo and securities lending \nmarkets in Asia-Pacific. Policy at the national, regional, and international levels (such as monetary \npolicy,  capital  account  restrictions,  or  international  prudential  regulation)  can  affect  the  availability \nand liquidity of collateral, especially in the cross-border markets. Collateral eligibility requirements, \nincluding  those for  local-currency  collateral  can  affect  liquidity  in  the  international  markets  as  well. \nShort-selling  rules  and  disclosure  regimes  can  impact  the  markets  as  well,  in  both  positive  and \nnegative  ways.  Finally,  collateral  and  inventory  optimization  is  a  major  concern  for  direct  market \nparticipants,  especially  those  with  a  need  to  dynamically  manage  a  range  of  types  of  collateral \nacross markets and entities. \n\nFortunately,  both  policymakers  and  market  participants  continue  to  pursue  various  initiatives  to \nfurther  develop  and  improve  the  market.  These  include  continued  promulgation  and  promotion  of \ninternational best practices, formulation of codes of conduct, adoption of international documentation \nsuch as the GMRA and GMSLA to provide better transparency to regulators in the region. \n\na)  Regulatory transparency \n\nRegulatory uncertainty increases market risk and legal risk, which makes the relevant markets less \nattractive  to  investors.  It  is  therefore  important  for  regulators  to  clearly  articulate  their  regulatory \nintent, and be consistent in its implementation. While there is certainly a benefit from learning from \nregulatory implementation in other jurisdictions, if there is an intention to reform certain markets this \nneeds to occur before the end of the global capital market reforms. Once these are completed, there \nwill be significant resistance by financial institutions for implementing changes, and therefore act as \nan obstacle to foreign investment.   \n\nIt is important that authorities ensure that the reforms they introduce are appropriate for the realities \nof their market. For example, currently only the very largest markets in APEC are likely to have the \n\n19 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nscale to justify the global standards on financial market infrastructures3. \n\nRecommendation  2-3a:  Both  responsible  authorities  and  market  participants  are  encouraged  to \ncontinue  to  pursue  various  initiatives,  including  promulgation  and  promotion  of  international  best \npractices  and  formulation  of  codes  of  conduct,  to  further  develop  and  improve  the  market,  by \nensuring very clear principles on regulatory expectations on capital raising and investment.   \n\nb)  Adoption of standard documentation   \n\nRepo  and  securities  lending  market  fragmentation  is  exacerbated  by  local  documentation \nrequirements and standards; also the standard local documentation often does not contain adequate \noperational details or credit protections for international participants. \n\nRecommendation 2-3b: Securities regulators and policy makers are encouraged to review the local \npractices if they adopt the international standard documentation such as the GMRA and GMSLA and \nundertake promotionally initiatives if they do not. \n\nc)  Tax and accounting \n\n<Case Study> \n\nIt is important to understand the implications of having manual processes, or of requiring people to \nbe  based  on  the  ground.  Such  manual  process  would  be  a  barrier  even  to  its  own  market.  For \nexample, complexity and uncertainty of tax can be an obstacle and in some instances its mechanism \nof application can prevent participation in the markets and therefore not be revenue generating.   \n\n\uf0d8  APFF has produced repo/lending guide which explore in depth the value and the mechanisms of \nrepo markets including very complex, technical things which are very important to the functioning \nof the markets. \n\n\uf0d8  ABMF has developed Bond Market Guide and have access to tax authority via finance ministry. \n\nRecommendation 2-3c: Responsible authorities are encouraged to supporting constant dialogues \nwith  the  industry  representatives  through  public-private  platforms  including  APFF,  PASLA,  ICMA, \nAsifma, and ABMF to review current policies and practices could effect as a barrier and undertake \nreforms if they do. \n\nd)  Scarcity of HQLA / Expansion of local collateral eligibility requirements \n\nLocal currency collateral, including highly rated government bonds with very little credit risk, is often \nnot commonly accepted in international / foreign markets due either to market custom or the internal \nguidelines  of  key  market  intermediaries;  limiting  the  flow  of  collateral  and  liquidity  in  the  bond \nmarkets.  Barriers  to  cross-border  collateral  flow  due  to  limited  collateral  eligibility  requirements; \nimpact on markets and liquidity; affected market participants. \n\nRecommendation  2-3d:  Responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  collaborate  together  with \ninternational  organizations,  to  have  workshops  to  better  understand  the  issues  to  address  the \ngrowing need for HQLA collateral in the region. Measures could include how local currency assets \ncould  be  utilized  as  part  of  collateral  accepted  for  cross-border  trades  between  financial \nintermediaries  and  CCPs,  how  regional  financial  integration  (including  RTGS-CSD  linkages)  and \nbetter  hedging  markets  would  assist  further  liquidity,  and  identification  of  specific  classes  of \nsecurities  where  liquidity  and  eligibility  could  be  expanded;  followed  by  advocacy  efforts  in \njurisdictions where collateral eligibility could be expanded. \n\n2-4. Increasing Market Efficiency: Issues Specific to Derivatives \n\n                                                   \n3  Even though, less developed markets are affected by the changes in the global markets including Basel \nrules (e.g. Leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, and Net Stable Funding Ratio), and electrification of \ntrading practices (e.g. Automated Request for Quote). \n20 \n\n\f \n \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n- \n\n \n\n \n\nGreater regulatory transparency in the OTC derivative markets is a key public policy goal that was \ncodified  at  the  September  2009  Pittsburgh  G20  summit.  Since  then,  much  work  has  been \nundertaken to achieve this goal, however major questions remain as to whether the mountain of data \nnow being generated is helping to improve regulatory transparency in a meaningful way. Currently, \ndespite seeming progress, major challenges remain: \n\n-  Different,  costly,  duplicative,  conflicting  and  non-standardized  reporting  requirements  across \n\njurisdictions \n\nThe availability of \u2018substituted compliance\u2019 for reporting is limited, adding to duplication \n\n-  Some data requirements are not clearly defined \n- \n-  Standardized reporting formats have been not adopted quickly or broadly enough \n- \n\nThere  is  a  lack  of  agreement  as  to  how  some  data  reporting  requirements  should  be \nstandardized across jurisdictions \n\n-  Regulatory endorsement of standards already in use has been limited \n-  Some reporting regimes are \u2018closed markets\u2019 \u2013 meaning they have their own trade repositories \n\nwhich do not leverage international standards and mechanisms \nLegal barriers exist to sharing data and information, both within and across borders \nTrade repositories have the unenviable task of collecting and standardizing data from multiple \nsources  for  multiple  jurisdictions,  and  have  their  own  unique  data  architectures,  formats  and \nmethods of sharing information \nThere is no facilitator or mechanism to aggregate data from different trade repositories globally \nThere  is  a  lack  of  commitment  among  stakeholders  in  the  process  to  drive  and  achieve \nconsensus in these areas \n\nAs  a  result  of  these  obstacles,  regulators  continue  to  lack  a  true  picture  of  risk  in  individual \njurisdictions because of incomplete and inconsistent trade data. On a global level, this means that \nefforts to aggregate data (and risk exposures) remain little more than a dream. \n\nFortunately, now that major jurisdictions have largely implemented their reporting regimes, national \nregulators  are  increasingly  turning  their  minds  to  cross-border  efforts  to  achieve  regulatory \nconsistency as much as possible. All of these issues have solutions, however they will require the \nactive  support  and cooperation  of  a  range  of global  stakeholders  \u2013  regulators, market  participants \nand infrastructure providers. \n\nThe Roadmap seeks to enable data to be aggregated across jurisdictions, in order for a global data \nset to be realized for what is a global market in nature. In order to achieve this goal, a number of \ncritical  milestones  need  to  be  met:  including  (a)  a  shared,  public  commitment  to  global \nconvergence  on  harmonized  reporting  requirements,  (b)  greater  regulatory  endorsement  of  data \nstandards and formats already in use, (c) the removal of barriers to sharing information across trade \nrepositories  and  borders,  (d)  increased  availability  of  substituted  compliance,  (e)  promotion  of \ninter-operability  and  connectivity  between  trade  repositories,  and  (f)  the  designation  of  leaders  to \ndrive the mechanism for global data aggregation. Their details are as below. \n\nRecommendations 2-4: \n\n        a.  Shared, public commitment to global convergence on harmonised reporting requirements \n\nSecurities  regulators  are  encouraged  to  review  whether  their  reporting  requirements  are \nharmonized,  and  consistent  within  and  across  jurisdictions,  and  undertake  regulatory \nreforms if they are not.   \n\n        b.  Greater regulatory endorsement of data standards and formats already in use \n\nRegulators are encouraged to embrace standards for derivatives reporting, and those that \nhave not yet deployed their rules should avoid introducing unique requirements. \n\n-  Requirements  should  be  as  precise  and  prescriptive  as  possible,  which  will  avoid \n\nambiguity in achieving compliance \n\n-  There should be an effort to perform a robust cost-benefit analysis before requiring a \n\n21 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n- \n\nreporting or disclosure regime.   \nIt  is  also  important  to  espouse  to  the  market  the  additional  benefits  beyond  merely \nsatisfying  compliance  obligations  when  implementing  a  reporting  regime.  Additional \nbenefits  can  accrue,  such  as  being  able  to  enhance  the  transparency  of  pricing,  or \nbeing able to utilize data for internal modeling, either for counterparty or risk or trading \nstrategy purposes. \n\n        c.  The removal of barriers to sharing information across trade repositories and borders   \n\nRegulators are encouraged to review whether current regulations hinder sharing information \nacross borders, and undertake reforms if they do. \n\n        d. \n\nIncreased availability of substituted compliance \nRegulators are strongly encouraged to defer to each other\u2019s regulatory regimes where their \nintended  outcomes  are  consistent  by  adopting  equivalence  decisions,  which  allows  a \nmulti-jurisdictional  reporting  obligation  for  a  transaction  to  be  discharged  once,  in  a \njurisdiction of the reporting entity\u2019s choice. Regulators with a mandate to access the data for \na transaction should obtain that information from that single report.   \n\n        e.  Promotion of inter-operability and connectivity between trade repositories \n\nRegulators are encouraged to review the level of inter-operability between trade repositories \nand promote and incentivise the sharing of data. \n\n        f.  Greater cross-border regulatory focus on global aggregation mechanisms \n\nRegulators  are  encouraged to  leverage  cooperation  with  other  authorities to  achieve  their \nobjectives:  both  for  sharing  lessons  learnt,  as  well  as  sharing  data  by  designating \njurisdictional, regional and global leaders to spearhead the aggregation effort. \n-  Removal of barriers to sharing data & information between regulators \n\n \n\nThese  objectives  cannot  be  achieved  at  the  individual  jurisdiction  level,  and  require  global \ncollaboration,  coordination  and  engagement.  The  active  support  and  cooperation  of  a  range  of \nstakeholders  \u2013  regulators,  market  participants  and  infrastructure  providers  \u2013  is  vitally  important  to \nmaking  this  a  reality.  Only  through  implementing  the  above  measures  can  be  the  goal  of \ntransparency truly be achieved \n\n2-5. Fund Services \n\na)  Regulatory transparency \n\nIn an era where more investors are investing for retirement income and can benefit from the diversity \nof  funds  offered  by  fund  passport  initiatives  like  the  Asia  Region  Funds  Passport,  managing  the \nindustry costs is important to facilitate these investors\u2019 activities. In those economy currently relying \non email or other manual process, a regulator-supported funds back-office processing utility can take \nthe  form  of  a  centralized  digital  network  that  connects  the  fund  industry\u2019s  participants  for  more \neffective  electronic  exchange  of  information.  It  can  improve  industry  cost  efficiency  and  reduce \noperational risks to benefit asset managers and their investors. For cross-border fund investments, \ninteroperability  among  such  utilities  can  facilitate  the  industry\u2019s  more  effective  compliance  on \nreporting  and  investor  transparency  regulatory  needs.  Additionally,  barriers  to  fund  passport \nparticipation  can  be  lowered  due  to  the  reduction  of  administration,  operational  and  regulatory \nreporting complexities - and thus, contribute to the investment fund industry\u2019s development. \n\n<Case Study> \n\n\uf0d8  Common regulatory arrangements for fund passport regimes such as the ASEAN CIS, \n\nChina-HK MRF, APEC ARFP, etc.   \n \n\n22 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nRecommendation  2-5a:  Based  on  the  ASEAN  CIS  experience,  securities  regulators  are \nencouraged  to  set  highly  standardized  registration  process  for  funds  between  passporting \neconomies,  in  order  to  ensure  that  benefits  of  streamlined  regulations  are  felt  by  the  market.  The \ncase of China-HK MRF shows that attractiveness of the product is key in promoting passport scheme, \nand that large-scale funding for pilot funds received a lot of attention from the industry.   \n\nb)  Standardization and harmonization \n\nStandardization  between  business  processes  will  be  essential for  the  automation  and  efficiency of \nfund  services.  Fund  services  are  especially  highlighted  for  cross-border  trading,  because  fund \noperators,  distributors,  registrars,  administrators,  and  custodians  located  in  different  jurisdictions \nhave to seamlessly connect their line of services without compromising the product\u2019s attractiveness. \n\nthe  call \n\nto  better  understand  different \n\nthe  region  and  develop \nAmid \nrecommendations  for  standardized  practices,  a  consultative  body  of  CSDs  was  established  under \nthe name of Asia Fund Standardization Forum (AFSF) in 2015. However, it will be important to note \nthat  standardization  activities  will  only  have  meaningful  impact  if  industry-wide  implementation  is \nencouraged  on  the  regional  scale,  as  failure  to  do  so  will  result  in  a  development  of  multiple \nstandards that are not harmonized. \n\nfund  services \n\nin \n\n<Case Study> \n\n\uf0d8  Establishment and activities of the AFSF \n\nRecommendation  2-5b:  Responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  support  for  the  activities  of \nAFSF. Harmonization can be achieved in many parts of the business process (usage of same fund \ncodes or message formats, required information for fund products by regulators or market players, \naccount  opening forms, KYC  process,  etc.)  Standardization  in  the  terminology  used  between fund \nmarkets will be essential for market players to communicate effectively for cross-border transactions.     \n\nc)  Infrastructure inter-operability \n\nFund services are an integral part of the investment fund business as an infrastructure that supports \nback-office  processing  and  execution  of  order,  and  their  service  scope  encompass  account \nownership  management,  order  routing,  trade  confirmation,  corporate  action,  fund  balance \nrecord-keeping, and settlement. The importance of fund services is accentuated when fund markets \nmature, as the plateauing of revenue growth from asset management urge companies to turn their \nattention to margin protection, efficiency, and speed. Although fund services conventionally relied on \nmanual intervention, they are moving towards automation and STP, which can promote economies of \nscale, scalability and inter-operability.   \n\nDespite  the  need  to  integrate  fund  services  for  cross-border  flows,  efforts  are  often  hindered  by \nvastly  disparate  practices,  absence  of  a  market  standard  and  prevalence  of  proprietary  systems \nfound  across  the  region.  In  this  regards,  an  interesting  solution  surfacing  is  the  adoption  of \ncentralized  fund  hubs  that  interconnects  the  domestic  market,  streamlining  the  many-to-many \ncommunication between diverse players. As is often the case, CSDs are in a good position to invest \nin  infrastructure  projects  for  the  entire  market,  providing  a  level-playing  field  for  large  asset \nmanagement companies and SMEs alike. In the longer term, such local platforms can help increase \ninvestors\u2019 access to less globalized markets and open the door for service linkage between multiple \nmarkets, thereby accelerating fund market integration. \n\n<Case Study> \n\n\uf0d8  Centralized  fund  platforms  in  Asia  (Korea:  FundNet,  Taiwan:  FundClear,  Indonesia: \n\nS-INVEST, Thailand: FundConnext, etc.).   \n\n\uf0d8  Korea: A centralized digital network called the FundNet was developed by the KSD in \n2004,  linking  every  fund  market  player  in  Korea.  Market  players  can  send  trade/ \n\n23 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsettlement orders by logging into the FundNet interface, which sends the information to \nall relevant parties on STP technology without having to rely on manual methods. Vastly \nimproved  operational  efficiency  has  driven  market  development  and  daily  operating \nvolume for the fund business has jumped by 17 times from 2005 to 2016, from 0.14mn \nto  2.6mn  trade  messages.  Cost  saving  effect  in  the  industry  due  to  FundNet  is \nestimated to be USD 67mn per year (KPMG Strategic Consulting Group, Dec.2013).   \n\n\uf0d8  Thailand: Faced with the challenges of excessive manual processes and spaghetti-like \nconnection  between  market  players,  the  SET  developed  a  platform  called  the \nFundConnext  in  1Q  2017  to  drive  industry  development.  As  an  outcome  of  close \ncollaboration  with  the  regulator  and  industry  members,  FundConnext  standardizes \nmany aspects of business practices in the Thai fund market, including account opening, \nKYC, and NAV disclosure, and facilitates the STP messaging between market players.   \n\nRecommendation  2-5c:  Regulators  are  encouraged  to  support  for  the  development  of  fund \nplatforms led by infrastructure providers. The recent case of Thailand\u2019s platform is a good illustration \nof constructive cooperation between the regulator, CSD, and the market.   \n\nd)  Comprehensive statutory understanding \n\nWhen financial market infrastructure projects are envisaged, they need to have commercial viability. \nWhere the retail market is involved, there needs to be continued focus on investor education and to \nprovide investors with sufficient transparency to make informed decisions \n\nThere also should be provisions for the instances where the mechanisms do not work as planned. \nFor  example,  there  must  be  a  clear,  well-defined  dispute  mechanism  \u2013  which,  for  example  in  the \ncross-border context, might include using an agent. All infrastructure projects should be run with an \nentrepreneurial spirit \n\n \n\n24 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n3.  APEC Roadmap on Data Management and Technology \n\n3-1. FMI Fintech \n\nIn the coming year, APFF FMI Fintech Substream will continue its focus on defining best practices \nand laying the groundwork for capacity building in three areas identified by the group in the APFF \n2016 Progress Report, namely Know Your Customer (KYC), E-Payments, and Cybersecurity.   \n\na)  Know Your Customer \n\nIdentity is a baseline for participation in the formal financial system. Approximately, 1.5 billion people \naround the world do not have an officially recognized document to prove their identity; many of whom \nlive in emerging markets in across  APEC.  A government-issued ID  is  often  essential for  people to \nbank and transact \u2013 but biometrics, mobile phones, and data enable new ways to open up access \nand participation.   \n\nClassical  forms  of  identity  provisioning  struggle  to  reach  underserved  populations,  contain  clear \nsecurity  vulnerabilities,  and  cannot  be  verified  remotely.  Several  governments  across  APEC  and \nother  regions  are  piloting  digital  identity  programs  that  would  provision  a  digital  identity  credential \nthat can be linked to biometrics. These digital ID platforms are scalable, as the information does not \nrequire a physical card or even physical presence to be provisioned and utilized.     \n\nDigital  IDs  can  be  linked  with  electronic  forms  of  know-your-customer  (e-KYC)  verification \nmechanisms.  A  secure  Digital  ID  Application  Programming  Interface  (API)  enables  private  sector \nentities to match identity data they have against the government database; enabling a seamless and \ninstantaneous  know-your-customer  process.  These  remote  instantaneous  verification  procedures \ncould enable financial services (alongside several other services) to be delivered on a far broader \nscale an in a more efficient manner to promoted economic development in the APEC region.     \n\nRecommendation  3-1a:  APEC  Finance  Ministers  and  responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to \nsupport for the following initiatives of APFF FMI Fintech Substream; \n\n-  Conducting  a  review  of  the  current  Digital  ID  and  e-KYC  initiatives  being  rolled  out  in  several \n\nAPEC member economies \n\n-  Analyzing Digital ID and e-KYC initiatives being conducted outside the region to document best \n\npractices that could be leveraged within the APEC region \n\n- \n\nFocusing  its  analysis  on  solutions  that  are  interoperable  at  least,  and  harmonized  at  best,  in \norder  to  promote  economic  integration  among  APEC  member  economies  in  Fintech  KYC \ndevelopments \n\no  For example, the APEC Travel Card could be looked at as an example of a regional identity \n\ncredential that could be replicated in the Digital ID context \n\nb) E-Payments \n\nPayments  form  the  core  of  the  financial  services  ecosystem.  People,  regardless  of  income  level, \nlocation, and education, engage in payments transactions.    Currently, 85% of the world\u2019s payments \ntransactions  occur  in  cash.  In  certain  parts  of  Europe,  however,  more  than  85%  of  payments \ntransactions  are  electronic.  Electronic  payments  (e-Payments)  help  to  lower  transaction  costs, \nincrease transparency, and make transfers of money faster and more efficient. Consequently, APEC \nmember economies would benefit tremendously from further digitizing cash payments.     \n\nPayment card solutions are rapidly proliferating throughout the APEC region and the mobile smart \nphone is also being leveraged to move APEC economies towards a cashless society. There are over \n5  billion  mobile  devices  in  the  hands  of  consumers  around  the  world.  New  electronic  payment \nsolutions  that  leverage  the  mobile  device  are  being  rapidly  developed.  The  inter-operability  and \nregulatory requirements associated with these new solutions is currently a challenge for the APEC \n25 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\necosystem that APFF FMI Fintech Substream can help to address.     \n\nThere  are  a  multitude  of  players  currently  introducing  solutions  for  electronic  payments  including \ngovernments, banks, card networks, mobile operators, and pure technology companies. There is a \ndivergence between e-Payments solutions that leverage telephone networks and those that leverage \nthe Internet. There are also divergent standards for payment solutions leveraging the mobile phone \nitself.    Finally,  there  are  differences  in  how  mobile  and  card  based  solutions  interact.  From  a \nregulatory perspective, some e-Payments solutions serve as a pass through for traditional payments \nrails,  other  payments  solutions  store  value,  while  still  others  operate  outside  of  the  traditional \necosystem. Each of these solutions pose different regulatory and consumer risks for APEC member \neconomies.   \n\nRecommendation  3-1b:  APEC  Finance  Ministers  and  responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to \nsupport for the following initiatives of APFF FMI Fintech Substream; \n\n-  Exploring  whether  there  are  inter-operability  concerns  that  exist  in  the  APEC  e-Payments \necosystem and whether APFF can make recommendations on how to resolve those concerns \n\n-  Seeking to create a primer on e-Payments in the region \n\no  Seeking  to  diagram  the  e-Payments  landscape  so  that  the  multitude  of  actors,  solutions, \n\nand risks across the APEC region is more easily understood \n\no  Creating  a  set  of  definitions  to  help  guide  policymakers  in  understanding  the  e-Payments \n\nlandscape \n\no  Making  recommendations  on  regulatory  frameworks  for  e-Payment  solutions  based  upon \nthe  varying  risks  that  they  pose,  with  the  best  possible  accounting  for  varying  market \nconditions in APEC member economies \n\nc) Cybersecurity \n\nThe digitization of financial services is coupled with the onset of new cyber-risks. Securing against \nthose  risks  should  be  the  goal  of  both  the  public  and  private  sector  in  APEC.  Issues  related  to \ncybersecurity extend beyond Fintech. Therefore, the FMI Fintech Substream will coordinate its work \nwith the perspectives from Disruptive Technologies / new FMI-like entities. The risks associated with \ncybersecurity  are  not  well  or  uniformly  understood  by  policymakers  across  the  APEC  region.  The \nsolutions to these new risks can be equally challenging to comprehend. Moreover, the role of policy \nand  regulation  for  APEC  member  economies  in  cybersecurity  is  a  tremendous  challenge  as \ntechnology  shifts  rapidly  and  fixed  regulatory  requirements  might  lead  bad  actors  to  attack \nvulnerabilities that were not within the purview of specific regulation.     \n\nThe  major  vulnerability  associated  with  Fintech  is  the  multitude  of  new  actors  it  brings  into  the \nfinancial services ecosystem and the linkages created between these new actors and in some cases \ntheir  interaction  with  established  financial  institutions  and  systems  in  APEC.  Fintech  technologies \nsuch as tokenization, however, limit the cyber risks of these new actors by encrypting transactions \nand  only  passing  along  tokens  instead  of  actual  financial  information.  The  password  is  another \nsecurity vulnerability that has been proliferated by Fintech, creating opportunity for cyber-criminals to \nseek password credentials to take over accounts. At the same time, new Fintech solutions such as \nbiometric  and  multi-factor  authentication  are  helping  enhance  security  by  reducing  reliance  on \npasswords.     \n\nA  cybersecurity  ecosystem  for  APEC  can  only  be  as  strong  as  its  weakest  link.  And,  that  is  why \npolicymakers in APEC are interested in creating baseline cybersecurity requirements for participants \nin the Fintech ecosystem. The challenge with this approach, however, is that by setting a baseline for \ncybersecurity,  APEC  policymakers  risk  encouraging  complacency  in  the  ecosystem.  Moreover, \nsetting a baseline for cybersecurity among APEC member economies also risks highlighting for bad \nactors where the vulnerabilities lie. Policymakers must utilize more dynamic and flexible regulatory \n26 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\nframeworks  when  approaching  Fintech  cybersecurity  that  will  best  protect  the  ecosystem  in  the \nAPEC region.     \n\nRecommendation  3-1c:  APEC  Finance  Ministers  and  responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to \nsupport for the following initiatives of APFF FMI Fintech Substream; \n\n-  Creating a typology of cybersecurity risks in the fintech ecosystem \n\n-  Engaging  in  research  and  analysis  of  emerging  cybersecurity  solutions  and  share  those \n\nlearnings with stakeholders \n\n-  At public-private forums discuss its findings on cybersecurity risks and solutions and advocate \nhow  identified  best  practices  can  be  adopted  throughout  the  APEC  ecosystem,  without \nregulatory technology mandates wherever possible \n\n3-2. Disruptive Technologies / new FMI-like entities \n\nNew  so-called  disruptive \nfinancial  market \ninfrastructures  and  market  participants  to  operate  more  efficiently,  better  service  public  and  private \nsectors, increase and simplify access to financial data and products.   \n\ntremendous  opportunities \n\ntechnologies  provide \n\nfor \n\nDisruptive  technologies  such  as  distributed  ledger  technologies,  robot-advisers  or  artificial  intelligence \nbring promises of better data management, faster access to data and cost reduction for the usage of that \ninformation for the benefits of a growing financial product customer base through digitization.   \n\nThese new technologies however also bring risks such as: \n\n\uf0d8 \n\uf0d8 \n\ntechnological and operational risks due to their lack of maturity,   \nfragmentation risks due to a lack of technical and data standardization for mainstream \nand cross-border usage,   \n\n\uf0d8  cybersecurity and data confidentiality risks,   \n\uf0d8 \n\nlegal risks considering the existing regulatory uncertainty around their use, especially for \ncross-border  activities,  and  the  legal  protections  that  are  available  (particularly  in  a \nconsumer context). \n\n \n\nRecommendation  3-2a:  Financial  Market  Infrastructures  should  experiment  and  contribute  to  the \nresearch  and  development  exercise  required  to  overcome  the  maturity  challenge.  They  should  work \ncollaboratively  with  regulators,  the  financial  industry  and  the  broader  public  sector.  Such  collaborative \nexperimentation  is  important  not  only  to  contribute  to  maturing  these  technologies  further  but  also  to \nbetter  understand  them,  ensure  focus  on  the  right  problems  to  be  solved  and  identify  as  well  as \nunderstand  the  risks.  It  also  helps  getting  the  necessary  buy-in  for  when  an  implementation  decision \nneeds to be taken. \n\nRecommendation  3-2b:  Regulators  and  FMIs  also  need  to  collaborate  across  markets  to  agree  on \nharmonized  domestic  legal  frameworks  supporting  the  implementation  of  such  new  technologies  and \nensure cross-border regulatory certainty. \n\nStandardization,  both  at  technical  and  business  data  level,  needs  to  be  considered  from  the  start  to \nensure  inter-operability  both  at  domestic  and  cross-border  level,  inter-operability  between  other \nimplementations  as  well  as  with \nlegacy  systems  and  processes  who  will  not  disappear \novernight. Leveraging existing reference data standards (Legal Entity Identifier, ISIN, etc.) and business \nstandards  such  as  ISO  20022,  but  also  supporting  collaborative  open  source  initiatives  such  as the \nHyperledger project, should be utilized rather than reinventing the wheel. \n\nIn this context, Cyber security will also need to be considered from the outset where collaboration will also \nbe needed. Leveraging new technologies around fraud identification and attack prevention will also be \ncritical to ensure the most modern and efficient solutions are implemented. \n\n27 \n\n\fIII. \n\nCONCLUDING SUMMARY \n\n(DRAFTING) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n\n\fANNEXES \n\nAttachment  A:  List  of  FMI  Cross  Border  Practice  Roadmap  Core  (large)  group  Institutions  and \nParticipants \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nInstitution\n(abbreviation)\n\nName\n\nTitle\n\nAsian Development Bank\n(ADB)\n\nAsia Facilitators\nAsia Securities Industry &\nFinancial Market\nAssociation (ASIFMA)\nAutoriti Monetari Brunei\nDarussalam\nAustralian APEC Study\nCentre\nAustralian Securities and\nInvestments Commission\n(ASIC)\nBain & Company Southeast\nAsia\n\nBanchile Inversiones\n\nBanco de Chile\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\n\nBankers Association of the\nPhilippines\nBank of Japan\n\nBank of Indonesia\n\nThe Bank of Korea\n\nThe Bank of Lao PDR\n\nThe Bank of Tokyo-\nMitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.\n\nBloomberg\n\nBolsa de Santiago\n\nBolsa de Valores de\nColombia\n\nBureau of the Treasury\n(Philippines)\n\nJae-Hyun Choi\nTaiji Inui\nShigehito Inukai\nKosintr Puongsophol\nMatthias Schmidt\n\nSatoru Yamadera\n\nRobert Edwards\n\nCSIF Consultant\nABMF Consultant\nABMF Consultant\nFinancial Sector Specialist\nCustody Business Specialist (Consultant)\nDirector, Principal Financial Sector Specialist , Office of the\nDirector General, Sustainable Development & Climate Change\nDepartment\nManaging Director\n\nAshley Lee\n\nManager, Policy and Regulatory Affairs\n\nShaw Fhen Lim\nMd Kamrizan Antin\n\nSenior Manager, Payment & Settlement Systems Unit\nManager, Payment & Settlement Systems Unit\n\nKen Waller\n\nDirector\n\nRhonda Luo\n\nSenior Specialist, Market Infrastructure\n\nThomas Olsen\n\nPartner\n\nHern\u00e1n Arellano Salas\nJos\u00e9 Antonio D\u00edaz\nFrancisco Garces \nBella Santos\nRemedios Macapinlac\nEleanor Turaray\nCesar O.
