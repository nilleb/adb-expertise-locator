Since the global \nfinancial  crisis  (GFC)  where  FMIs  withstood  the  strains  of  extreme  volatility  and  volume,  the \nimportance of FMI and the reinforcement of their robustness have risen to the fore of policy and \nregulatory considerations that is best represented by the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for FMIs. In recent \nyears, FMIs are increasingly also taking on new roles as the global regulatory agenda promotes \ngreater transparency of transactions and greater standardization of financial products among others. \nFMIs continue to stand as a bulwark against market disruptions. \nIn 2015, the APEC Finance Ministers called for a roadmap to improve the region\u2019s FMIs and create a \nregional securities investment ecosystem to facilitate cross-border investment in capital markets to \ndeepen markets and increase economics of scale. This task was incorporated in the Cebu Action \nPlan, the Finance Ministers\u2019 multi-year blueprint for financial sector development in APEC. The \nAsia-Pacific Financial Forum (APFF), a platform for collaboration among the public and private \nsectors and multilateral and academic institutions to accelerate the development and integration of \nthe region\u2019s financial markets and services launched by the Ministers in 2013, is supporting this effort. \nUsing the APFF platform, this symposium was hosted by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) in \nSeoul, Korea on 25th April 2017. The followings is a summary of its key outcomes. \nFMIs serve to facilitate the efficient and cost-effective flow of investment across markets, support \nfinancial market stability and integrity, and promote greater financial inclusion, fair and equitable \ncompetition and innovation. Historically, these were seen as nodes that accumulated market, liquidity \nand counterparty risks to facilitate transparency and management. Without appropriate oversight \nthey can also become a significant source of systemic risk, especially during times of market stress, \nhence came to be regulated2.  \nSince the GFC of 2007/08, new complexities and costs have also risen that needs to be better \nunderstood and be better managed for markets to have higher levels of sustainability. For example, \nemerging capital markets can struggle with the tension between business case viability and the need \nfor a Central Counterparty (CCP) for nascent derivatives markets to avoid punitive balance sheet \ncosts for banks operating domestically. On top of the new changes, overseas investors continue to \nbe faced with existing market access and repatriation documentation that can be streamlined, while \nthere are funds post-trade paper-intensive services serve as a contrast to the electronic speed of \ninvestments. Cybersecurity concerns have emerged to add to this complexity.  \nToday, economies will need to consider new issues and needs that can face FMIs and financial \nmarkets, including transparency through a standardized and common platform for trade reporting, \nimproving  coordinated  monitoring  of  markets  through  facilitation  of  cross-border  data  flows, \nstandardization of market practices, account structures, operational and processing models, as well \nas  consistent  tax  treatment  of  domestic  and  cross-border  transactions.  Regulatory  clarity  and \nprivate-public  sector  collaboration  is  key  to  realize  new  value  from  untangling  some  of  these \n                                                   \n1 Traditional Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) encompass a variety of institutions including Real-Time Gross \nSettlement (RTGS) systems, Large Value Payment Systems (LVPS), Automated Clearing Houses (ACHs), Securities \nSettlement Systems (SSSs), Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), Central Counterparties (CCPs) and Trade \nRepositories (TRs). FMIs are central to the clearing and settlement of transactions in the financial markets, the movement \n \nof money and securities, and centrally managing the counterparty risks around the world\n2 To help address the threat of systemic shocks and increase the resilience of FMI, CPSS-IOSCO in 2012, released a \nreport entitled Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (24 Principles). The report contained 24 Principles designed to \nensure a more robust infrastructure for the global financial markets and allow the infrastructure to better withstand financial \nshocks. In the subsequent five years since the publication of the CPSS-IOSCO\u2019s first report, the global financial system is \nmuch stronger and FMI adoption across the global has dramatically increased. \n4 \n ", " \n \ncomplexities, and to address the potential rise of the costs and fragmentation of markets after the \nGFC, enhance liquidity and depth, and lessen the cost of raising funds from international capital \nmarkets.  \n1.  The Roles of Financial Market Infrastructures in the Region \nThe April Seoul\u2019s symposium\u2019s discussions related to regulatory environment covered three key \nareas and recommendations included (1) needs for clear regulatory goals, (2) private-public \nsector  engagements  to  find  optimal  solutions  to  reach  these  goals,  (3)  approaches  that \nincorporate considerations of the potential regulatory effects on emerging capital market and their \ngrowth, and (iv) to expand high quality collaterals to include regional currency assets for the \nregion to mitigate liquidity risk and market risks. These are highlighted as follows: \nThey conveyed the message that a fundamental regulatory tool is cooperation: the intensity \nof  the  relationship  will  depend  on  the  policy  objectives.  It  is  also  very  important  to \nappropriately  understand  and  to  calibrate  the  extraterritorial  implications  of  domestic \nregulations and its potential impacts. It raised a suggestion that regional regulators might \nwant to set out a clear, public, medium-term strategy and their regulatory expectations. \nStandardization should not only be considered in technical terms but also in terms of \nindustry expectations: as an example, harmonization of documentation, issuance rules and \nenhancing transparency of securities and tax rules; including common disclosure language \nor procedures for cross-border investors. The panel encouraged regulatory collaboration \nwith ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) for the Asia region, and for the experiences to \nbe shared with the wider APEC members. \nThere is a need to monitor the extra-territorial effects of post- GFC rules being implemented \nfrom developed economies' in the region and to consider ways to address the effects on \nrelatively smaller economies and their capital markets\u2019 growth. Smaller jurisdictions are \nencouraged to carefully consider the global policies; while they should strive to achieve the \noutcomes that have been internationally agreed to minimize regulatory arbitration, the \ninternational bodies should also understand the domestic balance needed between global \nconsistency and local capital market growth stage. \nParticipants discussed the need to evaluate the requirements for High Quality Liquid Assets \n(HQLA)  and  whether  local  currency  assets  could  be  utilized  collaterals  accepted  in \ninternational trades by financial intermediaries and CCPs. Suggestions were made on a \nfurther need to discuss how regional financial integration, including RTGS-CSD linkages \nand hedging, would assist further liquidity and eligibility of local currency assets. \nWhile regional initiatives including access programs and activities to gain inter-operability of \nthe markets, there could be rise of systemic risk from becoming more interconnected \nmarkets,  which  would  pose  threat  especially  in  smaller  economies.  Adoption  is  best \nfacilitated by better insights and knowledge and hence, a recommendation was made to \nevaluate the potential effects of interconnectedness among the markets of different maturity \nstages in the region, possible implications to policy makers and regulators, likely measures \nthat can mitigate identified risks that are also cost and implementation efficient. \n2.  APEC Roadmap on Financial Market Infrastructures: Process and Instruments \nDriven  by  over  a  decade  of  global  and  country-level  new  regulatory  requirements  and \nimplementations, financial markets\u2019 evolution and progress, anecdotally, there is a significantly \nheightened level of post-trade operational running costs and complexities that are in addition to \nlegacy ones. The symposium had highlighted concerns that if these costs and complexities \ncontinue to accumulate, they can eventually become significant drain on market participants\u2019 \ngrowth-oriented  investments.  Hence,  after  the  regulatory  discussions,  the  symposium  then \nmoved to discuss specific areas of the capital markets that can benefit from regulatory attention \n5 \n ", " \n \nto alleviate the operational and compliance complexities that have arose: \n2-1.  Securities Markets: Post-Trade Ecosystem \nThis  panel  brought  together  a  holistic  view  \u2013  from  representatives  of  FMI,  a  market \nintermediary and a multilateral body \u2013 on the state of the securities post-trade ecosystem. \nProgress,  challenges  were  highlighted  and  four  recommendations  were  made.  The \nrecommendations are: \na.  Public-private  platforms  are  encouraged  to  establish  a  baseline  measure  of  the \nmagnitude of costs and complexities in the regional cross-border post-trade securities \necosystem including fund services if possible;  \nb.  in cross-border market access and repatriation activities that investors will need to \nnavigate  to  invest  into  the  region,  to  host  private-public  sector  discussions  to \nunderstand regulatory goals and discuss how these goals can be better achieved and in \nwhat time frame;  \nc.  to identify and agree on specific areas related in the market access and repatriation \ncycle that can benefit from standardization and the use of 3rd party industry utilities; and \nlastly,  \nd.  to clarify regulatory expectations for possible solutions like industry utilities that can \nalleviate complexity but which can attract new regulatory requirements. \n2-2.  Non-Resident Accounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency \nThis panel spoke about on the topic of \u201caccount structure\u201d in the context of cross-border \ninvestments and covered various stages of intermediation. The account structure (omnibus \nor direct holding under the beneficial owner name), is often determined by macroprudential \nconsiderations  related  to  management;  cross-border  tax,  transparency,  reporting  and \noperational requirements. It concluded that while no change is needed to the way local \nparticipants operate in their market which could be direct holding, omnibus or a mix of both, \nthe omnibus account structure is the preferred option for cross-border flows to attract foreign \ninvestments to a local market. Ideally the omnibus account structure should be combined \nwith the nominee legal structure to ensure optimal asset protection. The recommendations \nmade are: \na.  In the region, there is a need to define the appropriate balance between transparency \nand market efficiency. Ensure disclosure requests are supported by the laws of the \ncountry or the bond prospectus. Transparency requirements on different asset classes \n(equities, deposits, government securities, corporate bonds, etc) should be reviewed by \nasset class and treated differently as they can be processed differently. \nb.  Authorities are encouraged to consider the comprehensive statutory framework, and \ncrucially this includes tax implications. While most mature markets do not levy tax on \nfixed income instruments, it remains each country sovereign decision to levy tax or not \nbut it should ideally be considered from (1) an economical perspective and (2) from an \noperational perspective. The easier the process the more efficient the market. \n2-3.  Increasing Market Efficiency: Issues specific to Repo/Lending \nLiquid and well-functioning repo and securities lending markets are essential to the efficient \nallocation and movement of capital and collateral through the financial system. They also \nplay  a  role  to  help  diversify  risk  among  different  types  of  market  participants  across \neconomies.  \nThe relatively diverse range of Asia-Pacific markets\u2019 growth stages give rise to additional \nregional issues and challenges in developing consistent practices. Authorities, together with \nmarket practitioners and wide variety of stakeholders including multi-lateral institutions, need \nto  review  and  where  appropriate,  promote  a  roadmap  that  can  lead  to  adoptions  of \n6 \n ", " \n \ninternational documentation such as the GMRA and GMSLA. \n \n2-4.  Increasing Market Efficiency: Issues specific to Derivatives \nGreater regulatory transparency in the OTC derivative markets is a key public policy goal \nthat was codified at the September 2009 Pittsburgh G20 summit. In order to help improve \nthe regulatory transparency, a number of critical milestones need to be met which includes: \n(a)  a  shared,  public  commitment  to  global  convergence  on  harmonised  reporting \nrequirements, (b) data standards and formats, greater regulatory endorsement of existing \nstandards that can meet desired outcomes, (c) practical ways to share select information \nacross trade repositories and borders, (d) increased availability of substituted compliance, \n(e) promote of inter-operability and connectivity between trade repositories, and (f) the \ndesignation of leaders to drive the mechanism for global data aggregation.  \nThe  active  support  and  cooperation  of  a  range  of  stakeholders  \u2013  regulators,  market \nparticipants and infrastructure providers will be required. \n2-5.  Fund Services \nIn an era where more investors are investing for retirement income and can benefit from the \ndiversity of funds offered by fund passport initiatives like the Asia Region Funds Passport, \nmanaging the industry costs is important to facilitate these investors\u2019 activities. Automation \nis also required to bridge the \u201cmismatch\u201d between the high level of post-investment paper \nand inefficient spaghetti processes and the speed of electronic investments. \nA regulator-supported funds back-office processing utility will be needed to progress this key \nindustry  that  can  support  individuals\u2019  wealth  management,  pension  accumulation  and \ndrawdown \u2013 in the later cases, reduction of unnecessary costs to preserve returns will be \nvery important.  \nIndustry utilities can facilitate these goals and can take the form of a centralized digital \nnetwork that connects the fund industry\u2019s participants for more effective electronic exchange \nof information rather than via email or other manual processes. In order to promote the \ngrowth of portfolio investments in the form of funds among the region, support for the \nactivities of public-private platform including Asian Fund Standardization Forum (AFSF). \n3.  APEC Roadmap on Data Management and Technology  \nFinancial technologies, or Fintech are rapidly changing the shape of how financial services are \ndelivered to clients as well as managed by institutions and monitored as a whole financial market. \nHence, the symposium has been co-organized with FMI Fintech Substream. \n3-1.  FMI Fintech \nFMI Fintech work stream have been discussing on Know-Your-Customer, E-Payments, and \nCybersecurity in the multi-year initiative. Identity is a baseline for participation in the formal \nfinancial  system.  However  classical  forms  of  identity  provisioning  struggle  to  reach \nunderserved  populations,  contain  clear  security  vulnerabilities,  and  cannot  be  verified \nremotely. Digital IDs can be linked with electronic forms of know-your-customer (e-KYC) \nverification  mechanisms.  Therefore  Digital  IDs  and  e-KYC  initiatives  being  conducted \noutside the region need to be analyzed to document best practices that could be leveraged \nbased on the review of such initiatives within the APEC region. \nPayments form the core of the financial services ecosystem. There are a multitude of \nplayers  currently  introducing  solutions  for  electronic  payments  including  governments, \nbanks, card networks, mobile operators, and pure technology companies. APEC economies \nneed  to  explore  whether  there  are  inter-operability  concerns  that  exist  in  the  APEC \n7 \n ", " \n \ne-Payments ecosystem and whether APFF can make recommendations on how to resolve \nthose concerns. \nThe digitization of financial services is coupled with the onset of new cyber-risks. The major \nvulnerability associated with Fintech is the multitude of new actors it brings into the financial \nservices ecosystem and the linkages created between these new actors and in some cases \ntheir  interaction  with  established  financial  institutions  and  systems  in  APEC.  APEC \neconomies are encouraged to engage in research and analysis of emerging cybersecurity \nsolutions and share those learnings with stakeholders.  \n3-2.  Disruptive technologies / new FMI-like entities  \nExamples  of  \u201cDisruptive\u201d  technologies  include  distributed  ledger  technologies, \nrobot-advisers or artificial intelligence bring new business models that leverages on better \ndata management, faster access to data, machine learning and new paradigms represented \nby the decentralized nature of blockchain. The new business models when these new \ntechnologies intersect with financial services can create new potential risks and costs even \nas they would create new value. \nAs such, the panel urged FMIs and the private sector to continue experimenting and \ncontributing to industry\u2019s awareness and knowledge to overcome the maturity challenge. \nCollaborative work with regulators will bridge the gaps with the needs for new regulatory \nframeworks.  \nOver time, regulators, private sector and FMIs should also plan to collaborate across \nmarkets to agree on harmonized domestic legal frameworks supporting the implementation \nof such new technologies and ensure cross-border regulatory certainty. \nWhere  appropriate,  Standardization  at  technical  and  business  data  level  needs  to  be \nconsidered from the start to ensure inter-operability at domestic and cross-border levels. \nInter-operability  between  other  implementations  as  well  as  with  legacy  systems  and \nprocesses who will not disappear overnight.  Leveraging existing reference data standards \n(Legal Entity Identifier, ISIN, etc.) and business standards such as ISO 20022, but also \nsupporting collaborative open source initiatives such as the Hyperledger project, should be \nconsidered to avoid \u201creinventing the wheel\u201d.  \nThere is a greater challenge on the industry to recognize when current standards become \nobsolete, and \u201copen minds\u201d should be adopted for new practices and requirements of future \ntechnologies and their applications least their growth potentials are inhibited as a result of \nill-fitting legacy standards. \nAuthorities should also assess the interaction of financial regulation with other statutes, such as \nfiscal policy or data privacy provisions, and consider the overall impact to the industry. Authorities \nneed to account for the industry\u2019s capacity i.e. available resources to innovate and execute on those \ninnovations. \nSymposium participants shared the above perspectives and issues to be addressed to improve the \nregion\u2019s FMIs and financial markets and then to facilitate cross-border portfolio investments in the \nregion. As post-GFC rules currently in the stages of implementation and new technologies are rapidly \nintroduced to various financial markets, requirements are moving. Regulations and conditions need \nto adapt in a timely manner to support the growth and manage risks. Most recommendations \npresented in this report are suggested to being considered immediately or within two to three years, \nas crucial window for market development and to be benefitted from a coordinated policy effort. \nAt the same time, participants also recognized the diverse maturity of developing stages of the \ncapital markets in the APEC economies, which means that one-size approach will not fit all.  \nThe industry tables these feedback and recommendations for considerations and endorsement by \n8 \n ", " \n \nthe APEC Finance Ministers Process.  \n \nAsia-Pacific Financial Forum \nDEVELOPING APEC\u2019S FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE \n \nConference report \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nOver the past few years, various initiatives have been launched to address this issue. In 2015, the \nAPEC Finance Ministers sought to give impetus to this effort by calling for a roadmap to improve the \nregion\u2019s  FMIs  and  create  a regional  securities  investment  ecosystem  to facilitate  cross-border \ninvestment in capital markets. This task was incorporated in the Cebu Action Plan, the Finance \nMinisters\u2019 multi-year blueprint for financial sector development in APEC. The Asia-Pacific Financial \nForum (APFF), a platform for collaboration among the public and private sectors and multilateral and \nacademic institutions to accelerate the development and integration of the region\u2019s financial markets \nand services launched by the Ministers in 2013, is supporting this effort. \nThe symposium was co-organized by ABAC through APFF FMI Cross Border Practice and FMI \nFintech, and hosted by the Federation of Korean Industries at FKI Conference Center in Seoul Korea \non 25th April, 2017. Over sixty participants representing wide spectrum of organizations in the \nregion\u2019s  public  and  private  sectors  as  well  as  international  institutions,  Financial  Market \nInfrastructures and academic and research institutions attended the event. \nParticipants discussed the state and challenges of Asia Pacific financial markets in the regulatory \nenvironment  post  financial  crisis.  The  financial  markets  are  becoming  better  connected  with \ntechnology  and  there  are  many  types  of  infrastructures  that  provide  services  to  maintain  the \nconnectivity. We can collectively call these whole financial market infrastructures including various \ntypes of financial intermediaries and service providers, and highlight that historically, regulators saw \npayment, clearing and settlement infrastructures as nodes that accumulate various types of risks and \nhave started to regulate them as Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs).  \nWhile most traditional FMIs serve to facilitate the efficient and cost-effective flow of investment \nacross  markets,  support  financial  market  stability  and  integrity,  and  promote  greater  financial \ninclusion, fair and equitable competition and innovation, they have historically started serving from \ndomestic markets in each economy, and have had financial intermediaries bridging the differences in \nregulations, market practices and tax issues to promote cross-border portfolio trade.  \nThe global financial crisis (GFC) made us realize the importance of transparency, risk mitigation \nmeasures and robust market infrastructures to mitigate systemic risk upon a default of a major \nmarket participant(s). Now developed markets are in a long period of ultra-low interest rates, slowing \ndown the growth in developing and emerging markets.  \nWe need to support the growth of the economies while maintaining stability through enhanced \nefficient functioning of the markets, including promoting the cross-border portfolio investments, \nutilizing local currency assets as eligible financial collateral by both FMIs and bilaterally, maintaining \nand  broadening  access  to  cross-border  money  transfer  mechanisms  providing  the  required \ntransparency  in  affordable  and  meaningful  way,  and  incorporating  innovative  and  potentially \ndisruptive technologies. Economies will need to consider new issues and needs that can face FMIs \nand financial markets, including transparency through a standardized and common platform for trade \nreporting, improving coordinated monitoring of markets through facilitation of cross-border data flows, \nstandardization of market practices, account structures, operational and processing models, as well \nas consistent tax treatment of domestic and cross-border transactions. These measures would help \n9 \n ", " \n \naddress the potential rise of the costs and fragmentation of markets after the GFC, enhance liquidity \nand depth, making sure the smaller players\u2019 involvement, and lessen the cost of raising funds from \ninternational capital markets. By having a platform for the public and private sectors to collaborate, to \nidentify and prioritize the issues to be addressed and reflected on in the Roadmap, we would then \neffectively communicate in the APEC region through the Cebu Action Plan. \nThe discussions in the Seoul symposium together with the preparatory conference calls reflected \nboard support across economies, sectors and institutions including in Latin America for the further \ndevelopment of FMIs in the region. The messages have been discussed further by the public and \nprivate institutions which participated the joint session with ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) in \nManila on 4th July 2017 and obtained broad support. This conference report describes the outcomes \nof these discussions, including the Roadmap for APEC FMIs. \n \nII.  ANALYSES AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \n*For review and comments by officials at the Joint session with ABMF. \n1.  The Roles of Financial Market Infrastructures in the Region \nFinancial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) are central to the clearing and settlement of transactions in \nthe financial markets, the movement of money and securities, and centrally managing counterparty \nrisks around the world. Traditional FMIs include central counterparties (CCPs), central securities \ndepositories (CSDs), payments infrastructure needed for settlement, and trade repositories (TRs). \nFMIs strengthen the markets they serve and promote and enhance financial stability. However, \nwithout appropriate oversight they can also become a significant source of systemic risk, especially \nduring times of market stress. To help address the threat of systemic shocks and increase the \nresilience of FMI, CPSS-IOSCO in 2012, released a report entitled Principles for financial market \ninfrastructures (24 Principles). The report contained 24 Principles designed to ensure a more robust \ninfrastructure for the global financial markets and allow the infrastructure to better withstand financial \nshocks. In the subsequent six years since the publication of the CPSS-IOSCO\u2019s first report, the \nglobal financial system is much stronger and FMI adoption across the globe has dramatically \nincreased. \nFinancial market participants require an open and competitive infrastructure environment which can \ndeliver best-in-class, reliable and cost-effective services that produce lower risk, faster execution, \nand transparent data reporting. The question remains  how these FMIs, together with financial \nintermediaries and fund service participants in the APEC region can best deliver such services. With \ndifferent products covered, investment strategies employed and a wide variety and caliber of trading, \nclearing and settlement venues, the future of FMI in the region remains uncertain. Clear consensus \nexists among market participants and policymakers on the critical importance of central clearing and \nincreased need for transparency. However, a great deal more work remains to be done to achieve \nthe overarching objectives and great promise of robust financial architecture that promotes balanced \nand sustainable growth in the region.  \nA  fundamental  regulatory  tool  is  international  collaboration  and  cooperation.  Working  with  the \nindustry  to  identify  market/systemic  weaknesses  is  encouraged.  It  is  also  very  important  to \nappropriately  calibrate  the  extraterritorial  implications  of  domestic  regulation,  and  its  potential \nnegative impact. Hence, a consultative approach, giving market participants and stakeholders ample \ntime to respond to public consultations on rules and regulations to avoid cross-border conflicts and \nunintended consequences is welcomed. \nRelationships should leverage existing multilateral organizations, but in addition to  \u2013 not as a \nreplacement for \u2013 bilateral relationships. There should be a thorough understanding of the impact \nwhich regulatory changes and infrastructure implementations have on the efficiency of a market \u2013 \nand acknowledgement that the cost of introducing inefficiencies will be avoided by participants \n10 \n ", " \n \nwherever possible, sometimes leading to unintended consequences (such as shifting operations \naway from the jurisdiction or having to compensate investors for the additional operational cost \nthrough increased yields of sovereign issues).  \nThere needs to be a reckoning of the regulatory demands and consideration of adjusting the \nregulatory framework to suit each market. The over-riding regulatory objective should be to foster \nstability and trust in the financial markets, conducting, when appropriate, a cost-benefit analysis for \nnew regulation to assess whether it might harm market development or the economy. Using risk \nbased analysis for adoption of new regulation - how much risk is in the market vs how much \nregulation is being created to address that risk - could be a useful tool to approach the issue. \nThe roles of FMIs have been under the spotlight after the GFC as part of the measures to enhance \nfinancial stability while maintaining the availability of funding channels to support the growth of the \neconomy. While regional cooperative initiatives to promote issuance and liquidity of local currency \nbonds are underway through standardization and harmonization, the effects of G20 regulatory \ninitiatives could impact market participants in other economies in APEC. Responsible authorities and \nprivate sectors together are encouraged to monitor such effects and review regulations and policy \nmeasures to address such issues including a potential scarcity of High Quality Liquid Assets. It is \nalso encouraged to review the effects of interconnectedness as further connectivity among the \nmarkets progresses. \nThe GFC prompted G20 authorities to bring in a new suite of regulations starting with developed \neconomies in North America, Europe and parts of Asia. Those regulations influence markets and \nmarket participants in developing and emerging markets by way of extraterritorial effects, while those \neconomies may bring in similar sets of regulations in their own markets. APEC economies need to \nunderstand  the  effects  of  mandatory  margining  of  non-centrally  cleared  OTC  derivatives,  the \nproblems that creates with definitions of eligible collateral and different economies\u2019 rules. FMIs are \nadjusting to facilitate cross-border collateral transfers through linkages. \nQuestions arose from regulators and policy makers in smaller economies as to whether such \neconomies should be required to establish local central counterparties (CCPs) which accept local \ncurrency  assets  as  eligible  collateral.  Challenges  include  relatively  low  local  currency  trading \nvolumes, leading to questions of how these CCPs would achieve economies of scale and netting \nefficiencies, and whether utilizing CCPs outside of their home economy would be more viable. We \nobserve that some countries outside of APEC have established their own CCPs to keep margin \n(collateral) onshore. Where volumes are sufficient to achieve economies of scale this has worked; in \nother places it has stimulated the development of offshore non-deliverable markets in response to \nhigh clearing fees.  In its 2012 Emerging Markets Derivatives Paper, IOSCO noted that economies \nwith smaller, less developed derivatives markets should consider mandatory OTC margining as an \nalternative to investing in small-scale onshore clearing infrastructure. APEC economies have a \nbreadth of different types of markets. While there has not been discussion to create a regional CCP \nin APEC, as markets grow, such a CCP may be necessary. In this regard, regional discussion to \nshare experiences is encouraged. \nAs we understand that not all OTC derivative transactions are cleared by CCPs, there is also a role \nfor financial intermediaries to manage risk bilaterally, as well as collateral. Policy makers need to \nunderstand the developments on the bilateral front. APEC economies need to identify the issues \napplicable to both the CCP and the bilateral clearing constructs, including segregated third party \ncustodial accounts to manage counterparty risk. Nevertheless, stages of market development in \nAPEC economies vary greatly. The development of FMIs needs to be considered in line with such \nstages. \na)  Standardization and harmonization \nOne of the key tools to bring efficiency to the global markets is to espouse standardization wherever \npracticable. Standardization should not only be considered in technical terms, where it is perhaps \nmore obvious (such as the utilization of ISO20022 for messaging), but  also in terms of industry \n11 \n ", " \n \nexpectations: as an example, harmonizing issuance documents might help both issuers streamline \nmultinational issues and increase investors\u2019 appetite to diversify through cross-border investments.  \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Regional financial integration initiatives are showing how we can prevent fragmentation while \nmaintaining  rapid  growth  in  respective  local  markets.  For  instance,  AMBIF  are  targeting \ninstitutional investors such as financial intermediaries, hence accepting English as the common \ndisclosure language with templates, adhering to international accounting standards, and relaxing \nregulations to incentivise issuers to utilize this platform to obtain finance from regional markets. \nRecommendation 1a: Responsible authorities are encouraged to support the harmonization of \nissuance  rules  and  enhancing  transparency  of  securities  and  tax  rules;  including  targeting \nprofessional investors such as financial intermediaries to enable common disclosure language, \nprocedures investor protection rules. To promote this, it is encouraged to collaborate with ASEAN+3 \nBond Market Forum and then apply the experience gained to wider APEC economies. \nHarmonization can be based on outcomes as well \u2013 for instance, collateral rules can be a powerful \nalternative to clearing mandates where they are impractical or inefficient. Harmonization can also \nhelp drive broader usage of regional assets \u2013 for instance, regional bonds could be used more \nbroadly as collateral instead of US Treasuries which remain the preferred tool. Such regional \nissuances promotion projects should also be supported by central and policy bank practices \u2013 they \nshould, for example, assess the liquidity impact of their collateral practices.  \nb)  Monitoring the effects of G20 regulatory initiatives \nG20 regulatory initiatives post-GFC are affecting not only the developed economies in the world but \nalso developing APEC economies. For example, although promotion of central clearing is the policy \nobjective  of  the  non-centrally  cleared  derivatives  mandatory  margining  regime,  some  APEC \neconomies lack the economies of scale to establish their own CCP, and local currency collateral may \nnot  be  accepted  as  eligible  collateral  at  international  CCPs.    This  is  a  particular  problem for \njurisdictions whose currencies are not freely tradable or convertible. \nThe industry and regulators must acknowledge that in order to be efficient, infrastructures must have \na combination of scale and competition on comparable services; in smaller markets such as those in \nAsia, this might not be achievable and therefore it must be accepted that some infrastructure \nservices might not be best offered onshore. It must be remembered that the purpose of promoting \nthe use of infrastructure is not an end in itself, but rather as a risk mitigation tool \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  For example, forcing clearing of OTC derivatives or the use of listed derivatives for hedging \nthese transactions might force institutions to accept imperfect hedging, therefore shifting the risk \nfrom the financial markets into the real economy. Corporate end users may be denied favorable \nhedge accounting treatment in such circumstances and choose not to hedge as a result.    \nInfrastructures, such as CCPs, not only require scale and significant capital, but also significant \nregulatory oversight \u2013 and implementing regulatory principles remains a challenge. For instance, it \nremains a challenge to finalize recovery and resolution plans for CCPs.  \n \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Policy makers from some emerging APEC economies are considering if they need to establish a \nlocal OTC derivatives CCP in their respective jurisdictions, as most local market participants are \nnot able to post their local currency-denominated assets to major international derivatives CCPs, \nusually due to capital account restrictions. Some economies in APEC are G20 members and \nhence are asked by international regulatory organizations if and when they intend to introduce \ncentral clearing. However smaller economies may find it difficult to achieve economies of scale \nin such CCPs given high cost of establishment, development and maintenance, as well reduced \nnetting efficiencies in a small local currency market. \n12 \n ", " \n \n\uf0d8  Brazil might be a market which has the breadth, depth and financial deepening to provide all \ntypes of hedges to its local banks and corporates, such that they can compete. Domestic \nBrazilian CCPs are interlinked and interoperable, so the pricing and netting benefits accrue to \nusers, who are then able to provide hedges at roughly the same price as an international CCP. \n \nRecommendation 1b: Securities regulators and central banks are encouraged to monitor together \nwith the region's market participants the extraterritorial effects of developed economies' rules and \nconsider ways to address this, especially in smaller economies. Smaller jurisdictions are encouraged \nto carefully consider global policies and their appropriateness for smaller markets. They should strive \nto achieve the outcomes that have been internationally agreed \u2013 but be very mindful of what \nimplementation means for their jurisdiction. In any case, the implementation must avoid creating \nfurther fragmentation.  \nc)  Measuring the scarcity of High Quality Liquid Assets \nPost-GFC regulations and bank prudential rules are forcing financial transactions to be further \ncollateralized.  Even  if  there  was to  be  a  tapering  of this through quantitative  easing  or  other \nmeasures were introduced to increase the stock of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) available to \nthe market, there could be still a scarcity of HQLA collateral to provide enough financing, including in \ndeveloping markets. \nLocal currency collateral, including highly rated government bonds with very little credit risk, is often \nnot commonly accepted in international / foreign markets due either to market custom or the internal \nguidelines of key market intermediaries; limiting the flow of collateral and liquidity in the bond \nmarkets. Barriers to cross-border collateral flow due to limited collateral eligibility requirements; \nimpact on markets and liquidity; affected market participants. \nRecommendation  1c:  Responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  collaborate  together  with \ninternational organizations, to have workshops to better understand the issues to address the \ngrowing need for HQLA collateral in the region. Measures could include how local currency assets \ncould  be  utilized  as  part  of  collateral  accepted  for  cross-border  trades  between  financial \nintermediaries and CCPs, how regional financial integration (including RTGS-CSD linkages) and \nbetter  hedging  markets  would  assist  further  liquidity,  and  identification  of  specific  classes  of \nsecurities  where  liquidity  and  eligibility  could  be  expanded;  followed  by  advocacy  efforts  in \njurisdictions where collateral eligibility could be expanded. \nd)  Infrastructure inter-operability and interconnectedness \nMarket infrastructures, including central banks, should be encouraged to cooperate \u2013 in a similar \nmanner to how central banks already link to each other to allow cross-border DvP settlements. \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  To mitigate settlement risk, CSIF are linking central banks and CSDs to establish the first \ncross-border  DvP  settlements.  While  it  will  consist  of  a  network  of  bilateral  linkages, \nstandardization of technical components will mitigate the risk of becoming a complex network. \nSuch initiatives are leading the way to utilize platforms for local bond markets across the region.  \nWhile regional initiatives include access programs and activities to achieve inter-operability of the \nmarkets, there could be rise of systemic risk from markets becoming more interconnected, which \nmay pose a threat especially in smaller economies. \nRecommendation 1d: Respective authorities are encouraged to promote inter-operability among \nFMIs  and  participants  including  financial  intermediaries,  and  evaluate  the  effects  of \ninterconnectedness between the markets and their potential impact, implications to policy makers \nand regulators, measures to mitigate risk while avoiding \"risk-off\" or hindering financial inclusion. \n   \n13 \n ", " \n \n2.  APEC Roadmap on Financial Market Infrastructures: Process and Instruments \n2-1. Securities Markets: Post-Trade Ecosystem \nThe securities market post-trade ecosystem is a large one and for the purposes of the APFF FMI \nsymposium, we have defined the securities market\u2019s post-trade ecosystem as including   \n\uff081\uff09 Financial  Market  Infrastructures  (FMI);  securities  central  counterparties  (CCP),  central \nsecurities depositories and payments infrastructure needed for settlement, \n\uff082\uff09 Securities  intermediaries  and  messaging  systems  including  custodian  banks  and \nbroker-dealers; and \n\uff083\uff09 Fund services participants including centralized industry fund services platforms, transfer \nagencies and fund administrators. \nDriven  by  over  a  decade  of  global  and  country  level  new  regulatory  requirements  and \nimplementations, financial  markets\u2019  evolution  and  progress,  anecdotally,  there  is  a  significantly \nheightened level of post-trade operational running costs and complexities in the industry that are in \naddition to legacy ones.  \nThe symposium had highlighted concerns that if costs and complexities continue to accumulate, they \ncan eventually become significant drain on participants\u2019 growth-oriented investments. Over time, an \nunintended effect can arise if the industry prioritises scarcer resources into certain areas and divert \nattention  away  from  others  which  can  inhibit  markets\u2019  progress  in  this  area.  Unnecessary \ncomplexities and costs also act as invisible \u201cbehind the border\u201d barriers to cross-border investment \nactivities and well as financial market integration that can improved economies of scale to attract \nactivities.  \nAs a starting point, the potentials to realize cost, compliance and regulatory reporting efficiency \nbenefits can be found in the region\u2019s diverse set of market access and repatriation requirements and \ntheir  inherent  documentary  compliance  and  regulatory  reporting  activities;  for  example,  in  the \nAccount Opening stage of the illustrated market access and repatriation cycle below. Greater \nstandardization and the use of FMI as industry utilities have been highlighted as two possible \nsolutions. In the future, technology or \u201cRegTech\u201d may also play roles to facilitate such efficiency goals. \nThe panel has also voiced the need for private-public sector collaboration to establish shared \nunderstanding of regulatory goals which can lead to better approaches towards compliance. \nEvery financial market will have a set of cross-border market entry and repatriation steps that \nunderpin cross-border investments. The efficiency in fulfilling these steps count towards the market\u2019s \noverall cost, operational complexity level and risk levels \u2013 which is of concern to all participants.  \nThis set of cross-border market entry and repatriation steps generally consists of the following \ni.  New Account Opening \nii.  Market Entry and Capital injection \niii.  FX Execution and Hedging \niv.  Clearing and Settlement \nv.  Asset Servicing or Corporate Actions and Tax \nvi.  Repatriation \nvii.  Reporting \n   \n14 \n ", " \n \nThe following illustration provides a view of the ecosystem. \n \n               Source: Deutsche Bank  \nA cross-border participant will face the costs and complexities that are amplified by the actual \nnumber of activities, the frequency and extent of changes that affect these activities and the number \nof markets that this cross-border participant is vested in.  \nIdeally,  there  can  be  a  review  of  the related post-trade  documentary  and  reporting regulatory \nrequirements to determine which legacy requirements may be retired and which areas can be \nstreamlined and in other cases, to automate using advance technology.  \nTherefore, four recommendations related to cross-border securities post-trade ecosystem were \nmade. They are  \n2-1a.  Public-private  platforms  are  encouraged  to  establish  a  baseline  measure  of  the \nmagnitude of costs and complexities in the cross-border post-trade securities ecosystem \nincluding fund services if possible.  \n2-1b.  In cross-border market access and repatriation activities that investors will need to \nnavigate  to  invest  into  the  region,  to  conduct  private-public  sector  discussions  to \nunderstand regulatory goals and discuss how these goals can be better achieved and in \nwhat time frame. \n2-1c.  To identify and agree on specific areas related in the market access and repatriation \ncycle that can benefit from standardization and the use of 3rd party industry utilities. \n2-1d.  To clarify regulatory expectations for possible solutions like industry utilities that can \nalleviate complexity but which can attract new regulatory requirements. For example, the \nuse  of  industry  utilities  can  be  a  cost-effective  standardization  approach  to  reduce \ndocumentary and reporting complexity. However, its use can involve regulations related \nto 3rd party service providers, recovery and resolution, data protection, outsourcing and \nCloud \u2013 and which can lead to new uncertainties, costs and complexities.  \nA sequencing of the recommendations would be beneficial to build on each step of understanding \nand  momentum.  The  recommendations  here  are  for  the  cross-border  securities  post-trade \n15 \n ", " \n \necosystem. They can be related to some of the recommendations by the Panel on Non-Resident \nAccounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency; and the Panel on Fund Services which is \nsimilarly focused increasing automation to reduce complexity and to support cross-border funds \nactivities. \n \n2-2. Non-Resident Accounts, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency \nAccount structure, Tax, Investor Identification and Transparency are influenced by each market \ndevelopment  history  and  current  level  of  maturity.  There  is  neither  absolute  truth  nor  global \nconsensus but these three matters are discussed around the world due to their importance for \nmarkets\u2019 liquidity and stability. These two elements (liquidity and stability) can be used (among \nothers)  as  measurable  benchmark  to  assess  the  efficiency  of  a  particular  market.  While \nharmonization is a great ambition, it is not an absolute must as any barrier to cross-border flows can \nbe solved unilaterally by the market where the barrier is observed. To achieve harmonization while \nleaving each country managing its own priorities at its own pace, safely and least costly, it is \nrecommended that the responsible authorities should review whether legal/tax frameworks \nsupport international rules and best practices and undertake reforms if they do not. Indeed, \nany domestic investor becomes an international investor as soon as he invests outside of his home \nmarket. \nJurisdictional authorities should clearly articulate their statutory objectives: asset protection, tax \ncollection, market surveillance prior engaging into market reforms touching any of these three \ndimensions. This will allow fair assessment of the assets by foreign investors - which is particularly \nrelevant for some markets in the region. \na)  Account structure \nThree dimensions must be considered when looking at the optimal account structure for a market: \nasset protection, cost and operational efficiency. It is also important to keep in mind that multiple \naccount structures can co-exist in the same market for different asset classes and even for the same \nasset class. Each structure offers different advantages and has limitations. On a pure domestic basis, \nany account structure can be adopted while on a cross-border basis, extra considerations are \nrequired. The objective is to strike the right balance between transparency and operational efficiency \nknowing that market needs can evolve over time together with the market maturity level. \nThe account structure supports the identification of legal ownership and asset protection attached to \nsecurities in case of insolvency of a counterparty, an intermediary or an infrastructure. It is also an \nimportant component of the custody chain which influences market participation, risk mitigation and \nsettlement efficiency. This is further exacerbated on a cross-border basis. \nOn a cross-border basis, empirical evidences show that the omnibus account structure combined \nwith a nominee legal structure is the most effective from an operational viewpoint and is also the \npreferred method of international investors to enter a market. Indeed, opening direct accounts at the \nlevel of the CSD prevents intermediaries to isolate the investors from local complexities. \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Reforms, when introduced, must be reviewed to ensure that they are meeting the intended \nobjectives. For instance, recently an APEC economy has introduced the ability to bulk orders. \nWhile this is a positive development, it does not fundamentally meet the need to have a \n\u2018nominee\u2019 or \u2018omnibus\u2019 account structure.  \n\uf0d8  Equities are traded on an exchange with a high concentration on the main liquidity pool. \nFixed-income is mostly OTC, trading takes place on a decentralized basis, hence the custody \nchain is also decentralized. Korea re-introducing the omnibus account for equities as of March \n6th, 2017. China adopted the omnibus for Stock Connect.  \nIt is important as well that fixed income assets do not grant ownership rights, which has significant \n16 \n ", " \n \npolicy  implications  in  terms  of  national  interest  and  tax  purposes.  When  information  and \ntransparency are required with regards to ownership, disclosure regimes should be preferred over \nsegregated  account  structures;  and  authorities  should  be  aware  of  the  difficulty  of  obtaining \nqualitative data compared to quantitative data. Quantitative data can be in most instances used for \npolicy and monitoring purposes, and the incremental value of the qualitative data for these purposes \noften does not justify the cost of systematic collection. \nIn the context of CCPs regulators looked at the ideal account structure to ensure portability but best \nis to leave the choice to the asset owner. \nRecommendation 2-2a: No need to change the way the local market is operating which could be \n(direct holding, omnibus or a mix of both) but the omnibus is the preferred option for cross-border \nflows to attract foreign investments to a local market. Both account structures can coexist. Ideally the \nomnibus account structure should be combined with the nominee legal structure. \nIn the spirit of reciprocity, jurisdictions should strive to harmonize fiscal treatment across asset \nclasses. In fiscal matters, simplification should be the driving principle. \n \nb)  Tax \nAuthorities are encouraged to consider the comprehensive statutory framework, and crucially this \nincludes tax implications. While most mature markets do not levy tax on fixed income instruments, it \nremains each country sovereign decision to levy tax or not but it should ideally be considered from \n(1) an economical perspective (e.g.: will the tax revenues be offset by an increase of yield) and (2) \nfrom  an  operational  perspective  (e.g.:  is  the  tax  computation  and  collection  processes \noperationally efficient of will they negatively affect the liquidity of the instruments).  \nWhile the economical relevance of the tax can be debated between the Tax authorities and the \nissuers (corporate and debt management office), the operational efficiency is a lower hanging fruit to \ncatch. Indeed, investors can request a yield premium to offset an excessive tax rate but will likely not \ninvest or limit their activity should the operational complexity be too high.  \nWhile \u2018no tax\u2019 is the easiest model to operate, should there be tax levied on fixed-income instruments, \nit is important to consider its extra complexity under a cross-border environment. Typically, tax \nrequiring computation based on price difference (certain capital gain tax or VAT) or holding period are \nthe most complex to operate on a cross-border basis. Processes requiring local notarization, original \ndocuments, and the use of a local agent should be avoided as they bear a heavy cost and add \ncomplexity. \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  A Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) implemented in Scandinavia was reversed when the capital \nmarket liquidity dried completely. The new FTT being discussed in Europe is facing many \nhurdles and could pose a threat to collateral management related transactions which are a major \npillar of liquidity.  \n\uf0d8  Japan changed its tax scheme to get rid of clean and dirty JGBs with the benefits to merge the \ntwo liquidity pools.  \n\uf0d8  China recently confirmed that for CIBM there would be no capital gain and no tax at all for \ngovernment bonds and municipals.  \n\uf0d8  Chinese Taipei simplified the tax scheme for Formosa Bonds in order to attract foreign investors.  \n\uf0d8  Some other APEC economies markets suffer because of their tax complexities. \n \nWithholding tax process can be optimized by preferring a \u201ctax at source\u201d principle. The second best \noption  is  a  \u201cquick  tax  refund\u201d  process  followed  by  a  \u201cstandard  refund\u201d.  The  collection  of  tax \ncertificates to define the tax rate of the investor can also be optimized by preferring a \u201cperpetual\u201d \ncertificate valid until a change occur. The second best option is a recurrent certificate (every X years). \nThe least preferred is a certificate required for each payment. The collect of certificates can be \n17 \n ", " \n \ngreatly facilitated by the intermediaries in the custody chain so it is advisable to leverage them. \nA frequent misgiving is that financial institutions, especially foreign ones, are unwilling to pay taxes; \nin reality, firms seek to have a tax regime that does not impose a significant operational burden and \nthat is predictable enough to permit accurate pricing of the assets.  \nAn ideal tax regime will unlikely be found; however, even imperfect regimes can yield the expected \nlevel of income. Simple regimes can improve fiscal compliance. On the contrary, complex regimes \nwill  increase  the  operational  cost  of  servicing  capital  market  assets.  This  increased  cost  is \nincorporated in the asset valuation, and therefore will increase the interest demanded by investors \non domestic issues including sovereign ones; as a result, it may be that the marginal tax revenue \nbenefit might be erased by the higher yield.  \nThe impact of tax policies on capital market policies must be also well understood. For example, the \nfocus on beneficial ownership in an APEC economy is driven by the wish to broaden the tax base; \nhowever, this has a significant impact on the efficiency of trading. Authorities are encouraged to \nconsidering other implementation options provided there is no overwhelming fiscal leakage.  \nEvidence suggests that beneficial ownership shifts have not been used for tax avoidance; even \nunder the current regime where DTA\u2019s vary and investors might benefit from taking advantage of \nspecific agreements by shifting designated owners just before the record date, there is no indication \nthat they are in fact doing so.  \nIf exemptions are withdrawn, data used for assessment should make use of the existing data pools, \nsuch as the one collected under the OECD Common Reporting Standards \nIn terms of tax principles, it is suggested that authorities avoid transactional taxes, and privilege the \nrecord date principle over the holding period calculation methods.  \nGenerally, taxation should be based on operations based in the jurisdiction. Cross-border capital \ninvestments are not actual operations, and should therefore not be equated to income tax. Removing \nwhat is effectively a transaction tax is not a harmful tax practice. It does not result in \u201cbase erosion \nand profit shifting\u201d. \nRecommendation 2-2b: Prefer no tax or a simple tax scheme (i.e.: a WHT based on a Record Date \nprinciple), no capital gain tax based on a price difference or a tax calculated on a holding period since \nthey are unmanageable on a cross-border basis. Prefer to tax at source instead of refund. For tax \ncertificates collection, prefer a one-time certificate instead of requiring yearly certificate or certificate \nper payment. Do not require local notarization of tax certificates. \nc)  Investor Identification and Transparency  \nThere are multiple reasons why transparency may be desired by issuers, investors, tax authorities \nand/or regulators. Such reasons can be: statistical purpose, price discovery, KYC, AML, quotas, tax, \nmarket surveillance, etc.) \nDifferent asset classes (e.g.: equities, fixed income, investment funds) are traded differently and bear \ndifferent risks (I.e.: equities give an ownership right over a company while bonds only give a mere \nright to an interest without ownership), hence different transparency levels may be relevant and \ndesired for each asset class. Not all instruments are equal, hence should be treated differently. \nTransparency  can  be  achieved  through  multiple  means:  regulators\u2019  bilateral  communication, \nsegregation of accounts at CSD level, use of a unique ID at trading level, trade repository or \ndisclosure reporting. Again, each approach has different merits and some are more suited to certain \nasset classes or for a certain purpose, they can also be combined. \nRecommendation 2-2c: Define the right balance between transparency and market efficiency. \nResponsible authorities should review whether legal frameworks support disclosure requests and \n18 \n ", " \n \nundertake legislative reforms if they do not. Securities regulators should introduce requirements for \nbond prospectuses to facilitate disclosure requests. Upon such review, following perspectives are \nparticularly important: (1) Precise definition of the reason for the transparency to ensure the solution \naddresses  the  needs  and  minimizes  operational  frictions  for  all  involved  parties,  (2)  Ensuring \nenforceability of disclosure in the law to avoid conflicting regulations between the country of issuance \nand the investors\u2019 country of residence, and (3) Avoiding the request of data which cannot be \nautomatically retrieved from intermediaries systems or which require interpretation. \n2-3. Increasing Market Efficiency: Issues Specific to Repo/Lending \nLiquid  and  well-functioning  repo  and  securities  lending  markets  are  essential  to  the  efficient \nallocation and movement of capital and collateral through the financial system. They also play a role \nto help diversify risk among different types of market participants across economies. Many of the \nissues facing Asia-Pacific repo and securities lending markets are common to international markets; \nhowever, the relatively fragmented nature of Asia-Pacific markets, as well as the wide variation in \nlevels of development of domestic markets, give rise to additional regional issues and challenges in \ndeveloping  consistent  practices.  Hence,  responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  review  and \npromote international best practices, promote adoption of standard documentation, review current \npolicies and practices, and discuss expansion of local collateral eligibility requirements to further \npromote movement of capital and collateral while ensuring risk mitigation. \n\u201cImportance of repo/lending that bring the liquidity of overall market\u201d \nRepo/Lending markets bring to securities markets significant benefits: they allow cost reduction, \nimprove  risk  management,  and  bring  liquidity.  Financial  markets  and  public  authorities  are \nencouraged to understand the benefits of short selling: for example, it allows very long term investors \nto maintain their long positions while controlling risk hence influences heavily the appetite for \ninvesting in the market. \nMarket participants have identified several challenges with respect to the repo and securities lending \nmarkets in Asia-Pacific. Policy at the national, regional, and international levels (such as monetary \npolicy, capital account restrictions, or international prudential regulation) can affect the availability \nand liquidity of collateral, especially in the cross-border markets. Collateral eligibility requirements, \nincluding those for local-currency collateral can affect liquidity in the international markets as well. \nShort-selling rules and disclosure regimes can impact the markets as well, in both positive and \nnegative ways. Finally, collateral and inventory optimization is a major concern for direct market \nparticipants, especially those with a need to dynamically manage a range of types of collateral \nacross markets and entities. \nFortunately, both policymakers and market participants continue to pursue various initiatives to \nfurther develop and improve the market. These include continued promulgation and promotion of \ninternational best practices, formulation of codes of conduct, adoption of international documentation \nsuch as the GMRA and GMSLA to provide better transparency to regulators in the region. \na)  Regulatory transparency \nRegulatory uncertainty increases market risk and legal risk, which makes the relevant markets less \nattractive to investors. It is therefore important for regulators to clearly articulate their regulatory \nintent, and be consistent in its implementation. While there is certainly a benefit from learning from \nregulatory implementation in other jurisdictions, if there is an intention to reform certain markets this \nneeds to occur before the end of the global capital market reforms. Once these are completed, there \nwill be significant resistance by financial institutions for implementing changes, and therefore act as \nan obstacle to foreign investment.  \nIt is important that authorities ensure that the reforms they introduce are appropriate for the realities \nof their market. For example, currently only the very largest markets in APEC are likely to have the \n19 \n ", " \n \nscale to justify the global standards on financial market infrastructures3. \nRecommendation 2-3a: Both responsible authorities and market participants are encouraged to \ncontinue to pursue various initiatives, including promulgation and promotion of international best \npractices and formulation of codes of conduct, to further develop and improve the market, by \nensuring very clear principles on regulatory expectations on capital raising and investment.  \nb)  Adoption of standard documentation  \nRepo  and  securities  lending  market  fragmentation  is  exacerbated  by  local  documentation \nrequirements and standards; also the standard local documentation often does not contain adequate \noperational details or credit protections for international participants. \nRecommendation 2-3b: Securities regulators and policy makers are encouraged to review the local \npractices if they adopt the international standard documentation such as the GMRA and GMSLA and \nundertake promotionally initiatives if they do not. \nc)  Tax and accounting \nIt is important to understand the implications of having manual processes, or of requiring people to \nbe based on the ground. Such manual process would be a barrier even to its own market. For \nexample, complexity and uncertainty of tax can be an obstacle and in some instances its mechanism \nof application can prevent participation in the markets and therefore not be revenue generating.  \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  APFF has produced repo/lending guide which explore in depth the value and the mechanisms of \nrepo markets including very complex, technical things which are very important to the functioning \nof the markets. \n\uf0d8  ABMF has developed Bond Market Guide and have access to tax authority via finance ministry. \nRecommendation 2-3c: Responsible authorities are encouraged to supporting constant dialogues \nwith the industry representatives through public-private platforms including APFF, PASLA, ICMA, \nAsifma, and ABMF to review current policies and practices could effect as a barrier and undertake \nreforms if they do. \nd)  Scarcity of HQLA / Expansion of local collateral eligibility requirements \nLocal currency collateral, including highly rated government bonds with very little credit risk, is often \nnot commonly accepted in international / foreign markets due either to market custom or the internal \nguidelines of key market intermediaries; limiting the flow of collateral and liquidity in the bond \nmarkets. Barriers to cross-border collateral flow due to limited collateral eligibility requirements; \nimpact on markets and liquidity; affected market participants. \nRecommendation  2-3d:  Responsible  authorities  are  encouraged  to  collaborate  together  with \ninternational organizations, to have workshops to better understand the issues to address the \ngrowing need for HQLA collateral in the region. Measures could include how local currency assets \ncould  be  utilized  as  part  of  collateral  accepted  for  cross-border  trades  between  financial \nintermediaries and CCPs, how regional financial integration (including RTGS-CSD linkages) and \nbetter  hedging  markets  would  assist  further  liquidity,  and  identification  of  specific  classes  of \nsecurities  where  liquidity  and  eligibility  could  be  expanded;  followed  by  advocacy  efforts  in \njurisdictions where collateral eligibility could be expanded. \n2-4. Increasing Market Efficiency: Issues Specific to Derivatives \n                                                   \n3 Even though, less developed markets are affected by the changes in the global markets including Basel \nrules (e.g. Leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, and Net Stable Funding Ratio), and electrification of \ntrading practices (e.g. Automated Request for Quote). \n20 \n ", " \n \nGreater regulatory transparency in the OTC derivative markets is a key public policy goal that was \ncodified  at  the  September  2009  Pittsburgh  G20  summit.  Since  then,  much  work  has  been \nundertaken to achieve this goal, however major questions remain as to whether the mountain of data \nnow being generated is helping to improve regulatory transparency in a meaningful way. Currently, \ndespite seeming progress, major challenges remain: \n-  Different, costly, duplicative, conflicting and non-standardized reporting requirements across \njurisdictions \n-  Some data requirements are not clearly defined \n-  The availability of \u2018substituted compliance\u2019 for reporting is limited, adding to duplication \n-  Standardized reporting formats have been not adopted quickly or broadly enough \n-  There  is  a  lack  of  agreement  as  to  how  some  data  reporting  requirements  should  be \nstandardized across jurisdictions \n-  Regulatory endorsement of standards already in use has been limited \n-  Some reporting regimes are \u2018closed markets\u2019 \u2013 meaning they have their own trade repositories \nwhich do not leverage international standards and mechanisms \n-  Legal barriers exist to sharing data and information, both within and across borders \n-  Trade repositories have the unenviable task of collecting and standardizing data from multiple \nsources for multiple jurisdictions, and have their own unique data architectures, formats and \nmethods of sharing information \n-  There is no facilitator or mechanism to aggregate data from different trade repositories globally \n-  There  is  a  lack  of  commitment  among  stakeholders  in  the  process  to  drive  and  achieve \nconsensus in these areas \n \nAs  a  result  of  these  obstacles, regulators  continue  to  lack  a  true  picture  of  risk  in  individual \njurisdictions because of incomplete and inconsistent trade data. On a global level, this means that \nefforts to aggregate data (and risk exposures) remain little more than a dream. \nFortunately, now that major jurisdictions have largely implemented their reporting regimes, national \nregulators  are  increasingly  turning  their  minds  to  cross-border  efforts  to  achieve  regulatory \nconsistency as much as possible. All of these issues have solutions, however they will require the \nactive support and cooperation of a range of global stakeholders \u2013 regulators, market participants \nand infrastructure providers. \nThe Roadmap seeks to enable data to be aggregated across jurisdictions, in order for a global data \nset to be realized for what is a global market in nature. In order to achieve this goal, a number of \ncritical  milestones  need  to  be  met:  including  (a)  a  shared,  public  commitment  to  global \nconvergence on harmonized reporting requirements, (b) greater regulatory endorsement of data \nstandards and formats already in use, (c) the removal of barriers to sharing information across trade \nrepositories  and  borders,  (d)  increased  availability  of  substituted  compliance,  (e)  promotion  of \ninter-operability and connectivity between trade repositories, and (f) the designation of leaders to \ndrive the mechanism for global data aggregation. Their details are as below. \nRecommendations 2-4: \n    a.  Shared, public commitment to global convergence on harmonised reporting requirements \nSecurities regulators are encouraged to review whether their reporting requirements are \nharmonized,  and  consistent  within  and  across  jurisdictions,  and  undertake  regulatory \nreforms if they are not.  \n    b.  Greater regulatory endorsement of data standards and formats already in use \nRegulators are encouraged to embrace standards for derivatives reporting, and those that \nhave not yet deployed their rules should avoid introducing unique requirements. \n-  Requirements should be as precise and prescriptive as possible, which will avoid \nambiguity in achieving compliance \n-  There should be an effort to perform a robust cost-benefit analysis before requiring a \n21 \n ", " \n \nreporting or disclosure regime.  \n-  It is also important to espouse to the market the additional benefits beyond merely \nsatisfying compliance obligations when implementing a reporting regime. Additional \nbenefits can accrue, such as being able to enhance the transparency of pricing, or \nbeing able to utilize data for internal modeling, either for counterparty or risk or trading \nstrategy purposes. \n    c.  The removal of barriers to sharing information across trade repositories and borders  \nRegulators are encouraged to review whether current regulations hinder sharing information \nacross borders, and undertake reforms if they do. \n    d.  Increased availability of substituted compliance \nRegulators are strongly encouraged to defer to each other\u2019s regulatory regimes where their \nintended  outcomes  are  consistent  by  adopting  equivalence  decisions,  which  allows  a \nmulti-jurisdictional  reporting  obligation  for  a  transaction  to  be  discharged  once,  in  a \njurisdiction of the reporting entity\u2019s choice. Regulators with a mandate to access the data for \na transaction should obtain that information from that single report.  \n    e.  Promotion of inter-operability and connectivity between trade repositories \nRegulators are encouraged to review the level of inter-operability between trade repositories \nand promote and incentivise the sharing of data. \n    f.  Greater cross-border regulatory focus on global aggregation mechanisms \nRegulators are encouraged to leverage cooperation with other authorities to achieve their \nobjectives:  both  for  sharing  lessons  learnt,  as  well  as  sharing  data  by  designating \njurisdictional, regional and global leaders to spearhead the aggregation effort. \n-  Removal of barriers to sharing data & information between regulators \n \nThese  objectives  cannot  be  achieved  at  the  individual  jurisdiction  level,  and  require  global \ncollaboration, coordination and engagement. The active support and cooperation of a range of \nstakeholders \u2013 regulators, market participants and infrastructure providers \u2013 is vitally important to \nmaking  this  a  reality.  Only  through  implementing  the  above  measures  can  be  the  goal  of \ntransparency truly be achieved \n \n2-5. Fund Services \na)  Regulatory transparency \nIn an era where more investors are investing for retirement income and can benefit from the diversity \nof funds offered by fund passport initiatives like the Asia Region Funds Passport, managing the \nindustry costs is important to facilitate these investors\u2019 activities. In those economy currently relying \non email or other manual process, a regulator-supported funds back-office processing utility can take \nthe form of a centralized digital network that connects the fund industry\u2019s participants for more \neffective electronic exchange of information. It can improve industry cost efficiency and reduce \noperational risks to benefit asset managers and their investors. For cross-border fund investments, \ninteroperability  among  such  utilities  can  facilitate  the  industry\u2019s  more  effective  compliance  on \nreporting  and  investor  transparency  regulatory  needs.  Additionally,  barriers  to  fund  passport \nparticipation can be lowered due to the reduction of administration, operational and regulatory \nreporting complexities - and thus, contribute to the investment fund industry\u2019s development. \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Common regulatory arrangements for fund passport regimes such as the ASEAN CIS, \nChina-HK MRF, APEC ARFP, etc.  \n \n22 \n ", " \n \nRecommendation  2-5a:  Based  on  the  ASEAN  CIS  experience,  securities  regulators  are \nencouraged  to  set  highly  standardized  registration  process  for  funds  between  passporting \neconomies, in order to ensure that benefits of streamlined regulations are felt by the market. The \ncase of China-HK MRF shows that attractiveness of the product is key in promoting passport scheme, \nand that large-scale funding for pilot funds received a lot of attention from the industry.  \nb)  Standardization and harmonization \nStandardization between business processes will be essential for the automation and efficiency of \nfund services. Fund services are especially highlighted for cross-border trading, because fund \noperators, distributors, registrars, administrators, and custodians located in different jurisdictions \nhave to seamlessly connect their line of services without compromising the product\u2019s attractiveness. \nAmid  the  call  to  better  understand  different  fund  services  in  the  region  and  develop \nrecommendations for standardized practices, a consultative body of CSDs was established under \nthe name of Asia Fund Standardization Forum (AFSF) in 2015. However, it will be important to note \nthat standardization activities will only have meaningful impact if industry-wide implementation is \nencouraged on the regional scale, as failure to do so will result in a development of multiple \nstandards that are not harmonized. \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Establishment and activities of the AFSF \nRecommendation 2-5b: Responsible authorities are encouraged to support for the activities of \nAFSF. Harmonization can be achieved in many parts of the business process (usage of same fund \ncodes or message formats, required information for fund products by regulators or market players, \naccount opening forms, KYC process, etc.) Standardization in the terminology used between fund \nmarkets will be essential for market players to communicate effectively for cross-border transactions.   \nc)  Infrastructure inter-operability \nFund services are an integral part of the investment fund business as an infrastructure that supports \nback-office  processing  and  execution  of  order,  and  their  service  scope  encompass  account \nownership  management,  order  routing,  trade  confirmation,  corporate  action,  fund  balance \nrecord-keeping, and settlement. The importance of fund services is accentuated when fund markets \nmature, as the plateauing of revenue growth from asset management urge companies to turn their \nattention to margin protection, efficiency, and speed. Although fund services conventionally relied on \nmanual intervention, they are moving towards automation and STP, which can promote economies of \nscale, scalability and inter-operability.  \nDespite the need to integrate fund services for cross-border flows, efforts are often hindered by \nvastly disparate practices, absence of a market standard and prevalence of proprietary systems \nfound  across  the  region.  In  this  regards,  an  interesting  solution  surfacing  is  the  adoption  of \ncentralized  fund  hubs  that  interconnects  the  domestic  market,  streamlining  the  many-to-many \ncommunication between diverse players. As is often the case, CSDs are in a good position to invest \nin  infrastructure  projects  for  the  entire  market,  providing  a  level-playing  field  for  large  asset \nmanagement companies and SMEs alike. In the longer term, such local platforms can help increase \ninvestors\u2019 access to less globalized markets and open the door for service linkage between multiple \nmarkets, thereby accelerating fund market integration. \n<Case Study> \n\uf0d8  Centralized fund platforms in Asia (Korea: FundNet, Taiwan: FundClear, Indonesia: \nS-INVEST, Thailand: FundConnext, etc.).  \n\uf0d8  Korea: A centralized digital network called the FundNet was developed by the KSD in \n2004,  linking  every  fund  market  player  in  Korea.  Market  players  can  send  trade/ \n23 \n ", " \n \nsettlement orders by logging into the FundNet interface, which sends the information to \nall relevant parties on STP technology without having to rely on manual methods. Vastly \nimproved operational efficiency has driven market development and daily operating \nvolume for the fund business has jumped by 17 times from 2005 to 2016, from 0.14mn \nto  2.6mn  trade  messages.  Cost  saving  effect  in  the  industry  due  to  FundNet  is \nestimated to be USD 67mn per year (KPMG Strategic Consulting Group, Dec.2013).  \n\uf0d8  Thailand: Faced with the challenges of excessive manual processes and spaghetti-like \nconnection  between  market  players,  the  SET  developed  a  platform  called  the \nFundConnext in 1Q 2017 to drive industry development. As an outcome of close \ncollaboration  with  the  regulator  and  industry  members,  FundConnext  standardizes \nmany aspects of business practices in the Thai fund market, including account opening, \nKYC, and NAV disclosure, and facilitates the STP messaging between market players.  \nRecommendation  2-5c:  Regulators  are  encouraged  to  support  for  the  development  of  fund \nplatforms led by infrastructure providers. The recent case of Thailand\u2019s platform is a good illustration \nof constructive cooperation between the regulator, CSD, and the market.  \nd)  Comprehensive statutory understanding \nWhen financial market infrastructure projects are envisaged, they need to have commercial viability. \nWhere the retail market is involved, there needs to be continued focus on investor education and to \nprovide investors with sufficient transparency to make informed decisions \nThere also should be provisions for the instances where the mechanisms do not work as planned. \nFor example, there must be a clear, well-defined dispute mechanism \u2013 which, for example in the \ncross-border context, might include using an agent. All infrastructure projects should be run with an \nentrepreneurial spirit \n \n   \n24 \n ", " \n \n3.  APEC Roadmap on Data Management and Technology \n3-1. FMI Fintech \nIn the coming year, APFF FMI Fintech Substream will continue its focus on defining best practices \nand laying the groundwork for capacity building in three areas identified by the group in the APFF \n2016 Progress Report, namely Know Your Customer (KYC), E-Payments, and Cybersecurity.  \na)  Know Your Customer \nIdentity is a baseline for participation in the formal financial system. Approximately, 1.5 billion people \naround the world do not have an officially recognized document to prove their identity; many of whom \nlive in emerging markets in across APEC. A government-issued ID is often essential for people to \nbank and transact \u2013 but biometrics, mobile phones, and data enable new ways to open up access \nand participation.  \nClassical forms of identity provisioning struggle to reach underserved populations, contain clear \nsecurity vulnerabilities, and cannot be verified remotely. Several governments across APEC and \nother regions are piloting digital identity programs that would provision a digital identity credential \nthat can be linked to biometrics. These digital ID platforms are scalable, as the information does not \nrequire a physical card or even physical presence to be provisioned and utilized.   \nDigital  IDs  can  be  linked  with  electronic  forms  of  know-your-customer  (e-KYC)  verification \nmechanisms. A secure Digital ID Application Programming Interface (API) enables private sector \nentities to match identity data they have against the government database; enabling a seamless and \ninstantaneous know-your-customer process. These remote instantaneous verification procedures \ncould enable financial services (alongside several other services) to be delivered on a far broader \nscale an in a more efficient manner to promoted economic development in the APEC region.   \nRecommendation 3-1a: APEC Finance Ministers and responsible authorities are encouraged to \nsupport for the following initiatives of APFF FMI Fintech Substream; \n-  Conducting a review of the current Digital ID and e-KYC initiatives being rolled out in several \nAPEC member economies \n-  Analyzing Digital ID and e-KYC initiatives being conducted outside the region to document best \npractices that could be leveraged within the APEC region \n-  Focusing its analysis on solutions that are interoperable at least, and harmonized at best, in \norder  to  promote  economic  integration  among  APEC  member  economies  in  Fintech  KYC \ndevelopments \no  For example, the APEC Travel Card could be looked at as an example of a regional identity \ncredential that could be replicated in the Digital ID context \nb) E-Payments \nPayments form the core of the financial services ecosystem. People, regardless of income level, \nlocation, and education, engage in payments transactions.  Currently, 85% of the world\u2019s payments \ntransactions occur in cash. In certain parts of Europe, however, more than 85% of payments \ntransactions  are  electronic.  Electronic  payments  (e-Payments)  help  to  lower  transaction  costs, \nincrease transparency, and make transfers of money faster and more efficient. Consequently, APEC \nmember economies would benefit tremendously from further digitizing cash payments.   \nPayment card solutions are rapidly proliferating throughout the APEC region and the mobile smart \nphone is also being leveraged to move APEC economies towards a cashless society. There are over \n5 billion mobile devices in the hands of consumers around the world. New electronic payment \nsolutions that leverage the mobile device are being rapidly developed. The inter-operability and \nregulatory requirements associated with these new solutions is currently a challenge for the APEC \n25 \n ", " \n \necosystem that APFF FMI Fintech Substream can help to address.   \nThere are a multitude of players currently introducing solutions for electronic payments including \ngovernments, banks, card networks, mobile operators, and pure technology companies. There is a \ndivergence between e-Payments solutions that leverage telephone networks and those that leverage \nthe Internet. There are also divergent standards for payment solutions leveraging the mobile phone \nitself.  Finally, there are differences in how mobile and card based solutions interact. From a \nregulatory perspective, some e-Payments solutions serve as a pass through for traditional payments \nrails, other payments solutions store value, while still others operate outside of the traditional \necosystem. Each of these solutions pose different regulatory and consumer risks for APEC member \neconomies.  \nRecommendation 3-1b: APEC Finance Ministers and responsible authorities are encouraged to \nsupport for the following initiatives of APFF FMI Fintech Substream; \n-  Exploring  whether  there  are  inter-operability  concerns that  exist  in  the  APEC  e-Payments \necosystem and whether APFF can make recommendations on how to resolve those concerns \n-  Seeking to create a primer on e-Payments in the region \no  Seeking to diagram the e-Payments landscape so that the multitude of actors, solutions, \nand risks across the APEC region is more easily understood \no  Creating a set of definitions to help guide policymakers in understanding the e-Payments \nlandscape \no  Making recommendations on regulatory frameworks for e-Payment solutions based upon \nthe varying risks that they pose, with the best possible accounting for varying market \nconditions in APEC member economies \nc) Cybersecurity \nThe digitization of financial services is coupled with the onset of new cyber-risks. Securing against \nthose risks should be the goal of both the public and private sector in APEC. Issues related to \ncybersecurity extend beyond Fintech. Therefore, the FMI Fintech Substream will coordinate its work \nwith the perspectives from Disruptive Technologies / new FMI-like entities. The risks associated with \ncybersecurity are not well or uniformly understood by policymakers across the APEC region. The \nsolutions to these new risks can be equally challenging to comprehend. Moreover, the role of policy \nand  regulation  for  APEC  member  economies  in  cybersecurity  is  a  tremendous  challenge  as \ntechnology  shifts  rapidly  and  fixed  regulatory  requirements  might  lead  bad  actors  to  attack \nvulnerabilities that were not within the purview of specific regulation.   \nThe major vulnerability associated with Fintech is the multitude of new actors it brings into the \nfinancial services ecosystem and the linkages created between these new actors and in some cases \ntheir interaction with established financial institutions and systems in APEC. Fintech technologies \nsuch as tokenization, however, limit the cyber risks of these new actors by encrypting transactions \nand only passing along tokens instead of actual financial information. The password is another \nsecurity vulnerability that has been proliferated by Fintech, creating opportunity for cyber-criminals to \nseek password credentials to take over accounts. At the same time, new Fintech solutions such as \nbiometric and multi-factor authentication are helping enhance security by reducing reliance on \npasswords.   \nA cybersecurity ecosystem for APEC can only be as strong as its weakest link. And, that is why \npolicymakers in APEC are interested in creating baseline cybersecurity requirements for participants \nin the Fintech ecosystem. The challenge with this approach, however, is that by setting a baseline for \ncybersecurity,  APEC  policymakers  risk  encouraging  complacency  in  the  ecosystem.  Moreover, \nsetting a baseline for cybersecurity among APEC member economies also risks highlighting for bad \nactors where the vulnerabilities lie. Policymakers must utilize more dynamic and flexible regulatory \n26 \n ", " \n \nframeworks when approaching Fintech cybersecurity that will best protect the ecosystem in the \nAPEC region.   \nRecommendation 3-1c: APEC Finance Ministers and responsible authorities are encouraged to \nsupport for the following initiatives of APFF FMI Fintech Substream; \n-  Creating a typology of cybersecurity risks in the fintech ecosystem \n-  Engaging  in  research  and  analysis  of  emerging  cybersecurity  solutions  and  share  those \nlearnings with stakeholders \n-  At public-private forums discuss its findings on cybersecurity risks and solutions and advocate \nhow  identified  best  practices  can  be  adopted  throughout  the  APEC  ecosystem,  without \nregulatory technology mandates wherever possible \n \n3-2. Disruptive Technologies / new FMI-like entities \nNew  so-called  disruptive  technologies  provide  tremendous  opportunities  for  financial  market \ninfrastructures and market participants to operate more efficiently, better service public and private \nsectors, increase and simplify access to financial data and products.  \nDisruptive technologies such as distributed ledger technologies, robot-advisers or artificial intelligence \nbring promises of better data management, faster access to data and cost reduction for the usage of that \ninformation for the benefits of a growing financial product customer base through digitization.  \nThese new technologies however also bring risks such as: \n\uf0d8  technological and operational risks due to their lack of maturity,  \n\uf0d8  fragmentation risks due to a lack of technical and data standardization for mainstream \nand cross-border usage,  \n\uf0d8  cybersecurity and data confidentiality risks,  \n\uf0d8  legal risks considering the existing regulatory uncertainty around their use, especially for \ncross-border activities, and the legal protections that are available (particularly in a \nconsumer context). \n \nRecommendation  3-2a:  Financial  Market  Infrastructures  should  experiment  and  contribute  to  the \nresearch and development exercise required to overcome the maturity challenge. They should work \ncollaboratively with regulators, the financial industry and the broader public sector. Such collaborative \nexperimentation is important not only to contribute to maturing these technologies further but also to \nbetter understand them, ensure focus on the right problems to be solved and identify as well as \nunderstand the risks. It also helps getting the necessary buy-in for when an implementation decision \nneeds to be taken. \nRecommendation 3-2b: Regulators and FMIs also need to collaborate across markets to agree on \nharmonized domestic legal frameworks supporting the implementation of such new technologies and \nensure cross-border regulatory certainty. \nStandardization, both at technical and business data level, needs to be considered from the start to \nensure  inter-operability  both  at  domestic  and  cross-border  level,  inter-operability  between  other \nimplementations  as  well  as  with  legacy  systems  and  processes  who  will  not  disappear \novernight. Leveraging existing reference data standards (Legal Entity Identifier, ISIN, etc.) and business \nstandards such as ISO 20022, but also supporting collaborative open source initiatives such as the \nHyperledger project, should be utilized rather than reinventing the wheel. \nIn this context, Cyber security will also need to be considered from the outset where collaboration will also \nbe needed. Leveraging new technologies around fraud identification and attack prevention will also be \ncritical to ensure the most modern and efficient solutions are implemented. \n27 \n ", " \n \n \nIII.
