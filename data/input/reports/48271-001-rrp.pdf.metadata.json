The  archipelagic  topography  increases  the  nation\u2019s  difficulties  in \ndisseminating the benefits of robust economic growth to the country\u2019s population and improving \nliving standards of the country\u2019s poor, many of whom are scattered in remote islands including \nthose  in  the  central  and  southern  regions.2 Development  of  an  efficient  transport  network  is \ncritical  to  achieve  seamless  movement  of  people  and  goods  across  the  country  and  beyond; \nand to extend the benefits of economic and social growth to more of the population.3 \n \nWith respect to transport infrastructure, the Global Competitiveness Report, 2013\u20132014 \n3. \nranked  the  Philippines  113th  for  airports  and  116th  for  seaport  facilities  out  of  148 countries.4 \nThis  underscores  the  extent  to  which  the  country  has  lagged  in  the  development  of  critical \ninfrastructure,  which  is  a  key  bottleneck  to  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  in  the \ncountry.  A  World  Bank  study  reported  that  the  Philippines\u2019  investments  in  infrastructure \nrepresented an average of only 2.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980\u20132009, which \nwas  far  below  the  World  Bank\u2019s  benchmark  of  5%  of  GDP.  As  a  result,  the  country\u2019s \ninfrastructure is in a dire state\u2014deterring investments in other key sectors such as industry and \nagribusiness. \n \n4. \nPublic resources to support infrastructure development are limited in the Philippines. The \nGovernment of the Philippines has promoted public\u2013private partnership (PPP) for infrastructure \ndevelopment  to  address  the  constraints.  In  support  of  government  initiatives,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  technical  assistance  (TA)  in  2011 5  to  improve  the \ngovernment\u2019s PPP design and capacity, and to finance the bid preparation and implementation \nof  PPP  projects,  including  the  project,  being  administered  by  the  Philippine  PPP  Center.6 The \nproject  would  be  the  first  large  scale  PPP  project  awarded  by  government  under  its  PPP \nagenda. \n\n                                                                  \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The  country  has  seen  robust  economic  growth  despite  the  global  financial  crisis  and  recession.  The  government \n\nreported gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.2% in 2013 and 6.7% in 2012. \n\n3  The  Philippines\u2019 challenges  remain,  for  example, as  in  the poverty  incidence  at  19.7%  in  2012,  according  to  the \nNational  Statistics  Coordination  Board.  Unemployment is  another  example,  at  an  estimated  12.1 million  or  about \n27.5% of the population of adults in the labor force during the last quarter of 2013 as reported by Social Weather \nStations in February 2014. \n\n4  World Economic Forum. 2013. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2013\u20132014. Geneva. \n\nhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2013-14.pdf. \n\n5  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening Public\u2013Private Partnerships. \n\nManila (February). \n\n6  Since  the  Philippines  PPP  program  was  launched  in  2010,  eight  projects,  (including  this  project)  have  been \nsuccessfully awarded to the private sector concessionaire through a competitive and transparent bidding process \nas of 15 September 2014. Another six projects are going through the tender processes. The government hopes to \naward 15 PPP projects before the end of the term of the current administration in June 2016. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n5. \nThe Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA) is located in the province of Cebu, Central \nVisayas region. The region, which is composed of four island provinces with a population of 6.8 \nmillion  in  2010,  is  a  major  regional  economy  accounting  for  6.2%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product. It is among the three fastest growing regions with annual average growth of \n7.9% in 2010\u201320117. Cebu, which is the region\u2019s center, is one of the most developed provinces \nin the country and the second most populated province with a population of about 4.2 million in \n2010.  The  economy  of  Cebu  is  the  largest  after  Metro  Manila.  The  major  economic  driver  of \ngrowth for Cebu is tourism, industries and business process outsourcing. The island of Cebu is \nthe most accessible place in the country with more domestic air and sea linkages than any other \ncity  in the  Philippines,  which  is  an  ideal  location for trade  and  industry. The  province  is  also  a \npopular vacation destination of both international and domestic tourists.   \n \n6. \nThe  MCIA  is  the  international  gateway  to  Visayas.  There  are  no  other  airports  in  the \nregion  that  is  designed  to  handle  high  volume  of  international  traffic.  Opened  for  commercial \noperations in the 1960s, MCIA is designed to serve 4.5 million passengers per annum (mppa). \nThe  government\u2019s  liberalization  of  the  airline  industry  and  increased  focus  on  tourism  and \nindustrial  and  commercial  development  have  resulted  in  an  increasing  number  of  flights  and \npassengers  using  the  country\u2019s  airports,  including  the  MCIA. 8 The  airport  has  experienced \nimpressive  passenger  growth  over  the  past  decade  and  in  2012,  MCIA  served  more  than  6.7 \nmillion  passengers.  This  has  strained  airport  infrastructure,  affected  service  and  passenger \nconvenience, and exposed the airport\u2019s lack of capacity to handle more passengers, especially \nduring peak hours. Without the proposed expansion at MCIA, the infrastructure constraint could \nlimit  further  growth  in  the  tourism  and  other  key  sectors,  which  are  essential  in  providing \nemployment opportunities for sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the region.    \n \n7. \nThe  Department  of  Transportation  and  Communication  (DOTC)  and  Mactan  Cebu \nInternational  Airport  Authority  (MCIAA)  launched  an  invitation  to  bid  for  the  project  on \n21 December  2012.  Seven  groups  responded  to  the  invitation  and  submitted  bids  on \n28 November 2013 for a concession right to the project.9 The consortium of GMR Infrastructure \nLtd (GIL) and Megawide Construction Corporation (MCC) submitted the highest bid by offering a \npremium of P14.4 billion for the rights to the project. The notice of award was issued to the GIL\u2013\nMCC  consortium  by  DOTC  on  4  April  2014.  The  government  and  the  GIL-MCC  consortium \nsigned  the  Mactan  Cebu  airport  concession  agreement  on  22  April  2014.  ADB  was  in \ndiscussions  with  the  consortium,  before  the  bid,  for  its  potential  financial  assistance  to  the \nproject.  The  project  fully  meets  ADB\u2019s  strategic,  country,  and  sector  approaches  for \ninfrastructure development and poverty reduction. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  involves  (i)  construction  of  a  new  passenger  terminal  with  a  designed \n8. \ncapacity of 8 mppa, (ii) renovation of the existing passenger terminal with a designed capacity of \n4.5 mppa,10 (iii) construction of an apron for the new passenger terminal, (iv) development and \nconstruction of commercial facilities, and (v) the operation and management of both passenger \n                                                                  \n7   Regional Development Council. Central Visayas Region. www.rdc7.net.ph \n8  The government has increased focus on building the country\u2019s tourism industry to boost air traffic to the country, \nwith the aim of attracting 10 million visitors per year by the end of 2017, up from almost 4.7 million visitors in 2013. \n9 The seven groups are (i) AAA Airports Partners (Ayala, Aboitiz, ADBC & HAS consortium); (ii) Filinvest and Changi \nAirport  consortium;  (iii)  First  Philippine  Airports  (Lopez  and  Infratil  Asia  consortium);  (iv)  GMR  Infrastructure  and \nMegawide  consortium;  (v)  MPIC,  JG  Summit,  and  Aeroports  de  Lyon  Consortium;  (vi)  Premier  Airport  Group \n(Zurich Airport, Citadel, and SM Group); and (vii) SMC and Incheon Airport Group. \n\n10 The renovation would be undertaken after construction of the new passenger terminal is completed. \n\n\f3 \n\nterminals and commercial facilities over a 25-year concession period starting from the handover \ndate.  During  the  term  of  the  concession,  GMCAC  may  undertake  capital  expenditures  to \naugment  capacity  to  ensure  compliance  with  performance  standards  specified  under  the \nconcession agreement. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\nGMCAC  is  a  special  purpose  vehicle  established  to  implement  the  project.  The \n\n9. \nsponsors, GIL and MCC, will contribute 40% (GIL) and 60% (MCC) of the equity.11 \n \n10. \nGIL  is  a  holding  company  based  in  India.  It  has  a  portfolio  of  investments  in  several \ninfrastructure  projects  in  four  segments:  airports,  energy,  road,  and  sports  and  urban \ninfrastructure. In the airports sector, GIL is considered the fourth largest private airport operator \nin  the  world,  having  invested  about  $4  billion  in  three  airports.12 For  the  year  ending  March \n2013,  the  GIL  airports  handled  close  to  80  million  passengers  combined.  GIL  airports  include \n(i) India\u2019s  busiest  airport,  the  Indira  Gandhi  International  Airport  in  New  Delhi;  (ii)  Rajiv  Gadhi \nInternational  Airport  in  Hyderabad;  and  (iii)  Istanbul  Sabiha  G\u00f6k\u00e7en  International  Airport  in \nTurkey.13 Under the leadership of GIL, these airports received several accolades.14 \n \n11.  MCC is engaged in the general construction business in the Philippines. It is a publicly \nlisted  company.  MCC  is  recognized  as  a  leader  in  the  construction  industry  for  the  use  of \nmodern  technology.  In  addition  to  winning  the  project  in  partnership  with  GIL,  MCC  has  won \nthree  PPP  projects\u2014the  building  of classrooms (Phase  1  and  2)  and  the modernization  of the \nPhilippine Orthopedic Center, which it is implementing. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n12. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  (i)  improved  international  and  domestic  air  transport \nservices  in  the  Philippines,  and  (ii)  greater  private  sector  investment  in  airport  PPPs  in  the \nPhilippines. The government plans to establish a sustainable transport system in the Philippines \nthat would not only improve the mobility of the country\u2019s population but would also significantly \nincrease the development of the various provinces in the country. The project will demonstrate \nthe  commitment  of  the  government  to  provide  critical  infrastructure,  the  lack  of  which  has \nimpeded economic growth and capital investments. Successful financing and implementation of \nthe project will encourage further investments in similar projects under a PPP arrangement. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n13. \nThe outcome will be efficient and high-quality operations at the MCIA that meet required \nstandards. The outcome will be measured, among others, by increased international passenger \ntraffic  to  Cebu;  increased  air  traffic  movements;  achievement  of  at  least  International  Air \nTransport Association C service standards; and increased government revenues in the form of \n                                                                  \n11 The Philippines\u2019 constitution restricts foreign ownership of public utilities such as airports to 40% of equity. \n12 The three larger private airport operators are (i) Ferrovial S.A., (Spain), (ii) TAV (Turkey), and (iii) PSP Investments \n\n(Canada). \n\n13 GIL sold its equity stake in the Istanbul airport in December 2013. \n14 New Delhi airport was recognized as the second best airport in the 25\u201350 mppa category in 2012 by the Airports \nCouncil  International;  and  the  world\u2019s  most  improved  airport  in  2012  by  SKYTRAX.  Hyderabad  Airport  was \nrecognized in 2010, 2011, and 2012 as the second best airport in the world in the 5\u201315 mppa category in Airport \nService Quality; and India\u2019s third best airport in 2012 by SKYTRAX. Istanbul airport was cited the best airport in the \nWorld Low Cost Airline Awards in 2010. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\npremium payment for the concession and taxes from the project. The growth in passengers will \ngenerate direct and indirect employment opportunities in the province of Cebu. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\nThe project\u2019s output will be improved airport facilities at the MCIA, which will be reflected \n14. \nin  (i)  a  new  passenger  terminal  completed  and  another  passenger  terminal  renovated  and \noperational by 2019, (ii) passenger capacity increased from 4.5 million in 2014 to 12.5 million by \n2019, and (iii) about 400 workers employed for construction work.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n15. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  aims  to \nachieve inclusive economic growth in its developing member countries through the provision of \ninfrastructure  that  would  connect  the  poor  to  markets  and  increase  their  access  to  basic \nproductive  assets.15 Strategy  2020  promotes  PPP  arrangements  in  the  transport  sector  and \nencourages ADB support for PPP projects through direct financing. \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132016  aims  to  help  the  country  achieve  high, \ninclusive,  and  sustainable  growth.16 The  strategy  supports  infrastructure  development,  which \nincludes improvement of the country\u2019s port operations through PPP arrangements. \n\n \n17. \nADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  emphasizes  private  sector  participation  in \ntransport  as  an  integral  part  of  mainstreaming  sustainable  transport  in  its  developing  member \ncountries.17 \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 1 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\n18. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n   \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework  Build\u2013own\u2013transfer  law  that  allows  the  government  to  enter  into \nfor \n\nArrangements \n\ncontractual  arrangements  with  private  sector  entities \ninfrastructure facilities \nthe \nGMCAC,  a  special  purpose  company, \nPhilippines.

The  loan  will  be \ndenominated  in  US  dollars.  The  financing  agreements  will  contain  standard  provisions  for \ntransactions of this nature. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n20. \n\nADB\u2019s support for the project is justified based on the following: \n(i) \n\nThe  successful  implementation  of  the  first  large  infrastructure  project  awarded \nunder  the  government\u2019s  PPP  program  would  attract  interest  in  long-term \ninvestments in the country. ADB\u2019s involvement will help ensure the government\u2019s \nlong-term  support  for  the  project,  which  would  give  comfort  to  international \ninvestors and lenders. \nADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  project  will  help  ensure  that  GMCAC  will  adopt  best \npractices  in  airport  terminal  operations  including  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  standards, \nwhich could be replicated. \nThe  proposed  long-tenor  debt  from  ADB  plays  a  crucial  role  in  ensuring  the \neconomic  and  financial  viability  of  the  project.  ADB  will  also  contribute  prudent \nstructuring of the financing package in line with regional models. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n21. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nindigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment of GMCAC to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate.  \n \n22. \nThe  social  compliance  audit  included  in  the  IEE  confirmed  that  no  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement issues, relevant to the existing facilities that will be rehabilitated, are pending. New \nfacilities  will  be  constructed  on  a  portion  of  state-owned  land  inside  Mactan\u2013Benito  Ebuen  Air \nBase. Except for military buildings and facilities, no other informal structures or encroachments \nare inside the security controlled air base. The road network to be improved will be undertaken \non  existing  rights-of-way  requiring  no  additional  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement. \nCebu  and  Mactan  are  highly  urbanized  areas  and  no  indigenous  peoples,  ethnic  groups,  or \ntribal  groups  in  the  project  area  fall  under  the  category  of  indigenous  peoples  described  in \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nOther social dimensions. The project is categorized as having some gender elements. \n23. \nGMCAC  is  considering  the  project  design  features  that  cater  to  the  needs  of  women  and  the \ndisabled. GMCAC is required to ensure that the design and features of the airport will follow the \nprovisions of the Philippine Accessibility Law (Batas Pambansa Bilang 344), 1982. GMCAC will \nalso  organize  orientation  and  training  programs  on  specialized  topics  such  as  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and trafficking of women. MCIAA personnel, whose functions are directly involved in \nthe terminal operations, were offered a transfer to GMCAC.
