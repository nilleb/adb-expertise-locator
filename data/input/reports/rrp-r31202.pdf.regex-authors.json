Despite the \nprogress made in agricultural production and export growth, and \nin liberalizing commodity, land, and credit markets in recent years, \nrural  poverty  remains  high  and  the  level  of  private  sector \ninvestment  remains low. Growth in the past was the result of \n(i) reliance on higher input use (labor, land, fertilizer, tractors, and \nirrigation);  (ii)  policy  reforms  in  land,  markets,  and  trade;  and \n(iii) high public investment, mainly in irrigation and roads. This \nstrategy will not be able to sustain growth in the future because \n(i) the potential for expanding the rural labor force and land under \ncultivation  is  limited;  (ii)  new  investment  in  irrigation  exhibits \ndecreasing marginal returns as the stock of irrigation capital is \nalready  very  high  and  requires  increased  operation  and \nmaintenance rather than new expansion; and (iii) revenue from \nrice  export  is  declining.  Viet  Nam  is  already  experiencing \noverproduction  of  rice,  coffee,  and  other  commodities  and \ndeclining export revenues from unprocessed commodities. As a \nresult, the Government is paying high storage costs for these \nunsold goods.  \n \nPolicy  makers  in  the  Government  are  interested  in  sustaining \ngrowth, employment, and exports in agriculture so as to reduce \nrural  poverty  and  in  effecting  policy  reforms  for  commercial \nagriculture,  livestock,  water  resources,  and  forestry.  Policy \nreforms  in  the  development  and  use  of  technologies  through \nresearch and extension and improved access to credit by small- \nand  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  expected  to \n(i) increase  factor  productivity;  (ii)  improve  yields;  (iii)  foster \ndiversification  into  available  markets  for  higher  value  crops; \n(iv) improve the quality of products such as rice, coffee, livestock \nproducts,  fruits  and  vegetables  that  respond  to  and  meet  the \nrequirements  of  specific,  well-targeted  domestic  and  export \nmarkets; (v) increase value-added production; and (vi) expand \nrural industries and services. With increased understanding of and \nresponsiveness  to  different  markets,  competitiveness  in  export \nmarkets is expected to improve. In turn, this is expected to have \nbeneficial impacts on rural poverty by increasing employment and \nreducing indebtedness and sales of landholdings.  \n   \n   ", "  iii\nThe Program Loan   \n   \n  Objectives  The Program has been designed to assist the Government address \nkey agriculture constraints related to productivity, profitability, and \ncompetitiveness with emphasis on small farmers and SMEs. The \ngoals  are  to  increase  sustainable  agricultural  growth  and  rural \nemployment.  \n   \n  Components  The  Program  will  involve  (i)  restructuring  the  management  of \n  and Outputs  research and extension, (ii) improving market intelligence, and \n(iii) encouraging  the  development  and  partially  closing  the \nfinancing  gaps  of  agro-industry  SMEs  that  will  increase  their \ncompetitiveness with other public and private enterprises in the \nsector. Increasing the quality and funding of agricultural research \nand extension will (i) improve crop diversification and yields of \nhigher  income  crops  with  market  opportunities,  (ii)  facilitate \nintegration  with  postharvest  systems  and  agroprocessing, \n(iii) improve the quality of production with market potential, and \n(iv) increase stakeholder participation in extension and improved \ntechnology dissemination \n   \n  Financing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of $60 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources, with a term of 24 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years; and with an interest charge of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \n  Program Period  The loan will finance policy reforms and will be released in three \n  and Tranching  tranches over 3 years from April 2003 to March 2006. The first \ntranche of $20 million equivalent will be available for release upon \nloan  effectiveness,  subject  to  full  compliance  with  first-tranche \nconditions. The second tranche of $20 million equivalent will be \nreleased approximately 18 months later after the Government has  \ncomplied with the second-tranche conditions. The third tranche of \n$20 million equivalent will be released within 36 months of the first \ntranche  after  Government  compliance  with  the  third-tranche \nconditions. \n   \n  Counterpart  The Government has agreed to use the local currency proceeds \n  Funds  of the loan to support reforms in the agriculture sector. \n   \n  Executing Agency  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD).  A \n  and  program implementation unit has been established with a director \n  Implementation  and a deputy director. In addition, a program steering committee \n  Arrangements  has been established with a vice minister as its chairman. \n   \nThe Project Loan   \n   \n  Objectives  A project loan will improve the availability of and access to funds \nfor private agro-industry SMEs which have largely been bypassed \nby the formal banking sector.  \n   \n   \n \n ", "iv   \n  Components  The project loan will provide funds for medium- and long-term \n  and Outputs  loans  to  SMEs  in  agro-industry.  The  Project  will  support \nenvironmentally sound rural businesses to improve productivity, \nenhance  product  quality,  and  generate  economic  growth  and \nemployment.  Potential  businesses  cover  broad  categories  of \neconomic activities including (i) agricultural input producers and \nsuppliers;  (ii)  processors  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  other \nhorticultural  crops,  and  processors  of  industrial  crops; \n(iii) processors of fish and livestock products; (iv) services such as \nmechanization;  (v)  small-scale  manufacturers  producing  goods \nsuch as baskets and bags, mats, furniture, woven products; and \n(vi) storage and marketing businesses. \n   \n  Financing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of $30 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years; and with an interest charge of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \n  Executing Agency  Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD). \n  and  A project implementation unit has been established with a part-\n  Implementation  time director. It will be responsible for (i) submitting withdrawal \n  Arrangements  applications  to  ADB;  (ii)  coordinating  and  consolidating  the \ninvestment loan reporting requirements; (iii) undertaking benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  (iv)  advertising  the  credit  line  and \nsupervising its implementation; (v) carrying out a midterm review \nand  evaluation;  and  (vi)  producing  progress  reports,  project \ncompletion  reports,  and  other  reports  as  may  reasonably  be \nrequired by ADB during implementation. \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the program loan will be utilized to finance the full \nforeign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of \ngoods and services produced in and procured from ADB member \ncountries  (other  than  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources). \nEligible items will be procured on the basis of normal commercial \npractices  for  procurement  by  the  private  sector  or  standard \nprocurement practices by the Government or its representatives \nacceptable to ADB. Procurement under subloans by subborrowers \nof the project loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for \nloans to development institutions and private SME subborrowers. \n   \nBenefits and  The  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP)  will \nBeneficiaries  address  policy  issues  that  are  impeding  agriculture  sector \nperformance  and  have  socioeconomic,  poverty-related,  and \nenvironmental  impacts.  These  issues  include  (i)  ineffective \nresearch and extension services that are top-down and largely \ninaccessible  to  small  and  poor  farmers  and  nonfarm  rural \nhouseholds;  (ii)  unsatisfactory  performance,  staffing  problems, \nand  overlapping  functions  of  research  institutes  and  extension\n   \n \n ", "  v\n  offices; (iii) inadequate funding to better target  the needs of poor \nand marginalized households; (iv) poor market intelligence to help \nsmall farmers and marketing households make decisions; (v) seed \nsubsidies that do not favor the poor and small farmers and divert \nscarce resources from extension activities; and (vi) low levels of \nlending  from  commercial  sources  to  agro-industry  SMEs  that \nemploy large numbers of poor workers.  \n   \nRisks   The Government has expressed a strong sense of ownership and \ncommitment  to  the  policy  reforms  under  ASDP.  Given  the \nacceptability  and  urgency  of  the  reforms,  the  agreed-upon \ntimetable for implementation is considered realistic. The positive \nresponse from all major stakeholders minimizes the risk of policy \nreversal. There is a major risk of delays in implementation and \nrelease  of  the  second  and  third  tranches.  The  Program  was \ndesigned in a highly consultative process to ensure that the views \nof all the stakeholders (the Government, farmers, private sector \nrepresentatives,  and  nongovernment  organizations)  were \nacknowledged,  and  agreement  was  reached  on  the  policy \npackage.  Multiple  stakeholders,  including  government,  mass \norganization, and private sector participation, will be involved in \nthe  program  steering  committee  and  in  provincial  extension \nadvisory  councils.  The  chosen  reforms  comprise  fewer  but \nessential measures in line with the Government\u2019s priority for the \nsector and ADB\u2019s country strategy for Viet Nam. The program \nloan will be released in three tranches about 18 months apart. \nThis  will  allow  greater  dialogue  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment, allow more time for the Government to implement \nthe reforms, and enable the various stakeholders with different \ninterests to develop a sense of ownership of the policies. Also, a \nsteering committee comprising senior staff from all the concerned \nministries and agencies has been established to oversee program \nimplementation and the policy reforms. \n   \n \n   \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Agriculture Sector Development Program.  \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  By most measures of performance, Viet Nam has experienced successful economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction over the last 15 years since economic reform or doi moi was \nintroduced in 1986. During the 1990s, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of \nabout 7.5% per year, and in 2002 was an estimated 5.7%.1 Agriculture accounts for about 22% \nof GDP. Per capita GDP almost doubled during the last decade, and the ratio of domestic \nsavings to GDP increased by 2.5 times. Capital formation also almost doubled during this \nperiod. The economic slowdown that started in 2000 and was accentuated after 11 September \n2001 has dampened GDP growth in recent years. Foreign direct investment has slackened \nsince its peak in the mid-1990s, largely due to perceptions that the cost of doing business in \nViet Nam is high and that the Government is not willing to accelerate economic reforms. \nNevertheless,  macroeconomic  indicators  such  as  inflation,  fiscal  deficits,  current  account \ndeficits, and external debt are within manageable limits. \n \n3.  The incidence of poverty had been cut in half, from about 70% in 1990 to 37% in 2000. \nRural poverty was reduced from 66% in 1993 to 45% in 1998. There has also been significant \nimprovement in social indicators, with almost universal primary education access, and reduced \nincidence of infant mortality, under-five mortality, child malnutrition, and maternal mortality. \nHowever, there are major challenges in reducing poverty further. The incidence of rural poverty \nis much higher, and about 90% of the total poor population reside in rural areas. Poor villages \nand communes lack basic infrastructure and health facilities. Poverty incidence is higher in the \nnorthern areas (60%) and among ethnic minorities (75%).  \n \n4.  Agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction have also been impressive over the last \ndecade.  Growth  in  agricultural  production  averaged  4-5%  per  annum,  and  the  value  of \nagricultural output (80% in the form of crops and livestock, with the remainder from forestry and \nfisheries) grew 4.2% per year (Appendix 1). Agricultural growth was among the highest in the \nworld during the 1990s, comparable with that in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). This \ngrowth was mainly due to market-oriented reforms that recognized the farm household as the \nkey  unit  of  production,  liberalized  land-use  rights,  and  liberalized  decision  making  on  the \npurchase of inputs and sale of outputs. The ratio of cultivatable land per person is very low, \nsuggesting that Viet Nam has a comparative advantage in production that maximizes value-\nadded per unit of land. Agriculture will continue to grow at a lower rate than industry and \nservices; thus, acceleration of employment in rural services and industry is essential to minimize \nwidening income disparities. Rice production (accounting for 60% of the cultivated area) grew at \n4.3%  during  the  1990s  due  to  increases  in  yield  and  cropping  intensity.  The  growth  in \nagricultural exports was also noteworthy. The value of agricultural exports grew at over 13% per \nyear  during  this  period,  and  is  currently  about  $4.4  billion  per  year,  more  than  60%  of \nagricultural  GDP.  Rice,  coffee,  rubber,  cashews,  tea,  pepper,  and  seafood  are  the  major \nagricultural export items. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Asian Development Outlook 2002 Update. Manila. ", "2   \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) contributed to sector growth in the 1990s and the \nresultant reduction in rural poverty through the Agriculture Sector Program.2  This program had \nthree components: (i) market orientation and efficiency, (ii) rural financial intermediation, and (iii) \nland  tenure.  The  program  was  rated  as  successful  in  increasing  market  orientation  and \nincreasing rice production and exports, fertilizer imports; providing sustainable banking services \nto farmers including the poor; and increasing the issue of land use certificates for agricultural \nland and forestland.3 However, there remains some unfinished business in terms of complete \nmarket liberalization, access to credit, and land use rights. These are discussed below. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Problem Analysis \n6.  The past agricultural strategy was largely successful in generating and sustaining self-\nsufficiency in food, expanding exports, increasing rural employment, and reducing rural poverty. \nHowever, the strategy is no longer sufficient to ensure future sustained agricultural growth in \nproductivity and poverty reduction, because of declining (i) returns to labor, (ii) rice demand and \nexports due to low quality, and (iii) returns to irrigation infrastructure where rice is the dominant \noutput. Also, growth in agriculture value-added declined from a high of 5.2% in 1999 to 2.3% in \n2001, and an estimated 2.1% in 2002.4  In contrast, industry and services experienced higher \nand increasing growth rates in this period. Viet Nam has been a successful exporter of low-\nquality rice (e.g., high quantity of broken rice to Africa, Indonesia, and Philippines), coffee, \nrubber, cashew, tea, and black pepper. Viet Nam has not been successful in producing higher \nquality and higher priced agricultural commodities for export. As a result, while export volumes \nof these major commodities have continued to rise since 2000, export values and revenues \nhave fallen due to low prices for rice, coffee, and tea in international markets.5 This situation is \nexpected to continue in the medium term. Agricultural value-added per hectare (ha) is relatively \nhigh in Viet Nam by international standards (about $1,000/ha). However, the small size of the \naverage farm (0.14 ha/capita) means that value-added per person is low ($140/person). A new \nstrategy based on crop diversification and growth in high-quality and high-value products is \nneeded. It will require shifting the focus from a primary commodity to a finished or intermediate \nproduct, and from production volume to quality value addition. \n \n7.  The  core  sector  problems  are  low  productivity  and  profitability,  lack  of  production \ndiversity, low quality, and low competitiveness of the agricultural system. The causes of these \nproblems  include  (i)  low  agricultural  diversification;  (ii)  weak  integration  with  postharvest \nsystems  and  response  to  market  quality  requirements;  (iii)  poor  management  of  natural \nresources; (iv) low private sector investment in agricultural processing, trade, and input supply; \nand (v) weak stakeholder participation in efforts to improve extension and production. The major \nfactors  contributing  to  low  productivity  and  low  agricultural  diversification  include \n(i) underdeveloped  and  weak  research  and  extension,  (ii)  underdeveloped  seed  production \nsystems,  (iii)  restricted  land  use  rights,  (iv)  limited  access  to  financial  services,  and \n                                                 \n2  Loan 1340(SF), for $80 million, approved on 8 December 1994, and completed on 30 June 1998, and two \nassociated technical assistance (TAs): TA 2224, Rice Market Monitoring and Policy Options Study, for $832,000, \ncompleted in December 1996; and TA 2225, Land Information System and Agricultural Taxation Study, for \n$646,000, completed in June 1998.

Asian Development Outlook 2002. Manila. \n5  Due to declining prices, the total value of agricultural commodity exports fell from $3.2 billion in 1999 to $2.8 billion \nin 2000 and $2.6 billion in 2001, despite increased volumes. Source: General Department of Customs, Hanoi, \n2002. \n   \n \n ", "  3\n(v) deteriorating and inefficient irrigation systems that require upgrading. Agricultural growth has \nrelied increasingly on intensification and diversification. Intensification has expanded production \nbut has also led to some soil degradation problems, particularly in upland areas. Maintenance of \nsoil fertility is more difficult in upland areas. A major factor inhibiting private sector investment in \nagriculture  has  been  the  dominant  role  of  inefficient  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  As \ndiscussed below, SOE reforms with donor support and new Government policies to provide \nincentives to small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development and removal of directed \nlending programs from commercial banks to SOEs are being implemented to help reverse the \nbias against private sector involvement in marketing, trade, and production activities.  \n \n8.   Agricultural research in Viet Nam is characterized by a fragmentation of efforts. About \n37  research  institutes  with  small  budgets  exist.  Their  concentration  in  the  Red  River  and \nMekong  Deltas,  with  insufficient  representation  in  other  agroecological  zones,  limits  the \nrelevance  of  research  results.  Viet  Nam  spends  only  about  0.3%  of  agricultural  GDP  on \nresearch, compared with 0.6% in the PRC and 1.4% in Thailand. Other problems are poor \ncoordination  among  research  institutions,  weak  linkages  with  extension,  a  shortage  of \nsufficiently  qualified  researchers  and  extension  agents,  poorly  maintained  research \ninfrastructure,  and  insufficient  involvement  of  stakeholders.  On  the  other  hand,  irrigation \nabsorbs the largest share (50%) of the state budget to agriculture; most (90%) of this is used for \ncapital expenditures. As a result, operation and maintenance are neglected. \n \n9.  The national extension system created recently in 1993 is operational in only 50% of the \ncommunes  (collection  of  villages).  The  farmer-agent  ratio  is  estimated  at  1,250:1.  Other \nconstraints include a top-down approach in dealing with farmers, insufficient knowledge and \nskills  in  effective  communication,  poor  technological  recommendations,  lack  of  funding  for \neffective operations (despite the fact that provincial governments provide about 50% of annual \nbudgets), and ineffective use of mass media and information technology. Public expenditure on \nagricultural extension in 2002 was only D441 billion ($29 million) or 0.4% of agricultural GDP. \nThis is very low compared with that in neighboring PRC, Thailand, and Malaysia. \n \n10.  Improved seed is produced by a variety of organizations, including universities, research \ninstitutes, public seed agencies, and private seed companies. Because of limited funding for \nbreeding and research operations, research institutes supplement their budgets with the sale of \nseed directly to both seed companies and farmers. Quality control is insufficient and limited to \ntesting  by  the  National  Center  for  Variety  Evaluation  and  Seed  Certification.  The  Danish \nInternational Development Agency (Danida) is currently funding a seed project as part of the \nAgriculture Sector Program Support, with a focus on seed certification, quality control and \nregulation, seed research and pathology, and seed production and processing. Efforts are \nfocused on rice and maize seeds, the two most important food crops, and institutional support at \nnational, provincial, and on-farm levels. De facto restrictions prevent trade in seed between \nprovinces. As a result of these problems, the use of certified seed is small in the Mekong River \nDelta, rice yields have stagnated over the past 5 years, and maize yields are low (2.5 tons/ha) \ndespite the increasing adoption of improved seed. Subsidies on the commercial production of \nhybrid  rice  and  maize  seeds,  administered  by  provincial  governments  and  the  national \nextension service, are becoming increasingly unnecessary given the widespread adoption of \nhybrids. Such subsidies divert needed funds away from agricultural extension to small farmers, \nand discourage to some extent private seed company sales of these hybrids. However, the \npromotion of hybrid rice seeds remains an important part of poverty reduction programs for poor \nand subsistence farmers in mountainous regions (Appendix 1). \n \n   \n \n ", "4   \n11.  The major constraints affecting postharvest systems include (i) continued discrimination \nagainst private enterprises, (ii) incomplete market liberalization, (iii) inadequate access to land \nand credit for private investment, (iv) lack of market information and support systems, and (v) \nlack of grades and standards. The role of SOEs in agriculture has diminished, but they still \ndominate processing, exports, and imports. Exports of rice, coffee, tea, cashew, pepper, and \nrubber, and imports of fertilizer are carried out almost exclusively by SOEs. SOEs also enjoy \npreferential access to credit and land. In some cases, these enterprises continue to receive \nspecial  assistance  even  after  equitization.  On  the  other  hand,  credit  and  land  availability \nseriously constrain private enterprises wishing to expand their operations. Since the late 1980s, \nViet Nam\u2019s trade policy has been extensively liberalized, resulting in the dramatic growth of \nexports and imports. Following the Asian crisis of 1997, however, reforms have stalled, some \nwith policy reversals. Fertilizer and sugar are subject to \u201cmanaged imports,\u201d although the policy \nis protectionist only in the case of sugar. Vegetable oil is also subject to managed imports under \n\u201ctemporary legislation.\u201d Imports of seeds, breeding animals, and other agricultural inputs require \ngovernment approval, often resulting in delays. \n \n12.  The existing Land Law limits the use rights of agricultural land to 3 ha. This has restricted \nland  market  transfers.  Because  households  attempt  to  evade  these  restrictions,  most \ntransactions are unregistered and official information about land distribution becomes unreliable. \nRestrictions on the conversion of paddy land limit other more profitable uses of land and slow \ndown the rate of crop diversification. Previous policy changes have lifted several of these \nrestrictions.  However,  using  land  as  collateral  for  bank  credit  is  problematic  because  of \ndifficulties in foreclosure.  \n \n13.  Regarding  rural  financial  services,  the  Viet  Nam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment (VBARD) has performed well in providing lending and savings deposit services to \nsmall farmers and microenterprises with very small operations and average loan sizes. VBARD \nhas managed strong growth in lending while keeping repayment rates high. However, its loan \nportfolio to SOEs has not performed well. VBARD\u2019s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is below \naccepted international norms (8%) largely due to poor performing loans to SOEs. Despite \nVBARD\u2019s focus on small farmers and microenterprises, only one third of rural households have \naccess to formal credit in a given year. Most of this credit is short term (less than 1 year), and \nthe average loan size is small (about $300), reflecting the focus on small farmers and other \nborrowers. Access to larger loans on medium and long terms to develop SMEs has been \nlimited. Interest rate ceilings in the past prevented VBARD and other banks from offering credit \nto riskier or smaller borrowers, as well as limited their ability to mobilize savings. The Bank for \nthe Poor is now completely separate from VBARD, with its own capital, ownership, and mandate \nto lend exclusively to the poor. Favored treatment of SOEs in the past has limited the pool of \ncapital available to farmers and SMEs. However, VBARD in 2002 enacted a new policy that will \nexpand its limited SME portfolio and reduce its SOE portfolio over time. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n14.  Assisted  by  ADB  in  preparing  this  sector  development  program,  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) developed a new agriculture and rural development \nplan and strategy for 2001-2010. The strategy focuses on (i) intensifying agricultural production; \n(ii) diversifying into higher value crops and new markets; (iii) promoting off-farm employment; \nand  (iv)  targeting  poverty,  especially  in  remote  and  upland  areas.  The  instruments  for \nimplementing  this  strategy  include  (i)  science  and  technology  advancements;  (ii)  market- \nsupporting infrastructure and institutions; (iii) private sector investment with a focus on SMEs \nand  off-farm  employment;  (iv)  rural  infrastructure;  and  (v)  participation  of  concerned \n   \n \n ", "  5\nstakeholders at all levels in policy, planning, and implementation. The ninth Party Congress \napproved this strategy in mid-2001 as part of its 10-year development plan. Some of the \nquantitative targets over the next decade include (i) sustaining an annual growth rate of 4.5% in \nagriculture; (ii) increasing rice paddy production from 34 million tons to 40 million tons; (iii) \nincreasing the value of total agricultural exports from $4.4 billion to $9 billion; (iv) decreasing \nrural poverty from 45% to 27%; (v) sustaining an annual growth rate of 9-12% for rural industry \nand services; (vi) increasing the share of industry, trade, and services in the rural economy from \n30% to 45%; and (vii) increasing the average product value of an agricultural laborer from $310 \nto $1,500. \n \n15.  The  recently  approved  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  between  the \nGovernment and the ADB also identifies several strategies to reduce poverty: (i) sustainable \ngrowth,  by  reforming  agricultural  research  and  extension,  increasing  private  investment  in \nagricultural  processing,  agricultural  market  support,  improving  financial  infrastructure,  and \nencouraging a competitive domestic private sector; (ii) inclusive social development through \nsecondary education and primary health care interventions; (iii) improved governance through \npublic administration reform; and (iv) regional focus on the central region. This agreement is \nconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \napproved in 2002. \n \n16.  Given the Government\u2019s, ADB\u2019s and other aid agencies\u2019 planned programs in irrigation, \nforestry, land markets and tenure,6 rural poverty reduction, and rural infrastructure, the proposed \nAgriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) will focus on gaps in science and technology, \ntechnology  transfer,  increased  quality  and  value-added  production  through  SME \nagroprocessing,  and  market  information.  Major  opportunities  exist  to  increase  agricultural \nproductivity, growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of agricultural outputs and value-added \nproducts, which will lead to sustainable increases in rural incomes. A major factor in increasing \nagricultural productivity is the application of science and technology. New technologies in the \nform of higher-yielding seeds, improved animal husbandry, and integrated pest management \nresult in higher productivity and, where appropriate market conditions exist, higher income. \nStrategies  for  raising  agricultural  productivity,  particularly  for  poor  households,  include  (i) \nrestructuring and expanding public support for agricultural research, (ii) expanding access to \ncredit in a sustainable way, (iii) improving seed quality through agricultural research and seed \ncertification, (iv) increasing labor productivity through training and extension, and (v) improving \nmarket intelligence. \n \n17.  In  the  long  term,  Viet  Nam  must  develop  a  highly  competent  agricultural  research \nsystem that can develop and adapt cutting-edge technology. This requires (i) clear roles and \nresponsibilities of research institutes to avoid duplication; (ii) increased funding; (iii) increased \ntraining, both degree and nondegree; (iv) increased autonomy in research center management \nand  decision  making;  (v)  reduced  focus  on  commercial  activities  and  increased  focus  on \ndeveloping  new  technologies;  (vi)  rationalization  of  the  research  system,  consolidation  of \ninstitutes, and more regional focus within Viet Nam; (vii) improved feedback from extension \nagents and farmer representatives to researchers on the value of ongoing research and on the \n                                                 \n6  The Swedish  International Development Cooperation  Agency (Sida)  has been assisting the Government in \nimplementing land reform for the past 5 years, and is planning an extension of grant assistance for another 5 years \n(2002-2007) to assist in developing and implementing the proposed new land law (expected by mid-2003). The \nWorld Bank is also considering a possible loan to help implement the new land law. The draft of the new law \nincludes such measures as increasing the agricultural land ceiling size from 2\u20133 hectares (ha) to 10 ha, tenure \nfrom 20 years to 50 years, access by women, rent and exchange of land, joint farming, and issuing land certificates \nto all eligible households. \n   \n \n ", "6   \ndemand for research in new areas; and (viii) increased use of competitive grants for funding \nresearch. \n \n18.  Improving the productivity of agricultural labor is one of the most important strategies for \nraising rural standards of living. Increasing labor productivity will raise the incomes of the \nmajority of the rural poor. In the medium and long run, the extension service should adopt the \nfollowing features: (i) increase the size of the extension service to fill gaps at the commune \nlevel, primarily in the remote and mountainous areas; (ii) increase staff training, with focus on a \nbroader range of topics, including group-based participatory methods, farm management, post-\nharvest  processing,  storage,  marketing,  and  credit;  (iii)  increase  the  proportion  of  female \nextension agents and agents from ethnic minorities, and targeting of the rural poor; (iv) increase \nfunding for the extension service with the aim of increasing the size of operating budgets and, to \nthe extent possible, increasing remuneration; (v) increase the role of the private sector in \ntraining  extension  workers,  setting  priorities  for  public  extension  activities,  and  supporting \nfarmers in appropriate input use; and (vi) establish extension advisory boards to evaluate and \nimprove the extension services, and provide feedback from mass organizations, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and private sector input suppliers.  \n \n19.  Facilitating the growth of rural and agricultural SMEs and improving their efficiency to \nincrease the value of agricultural and rural-based production and to stimulate growth in rural \nemployment, present an opportunity to increase the investment and participation of private \nenterprises and decrease the dominant role of SOEs in processing, marketing, and exporting \ncrops such as rice, coffee, rubber, and tea.7 The Government is not only reducing the access of \nSOEs to preferential credit and land, and requiring SOEs to be self-supporting, but also actively \npromoting SME development by (i) improving access to credit through state-owned commercial \nbanks; (ii) rapidly expanding access to state land in the form of rural industrial parks, rented out \nwith the provision of infrastructure (roads, electricity, water, etc.); and (iii) simplifying taxation of \nSME and cracking down on corruption and fraud of public officials. Government activities to \nfacilitate growth in private investment include financial services, market information, export \npromotion, establishing grades and standards, inspection services, disease control, strategic \nand  applied  research,  and  improved  management  of  the  natural  resource  base  on  which \nproduction and rural SME activities depend. \n \n20.  The long-run objective for agricultural credit is to develop a sustainable system that \nmobilizes  savings  from  rural  and  urban  households  and  provides  unsubsidized  credit  to \nhouseholds and enterprises on the basis of the quality of the proposed investment and the risks \nassociated with the loan. In the short and medium terms, VBARD requires more flexibility in \nsetting interest rates so as to profitably lend to an expanded set of borrowers. It also requires \nrecapitalization and reimbursement for eligible nonperforming loans. The Government should \ndiscontinue the practice of directing loans to SOEs.8 \n \n21.  Market intelligence, which is required to make markets more competitive, will benefit \nmainly SMEs, small traders, and farmers. A market information system at retail and wholesale \n                                                 \n7  The World Bank and IMF are taking the lead among aid agencies to assist with privatizing, equitizing, and \nreforming SOEs. \n8  IMF and World Bank assistance with reforming and restructuring the four state-owned commercial banks, including \nVBARD, under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the Poverty Reduction Support Credit, includes \n(i) recapitalization, (ii) reimbursement to the banks for nonperforming and directed loans, and (iii) removal of \ndirected lending to SOEs. ADB and the World Bank have been assisting VBARD with providing financial services \nto rural households, farmers, and very small enterprises. The World Bank is proposing a $200 million loan in 2002 \nfor this target group. \n   \n \n ", "  7\nlevels will (i) gather prices from a large number of domestic and international markets for all of \nthe  main  commodities;  (ii)  provide  analysis  of  the  recent  trends\u2014on  bulletin  boards  and \nchalkboards at the village and local market levels\u2014changes from a year ago after adjustment \nfor inflation, and the relationship between domestic prices and corresponding world prices; and \n(iii) disseminate the information through newspapers, magazines, radio, extension agents, and \nthe Internet. Improvements in the existing system implemented by MARD will include (i) more \nfeedback from users; (ii) more precision on the quality, the types of markets, and the scale \n(wholesale or retail) to help users interpret price movements better; (iii) more analysis of the \ntrends; and (iv) greater dissemination of long term trends and volatility through the extension \nservice.  \n \n22.  Sustainable growth of the agriculture sector is a prerequisite for economic growth and \npoverty reduction in Viet Nam. Despite progress in agricultural production and export growth \nand in liberalizing commodity, land, and credit markets in recent years, rural poverty remains \nhigh and private sector investment remains small. Growth in the past was the result of (i) \nreliance on higher input use (labor, capital, and water); (ii) policy reforms in land, markets, and \ntrade; and (iii) high public investment, mainly in the form of irrigation and roads. The annual \nsector growth of about 6% over the past decade was largely attributed to increased use of labor \n(14%), land (11%), basic intermediate inputs such as fertilizer (51%), tractors (14%), and water \npumps for irrigation (5%), with total factor productivity through other technology accounting for \nonly 4%.9 Thus, the sector strategy of the 1990s will not be able to sustain growth in the future \nbecause (i) the potential for expanding the rural labor force and land under cultivation is limited; \n(ii) new investment in irrigation exhibits decreasing marginal returns as the stock of irrigation \ncapital is already very high and requires increased operation, maintenance, and management in \naddition to new expansion for irrigation, water supply, and flood control; and (iii) rice export \nrevenue is declining due to poor quality and dependence on low-end markets. Viet Nam is \nalready  experiencing  difficulties  in  competition  for  markets  in  rice,  coffee,  and  other \nunprocessed commodities. \n \n23.  A new strategy is needed to sustain agricultural growth in the future. Future growth will \ndepend on growth in productivity, diversification, quality improvement, and emphasis on related \ntechnology. The Government\u2019s strategy for 2001-2010, supported by ADB and other sources, is \nthe  plan  for  agriculture  in  Viet  Nam.  Policy  makers  in  the  Government  are  interested  in \nsustaining growth, employment, and exports in agriculture so as to reduce rural poverty. The \nstrategy includes effecting policy reforms for commercial agriculture, livestock, water resources, \nand forestry. Policy reforms in the development and use of technologies through research and \nextension and improved access to credit by SMEs are expected to (i) improve yields; (ii) foster \ndiversification into available markets for higher value crops; (iii) improve the quality of products \nsuch as rice, coffee, livestock products, fruits, and vegetables that respond to and meet the \nrequirements of specific, well-targeted domestic and export markets; (iv) increase value-added \nproduction (e.g., processed and packaged cashew, rice noodles, and brand name tea and \ncoffee);  and  (v)  expand  rural  industries,  infrastructure,  and  services.  With  increased \nunderstanding of and responsiveness to different markets, competitiveness in export markets is \nexpected to improve. The consequence\u2014increased employment, and reduced indebtedness \nand sales of landholdings\u2014will have beneficial impacts on rural poverty. \n \n24.  Major factors contributing to low agricultural productivity, quality, and diversity include \nlimited (i) understanding of potential market opportunities, (ii) access to appropriate research \n                                                 \n9  ANZDEC. 2001. Explaining Agricultural Growth in Viet Nam. Prepared for ADB under TA 3223-VIE: Agriculture \nSector Program, New Zealand. \n   \n \n ", "8   \nand extension, (iii) access of the private sector to financial services and market information, and \n(iv) investment in new enterprises. Increased investments and improvements in the quality of \nagricultural  research  and  extension  will  improve  crop  diversification,  integration  with  post-\nharvest  systems,  quality  of  production,  and  stakeholder  participation.  A  key  source  of \nsustainable agricultural growth will be technological change leading to levels of productivity and \nquality  that  are  comparable  with  those  of  neighboring  countries.  Effective  use  of  these \ntechnologies, which include new as well as long-standing proven methods currently little used in \nViet Nam, requires access to inputs and capital, and knowledge and application of improved \nmanagement  practices  and  production  processes.  In  the  past  decade,  agricultural  growth \nfocused more on crop intensification than on crop diversification, and on total production rather \nthan on crop profitability and quality. In the next decade, with globalization and increased \ncompetition with other countries, the focus must be on agricultural diversification and improved \nproduct  quality.  Specific  institutional  policy  reforms  will  be  required  to  address  major \nweaknesses in agricultural research and extension. Agricultural research institutions have not \nyet  reacted  flexibly  to market  needs.  Current  government  policy  has  not  provided  enough \nincentives to researchers, and they have major financing needs. The agricultural extension \nsystem has poor linkages with research programs and uses a top-down methodology. It does \nnot address its small farmer client needs, and is understaffed and poorly trained. It makes poor \nuse  of  mass  media  and  communications,  and  also  has  funding  gaps.  Reforms  in  these \ninstitutions will facilitate investments in human resources and infrastructure that will allow a \nmore significant contribution to agricultural growth than in the past. \n \n25.  Private enterprises wishing to expand their operations are seriously constrained by lack \nof credit and market information. To take advantage of value-added market opportunities, the \nGovernment will need to more actively support trade promotion and assist the private sector with \nproduct-specific market research. Capacity building for MARD and the provincial and improved \ncoordination in trade promotion functions (including market analysis, exhibitions, and information \non  export  and  import  requirements)  are  needed.  Previous  projects  have  not  adequately \naddressed the financial needs of these SMEs, except for microenterprises and very small SMEs \nunder previous ADB financing. The provision of market information and medium- and long-term \nfunds will facilitate and accelerate investment in agro-industry. It will also encourage the adoption \nof new technologies crucial to the success of these enterprises in a competitive environment. \nProgram  reforms  and  investments  intend  to  provide  the  SMEs  with  agricultural  market \ninformation, increase access to medium- and long-term credit, and encourage the development \nof SMEs in agro-industry. \n \n26.  VBARD, the leading commercial bank in rural areas, recently started lending to private \nSMEs. Its new strategy, consistent with the Government\u2019s 10-year development plan, is to \nsupport SMEs while reducing lending over time to SOEs. By supporting VBARD, the Program \nwill be able to reach a major share of existing and potential agro-industry SMEs and partially \naddress the financing gap. Credit to SMEs will facilitate the adoption of relevant technologies \ngenerated by the research institutes and promoted by the extension service. VBARD needs \npolicy reforms to strengthen its financial performance and capacity to deliver sustainable credit \nand expand services to SMEs. The relatively high level of liquidity in the banking system in Viet \nNam is mainly due to short-term deposits. Medium-term and long-term funds are needed for \ninvestments. Funds provided by ASDP will meet this need, as well as improve the balance \nbetween  short-term  and  long-term  funds  in  the  banking  sector.  ASDP  will  help  create  an \nenvironment  conducive  to  business  expansion.  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  foster  more  balanced  and \ndiversified portfolios in VBARD and help make it less risk exposed. Being long-term, ADB funds \nwill  strengthen  VBARD  financially  by  reducing  its  duration  and  interest-variation  risks  and \nimproving its fund management. \n   \n \n ", "  9\n27.  The Information Center for Agriculture and Rural Development (ICARD) will have a \nsignificant role in filling the gap in market information. ICARD has conducted pilot studies in a \nnumber of districts, communes, and villages and have done follow-up surveys to assess how \nmuch information the target groups have actually received and whether the information was \nuseful.  The  percentage  of  users  receiving  the  information  has  rapidly  increased  and  its \nusefulness is apparent. Bulletin boards and chalkboards have been found to be the most \nsuccessful means of disseminating price and market information to most farmers and retailers \n(Appendix 1). ICARD also has a web site that is kept current and is used to help prepare daily \nbulletin  board  updates.  By  supporting  ICARD,  the  Program  will  provide  price  and  market \ninformation and analysis in collaboration with private sector marketing agents to encourage \ndiversification  into  high-value  commodities  and  products,  including  those  with  high  export \npotential. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n28.  The Program has been designed to assist the Government address declining growth in \nthe  agriculture  sector  and  rural  economy  by  addressing  key  constraints  to  agricultural \nproductivity and competitiveness. Beneficiaries will have opportunities to increase incomes and \nemployment  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  through  access  to  strengthened  and  more \nresponsive agricultural support services and capital. Private sector agro-industries will receive \nincentives to increase investment and employment through improved access to capital. The \nobjectives of the Program will be to facilitate increases in agricultural productivity, profitability, \nand competitiveness in domestic and export markets by increasing the capacity of research and \nextension  to  deliver  relevant  technology,  improving  access  to  information,  and  increasing \naccess of private sector SMEs to capital. The expected outcomes are increased agricultural \ndiversification, improved postharvest systems, reduced vulnerability of rural households, and \ngreater participation of rural households in sector development efforts. ASDP includes specific \nreform measures to (i) strengthen support services in science and technology (research and \nextension);  and  (ii)  promote  the  development  of  agro-industry  SMEs.10  The  chronology  of \ndesigning ASDP is in Appendix 2. \n \n29.  ASDP consists of two components with common objectives: (i) a program or policy \nreform loan, and (ii) a project or agro-industry SME loan. Policy reforms in research, extension, \nmarket information, and financial services to agro-industry SMEs are required to implement the \nGovernment\u2019s 10-year (2001-2010) development strategy and to permit meaningful investments \nin science and technology, and private sector SME development. The project loan, consisting of \nfinancial support to VBARD to provide medium- and long-term credit for the rapidly expanding \nagro-industry SMEs, is consistent with the Program\u2019s objectives and is required to help meet the \nrapidly growing demand for SME financial services. \n \nB.  The Program Loan \n1.  Objectives \n30.  The goals of the program loan are to assist the Government increase agricultural growth \non a sustainable basis, create employment opportunities, and reduce poverty in the rural areas. \n                                                 \n10 Government Decree no. 90 of 2001 defines SMEs as having registered capital of less than D10 billion ($660,000) \nor permanent employees of less than 300. \n   \n \n ", "10   \nIts specific objective is to increase agricultural productivity, profitability, and competitiveness by \nrestructuring  the  management  of  agricultural  science  and  technology,  improving  market \nintelligence, phasing out commercial seed subsidies, and encouraging the development of agro-\nindustry SMEs through improved access to credit. The development policy letter describing the \nGovernment\u2019s reform measures and the proposed policy matrix are in Appendix 3. The program \nframework is in Appendix 4. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n31.  The  program  loan  has  two  components:  (i)  strengthening  science  and  technology \n(agricultural research and extension) and (ii) promoting agro-industry SME development. \n \na.  Strengthening Science and Technology \n32.  Agricultural  Research.  As  a  first-tranche  condition,  MARD  will  have  approved  an \nagricultural research reorganization plan that is in substance acceptable to ADB and which is \nbased on the Borrower\u2019s Master Plan for Agricultural Research prepared with the assistance of \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Following the Master Plan, (i) the number of \nresearch institutes and centers are reduced to about 25, including 2 new regional centers\u2014for \nthe central coast and northern highland agroecological regions\u2014are created; (ii) the functions \nand responsibilities of each institute are clarified and duplications eliminated to ensure more \nfocus on important agricultural problems in food crops, perennial and cash crops, livestock, \npostharvest and engineering systems, soil and water resources, forestry, and agricultural policy; \n(iii)  standards  and  performance-based  evaluation  of  agricultural  research  institute  staff  are \nestablished to provide financial and other rewards to good performers;11 and (iv) prioritize \nagricultural research toward more adaptive on-farm research which should be undertaken in a \nparticipatory manner involving extension staff and farmers. The plan should also propose how to \ndeal with the surplus staff that will result from the reorganization of the agricultural research \ninstitutes and centers.  \n \n33.  Also  as  first-tranche  conditions,  (i)  MARD  will  have  issued  regulatory  instructions, \nacceptable to ADB, to the research institutes to phase out commercial activities, including the \nmass  production  and  sale  of  certified  seed,  allowing  only  the  sale  of  breeder\u2019s seed  and \nfoundation seeds (pre-basic and basic seed) to private and public seed companies; (ii) the \nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) and MARD will have established a system of \ncompetitive grants for agricultural research institutes, with rationalized criteria for the award of \ngrants; and (iii) MARD will have issued regulations, acceptable to ADB, giving agricultural \nresearch institutes and centers autonomy to effectively carry out research, obtain funding from \nsources  other  than  the  national  budget,  provide  financial  incentives  to  research  staff,  and \ndevelop personnel and administrative policy in accordance with their autonomy status. MARD \nwill  develop  a  system  of  governance  to  ensure  that  the  results  from  research  autonomy \nappropriately reflect national goals. Available TA may be used as needed. In addition, to provide \nan adequate recurrent and operating budget to agricultural research institutes and centers, the \nGovernment will submit a national budget for 2003 that increases allocations for agricultural \nresearch at a rate of at least 12%. \n \n                                                 \n11 MARD will actively seek opportunities for study-abroad programs to better prepare its research staff for service \nunder the restructured research system. Potential aid sources, such as those mentioned in para. 56, should be \ncontacted. \n   \n \n ", " 11\n34.  As  second-tranche  conditions,  MARD  will  have  started  implementing  the  agricultural \nresearch reorganization plan by (i) consolidating the research institutes and centers to about 25 \n(including two new regional institutes); (ii) defining the responsibilities of the regional centers, for \nimproved development of farming systems appropriate to their region; and (iii) preparing a plan \nacceptable to the Government and ADB to further reduce the number of research institutes to \nan appropriate number based on the priorities established by MARD. Also, MARD will have (i) \ncompleted  the  phaseout  of  commercial  activities  (i.e.,  the  sale  of  certified  seed)  by  the \nagricultural research institutes; (ii) issued at least 10 competitive grants to research institutes; \n(iii) approved a human resource development plan to strengthen agricultural research over the \nnext 5\u201310 years; and (iv) pilot-tested a rural system for integrated research and extension to \nincrease rural incomes and livelihood at one of its regional research institutes in the central \nregion.  Also,  the  Government  will continue  to  increase  the  national  budget  for  agricultural \nresearch in 2004 at the rate of at least 12%. \n \n35.  As third-tranche conditions, (i) the reorganization, consolidation, and restructuring of the \nagricultural research institutes will have been completed according to the agricultural research \nreorganization plan, and all staff affected either placed in the surplus pool for reassignment to \nother government agencies or provided a severance package consistent with the Government\u2019s \nResolution no. 16 of 18 October 2000; (ii) MARD will have implemented the approved plan for \nstaff standards and performance-based evaluation; (iii) the research institutes will have started \noperations as autonomous organizations; and (iv) the Government will continue to increase the \nnational budget for agricultural research in 2005 at the rate of at least 12%. The Government \nhas agreed to sustain this level of financing in the future, consistent with the approved 10-year \ndevelopment plan (2001-2010). \n \n36.  Agricultural Extension. As a first-tranche condition, MARD will have issued to at least \n20 provincial governments, operational guidelines for establishing provincial extension advisory \ncouncils  to  provide  a  forum  for  stakeholder  participation  in  the  preparation  of  extension \nprograms and other related activities. Council representation will include farmers\u2019 and growers' \nassociations,  mass  organizations,  cooperatives,  local  research  institutes,  extension  staff, \nVBARD, NGOs, private sector input suppliers, and staff from DAFE, planning, land, finance, \nscience and technology, and trade. Also, MARD will have issued a regulation to contract out \nsome extension services to NGOs, universities, farmers\u2019 organizations, private companies, input \nsuppliers, and agribusinesses where possible. Also as a first-tranche condition, the Government \nwill submit a national budget for 2003 that increases extension allocation at the rate of at least \n12% to provide an adequate recurrent and operating budget to agricultural extension. \n \n37.  The  budget  increases  and  increase  in  extension  staff  at  the  commune  level  are \nconsistent with the proposed ADB-financed Public Administration Reform Program. Currently in \nits design phase, this reform program is proposing that rightsizing of government is more \nappropriate than downsizing in Viet Nam\u2019s context. In the longer run, mechanical downsizing \ncannot be the singular aim. Instead, the numbers and skills of civil servants must be adapted to \nemerging new responsibilities, functions, structures, and organization of the Government. The \nnet impact of budget increases under ASDP will be minimal on the national budgets. \n \n38.  As a second-tranche condition, the provincial extension advisory councils will have been \nestablished  in  at  least  20  provinces.  MARD  and  representatives  of  all  the  provincial \ngovernments will have approved a joint plan for extension work, acceptable to ADB, that (i) \ndevelops extension strategies and priorities that focus extension efforts in remote and upland \nareas  where  there  are  large  numbers  of  poor  farmers;  (ii)  strengthens  linkages  between \nresearch and extension; (iii) redirects training of extension staff toward a new set of skills \n   \n \n ", "12   \nincluding  participatory  extension  methodology,  marketing,  postharvest  activities,  and  rural \nfinance; (iv) institutionalizes the participatory approach12 in extension services in which farmers \nwill increasingly participate in planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating of extension \nactivities; (v) expands the provision of extension services at the district and commune levels, \nparticularly in poor provinces, by hiring an additional 5,000 extension staff to fill vacancies at the \ncommune level;13 (vi) increases funding to train extension staff and farmers; and (vii) improves \ndelivery of extension services to the poor, women, and ethnic groups by increasing the number \nof female and ethnic minority staff by at least 10% in each category over a period of 36 months. \n \n39.  ASDP gender-specific actions, such as increasing the recruitment of female extension \nagents, will be coordinated and consistent with the gender strategy of MARD and the sector \nbeing developed with ADB assistance.14 Increasing the number of women and ethnic minority \nstaff in the extension service is considered appropriate and realistic, given the limited, but \ngrowing, levels of qualified candidates at the commune level. Although the number of women \nand ethnic minority secondary graduates from agricultural universities is very small, it has been \ngrowing  in  recent  years  due  to  (i)  increasing  education  possibilities  in  the  remote  and \nmountainous areas, (ii) more active recruitment for extension agents in these areas, and (iii) \nincreased interest of women and ethnic peoples in extension jobs. \n \n40.  Also as second-tranche conditions, (i) multiple or pluralistic extension services will be \noperating in at least five provinces; (ii) MARD will have issued a regulation/circular to reorganize \nthe Department of Agriculture and Forestry Extension by transferring its National Extension \nCenter (NEC) to a separate entity so that it will be solely responsible for agricultural extension; \n(iii) MARD in cooperation with local authorities, will have issued a regulation/circular establishing \nprovincial-level  teams  of  subject  matter  specialists,  comprising  experts  in  agronomy, \nhorticulture, soil fertility, crop protection, livestock production, forestry, farm management and \nsociology, to assist the extension staff in providing advisory services to farmers\u2019 groups and in \ntraining extension staff in specific skills; and (iv) the Government will continue to increase the \nnational budget for agricultural extension in 2004 at the rate of at least 12%.  \n \n41.  As third-tranche conditions, (i) provincial agricultural advisory councils will have been \nestablished in about 20 more provinces; (ii) the participatory extension approach will have been \nimplemented in at least 40 communes in 40 districts in at least 10 provinces; (iii) provincial \ngovernments will have hired an additional 1,000 extension workers, at least 10% of whom will \nbe women and 10% from ethnic minorities, to fill vacancies at the commune level; (iv) about \n1,000 staff will have trained in various fields, including participatory extension methodology, \nmarketing, postharvest activities, and rural finance; (v) multiple extension services will have \nexpanded to cover at least 10 provinces; (vi)  teams of subject matter specialists will have been \nestablished  in  at  least  10  provinces;  (vii)  NEC  will  have  been  established  and  become \noperational;  and  (viii)  the  Government  will  continue  to  increase  the  national  budget  for \nagricultural extension in 2005 at the rate of at least 12%. The Government has agreed to \nsustain this level of financing in the future, consistent with the approved 10-year development \nplan (2001-2010). \n \n                                                 \n12 Participatory approaches that have been well tested in Viet Nam during recent years include the participatory \nagricultural extension methodology, participatory village planning and management, agricultural extension clubs, \nand farmer interest groups. The extension service can adopt any one of these approaches. \n13 The people's committees at the district and commune levels will be responsible for recruiting and funding these \ncommune-level extension workers, and there will be no cost implications to the Government. \n14 ADB. 2002.

As a first-tranche condition, MARD will have approved a plan, acceptable to ADB, to \nestablish and strengthen an agricultural market information system (AMIS) that links provinces \nand districts, and includes market demand and risk analysis for trade promotion. The system will \nalso allow feedback of market needs and issues to agricultural research. The plan will include (i) \na strategy for establishing the AMIS; and (ii) outputs, activities, monitoring indicators, cost \nestimates,  cost  recovery,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  phased  investment  in  the \nestablishment of an AMIS in the country. Also as first-tranche conditions, MARD will have (i) \nterminated subsidies on hybrid maize seed; (ii) issued letters to the four provinces that currently \nsubsidize the commercial production of hybrid rice to terminate the subsidy, and the provinces \nwill have terminated the subsidy; and (iii) issued letters to the 18 provinces that currently \nsupport poverty reduction for poor farmers through subsidized hybrid rice seeds, indicating that \n(a) the subsidy be limited to poor farmers identified in the commune list of poor farmers; (b) the \nsubsidy to the same farmer will be phased out over a 3-crop period; and (c) the amount used for \nthe subsidy should be limited and the funds should be used for extension. MARD will monitor to \nensure that no province will subsidize commercial production of hybrid rice or maize. The \nsavings from subsidies will enable the staff to focus on group-based extension activities and to \nredirect expenditures in the field to higher priority extension activities. \n \n43.  Consistent with international banking norms, the Government and VBARD are committed \nto increase and maintain a CAR of at least 8%. However, the Government proposes that this \nrequirement be achieved over several years in conformity with the IMF/World Bank policy letter \non restructuring state-owned commercial banks, including VBARD. As first-tranche conditions, \n(i) the Government will have paid into VBARD additional legal capital of no less than D480 \nbillion; (ii) VBARD will have appropriately classified its loans and adequately provisioned for \nexpected loan losses and solvency requirements consistent with SBV Decision 488;15 and (iii) \nVBARD will have provided commercial loans at interest rates negotiated between VBARD and \nits borrowers.  \n \n44.  As  second-tranche  conditions,  (i)  MARD  and  the  provincial  governments  will  have \nestablished the AMIS in at least 50 districts within 10 provinces; and (ii) the Government will \nhave increased VBARD\u2019s legal capital to no less than D1.44 trillion. As third-tranche conditions, \n(i) MARD and the provincial governments will have expanded the AMIS to cover another 50 \ndistricts within 10 provinces; and (ii) MARD will have terminated subsidies for the commercial \nproduction of hybrid rice seeds, and the funds used instead for the transfer of hybrid rice seed \ntechnology through extension activities. Also as third-tranche conditions, the Government will \nhave (i) increased VBARD\u2019s legal capital to no less than D1.92 trillion, and (ii) provided financial \nsupport  to  VBARD  for  VBARD  to  forgive  eligible  nonperforming  loans  identified  as  of \n                                                 \n15 SBV Decision 488 of 27 November 2000 from SBV relates to categories of nonperforming or overdue loans and \nprovisioning to recover or retire these loans. \n   \n \n ", "14   \n31 December 2000 in accordance with Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 149 of 5 November 200116 \non resolving the nonperforming loans of state-owned commercial banks. \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n45.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $60 million equivalent denominated in Special \nDrawing Rights from its Special Funds resources for ASDP, with a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan will finance the policy reforms in three tranches over a 3-\nyear period, from January 2003 to December 2005. This amount was determined through ADB\u2019s \ncontinued dialogue with the Government and the size of the short-term adjustment costs of \nimplementing the Program. Use of low-cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources is justified \nin support of policy reforms that address complex and long-standing issues and socially significant \nmeasures to (i) enhance benefits to small farmers; (ii) free government resources currently used \nin subsidies; and (iii) improve the terms of trade for agriculture on which the livelihood of the \nmajority of the households, especially the poor, depend. In addition, the adjustment costs to \nimplement the Program are substantial. \n \n46.  An  estimated  net  adjustment  cost  of  about  $90  million  is  required  to  catalyze  the \nchanges to enhance productivity and profitability in the agriculture sector through the proposed \nreform measures. Reforming the research and extension institutions will involve restructuring \nthe research organization and expanding the commune-level extension services. The services \nmust be realigned to support the needs of farmers at the subsistence level and at different \nlevels of commercialization through participatory processes, and to improve coverage within the \nmajor  agroecological  zones.  This  will  involve,  initially,  increased  recurrent  expenditure  for \nresearch and extension to cover operating expenses (training and facilities improvements are to \nbe covered under a subsequent investment phase). The loan will help the Government to adjust \nits recurrent budget to meet these incremental expenses. After the loan period, the Government \nwill be fully responsible for maintaining the research and extension recurrent budget at its new \nlevel. The adjustment costs include (i) $42 million for increasing the Government\u2019s budgetary \nsupport for restructuring and modernizing the research and extension systems, and (ii) $49 \nmillion for Government\u2019s contributions to improve the asset quality of VBARD to resolve debts \non nonperforming loans. These costs represent less than 2% of the annual capital budget of the \nnational and local governments for agriculture by during 2003\u20132007, and 1% of the average \nannual budget for all state-owned commercial banks during 2003\u20132007.  \n \n                                                 \n16 Nonperforming loans are defined as loans classified under groups 3 and 4 according to SBV Decision 488 of \n27 November  2000,  unless  otherwise  amended  by  SBV.  Decision  149  provides  general  principles  on \nnonperforming loan resolution. Specifically, nonperforming loans are categorized into three types: (i) those with \ncollateral, (ii) those without collateral owned by operative debtors, and (iii) those without collateral owned by \nnonoperative debtors. In the first category of nonperforming loans, creditors (e.g., VBARD) can sell the assets to \nasset management companies, auction them in an auction center, or liquidate the assets. In the second category, \nthe creditor can sell the debt to a third party, conduct a debt-equity swap, reschedule the debt, reduce the interest \nrate, or provide debtors with additional funds. The creditor can also reevaluate the true value of the debt. The \ndifference  between  the  true  and  nominal  value  will  be  submitted  to  relevant  authorities  for  forgiving  the \nnonperforming loan. In the third category, the creditor will classify the nonperforming loan and report to SBV and \nthe Government for forgiving the loan and recapitalization. \n   \n \n ", " 15\n4.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Program Management \n47.  MARD will be the Executing Agency and will (i) coordinate with the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), and \nVBARD on the policy reforms; and (ii) oversee compliance with the tranche conditions. MOF will \nbe  responsible  for  administering  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  the  Borrower  will  be \nresponsible for requesting tranche releases from ADB. MARD will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation, including monitoring the implementation of the Program and use of counterpart \nfunds, and evaluating the impact of the reforms on stakeholders. MARD has established a \nprogram  implementation  unit  (PIU),  appointed  a  program  director  and  a  deputy  program \ndirector,  and  established  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  MARD.  The \ncommittee comprises senior staff from MARD, MOF, MPI, SBV, and VBARD and will meet at \nleast quarterly. The steering committee will ensure that the reforms are undertaken in line with \nthe  agreed-upon  timetable.  The  PIU  will  have  the  following  minimum  key  personnel:  (i)  a \nprogram director to oversee program implementation and policy reforms, and (ii) a deputy \nprogram director from MARD's Agricultural Projects Management Board to monitor and evaluate \nthe implementation of the policy reforms. The PIU will have the following functions: (i) submit \nsemiannual  reports  to  ADB  and  MARD  on  progress  and  issues  relating  to  program \nimplementation; (ii) coordinate, monitor, and supervise program implementation; and (iii) assess \nthe impact of the Program. Both the steering committee and the PIU will coordinate activities \nwith MARD's existing science and technology and trade promotion advisory committees. \n \nb.  Implementation Period  \n48.  Implementation will last for 3 years, beginning in April 2003 and ending in March 2006. \n \nc.  Procurement and Disbursement \n49.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 5). The Government \nwill certify that (i) if the loan proceeds will finance goods already imported, the value of eligible \nimports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) if the \nloan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately \npreceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal \nplus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the  succeeding  1-year  period. \nProcurement will be based on normal commercial practice for the private sector and government \nprocedures for the public sector. \n \nd.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  The use of the loan proceeds will be audited only upon ADB\u2019s request, provided that ADB \nretains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by the \nGovernment for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open an \naccount at a commercial bank, acceptable to ADB, to receive all loan proceeds. The Government \nwill manage, operate, and liquidate the account in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The \nPIU will submit to ADB and MARD semiannual progress reports on the progress of completing the \npolicy reform measures, and also brief monthly reports. MARD will submit a program completion \nreport within 3 months after program completion. \n \n   \n \n ", "16   \ne.  Counterpart Funds \n51.  The Government has agreed to use the local currency proceeds of the program loan to \nsupport reforms in the agriculture sector. Counterpart funds will not be used to support SOEs. \n \nf.  Tranching and Monitoring \n52.  The proposed program loan will be released in three tranches. The first tranche of $20 \nmillion equivalent will be available for release upon loan effectiveness, subject to full compliance \nwith the first-tranche conditions. The second tranche of $20 million equivalent will be released \napproximately 18 months later, after the Government\u2019s due compliance with the second-tranche \nconditions. The third tranche of $20 million equivalent will be released within 36 months of the \nfirst tranche after the Government\u2019s due compliance with the third-tranche conditions. The \nGovernment and ADB will closely monitor actions related to the tranche conditions jointly. \n \n53.  MARD,  through  the  PIU  and  its  concerned  departments,  will  collect  benchmark  or \nbaseline data at the start of the Program. Both the Government and ADB will regularly and \nclosely monitor the implementation of the Program. The policy actions and their outcomes will \nbe monitored. Specific program performance indicators have been developed to assist with \nmonitoring. Program impact and outcome will be assessed, particularly from the perspective of \nproductivity  gains  for  farmers,  increased  SME  investment  and  employment,  increased \ntechnology and genetic material production and dissemination, and consumption patterns of the \nurban and rural poor due to shifts in the market prices of staple food items. Mechanisms to \nmonitor these will be assigned to independent research agencies to be appointed by MARD. \n \ng.  Program Performance Management System \n54.  MARD will establish and maintain the program performance management system that \nwill include a database of the status of policy reform measures, program indicators, etc., and \nimpact of the policy reform measures at the sector and stakeholder levels. \n \nh.  Program Review \n55.  The Government, MARD, and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the \nend of year 2 of the Program to evaluate the impact of the reform measures on beneficiaries \nand the sector overall, and the performance of the PIU. ADB will conduct annual reviews \nthroughout the program implementation period. \n \ni.  Donor Coordination \n56.  Several multilateral and bilateral agencies are actively involved in research and extension, \nalthough most of their activities are very small and in the form of studies and limited grants for \ninternational scholarships. Only ADB is currently supporting SMEs in agriculture through financial \nservices. MARD\u2019s international support group is taking the lead in cooperation and information \nsharing, and ASDP will use this mechanism to continue coordinating with other agencies and to \nminimize duplication. FAO and several international agricultural research institutes are involved in \nagricultural research. Australia\u2019s Allwright Fellowship Scheme supports the Capacity Building for \nAgriculture and Rural Development program for degree training for research staff. The Center for \nInternational  Research  and  Development  (France),  ADB,  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ), and Danida also provide fellowships for international graduate degree \ntraining. Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), Danida, Swiss Agency \n   \n \n ", " 17\nfor  Development  and  Cooperation,  GTZ,  Netherlands  Development  Organization,  FAO,  and \nseveral international NGOs are very active in agricultural extension, using participatory group-\nbased approaches, extension clubs, and farmer field schools. Sida is also active in other areas \nrelevant to the proposed program, including land reform. The development coordination matrix is \nin Appendix 6. \n \nC.  The Project Loan \n1.  Objectives \n57.  The project loan will support the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty and promote \nprivate sector investments in agro-based SMEs by providing medium- and long-term credit. \nVBARD will target SMEs with up to 300 employees. Currently, the average loan size is about \n$100,000, ranging from about $20,000 to $500,000.17 No other commercial banks are currently \nassisting SMEs in the agriculture sector. SMEs in agriculture and the rural areas are expected \nto grow significantly. The demand for agro-industry SME credit during the project period is \nestimated at about $2.4 billion equivalent, of which VBARD plans to provide about 30%.18 \nVBARD has shown adequate capacity to provide credit to SMEs in previous lending operations. \nWith strengthened measures on financial prudence and SME operations, VBARD is expected to \nprovide further financial services successfully and profitably.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n58.  The project loan will provide funds for medium- and long-term loans to SMEs in agro-\nindustry.  The  Project  will  support  environmentally  sound  rural  businesses  to  improve \nproductivity,  enhance  product  quality,  and  generate  economic  growth  and  employment. \nPotential businesses cover broad categories of economic activities including (i) agricultural input \nproducers and suppliers; (ii) processors of fruits, vegetables, other horticultural crops, and \nindustrial  crops;  (iii)  processors  of  fish  and  livestock  products;  (iv)  services  such  as \nmechanization; (v) small-scale manufacturers producing goods such as baskets and bags, \nmats, furniture, woven products; and (vi) storage and marketing businesses. \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n59.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30 million equivalent denominated in Special \nDrawing Rights from its Special Funds resources to augment VBARD\u2019s own resources for \nlending to SMEs. ADB\u2019s support is proposed to provide term lending that is currently scarce in \nVBARD. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \nVBARD will provide matching funds of $6 million equivalent, so that the total loanable funds will \nbe $36 million equivalent. The beneficiaries (agro-industry SME borrowers) will contribute about \n20% own equity financing of the subproject cost in the form of labor, capital, and land. Detailed \nterms and conditions for subloan application are in paras. 62-66. \n                                                 \n17 Under Loan 1802-VIE(SF), clients are defined as those with less than 50 employees and whose average loan size \nis $7,500. \n18 The Appraisal Mission has estimated from available government data that there are currently about 87,000 \nregistered SMEs in Viet Nam, of which about 42% or 37,000 are registered agro-industry SMEs. The rate of growth \nof registered agro-industry SMEs is about 25% per year and this trend is expected to continue throughout the \nprogram period. The registered capital of these SMEs is currently about D36 trillion, and the estimated demand for \ncredit in 2002 is D8 trillion. The demand during the project period is estimated at D34 trillion ($2.4 billion). A \ndemand analysis has been prepared. \n   \n \n ", "18   \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Project Management \n60.  VBARD will be the Executing Agency for the project loan. VBARD has established a \nsuitably equipped and staffed PIU with a part-time director at its headquarters. The PIU will be \nthe focal point for all matters in implementing, managing, and coordinating the loan. The PIU will \nhave  the  following  minimum  key  personnel:  (i)  a  credit  officer  responsible  to  ensure  and \nfacilitate implementation of the credit line, (ii) an evaluation officer to monitor and evaluate loan \nimplementation, and (iii) a budget officer to prepare relevant withdrawal applications and submit \nperiodic reports to ADB. VBARD has over 1,300 branch offices at the provincial, district, and \ncommune levels and adequate staff to implement the Project.  \n \n61.  The PIU will be specifically responsible for (i) submitting withdrawal applications to ADB; \n(ii)  coordinating  and  consolidating  the  loan  reporting  requirements;  (iii)  overseeing  the \nimplementation of the various components; (iv) undertaking benefit monitoring and evaluation; \n(v) advertising the credit lines and supervising their implementation; (vi) conducting workshops \nto clarify the objectives, scope, targets, and implementation plans for the components of the \ninvestment; (vii) carrying out a midterm review and evaluation; and (viii) producing progress \nreports, project completion reports, and other reports as may reasonably be required by ADB \nduring implementation. \n \nb.  Relending and Onlending Terms and Conditions \n62.  The Borrower will relend the proceeds of the project loan in dong to VBARD to onlend to \neligible SMEs on medium and long terms, with a variable relending rate within a range between \nthe weighted average cost of time deposit funds and the average cost of funds for 12 months or \nmore of the banking system as computed and informed by SBV at the end of each quarter. The \nsubsidiary loan will be for a period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. VBARD will \nrepay principal and interest in equal semiannual installments to the Borrower. The Borrower will \nbear the foreign exchange risk for the loan. \n \n63.  Beginning with the line of credit, VBARD will establish a revolving fund, known as the \nAgro-industry SME Fund, totaling about $36 million equivalent (including $30 million equivalent \nof ADB financing) to onlend to eligible agro-industry SMEs. Proceeds from the repayment of the \nprincipal from the subloans will be used to maintain the revolving fund for onlending for the \nsame purposes and under the same terms and conditions as those for onlending the ADB credit \ninitially. VBARD will onlend the proceeds of the loan portion designated for the agro-industry \nSME credit line in local currency to eligible subborrowers at an interest rate that will cover cost \nof  funds,  operating  costs,  loan  loss,  and  interest  variation  risks.  VBARD  will  evaluate  all \nproposed enterprise subloans in accordance with its standard procedures, supplemented by a \ncash-flow and debt-service analysis. The subloan maturity will be consistent with the projected \nsubloan implementation period and debt-service capacity.  \n \nc.  Subloan Application and Approval \n64.  As prescribed in its loan sanctioning authority policy, VBARD will utilize its internal \ndiscretionary authorities for subloan approval. It is not envisaged that ADB\u2019s review of subloans \nfor approval is necessary, since almost all subloans will be within the authority of the district and \nprovincial branches to approve. For subloans above the authority of a VBARD provincial branch \n(D5 billion or $330,000 equivalent), the subloan appraisals will be evaluated at the respective \n   \n \n ", " 19\nhead office and the results submitted to ADB for review and concurrence. The loan will be \nimplemented in rural areas of Viet Nam, broadly defined to include communes, villages, and \nprovincial  and  district  towns  whose  economic  roles  and  functions  are  closely  linked  to \nagricultural and rural enterprises. Areas inside the municipal boundaries of the major cities of \nHanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, and Da Nang are excluded. Special consideration will be \ngiven to areas designated as the poorest in the country, with the objective of narrowing the gap \nin incomes and attaining sectoral and regional balance in growth. To ensure the effectiveness of \nVBARD,  the  Project  will  strengthen  it  through  training  in  lending  practices,  and  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \n65.  Each new or current subborrower must meet the following minimum criteria: (i) is a \nlegally established SME under Vietnamese law; (ii) if a current borrower, has a satisfactory \ncredit history with no current arrears or rescheduled borrowings; (iii) is able to contribute a \nminimum of 20% equity to the subproject; (iv) is a potentially profitable and environmentally \nsound rural or agro-based business primarily engaged in nonfarm activities (defined as activities \nthat do not involve primary agricultural production); (v) requires medium or long-term credit \nincluding semipermanent working capital for business start-up or growth; (vi) is in compliance \nwith the terms and conditions of any outstanding loan agreement; and (vii) is in  compliance with \nthe regulations of VBARD. \n \n66.  Each subproject must meet the following minimum criteria: (i) is located in a rural area; \n(ii) has the potential for creating new employment; (iii) does not involve any land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement effects; and (iv) will not have any adverse environmental consequence. \n \nd.  Procurement \n67.  Subborrowers will acquire goods and services for the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement by small private subborrowers (paras. 3.08 and 3.09). Procuring \nequipment  for  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  follow  International \nshopping procedures, while contracts costing less than $100,000 equivalent will involve direct \npurchase. \n \ne.  Implementation Period  \n68.  The project loan will be implemented over 3 years, 2003\u20132006. \n \nf.  Disbursement Arrangements \n69.  To ensure effective implementation and timely disbursement of the project loan, the \nBorrower will open a separate imprest account denominated in US dollars at a commercial bank \nto be designated by SBV, within 1 month of loan effectiveness. The imprest account will be \noperated  and  maintained  by  VBARD  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan \nDisbursements. ADB will advance 3 months of estimated expenditures into the imprest account \n(about $2.5 million).19 Direct foreign exchange payments or letters of credit, as well as local \ncurrency  expenditures  may  be  paid  out  of  the  imprest  account.  The  ADB  statement-of-\nexpenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for contracts \nor individual payments below $50,000. The Mission has reviewed the accounting systems of \n                                                 \n19\n The total advance to the imprest account at any point in time will not exceed the estimated expenditure of 6 months \nor 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \n   \n \n ", "20   \nVBARD and considers them adequate for the purpose of ADB\u2019s imprest account and statement-\nof- expenditure procedures. \n \ng.  Accounts, Audits, and Reports \n70.  VBARD  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  loan  and  its  overall  operations  and \nmanagement. The reports will include information on (i) expenditure for the different subprojects, \nby industry and subsector; (ii) credit disbursement, recoveries, overdue loans, outstanding loans, \nand status of revolving fund under the loan; and (iii) physical progress of the investment activities, \nincluding compliance with covenants. \n \n71.  VBARD will maintain separate records and accounts, adequate to identify goods and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and to disclose the use thereof in the project loan \nfollowing sound accounting principles. VBARD will have such accounts and records audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB, and will submit, within 9 months of the close of the \nfinancial  year, certified copies  of  the audit  report together with  the  auditor\u2019s opinion,  to  the \nGovernment and ADB. The imprest account and VBARD are also subject to annual audit. The \naudit reports should include a separate audit opinion, on the use of the imprest account and \nVBARD. Within 3 months after all subprojects are physically completed, VBARD will prepare and \nsubmit to ADB a project completion report, in a format acceptable to ADB, on the use and impact \nof the loan on the intended beneficiaries and the economy.  \n \nh.  Project Performance Management System \n72.  VBARD will carry out a baseline survey of a stratified sample of agro-industry SMEs that is \nrepresentative of the SME sector as a whole, within 3 months of loan effectiveness. VBARD will \nestablish and maintain the project performance management system that will include a database \nof subloans to agro-industry SMEs, and performance and recovery of subloans.  \n \ni.  Project Review \n73.  The Government, VBARD, and ADB will carry out a comprehensive midterm review of \nproject implementation at the end of year 2 to evaluate actual physical and financial progress, \nand review the relative allocations of the loan to the VBARD credit line component, compliance \nwith specific covenants, and the performance of the PIU. Using this review, modifications and \nimprovements to the Project will be made and implemented. ADB will carry out annual reviews \nthroughout the implementation of the loan. \n \nIV.

Given the limited growth prospects from further increased use of physical factors and \nbasic intermediate inputs, growth in productivity through access to and application of improved \ntechnology, information, and capital for private sector SMEs is key to maintaining growth in Viet \nNam\u2019s  agriculture  sector.  Consequently,  the  strengthening  of  agricultural  research  and \nextension  through  policy  and  institutional  reforms  is  expected  to  contribute  significantly  to \nsustaining sector growth targets over the next 10 years. Due to the exogenous macroeconomic \nand microeconomic influences on Viet Nam\u2019s agriculture sector (e.g., time required for market \nand land reforms to take full effect, and sectorwide effects of world commodity prices and \nmarkets) and the indirect impacts from institutional reforms in science and technology, future \n   \n \n ", " 21\ncontributions  to  agricultural  growth  from  the  Program  cannot  be  forecast  quantitatively. \nNevertheless,  the  future  and  critical  roles  of  access  to  and  application  of  technology  and \ninformation in productivity and quality improvements, and value addition by farmers and agro-\nindustry  enterprises  in  Viet  Nam  are  demonstrated  in  program  preparation  studies.20  The \nimpressive sector growth over the past decade was largely achieved through increased use of \nlabor,  land,  basic  intermediate  inputs  (e.g.,  fertilizer),  irrigation,  and  machinery,  with  other \ntechnology accounting for only 4% of growth. With limited options for further increasing the use \nof these inputs, future growth will depend on growth in total factor productivity, diversification, \nand quality and technology improvements. By more effectively identifying, testing, adapting, and \ndisseminating new and appropriate technologies and having them adopted by farmers and \nenterprises, the Program will significantly contribute to the Government\u2019s annual growth targets \nof 4.5% for the sector. The sector growth rate required to equate to the minimum targeted \nincremental annual recurrent expenditure on research and extension of $5.5 million is less than \n0.01% per annum (i.e., the break-even growth rate), a small fraction of the targeted 4.5% sector \ngrowth rate. Similarly, total estimated adjustment costs from institutional reforms were less than \n1.3% of the sector GDP in 2000. \n \n75.  Benefits to farmers and enterprises are likely to be realized through increased access to \nand application of improved technology. These benefits include (i) increased productivity of \nexisting areas under production; (ii) increased value through improved quality of commodities; \n(iii) lower risk and avoidance of production loss; (iv) incremental production and processing; (v) \nincreased net farm incomes and enterprise gross profits; and (vi) increased employment of rural \npeople, including the poor. These increases are attributed to (i) acquisition and development of \ntechnologies  by  the  research  institutes;  (ii)  more  effective  dissemination  to  farmers  by \nagricultural extension agents, input suppliers, and traders; and (iii) farmers\u2019 improved capacity to \nrespond to markets due to access to better market information and understanding of market \nopportunities. The full benefits of a rationalized and cost-effective research system that is more \noriented to market trends and farmer needs, and an expanded and participatory extension \nsystem are likely to be realized in the medium term. However, acquisition and transfer of \nexisting  proven  technologies  could  result  in  early  benefits.  Expanded  and  better  targeted \nservices resulting from the reforms will benefit subsistence, semicommercial, and commercial \nfarmers in irrigated, rain-fed, and mountainous areas. In addition, expanded support services, \nwhile requiring additional overall fiscal resources, will be more cost-effective due to service \nrationalization (e.g., reducing the number of research institutes), will reduce overheads and \nduplication of services and expenditure reallocation (e.g., from national research institutes to \nregional and commodity- or disciplinary-specific institutes).  \n \n76.  The provision of increased funding to research, extension, market information systems, \nand capital for value-adding agro-industry SMEs will facilitate accelerated investment in agro-\nindustry  and  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  crucial  to  their  success  in  a  competitive \nenvironment. Policy makers in Viet Nam see the rapid expansion of SMEs in the rural sector as an \neffective and largely neglected mechanism to increase employment and expand growth through \nprivate investments. The growth of rural SMEs will foster crop diversification, agroprocessing, \ngood-quality products, and exports. These SMEs share a large unmet demand for credit as \ndemonstrated in program preparation studies (footnotes 18 and 20, and the analysis of demand \nfor SME credit). The most effective conduit for providing agro-industry SME credit is VBARD with \nits current SME operations through its effective network of over 1,600 rural branch offices and \n25,000  employees.  Access  to  appropriate  medium-  and  long-term  funds  will  encourage \n                                                 \n20 Explaining Agricultural Growth in Vietnam (Que and Goletti) and Rural Industrialization and Agro-Processing in \nVietnam (Smith, Goletti, and Dung): Background papers prepared for ADB TA 3223-VIE, 2001. \n   \n \n ", "22   \nhousehold businesses in the informal sector to expand and eventually transform into registered \nenterprises,  which  would  enable  them  to  better  access  financial  resources.  Financial  and \neconomic  analyses  of  representative  agro-industry  SMEs  (including  agricultural  products \ntransport,  coffee  processing,  starch  processing,  noodle  processing,  longan  drying,  tapioca \nproduction, agricultural machinery repair, rice milling and polishing, tilling and grain transport) \nindicate good returns and viability. Financial rates of return for indicative enterprises analyzed \nranged  from  15%  (for  agriculture  machinery  repairs)  to  45%  (for  coffee  processing).  The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  ranged  from  29%  (for  rice  milling)  to  86%  (for  coffee \nprocessing). Sensitivity analysis shows that the subprojects are economically viable and are \nrobust and able to withstand changes in revenue and cost levels. A typical SME will create an \naverage of four full-time jobs. The credit line will generate about 11,750 total full-time jobs in the \nrural areas.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n77.  The Program will continue the support for market orientation in agriculture that the \nGovernment has embraced since doi moi. The Program will specifically target restructuring and \ninstitutional building in science and technology that is necessary for liberalization and market \norientation to have sustainable benefits. For the high levels of growth achieved in the past to \ncontinue into the future, a new strategy for growth in agriculture should be developed. The new \nstrategy should be based on the application of science and technology to boost productivity, \nparticularly of the poor, and vigorous promotion of private SMEs, particularly in agro-industry.  \n \n1.  Impact of Agricultural Research Restructuring \n78.  The direct impacts of the Program will be changes to the structure and operations of the \nsystem  of  research  institutes  under  MARD.  These  changes  will  be  implemented  in  an \nincremental fashion in the course of the Program. The long-term impact of changes to the \nstructure and operations of the research institutes will be to build an effective and sustainable \nagricultural research system able to contribute to the generation of sustainable technologies \nappropriate to the majority of farmers in Viet Nam.  \n \n79.  Changes in structure will involve merging some research institutes, redesignating a \nnumber  of  institutes,  closing  some,  and  refocusing  research  effort  along  regional  and \ncommodity group-based lines. These changes in structure may have impacts on the staff of the \nresearch  institutes,  who  may  be  redesignated,  relocated,  or  even  retrenched.  Changes  in \noperations  of  the  institutes  will  include  increasing  the  level  of  funding  provided  by  the \nGovernment to support research, increasing the autonomy of the research institutes, decreasing \ntheir commercial nonresearch activities, and increasing the linkages between research and \nextension. The changes in the operations of the research institutes will have an impact on the \ncapacity of the research institutes to carry out efficient and timely research relevant to the needs \nof a variety of stakeholders in agriculture. \n \n2.  Impact of Expansion of Market Information Systems \n80.  Replicating the existing pilot ICARD market information systems and analysis for farmers \nand private sector agro-industry SMEs is expected to increase farmers and SME access to \nknowledge, and ability to respond to existing and new market opportunities. This will help \nreduce the current overproduction of some basic commodities, facilitate greater focusing on \nuntapped and value-added domestic and export markets, and help farmers and enterprises \nmeet the conditions of buyers in terms of price, quality, and supply consistency.  \n   \n \n ", " 23\n \n3.  Impact of Expansion and Refocus of Agricultural Extension  \n81.  Expanding and restructuring the extension system will have a number of short- and \nmedium-term impacts on extension services at the national, provincial, district, and commune \nlevels. Training for extension staff will go beyond its current narrow focus on technical aspects \nof  production  and  will  include  postharvest  activities,  marketing,  credit,  and  environmental \nprotection and sustainability. Extension staff will be able to make an increased number of \ndemonstrations to farmers and visits to poor farmers. They will be able to reach farmers over \nwider agroecological, social, and ethnographic ranges. Participatory mechanisms for planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluating extension activities through community-based participatory extension \napproaches will enable the extension service to move from an insular, top-down approach to a \nmore integrated, group-based, and bottom-up approach. \n \n82.  Increases in the number of female and ethnic minorities extension staff will allow better \nservice to these groups in the rural areas, where traditionally they have had little interaction with \nextension services and little opportunity to develop new technologies. The long-term impact of \nexpanding and refocusing the extension service will be a better trained extension service staff \nable to share with the majority of farmers, especially the poor, improved technologies and farm \nmanagement knowledge. \n \n4.  Impact of Financial Support to Agro-industry SMEs \n83.  The major impact of financial support for agroindustry SMEs will be the establishment, \nthrough VBARD, of commercial credit lines for medium- and long-term loans. The loans will \nassist the start-up of new agro-industry SMEs and encourage the expansion of existing ones. \nThe long-term impact of financial support to agro-industry SMEs will be an expanded sector and \nimproved ability of agro-industry SMEs to compete in the domestic and international markets. In \naddition,  the  financial  position  of  VBARD  will  be  stronger,  as  the  Government  will  both \nrecapitalize and reimburse VBARD for all losses VBARD incurs on account of loans made to \nSOEs and priority sectors at the directive of the Government. VBARD\u2019s CAR will be raised and \nmaintained at a minimum of 8% of its risk assets. \n \n5.  Impact of Seed Subsidy Phaseout \n84.  Subsidies on the commercial production and sale of hybrid maize and rice seed will be \nphased out during the program period, to allow both provincial and national governments to use \nthe funds for extension and related training activities. Subsidies will no longer be required \nbecause the seed technologies are already well known by farmers and seed companies are \nproducing and selling hybrid seeds throughout the country. The research system is actively \nworking on new hybrids and private seed companies are actively involved in producing and \nmarketing hybrid seeds. This setup is expected to promote the adoption of hybrid seeds, with \nresulting increases in crop yields and productivity. Hybrid rice subsidies will continue, however, \nfor  poverty  reduction  programs  in  18  mountainous  provinces  to  help  meet  the  basic  food \nconsumption needs of poor and subsistence farmers. \n \n6.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n85.  A poverty and social impact assessment was conducted. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 7. The poor are expected to benefit in several ways by \nincreasing and reallocating expenditure on agricultural research that is more farming system \n   \n \n ", "24   \nspecific (e.g., subsistence, semicommercial, or full commercial), farmer-oriented, participatory, \ngeographically better targeted, and applicable to the needs of small and poor farmers. Research \noutputs will be more accessible, relevant, and adoptable with the effect that farm productivity \nand subsequently farm household incomes will increase. Employment for the rural unemployed \nand underemployed is expected to increase. Linkages with the rural economy in general are \nexpected to be stimulated through an increased demand for agricultural inputs and consumer \nproducts.  Wider  coverage  of  the  extension  service,  hiring  of  women  and  ethnic  minority \nextension agents, and the adoption of more participatory methods are expected to enhance the \ncoverage of poor farmers, and address the needs of female farmers and ethnic minorities in \nremote areas.  \n \n86.  Improved and expanded market information systems for agricultural products would \nincrease access to fundamental market information, empowering poor farmers through both \nbetter knowledge of prices and market opportunities when dealing with traders and buyers, and \nreduce the risks of farmers. As noted in Appendix 1, subsidies will continue on hybrid rice seeds \nfor  poverty  reduction  programs  and  for  basic  food  consumption  needs  in  remote  and \nmountainous areas. Clarifying and continuing this program will help reduce rural poverty and \nencourage farmers to adopt new hybrid technologies for sustainable crop production. For a \ngiven poor farm household, the price subsidy will be phased out progressively over a 1.5-year \nperiod,  thereby  reducing  dependence  and  ensuring  sustainability  of  rice  production  for \nsubsistence needs. The loan will improve rural credit supply and facilitate the development of \nprivate agroprocessing SMEs in rural areas.  \n \n87.  Taken together, these developments are expected to improve the competitiveness of the \nagriculture sector in domestic and international markets and contribute to a positive growth in \nthe sector rate, translating into income growth for rural producers, including the poor. Inter-\ntemporal assessment of the institutional reforms suggest short-term gains are more likely from \nthe  introduction  of  participatory  extension  services,  market  information,  and  application  of \nexisting or off-the-shelf technologies, while the full benefits from a restructured research system \nand expanded extension service are likely to occur in the medium term.  \n \n7.  Environmental Impacts \n88.  A summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) of ASDP is in Appendix 8. The \nexamination  found  that  the  policies  and  activities  proposed  in  the  ASDP  are  intended  to \ngenerate economic growth and employment in a manner that will generally reduce pressures on \nthe country\u2019s natural resource base. Consequently, ASDP will help curtail overexploitation of \nViet Nam's environment. Several proposed policy changes will promote increased efficiency of \nViet Nam's natural resource base (e.g., terminating unneeded subsidies on rice and maize \nseeds, ensuring VBARD uses market lending rates, and establishing an AMIS). Increased \nresource efficiency will ultimately lead to sustainable and protected rural areas. ASDP will also \npromote  policies  and  activities  that  increase  stakeholder  participation  in  planning  and \nimplementing agricultural development (e.g., establishing provincial extension advisory councils, \npreparing joint extension plans, and employing additional extension subject matter specialists \nand more women and ethnic minority staff). Increasing stakeholder participation is expected to \nhave a positive impact on agricultural sustainability, particularly those policies and activities that \nincrease practical and value-added extension services to female, poor, and ethnic farmers. \nRestructuring agricultural research institutes and instituting competitive research grants will \nhave  a  neutral  or  negative  impact  if  research  activities  consider  only  production  and  not \nenvironmental sustainability. For this reason, the SIEE proposes that one or more institutes \n   \n \n ", " 25\nconduct research on sustainable agriculture, and disseminate the results through the same \ninformation channels used for scientific results that originate from the research institutes.  \n \n89.  The proposed subprojects of the project loan focus on supporting value-added services \nthat do not require increases in landclearing or crop productivity. This value-added approach \nmeans the loan will generally have positive, neutral, or mitigable impacts on the environment. \nHowever, VBARD's environmental policy framework to implement the loan is modest and credit \nofficers have little training on environmental protection and sustainability. For this reason, the \nSIEE  recommends  strengthening  both  VBARD's  environmental  policy  framework  and  the \ncapacity of credit officers to consider environmental impacts during the loan application process.  \n \n90.  The environmental examination did not identify any significant negative environmental \nimpacts that cannot be mitigated. Indeed, the loans will provide greater net positive impacts \nthan the without-loans alternative. None of the policy reforms or representative projects require \na category A assessment. No further studies are required to complement the SIEE. The SIEE \nhas recommendations to maximize the positive impacts of ASDP and monitor the effectiveness \nof the mitigation measures. \n \nC.  Risks \n91.  The major risk of ASDP is possible implementation delays leading to possible delays in \nthe release of the second and third tranches. ASDP has been designed to minimize the risk of \nlack of ownership and commitment by incorporating the following measures: (i) during the \npreparation of ASDP, a highly consultative process was followed to ensure that the views of all \nthe  stakeholders  (including  the  Government,  farmers,  private  sector  representatives,  and \nNGOs) are incorporated in the final report. Four participatory workshops were held in four \nprovinces to discuss the findings of the TA; (ii) during the processing of ASDP, intensive \ndiscussions were held between ADB and the concerned Government agencies to reach an \nagreement on the policy package; and (iii) the draft development policy letter and policy matrix \nwere thoroughly reviewed with all the concerned Government agencies at each stage of loan \nprocessing.  Multiple  stakeholders\u2014government,  mass  organization,  NGO,  and  the  private \nsector\u2014will  be  involved  in  the  program  steering  committee  and  the  provincial  extension \nadvisory councils. \n \n92.  In  consultation  with  stakeholders,  the  program  design  features  fewer  but  carefully \nchosen essential measures to make implementation of ASDP easier, given the complexity and \ncommitment  needed  to  reach  agreement  and  implement  changes  through  Vietnamese \nadministration. The policy matrix now focuses on two major areas (science and technology, and \nagro-industry development), in line with the Government\u2019s priorities for the sector and ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy for Viet Nam.  \n \n93.  Furthermore,  ASDP  has  been  designed  to  reduce  delays  through  the  following \nmeasures: (i) the ADB loan will be released in three tranches, about 18 months apart; this will \ngive a longer time for dialogue between ADB and the Government, give the Government more \ntime  to  implement  the  reforms  and  promote  ownership  of  the  policies  among  the  various \nstakeholders with different interests; (ii) consulting services through an advisory TA have been \nincluded to strengthen the capacity of the Government to implement the program loan; and (iii) a \nsteering committee comprising senior staff from all the concerned ministries and agencies will \nbe established to oversee program implementation and the policy reforms. \n \n   \n \n ", "26   \nV.  ASSURANCES \n94.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government (for the program loan) and \nVBARD (for the project loan) have given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in \nthe legal documents: \n \n1.  The Program Loan \n(i)  The Government will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions taken \nprior to the date of the Loan Agreement for the program loan, as described \nin the development policy letter and the policy matrix, for the duration of the \nASDP loan and subsequently; (b) promptly adopt the other policies and \ntake the other actions included in ASDP as specified in the development \npolicy letter and the policy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies and \nactions continue in effect for the duration of the program loan period and \nsubsequently.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that annual budget allocations are made, so \nthat the counterpart funds required for project implementation are available \non time.  \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that other counterpart requirements, including \nadequate office space and support services for the PIUs, are provided \nduring program and project implementation. \n \n2.  The Project Loan \n(i)  Subprojects  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  all  applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations of the Government and with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental policies and procedures, and that subprojects will (a) have \napproved waste disposal plans, (b) not involve acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement, or (c) not use loan funds to purchase land.  \n \n(ii)  External auditors will be engaged to audit project accounts, including the \nimprest account and VBARD. The annual audited accounts and financial \nstatements, together with audit reports, in English, will be submitted within \n9 months following the end of the relevant Government fiscal year. \n \n(iii)  The modified CAR of core capital (defined as paid-up capital, retained \nearnings,  and  reserves,  excluding  reserves  for  bad  debts,  divided  by \nweighted risk assets [defined as total assets, less loan loss provisions \nand risk-free assets]) will be at least 4% by 2005. VBARD will achieve the \ntarget of a minimum CAR of 8% on total equity on or before 31 December \n2010.  \n \n(iv)  The proceeds of the credit line will not be used to finance SOEs or \nequitized enterprises where the Government has majority control. \n \n(v)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the legal documents and except as \nADB may otherwise agree, once the aggregate amount of disbursement \nto the credit line reaches 50% of the total credit line, no further subloan \n   \n \n ", " 27\nwill be approved and no disbursements will be made for new subloans \nuntil a special financial review mission of ADB will have carried out a \nfinancial review of VBARD\u2019s operations in this regard, and an agreement \nis reached between ADB, VBARD, and the Government regarding the \nrecommendations of this mission.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n95.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 44,876,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Agriculture Sector Development Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 22,438,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Agriculture Sector Development Project \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n21 November 2002 \n \n   \n \n ", "28  Appendix 1 \nSECTOR AND SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Agriculture plays a dominant role in the economy of Viet Nam, as it accounts for about \n30% of gross domestic product (GDP), 70% of employment, and 50% of export value. Although \nthese shares will decline over the coming years as they have done slowly over the past decade, \nthe agriculture sector will remain at the core of the country\u2019s economy in the next decade. \nFurther, since poverty is mainly a rural problem, attacking poverty and promoting economic \ngrowth and national development will be critical challenges for agriculture. At the same time, a \nmajor challenge is stimulating growth in investment and off-farm employment through private \nsector industries and other rural enterprises. \n \nA.  Past Performance \n \n2.  The  past  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  over  the  last  15  years  since  the \nintroduction of doi moi (economic reform) in 1986 has been impressive. Growth in agriculture \naveraged 4.3% of GDP during 1980-1990, and increased to 4.9% of GDP during 1990\u20131999. \nThis  growth  was  higher  than  that  in  India,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  and  Thailand,  and  was \ncomparable with agricultural growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The value of \nagricultural exports  rose  from  $1.1  billion  in 1990  to  $4.3  billion  in 1998.  The sources  of \nagricultural growth were large increases in yields and production of rice, maize, industrial crops, \nfruits, vegetables, livestock, and seafood. These gains were attributed to policy reforms in \nmarkets,  land  and  trade,  widespread  use  of  improved  seeds  (including  hybrid  seed)  and \nlivestock breeds, heavy application of fertilizers and pesticides, and large-scale investments in \nirrigation and road infrastructure. The Mekong River Delta and Red River Delta are the two main \nareas that experienced rapid agricultural growth and improvement in farm incomes since they \nare well served by irrigation and road infrastructure, banking services, and agricultural support \nservices. Other areas, particularly the northern uplands, the interior of the north central coast, \nand northern part of the central highlands, experienced much slower growth, and therefore \nsuffer from a high level of poverty.  \n \n1.  Crop Subsector \n \n3.  The crop subsector is the largest subsector contributing about 64% of the total output in \nagriculture,  followed  by  livestock  (18%),  fisheries  (14%),  and  forestry  (4%).1  In  the  crop \nsubsector, rice dominates agricultural output since it accounts for about 7.3 million hectares (ha) \nor 60% of agricultural land, 44% of household agricultural revenue, 75% of calorific intake, and \n30% of agricultural exports. During 1990-1998, rice production increased from 19.2 million tons \nto 29.1 million tons, an increase of about 4.3% per annum. This increase was attributed to \nincreases in both yields (2.7% per annum) and cropping intensity (2.0% per annum). The \nMekong River Delta provides about 52% of total rice production in the country and is the main \nsource of rice exports, whereas all other regions are either self-sufficient or rice-deficit areas. \nHowever, yields in the Mekong River Delta have been stagnant at about 4 tons per ha during \nthe past 5 years, suggesting that agricultural intensification in the region has caused soil fertility \nto decline. \n \n4.  Another important food crop is maize, which is widely grown in upland areas. During \n1990-1998, maize production increased by 8.9% per annum, from 0.7 million tons to 1.6 million \ntons resulting from an increase in yields (6%) and cropped area (4.8%). The average yield of \nmaize at about 3.1 tons per ha is low, considering that 63% of the total maize area is planted to \n                                                 \n1\n  The discussion in this paper will be confined to the crop subsector, given the Program\u2019s focus on it. ", "  Appendix 1  29 \nhybrid maize. This low yield suggests the presence of serious problems related to the quality of \nthe hybrid maize seeds available to farmers since good-quality hybrid maize seed can produce \nup to 6\u20138 tons per ha. The production of other food crops (cassava and sweet potato) is much \nsmaller, but plays an important role in upland agriculture.  \n \n5.  The production of industrial crops has increased rapidly in recent years in both area and \nyield. A large part of the output is destined for export. These commodities play an important role \nin  reducing  the  country\u2019s  external  trade  deficit,  crop  diversification,  providing  unique \nopportunities  to  different  regions  to  display  their  respective  potentials  and  comparative \nadvantages, increasing incomes, and improving living standards. Coffee, the second largest \nexport crop, has expanded more than 20% per year over the 1990s. During 1990-1998, coffee \nproduction tripled from 92,000 tons to 272,000 tons, as a result of increases in both area and \nyield. However, the recent sharp reduction in world coffee prices has adversely affected coffee \nproduction. Rubber (the third largest export crop) has expanded from 58,000 tons in 1990 to \n200,000 tons in 1998 at an annual growth rate of 12% per year. Cashew nuts, the fourth largest \nexport crop, has grown at more than 10% per year since 1990. Cashew nut output in 1998 was \nestimated at 386,000 tons. Black tea output, largely for export, has grown at 9% per year, while \ngreen tea production (mainly for domestic consumption) has grown slowly. Pepper is grown on \njust 12,000 ha; but because of its high value, it generates about $60 million in export revenue, \nmaking it the fifth largest export. During 1990-1998, sugarcane production increased from 5.3 \nmillion tons to 13.8 million tons. The country, however,  has no comparative advantage in \ngrowing  sugarcane.  The  large increase  in  sugarcane  production,  primarily  in  the  south,  is \nattributable  to  the  high  import  barriers  on  refined  sugar.  This  protectionist  policy  benefits \nsugarcane growers and sugar mills at the expense of consumers and food processors that use \nsugar. \n \n6.  During the last few years, the production of fruits and vegetables has also increased \nrapidly to meet the rising demand among high-income urban consumers and export markets. \nThis development is contributing to farm income, public health and well-being, and agricultural \ndiversification. Vegetable production has grown 6% per year. Citrus output has expanded three-\nfold since 1990, while the production of longan, rambutan, and litchi has grown at over 20% \nsince 1995. On the other hand, pineapple output has fallen by over 40% with the loss of the \nEastern European export markets, while banana production has stagnated. The total area under \nvegetables was estimated at 401,000 ha, while the total area under fruits reached 438,000 ha in \n1998. Although fruit and vegetable exports have increased slowly in volume (1% annually since \n1990), the export value has risen quickly (15% annually), reflecting a shift to higher-value \nproducts. The total value of fruits and vegetable exports in 2000 was estimated at $210 million. \n \n2.  Agricultural Research \n \n7.  The present system of agricultural research in Viet Nam consists of 37 institutions and \n12 agricultural universities under five ministries with overlapping functions, limited scientific \ncoordination and cooperation, and uneven geographical distribution. The Ministry of Agriculture \nand Rural Development (MARD) remains the main ministry in charge of agricultural research \nsince it supervises about 86% of the research institutes and 2 of the 12 agricultural universities. \nMost of the institutes are located in the Red River Delta and the Mekong River Delta. Many \nprovinces do not have easy access to any local research institutions. Centralization of research \nactivities and management makes it difficult for the institutes to address poverty reduction and \nenvironmental  sustainability  issues.  The  institutes  are  also  underfunded.  In  2000,  public \nexpenditure for agricultural research was D245 billion ($16 million). Given that Viet Nam\u2019s \nagricultural GDP for 2000 was estimated at D100 trillion ($7 billion), the spending of MARD on ", "30  Appendix 1 \nagricultural research in that year amounted to only 0.25% of agricultural GDP. This is low \ncompared with that in Thailand (1.40%), Malaysia (1.06%), and the PRC (0.43%). Compared \nwith D3 trillion spent on science and technology by the Ministry of Science and Technology \n(MOST) in 2000, the contribution to the agricultural research institutes represents only 5% of the \nMOST\u2019s budget. In 2002, agricultural research was allocated a budget of D297 billion ($20 \nmillion), an increase of about 20% over the 2000 allocation. But this level of funding is still low \ncompared with that for Viet Nam\u2019s neighbors and competitors.  \n \n8.  The  quality  and  qualifications  of  agricultural  researchers  are  below  international \nstandards. Of the total research staff of 7,600 in MARD, only 12% have a PhD or MSc degree, \nand the remaining 88% have either only a BSc degree or no university degree. Research \nfacilities  that  have  deteriorated  due  to  lack  of  funding  and  maintenance  also  need  to  be \nupgraded  and  modernized  to  meet  future  challenges.  The  linkage  between  research  and \nextension is weak because the research institutes are extremely centralized, on-farm research \nis not undertaken in a participatory manner with extension staff and farmers, and the links \nbetween researchers and the grassroots extension staff are poor. Many research institutes are \nmore involved in commercial production, such as the production of  certified seeds, rather than \nresearch activities. In 2000, about D22 billion or 14% of the total research budget was allocated \nfor seed production. Agricultural research must be reorganized, strengthened, and reoriented \ntoward  the  production  of  technology  packages  that  promote  agricultural  diversification  and \nintensification.  Research  on  industrial  crops,  vegetables,  fruits,  livestock,  processing \ntechnologies, and marketing is important. \n \n9.  Private sector research is very limited at present. Policies, such as tax incentives and \nless government interference, will have limited impact in promoting private research. However, \npolicies that encourage (i) privatization or equitization of research institutes managed by state-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs),  (ii)  collaboration  with  and  funding  from  both  public  sector  and \ninternational research centers, (iii) autonomy of agricultural research institutes to obtain funding \nfrom the private sector, and (iv) protection of intellectual property rights will help stimulate \nprivate involvement in research. \n \n3.  Agricultural Extension \n \n10.  The current national agricultural extension consists of central, provincial, district, and \ncommune units. At the central level, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry Extension \n(DAFE)  has  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating,  planning,  monitoring,  evaluating,  and \nbudgeting agricultural extension for the whole country. DAFE has also been given administrative \nand regulatory roles in managing national agricultural production. These roles pose a major \nconstraint to the effective functioning of DAFE as a national extension agency. The provincial \ngovernment  is  responsible  for  implementing  extension  through  its  district  and  commune \nextension networks.  \n \n11.  The  national  extension  service  suffers  from  a  scarcity  of  staff  and  limited  financial \nresources. The total number of extension staff in the country is about 8,000. Given that there \nare about 10.7 million farmers in the country, the ratio of extension staff to number of farmers is \nonly 1:1,340. About 50% of the communes do not have any extension staff. In 2002, the total \nbudget for agricultural extension was about D441 billion ($29 million) comprising D66 billion \nfrom the central government, and D375 billion from the provincial governments (largely from the \ncollection of land tax). Although this budget is D83 billion ($5.5 million) higher from the previous \nyear\u2019s budget, it is still low to meet the requirements for effective agricultural extension. Most of ", "  Appendix 1  31 \nthe budget is used to pay the salaries and wages of extension staff, leaving a very small amount \nto finance the costs of staff travel, field tours, training, and demonstration plots. \n \n12.  Agricultural extension in the country is characterized by a top-down approach in dealing \nwith farmers, insufficient knowledge and skills in effective communication and new proven \ntechnologies, weak linkages with agricultural research and universities, and ineffective use of \nmass  media  and  communications.  Making  extension  services  effective  in  promoting  the \nintensification and diversification of agriculture will require a reorientation to respond to farmers\u2019 \nneeds, rather than fulfill production targets. Private sector training of extension workers in \nparticipatory  approaches,  communication  skills,  postharvest  activities,  marketing,  and  rural \nfinance is an important part of the reorientation process. To improve the delivery of improved \nvarieties  and  technologies  to  farmers,  funding  agencies  and  international  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) have taken a number of initiatives to strengthen agricultural extension in \nthe  country.  Most  of  the  recent  efforts  have  focused  on  developing  innovative  extension \nmethodologies, given the shortage of funding and manpower in agricultural extension. Of the six \nmethodologies tested during the past 5 years, the extension club methodology is probably the \nmost attractive since the approach is simple, well understood, and low cost. MARD plans to \nadopt this approach and replicate it in different parts of the country. \n \n4.  Market Information \n13.  The Information Center for Agriculture and Rural Development (ICARD), established in \n1997, distributes on a limited basis agriculture prices and market information. The mandate of \nICARD is to (i) collect, review, and analyze the available information and make it available to \nMARD for formulating strategy and policies for the sector; (ii) review and analyze commodity \nand market information and make it available to public and private individuals and organizations \nwho may use it for decisions related to production and marketing or in formulating policies; (iii) \nreview science and technology information arising within MARD or elsewhere and make it \navailable to public and private agencies as needed; (iv) review information on international \ncooperation in the sector and make it available to interested agencies; and (v) participate in \ntrade promotion activities in agriculture. In implementing the mandate, ICARD aims to maintain \nan information stream that is kept current and is channeled to end users by all available routes. \nTo do this, ICARD has a staff of 45 (29 persons with the BS degree and 5 with postgraduate \ndegrees)  organized  into  divisions  for  library,  publications,  market  information,  and  trade \npromotion.  \n14.  ICARD  is  currently  developing  a  MARD  web  site  (www.agroviet.gov.vn)  to  give \ninformation on commodities and trade in agricultural and forestry products. The web site is \naimed at businesses and individuals who are engaged in agricultural production or trade and \nuse the information as a guide in decision making. It is of interest to both consumers and \ninvestors.  Information  on  markets,  policies,  science  and  technology,  product  quality,  and \nprograms with potential impact on agriculture and rural developments will be available at this \nsite and will be upgraded regularly. ICARD has established a continually updated database on \nagricultural policies, extension information, area devoted to various major crops and output, \nprices of 10 key export commodities, and much more. \n15.  In pilot studies financed by the Swedish International Development Agency, ICARD \ntested procedures for disseminating information to extension workers, and market retailers and \nwholesalers  at  different  levels,  and  directly  to  farmers  at  the  commune  level.  ICARD  first \nsurveyed a number of test communes and villages to determine what kind of information would ", "32  Appendix 1 \nprobably be of interest to them; it then proceeded to gather the appropriate information and \ndisseminated  it  by  bulletin  and  chalkboards  and  through  newspapers.  Dissemination  was \nfollowed by a survey of farmers to see how many had received the information. In the first \nattempt, somewhat less than half the potential recipients actually received the information. Of \nthose receiving the information on the first pass, 37% said it was useful to them. In subsequent \nsurveys of a similar type, ICARD was able to reach 80% or more of the target population, the \ngreat majority of whom reported that the information was useful. Although many of the target \ngroups found the information in a newspaper, the bulletin board route was the best. This was \ntrue for planners and other nonfarmer groups as well. \n16.  ICARD plans to expand the pilot study into a model representative of six ecological \nzones of the country. It would include locality-based information and a market for farmers \nthrough which bulletin board material could be relayed to districts and transferred to communes. \nEventually  this  should  be  developed  into  a  nationwide  system.  Increasingly  the  material \ntransmitted will include commodity quality information. In addition, ICARD will improve its rural \nstatistics database and market analysis capability with assistance from the World Bank.2 \n5.  Seed Subsidies \n \n17.  There are three types of subsidy on hybrid seeds: (i) a subsidy from the provincial \ngovernments for the commercial production of hybrid rice and maize seeds in four provinces; \n(ii) a subsidy from the national Government, implemented through DAFE, for a pilot program in \n10 provinces to encourage farmers to grow and sell hybrid rice seeds to seed companies; and \n(iii)  a  poverty  reduction  program  administered  by  the  provincial  governments  to  provide \nsubsidized hybrid rice seeds to poor and subsistence farmers in 18 mountainous provinces. The \ntotal amount spent on these subsidies in 2002 was $4.5 million equivalent: (i) $1.3 million for the \nprovincial commercial production program, (ii) $0.5 million for the national pilot program, and (iii) \n$2.7 million for the provincial poverty reduction program. \n \n18.  Viet  Nam  currently  produces  over  50%  of  its  hybrid  maize  seed  requirements \ndomestically, so there is agreement within the Government that subsidies are no longer needed \nto  promote  its  commercial  production.  The  rationale  for  the  subsidies  on  the  commercial \nproduction of hybrid rice seeds is (i) import substitution to reduce dependence on imported \nChinese rice hybrid seeds, and (ii) price stabilization to counter occasional high prices in the \nPRC. Viet Nam currently plants about 17,000 tons of hybrid rice seed yearly, but produces only \n2,500\u20133,000 tons of hybrid seed domestically. The balance is imported from the PRC, usually \nthe  male  and  female  lines  of  relatively  low-yielding  hybrids  from  private  seed  companies. \nCommercial seed companies in Viet Nam then cross these lines and the resulting hybrid seed is \nsold in domestic markets. The current price of imported hybrid rice seed is about $1,300 per ton \nand the 2002 import bill was about $22 million. The current price of hybrid seed grown in Viet \nNam is about 20% less than the import price. The Government's objective is to produce about \n50%  of  total  domestic  demand  by  2005  (about  10,000  tons).  In  addition  to  promoting \ncommercial production of hybrid rice seed, for which subsidies will end in 2003, MARD has \nbeen financing a pilot extension program whereby farmers are provided free hybrid seeds, seed \ntreatments, and training. Seed companies choose these farmers, and the national extension \nservice gives the farmer inputs and training for 2\u20133 years to grow seeds for sale to seed \ncompanies. This program is being promoted in 10 provinces where yields are highest. The \n                                                 \n2   Strengthening Capacity in Rural Statistics, for $396,000 grant assistance during 2002-2003. ", "  Appendix 1  33 \nGovernment agreed that the pilot program on hybrid rice seeds will be phased out during the \nprogram period. \n \n19.  The major rationale for promoting hybrid rice to poor and subsistence farmers is that \nhybrid rice seed outyields ordinary open-pollinated rice varieties by about 2:1 in mountainous \nareas where the poorest subsistence farmers are located. Such seeds are suitable for small \nlandholdings (the average size is 500 square meters). MARD has estimated that doubling the \ncrop yield for subsistence farmers in mountainous areas can reduce an average of 2 ha of \nslash-and-burn agriculture for every hectare of land planted to hybrid rice or maize. The rice \nsubsidy for a poor farmer is spread over three crop seasons (the average is two rice crops per \nyear) and comprises 100% of the price for the first rice crop, 50% for the second crop, 30% for \nthe third crop, and 0% for the fourth crop onward. Poor farmers are usually able to sustain rice \nproduction after the termination of the subsidy since the quantity of hybrid rice seed required is \nso small: an average of 2 kilograms of rice seed, costing about $2 (equivalent to the price of two \nchickens). This poverty reduction program is financed entirely from the provincial budgets in 16 \nnorthern provinces and 2 central provinces. \n \n6.  Rural Finance \n \n20.  Even though the three major rural financial institutions in Viet Nam, namely, the Vietnam \nBank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), the Viet Nam Bank for the Poor (VBP), \nand the People\u2019s Credit Funds (PCF), have made considerable progress in outstanding loans \ngrowth, the needs of rural households for credit are still largely unmet. The country\u2019s financial \nsystem consists of the formal, semiformal, and informal sectors. The formal sector reaches \nabout one third of rural households with a small average loan size (about $300) and a short \nrepayment period (less than 1 year). The remaining rural households obtain their credit from \nsemiformal and informal sources. Less than one half of the larger and commercial farmers are \nable to obtain credit in a given  year. Other constraints limiting the emergence of a more \ndeveloped rural finance system include the weak link between land and credit markets, interest \nrate controls, subsidized credit, favored treatment of SOEs, and prohibition on foreign banks to \nenter the land-mortgage market. \n \n21.  Even though land can be used as collateral in accessing bank credit, in practice this is \nnot yet resulting in expanded rural credit. Banks limit the collateral to the amount of land rent \nalready paid, implying that only insignificant amounts can be borrowed against the collateral. If \nthe borrower cannot repay the debt, banks find themselves in a very difficult position to auction \nthe land. This situation greatly limits the link between credit and land markets and retards the \nexpansion of rural credit. \n \n22.  Control  of  interest  rates  on  loans  and  deposits  prevents  the  financial  system  from \nfunctioning effectively. When interest rates on deposits are limited, banking institutions find it \ndifficult to mobilize savings. The liberalization of interest rates from June 2002 and the resultant \nincrease  in  VBARD  interest  rates  will  improve  VBARD\u2019s  financial  performance,  and  raise \nincome and profitability.  \n \n23.  The practice of subsidizing credit to the poor may inhibit the development of commercial \nbanking and the emergence of durable financial institutions in remote areas. Subsidized credit is \nwidely practiced by VBP, NGOs, mass organizations, and to some extent by VBARD in some of \nits programs. Experience with microfinance for the poor from Bangladesh and other countries \nsuggest that a sustainable system could be developed using market interest rates. The dramatic \nincrease in PCF\u2019s lending program is probably the best evidence for the argument that there is ", "34  Appendix 1 \nlatent demand for credit at higher interest rates and that rural financial institutions can grow \nwithout subsidized interest rates. Interest rates charged by PCF are higher than what VBARD \ncharges (1.2-1.3% for PCF versus 0.9-1.1% per month for VBARD). \n \n24.  Favored treatment for SOEs in rural credit does not bode well for expanding credit to \nrural households. Allocating credit to SOEs on the basis of directives from the central level has \ncaused serious loan recovery problems for the commercial banking system as in the case of the \nsugar industry. Moreover, giving preferential treatment to SOEs restricts access to credit of \nmillions of rural households, and small- and medium-sized enterprises. Within the central SOEs \nengaged in agriculture, about 17% incurred losses in 1998 with an average loss of D8.4 billion. \nSupport given to loss-incurring SOEs results in unfair competition between private enterprises \nand  SOEs,  and  discourages  the  private  sector  from  investing  in  areas  where  SOEs  are \ndominant. \n \nB.  Future Challenges \n \n25.  Agricultural growth in Viet Nam over the past 15 years was the result of a combination of \n(i) institutional factors such as new incentive to farmers recognized by doi moi as autonomous \neconomic agents; (ii) physical factors such as land, labor, and capital (mostly in the form of \nirrigation system); and (iii) intermediate inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. The role of \nscience and technology in explaining growth over the past 15 years has been relatively small, \nsince most of the growth could be explained by increasing factors of production. This strategy is \nunlikely to sustain similar growth in the future for three reasons: (i) the labor force in agriculture \nis starting to decline and with very little land available per farmer, the attractiveness of farming \nwill decline further; (ii) new investment in irrigation exhibits decreasing marginal returns as the \nstock of irrigation capital is already very high and requires increased repair and maintenance \nrather than new expansion, (iii) Viet Nam has already captured a large share of world rice \nmarkets so that both domestic and international demand for rice will start to grow at a much \nlower rate than in the past.  \n \n26.  Future sustained growth in agriculture will have to come from an increasing demand \n(both in the country and internationally) for high-value agricultural products. That implies a more \ndiversified agricultural system, where a variety of high-quality products are produced for the \nmarket. This will also imply a change from a perspective that is focused on production volume to \nincreasing production values. Future agricultural growth will also require a policy environment \nthat promotes competition and uses science and technology applied to agricultural production to \nmeet the demand of a more sophisticated market. Policy reforms are required to address the \nweaknesses in agricultural research, agricultural extension, and rural finance. Competition will \nbe necessary to lower production cost and thus capture higher market shares and profits in the \ninternational markets. Science and technology will be necessary to identify new production \nprocesses and innovative products that can increase productivity in the agricultural system to a \nmuch  larger  extent  than  addition  of  labor,  irrigated  land,  and  fertilizers.  Developing  agro-\nindustry, promoting private small- and medium-sized agro-industry enterprises, and supporting \nmarket infrastructure and institutions will be necessary to capture higher value-added from \nagricultural production. If all these requirements can be fulfilled, Viet Nam will be able to achieve \na broad-based, market-oriented, and sustainable growth in agriculture in the next decade. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  35 \nCHRONOLOGY \n \n1.  In response to a request from the Government of Viet Nam, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) provided a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the design of the Program.1 \nThe TA (i) assessed the impact of previous policy changes in the sector;2 (ii) assisted the \nGovernment and ADB develop strategies for the agriculture and rural development sector to \n2010, including a time-bound action plan; and (iii) prepared policy reform proposals for the \nAgriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP). Under the TA, six surveys were conducted of \n(i) 410 private agro-industries nationwide, (ii) 400 commercial farmers nationwide, (iii) 210 poor \nhouseholds in a socioeconomic survey in three regions, (iv) institutional constraints in the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), (v) contributions to agricultural growth, \nand (vi) fertilizer marketing in the Red River Delta. A highly consultative process was followed in \npreparing  ASDP.  Five  participatory  workshops  were  held  in  four  provinces  to  discuss  the \nfindings of the TA. A national workshop with about 130 participants was held in MARD on \n5 December 2000. In addition, two workshops were held to discuss the results of the agro-industry \nsurvey and another two were held to discuss the socioeconomic and productivity surveys. The \nconsultant team leader presented the major findings and recommendations in Manila and Hanoi \nin March and April 2001.  \n \n2.  ADB was instrumental in assisting the Government develop a new 10-year (2001\u20132010) \nagriculture and rural development strategy during the preparation of this sector development \nprogram. The Government approved this strategy in mid-2001. The proposed ASDP has been \ndesigned to help the Government implement this strategy.  \n \n3.  A Loan Fact-Finding Mission3 visited Viet Nam from 25 February to 17 March 2002 and \na Follow-Up Mission during 8\u201315 April 2002. An Appraisal Mission4  visited  Viet Nam during \n17\u201330 June 2002 and a Follow-Up Mission during 2\u20133 October 2002 to reach an understanding \nwith  the  Government  on  the  policy  reforms.  The  Missions  held  detailed  discussions  with \ngovernment and other aid agencies, private sector agribusinesses and small- and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  farmers.  Field  trips  were \nconducted  to  Bac  Ninh,  Quang  Ninh,  and  Vinh  Phuc  provinces  to  investigate  the  lending \noperations of the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development to SMEs. Field trips \nwere also conducted in Vinh Phuc and Phu Tho provinces in the northern region and Binh \nDuong,  Long  An,  and  An  Giang  provinces  in  the  southern  region  to  meet  with  provincial \ngovernment  representatives,  and  research  institutes  and  universities.  The  Missions  also \nparticipated in two workshops in Hanoi during 25-27 February 2002: (i) a national agricultural \nextension workshop conducted by MARD and several international NGOs active in promoting \nparticipatory  extension  methods,  and  (ii)  a  joint  World  Bank-International  Rice  Research \nInstitute workshop to present the World Bank\u2019s new global rural development strategy. \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2002.

Poverty Analysis \n \n\u2022  Poverty is widespread in the country, especially in the rural areas. \n\u2022  According to the Living Standards Measurement Survey (using the international poverty line) Viet Nam\u2019s poverty \nincidence was about 37% in 2000 and 85% of the poor reside in rural areas. Most poor households depend on \nsubsistence production. \n\u2022  Low agricultural productivity and lack of access and competitiveness in markets result in low income in rural \nareas, which is one of the main explanatory factors for poverty in Viet Nam. \n\u2022  The poor have relatively low levels of educational attainment and lack functional skills and information on \nmarkets, thereby reducing opportunities for sales in higher value and more diverse markets.  \n\u2022  The poor have limited access to assets such as land and credit. The poor are vulnerable to social isolation. They \nare vulnerable to household-specific shocks, community-wide crises, natural calamities, and food insecurity.  \n\u2022  Around 40% of poor households, especially the poorest of the poor households in the rural area, are unable to \naccess any source of credit. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis prepared  Participation Strategy \nYES  YES \n(cid:131)  The Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) will involve the participation of many stakeholders at \ndifferent levels and from different sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the \nprovincial governments will be actively involved. At the regional and local level, research institutes of MARD and \nextension services will play very active roles. The Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \n(VBARD) will also be an important stakeholder. Private agriculture input suppliers and cooperatives will \nparticipate in implementing the program. Nongovernment organizations, both domestic and international, will \nalso be involved in ASDP. The participation of the key social organizations like the Vietnam Women's Union and \nfarmers\u2019 associations is essential. At provincial levels, local authorities will participate by establishing and \nstrengthening agriculture extension councils. Enhanced outreach at the commune level will be achieved by \nadding extension agents and introducing participatory extension methods. \n\u2022  ASDP will observe an integrated participatory approach in the implementation process. The involvement of \nstakeholders from different levels and from different sectors, including the target beneficiaries, will ensure that \nthis approach is carried out. One important feature is the participation of the local people, i.e. farmers and the \npoor, in the process of planning, implementing, and monitoring. It is intended that the participation of the local \npeople in agricultural research and extension will be institutionalized.  \n\u2022  Under the project loan, the participation of agro-industry small- and medium-sized enterprises is also ensured by \nthe cofinancing rate of 20% in the subproject cost.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed loans were screened for environmental impacts using matrices based on \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and \nNatural Resource Development Projects, 1991. Impact significance was determined using an \napproach based on ADB\u2019s Environmental Impact Assessment for Developing Countries in Asia, \n1997. \n \nB.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Program Loan \n \n2.  The program loan was screened for (i) the proposed sector policy actions, (ii) anticipated \nenvironmental impact, and (iii) the recommended environmental action to be taken. In general, \nthe screening found the impacts of proposed reforms to be significant positive, unknown, or \nnone. The screening did not find any significant negative environmental impacts due to the \nproposed policy reforms. \n \n3.  Significant positive impacts exist because the policy reforms have two characteristics \nthat  support  sustainability:  elimination  of  market  distortions  and  participatory  planning. \nEconomic policies that help eliminate market distortions generally stimulate growth and improve \nthe environment. In many countries the reduction of subsidies on agricultural inputs has led to \nmore efficient use of these resources and reduced surface water and groundwater pollution, \nimproved air quality, and decreased the accumulation of toxic wastes. Moreover, non-distorting \neconomic policies that stimulate economic growth by improving the allocation of resources \ngenerally create appropriate incentives for the protection of the environment. The program loan \nalso proposes numerous interventions that will increase the participation of farmers (particularly \nethnic groups, female, and people working in marginal farming conditions) in planning and \ndecision  making.  Proposed  policies  also  support  more  on-farm  research  and  increased \nextension services. These types of activities weave local knowledge into the planning process\u2014\na critical trait for environmentally sustainable and socially relevant agricultural development. \n \n4.  Several policy reforms have unknown impact. In these cases,1 it is not clear how the \nproposed policy reforms will specifically address environmental protection of natural ecosystems \nor environmental sustainability of existing agricultural areas.  \n \n2.  Project Loan \n \n5.  Following ADB requirements,2 environmental concerns of the project loan were reviewed \nat two levels: (i) the national lending policy of the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment (VBARD); and (ii) the expected impacts of representative subprojects supported \nby the loan.  \n \n                                                 \n1  For example, restructuring the research institutes, designing and awarding research grants, increasing on-farm \nresearch, developing subject matter specialists, creating a human resource development plan. \n2  See paras. 10, 11, and 12 of ADB. 1998. Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development \nBank. Manila. ", " 58 Appendix 8   \n6.  The lending policy review found that VBARD\u2019s agency-wide regulation for lending to \ncustomers  does  not  identify  specific  provisions  for  environmental  protection.3  However, \nVBARD\u2019s guidelines for appraising loan applications clearly state that all loan applications must \nadhere  to  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MOST).4 \nFurthermore, VBARD staff stated in meetings and written communications that VBARD has no \nseparate policy on the environment. To compensate for these policy deficiencies, ADB has \nfound it beneficial in the past to develop loan-specific guidelines and procedures for borrowers \nof VBARD funds. The most relevant VBARD example is the ADB-financed Rural Credit Project \nwhere environmental guidelines were produced and applied to rural credit loan borrowers.5 The \nguidelines  state  that  (i)  subprojects  need  to  meet  Viet  Nam\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \nregulations (footnote 4); (ii) loans cannot be used to purchase or use a specific list of banned \npesticides; and (iii) subprojects cannot have any negative impact on erosion, deforestation, the \nlocal community, noise, dust, etc. A second example is the State Bank of Vietnam\u2019s (SBV) \nEnvironmental Assessment of Rural Credit Loans in Viet Nam: Field Guidelines (January 2000). \nThese guidelines are for the use of credit officers assessing the environmental and health risks \nposed by rural credit loans. The guidelines cover subprojects in land clearing, fertilizer use, \npesticide  use,  livestock,  poultry,  artisanal  fishing,  aquaculture,  food  processing,  leather \nproduction, brick manufacturing, ceramics, and an appendix containing a one-page environment \nform for credit officers and borrowers to fill-out. However, it was found that VBARD credit \nofficers seldom use the guidelines.  \n \n7.  While  VBARD\u2019s  policy  framework  for  environmental  protection  is  modest,  VBARD \nnevertheless operates under an internal set of environmental assessment procedures. For large \nprojects that have significant environment impacts, VBARD requires the project owners to hire \nrelated  authority  agencies  to  evaluate  their  project\u2019s  environment  impacts  and  submit \nenvironmental impacts assessment to VBARD for consideration. For medium-sized projects, \nVBARD\u2019s credit officers assessed the environment impacts during the project appraisal process \n(e.g., waste treatment measures, environmental pollution, measures to minimize environmental \nimpacts, and measures to improve environment impacts in accordance to recommendations of \nthe related authority agencies). According to VBARD, the credit officers primarily use their \npractical work experience to conduct environmental appraisal duties. VBARD states it has not \norganized any training course specifically on environment issues for these credit officers, with \nthe  exception  of  some  training  courses  organized  by  the  International  Credit  Project \nManagement Unit of SBV under the Rural Credit Project. \n \n8.  The expected impacts of representative subprojects supported by the Project were also \nreviewed. The screening began by merging representative subprojects into three categories: \n(i) transport subprojects, (ii) food processing subprojects, and (iii) light industrial subprojects. \nMost projects funded under the loan are expected to fall into one of these three categories. The \nscreening considered a wide range of situations and therefore a wide range of impacts for each \nsubproject category. For example, the location of a food processing plant in the forested area of \nthe central highlands may have a mitigable impact, but a food processing plant located in a rural \nindustrial zone of the Mekong delta may have no ecological impacts. In these cases, the \nprecautionary principle was applied by ascribing a mitigable evaluation to the potential impact of \nall food processing locations. The screening found all subproject activities for all categories to \nhave either not significant or mitigable impacts. If the mitigation measures are achieved, it is \n                                                 \n3  Decision No. 72/QD-HDQT-TD: The Regulations to Lending to Customers of VBARD\u2019s System (2002). \n4  These include Law on Environmental Protection (1993); CP 175 Providing Guidance on the Implementation on the \nLaw on Environmental Protection (1994); and CP 490 Circular letter of Guidance on Setting up and Appraising the \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Report for Investment Projects (1998). \n5  No. 1135 (July 08/97): Environmental Advice for Loan Applicants of the ADB Rural Credit Loan (pp. 52-56). ", "  Appendix 8  59\nlikely the loan will have a significant positive impact by increasing resource efficiency, reducing \npoverty, and promoting social equity while concurrently promoting environmental sustainability. \n \nC.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n9.  The loan has an environmental management plan with two parts: (i) mitigation measures \nto minimize potential negative impacts and/or maximize potential positive impacts, and (ii) a \nmonitoring framework to assess the efficiency of mitigation measures. \n \n10.  Two mitigating actions are proposed for the policy reform loan. The first is promoting \nsustainable agricultural development as a research priority of the Ministry of Agriculture and \nRural Development (MARD). This mitigation does not require new research institutes to be \ncreated\u2014it  only  requires  MARD  to  assign  to  one  or  more  existing  institutes  the  specific \nresponsibility of designing and implementing research activities on agricultural practices that \nuse natural resources and systems, in a way that environmental quality can be maintained for \ncurrent and future generations. MARD should weave the knowledge acquired through this \nresearch into numerous practical activities. For example,  MARD can ensure that research \ngrants are evaluated in part by sustainability criteria and/or provide 2-3 grants per year that \nfocus  specifically  on  sustainable  agriculture.  This  can  be  achieved  by  adding  \u201csustainable \nquestions\u201d to the application process. For example, research applications could ask: \u201chow will \nthe  knowledge  acquired  from  this  research  protect  Viet  Nam\u2019s  natural  environment?\u201d  (the \nanswer might be \u201cto reduce deforestation rates\u201d); or \u201chow will the knowledge acquired from this \nresearch maintain or improve the quality of arable land in Viet Nam for future generations?\u201d (the \nanswer  might  be  \u201cto  reduce  salinity  intrusion  for  arable  land  in  Mekong  delta,  therefore \nmaintaining  total  hectares  of  arable  land\u201d).  MARD  can  also  ensure  that  on-farm  research \nactivities test new ideas and approaches for sustainable agriculture proposed by research \ninstitutes,  and  ensure  that  the  human  resource  development  plan  specifically  address \nsustainable agriculture as a development goal. \n \n11.  The second proposed mitigating action for the program loan is ensuring that extension \nservices provide adequate knowledge relating to sustainable agriculture. To implement this \nmeasure, MARD should ensure that (i) the joint extension plan specifically states that staff will \nreceive  training  on  practical  tools  and  approaches  for  agricultural  sustainability  and \nenvironmental protection; (ii) the terms of reference for contracted extension service providers \nshould  include  a  requirement  to  disseminate  information  on  environmental  protection  and \nagricultural sustainability; and (iii) MARD could consider incorporating environmental risks (e.g., \nrisks of biodiversity loss, increased air/water pollution, and soil contamination/erosion) into the \nrisk analysis component of its proposed market information system. \n \n12.  One mitigation measure proposed for the project loan: to ensure that subprojects are \ndesigned  and  implemented  in  a  manner  that  promotes  sustainability  and  environmental \nprotection. Actions to implement this mitigation measure follow: (i) VBARD will develop and \nsubmit to ADB an environmental and social management system (policy, procedure, resources) \nfor its operations;6 (ii) if additional capacity is required to implement the system, VBARD should \ndesign  and  submit  a  capacity  development  plan  to  ADB;  and  (iii)  VBARD  will  submit  an \nenvironmental performance report on its environmental and social management system. \n                                                 \n6 This system should be practical  and therefore  build  on existing  procedures that support sustainability and \nenvironmental protection (e.g., adopt relevant sections of (i) State Bank of Vietnam\u2019s Environmental Assessment of \nRural Credit Loans in Viet Nam: Field Guidelines (January 2000); and (ii) VBARD\u2019s No. 1135 (July 08/97); \nEnvironmental Advice for loan applicants of the ADB Rural Credit Loan (pp. 52-56). In addition to existing policies \nand procedures, VBARD should consider the potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures presented. ", " 60 Appendix 8   \n \n13.  The implementation and effectiveness of mitigation measures described above need to \nbe monitored in a systematic and transparent way. The monitoring programs should include \nclear  monitoring  objectives,  indicators  to  monitor,  monitoring  locations,  and  frequency  of \nmonitoring. The results should be included in the loan\u2019s regular reporting. \n \nD.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n14.  The loan supports many policy reforms and activities that have the potential to promote \nsocial and environmental sustainability as it relates to agricultural development in Viet Nam.7 \nMaking  sustainability  an  explicit  part  of  the  long-term  goal  will  clarify  the  purpose  for \nincorporating the below recommendations in the Program. \n \n15.  The program loan should have a net positive effect on the environment. However, there \nare many policy reforms with unknown impact. There is ample opportunity to increase the \npositive environmental impact of this loan by transforming unknown impacts into significant \npositive  impacts.  Adherence  to  the  following  recommendations  can  achieve  that.  The \ncombination of letters and numbers refers to items in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). \n(i)  A1.1, A1.6, and A1.12: Restructuring of research institutes should result in at \nleast one institute having sustainable agriculture as a primary research priority. \nThe results of this research will be MARD\u2019s knowledge base on environmental \nand social impacts for new and existing agriculture activities for present and \nfuture generations. The knowledge base can be communicated to other institutes \nas a set of guidelines, sustainability indicators, etc. Research results can then \nbecome information inputs into performance-based evaluation, on-farm research, \nand development of competitive grants (A1.3, A1.8). \n(ii)  A1.1: Conduct on-farm research on issues relating to sustainable agriculture. \nThese issues can be selected and coordinated with activities of the institute(s) \nconducting sustainable agriculture research. \n(iii)  A.1.3  and  A1.8:  Ensure  research  grants  are  evaluated  in  part  by  a  set  of \nsustainability  criteria.  These  criteria  should  be  based  on  findings  of  the \nsustainable agriculture research program and the priorities of MARD and MOST \n(A1.1). \n(iv)  A1.5, A1.11, and A1.15: Ensure the MARD policy on proportional increases to \nresearch budgets explicitly states \u201cresearch on sustainable agriculture.\u201d \n(v)  A1.8:  Of  10  annual  research  grants,  2-3  grants  should  be  earmarked  for \nresearch on environmental protection or environmental sustainability. \n(vi)  A1.9. The human resource development plan should include specific objectives \nand activities relating to developing skills in sustainable agriculture. \n(vii)  A2.1: Operational guidelines for provincial extension advisory councils need to \ninclude  stakeholders  that  typically  have  an  interest  in  social  equity  and \nenvironmental  protection  (e.g.,  Departments  of  Science  and  Technology, \nwomen\u2019s unions, and nongovernment organizations). \n                                                 \n7 Sustainable agriculture is used here to mean agricultural practices that use natural resources and systems in a way \nthat environmental quality can be maintained for current and future generations. ", "  Appendix 8  61\n(viii)  A2.2:  Some  extension  service  providers  should  disseminate  information  on \nenvironmental protection and agricultural sustainability. \n(ix)  A2.5: The extension plan should be designed to ensure that extension staff \nreceive training on practical tools and approaches for agricultural sustainability \nand environmental protection. Relevant results from research institutes (A1.1) \nshould be woven into the plan. \n(x)  A2.8: Ensure subject matter specialists listed in the regulation or circular include \nthose with expertise in environmental sustainability and protection. \n(xi)  B1.1, B1.5, and B1.7: Plan for agricultural market information system should \ninclude information on environmental risks. These risks should be based on \nexperiences of sustainable agriculture research institutes, on-farm research, and \na priori knowledge. \n16.  The project loan has the potential to create a significant positive impact by increasing \nresource efficiency, reducing poverty, and promoting social equity while concurrently promoting \nenvironmental sustainability. However, to realize this potential, it is recommended that VBARD \nand ADB produce a set of specific lending and appraisal guidelines similar to those developed \nfor the Rural Credit Project. These guidelines should be designed through cooperative dialogue \nwith VBARD, field visits to potential project sites, and review of potential impacts and mitigation \nmeasures identified. A competent authority should monitor the progress of implementing the \nmitigating  and  monitoring  measures  as  part  of  the  regular  monitoring  program.  If  the \nrecommendations are implemented successfully, the overall loan will have a greater net positive \nenvironmental benefit than the without-loan scenario. \nE.  Conclusions \n17.  Viet Nam\u2019s agricultural system provides national food security, generation of surplus for \nindustrialization,  and  competitiveness  of  the  economy  in  world  markets.  With  further \nintensification of the farming systems being required to meet future food and fiber needs, natural \nresources will be further stressed and sustainability issues will become more critical. In light of \nthese demands, ADB is proposing an Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP). The \nProgram  will  (i)  focus  on  a  series  of  policy  reforms  to  streamline  the  management  and \ncompetitiveness of agricultural research institutes, increase extension activities to rural farmers, \nand increase local participation in planning and decision making; and (ii) support VBARD in \nproviding loans for value-added and non-primary production activities (e.g., transport, food \nprocessing, and light industry) to small- and medium-sized enterprises. \n18.  The environmental screening of the program loan yielded a mix of significant positive \nimpacts,  unknown  impacts,  or  no  impacts.  Recommendations  to  maximize  the  positive \nenvironmental benefits of the policy loan are proposed in the initial environmental examination \n(IEE). The screening did not reveal any significant negative environmental impacts due to the \nproposed policy reforms. \n19.  The environmental screening of the project loan found a mix of no impacts, mitigable \nimpacts,  or  insignificant  impacts.  Recommendations  to  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  are \nproposed in the IEE. If these mitigation measures are implemented, the loan has the potential to \ncreate a significant positive impact by increasing resource efficiency, reducing poverty, and \npromoting social equity while concurrently promoting environmental sustainability.  ", " 62 Appendix 8   \n20.  Taking to account the entire loan package, the environmental impact screening identified \nno significant negative environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated. Indeed, ASDP will \nprovide greater net positive impacts than the without-loan alternative. None of the policy reforms \nor representative projects are in category A. No further studies are required to complement the \nIEE.  Recommendations  to  maximize  the  positive  impacts  of  ASDP  and  monitor  the \neffectiveness of the mitigation measures are provided in the summary IEE.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021129112928", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20021217164159+08'00'"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2002) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  dong (D) \n \nD1,000 =  $0.0651   \n$1.00 =  D15,365   \n \nFor the purpose of calculations in this report, the rate of $1.00 = D15,000 was used. \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  AMIS  \u2013  agricultural market information system \n  ASDP  \u2013  Agriculture Sector Development Program \n  CAR  \u2013  capital adequacy ratio \n  DAFE  \u2013  Department of Agriculture and Forestry Extension \n  Danida  \u2013  Danish International Development Agency \n  FAO  \u2013  Food and Agriculture Organization \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  GTZ  \u2013  Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency \nfor Technical Cooperation) \n  ICARD  \u2013  Information Center for Agriculture and Rural Development \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  MARD  \u2013  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \n  MOST  \u2013  Ministry of Science and Technology \n  MPI  \u2013  Ministry of Planning and Investment \n  NEC  \u2013  National Extension Center \n  NGO  \u2013  nongovernment organization \n  PCF  \u2013  People\u2019s Credit Fund \n  PIU  \u2013  program/project implementation unit \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  SBV  \u2013  State Bank of Vietnam \n  Sida  \u2013  Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency \n  SIEE  \u2013  summary initial environmental examination \n  SME  \u2013  small- and medium-sized enterprise \n  SOE  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  VBARD  \u2013  Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \n  VBP  \u2013  Vietnam Bank for the Poor \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of R.
