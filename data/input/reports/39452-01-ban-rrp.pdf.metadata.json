The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting \nGovernance Management Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nThe project seeks to improve transparency and accountability of public service delivery \n2. \nin  tax  and  land  record  administrations  in  Bangladesh  with  the  help  of  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT).  The  three  outputs  of  the  project  are  (i)  online  filing  of  tax \nreturns,  (ii)  digitized  land  records  management  system  in  selected  districts,  and  (iii)  improved \naccess to tax and land information in specialized information and service centers.1 \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nDespite  persistent  poverty, 2 Bangladesh  is  on  track  to  achieve  the  2015  Millennium \n3. \nDevelopment  Goal  target  of  reducing  income  poverty  by  half,  has  made  progress  in  other \nindicators of well-being (such as for infant and child mortality), and has met the target for gender \nparity in primary and secondary schooling. While some progress has been made in alleviating \npoverty  (e.g.,  during  2000\u20132005,  income  poverty  was  reduced  from  48.9%  to  40%,  or  by  1.8 \npercentage points annually), income inequalities widened, especially in the 1990s, and poverty \nreduction has been uneven across regions (with the urban areas not seeing great reduction in \npoverty).  It  does  not  help  that  the  country  has  a  rather  limited  resource  base,  especially  from \ndirect  taxes,  from  which  to  augment  public  investment  in  economic  and  social  infrastructure. \nThe income tax to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio in Bangladesh is hovering around 2%, as \nagainst 4% in Pakistan and more than 6% in India. \n \n4. \nCompounding  this  problem  is  the  lack  of  good  governance  in  the  country.  For  five \nconsecutive  years  from  2001  to  2005,  Bangladesh  was  placed  at  the  bottom  of  the  list  in \nTransparency International's corruption perceptions index.3 Other universal indices (such as the \nGlobal  Integrity  Report,  Doing  Business  Survey)  and  national  surveys  (such  as  the  state  of \ngovernance) also consistently show that there is still much progress to be made in governance \nreforms,  and  in  ensuring  that  the  average  citizen  perceives  that  the  state  provides  effective, \ntransparent, and accountable public services.  \n \n5. \nIt  is  now  universally  recognized  that  good  governance  can  help  a  country  to  improve \nallocative  efficiency  of  limited  resources. While  macro  policy-based  reforms  are  necessary \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance to help prepare a follow up \nprogram  to  the  Good  Governance  Program.

Manila. \n\n2  Bangladesh  is  a  country  that  is  primarily  dependent  on  agriculture  and  has  a  narrow  base  of  exports.  Although \nagriculture and allied activities contribute 21% of gross domestic product (GDP), 48% of the labor force depends \non  agriculture.  Given  the  rather  poor  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  historically,  this  has  contributed  to \npersistent poverty, with an estimated 56 million in poverty in 2005. \n3  Transparency International. 2005. Corruption Perceptions Index. Berlin. \n\n\f 2 \n\nconditions for good governance,4 the conditions need to be commensurate with the changes in \nthe  delivery  mechanism,  supported  by  state-of-the-art  technologies.  ICT  applications  have  the \npotential  to  trigger  and  shape  significant  changes  in  the  delivery  of  public  services  and  in  the \nway  governments  function.  The  ruling  party's  own  election  manifesto  and  the  Government's \nDigital  Bangladesh  strategy  acknowledge  this.  In  this  regard,  as  in  many  other  developing \ncountries,  the  Government  has  promoted  e-governance  applications  in  recent  years  to  foster \ngrowth and development and to enhance the quality of service delivery.  \n \nThe project is consistent with the country partnership strategy 5and is in conformity with \n6. \nthe recommendations made in the 2009 country assistance program evaluation in Bangladesh, \nwhich  found  that  lack  of  good  governance  in  many  areas  is  one  of  the  country's  binding \nconstraints  on  growth,  and  recommended  support  for  further  governance  reforms.6 The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country operations business plan for 2010\u20132012 for Bangladesh7 \nstates that ADB will continue to provide assistance in improving governance in Bangladesh by \nenhancing governance management capacity. Recognizing the need for the application of ICT \ntools for improved governance, the Supporting Governance Management Project identifies three \nkey  areas  where  the  application  of  ICT  tools  has  the  potential  to  enhance  efficiency, \ntransparency, and accountability in public service delivery: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nTax  administration  is  one  of  the  most  promising  areas  where  good  governance \ncan lead to significant gains in terms of increasing tax revenues and in enhancing \ntransparency in tax filing. Indeed, a country's tax policy is in many ways only as \ngood  as  the  supporting  tax  administration.8 It  is  widely  accepted  that  filing  tax \nreturns  online  can  significantly  improve  tax  compliance  and  revenue  buoyancy. \nElectronic  tax  filing  is  one  example  of  how  automation  can  assist  in  facilitating \nprocessing of tax files.9 Another benefit of electronic tax filing is the elimination of \nthe  interface  between  the  taxpayer  and  tax  officer,  thereby  reducing  the \nincidence of corruption and other alleged fraudulent practices. \n\nProper  land  records  management  is  another  area  where  the  application  of  ICT \ntools  can  greatly  enhance  the  quality  of  public  service  delivery.  Digitization  of \nland  records  is  one  of  the  important  prerequisites  for  improvements  in  land-\nrelated  services  and good  administration that  also  aim to  reduce  harassment  of \nthe  average  landowner  and  small  business  owner  in  registering  property.  In  an \nagriculture-dependent  economy  where  marginalized \nlandholding  by  small \nfarmers is a defining characteristic, maintaining land records is a precondition not \nonly  for  land  reform  policies  to  be  successfully  implemented  but  also  for  social \n\n                                                 \n4  Steps  taken  by  the  previous  caretaker  government  and  the  present  one  as  part  of  the  support  rendered  by  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) under the Good Governance Program have provided a broad measure of policy \ncoverage  to  such  good-governance  reforms.  Two  of  the  most  critical  reforms  are  the  separation  of  the  judiciary \nfrom the executive, and promulgation of the Right to Information Act. ADB. 2007.

The non-oil and gas revenue to GDP ratio increased from 9.9% in 2002 to 11.6% \nin 2005 without many changes in tax policies. The result was particularly striking in the case of value-added tax. \nSome  of  the  important  reforms  include  (i)  setting  up  a  unit  for  large  taxpayers,  (ii)  improving  tax  audit,  and  (iii) \nimproving human resource management.

Washington, DC.)  \n\n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\njustice. Moreover, Bangladesh is one of the most crowded countries in the world \nand  competition  for  land  is  fierce.  As  such,  and  because  of  forged  ownership \nrecords,  disputes  over  land  ownership  are  the  biggest  single  cause  of  court \ncases in Bangladesh. It has been reported that land disputes can take anywhere \nfrom 3 years to 45 years to be resolved.10 It has also been reported that almost \n80% of legal battles (criminal cases) in Bangladesh are about land (the number is \nexpected to be even higher in civil cases). Given that court cases (both civil and \ncriminal)  can  be  a  major  source  of  harassment  to  the  poor,  it  makes  business \nsense to try to alleviate the primary cause of the case, i.e., inaccurate records of \nland holdings. The use of ICT in land records management enables accelerated \nstorage,  processing,  and  retrieval  of  information  in  land  records.  Digitization  of \nland records can also help to generate revenue, since proper land records help \nthe government to raise significantly higher revenue from land. \n\nThe  success  of  any  good  governance  initiative\u2014based  on  the  principle  of  a \nparticipatory  approach\u2014critically  depends  on  equal  access  to  information,  and \nbidirectional information flows. Good governance principles alone cannot help to \nalleviate poverty without equal and easy access to all relevant information for the \ncitizenry.11 Weak  and  inadequate  information  infrastructure  systems,  as  well  as \nlimited financial resources to develop or strengthen them, could easily derail the \ngood  governance  initiatives.  The  advent  of  ICT  tools  through  the  designated \ninformation  centers  makes  equal  access  to  information  possible  even  in  the \nremote  villages,  provided  these  centers  are  effectively  designed  and  properly \nmanaged.  Thus,  the  information  centers  could  benefit  the  communities  and  the \ngovernment in many ways, including by: (a) saving on costs of compliance with \ngovernment  rules  and  procedures,  (b)  reducing  harassment  by  middlemen,  (c) \nproviding  additional  information  to  make  the  good  governance  initiatives \nsuccessful, and (d) helping the government to accomplish the desired outcomes \nof  the  proposed  good  governance  initiatives.  However,  considerable  efforts  are \nneeded  to  address  the  information  constraints  and  difficulties  with  financial  and \ntechnical  support.12 Research  has  shown  that  the  benefit  on  investment  from  a \ntelecenter can be high. Thus, supporting the government's endeavor to promote \ninformation sharing is important to achieving the overall impact of the project.13 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10 See,  e.g.,  Shahjahan  Siraj.  2009.

In  2004,  economics  professor  Abul  Barkat  of  Dhaka \nUniversity calculated that, at the current rate of progress in dispensing with court cases, it would take \u201c30 million \nyears for all the cases to be resolved\" (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3533817.stm).  \n\nand  Corruption \n\nblamed \n\npoor, \n\nland \n\nfor \n\n11  Nora  Quebral  of  the  University  of  the  Philippines  first  emphasized  the  importance  of  communication  and \ninformation  in  the  participatory  development  process,  and  used  the  term  \u201cdevelopment  communication\u201d  (N.C. \nQuebral.  1971.  Development  communication  in  the  agricultural  context.  Paper  presented  at  the  symposium  In \nSearch  of  Breakthroughs  in  Agricultural  Development,  College  of  Agriculture,  University  of  the  Philippines, \nLaguna). \n\n12  This is especially true because Bangladesh ranks very poorly in terms of internet penetration when compared with \nother Asian countries (http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats3.htm#asia). Internet penetration is just 0.4% of the \npopulation, as against the Asian average of 20.1%. \n\n13  There are many examples of ICT applications for improved service delivery: (i) Lokavani in the Sitapur district of \nIndia; (ii) People First Network (PFNet) in Solomon Islands; (iii) Akshaya, Bhoomi, e-Seva, and Janmitra in India; \nand  (iv)  Sarvadaya  Program  in  Sri  Lanka  (http://www.apdip.net/apdipenote/11.pdf  for  details).  See  also  World \nBank. 2003. World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People. Washington, D.C.: Oxford \nUniversity Press. \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nOverarching  the  support  in  these  three  areas  is  the  project  focus  on  capacity  building. \n7. \nImproved  business  processes  and  public  service  delivery  cannot  be  implemented  and \nmaintained unless capacity development is an integral part of the new initiatives. Therefore, the \nproject seeks to build the capacity of government staff members concerned, including those of \nthe executing agencies. \n \nB. \n \nThe  intended  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  public  trust  in  central  government \n8. \nfor service delivery. The project outcome will be improved transparency and accountability in tax \nand  land  record  administrations. Its focus  on  e-governance  at  the  local  level  is  important  as  it \ncarries  forward  the  policy-based  reforms  of  the  ongoing  Good  Governance  Program  (footnote \n2).  The  project  will  be  spread  over  45  upazilas  in  five  districts,  in  relation  to  land  records \ndigitization,  and  in  20  information  and  service  centers  throughout  the  country,  in  relation  to \naccess to tax information.14 \n \nC. \n \n9. \n \n\nThe project will have three outputs: \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput 1: Online filing of tax returns. The areas that will be targeted here are \n(a) online filing of tax returns by designing the software, and (b) strengthening the \nICT capacity of the income tax circles.15  \n\nOutput 2: Digitized land records management system in selected districts. \nThe  project  will  help  pilot  a  digitized  land  records  management  system  in  45 \nupazilas (subdistricts) of five districts in phases, with necessary corrections in the \nproject implementation strategy. The activities will include (a) digitizing text data, \n(b)  digitizing  cadastral  paper  maps,  and  (c)  linking  all  spatial  and  text files. The \nproject will develop a web-based database of (a) land records in five districts and \n45  upazilas,  and  (b)  the  particulars  of  any  plot  of  land  including  its  map  and \nrecords of rights in the selected districts and upazilas.   \n\nOutput  3:  Improved  access  to  tax  and  land  information  in  specialized \ninformation  and  service  centers.  The  project  will  help  design,  set  up,  and \nmanage  (a)  20  tax  information  and  service  centers  at  the  major  income  tax \ncircles (including one at the National Board of Revenue office in Dhaka), and (b) \n20  land  information  and  service  centers  in  the  selected  upazilas  out  of  45 \nupazilas selected for digitized land record management system. The activities will \ninclude (a) creating an effective design for these centers, (b) procuring computer \nhardware,  (c)  planning  and  designing  the  information  and  service  contents  of \nthese centers,16 and (d) recruiting customer service associates to manage these \ncenters for a limited period.  \n\n 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n14 The selection of districts and upazilas shall be finalized in the immediate near term.  \n15 The country is geographically divided into 303 income tax circles for the purpose of revenue administration. \n16 It is envisaged that the taxpayers will file tax returns online from the tax information centers.

The  National  Board  of \nRevenue (NBR) will be the executing agency for outputs 1 and 3a and the Department of Land \nRecords and Survey (DLRS) will be the executing agency for outputs 2 and 3b. Each executing \nagency  shall  incorporate  a  dedicated  project  management  unit  (PMU).  A  project  steering \ncommittee (PSC) will be established to provide overall direction and guidance to\u2014and oversight \nand monitoring of\u2014the project. The secretary, Ministry of Land will chair the committee, which \nwill  include  one  senior  official  at  the  level  of  a  joint  secretary  of  the  relevant  ministries  and \nagencies. Two separate PMUs will be set-up\u2014one at NBR for outputs 1 and 3a,18 and the other \nat DLRS for outputs 2 and 3b.

Therefore, the \nproject will also focus on building the capacity of government officials concerned, including staff \nof  the  executing  agencies  and  implementing  agencies.  Thus,  it  is  proposed  that  the  TA  for \nSupporting  Governance  Management  Project  be  approved  and  provided  in  tandem  with  the \nStrengthening Governance Management Project in order to provide support to the government \nto  enhance  the  capability  of  the  relevant  agencies  to  effectively  manage  the  project.  The  TA \nproject  will  enhance  staff  members'  familiarization  with  rules  and  processes  and  help  them  to \nimplement  the  loan  components.  All  procurement  in  the  TA  project  will  be  managed  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  No \nadvance procurement or advance action is envisaged for the TA project. Capacity building will \ninclude the following three outputs  corresponding to the three project outputs: \n \n\nOutput  1:  Project  implementation  support;  preparing  the  income  tax  audit \nmanual  and  training;  setting  up  the  research  capacity  of  the  National  Board  of \nRevenue,  including  training  on  techniques  related  to  revenue  forecasts  and \ncompliance costs; and other training.19 \n\nOutput  2:  Creating  adequate  capacity  in  the  PMUs  to  implement  the  proposed \nactivities.  This  will  require  hiring  long-term  consultants  (project  implementation \nexpert and information technology expert) and training government staff. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii)  Output  3:  Creating  adequate  capacity  in  the  PMUs  to  implement  the  proposed \n\nactivities. \n\n \n16. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  project  is  estimated  at  $980,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance \n$800,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV)  to  be \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  remaining  $180,000  equivalent  will  be  contributed  by  the \ngovernment,  and  will  include  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  office  accommodation  and \nsupplies, local transport, and other logistical support.  \n \n17. \nThe implementation arrangements for the TA project will mimic those of the loan project. \nThe TA project components will be implemented by the relevant PMUs, with overall supervision \nby  the  PSC  and  coordination  by  the  PMU  (paras.  12\u201313).  A  total  of  139  person-months  of \nconsultancy  services  will  be  required,  including  6  person-months  of  international  consultant \nservices  and  133  person-months  of  national  consultant  services.20 A  consulting  firm  will  be \nengaged  for  recruiting  the  national  consultants  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod with a standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. All consultants will be recruited in line with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). No advance \ncontracting  or  retroactive  financing  is  envisaged  for  consulting  services.  All  disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).21  \n \n\n                                                 \n19 Training for using the e-filing software is also included in the project cost.  \n20 These experts are available locally. Moreover, the consultants need to be proficient in the local language (Bengali). \n21 Detailed terms of reference for the consultancy packages are on file with the project office, and are available upon \n\nrequest. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n18. \nOutputs  1  and  2  of  the  loan  project  have  technical  components  at  their  core. \nStrengthened  tax  administration  is  expected  to  be  brought  about  through  the  introduction  of \nonline  tax  filing  software  that  has  been  tested  and  standardized.  The  software  will  be \ncustomized to fit the Bangladesh context. Digitization of land records is to be done through an \nindustry  standard  as  well  as  one  adopted  by  other governments.22 Some  customization  of  this \napplication  is  expected.  Positive  impacts  of  the  introduction  of  technology  include  speedier \nprocesses,  and  so  reduced  compliance  costs.  There  are  no  expected  negative  impacts  as  a \nresult  of  introducing  the  technologies.  Capacity  building  support  in  the  project  will  help \ngovernment departments better manage the required technical operations. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nFinancial  analysis  performed  on  the  proposed  project  concluded  that  its  benefits \nconsiderably  outweigh  the  costs. 23  The  financial  viability  and  sustainability  analysis  of  the \nproject was based on main financial parameters and sensitivity analysis, and on a with-project \nand  without-project  scenario,  using  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  calculation  on  the  net \nbenefits  accruing  from  project  implementation.  The  sensitivity  analysis  also  demonstrated  the \nrobustness of these results, with the project being financially viable even when the combination \nof  changed  assumptions  in  a  worst-case  scenario  was  tested.  Comparisons  of  the  project \nbenefits  were  also  made  against  the  weighted  cost  of  capital.  The  economic  benefits  of  the \nproject are harder to calculate as they are not easily quantifiable. In this context, the least-cost \napproach  was  followed  while  designing  the  project  components  to  ensure  that  the  benefits  of \nthe project are most efficiently derived from the investment in this project.24  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  project  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \n21. \nA  governance  risk  assessment  of  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and \ncorruption was carried out. While public expenditure and financial accountability assessment for \nBangladesh  shows  some  systemic  weaknesses  in  the  public  financial  management  domain, \nthese are not expected to constrain effective project implementation. Governance weakness in \nthe area of procurement primarily arises from the fact that the Government has not necessarily \nadhered to some provisions in the Procurement Act in the recent past,25 and this has meant that \ngovernance  weaknesses  in  this  area  need  to  be  more  diligently  tracked,  and  national \ncompetitive bidding should follow the ADB guidelines. While there have been substantial policy \nreforms related to the fight against corruption, recent steps to weaken the independence of the \n\n                                                 \n22 For example, the National Land Resources Management Program in India. The National Informatics Centre in India \nis currently helping many states to develop  and  customize the software for this project  (e.g.,  see one  such  web-\nbased software application at http://tsu.trp.nic.in/jami/). Off-the-shelf software programs are also available. \n\n23 Financial and Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n24 Moreover,  detailed estimates of  the  fiscal gains of  the  project  arising out of higher  income  tax  and  land  revenue \n\nhave been worked out (Financial and Economic Analysis [Appendix 2]). \n\n25 For example, the government in 2009 abolished the clause on the need for 2 years experience for participating in \nbids  of  less  than  Tk20  million,  and  introduction  of  a  lottery  in  case  of  two  bidders  quoting  the  same  price.  This \nrelaxation could lead to bid manipulations by vested interested groups.  \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nanticorruption  commission  may  not  augur  well  for  progress  in  anticorruption  measures.  Some \nmajor  steps  of  the  government  (such  as  the  right  to  information  and  the  soon-to-be  approved \nnational integrity strategy) demonstrate the commitment to deal with malgovernance issues, but \nthe failure to yet put in place whistleblower protection measures or establish an ombudsman's \noffice, can be construed as weaknesses in the governance agenda of the government. \n \nD. \n \nThe  poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  are  very  positive,  although  not \n22. \nvery direct.26 Enabling online tax filing and easy and accurate access to land records will reduce \nthe  scope  for  human  interaction  with  government  officials,  thus  reducing  the  scope  for \ndemanding illicit extra payments for services. This is expected to reduce the degree of hairani \n(harassment) of the average citizen and business owner. Stemming the revenue losses inherent \nin the existing system of tax filing and improving the tax auditing ability  of the government will \nmean  increased  direct  revenues  for  the  government.  These,  in  turn,  become  available  for \nproductive  social  and  economic  infrastructure.  There  are  no  adverse  social  impacts  (such  as \nHIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  etc.)  of  the  project.  Moreover,  sex-disaggregated  data  on  land \nownership  and  taxpayers  will  help  future  advocacy  on  gender-targeted  policy  reforms  in  the \nareas of tax and land registration. \n \nE. \n \n23. \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized as C.  \n \nF. \n \n24. \nThe  key  risks  in  the  project  are  (i)  a  lack  of  government  commitment,  including \npersonnel, to continue with reforms and to allocate resources to implement them; (ii) a low level \nof  capacity  in  central  and  local  government  agencies  to  implement  the  reform  measures;  and \n(iii) an inability or unwillingness of the citizenry to use ICT and the information centers. Overall, \nhowever, while there are risks, the integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected \nto  outweigh  the  potential  costs  from  such  risks.  Further  analysis  on  the  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n \n25. \n\nGiven the nature of the project, all three safeguard categories (environment, involuntary \n\nThe major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk \n1.
