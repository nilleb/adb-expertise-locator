The  Project  adopts \n\ninfrastructure  and  service  delivery \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \n \nTargeting classification: Targeted intervention (TI-M)   \nSectors: Multisector (transport and communications; and water \nsupply, sanitation, and waste management)  \nSubsectors: Multimodal transport and sector development, water \nsupply and sanitation, and waste management   \nThemes: Governance, capacity development, gender and \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Civil society participation, institutional development, \ngender equity in capabilities   \n \nCategory  B:  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  six \nsample  subprojects  and  a  sector  IEE  were  undertaken.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  review  procedure  and  subproject \nenvironmental selection guidelines have been formulated to guide \nthe implementation of future subprojects.  \n \nThe  Second  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement \n(Sector)  Project  (the  Project)  supports  the  improvement  of  urban \nin \ngovernance  and  of \npourashavas \nthe \nperformance-based allocation of investment funds as an incentive \nmechanism  for  governance  reform.  Performance  criteria  are \ndefined  in  six  key  areas  of  urban  governance:  (i)  citizen \nawareness  and  participation,  (ii)  urban  planning,  (iii)  women\u2019s \nparticipation,  (iv)  integration  of  the  urban  poor,  (v)  financial \n(vi)  administrative \naccountability  and \nsustainability,  and \ntransparency. \nimprove \nto \nmunicipal  transport,  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  water \nsupply, sanitation, municipal facilities, and basic services in slums. \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  the  lessons  from  the  ongoing \nUrban  Governance  and \nImprovement  (Sector) \nProject (UGIIP-1).  \n \nUnplanned  and  rapid  urbanization  creates  large  unmet  demand \nfor  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  Pourashavas  have  not \nmanaged  to  meet  this  challenge  because  of  weak  governance, \nlimited  financial  and  human  resources,  and  a  lack  of  proper \nplanning.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported \nurban  development  with  a  series  of projects.  The  most  important \nlesson,  in  particular  from  the  ongoing  UGIIP-1,  is  that  the \nimprovement  of  urban  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  can  be \nachieved  more  effectively  by  linking  it  with  governance  reforms \nand  creating  a  proper  incentive  mechanism.  The  performance-\nbased allocation of investment funds creates a strong incentive for \npourashavas  to  reform  their  governance,  and  the  improved \ngovernance  ensures  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the \ncapital investments. \n\nfunds  will  be  utilized \n\nInfrastructure \n\nInvestment \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustained  improvement  in  the  urban \nenvironment  and  quality  of  life  in  target  pourashavas.  The \noutcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban  governance  and \nexpanded  access  to  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  target \npourashavas.    \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $167.5 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $10.7 million.   \n \nADB  will  provide  SDR  55,445,000  ($87  million  equivalent), \ncovering  51.9%  of \nthe  project  cost.

The  Government  of  Bangladesh  will  finance  the \nequivalent  of  $31.7  million,  covering  18.9%  of  the  project  cost. \nPourashavas  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $7.3  million  and \nbeneficiaries $0.7 million.   \n \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADF) \n\nSource \n\nGTZ \n\nKfW \n\nGovernment of Bangladesh \n\nPourashavas \n\nBeneficiaries  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare  \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n87.0 \n\n4.7 \n\n36.1 \n\n31.7 \n\n7.3 \n\n0.7 \n\n51.9 \n\n2.8 \n\n21.6 \n\n18.9 \n\n4.4 \n\n0.4 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \nADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  GTZ  =  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit, KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau. \nSources: Government of Bangladesh and Asian Development Bank estimates.    \n \n\n167.5 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n\nThe ADB loan from Special Funds resources will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. \n \nFor subprojects that generate cash revenues, 50% of project cost \nfor  class  A  pourashavas  and  30%  of  project  cost  for  Class  B \npourashavas will be relent with an amortization period of 20 years, \nincluding a 5-year grace period and an interest charge of 4% per \nannum.

In each target pourashava, a project \nimplementation unit will be established.   \n \nLocal Government Engineering Department \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  Government\u2019s \nPublic Procurement Rules (2008), as acceptable to ADB. National \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  applied \nfor  works \ncontracted  for  less  than  $2.0  million  and  will  be  the  major  mode \nfor civil works contracts, as the subprojects are small. Equipment \nand  materials  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive \nbidding  when \nthan  $500,000 \nequivalent.  \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided \nto  support  project \nimplementation  and  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \npourashavas  and  LGED.  Major  packages  are  package  1: \ngovernance \nimprovement  and  capacity  development,  and \npackage  2:  management,  design,  and  supervision.  Consultants \nwill  be  selected  and  engaged \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time),  and  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Rules \n(2008), as acceptable to ADB. The firms will be selected using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n \nAn  estimated  3.8  million  citizens  of  the  target  pourashavas  will \nbenefit  from  improved  governance,  infrastructure,  and  service \ndelivery.  Citizens,  in  particular  women  and  the  poor,  will  have \nenhanced  representation  in  urban  management.  The  poor  in \nslums  will  directly  benefit  from  the  provision  of  basic  services  in \nslums selected in each pourashavas.    \n \nA major assumption of the Project is that the performance-based \nallocation of investment funds will generate sufficient incentive for \npourashavas  to  carry  out  governance  reforms.  Also  assumed  is \nthat citizens are willing to participate in decision making, and that \nelected leaders and pourashava officials will listen and respond to \ncitizens\u2019  voices.  The  successful  experience  of  UGIIP-1  indicates \nthat \nthe  performance-based  allocation  mechanism  creates \nsufficiently  strong  incentives  for  governance  improvement.  It  is \nunlikely  that  pourashavas  will  find  significant  alternative  funding \nsources,  which  could  undermine  the  leverage  of  performance-\nbased  allocation.  Further,  enhanced  citizen  participation \nis \nassumed to establish sustainable incentives for elected leaders to \nimprove urban management and services.   \n\n \n\n\f\f89  00'Eo\n\no\n91  45'E\n\nBANGLADESH\nSECOND URBAN GOVERNANCE AND\nINFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT\n(SECTOR) PROJECT\n\nThakurgaon\n\nRangpur\n\nDinajpur\n\nKurigram\n\nT\n\ne\n\ne\n\ns\n\nt\n\na\n\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nGaibandha\n\n25  30'No\n\nI N D I A\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n25  30'No\n\nR A J S H A H I\n\nNachol\n\nBrahmaputra R.\n\nJ\n\na\n\nm\n\nu\n\nn\n\na\n\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nJamalpur\n\nMymensingh\n\nSunamganj\n\nSylhet\n\nS Y L H E T\nKu sh i ya ra  R .\n\nGolapganj\n\nGanges R.\n\nRajshahi\n\nNatore\n\nTangail\n\nSheepur\n\nSirajganj\n\nSreemangal\n\nGhorashal\n\nBrahmanbaria\n\nI N D I A\n\nMirzapur\n\nD H A K A\n\nDHAKA\n\nJhenaidah\n\nFaridpur\n\nP\n\na\n\nd\n\nm\n\nKolapara\n\na R.\n\nBhanga\n\nMunshiganj\n\nI N D I A\n\nBenapole\n\nNarail\n\nM\n\na\n\nd\n\nh\n\nu\n\nm\n\na\n\nt\ni\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nComilla\n\nChandpur\n\nM\n\ne\n\ng\n\nh\n\nn\n\na\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nChawmohoni\n\nNoakhali\n\nParshuram\n\nJhalakati\n\nBarisal\n\nBhola\n\nKhulna\nK H U L N A\n\nSatkhira\n\nBagerhat\n\n.\nR\n \nr\nu\ns\ns\nu\nP\n\nghala R.\n\nrin\na\nH\n\nBARISAL\n\nChittagong\n\n22  00'No\n\nBarguna\n\nCHITTAGONG\n\n22  00'No\n\nNational Capital\n\nDivisional Headquarters\n\nDistrict Headquarters\n\nNational Highway\n\nRiver\n\nDivisional Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n89  00'Eo\n\nCox's Bazar\n\nB a y    o f    B e n g a l\n\nMYANMAR\n\nSt. Martin's Island\n\no\n91  45'E\n\n08-1310 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure \nImprovement  (Sector)  Project  (the  Project).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n   \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nUrbanization. Bangladesh has experienced increased urbanization since independence \nin 1972. An estimated 38 million people lived in urban areas, or 27% of the total population, in \n2005.1 Though this level of urbanization is still relatively low, population growth in urban areas \nhas been high at 6% per annum since independence, compared with total population growth at \n2% per annum.2 With existing growth rates, the country\u2019s urban population will double by 2035 \nto  reach  74  million,  or  40%  of  the  total  population.3 The  contribution  of  urban  areas  to  the \nnational gross domestic product grew from 26% in 1973 to 42% in 1999. Rapid urbanization has \ncreated growing demand for urban infrastructure and services.  \n \nUrban  Infrastructure  and  Services.  The  development  of  urban  infrastructure  has  not \n3. \nkept  pace  with  rapid  urbanization,  causing  an  acute  shortage  in  every  urban  service.  Piped \nwater  is  available  in  only  one  third  of  pourashavas  (secondary  towns),  typically  only  for  2\u20134 \nhours  per  day.4 Water  quality  is  poor  in  many  pourashavas,  with  high  iron  content  or  arsenic \ncontamination.  No  urban  areas  have  sewerage,  with  the  exception  of  a  very  limited  system  in \nDhaka.  An  estimated  40%  of  households  resort  to  open  defecation  or  use  unsanitary  hanging \nlatrines.5 Only 20% of solid waste is collected, and households dump their solid waste directly \ninto  streets,  public  spaces,  and  drains.  Drainage  is  underdeveloped  and  poorly  maintained. \nDuring monsoon rains, roads and pathways become flooded, causing severe traffic congestion \nand risks to public health. As roads and bridges have insufficient capacity to meet growing traffic \nvolume, traffic jams in city centers limit access to economic opportunities and social services.  \n \nUrban Poverty. Despite significant progress, a large portion of the urban population still \n4. \nlives below the poverty line. Bangladesh achieved a significant reduction in the national poverty \nrate, which fell from 59% in 1991 to 42% in 2005 (footnote 3). The poverty rate in urban areas \ndeclined  from  45%  to  37%  in  the  1990s.6 Economic  opportunities  in  urban  areas  attract  large \nnumbers  of  migrants  from  rural  areas.  New  migrants,  as  well  as  second-generation  migrants, \ntend  to  live  in  slum  areas  without  decent  housing  or  basic  services.  Inequality  among \nhouseholds  is  acute  in  urban  areas,  with  the  rich  in  central  business  districts  and  the  poor  in \nurban slums. \n \n5. \nUrban Governance. Urban governance is weak and lacks effective citizen participation, \naccountability,  or  financial  management.  Pourashavas  are  governed  by  an  elected  mayor  and \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2006.

The  mayor  tends  to  dominate  decision  making  on  every  aspect  of  pourashava \nmanagement,  with  little  responsiveness  and  accountability  to  the  public.  Citizens,  in  particular \nthe poor and women, do not have effective avenues to influence decision making. Pourashavas \ndo  not  have  the  capacity  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  and  depend  on  budgetary  transfers \nfrom the central Government of Bangladesh (the Government), which account for more than half \nof the total revenues for most pourashavas. The collection efficiency of local taxes is very low. \nBetween  2000  and  2002,  only  29%  of  smaller  pourashavas  collected  more  than  half  of  their \nestimated holding tax, which is their most important own revenue source.7 Human resources are \nlimited, with many untrained staff and vacant approved posts.  \n \n6. \nUrban  Planning.  Most  pourashavas  do  not  have  a  plan  for  land  use  or  developing \ninfrastructure. This, combined with weak governance, means that investments tend to be made \nin an unplanned and discretionary manner. Class A pourashavas have an urban planner in the \napproved  organizational  chart,  but the  position  is  often  long  vacant.8 The  lack  of  proper  urban \nplanning leads to the inefficient allocation of available funds, further stressing limited resources.   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nKey  Issues.  Unplanned  and  rapid  urbanization  creates  large  unmet  demand  for  urban \ninfrastructure and services. Pourashavas have not managed to meet this challenge because of \nweak governance, limited financial and human resources, and a lack of proper planning, which \nare interlinked. Under the weak governance structure, elected leaders and pourashava officials \nlack  incentives  to  respond  to  citizens\u2019  needs  and  demands.  Pourashavas  do  not  generate \nsufficient financial resources for investment or staffing, and they do not have strong incentives \nto improve. Without an urban planner, no proper urban planning is carried out, which causes the \ninefficient use of the limited resources available. \n \n8. \nWell-planned  urbanization  can  significantly  reduce  poverty.  The  National  Strategy  for \nAccelerated  Poverty  Reduction 9  emphasizes  that  urbanization  has  so  far  been  a  factor \ncontributing  to  poverty  reduction,  and  that  urban  poverty  and  growing  disparities  within  urban \nareas  is  an  important  policy  issue.  According  to  the  strategy,  effective  poverty  reduction  is \nclosely linked to effective urbanization strategies. Furthermore, good governance is recognized \nas a critical factor encouraging economic growth and poverty reduction. The strategy includes \npublic  administration  reforms,  anti-corruption  measures,  decentralization,  and  strengthening \naccountability and participation. The detailed urban sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nExperiences and Lessons. The strategic thrust of assistance of the Asian Development \n9. \nBank  (ADB)  for  the  urban  sector  in  Bangladesh  has  been  poverty  reduction  through  shared \ngrowth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  ADB  has  been  a  leading  agency  in  urban \ndevelopment and has supported a series of projects. The most important lessons, in particular \nfrom the ongoing Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (UGIIP-1), \nindicate that the improvement of urban infrastructure and service delivery can be achieved more \neffectively  by  linking  it  with  governance  reforms  and  creating  a  proper  incentive  mechanism. \nThe following are the specific lessons: \n\n                                                 \n7  World  Bank.  2007.

In particular, the Project \nwill  continue  the  performance-based  allocation  of  investment  funds  with  defined  performance \ncriteria  for  governance  improvement.  The  performance  criteria  emphasize  citizen  participation, \nurban  planning,  and  financial  management  as  key  areas  for  improvement.  Past  external \nassistance to urban areas is listed Appendix 3, and a summary of lessons from the UGIIP-1 is in \nAppendix 4.  \n \nNational Reforms. Support for urban development in Bangladesh presents a significant \n11. \nopportunity  at  this  time.  In  addition to  the  ongoing  local  governance  reforms  supported  by  the \nUGIIP-1, the Government recently initiated a set of national reforms. The Government approved \nthe  new  Pourashava  Ordinance  (2008),  City  Corporations  Ordinance  (2008),  and  Local \nGovernment  Commission  Ordinance  in  May  2008.  The  new  Pourashava  Ordinance  (2008) \nreplaces  the  old  Pourashava  Ordinance  (1977)  and  strengthens  citizen  participation  and \naccountability  in  pourashavas.  The  Local  Government  Commission  is  the  country\u2019s  first \npermanent institution dedicated to policy guidance for local governments. \n \n12. \nADB has supported the national reforms. The new Pourashava Ordinance is one of the \nrecommendations made by the committee for urban local government, which was supported by \ntechnical assistance funded by ADB.10 The recommendations were based on the experiences in \ngovernance reform under the UGIIP-1. For example, each pourashava formed committees with \nrepresentation  of  broad  citizen  groups  under  the  UGIIP-1,  namely  the  town-level  coordination \ncommittee  (TLCC)  and  ward-level  coordination  committees  (WLCCs).  The  TLCC  and  WLCCs \nare forums to discuss various issues in the pourashava and ensure the participation of diverse \nsocial  strata  in  decision  making.  Recognizing  the  effectiveness  of  TLCCs  and  WLCCs,  the \nGovernment  made  committees  with  citizen  representatives  a  statutory  requirement  under  the \nnew Pourashava Ordinance (2008), and they have been utilized in other projects.11 \n \nFurther,  nationwide  institutional  frameworks  are  emerging  for  urban  development.  The \n13. \nLocal  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED),  which  traditionally  supports  infrastructure \ndevelopment in rural areas, is strengthening its urban management wing with a newly created \npost  of  additional  chief  engineer  to  manage  projects  in  urban  areas.  Under  the  urban \nmanagement wing, the Urban Management Support Unit (UMSU) was created by consolidating \ncapacity  development  programs  supported  by  various  projects.12 The  municipal  performance \n\n                                                 \n10 The technical assistance for Supporting Urban Governance Reform, approved on 28 November 2002, is attached \nto ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector) \nProject. Manila. The studies carried out under the technical assistance focused on the national urban sector policy, \nthe holding tax system, financial management, and the amendment of the Pourashava Ordinance (1977).   \n\n11  One example is the Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction Project funded by the United Nations Development \n\nProgramme and the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. \n\n12 UMSU  originally  provided  assistance  in  pourashavas  under  ADB  financing.  UMSU  is  merging  with  the  Municipal \n\nSupport Unit financed by the World Bank, which provides similar capacity development.   \n\n3\n        \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nreview  committee  (MPRC)  was  established  to  review  and  monitor  the  performance  of  all \npourashavas supported by different projects.13 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe impact of the Project is sustained improvement in the urban environment and quality \nof  life.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban  governance  and  expanded  access  to \ninfrastructure and services in target pourashavas.14    \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  Project  consists  of  three  components:  (i)  A:  urban  infrastructure  and  service \ndelivery,  (ii)  B:  urban  governance  improvement  and  capacity  development,  and  (iii)  C:  project \nmanagement and implementation support.   \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery \n\n16. \nThe  output  of  component  A  is  developed  infrastructure  and  improved  service  delivery, \nincluding municipal transport, drainage, solid waste management, water supply, sanitation, and \nmunicipal  facilities.  The  criteria  for  subproject  selection  are  in  Appendix  5.  The  subprojects  in \neach  pourashava  will  be  identified  through  participatory  urban  planning.  The  amount  of \ninvestment  funds  allocated  to  each  pourashava  depends  on  the  progress  of  its  governance \nreforms.  \n \n17.  Municipal  Transport.  Subprojects  in  municipal  transport  aim  to  reduce  traffic \ncongestion  and  improve  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services.  Investments \ninclude  the  (i)  repair,  rehabilitation,  and  expansion  of  pourashava  roads,  traffic  junctions,  and \nfoot paths; (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of bridges and culverts; (iii) development of riverboat \nlanding stations; (iv) procurement of equipment for routine maintenance; and (v) procurement of \nequipment for traffic management and road safety.    \n \n18. \nDrainage.  Subprojects  for  drainage  aim  to  mitigate  water  stoppages  and  inundation  to \nimprove  the  urban  environment  and  protect  public  health.  Investments  include  the  (i)  repair, \nrehabilitation,  and  expansion  of  the  existing  drains;  (ii)  construction  of  new  drains;  and  (iii) \nprocurement of equipment for maintenance.    \n \n19. \nSolid Waste Management. Subprojects in solid waste management aim to introduce or \nimprove  systems  to  collect,  segregate,  and  dispose  of  solid  waste  for  a  clean  urban \nenvironment  and  protecting  public  health.  Funds  will  be  utilized  for  the  (i)  procurement  of \ncollection and storage equipment; (ii) construction  of storage, treatment, and sanitary disposal \nfacilities;  and  (iii)  support  of  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  doing  house-to-house \nrefuse  collection.  The  Project  will  examine  the  potential  of  subprojects\u2019  registering  with  the \nClean Development Mechanism. \n\n                                                 \n13 The pourashava performance review committee, which was utilized under UGIIP-1, was merged with the MPRC. \n14 Thirty-five pourashavas have been identified as the original targets of the Project. They do not include pourashavas \ncovered  under  UGIIP-1  and  have  been  selected  based  on  the  weighted  scoring  of  various  factors,  including \ndemography,  economic  growth  potential,  infrastructure  deficiency,  investment  funds  received  in  recent  years, \nincidence  of  poverty,  and  regional  balance.  An  additional  15  or  so  pourashavas  will  enter  the  Project  during \nimplementation. Please refer to section D. Project Investment Plan, below.  \n\n\f \n20.  Water  Supply.  Subprojects  in  water  supply  aim  to  expand  service  areas  and  improve \nservice quality for better access to safe drinking water. Investments include the (i) rehabilitation \nand  expansion  of  distribution  networks;  (ii)  introduction  of  nonrevenue  water  reduction \nprograms;  (iii)  construction  of  tube  wells;  (iv)  procurement  of  equipment  for  metering  and \noperation and maintenance (O&M); and (v) construction of iron- and arsenic-removal facilities.15 \n \n21. \nSanitation.  Subprojects  in  sanitation  aim  to  improve  access  to  hygienic  sanitation  for \npublic health. Funds are utilized for (i) public and community sanitation facilities;16 (ii) procuring \nequipment for the maintenance of, and sludge removal from, facilities; (iii) constructing sludge \ndisposal facilities; and (iv) an awareness campaign for better hygiene.  \n \n22.  Municipal  Facilities.  Subprojects  in  municipal  facilities  aim  to  enhance  economic \npotential and improve urban amenities. Investments include the development, rehabilitation and \nexpansion  of  (i)  bus  and  truck  terminals,  (ii)  parking  areas,  (iii)  kitchen  markets  and \nslaughterhouses,  (iv)  municipal  parks  and  water  bodies,  (v)  street  lighting,  (vi)  urban \nlandscaping, and (vii) community centers. \n \n23. \nBasic  Services  in  Slums.  Subprojects  described  above  may  be  located  in  slum  and \nnon-slum  areas.  Subprojects  in  slums  will  be  identified  through  the  development  of  poverty \nreduction  action  plans  (PRAPs) 17 and  provide  basic  services  to  slum  dwellers.  Slum \nimprovement  committees  (SICs)  will  be  established  to  be  responsible  for  O&M.  To  ensure \nfinancial resources, a minimum of 5% of the investment funds allocated to each pourashava will \nbe earmarked for subprojects in slums.18 \n \n24. \nOperation  and  Maintenance.  Physical  assets  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by \npourashavas,  SICs,  and  CBOs.19 An  O&M  plan  for  physical  assets  will  be  prepared  by  each \npourashava, with support from the project management office (PMO) and consultants. The PMO \nand  consultants  will  provide  manuals  and  training  to  relevant  pourashava  staff  and  citizen \ngroups.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Governance Improvement and Capacity Development  \n\n25. \nThe  output  of  component  B  is  improved  governance  and  developed  capacity  in \npourashavas.  Pourashavas  will  carry  out  series  of  reform  activities  in  six  key  areas  defined  in \nthe  Urban  Governance  Improvement  Action  Program  (UGIAP):  (i)  citizen  awareness  and \nparticipation, (ii) urban planning, (iii) women\u2019s participation, (iv) integration of the urban poor, (v) \nfinancial  accountability  and  sustainability,  and  (vi)  administrative  transparency.  The  UGIAP  is \nused in UGIIP-1, and the Project adopts a refined version based on experiences and lessons. \nThe activities will be supported by training and facilitation. The performance of pourashavas will \nbe intensively monitored and assessed to determine the amount of investment funds allocated \nto them. The detailed fund-allocation mechanism and the UGIAP are in Appendix 6.   \n\n                                                 \n15 Major  works,  including  source  augmentation  and  the  expansion  of  trunk  mains,  will  be  considered  only  in \nexceptional  cases  and  designed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with  the  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering.  \n\n16 The Project will not finance individual household latrines.   \n17 If a pourashava is implementing a major project funded by the Government or development partners in a slum, in \n\nprinciple, the Project will not cover subprojects in that slum.   \n\n18 The  subprojects  outside  of  slums  may  not  utilize  the  earmarked  budget,  even  if  the  major  beneficiaries  are  poor \n\nhouseholds.   \n\n19 SICs focus on activities in slum areas, while CBOs work outside slums to manage community infrastructure.  \n\n5\n        \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n26. \nCitizen  Awareness  and  Participation.  Each  pourashava  will  form  a  TLCC,  and  each \nward will form a WLCC with broad representation of citizen groups.20 The TLCC and WLCCs will \nbe  forums  for  discussing  various  issues  in  the  pourashava  and  to  ensure  the  participation  of \ndiverse  social  strata  in  decision  making.  To  ensure  effective  participation,  the  selection  of \nmembers  will  follow  a  bottom-up  approach  to  the  extent  possible.  The  accountability  of \npourashavas  will  be  enhanced  by  establishing  a  citizen  charter,  introducing  a  citizen  report \ncard,21 and open discussions on budget proposals at TLCCs and WLCCs.    \n \n27. \nUrban  Planning.  Each  pourashava  will  formulate  a  pourashava  development  plan \n(PDP),  including  its  vision,  situation  assessment,  and  priority  investments  and  activities  for \nimproving  governance.  The  UGIAP  specifically  requires  pourashavas  to  recruit  an  urban \nplanner, 22 and  the  Project  will  provide  adequate  capacity  development  for  him  or  her.  The \nProject also supports internships for university students to strengthen urban planning capacity. \nA  land-use  plan  will  be  prepared  for  long-term  planning.  An  inventory  list  of  the  existing \ninfrastructure and an O&M plan will be prepared to ensure the efficient and effective utilization \nof physical assets.  \n \n28.  Women\u2019s Participation. A gender committee headed by a female ward councilor will be \nestablished,  and  a  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  will  be  developed  as  part  of  the  PDP  in  each \npourashava. The GAP will be developed with identified budget requirements and implemented \nunder the supervision of the gender committee as part of UGIAP performance criteria. TLCCs \nand  WLCCs  will  have  sufficient  female  representation  to  ensure  female  participation  in \npourashava governance.  \n \n29. \nIntegration of the Urban Poor. An SIC will be formed in each target slum, and a PRAP \nwill  be  developed  as  part  of  the  PDP.  The  SICs  will  be  responsible  for  managing  community \ninfrastructure  identified  in  the  PRAP.  Outside  of  slums,  CBOs  will  be  formed  to  manage \ncommunity  infrastructure  focusing  on  low-income  groups.  TLCCs  and  WLCCs  will  have \nsufficient  and  fair  representation  of  low-income  groups  to  ensure  their  participation  in \npourashava governance. Representatives of the poor will be nominated from among themselves \nand include the chairperson of the SIC. \n \nFinancial  Accountability  and  Sustainability.  Pourashavas  will  computerize  their \n30. \naccounting  and \nfinancial \nmanagement. An interim assessment of the holding tax will be carried out annually to ensure a \nfair  tax  base,  and  collection  efficiency  will  be  improved  to  enhance  financial  resources.  The \nimprovement of tax collection is one area in which substantial improvement was achieved under \nthe UGIIP-1. \n \nAdministrative  Transparency.  Elected  leaders,  pourashava  officials,  and  citizen \n31. \ngroups will participate in various training programs for administrative transparency and effective \nimplementation  of  the  UGIAP.  A  management  information  system  will  be  introduced,  and \ninformation disclosure will be strengthened for transparency in administration. \n \n\nthe  efficiency  and \n\ntransparency  of \n\ntax  records \n\nto  enhance \n\n                                                 \n20 Each pourashava is typically composed of several wards.  \n21 Introducing a citizen report card is one of the policies supported under ADB. 2007.

Manila (Loan 2362-BAN, approved on 30 October). \n22 Applicable to class A pourashavas only. For classes B and C, the assistant engineer serves as the urban planner, \n\nwith the support of consultants and facilitators.   \n\n\fSupport  for  National  Reform.  The  Project  supports  national  reforms  with  a  focus  on \n32. \nthe  UMSU,  MPRC,  and  Local  Government  Commission.  UMSU  provides  standard  training \nmodules  to  pourashavas,  which  are  covered  mostly  under  ADB  or  World  Bank  projects.  The \nProject  supports  UMSU\u2019s  expansion  of  the  types  of  training  offered  and  the  coverage  of \npourashavas beyond specific projects. The Government has started taking the MPRC\u2019s review \nof pourashavas\u2019 performance into consideration in allocating the national budget. However, the \nindicators  reviewed  are  limited  and  the  linkage  between  observed  performance  and  budget \nallocation  is  rather  weak,  with  substantial  discretionary  factors.  The  Project  supports  the \nMPRC\u2019s  enhancement  of  its  capacity  to  monitor  and  review  the  performance  of  pourashavas \nand  strengthen  the  linkage  between  performance  and  budget  allocation.  The  Project  also \nsupports the Local Government Commission\u2019s finalizing of national policy frameworks, including \nthe Urban Sector Policy and its implementing guidelines.      \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Project Management and Implementation Support  \n\n33. \nThe PMO in LGED and a project implementation unit (PIU) in each pourashava will be \nestablished  under  component  C  of  the  Project.  The  PMO  will  manage  overall  project \nimplementation,  and  the  PIUs  will  implement  activities  for  governance  improvement  and \nphysical infrastructure development with the support of consultants and facilitators.   \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n34. \nPerformance-Based  Allocation.  The Project adopts the performance-based allocation \nof investment funds, as this has been proven to be an effective incentive mechanism during the \nimplementation of UGIIP-1. The amount of investment funds to be allocated to each pourashava \ndepends  on  its  performance  in  improving  governance  as  defined  in  the  UGIAP.  In  phase  1, \npourashavas  start  governance  improvement  by  developing  a  PDP  and  formulating  essential \ninstitutions such as the TLCC, WLCCs, and CBOs. Only after successfully completing phase 1 \nwill  the  pourashava  proceed  to  phase  2  and  receive  funds  for  investment.  Pourashavas  will \nenter  phase  3  and  receive  additional  funding  if  they  meet  the  performance  criteria  required  in \nphase 2. The amount to be received varies depending on the level of performance. \n \nParticipatory  Urban  Planning.  The  Project  introduces  participatory  urban  planning  to \n35. \npourashavas through the development of PDPs. Broad citizen groups, including women and the \npoor, will be represented in the TLCCs and WLCCs, and a series of consultations will be carried \nout to formulate the PDP. Participatory urban planning makes elected leaders and pourashava \nofficials more accountable to the public and increases transparency in the use of resources and \ntheir performance.   \n \n36. \nPro-poor Urban Development. Each PDP will include a PRAP to identify and formulate \nspecific  actions  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  pourashava.  An  SIC  will  be  established  in  each \ntarget  slum  to  operationalize  the  PRAP.  The  TLCC  and  WLCCs  will  have  sufficient \nrepresentation of low-income group to ensure their participation in pourashava governance. To \nensure an adequate budget to implement the PRAP, a minimum 5% of investment funds will be \nearmarked to finance basic services in slums. \n \n37. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  The  Project  promotes  private  sector  participation  in  the \nmanagement  of  urban  infrastructure.  For  example,  the  operation  and  routine  maintenance  of \nbus  and  truck  terminals  will  be  outsourced  to  the  private  sector  through  competitive  bidding. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  solid  waste  management  will  be  examined  to  formulate  feasible \nmechanisms.   \n\n7\n        \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $167.5 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n38. \n$10.7 million.

Investment  funds  will  be  allocated  among \n39. \npourashavas based on their performance in governance improvement as defined in the UGIAP. \nThe  maximum  amount  to  be  allocated  to  each  pourashava  (the  investment  ceiling)  is  Tk250 \nmillion  for  class  A  pourashavas,  Tk200  million  for  class  B  pourashavas  and  Tk100  million  for \nclass C pourashavas, excluding in-kind contributions by pourashavas and beneficiaries.   \n \n40. \nPourashavas that successfully achieve all of the UGIAP performance criteria of phase 1 \nwill proceed to phase 2 and be entitled to utilize at most 50% of the investment ceiling. While it \nis  expected that  the  standard  period  of  phase 1  will  be  1.5  years,  pourashavas  can  enter  into \nphase  2  earlier  after  meeting  all  phase  1  performance  criteria.  The  MPRC\u2019s  assessment  of \npourashavas\u2019  performance  against  phase  1  criteria  will  be  carried  out  semiannually. \nPourashavas that fail to meet phase 1 performance criteria within 2 years of loan effectiveness \nwill lose entitlement for fund allocation.  \n \n41. \nAt the end of phase 2, which is expected to be in June 2012, pourashavas\u2019 performance \nwill  be  rated  by  the  MPRC.  The  rating  will  be  \u201cfully  satisfactory\u201d  if  the  pourashava  meets  all \nphase 2 performance criteria to a fully satisfactory level, \u201csatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava meets \nall minimum requirements of phase 2 performance criteria, or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava \nfails to meet all minimum requirements. The fully satisfactory pourashavas will receive at most \n50%  of  the  investment  ceiling,  the  satisfactory  pourashavas  will  receive  at  most  25%,  and \nunsatisfactory pourashavas will receive no additional funding.   \n \n\n\fAll class A and B pourashavas that are not included under the Project will be informed \n42. \nand encouraged to carry out UGIAP activities. New pourashavas that apply for funding will be \nranked  by  the  MPRC  based  on  their  level  of  achievement  of  UGIAP  performance  criteria. \nApproximately 15 pourashavas with the highest ranking will be entitled to receive at most 50% \nof the investment ceiling. In the middle of phase 2, the overall fund utilization will be assessed, \nand the candidate pourashavas will be identified. At the end of phase 2, the new pourashavas \nwill be determined by the interministerial steering committee subject to fund availability.  \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n43. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $87  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan will cover 51.9 % of the total project cost. ADB will \ncover approximately 70% of the pourashavas and finance 90% of their civil works23 and 100% of \ntheir equipment purchases. In addition, ADB will finance 100% of consulting services and 20% \nof incremental recurrent cost.     \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGTZ \nKfW \nGovernment of Bangladesh \nPourashava \nBeneficiaries \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n87.0 \n4.7 \n36.1 \n31.7 \n7.3 \n0.7 \n167.5 \n\nPercent \n51.9 \n2.8 \n21.6 \n18.9 \n4.4 \n0.4 \n100.0 \n\nGTZ = Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit, KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n  \n44. \nGerman  development  assistance  will  cofinance  the  Project  with  a  grant  of  \u20ac3  million \n($4.7 million equivalent) from GTZ and \u20ac23 million ($36.1 million equivalent) from KfW.

GTZ will support part of the capacity development program \nunder  the  Project.  The  funds  of  GTZ  and  KfW  will  be  provided  on  parallel  bases  and  self \nadministered.     \n \n45. \nThe Government of Bangladesh (the Government) will provide local funds equivalent to \n$31.7 million, covering 18.9% of the project cost by financing 10% of the civil works, 100% of \nland acquisition and resettlement, 100% of taxes and duties, and 80% of incremental recurrent \ncost.  Pourashavas  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $7.3  million  and  beneficiaries  $0.7  million. \nPourashavas  will  contribute  land,  resettlement  costs,  and  salvage  materials  for  civil  works. \nProject beneficiaries will contribute labor for the development of community infrastructure.   \n \n46. \nPart of the funds provided by the Government, ADB, and KfW will be relent to the target \npourashavas.  Civil  works  and  equipment  for  revenue-generating  subprojects,  including  water \nsupply, bus terminals, and truck terminals, will be financed 50% as a grant and 50% as a loan \nfor  class  B \nfor  class  A  pourashavas,  and  70%  as  a  grant  and  30%  as  a \n\nloan \n\n                                                 \n23 Excluding in-kind contributions by pourashavas and beneficiaries. \n\n9\n        \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\npourashavas. The loan will have an interest charge of 4% for 20 years, including a 5-year grace \nperiod,  and  will  be  denominated  in  local  currency. 24 The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange  risk  in  repayment  to  ADB.  All  other  types  of  subprojects  will  be  funded  100%  as  a \ngrant.   \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n47. \nThe  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project  will  be  LGED,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Local \nGovernment  Division  (LGD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives.  The  PMO  will  be  established  in  the  urban  management  wing  of  LGED.  Each \ntarget pourashava will establish a PIU. The diagram of implementation arrangements is shown \nin Appendix 8. \n \n48. \nInterministerial  Steering  Committee.  The  existing  interministerial  steering  committee \nof UGIIP-1 will be expanded to include the Department of Environment and be responsible for \nthe Project. The interministerial steering committee will be chaired by the secretary of LGD and \nconvene whenever necessary but not less than at least once every 3 months. \n \n49.  MPRC. The transparent and fair assessment of performance is critical for the successful \nimplementation of performance-based fund allocation. The MPRC will be responsible for rating \npourashavas. It will be chaired by the secretary of LGD and carry out its assessment and rating \nduties independently of the PMO.   \n \n50. \nPMO. The PMO will be established for the overall management of the Project. It will be \nheaded by a full-time project director,25 supported by two full-time deputy project directors, one \nin  charge  of  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  improvement  and  the  other  in  charge  of \ngovernance  improvement  and  capacity  development.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  (i) \nplanning  overall  project  implementation  by  consolidating  plans  at  the  pourashava  level;  (ii) \nassisting pourashavas in implementing the UGIAP and physical works; (iii) procuring, managing, \nand  supervising  consultants  hired  under  the  Project;  (iv)  monitoring  and  supervising  project \nimplementation;  (v)  ensuring  compliance  with  assurances,  including  safeguards;  and  (vi) \npreparing and submitting reports, including progress reports and the completion report.  \n \n51. \nUMSU.  The  UMSU  will  provide  standard  training  modules  to  pourashavas  in  close \ncoordination with the PMO. Training includes four standard modules: (i) computerization of tax \nrecords, (ii) computerization of accounting, (iii) inventory and mapping of infrastructure assets, \nand (iv) community mobilization. The UMSU will also function as the secretariat of the MPRC in \nassessing  the  performance  of  pourashavas.  The  superintending  engineer  in  the  urban \nmanagement wing of LGED will act as director of the UMSU, and the additional chief engineer \n(urban management) will coordinate activities between the UMSU and the PMO. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila (Loan \n1947-BAN [SF], for $60 million [ADF], approved on 28 November); and ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation \nof  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the \nSecondary Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila (Loan 2265-BAN [SF], for $41 million [ADF], \napproved on 16 October). \n\n25 The project director will be a senior engineer with the rank of at least executive engineer. \n\n\fPIU. A PIU will be established in each pourashava to implement the UGIAP and physical \n52. \nworks.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  the  pourashava  mayor,  who  will  be  assisted  by  the  chief \nexecutive officer. Each PIU includes three sections, the (i) infrastructure improvement section, \nheaded by the executive engineer;26 (ii) urban governance improvement section, headed by the \nsecretary;  and  (iii)  environmental,  sanitation,  and  slum  improvement  section,  headed  by  the \nhealth  officer.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  implementing  governance  improvement \nactivities  defined  in  the  UGIAP;  (ii)  implementing  physical  works,  including  preparing  bid \ndocuments, procuring and supervising contractors, and ensuring safeguard compliance; and (iii) \npreparing the detailed annual work plan and progress reports to the PMO.    \n    \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Agreements and Subsidiary Loan Agreements \n\nEach pourashava will enter into a subproject agreement with LGED prior to investment, \n53. \nonce  it  meets  the  UGIAP  performance  criteria  and  becomes  entitled  to  receive  investment \nfunds.  The  subproject  agreement  will  define  the  scope  of  the  subproject  and  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  pourashava  and  LGED.  Pourashavas  that  identify  revenue-generating \nsubprojects  and  thereby  qualify  to  receive  loan  funds  from  the  Government  will  enter  into  a \nsubsidiary loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance prior to investment. The subsidiary loan \nagreement will define the financial obligations of the pourashava, including repayment terms. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n54. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  2009  to  2014,  with  phase  1  from \nJanuary 2009 to June 2010, phase 2 from July 2010 to June 2012, and phase 3 from July 2012 \nto  December  2014.  Pourashavas  may\u2014and  are  encouraged  to\u2014proceed  to  phase  2  before \nJuly  2010.  The  assessment  of  pourashavas  against  the  phase  1  performance  criteria  of  the \nUGIAP  will  be  carried  out  semiannually.  Pourashavas  may  enter  into  phase  3  only  after  July \n2012,  as  phase  2  performance  criteria  will  be  assessed  over  the  fiscal  years  ending  in  June \n2011  and  June  2012.  The  LGED  organized  a  workshop  in  September  2008  to  announce  the \nUGIAP  to  the  target  pourashavas  and  request  them  to  start  advance  activities.  The  detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n55. \nProcurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Rules  (2008),  as  acceptable  to  ADB.  National  competitive \nbidding (NCB) procedures will be applied for works contracts below $2.0 million. NCB will be the \nmajor mode for civil works contracts, as subprojects are small. Equipment and materials will be \nprocured  under  international  competitive  bidding  when  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than \n$500,000  equivalent.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  contracts  with  an  estimated  cost \nbetween  $10,000  and  $100,000.  Minor  items  costing  less  than  $10,000  equivalent  may  be \npurchased through direct contracting. Bidding for NCB contracts estimated at $500,000 or more \nfor  goods  and  related  services,  or  $1  million  or  more  for  civil  works,  will  be  advertised  on  the \nADB website. The summary procurement plan is in Appendix 10.  \n  \n56. \nTo  expedite  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  and  KfW  approved  advance  action  to \nrecruit consultants and procure goods and services. The advanced engagement of consultants \n\n                                                 \n26 Assistant engineer for class B and C pourashavas. \n\n11\n        \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nis expected to reach the stage of technical proposal evaluation. The Government was informed \nthat approval of advance action does not commit ADB or KfW to finance the Project. \n  \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n57. \nConsulting  services  are  provided  to  support  project  implementation  and  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  capacities  of  the  pourashavas  and  LGED.  The  consulting  services  will  include  96 \nperson-months  of  international  consultancy  and  4,878  person-months  of  national.  Major \npackages  are  package  1:  governance  improvement  and  capacity  development  (GICD)  and \npackage 2: management, design, and supervision (MDS). The outline of terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 11.  \n \nThe  GICD  package  will  require  876  person-months  of  national  consultancy.  GICD \n58. \nconsultants will support the PIUs in implementing the UGIAP by providing capacity development \nand  facilitation  for  urban  planning,  municipal  finance,  and  community  mobilization.  The  MDS \npackage will require 96 person-months of international consultancy and 3,318 person-months of \nnational.  MDS  consultants  will  support  the  PIU  in  engineering  design,  bid  management,  and \nsupervising  physical  works.  MDS  consultants  will  also  support  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard measures. The consultants will provide intensive capacity building and other support \nin the initial phase of the Project that will subsequently be phased out. \n \n59. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Governments\u2019  Public \nProcurement Rules (2008), as acceptable of ADB. The firms will be selected using the quality-\nand cost-based selection method.27 \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n60. \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  LGED  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n61. \nThe  proposed  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nADB  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency.  LGED  will  create  a  project \nwebpage  to  disclose  information  about  various  project  matters,  including  procurement.  With \nregard  to  procurement,  the  website  will  include  information  on,  among  other  things,  the  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  the  bidding  procedures \nadopted, the amount of contract awarded, and the goods and/or services procured. As part of \nthe  UGIAP,  each  pourashava  will  form  a  TLCC  with  broad  citizen  representation  to  discuss \nvarious  issues  of  pourashava  governance.  Detailed  information  on  procurements  in  their \nrespective pourashavas will be provided in the TLCC to supplement the web-based disclosure.  \n \n\n                                                 \n27 The weight for technical quality will be 80% and for cost 20%. \n\n\f7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n62. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. For larger contracts, direct payment and commitment letter procedures \nwill be used.  For other activities, an imprest account will be established at the Bangladesh Bank, \nwhich will fund a second-generation imprest account (SGIA)28 at a commercial bank selected in \naccordance with the Borrower\u2019s procedures and acceptable to ADB.29 The imprest account and \nthe  SGIA  will  be  operated  by  LGED.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  these  imprest \naccounts  shall  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  6  months\u2019  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed \nfrom imprest account, or 10% of the loan, whichever is less.   \n \nA third-generation imprest account (TGIA)30 will be established by each pourashava at a \n63. \ncommercial  bank  selected  in  accordance  with  the  Borrower\u2019s  procedures  and  acceptable  to \nADB and will be operated by the pourashavas. The Government shall assure ADB that all ADB \ndisbursements for imprest advance and/or replenishment for payment by PIUs will be passed on \nto  TGIAs  within  30  calendar  days  of  the  receipt.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  each \nTGIA shall not exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditures to be financed from \nthat account. The aggregate of the TGIAs shall not exceed the equivalent of ten (10) percent of \nthe Loan amount. The TGIAs are necessary as project implementation will be at the pourashava \nlevel.  \n \n64. \nThe imprest account, SGIA, and TGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed \narrangements between the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures may be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest \naccount,  SGIA,  and  TGIAs  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed  arrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Any  individual  payment  to  be \nreimbursed  or  liquidated  under  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent of $100,000.   \n \n65. \nLGED  has  the  proven  capacity  to  manage  the  financial  transactions,  evidenced  by  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  UGIIP-1.  Pourashavas  will  be  capable  of  managing  the \nfinancial transactions with capacity development and support from the PMO. The PMO will be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  accounts,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of  the  accounts  and  the \npreparation of the withdrawal applications for liquidation or replenishment of the imprest account. \nThe  disbursement  of  KfW  funds  will  be  managed  with  equivalent  procedures.  Supplementary \nAppendix G describes detailed financial management and disbursement arrangements.  \n  \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n66. \nThe PMO will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods and services financed \nby  the  proceeds.  Each  PIU  will  maintain  similar  records  and  submit  annual  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements  to  the  PMO  for  further  submission  to  ADB.  The  PMO  and  PIUs  will  be \nstaffed  with  an  adequate  number  of  suitably  qualified  accounting  personnel.  Additionally,  the \nPIUs will be assisted by an account assistant deputed by LGED and consultants in establishing \nand managing accounting and recording procedures.  \n                                                 \n28 SGIA is referred as project operating account in Bangladesh, \n29 The Government requires the PMO to open the first generation imprest account in the Bangladesh Bank, which is \n\nthe country\u2019s central bank, but an account in a commercial bank is needed for day-by-day transactions.   \n\n30 TGIA is referred as project account in Bangladesh. \n\n13\n        \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n67. \nThe Government will ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually \nin  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nLGED will provide to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified \ncopies of audited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor of them. The \nimprest account and statement of expenditure records will be audited annually, and a separate \naudit opinion will be provided for each.   \n \nThe PIU will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to the PMO within 15 \n68. \ndays  of  the  end  of  the  applicable  period.  The  PMO  will  compile  them  and  prepare  quarterly \nprogress reports and submit them to ADB and LGD within 30 days of the end of the applicable \nperiod.  The  reports  to  ADB  will  be  prepared  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  include  the \nfollowing:  (i)  project  progress  in  each  pourashava  regarding  both  physical  works  and \ngovernance improvement, (ii) any delays or problems encountered and the actions to be taken \nto resolve them, (iii) compliance with loan covenants, and (iv) the progress expected during the \nnext  6  months.  Within  6  months  of  the  Project\u2019s  physical  completion,  the  Government  will \nprepare and submit to ADB a project completion report.   \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation    \n\nThe PMO will ensure that a project performance monitoring system, which will operate \n69. \nthroughout  the  implementation  period  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  the  ADB.  The  system  will \nassess the progress and performance of physical works and governance-improvement activities \nin  each  pourashava  with  defined  reporting  procedures  from  the  PIU  to  the  PMO.  A  set  of \nindicators  will  be  developed  at  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project  by  the  PMO,  based  on  the \nexperiences of the UGIIP-1. The PMO, with the support of consultants, will compile information \nincluding socioeconomic, gender and poverty indicators through surveys, reports, and statistical \npublications.  The  PMO  will  conduct  on-site  monitoring  to  observe  activities  and  receive  direct \nfeedback from stakeholders. The PMO will conduct initial baseline physical and socioeconomic \nsurveys and submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring performance and benchmark \nindicators for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 9 months from loan effectiveness.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n70. \nThe Government, ADB, GTZ, and KfW will jointly review the Project\u2019s progress at least \ntwice  a  year.  In  addition  to  the  regular  reviews,  the  Government,  ADB,  GTZ,  and  KfW  will \nundertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  within  3  years  from  loan  effectiveness.  These \nreviews  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements, \nfinancing  plan,  achievement  of  scheduled \ntargets  on  both  physical  and  governance \nimprovement,  fund  allocation  mechanism,  UGIAP  performance  targets,  and  performance  of \ncommittees, consultants and LGED. The midterm review will be carried out at the end of phase \n2 of the Project, and the overall progress of the UGIAP and fund utilization will be assessed to \ndetermine the exact number of new pourashavas to enter the Project.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\nEconomic  Analysis.  Since  the  Project  is  formulated  as  sector  lending,  the  economic \n71. \nanalysis focuses on the rationale for government involvement, government plan and approach, \neconomic policies, and government capacity. The Project has a clear rationale for government \n\n\finvolvement. The infrastructure to be developed under the Project is to meet the basic needs of \ncitizens in target pourashavas. The goals and Government\u2019s approach are sound. Bangladesh \nhas  experienced  rapid  urbanization,  which  has  caused  acute  shortages  of  basic  infrastructure \nand social services in urban areas. The target pourashavas were selected through a transparent \nscoring of various factors. The subprojects will be selected by developing the PDP with broad \nparticipation to ensure a balanced distribution of benefits. The government\u2019s policy to improve \nthe governance of pourashavas, including better urban planning and financial management, will \nbe  supported  by  the  Project.  The  LGED  has  been  successfully  implementing  the  UGIIP-1, \ndemonstrating sufficient capacity to implement the Project.   \n \n72. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  subprojects  is  conducted  for  the  six  subprojects  in  pilot \npourashavas.  The  estimates  of  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  sample \nsubprojects range from  17% to 44%, indicating sufficiently high economic return. The result is \nrobust against downside risks, including increased capital cost, increased O&M cost, decreased \nbenefits,  and  delay  in  project  completion.  These  results  are  most  likely  underestimated,  since \nthe projects have benefits that are not easily quantifiable and not accounted for in the analysis.   \n \n73. \nFinancial  Analysis.  Most  subprojects  to  be  developed  under  the  Project  do  not \ngenerate cash revenues, while others, including water supply and bus terminals, generate cash \nrevenues  through  user  charges.  For  revenue-generating  subprojects,  financial  analysis  is \nconducted by estimating the incremental costs and the revenues over the project life. Financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  are  estimated  at  5.9%  for  the  water  supply  subproject  in \nRangpur  and  7.1%  for  the  bus  terminal  subproject  in  Bhanga,  which  compared  favorably  with \nthe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  estimated  at  3.3%.  Sensitivity  analysis  with \nrespect  to  changes  in  cost  and  revenue  assumptions  confirmed  the  robustness  of  financial \nviability against these downside risks.   \n \n74. \nFor  nonrevenue-generating  subprojects,  the  analysis  focuses  on  the  pourashavas\u2019 \nfinancial  capacity  to  meet  the  recurrent  costs  of  the  subprojects  to  operate  and  maintain  the \ndeveloped physical assets in a sustainable manner. The overall financial position of each pilot \npourashava is projected, reflecting the incremental capital, O&M expenditures, revenue through \nuser  charges,  and  debt  service.  The  projected  financial  position  confirmed  their  financial \ncapacity  to  meet  O&M  costs  and  other  requirements  to  sustain  infrastructure  and  service \ndelivery supported under the Project.    \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development \n\n75. \nCitizen  Participation.  The  main  social  issues  identified  in  pourashavas  are  (i)  weak \nparticipation  and  representation  of  citizens,  particularly  the  poor  and  women,  in  pourashava \ngovernance;  and  (ii)  a  lack  of  access  to  basic  urban  services  for  the  poor.  The  Project \nstrengthens  citizens\u2019  participation  through  the  formation  of  TLCCs  and  WLCCs  with  broad \nrepresentation. All subprojects to be funded under the Project will be selected in a participatory \nmanner to ensure that benefits are shared by a broad range of socioeconomic groups.  \n \nUrban  Poor.  The  Project  includes  specific  supports  for  the  urban  poor.  Each \n76. \npourashava  is  required  to  utilize  at  least  5%  of  allocated  funds  to  improve  basic  services  in \nslums. An SIC will be established in each target slum to develop and implement a PRAP that \nidentifies  and  formulates  the  specific  infrastructure  and  activities  for  poverty  reduction.  TLCCs \nand WLCCs will have sufficient representation of low-income groups to ensure their participation \nin decision making. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n15\n        \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nto  ensure  women\u2019s  participation \n\nGender. The Project contributes to gender mainstreaming through the development and \n77. \nimplementation  of  a  GAP  in  each  pourashava.  TLCCs  and  WLCCs  will  have  sufficient  female \nrepresentation \nin  pourashava  governance.  Certain \ninfrastructure  to  be  developed  under  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  women.  For  example, \ndeveloping  water  supply  and  sanitation  will  reduce  the  burden  on  women,  who  traditionally \ncollect water and manage sanitation. The summary gender action plan is in Appendix 13.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nthe \n\nthrough \n\nrequirements,  an  environmental  assessment \n\n78. \nEnvironment  Safeguards.  LGED  has  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations \n(IEEs)  for  six  sample  subprojects,  a  sector  IEE,  and  an  environment  assessment  and  review \nprocedure \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003).  The  IEEs  show  that  benefits  are  positive  and  large,  with  infrastructure \nsubprojects:  (i)  improving  the  environment  in  pourashavas  by  reducing  people\u2019s  exposure  to \npollutants  through  improved  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  drainage,  and \nmunicipal  transport;  (ii)  improving  aesthetics  with  drainage  and  solid  waste  management;  (iii) \nreducing flooding through drainage improvement; and (iv) other social benefits from subprojects \nfor  the  poor  that  use  an  integrated  approach  and  provide  such  basic  urban  services  as \ncommunity water supply and sanitation. The Project will improve biological systems that rely on \nhealthy  aquatic  environments \nimproved  protection  of  surface  water  and \ngroundwater quality. \n \n79. \nAny  adverse  environmental  impact  can  be  addressed  through  properly  locating, \nplanning,  and  design  proposed  subprojects;  controlling  construction  activity;  properly \nmaintaining  systems  following  commissioning;  and  other  mitigation  measures.  The  principal \ncumulative,  regional,  and  long-term  environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be  beneficial.  The \nIEEs  conclude  that  no  further  assessment  of  environmental  impacts  is  required  for  sample \nsubprojects. To ensure compliance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines \nreview  procedure  and  subproject \nand \nenvironmental selection guidelines to guide the implementation of future subprojects have been \nformulated.31 A summary IEE is in Appendix 14. \n \nSocial Safeguards. To ensure compliance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policy and \n80. \nrequirements on involuntary resettlement, a resettlement framework to guide the implementation \nof  subprojects  has  been  formulated by  LGED.  A summary  of  the  resettlement  framework  is  in \nAppendix  15.  LGED  prepared  draft  resettlement  plans  for  three  sample  subprojects  following \nthe  Government\u2019s  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  (1982, \namended  in  1993  and  1994),  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the \nresettlement framework for the Project.  \n \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts. \n81. \nPourashavas will (i) utilize existing lands for rehabilitating existing water supply, drainage, and \nmunicipal facilities, and for basic urban services to the urban poor; (ii) utilize vacant pourashava \nor community land and ensure community consensus in siting public and community toilets and \ndeep  tube  wells;  (iii)  align  roads  and  bridges  to  avoid  impacts  on  structures;  and  (iv)  utilize \nvacant  pourashava  land  for  solid  waste  management  that  will  not  pose  health  hazards  to \n                                                 \n31 The  environmental  assessment  review  procedure  documents  procedures  for  the  environmental  assessment  of \nsubprojects,  including  categorization,  preparing  environmental  assessments,  requirements  for  environmental \nmanagement  plans,  and  procedures  for  public  consultation.  The  section  specifies  that,  should  a  subproject \nunexpectedly  be  classified  as  A,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  would  be  required.  Public  disclosure \nrequirements for category A, including the 120-day requirement, are in the procedure. \n\n\fsettlements. Impacts are to be further minimized through careful subproject siting and alignment \nduring  detailed  design  and  subproject  implementation.  In  the  three  sample  subprojects, \npermanent  land  acquisition  required  for  road  improvement  is  0.024  hectares,  affecting  five \nhouseholds.  Impacts  from  road  improvements  and  the  construction  of  a  bus  terminal  will  be \ntemporary and minimal, as the work will be undertaken on road shoulders and pourashava and \nother government land. \n \n82. \nScreening for impact on indigenous peoples shows that the sample subprojects have no \nimpact on them. By design, as reflected in the subproject selection criteria, a subproject will not \nbe eligible if it adversely affects indigenous communities. An indigenous peoples development \nframework  has  been  formulated  to  ensure  that  appropriate  indigenous  peoples  development \nplans  or  specific  actions  are  formulated,  enabling  equal  sharing  of  project  benefits  should  a \nfuture subproject have impacts on indigenous peoples. \n \nD. \n\nMajor Risks and Assumptions \n\nThe major assumption of the Project is that performance-based allocation of investment \n83. \nfunds  will  generate  sufficient  incentive  for  pourashavas  to  carry  out  a  series  of  activities  for \ngovernance  reform  as  defined  in  the  UGIAP.  Also  assumed  is  that  citizens  are  willing  to \nparticipate  in  decision  making  through  TLCCs  and  WLCCs,  and  that  elected  leaders  and \npourashava  officials  will  listen  and  respond  to  their  voices.  The  successful  experience  in  the \nUGIIP-1 indicates that performance-based allocation will create sufficiently strong incentives for \ngovernance improvement. Given limited fund availability, it is unlikely that pourashavas will find \nsignificant  alternative  funding  sources,  which  could  undermine  the  incentive  mechanism  of \nperformance-based allocation. Further, it is assumed that enhanced citizen participation in and \nmonitoring of the MPRC will establish a sustainable incentive mechanism for elected leaders to \nrespond to citizens\u2019 demands for better urban management and services.  \n \nOther assumptions include the acceptability of a water tariff and the timely placement of \n84. \nan urban planner in each PIU. The risk of these factors having significant impacts on the Project \nis assessed to be limited. Water supply is a minor component of the Project, and the tariff will be \nproposed  at  an  acceptable  level  considering  the  income  level  and  practices  in  other \npourashavas.  The  placement  of  urban  planner  is  included  in  the  UGIAP  performance  criteria \nand the assurances of the loan agreement, so that governments have a sufficient incentive to \nensure timely placement.        \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n85. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  all  required  and  agreed  counterpart  funds  for \nproject implementation on time.  \nLGED  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are  selected  and  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria  agreed  between  ADB  and \nLGED and set out in Appendix 5. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  investment  funds  will  be  allocated  among \npourashavas in accordance with the guidelines set out in Appendix 6.  \nLGED  will  ensure  that  at  least  5%  of  the  investment  funds  allocated  to  a \nparticular  pourashava  will  be  earmarked  for  and  spent  on  basic  services  in \nslums.  \n\n17\n        \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nLGED  will  ensure  that  there  will  be  no  overlap of  activities or  program  between \nADB-funded subprojects and projects funded by other development partners. \nThe  guidelines  concerning  pourashava  development  plans  will  include  specific \nprovisions for the representation of women and the urban poor in the TLCC and \nWLCCs in each pourashava. Each TLCC will have at least seven representatives \nof  the  urban  poor,  and  each  WLCC  at  least  two;  they  will  be  appointed  by  the \nrespective chairperson but will be nominated by the urban poor themselves and \nwill include the SIC chairperson where an SIC exists, as well as representatives \nfrom CBOs. In addition, there will be at least seventeen female TLCC members \nand four female WLCC members in each pourashava.  \n\n(vii)  Within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  conduct  initial  baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation-\nmonitoring  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  concurrence.  Within  9  months  of  loan \neffectiveness, the PMO and each PIU will establish a gender-segregated project \nperformance management system. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(xii) \n\n(viii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each  PIU  of  a  class  A  pourashava  will \nhave an urban planner in place. LGD will ensure that this position remains filled \nthroughout project implementation.  \nLGD will take all appropriate and necessary measures to ensure that, at all times \nduring  project  implementation,  the  PIUs  have  at  least  80%  of  all  their  positions \nfilled. \nThe  Government  will  take  all  appropriate  and  necessary  measures,  including \nthrough  bonding  arrangements  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and \nguidelines,  to  ensure  that  pourashava  officials  who  receive  training  under  the \nProject will not be transferred out of the pourashavas under the Project. \nThe Government will ensure that, within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the Urban \nSector Policy will have been approved. Within 6 months of approval of the policy, \nthe Government will have approved its implementing rules.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  to  cover  the  costs  of  land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement are made available in a timely manner. \nAll land and right-of-way required will be made available in a timely manner, and \ncompensation  at  replacement  value  and  other  entitlements  will  be  paid  to \naffected  people  prior  to  the  award  of  any  civil  works  contract.  Any  involuntary \nresettlement  or  land  or  asset  acquisition  will  be  in  compliance  with  the \nresettlement  framework  agreed  between  LGED  and  ADB,  and  the  resettlement \nplan for the subproject. Pourashavas will publicly disclose the draft resettlement \nplan  in  places  and  using  language  accessible  to  all  affected  people,  prior  to \nsubmitting to ADB the resettlement plans for review and approval and disclosure \non  ADB\u2019s  website.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \nLGED will ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and relevant \nnational  and  local  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  All  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  mechanisms  set  out  in  the  IEEs,  as  well  as  all  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures,  will  be  complied  with  throughout  Project \nimplementation. LGED  will ensure environmental requirements are incorporated \nin bidding documents and civil work contracts. \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv)  LGED will ensure that subprojects are prepared and implemented in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  the  Indigenous  Peoples \nDevelopment Framework for the Project.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for construction or maintenance \n\n(xv) \n\n\factivities,  and  do  not  differentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of \nequal value. \n\n(xvi)  The Government will ensure that the birth registration requirements of the 2004 \nBirth  and  Death  Registration  Act  and  its  implementing  rules  will  not  be \nimpediments to obtaining urban services, in particular utility connections.  \n\n(xvii)  LGED  will  ensure \n\nin  project \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  the  Project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  and  that \nsufficient resources will be allocated for its implementation. \n\nissues  are  duly  considered \n\nthat  gender \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n86. \nI am

The  share  is  almost  50%  at  present,  which  underlines  the \nimportance of urban centers in achieving economic growth and poverty reduction. Despite their \nimportance,  urban  areas  have  not  traditionally  received  sufficient  attention  toward  developing \npolicies  and  funding  capital  investments.  The  result  is  unplanned  and  uncontrolled  urban \ngrowth,  which  has  caused  acute  shortages  of  infrastructure,  including  poor  housing  and \ntransport, inadequate drinking water, and a lack of drainage and sewerage.      \n  \nB. \n \nUrban  residents,  in  particular  low-income  groups,  suffer  a  lack  of  basic  urban \n3. \ninfrastructure  and  services.  Though  95%  of  the  population  has  access  to  water  supply,  only \n30%  of  urban  households  drink  tap  water  and  fewer  than  20%  have  their  own  house \nconnections.  The  water  quality  is  very  poor,  with  arsenic  and  bacteriological  contamination \ncommon.  There  are  virtually  no  water  treatment  facilities,  and  even  where  treated  water  is \navailable  it  is  often  contaminated  at  consumer  points  due  to  the  poor  condition  of  pipes  and \nintermittent water flow. \n \n4. \nMost  households  use  septic  tanks  and  pit  latrines  without  proper  sludge  removal \nprograms.  Wastewater  tends  to  flow  into  low-lying  areas  and  open  drains  without  treatment, \ncausing  significant  health  risks.  During  monsoon  rains,  roads  and  pathways  that  lack  drains \nbecome flooded, impeding access to houses and posing health risks to residents. Solid waste \ndisposal  is  another  major  problem  in  urban  areas,  particularly  in  slums  and  other  densely \npopulated areas. Only around 20% of urban households are covered by a solid waste collection \nsystem. \n \n5. \nOnly 25% of urban households live in permanent structures (footnote 1), and the rest live \nin  temporary  kutcha  structures  in  illegal  settlements  with  uncertain  tenure  and  no  access  to \nbasic urban services. Surveys of the urban poor have shown that access to piped water is very \nlimited.  In  Rangpur,  for  example,  piped  water  reaches  only  25%  of  the  population,  with  the \nprovision of merely 20 liters per capita per day, and 48% of the population gets water only from \nhand-pumped tube wells.  \n \nAccording to the National Sanitation Strategy5 about 40% of households resort to open \n6. \ndefecation or use unsanitary hanging latrines. Most slum dwellers rarely use community toilets \nbecause they are poorly maintained. Slum areas rarely have solid waste-management systems, \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2006.

Air \nand water pollution is common in most urban areas.    \n \nC. \n \nBangladesh  has  made  steady  progress  toward  achieving  the  Millennium  Development \n7. \nGoals, though the challenges remain daunting. Between 1992 and 2005, Bangladesh reported a \nsignificant reduction in people living below the poverty line, from 59% to 42%, one of the fastest \ndeclines  in  the  world  (footnote  3).  The  urban  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  declined \nfrom  45%  to  37%  during  the  1990s.6 Later  estimates  have  indicated  that  urban  poverty  has \nbeen  reduced  further  to  30%.  Bangladesh\u2019s  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty \nReduction7 addresses  other  urban  issues  as  well,  recognizing  the  potential  of  urbanization  to \nreduce poverty and emphasizing the need for a holistic perspective on urban poverty.  \n \nEconomic  opportunities  in  urban  areas  attract  large  numbers  of  migrants  from  rural \n8. \nareas.  New  migrants,  as  well  as  second-generation  migrants,  tend  to  live  in  slum  areas  with \nsubstandard  housing  and  no  basic  services.  Inequality  among  households  is  acute  in  urban \nareas, contrasting the rich in central business districts and the poor in urban slums. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe structure of local urban governments has remained unchanged for a long time. It is \na  two-tier  structure  with  city  corporations  for  the  largest  six  cities  and  pourashavas  for  the \nremaining 300 or so smaller cities. Local urban governments are formed through a democratic \nelection  process,  with  the  mayor  and  councilors  elected  by  direct  vote  of  citizens.  However, \nlocal  urban  governments  do  not  enjoy  political,  administrative,  or  financial  autonomy.  For \nexample, they cannot themselves employ high-level staff, as these are recruited and appointed \nby  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  under  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment,  and  Cooperatives.  Within  local  urban  government,  administrative  authority  is \nconcentrated in the mayor. \n  \n10.  Municipalities  are  mandated  to  provide  urban  services,  including  (i)  maintaining  roads, \ndrainage,  and  parks;  (ii)  operating  water  supply  systems,  community  toilets,  markets,  solid \nwaste management, and slaughterhouses; (iii) delivering public health and other basic services \nfor  the  urban  poor;  and  (iv)  development  and  building  control.  In  practice,  however, \nmunicipalities  lack  the  institutional  capacity  to  provide  these  services.  Municipalities  have \napproved organizational charts, but many posts are long left vacant. \n \n11. \nInsufficient  financial  resources  are  another  reason  why  municipalities  cannot  provide \nadequate  infrastructure  and  services.  Municipalities  depend  on  the  national  Government  for \nmuch of their financial sources, and their own financial resources are limited by a small tax base \nand  low  collection  efficiency.  Between  2000  and  2002,  only  29%  of  smaller  pourashavas \ncollected  more  than  half  of  their  estimated  holding  tax,  which  is  the  most  important  source  of \nown  revenue  (footnote  2).  Consequently,  there  is  a  chronic  shortage  of  funds  for  capital \nexpenditure as well as for operation and maintenance. \n \nE. \n \n12. \nAlthough the Government has long been aware of the rapid pace of urbanization and the \nassociated  physical,  economic,  and  social  problems,  it  has  not  yet  managed  to  formulate  a \ncomprehensive  urban  policy.  Efforts  have  been  made  over  the  past  2  decades  to  develop \npolicies  for  specific  areas  like  housing,  planning,  and  urban  services.  The  National  Housing \nPolicy  (1993),  Bangladesh  Urban  and  Shelter  Review  (1993),  Bangladesh  Urban  Sector \nNational  Program  Document  (1994),  Bangladesh  National  Habitat  II  Report  (1996),  and \n\nNational Policies for the Urban Sector \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB and World Bank. 2002.

Based  on \n\nBangladesh National Habitat II Istanbul +5 Report (2001) have all underscored the importance \nof  proper  urbanization  in  national  development.  The  Urban  Management  Policy  Statements \n(1994 and 1999) prepared by the LGD emphasized that all pourashavas should have adequate \npersonnel and financial strength, provide and maintain basic infrastructure facilities, prepare and \nimplement land-use plans, address poverty, ensure participation, and involve the private sector. \nThese policy statements, however, were never approved by the Government.  \n \n13.  With the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),8 the committee for urban local \ngovernments  was  formed  to  examine  national  policy  issues  including  amendments  to  the \nthe \nPourashava  Ordinance \nrecommendations of the committee, a new Pourashava Ordinance (2008) was approved on 14 \nMarch 2008 by the Government. The new ordinance redefines urban areas; constitutes standing \ncommittees; and enhances citizens\u2019 participation through committees with representatives from \nprofessional  groups,  citizens  groups,  and  the  urban  poor.  The  recommendations  were \nformulated  based  on  experiences  in  governance  reform  under  the  Urban  Governance  and \nInfrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (UGIIP-1).  For  example,  under  UGIIP-1,  each \npourashava  formed  committees  representing  broad  citizens\u2019  groups,  namely  the  town-level \ncoordination  committee  (TLCC)  and  ward-level  coordination  committees  (WLCCs).  The  TLCC \nand WLCCs are forums to discuss various issues of pourashava management and ensure the \nparticipation of diverse social strata in decision making. The new Pourashava Ordinance (2008) \nhas made committees with citizen representatives a statutory requirement for pourashavas.9 \n \n14. \nThe  Government  approved  on  12  March  2008  an  ordinance  to  establish  the  Local \nGovernment Commission as the first permanent institution to oversee the policy development of \nlocal  governments.  The  Local  Government  Commission  is  expected  to  review  and  finalize  the \nUrban Sector Policy. \n \n15. \nThe  committee  for  urban  local  governments  developed  a  draft  Urban  Sector  Policy, \nwhich is yet to be approved.  The Government prioritized the approval of the new ordinance for \npourashavas  and  city  corporations  to  prepare  for  local  government  elections.  The  draft  policy \ntakes  a  comprehensive  approach  to  addressing  urban  issues,  recognizing  the  importance  of \ncapacity development and good governance in municipalities. While the approval of the Urban \nSector  Policy  improves  the  environment  for  pourashava  governance,  the  Second  Urban \nGovernance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (the  Project),  in  particular \ngovernance  reform  under  Urban  Governance  Improvement  Action  Program  (UGIAP),  can  be \nwell implemented even without the national policy, as evidenced by UGIIP-1. \n \nThe Government has been gradually formulating a nationwide institutional framework for \n16. \nurban  development  by  consolidating  initiatives  supported  by  various  projects.  The  Local \nGovernment  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  is  strengthening  its  urban  management  wing  by \nappointing a senior engineer dedicated to urban development. The Urban Management Support \nUnit (UMSU) was created in LGED by consolidating capacity-development programs supported \nby various projects. A municipal performance review committee (MPRC) was also established to \nreview  and  monitor  the  performance  of  pourashavas.  The  MPRC,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nLGD, covers all pourashavas supported by different projects, and UMSU supports the MPRC as \nits secretariat. \n\n                                                 \n8  The technical assistance for Supporting Urban Governance Reform, approved on 28 November 2002 is attached to \nADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project. \nManila.  \n\n9  The  new  ordinance  requires  pourashavas  to  establish  a  committee  with  50  members  at  most  to  cover  the  whole \npourashava and a committee with 10 members at most in each ward. These are equivalent to TLCCs and WLCCs. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         Appendix 3 \n\n27\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR  \n(1996\u20132008) \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nImplementation \nPeriod \n \n\n \n\nName of Project \n\nA.

Participatory planning was not always \nstrong for the first allocation of funds.  \nRelatively large and competent pourashavas entered the \nprogram and receive funds. \nUGIAP \nPourashavas were not familiar with the UGIAP in the initial \nphase of the project, causing delays in implementation.  \n\nPourashavas tended to focus on activities, rather than on \nthe resulting governance improvement through those \nactivities. \nSome mayors influenced the selection of representatives in \nthe TLCC and WLCCs, particularly for low-income groups.  \nThe involvement and support of the pourashava mayor \nwas critical for smooth and effective implementation.  \n\nThere was no mechanism to keep pourashavas from \nborrowing excessively. \nThe lengthy budgetary process slowed the implementation \nof the poverty reduction and gender action plans (PRAPs \nand GAPs).  \nImplementation Arrangement for Staffing \nThe early establishment of the project management office \n(PMO) and project implementation units (PIU) was \nessential for the smooth launch of the project. \n\nRecruiting key staff in pourashavas, in particular urban \nplanners, was critical for effectively implementing the \nproject. \nThe arrangement of having UGIAP facilitators covering \nmultiple pourashavas did not work well because mayors \ntried to hold facilitators in their own town and transport was \nnot readily available.  \nStaff trained under the project moved out of the \npourashavas, undermining continuity and momentum. \nPhysical works \nThe slow fielding of consultants delayed project \nimplementation. \nInterventions in slum areas were limited. \n\nRequiring an O&M budget as a fixed share of total budget \ndid not always match actual requirements. \nIn some cases, roads were designed without adequate \nattention to drainage. \n\nThe Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement \n(Sector) Project (the Project) keeps the performance-based \nallocation of investment funds as a major feature of its design.  \nProgress of reform will be monitored more intensively, on a \nquarterly basis, throughout the Project.   \nGovernance improvement and infrastructure development will be \nplanned and implemented in a more integrated manner through the \ndevelopment of PDPs. \nEven for the first allocation of funds, all pourashavas need to meet \nthe minimum criteria of governance improvement, including \nparticipatory planning through the formulation of a PDP.  \n\nSix class C pourashavas are included in the Project on pilot basis. \n\n \n\nThe UGIAP will be explained to target pourashavas well in \nadvance of the Project.  Detail task lists and guidelines to \nimplement the UGIAP will be developed before the Project starts. \nThe Project introduces the citizen report card to examine citizens\u2019 \nperception of governance improvement.  \n\nThe representative for low-income groups will be nominated \namong themselves and include leaders of SICs and CBOs.  \nThe Project will seek the support of mayors from an early stage \nand provide specific programs for their capacity development and \nfamiliarization with the UGIAP. \nThe UGIAP includes debt indicators and a requirement of full \nrepayment of debts due. \nPRAPs and GAPs will indentify clear budget requirements to be \nincluded in the PDP. \n\nThe coordinator of project preparatory technical assistance is \ndesignated as project director before the Project starts and is \nworking full time. Target pourashavas will be informed on the \nrequirement of a PIU well in advance of the Project.   \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) engaged in discussions with the \nministry concerned regarding prompt recruitment. The recruitment \nof staff is included in the assurances of ADB loan agreement. \nUnder the Project, UGIAP facilitators will be kept in one pourashava \nrather than cover multiple pourashavas. The types of facilitators will \nbe reduced to limit total inputs. \n\nThe Project has explicit assurances in the ADB loan agreement \nabout keeping the trained staff in project areas.   \n\nAdvance action was approved and the core staffers of the PMO \nwere assigned to procuring the consultant. \nAll pourashavas will spend at least 5% of the allocated funds on \nbasic services in urban slums. \nThe UGIAP will require the formulation of O&M plan and budgets \ndetermined on the basis of the plan. \nFor road subprojects, more attention will be paid to drainage design. \nThe development of a master plan will be required for drainage \nprojects. \n\nCBO  =  community-based  organization,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  PDP  =  pourashava  development  plan,  PMO  =  project \nmanagement  office,  SIC  =  slum  improvement  committee,  TLCC  =  town  level  coordination  committee,  UGIAP  =  Urban  Governance \nImprovement Action Program, WLCC = ward level coordination committee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n29\n\nCRITERIA FOR SUBPROJECT SELECTION \n\n \nA. \n1. \nGovernance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (the Project):  \n\nEligible Subprojects \nThe following types of subprojects will be eligible for financing under the Second Urban \n\n(i)  Municipal  transport.

The  maximum  amount  of  funds  to  be  allocated  to  each  pourashava \n(the  investment  ceiling)  is  Tk250  million  for  class  A  pourahsavas,  Tk200  million  for  class  B \npourahsavas, and Tk100 million for class C pourahsavas. The investment ceiling does not include \nin-kind contributions by pourashavas and beneficiaries. \n \nFinancing  Pattern.  Civil  works  and  equipment  for  revenue-generating  subprojects, \n2. \nincluding water supply, bus terminals, and truck terminals, will be financed 50% by grant and 50% \nby loan for class A pourashava and 70% by grant and 30% by loan for class B pourashava. The \nloan  will  have  an  interest  rate  of  4%  for  20  years,  including  a  5-year  grace  period,  and  will  be \ndenominated in the local currency. All other types of subprojects will be funded 100% by grant. \n \n3. \nEntry to Phase 2. Pourashavas that successfully achieve all performance criteria of phase \n1 of the Urban Governance Improvement Action Program (UGIAP) will proceed to phase 2 and be \nentitled to utilize a maximum of 50% of the investment ceiling. While the expected average period \nof phase 1 is 1.5 years, pourashavas can enter into phase 2 immediately after the compliance of all \nphase  1  performance  criteria.  The  assessment  of  pourashavas\u2019  performance  by  the  municipal \nperformance review committee (MPRC) will be carried out semiannually. Pourashavas that do not \nmeet any of the phase 1 performance criteria within 2 years from the beginning of phase 1 will lose \nall entitlement for fund allocation. \n \n4. \nEntry  to  Phase  3.  At  the  end  of  phase  2,  which  is  expected  to  be  in  June  2012, \npourashavas\u2019  performance  will  be rated  by  the  MPRC.  The  rating  will  be  \u201cfully  satisfactory\u201d  if  the \npourashava meets all of the phase 2 performance criteria of the UGIAP to a fully satisfactory level, \n\u201csatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava meets all of the minimum requirements of the phase 2 performance \ncriteria, or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava does not meet all of the minimum requirements. The \nadditional  entitlement  in  phase  3  is  50%  of  the  investment  ceiling  for  pourashavas  with  a  fully \nsatisfactory  rating,  25%  of  the  investment  ceiling  for  pourashavas  with  a  satisfactory  rating,  and \nnothing for pourashavas with an unsatisfactory rating.   \n \n5. \nNew Entry. Within 1 year after the end of phase 1, all class A and B pourashavas that are \nnot included under the Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project \n(the Project) will be informed and encouraged to implement the UGIAP. The MPRC will rank those \npourashsavas  that  apply  for  fund  allocations  under  the  Project  according  to  the  performance \ncriteria of the UGIAP. Pourashavas with a high ranking will be entitled to utilize a maximum of 50% \nof  their  investment  ceiling.  In  the  middle  of  phase  2,  the overall  fund  utilization will  be  assessed, \nand the candidate pourashavas will be identified. At the end of phase 2, the new pourashavas will \nbe determined by the interministerial steering committee subject to fund availability. \n \nB. \n\nUrban Governance Improvement Action Program  \n\nTable A6.1: Phase 1 Performance Criteria \n\nActivities \n1.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nPoverty  incidence  in  urban  areas  of  Bangladesh  is  currently  estimated  at  32.6%  (Poverty  Monitoring  Survey,  2004).  With  a \npopulation growth rate of almost 6%, or three times the national average, expanding urban areas have a growing number of \nurban  poor.  Urban  poverty  is  associated  with  poor-quality  housing,  often  in  overcrowded,  unsanitary  slum  settlements.  The \nurban  poor  have  limited  access  to  urban  services  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  flood  protection,  local  roads, \npublic transport, street lighting, etc.  \n\nThe proposed Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (the Project) is closely linked to the \nNational Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (2005),  which recognizes that growing disparities in living standards in \nthe  cities  is  emerging  as  an  important  policy  concern.  Unplanned  city  growth,  illegal  encroachments  on  public  land,  poor \nurban governance, and a lack of policy attention to the needs of the informal sector are some of the key factors identified in \nthe  strategy  as  exacerbating  the  problem  of  urban  poverty.  According  to  the  strategy,  critical  policy  entry  points  include \nmitigating public health risks by improving access to water, sanitation, and adequate solid waste management; addressing the \nservice needs of both transient settlements  and more stable poor neighborhoods; strong and effective policy support to the \ninformal sector; and better utilization of public urban land for community purposes and the needs of the poor. The proposed \nProject has been designed to address these issues in particular by focusing on support to low-income areas, including slum \nareas,  in  terms  of  improved  access  to  basic  urban  services.  The  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  empower  poor  people, \nensuring  that  they  have  access  to  the  urban  decision-making  process  and  can  be  involved  in  planning,  implementing,  and \nmonitoring urban infrastructure in their communities.  \n\nThe project focuses on ADB\u2019s continuing role in providing support for social development. It aims to facilitate access for the \npoor,  women,  and  excluded  groups;  improve  infrastructure  in  urban  slums;  and  improve  the  delivery  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation services in a financially sustainable manner in urban areas. Furthermore, the country strategy and program focuses \non  good  governance  through  support  for  improved  local  governance;  decentralizing  and  strengthening  local  government; \nimproving  local  resource  mobilization,  planning,  and  management  capacity;  and  supporting  the  involvement  of  communities \nand the private sector in planning and delivering local services.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n\nBangladesh  has  a  total  area  of  147,000  square  kilometers  and  a  population  of  140  million.  At  950  people  per  square \nkilometer, it has one of the world\u2019s highest population densities. The country is vulnerable to a variety of natural disasters that \nbring  hardship  to  its  people,  nearly  42%  of  whom  live  below  the  poverty  line.  In  the  past  3  decades,  Bangladesh  has \nexperienced high urban population growth at 2.5% per annum, owing to rural landlessness, employment opportunities in the \ncities,  and  the  stagnating  economy  in  the  countryside.  About  35  million  people  live  in  the  country\u2019s  six  cities,  308 \npourashavas, and 208 smaller urban settlements.  Safe drinking water is inaccessible to 6 million urban people; 40% of urban \nhouseholds  resort  to  open  defecation  or  use  unsanitary  hanging  latrines;  and  only  25%  of  the  urban  households  live  in \npermanent  structures.  Local  governments  are  responsible  for  addressing  these  issues,  but  lack  of  capacity,  constrained \nfinancial  resources  due  to  poor  tax  collection,  and  the  lack  of  institutional  incentives  or  accountability  to  citizens  prevent \nimprovement.  Meanwhile,  the  continuing  rise  in  urban  population  means  that,  by  2015,  an  estimated  51  million  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  projected  population  of  167  million  will  live  in  urban  areas.  This  poses  considerable  demand  for  housing, \ninfrastructure, and social services in pourashavas.   \n\nIn  Bhanga,  Rangpur,  and  Cox\u2019s  Bazar,  half  of  the  people  living  in  slum  settlements  are  extremely  poor.  More  than  half  are \nfunctionally illiterate, and the main occupations are day labor and small trade. Around 35% of the slum dwellers do not have \nelectricity,  and  almost  32%  do  not  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Sanitation  facilities  and  solid  waste  collection  are \ninadequate.  In  Rangpur,  the  sanitation  situation  is  very  poor,  with  no  solid  waste  collection.  Unsafe  water  and  unhygienic \nconditions contribute to a high prevalence of waterborne diseases, with the poor, women, and children most at risk. High rates \nof morbidity and mortality derive from the use of shallow hand-pumped tube wells, which can be contaminated with arsenic; \nopen  wells  and  ponds,  which  can  be  contaminated  with  arsenic  and  bacteria.  In  the  three  pourashavas,  the  most  common \ndiseases are diarrhea, dysentery, parastic worms, and skin disorders.   \n\n \nThe proposed Project targets the poor in particular in terms of improving access to urban infrastructure and services, including \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nimproved  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities;  the  construction  of  drainage  facilities;  and  the  establishment  of  solid  waste \nmanagement systems. A poverty reduction action plan  will be prepared, outlining the infrastructure to be supported and the \nneeded capacity development. The proposed Project  will empower poor groups by ensuring that they are involved in urban \ndecision-making  processes  and  participate  in  town  and  ward  coordination  committees.  The  urban  poor  will  be  involved  in \nplanning and prioritizing urban infrastructure in pourashavas through the preparation of pourashava  development plans. The \nProject  will  indirectly  support  the  urban  poor  by  building  the  capacity  of  pourashavas  to  conduct  pro-poor  planning  and  by \ncreating employment opportunities for the poor.       \n\n \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nHousehold surveys conducted during the preparation of the proposed Project reveal that the numbers of slums and clusters of \npoor people is significant in all three pourashavas covered. Housing conditions in slums and cluster areas are very poor, and \naccess to services is limited. None of the slum dwellers has access to piped water. The main problems related to access to \nwater, as reported by slum dwellers, are long distances to water points, inadequate supply, and poor quality. In spite of the \npoor  quality,  the  vast  majority  of  slum  dwellers  do  not  treat  drinking  water,  and  this  increases  the  incidence  of  waterborne \ndiseases  in  these  areas.  Though  most  of  the  slum  dwellers  reported  that  they  have  access  to  latrines,  most  of  them  are \nhanging latrines, which do not provide sanitary conditions. More than half of slum areas in Cox\u2019s Bazar do not have covered \ndrains, creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The drains are rarely cleaned, which results in blockage and overflow. All \nrespondents reported that no garbage bins or solid waste management system exist. Many are forced to bury their garbage or \ndump it on streets or into drains or rivers.  \n \nThe main occupations of poor men are rickshaw pulling, fishing, and day labor. Most women are engaged in domestic work. \nThe rate of illiteracy in high among adults. School attendance is as low as 30% in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where the dropout rate before \ncompleting primary school is as high as 90%. The reasons for the high dropout rate are the long distance to school, especially \nfor slum dwellers, and low family income, which requires children to start work at an early age. As there are no health services \nin  or  near  the  slum  areas,  child  birth  routinely  takes  place  in  the  home,  creating  risks  to  mothers  and  newborns.  Female-\nheaded households account for 10% of all households in Cox\u2019s Bazar. The household survey included citizens\u2019 perception of \nthe  services  provided  by  the  pourashavas.  Almost  all  of  them  were  dissatisfied,  and  they  emphasized  that  they  were  not \ninvolved  in  decision-making  regarding  urban  services.  Little  or  no  communication  exists  between  pourashava  officials  and \ncitizens regarding poor service delivery.  \n \nMost  roads  in  slum  areas  are  extremely  poor,  with  no  cleaning  or  maintenance.  The  poor  road  conditions  cause  problems \ngetting patients to the health center and more general problems during natural disasters and the rainy season.   \n \nIn  Bhanga,  one  of  the  pourashavas  to  be  included  in  the  proposed  Project  has  no  slum,  but  it  does  have  clusters  of  poor \npeople. Most of the people living in these clusters do no have access to piped water, 83% of poor people do not have their \nown  latrines,  and  17%  use  open  space  for  defecation.  There  is  no  door-to-door  collection  of  solid  waste,  and  almost  all \nrespondents  reported  that  streets  were  not  swept  daily.  Half  of  the  poor  people  are  functionally  illiterate.  Their  main \noccupations are small trading or day labor. In the cluster areas, 35% do not have electricity.   \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nWorkshops  were  held  in  three  pourashavas  as  part  the  Project  mission-visioning  activities  for  preparing  pourashava   \ndevelopment plans (PDPs). Consultations were carried out on 1 November 2007 in Bhanga, 6 November 2007 in Cox Bazar, \nand  9  November  2007  in  Rangpur.  The  workshops  were  attended  by  elected  and  appointed  officials  of  the  pourashavas, \ncommunity-based  organizations,  businessmen,  women,  and  poor  urban  residents.  During  the  workshops,  the  stakeholders \nidentified slum areas in their respective pourashavas, the main issues in regard to basic urban services, and priority areas for \nsubprojects to be financed under the Project. Subsequent public consultations were carried out on 25 November in Bhanga, \n17  December  in  Cox\u2019s  Bazar,  and  27  December  in  Rangpur  to  confirm  the  proposed  subprojects.  The  involvement  of \nstakeholders in identifying the main issues and priority areas for improved urban services has created strong ownership of the \nProject among all groups. \n\n \n\n\f       Appendix 12      45 \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation     \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n   The  preparation  of  the  PDP  is  participatory.  The  PDP  is  a  town-wide  plan  prepared  by  the  pourashavas  to  identify \ndevelopment  priorities  supported  by  technical  and  financial  feasibility  studies.  The  PDP  has  both  a  long-term  vision  and  a \nshort- to medium-term development plan.   \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nPrimary and secondary data have been analyzed to assess the status of women in the three pourashavas. Socially prescribed \nroles limit women\u2019s access to economic resources such as capital, skills, and marketing know-how. These same social norms \nlimit  women\u2019s  participation  in  political  and  other  forms  of  decision  making  that  affect  their  lives.  Gender  disparities  are  still \nmarked  in  many  aspects  of  the  labor  market.  The  gap  in  wage  rates  between  men  and  women  is  significant.  Women\u2019s \nemployment  is  concentrated  in  sectors  with  low  returns  on  labor  and  is  often  temporary.  Key  social  development  indicators \ndemonstrate gaps between male and female members of the same household. Maternal mortality rates remain high, and food \nconsumption patterns that favor boys create gender gaps in malnutrition.  \n \nThe survey conducted during the preparation of the proposed Project shows that the average annual income of households \nheaded by women is 70% less than of households headed by men. Female illiteracy is 5 percentage points higher than male \nilliteracy.  Parallel  to  this  disparity,  access  to  piped  water  supply  and  sanitary  latrines  is  lower  among  female-headed \nhouseholds. Drinking water is largely sourced from hand-pumped tube wells, open wells, and ponds, putting female-headed \nhouseholds  at  higher  risk  of  arsenic  contamination  and  other  waterborne  diseases.  Moreover,  household  and  community \nwater collection and  water and sanitation management are traditionally  female roles. Thus,  women are vulnerable to health \nrisks from deficiencies in  water, hygiene, and sanitation in  the households and the community. Their access to latrines and \nsanitation facilities is often reduced by gender insensitivity in their construction and management.  \n \nThough  the  law  provides  25%  quotas  for  women\u2019s  election  into  local  governments,  women\u2019s  participation  and  decision-\nmaking roles in community, ward, and pourashava affairs are very limited.   \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nA  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared.  The  gender  action  plan  includes  the  following  strategies  to  ensure  that  women \nbenefit  from  the  proposed  Project,  and  that  they  are  empowered  to  participate  in  urban  decision-making  processes:  (i)  the \nformation of pourashava gender committees providing guidance on how to mainstream gender aspects in urban development \nplans  and  of  community-based  organizations  with  extensive  involvement  of  women;  (ii)  equal  representation  of  women  in \nsector  working  groups;  (iii)  the  design  of  gender  sensitization  programs  for  pourashava  staff;  (iv)  the  development  of  clear \nterms  of  reference  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  female  ward  commissioners;a  and  (v)  the  provision  of  training  as \nneeded. The Project will develop disaggregated indicators monitoring implementation. Contractors will be required to ensure \nequal pay for men and women. Women will be trained in operating and maintaining community infrastructure.   \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n \nIssue \n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \n Limited impact  \n\n \n\n   Full Resettlement Plan \n   Short Resettlement Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\nThe subprojects are not anticipated to result in \nsignificant land acquisition or resettlement.

The  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  basic  urban \ninfrastructure and service delivery (water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, drainage, \nmunicipal  transport  and  communications,  municipal  facilities,  and  basic  urban  services  to  the \nurban  poor),  (ii)  governance  improvement  and  capacity  development,  and  (iii)  project \nmanagement and implementation support. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for sample \nsubprojects1 and a sector IEE were prepared (Supplementary Appendixes K and L). The IEEs \nwere  based  on  a  review  of  investment  proposals;  field  visits,  secondary  data,  and  geographic \ninformation system imagery to characterize the environment and identify potential impacts; and \ninterviews  and  discussions  with  stakeholders.  Salient  points  from  the  IEEs  are  summarized \nbelow. \n \nBangladesh  has  a  subtropical  monsoon  climate  characterized  by  wide  seasonal \n2. \nvariations  in  rainfall,  moderately  warm  temperatures,  and  high  humidity.  There  are  about  700 \nrivers, groundwater is abundant, and aquifers are highly productive. Alluvial soils of varying but \nrelatively  young  age,  dating  from  the  Holocene  and  Pleistocene,  predominate  throughout  the \ncountry.  Bangladesh  falls  within  the  tropical  and  subtropical  moist  forest  biome  of  the  Indo-\nMalayan  bio-geographic  realm.  Wetlands  throughout  the  country  are  a  great  source  of \nbiodiversity  for  Bangladesh.  Both  marine  and  freshwater  artisanal  fisheries  are  prominent. \nBangladesh is ethnically homogeneous, with the Bengali ethnic and linguistic group comprising \n98%  of  the  population.  The  current  population  is  between  150  and  160  million,  and  the \npopulation  growth  rate  is  2.1%,  having  slowed  from  around  6%  in  the  1960s.  The  United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific reports strong growth in the \neconomy,  sustained  by  buoyant  private  consumption  and  continual  increase  in  private \ninvestment. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe Project is designed to maximize environmental and public health benefits. Benefits \nare  positive  and  large,  with  infrastructure  subprojects  (i)  improving  the  environment  in \npourashavas  by  reducing  residents\u2019  exposure  to  pollutants  through  improved  water  supply \nsanitation, solid waste management, drainage, and municipal transport; (ii) improving aesthetics \nwith  better  drainage  and  solid  waste  management;  and  (iii)  and  reducing  flooding  through \ndrainage  improvement.  Other  social  benefits  will  derive  from  subprojects  for  the  urban  poor, \nimplemented  using  an  integrated  approach,  that  provide  such  basic  urban  services  as \ncommunity water supply and sanitation. The Project will improve biological systems that rely on \nhealthy  aquatic  environments  through  improved  protection  of  surface  water  and  groundwater \nquality. \n \nThe Project provides a significant mechanism for enhancing the environment. Potential \n4. \nadverse  environmental  impacts  are  primarily  associated  with  unrealized  benefits,  which  may \noccur due to failures in implementing the Project in accordance with good engineering practice. \nAnother  potential  negative \nfollow \nenvironmental  subproject  selection  guidelines  may  adversely  affect  surrounding  communities, \nthough  with  limited  intensity  and  short  duration.  Some  potential  adverse  impacts  have  been \nidentified with regard to the serviceability of infrastructure during operation. All identified adverse \nimpacts  can  be  mitigated.  Measures  include  properly  locating,  planning,  and  designing \nproposed  subprojects;  controlling  construction  activity;  and  properly  maintaining  systems \nfollowing commissioning. No irreversible environmental impacts are associated with the Project. \n\nEnvironmental Impact Forecasting and Mitigation \n\nto  construction,  where \n\nis  related \n\nimpact \n\nfailure \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n1  The  sample  subprojects  are  for  a  bus  terminal,  roads  improvement,  and  water  supply  in  Bhanga;  road \nimprovement in Cox\u2019s Bazar; and drainage, solid waste management, and water supply and sanitation in Rangpur. \n\n \n\n\f       Appendix 14      49 \n\n \nThe  analysis  indicates  that  likely  negative  impacts  are  insignificant  in  terms  of  overall \n5. \nimpacts and the absolute amount of resources affected; that amount relative to existing stocks \nof resources; the intensity, timing and duration of works; and the probability of negative impacts, \nif environmental subproject selection guidelines are complied with and mitigation measures are \nincorporated in project development.

Evaluation  of  cumulative,  regional,  and  long-term  impact \nscenarios show that such impacts are unlikely to occur. The principal cumulative, regional, and \nlong-term  impact  is  expected  to  be  beneficial:  the  overall  improvement  of  social,  public  sector \ninfrastructure in pourashavas. This is best assessed through project monitoring and evaluation. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  is  the  Executing  Agency.  A \nproject management office (PMO) will be established within LGED. The PMO\u2019s responsibilities \ninclude  ensuring  the  implementation  of  IEEs  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure  (EARP).  Project  implementing  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  each  pourashava. \nThe  PIUs  will  oversee  environmental  concerns  related  to  subproject  implementation,  and  their \nresponsibilities include preparing and updating IEEs consistent with the EARP.  \n \n8. \nDesign, supervision, and management (DMS) consultants will be recruited by the PMO \nto  provide  assistance  to  the  PMO  and  PIUs.  The  DMS  consultants  include  an  international \nenvironment  specialist  (IES)  and  a  national  environment  specialist  (NES)  based  in  the  PMO. \nThere will also be six regional environment specialists (RESs).2 The IES and NES will provide \ntechnical support to the Environmental and Social Unit (ESU), including reviewing and updating \nthe  EARP  and  guidelines  for  specific  types  of  subprojects  and  assisting  in  preparing  terms  of \nreference  for  environmental  assessment.  The  RESs  will  support  environmental  management \nfunctions  including  updating  subproject  IEEs  in  respect  to  environmental  management  plans, \nassisting  in  preparing  IEEs,  and  assisting  in  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures \nassociated with subprojects.  \n \n9. \nEnvironmental review of subprojects will  consist of screening in the pourashava by  the \nPIU and the preparation of the IEE through the RESs. The DMS consultant will assist PIUs in \nsubproject preparation and implementation. Review will be conducted at the divisional level of \nthe Department of Environment, in conjunction with a review panel set up by the pourashavas. \nThis  will  involve  the  formation  of  a  committee  made  up  of  the  pourashava  chairman  (as \ncommittee  chairman),  the  project  director,  a  deputy  director  of  Department  of  Environment \nserving as a divisional director, and other appointees from relevant district offices. The PIU will, \nworking  with  the  RESs,  assist  in  preparing  the  IEE  and  environmental  impact  assessment, \ncapacity  building  and  training,  preparing  guidelines  and  procedures,  and  subproject-specific \nguidance. Environmental monitoring will be undertaken by the PIU supported by the RESs, IES, \nand NES. \n \n10. \nThe RESs will be required to include mitigation measures in designs, where appropriate, \nand  to  specify  other  measures  in  construction  contracts.  Contractors  will  be  required  by  their \ncontracts to implement all specified mitigation, monitoring, and reporting obligations to them in \nsubproject IEEs.  \n \nD. \n \ntakes  a  participatory  approach  with  parallel  activities:  stakeholder \n11. \nconsultations,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  initiation  of  pourashava  development  plans  by \nmeans  of  open,  facilitated  sessions  for  ward  and  pourashava  visioning  or  planning.  A  wide \nrange  of  stakeholders  have  had  the  opportunity  to  make  substantive  contributions  concerning \nexisting conditions and preferences. Within a given community, about 1,200 people have been \nexposed to the concept of the Project by their direct involvement, and through citizen\u2019s groups \nand ward committees. \n \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nThe  Project \n\n                                                 \n2  Environment specialists  will have tasks in capacity building  that are included in their terms of reference,  which is \nattached  to  the  EARP  as  an  appendix.  Capacity  building  will  take  various  forms,  including  formal  training  in \nenvironmental  assessment  procedures  and  methodology,  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  environmental \nmanagement plans, and on-the job training directly related to implementing subprojects during the loan period. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nEnvironmental Selection Guidelines and Environmental Review Framework \n\n12. \nPublic consultations on environmental safeguards were held in each of the pourashavas \nfor phase 1 of the Project.3 A project brief was prepared for each pourashava that provided an \noverview  of  potential  environmental  impacts  and  explained  proposed  mitigation  measures. \nParticipants came from the communities directly affected by the subprojects, members of ward \ncommittees, representatives of local nongovernment organizations, and representatives of local \ngovernment  agencies.  No  significant  issues  were  raised  during  public  consultations  that  have \nnot been addressed in the IEEs, nor were there issues that pose a significant constraint in the \nimplementation of proposed subprojects. A proposal has been described in IEEs for continuing \nthe process of public consultation during construction that includes a mechanism for redress of \ngrievances  that  arise  then.  All  IEEs  and  other  relevant  documents  will  be  made  available  at \npublic locations in the towns and will be disclosed to a wider audience via the ADB website.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  guidelines  and  requirements  of  the \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  environmental  subproject \nselection guidelines and an EARP have been developed to guide the implementation of future \nsubprojects.  The  EARP  details  the  (i)  government  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures,  (ii) responsibilities  and  authorities  involved  in  environmental  assessment  and \nreview,  (iii) compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines,  (iv)  staffing  requirements  and \nbudgets,  and  (v)  subproject  environmental  selection  guidelines.  It  also  documents  procedures \nfor  the  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects,  including  categorization,  the  preparation  of \nenvironmental  assessment, \nfor  environmental  management  plans,  and \nprocedures for public consultation. The section specifies that, should a subproject unexpectedly \nbe  classified  as  A,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required.  Public  disclosure \nrequirements for category A, including the 120-day requirement, are in the EARP. \n \nF. \n \n14. \nThe  IEEs  show  that  the  sample  subprojects  will  bring  large  net  environmental  benefits \nand  that  any  adverse  environmental  impact  can  be  addressed  through  properly  locating, \nplanning,  and  designing  proposed  subprojects;  controlling  construction  activity;  properly \nmaintaining  systems  following  their  commissioning;  and  other  mitigation  measures.  The \nprincipal  cumulative,  regional,  and  long-term  environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be \nbeneficial:  the  overall  improvement  of  social,  public  sector  infrastructure  in  the  urban \nenvironments  of  pourashavas.  Environmental  subproject  selection  guidelines  and  the  EARP \nhave  been  developed  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects  complies  with \nenvironmental guidelines and the requirements of the Government of Bangladesh and ADB.

Pourashavas  will  (i)  utilize  existing  lands  for  rehabilitating  existing  water  supply, \ndrainage, and municipal facilities, as well as for providing basic urban services to the urban poor; \n(ii) utilize vacant pourashava or community land and ensure community consensus in the siting of \npublic and community toilets and deep tube wells; (iii) align roads and bridges to avoid impacts on \nstructures; and (iv) utilize vacant pourashava land for solid waste management that will not pose \nhealth  hazards  to  settlements.  Impacts  are  to  be  further  minimized  through  careful  subproject \nsiting  and  alignment  during  detailed  subproject  design  and  implementation.  Short  resettlement \nplans were prepared for sample subprojects with resettlement impacts in two pourashavas.1 \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThis summary provides highlights of the resettlement framework. The framework outlines \nthe objectives, policy principles, and procedures for land acquisition (if required), compensation, \nand other assistance measures for affected people. It is based on the national law Acquisition and \nRequisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  (1982)  and  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  framework  provides  a  comparison  of  these \ndocuments and addresses gaps.  \n \n4. \n\nThe core principles of involuntary resettlement for the Project are as follows: \n(i) \n\nResettlement Framework and Policy \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe acquisition of land, in particular land under disputes over ownership, and the \nresettlement of people will be avoided as much as possible. \nLocal  stakeholders  will  be  systematically  informed  and  properly  consulted  to \nidentify  possible  alternative  subproject  engineering  and  operational  solutions  to \navoid or minimize the adverse impacts of land acquisition. Disclosure to the public \nregarding  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  the  eligibility  of  affected  people, \ncompensation, entitlements, and special assistance measures to vulnerable groups \nwill be undertaken. \nAll affected people will be properly identified and recorded in a census instrument, \nin  which  the  cut-off  date  for  their  eligibility  is  the  last  day  of  the  survey  in  the \nsubproject area, and will be notified in advance when land for the subproject will be \nacquired.  Lack  of  formal  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost  will  not  prevent  affected \npeople from receiving compensation, entitlement, and rehabilitation measures. \n\n(iv)  Where  resettlement  cannot  be  avoided,  relocation  site(s),  whether  permanent  or \ntemporary, should be free of environmental risks and with access to drinking water \nand  sanitation.  Social  services  and  all  other  services  accessible  in  the  previous \nlocation will be provided prior to relocation, in consultation with affected people and \ntheir hosts. \nRelocated affected people will be provided with assistance to maintain, or improve \ntheir  pre-subproject  living  standards,  income  earning  capacity,  and  production \nlevels. \n\n(v) \n\n                                                 \n1  The sample subprojects are for a bus terminal and road improvement in Bhanga Pourashava and road improvement \n\nin Cox\u2019s Bazar. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nSpecial  assistance  will  be  incorporated  into  the  resettlement  implementation \nprocess  to  protect  any  socially  or  economically  vulnerable  groups  that  are \naffected.2 \nAn  effective  mechanism  for  arbitration  of  complaints  and  grievances  will  be \nprovided during resettlement implementation. \nInstitutional  arrangements  and  human  resources  will  be  in  place  for  consultation, \nliaison, \nto  ensure  effective \nresettlement implementation prior to the commencement of the subproject. \nPayment  of  compensation  must  be  provided  prior  to  displacement,  and  other \nresettlement assistance must be initiated prior to award of civil works contracts.  \n\nland  acquisition,  resettlement  and  monitoring \n\nThe entitlement matrix for the Project, based on these, is given in Table A15.1 (see page \n57). \n\nProcedure for Preparing Resettlement Plans \n\n \n5. \nCompensation  for  the  loss  of  land,  structures,  assets,  trees,  and  crops  will  be  at \nreplacement  cost.  Independent  land  appraisers  will  determine  land  prices.  Structures  and  other \nassets  will  be  assessed  by  contracted  implementing  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nthrough a survey of construction materials. Trees and crops will be assessed by NGOs according \nto a survey of market prices and in consultation with agriculture and/or horticulture experts. NGOs \nwill  also  consult  with  affected  people  on  replacement  costs.  Vulnerable  households  will  be \nprovided additional assistance in the form of land-for-land replacement options, prioritized project \nemployment,  and  an  additional  allowance  for  land  and  structure  losses.  Income  losses  are \nanticipated  to  be  minimal  and  temporary.  Income  restoration  activities  include  the  provision  of \nshort-term allowances and restoration of access to livelihood activities. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nResettlement  plans  for subprojects will  be  prepared  in  the following  manner.  The project \nmanagement office (PMO) will, with guidance from the design, monitoring, and supervision (DMS) \nconsultant,  undertake  socioeconomic  surveys  for  each  subproject  based  on  its  preliminary \ntechnical design. If impacts are found to be significant, full resettlement plans will be prepared for \nthe subproject. 3 If impacts are insignificant, short resettlement plans will be required in subproject \npreparation.  Resettlement  plans  will  include  measures  to  ensure  that  socioeconomic  conditions, \nneeds,  and  the  priorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  does  not  disadvantage  vulnerable  groups.  DMS  will  have  one \ninternational  consultant and  seven national consultants  familiar  with  ADB  policy  and  procedures \nfor  the  preparation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans.  The  plans  will  comply  with  Government \npolices,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  other  social  safeguard  guidelines,  and  the \nresettlement framework. The resettlement plan for sample subprojects will be used as models for \nthe preparation and implementation of other subproject plans. Approval of subproject resettlement \nplans by ADB, and compensation prior to displacement, will be conditions for civil works contracts. \n \nAs  the  Executing  Agency,  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  will, \n7. \nthrough the PMO, ensure that the resettlement framework is closely followed when a resettlement \nplan is formulated for a subproject. LGED will further ensure that adequate resettlement budgets \nare  delivered  on  time  to  the  PMO  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  and  that  NGOs  are \ninvolved for timely implementation of resettlement plans. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nA  PMO  will  be  established  within  LGED.  The  PMO  responsibilities  include  ensuring  the \nimplementation  of  resettlement  framework  and  plans.  PIUs  will  be  established  In  each \npourashava and will oversee resettlement concerns related to subproject implementation, with its \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n2  These  can  include  ethnic  minorities,  indigenous  peoples,  households  headed  by  women  or  the  elderly,  and  people \n\nliving below the poverty line. \n\n3  Resettlement  is  significant  if  200  or  more  people  experience  major  \u201cimpacts,\u201d  defined  as  affected  people  being \n\nphysically displaced from housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n\n \n\n\f       Appendix 15      55 \n\nTwo  fulltime  staffers  will  be  recruited  in  the  PMO,  one  of  them  to  oversee  and  manage \n\nresponsibilities  including  the  preparation  and  updating  of  resettlement  plans  consistent  with  the \nresettlement framework.  \n \n9. \nsocial issues and social safeguards.  \n \n10. \nDMS consultants will be recruited by the PMO to provide assistance to the PMO and PIUs. \nThe  DMS  consultants  include  an  international  resettlement  specialist  (IRS)  and  a  national \nresettlement  specialist  (NRS)  based  in  the  PMO.  There  will  also  be  six  regional  resettlement \nspecialists  (RRSs).  The  IRS  and  NRS  will  provide  technical  support  to  the  Environmental  and \nSocial  Unit  (ESU),  including  the  review  and  updating  of  the  resettlement  framework  and \nguidelines  for  specific  types  of  subprojects,  and  assist  in  preparing  terms  of  reference  for \nresettlement  plan  preparation.  The  RRSs  will  support  resettlement  planning  functions,  including \nupdating subproject resettlement plans, assisting in preparing resettlement plans, and assisting in \nmonitoring subprojects.  \n \n11. \nResettlement  issues  will  be  coordinated  by  the  IRS  and  NRS,  who  will  ensure  that  all \nsubprojects comply with involuntary resettlement safeguards. The RRSs will work with the PIUs to \nupdate resettlement plans in the detailed design stage and to prepare resettlement plans for new \nsubprojects,  where  required  to  comply  with  Government  and  ADB  policies.  NGOs  will  be \nappointed  to  implement  resettlement  plans.

A  wide  range  of  stakeholders  had  the \nopportunity  to  make  substantive  contributions  concerning  existing  conditions  and  preferences. \nWithin a given community, about 1,200 people have been exposed to the concept of the Project \nby  their  direct  involvement  and  through  citizen\u2019s  groups  and  ward  committees.  Public \nconsultations  on  social  safeguards  were  held  in  each  of  the  pourashavas  for  phase  1  of  the \nProject.4 A project brief was prepared for each pourashava that provided an overview of potential \nresettlement impacts and explained proposed entitlement for affected people. Participants came \nfrom  the  communities  directly  affected  by  the  projects,  members  of  ward  committees, \nrepresentatives of local NGOs, and representatives of local government agencies. No significant \nissues were raised during public consultations that have not been addressed in the resettlement \nplans, nor were there issues that pose a significant constraint on the implementation of proposed \nsubprojects. A framework for consultations and community participation has been described in the \nresettlement framework for continuing the process during implementation. All resettlement plans \nand other relevant documents will be made available at public locations in the towns and will be \ndisclosed to a wider audience via the ADB website. \n \n13. \nGrievances  of  affected  people  will  first  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  implementing \nNGO  or  RRS.  Grievances  not  redressed  by  the  NGO  or  RRS  will  be  brought  to  the  grievance \nredress committee (GRC). Constituted for each ward, the GRC will comprise representatives from \nthe  PIU,  implementing  NGO,  office  of  the  chairman  of  the  pourashava,  affected  people,  and  a \nfemale  elected  member  of  the  Pourashava  council.  The  GRC  will  meet  every  month,  determine \nthe  merit  of  each  grievance,  and  resolve  grievances  within  15  days  of  receiving  the  complaint. \nThe  GRC  procedure  includes  an  appeals  procedure  for  the  affected  person,  who  can,  if  not \nsatisfied  with  the  GRC  decision,  attend  the  next  meeting  for  reconsideration.  Grievances  not \nredressed  by  the  GRC  will  be  addressed  by  the  project  steering  committee  or,  for  grievances \nrelated to land acquisition, by the Office of the District Commissioner. Further grievances will be \nreferred by affected people to the appropriate courts of law. Records will be kept of all grievances \nreceived,  including  the  contact  details  of  complainant,  date  that  the  complaint  was  received, \nnature of grievance, agreed corrective actions, date these were effected, and final outcome. \n \nF. \n \n14. \nResettlement  plan  implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  to  provide  the  PMO  with  an \neffective  basis  for  assessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying  potential  difficulties  and \nproblems.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  by  the  PMO  with  assistance  from  consultants. \nInternal monitoring will involve monitoring of indicators for (i) budget and time frame; (ii) delivery of \nentitlements;  (iii)  consultation,  grievance,  and  special  issues;  and  (iv)  benefit  monitoring.  An \nindependent external evaluator will monitor resettlement implementation.  \n \nG. \n \n15. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  detailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  for  each \nresettlement  plan,  for  inclusion  in  the  overall  subproject  estimate.  The  budget  will  include  (i) \ndetailed  costs  of  land  acquisition,  relocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  or \nimprovement; (ii) the source of funding; (iii) arrangements for approval; and (iv) the flow of funds \nand  contingency  arrangements.  Overall  costs  are  estimated  at  $1.5  million.  All  land  acquisition \nfunds will be provided by LGED. Land acquisition, compensation, relocation, and rehabilitation of \nincome and livelihood will be considered as an integral component of Project costs. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nResettlement Budget \n\n                                                 \n4  These were held on 25 November 2008 in Bhanga with 40 participants, 17 December 2007 at Cox\u2019s Bazar with 50 \nparticipants, and 30 December 2008 in Rangpur with 29 participants.
