An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (Supplementary \nAppendix  K)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  environmental \nassessment  of  subprojects  during  the  implementation  of  the \nInvestment Program. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  improve  the  urban \nfor  sustainable, \nenvironment  and  promote  ongoing  reforms \nefficient,  and  responsive  urban  service  delivery  in  15  initially \nidentified  ULBs  of  Rajasthan  with  economic  growth  and  tourism \npotential. The physical investments include improvements in water \nsupply, wastewater management, solid waste management, urban \ndrainage,  urban  transport  and  roads,  social  infrastructure,  and \ninfrastructure  support  for  cultural  heritage.  Coupled  with  the \nphysical  improvements  is  a  capacity  development  program  to \nenable  the  ULBs  to  implement  the  ongoing  urban  institutional, \nfinancial, and service delivery reforms.   \n \nThe  Government  of  India  has  requested  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  for  financing  for  the  Investment  Program  through  a \nmultitranche \nto \n$273 million  over  7  years,  will  finance  infrastructure  investments \nand  capacity  development  in  support  of  the  ongoing  urban \ninstitutional, financial, and service delivery reforms.  \n \n\nfacility.  The  Facility,  amounting \n\nfinancing \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Program \nInvestment Plan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nfrom  supporting \n\nUrban development for economic growth is a universal strategy of \nthe Government of India as its 10th Five-Year Plan [FYP], 2002\u2013\n2007,  and  11th  FYP,  2007\u20132012,  show.  The  strategy \nis \nspearheaded  by  such  urban  development  schemes  as  the \nJawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  and  its \nsubcomponent the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for \nSmall  and  Medium  Towns.  Apart \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s priority of planned development of urban centers in \nthe  country,  the  Investment  Program  is  also  aligned  with  the \nobjectives  of  fostering  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty  in \nRajasthan.  The  fast-growing  sectors  in  Rajasthan  are  mostly  in \nurban  areas,  where  productivity  is  3.5  times  higher  than  in  rural \nareas.  \n \nThe  emphasis  on  urban  development  in  Rajasthan,  financial \nreforms  and  the  passage  of  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment \nAct in 1992, which laid the basis for decentralization in the urban \nsector, have made some improvements, but large inefficiencies in \nservice  delivery,  low  investment  in  wider  service  coverage,  and \npoor maintenance persist. \n \nThe Investment Program and its road map are guided by the 10th \nFYP 2002\u20132007 and 11th FYP 2007\u20132012 of the Government of \nIndia. \nthe \nInvestment  Program,  Schedule  1)  The  Investment  Program  links \ncapital  investments  to  reforms  for  sustainable  impact.  It  targets \nmedium-size towns with economic growth and tourism potentials, \nwhile maintaining regional balance.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  increase  economic  growth,  reduce \npoverty, and sustain improvements in the urban environment and \nthe quality of life in the 15 initially identified ULBs in Rajasthan. It \nis expected to improve access to sustainable urban infrastructure \nand  services  for  1.6  million  people  in  the  Investment  Program \nULBs,  and  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  these  ULBs  to  manage \nurban services in a sustainable manner by the end of the Program \n(2014). \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  estimated  to  cost  $390  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $36.5 million.  \n \n\nthe  Framework  Financing  Agreement \n\n(See \n\nfor \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Rajasthan and other \n \n\nagencies \n\n \n\n \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n273.0 \n\n117.0 \n\n390.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShare  \n(%) \n\n70 \n\n30 \n\n100 \n\n\fFacility Amount and \nTerms  \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Investment \nProgram Completion \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency  \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nthe \n\nfinancing  period.  Moreover, \n\nA $273 million lending facility from the ordinary capital resources \nof  ADB  will  be  provided  to  the  Government  of  India.  The  final \nterms and conditions will be determined for each loan, according \nto the policies of ADB. Financing under each loan will be provided \nunder ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based facility. \nThe  Government  can  choose  a  currency  (from  among  eligible \ncurrencies)  and  an  interest  rate  regime  most  suitable  for  each \nloan.  ADB  also  provides  flexibility  in  repayment  and  interest \nrepayment \nswaps  during \nschedules that match the needs of each batch of subprojects with \ntheir cost recovery and sustainability profiles can be structured for \neach loan. \n \nThe Government of India will pass down the total loan amounts to \nthe  state  of  Rajasthan  on  the  same  terms  as  those  of  the  ADB \nloans.  \n \nDecember  2014  (the  last  periodic  financing  request  to  be \nsubmitted no later than by 2010). \n \nJune 2014. \n\n \nThe  state  government  of  Rajasthan  acting  through  its  Local  Self \nGovernment  Department  (LSGD)  under  the  Urban  Governance \nDepartment of Rajasthan. \n \nA  state-level  empowered  committee  will  monitor  the  use  of  the \nFacility.  The  LSGD  will  manage  the  Investment  Program  in  the \nULBs  through  an  investment  program  management  unit  (IPMU), \nwhich  will  (i)  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  Investment \nProgram,  (ii)  review  subprojects  submitted  by  ULBs  and  periodic \nfinancing  requests  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Economic \nAffairs,  (iii)  report  to  ADB  on  the  progress  of  the  Investment \nProgram,  and  (iv)  assist  the  ULBs  in  implementation.  The  IPMU \nwill  be  assisted  by  investment  program  management  consultants \n(IPMCs)  in  managing  the  Investment  Program  and  ensuring  the \ntechnical quality of design and construction.  \n \nFifteen  investment  program  implementation  units  (IPIUs)  will  be \nestablished  at  ULB  level,  and  a  full-time  IPIU  representative  will \nbe  appointed  in  each  Investment  Program  ULB.  The  IPIUs  will \ncarry  out  the  daily  implementation  activities  of  the  Investment \nProgram.  The  IPMU  and  IPIUs  will  be  assisted  by  design  and \nsupervision  consultants \nthe  design \ndocuments, managing the tendering of contracts, and supervising \nthe  construction  as  well  as  the  overall  management  of  the \nInvestment Program by the IPMCs.  \n \n\nin  preparing \n\n(DSCs) \n\n \n\n\fA  work  finalization  committee,  chaired  by  the  principal  secretary \nfor urban governance, will review the subproject appraisal reports \nand give its final endorsement before the reports are submitted to \nADB.  City-level  committees  under  the  various  district  collectors \nwill  review  the  activities  in  the  Investment  Program,  suggest \nimprovements, and guide the IPIUs in making the improvements.  \n \nAll  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  the  loans  under  the \nto  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nFacility  will  be  procured  according \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works \ncontracts  of  at  least  $10  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding;  all  other  such  contracts  will  be \nfar  as \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding.  As \nprocured \npracticable,  goods  will  be  procured  in  packages  of  more  than \n$1 million each to be suitable for international competitive bidding \nor  limited  international  bidding.  Minor  goods  costing  less  than \n$100,000  will  be  purchased  through  shopping.  The  feasibility  of \ncommunity  contracting  will  be  examined  on  a  case-to-case  basis \nfor  slum  upgrading  and  low-cost  sanitation  and  other  community \nworks valued at less than $100,000.  \n \nConsultants will be hired for the Investment Program according to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). A national consulting firm will be contracted to \nprovide IPMCs for 443 person-months and three national firms to \nprovide  DSCs \nthrough  ADB\u2019s \nfor  1,464  person-months, \nquality- and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  procedures  under  the \naforementioned guidelines.  \n \nThe Investment Program will benefit about 1.6 million people in 15 \ninitially  identified  ULBs  by  improving  the  urban  environment  and, \nhence,  the  health,  living  conditions,  and  productivity  of  the \nresidents.  Better  urban  infrastructure  and  services  will  lead  to \neconomic  benefits \nfrom  enhanced  productivity  and  urban \nefficiency for the participating ULBs, and will promote investments \nin  the  state.  The  interventions  will  benefit  the  poor.  Close  to \n200,000  slum  residents  will  benefit  directly  from  the  slum \nimprovement  subcomponent.  Improvements  in  other  town-wide \ninfrastructure, e.g., drainage, will also have a profound impact on \nthe poor, most of whom live on hazardous land prone to flooding. \nFurther,  the  Investment  Program  will  ensure  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment  by  supporting  urban \nreforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment  for  better  urban  governance  and  improved  service \ndelivery.  \n \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nto \n\nfinancial \n\ninstitutional  change  and \n\nThis is a low risk project. The effectiveness of the infrastructure to \nbe  developed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  depend  on  the \nlevel  of  ownership  and  commitment  shown  by  the  state  and  the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs.  The  state  and  the  ULBs  must  be \nreforms, \ncommitted \nparticularly  cost  recovery  and  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the \nassets  and  services.  There  must  be  sustained  political  will  to \nincrease  tariffs  and  impose  service  charges  or  property  taxes  in \norder to achieve cost recovery within a reasonable time. Another \ndownside  risk  is  that  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  do  not  have \nenough  revenues  to  properly  manage  and  maintain  the  existing \nand  newly  acquired  assets  and  may  be  forced  to  minimize  costs \nthrough inappropriate operations.  \n \nVarious measures designed into the Investment Program address \nthese  potential  risks.  Civic  awareness  programs  are  expected  to \nstimulate  demand  for  better  services  and  willingness  to  pay. \nIncentive  to  implement  ongoing  reforms  will  be  further  reinforced \nthrough  capacity  development  and  ADB\u2019s  continued  policy \ndialogue during the implementation of the Investment Program.  \n \nThe state government and the ULBs are committed to maximizing \nlocal \nrevenue  and  providing  an  adequate  operation  and \nmaintenance  budget  for  asset  sustainability.  The  government  is \nnow  preparing  a  transition  plan  for  urban  services  (from  its  line \nagencies  to  the  ULBs),  and  has  put  in  place  enhanced  revenue \naugmentation  measures  such  as \ninfrastructure  development \ntasks. The ULBs should thus be able to assume responsibility for \nurban  service  provision  in  a  phased  manner  as  the  assets  are \ntransferred  and  the  ULBs  gain  the  resources  and  revenues  to \nadequately manage them. \n   \n\n \n\n\fo\n72  00\u2019E\n\no\n77  00\u2019E\n\nINDIA\nRAJASTHAN\nURBAN SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\nPUNJAB\n\nHanumangarh\n\nHANUMANGARH\n\nP A K I S T A N\n\n28  00'No\n\nBIKANER\n\nBikaner\n\nRATANGARH\n\nRatangarh\n\nCHURU\n\nChuru\n\nNAWALGARH\n\nNawalgarh\n\nJAISALMER\n\nJaisalmer\n\nJODHPUR\n\nNagaur\n\nNAGAUR\n\no\n75  00'E\n\nHIMACHAL\nPRADESH\n\no\n85  00'E\n\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nPAKISTAN\n\nPUNJAB\n\nUTTARAKHAND\n\nHARYANA\n\nDELHI\n\nNEPAL\n\nJaipur\n\nR A J A S T H A N\n\nUTTAR\n PRADESH\n\no\n25  00'N\n\nSIKKIM\n\nBHUTAN\n\nARUNCHAL\nPRADESH\n\nA S S A M\n\nB I H A R\n\nJHARKHAND\n\nMEGHALAYA\no\n25  00'N\nBANGLADESH\nTRIPURA\n\nWEST\nBENGAL\n\nMIZORAM\n\nG U J A R A T\n\nM A D H Y A\nP R A D E S H\n\nGulf  of Cambay\n\nM A H A R A S H T R A\n\nCHHATTISGARH\n\nO R I S S A\n\nB a y  o f\n B e n g a l\n\nA N D H R A\nP R A D E S H\n\nGOA\n\n28  00'No\n\nA r a b i a n\nS e a\n\no\n10  00'N\n\nKARNATAKA\n\nTAMIL\n NADU\n\nKERALA\n\no\n10  00'N\n\nSRI LANKA\n\no\n75  00'E\n\no\n85  00'E\n\nBharatpur\n\nUTTAR  PRADESH\n\nBHARATPUR\n\nBari\n\nBARI\n\nAjmer\n\nAJMER\n\nMALPURA\nMalpura\n\nSAWAI\nMADHOPUR\n\nSawai Madhopur\n\nBarmer\n\nBARMER\n\nSIROHI\n\nSirohi\n\nABU\nAbu\n\nSHAHPURA\n\nShahpura\n\nKOTA\n\nKota\n\nNATHDWARA\n\nBHILWARA\n\nBhilwara\n\nJodhpur\n\nPali\n\nPALI\n\nUdaipur\n\n0\n\n100\n\nN\n\n50\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nState Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nAirport\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\n24  00'No\n\n0\n7\n-\n0\n8\n5\n4\n \nH\nR\n\nG  U  J  A  R  A  T\n\no\n72  00\u2019E\n\nUDAIPUR\n\nDungarpur\n\nDUNGARPUR\n\nRATLAM\n\nRatlam\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nState Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\n24  00'No\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nMADHYA   PRADESH\n\no\n77  00\u2019E\n\nHARYANA\n\nAlwar\n\nALWAR\n\nJAIPUR\n\nJaipur\n\nBaran\n\nBARAN\n\nJhalawar\n\nJHALAWAR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (the Facility) to India for the Rajasthan Urban Sector Development \nInvestment Program (the Investment Program).1  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\n2. \nRajasthan  is  India\u2019s  largest  state,  with  an  area  of  350,000  square  kilometers  and  a \npopulation  of  56.5  million  (2001  census).  The  Aravalli  mountain  range  runs  southwest  to \nnortheast  across  the  state,  dividing  it  into  two  distinct  geographical  regions\u2014the  Thar  Desert \ncovering more than 60% of the state, leaving Rajasthan acutely deficient in water supply, and \nthe fertile eastern region. The distribution of the state\u2019s urban centers is related to climate, water \nresources, and soil fertility, with the northeast region more sparsely populated than the eastern \nregion.  Rajasthan\u2019s  towns  and  cities  have  always  been  among  the  best  planned  in  India,  but \nrapid population growth over the last four decades has brought urban decline.  \n \n3. \nThe  state  has  an  urban  population of  around  13.2  million, 23.4%  of its  total  population \n(2001 census). Though lower than the national average of 27.8%, this proportion is expected to \nreach  26.1%  (22.8  million)  by  2021.  The  urban  population  grew  rapidly  in  the  1990s,  by  2.7% \nper  year,  because  of  high  natural  growth  rates  and  rural  migration.  Population  growth  is \nprojected  to  slow  down  but  to  remain  high.  In  the  15  initially  identified  Investment  Program \ntowns,2 or  urban  local  bodies  (the  Investment  Program  ULBs),  the  population  is  expected  to \ngrow by 2\u20137% per year over the next 10 years.  \n \n4. \nRajasthan\u2019s natural beauty and rich history\u2014about 80% of Indian heritage properties are \nin the state\u2014make it a favorite tourist destination and one of India\u2019s fastest growing. It received \nabout 17 million tourists in 2004, and this number is expected to grow to almost 20 million by \n2010.  The  tourism  sector,  directly  or  indirectly,  employs  15  million,  or  24%  of  the  state\u2019s  total \npopulation.  But  the  sector  accounted  for  just  14%  of  gross  state  domestic  product  (GSDP)  in \n2003\u20132004,  compared  with  21%  in  Kerala,  the  second-biggest  tourism  state.  To  increase \neconomic  growth  and  employment  opportunities,  Rajasthan  needs  to  establish  comparative \nadvantage  in  the  tourism  sector  not  only  through  proper  planning  and  developmental  controls \nbut also through better public infrastructure and an enabling environment for private investment \nin the sector.  \n \n5. \nThe  state\u2019s  economy  grew  by  an  average  of  6.2%  per  year  in  1980\u20132000,  one  of  the \nfastest  among  the  Indian  states.  Since  2000,  however,  annual  growth  rates  have  fluctuated \nsignificantly.  The  growth  rates  of  9.4%  in  2003,  -6.5%  in  2004,  and  1.5%3 in  2005  indicate \nincreasing economic volatility. In addition, severe droughts diminished the agriculture and allied \nsectors, and the investment rate averaged less than 16% of GSDP, well below India\u2019s average \nrate of 23%. While growth has picked up more recently, to 5% in 2005\u20132006 and 8.5% in 2006\u2013\n2007,  and  it  is  the  state\u2019s  utmost  agenda  to  restore  economic  growth  and  closing  the \ndevelopment gap.  \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the Investment Program is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The population of the Investment Program ULBs in 2006  was as follows: Jhalawar 48,054 (in 2001), Jhalrapatan \n30,103  (in  2001),  Jaisalmer  69.894,  Baran-Chhabra  96,798,  Barmer  92,203,  Bharatpur  229,807,  Bundi  94,593, \nAlwar  286,853,  Chittaurgarh  105,212,  Rajsamand  59,391,  Dhaulpur  110,157,  Karauli  75,133,  Churu  108,014, \nNagaur 100,077, Sawai-Madhopur 113,545, and Sikar 199,084. \n\n3  Gross  state  product  growth  rate  is  at  1993/94  constant  price.  The  figures  are  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India\u2019s \n\ndatabase. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAccording to the income poverty standards of the Government of India and the state of \n6. \nRajasthan,  15%  of  the  population  is  living  below  the  poverty  line  (2001  census).  Unlike  other \nstates,  Rajasthan  has  a  higher  percentage  of  households  living  below  the  poverty  line  in  the \nurban areas (20%) than in the countryside (14%). Moreover, even a marginally higher poverty \ncutoff would raise the poverty level significantly, since a large part of the population is clustered \njust above the poverty line.4 More than 20% of the urban population lives in slum areas.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\n7. \nThe  ADB  supported  project  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project \n(RUIDP) 5  has  provided  significant  improvements  in  provision  of  basic  urban  services,  and \nprovided capacity development to ULBs to manage urban services in six ULBs. The availability \nof  adequate  urban  services  in  other  urban  centers  however,  are  still  inadequate  because  of \npopulation pressures, the influx of tourists, and the generally poor management and operation \nof public services common to many cities in India\u2014plus lack of funds. The Investment Program \nroad map indicates that 80% of the urban population in the state has access to piped water. But \nmost  of  these  (80%)  receive  less  than  80  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)  of  potable  water,6 \nagainst  the  100\u2013175  lpcd  prescribed  by  the  Indian  Bureau  of  Standards.7 The  rest  get  their \ndrinking water through hand pumps (10%) or from tube wells and open wells (10%).  \n \nAbout  70%  of  urban  households  have  access  to  in-house  sanitation,  while  24% \n8. \n(predominantly from poor households) defecate in the open. Only 11 of 222 towns in the state \nhave  partial  sewerage.  Inadequate  sanitation,  with  wastewater  percolating  into  the  soil  and \noverflowing into drains and streams, presents environmental and health risks. The absence of \nsewerage  facilities  has  led  to  contamination  of  surface  water  in  and  around  towns,  and  open \ndrains  in  particular  contain  high  risk  of  waterborne  diseases.  Less  than  50%  of  solid  waste  is \ncollected,  house-to-house  services  reach  only  35%  of  households,  waste  is  unsegregated, \ndustbins  and  other  storage  are  insufficient,  waste  is  handled  manually  when  transported,  and \ncrude  open  dumping  has  taken  the  place  of  engineered  sanitary  landfills  and  proper  waste \nmanagement  facilities  in  more  than  80%  of  the  towns.  A  substantial  proportion  of  households \nregularly  dump  their  waste  onto  the  nearest  open  space  or  into  drains.  Equipment  use  is \ngenerally inefficient, and no records are kept of waste collected, transported, and disposed of. \nThese practices impact the health of the urban population in the state need to be addressed.  \n \n9. \nUrban  roads  in  all  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  are  in  poor  condition,  and  the  road \nnetwork and parking spaces cannot sustain the traffic volume, which has grown significantly in \nthe  last  decade.  Frequent  traffic  congestion  is  worsened  by  bad  roads  and  ineffective \nmanagement  and  enforcement.  In  Jaisalmer,  an  Investment  Program  ULB,  for  lack  of  parking \nspaces,  passengers  board  and  alight  from  vehicles  at  intersections,  causing  serious  traffic \ncongestion. \n \n10. \nUrban Institutional Framework. The analysis of the urban institutional framework made \nin the Investment Program road map suggests that weak urban management is responsible for \npoor  performance  in  urban  planning  and  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services  in  the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs.  Dedicated  urban  local  authorities  are  still  at  an  early  stage  of \n                                                 \n4  A cutoff 10% higher would increase urban poverty by some 34% and rural poverty by around 29% at the aggregate \n\nnational level.  \n\n5   ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor  the  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  Manila.  The  ULBs  covered  under  this  project  are \nAjmer, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur. \n\n6  Per capita water supply in the 222 towns in the state varies as follows: 40% get less than 60 liters per capita per \n\nday (lpcd); 36%, 60\u201380 lpcd; 14%, 80\u2013100 lpcd; and only 10% receive more than 100 lpcd.  \n\n7  Depending on the size of the town.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\ndevelopment,  and  urban  management  is  constrained  by  the  multiplicity  of  institutions  with \noverlapping  responsibilities.  The  functions  of  the  ULBs  are  largely  confined  to  solid  waste \nmanagement and minor roads. The ULBs have no control over the important basic services of \nwater  supply  and  sanitation.8 Water  supply  and  sanitation  services  are  provided  by  the  Public \nHealth Engineering Department (PHED) of the state. Town planning and land development are \nassigned to state authorities as well as to the ULBs.  \n \n11. \nInstitutional  Finances.  All  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  are  supported  by  the  state. \nThe  main  local  revenues  are  from  infrastructure  development  taxes  and  rental  income  from \nmunicipal properties. Water charges are levied in all Investment Program ULBs and collection \nefficiency  is  relatively  high,  at  around  80%.  However,  the  charges  are  far  below  the  operating \ncost  (about  23%  below)  because  of  low  tariffs  and  the  high  level  of  unaccounted-for  water \n(around 40\u201350%). Power supply costs, which make up a significant portion of the cost of water \nsupply operations, are paid by PHED.  \n \n12. \nLack of adequate revenue sources is affecting the operation and maintenance of urban \nservices by the ULBs. ULBs financial resources are mainly spend on salaries and administration \nrelated  expenses  (for  instance  80%  in  Alwar,  76%  in  Jaisalmer,  and  81%  in  Jhalawar  and \nJhalapatan), leaving limited resources for operation and maintenance. \n  \n13. \nGovernment  of  Rajasthan  (GoR)  has  recognized  that  urban  development  accelerates \nthe state\u2019s growth hence urban development has assumed a high priority. This can be seen by a \nsignificantly  large  allocation  for  urban  development  in  its  last  budget  (2005\u20132006).  Capital \nexpenditure, estimated at 4.5% of GSDP in 2005\u20132006, is directed to the sectors, water supply \nand  sanitation,  and  urban  development,  sectors  that  were  relatively  neglected  in  budget \nallocations during the 1990s. The change in emphasis, together with the financial sector reforms \nnow  being  undertaken  by  the  state  government  and  the  passage  of  the  74th  Constitutional \nAmendment  Act  in  1992,  which  laid  out  the  basis  for  decentralization  in  the  urban  sector  has \nbrought about some improvements, but inefficiencies in service delivery, inadequate investment \nto  expand  service  coverage,  and  lack  of  maintenance  of  assets  persists.  The  urban  sector  is \nanalyzed in greater detail in Appendix 2. \n \n14. \nExternal  Assistance.  ADB  has  extended  31  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  totaling \n$17.0 million to India\u2019s urban sector since 1993, and has approved $3.17 billion in loans for 13 \nprojects. The strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s assistance for the urban sector in India has been poverty \nreduction through shared growth, social development, and good governance. These objectives \nhave  been  translated  into  actions  by  mostly  integrated  urban  infrastructure  and  services \nprojects. Appendix 2 gives an overview of external assistance to Rajasthan.  \n \nLessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  urban  sector  in  India 9 and  its  recently \n15. \ncompleted urban sector study10 show the inherent complexity  of urban sector projects and the \nneed  for  close  coordination  between  agencies,  enhanced  institutional  capacity,  and  public \nsupport  in  their  implementation.  Important  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  urban \ndevelopment  projects  in  India,  and  with  RUIDP  in  particular,  have  been  incorporated  into  the \ndesign  of  the  proposed  Investment  Program.  The  key  lessons  learned  and  the  measures \n\n                                                 \n8  PHED is now transferring the responsibility for maintaining drainage to the ULBs while retaining ownership of the \n\nassets. \n\n9  ADB. 2006.

An update on the status of the RUIDP \nloan covenants is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n16. \nInvestment  Program  Rationale.  The rationale for the Investment Program, apart from \nthe national priority of planned development of major urban centers in the country, is economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction in Rajasthan. The fastest-growing sectors in the state are mostly \nin  the  urban  areas,  where  productivity  is  3.5  times  higher  than  in  the  countryside.  Hence,  the \nInvestment  Program  is  designed  to  assist  the  state  in  improving  urban  infrastructure  in  15 \nmedium-sized  ULBs,  which  were  strategically  selected  to  maximize  the  Investment  Program\u2019s \ncontribution to the state\u2019s overall economic growth, while maintaining regional balance. \n \n17. \nA  road  map  for  the  Investment  Program  including  the  investment  needs  of  the  urban \nsector has been prepared (see the Framework  Financing Agreement [FFA] for the Investment \nProgram, Schedule 1). In line with the policies of the Government of India and the government \nof  Rajasthan,  it  envisages  a  gradual  transition  to  a  more  efficient  and  accountable  system  of \nurban infrastructure provision and service delivery. Fifteen ULBs in Rajasthan have initially been \nidentified  for  assistance  with  their  municipal  functions  (delivery  of  basic  urban  services)  in  the \nInvestment  Program,  as  mandated  by  the  74th  Constitution  Amendment  Act  of  India.11 The \nInvestment  Program  will  initially  focus  on  investments  in  priority  subsectors,  namely,  urban \nwater  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  drainage,  transport  and \nroads,  slum  improvement,  and  supporting  infrastructure  for  cultural  heritage.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  subcomponent  will  comprise  institutional  strengthening  (computerization  and \nsupport  for  accounting  reforms),  training,  and  capacity  development,  directly  and  through  the \nCity Managers\u2019 Association and the Rajasthan Institute of Local Self Governance, as well as a \ncommunity  action  participation  program.  The  state  government  and  the  ULBs  will  also  be \nassisted in strengthening the reforms already initiated by the government of Rajasthan and the \nGovernment  of  India,  such  as  those  in  (i)  urban  finance  and  governance  reforms,  for  more \nsustainable  service  delivery;  and  (ii)  sustainable  revenue  generation  through  rationalized  user \ncharges and urban-based taxes.  \n \n18. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  applying  a  sector  loan  approach  to  allow  more  flexible \ninvestment decisions based on priorities (and constraints) within a sector policy and master plan \nframework, and ensure investments that are linked to reforms through subproject criteria.12 The \nsector loan approach is based on the following: (i) systematic analysis by the state government \nof the main problems in its urban areas, and the recommendations outlined in its 11th Five-Year \nPlan  (FYP),  master  plans,  and  city  development  plans;  (ii)  the  fact  that  the  Executing  Agency \n(EA), the Local Self Government Department (LSGD), is also now implementing the state\u2019s solid \nwaste  management  action  plan  and  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Scheme  for  Small  and \nMedium  Towns,  and  that  the  investment  program  will  be  implemented  by  an  investment \nprogram implementation unit (IPMU), which is an expansion of the existing project management \nunit for RUIDP; and (iii) policies like the draft Water Policy (2006), the Municipal Bill (2006), and \nthe draft Urban Housing and Habitat Policy (2007), are currently under finalization.  \n \n19. \nThree  sample  ULBs  were  selected  for  detailed  feasibility  studies,  namely,  Alwar,  the \nlargest  ULB  among  the  15  initially  identified  Investment  Program  ULBs  and  one  of  the \nfastest-growing cities in Rajasthan; Jaisalmer, a border town of significant tourism and strategic \nimportance; and Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan, the smallest among the Investment Program ULBs. The \nthree  ULBs  represent  the  various  topographies  and  different  economic  and  growth  conditions \nwithin the state, and include 22% of the total population of the Investment Program ULBs. \n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2006.

The  expected  outcome  will  be  increased  access  to  sustainable \nurban  infrastructure  and  services  for  1.6  million  people  in  the  Investment  program  ULBs,  and \nimproved capacity of the Investment Program ULBs to manage urban services in a sustainable \nway. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs  \n\nThe Investment Program outputs are grouped into two parts. Part A will improve (i) water \n21. \nsupply  systems  in  Investment  Program  ULBs  by  rehabilitating,  strengthening,  and  expanding \nnetworks and constructing new supply systems; (ii) sewerage and drainage by constructing new \nsystems and extending existing ones; (iii) solid waste collection, processing and treatment, and \ndisposal by developing sanitary landfill sites; (iv) road rehabilitation and road safety; (v) social \ninfrastructure, such as slum improvements and other municipal facilities that may be prioritized \nas  the  master  plans  are  updated  and  finalized;  and  (vi)  infrastructure  support  for  cultural \nheritage,  such  as  access  roads  and  sanitation  facilities.  The  outputs  in  Part B  will  involve \n(i) capacity  building  and  institutional  development  to  make  the  state  system  more  responsive, \nempower local government, improve the financial performance of the local bodies and service \nproviders,  and \nfor  citizens;  and  (ii) management  and \nimplementation support for the implementation of the Investment Program.  \n\nimprove  urban  services  overall \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Urban Infrastructure Improvements \n\nin  water \n\ntreatment \n\nimprovements \n\n22.  Water  Supply.  Investments  in  this  component  are  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  and \nquantity  of  water  supply\u2014to  135  lpcd  of  potable  water  on  average  to  consumers\u2014through \nsource  augmentation, \nfacilities,  distribution  system \nrehabilitation, monitoring, and loss reduction. Further, piped water supply service coverage will \nbe increased to 90% on average in the Investment Program ULBs, and unaccounted-for water \nreduced to 20% of total supply throughout the system over the Investment Program period. The \ninvestments will consist of: (i) immediate rehabilitation of water supply systems in all Investment \nProgram  ULBs  to  optimize  efficiency  and  minimize  losses,  and  implementation  of  a  long-term \nprogram of leak detection and repair; (ii) source augmentation and improvement or provision of \nwater  treatment  facilities;  (iii)  provision  of  universal  household  connections  and  metering,  and \nbulk  metering;  (iv) replacement  of  inefficient  pumping  machinery,  among  other  energy \nconservation  and  demand  management  measures,  to  reduce  the  operation  and  maintenance \nimprove  system  efficiency;  and \n(O&M)  costs  of \n(v) implementation  of  awareness  campaigns  and  water  conservation  measures,  such  as \nrainwater harvesting. \n \n23.  Wastewater  Management.  The  wastewater  management  improvements  are  aimed  at \ndeveloping  appropriate  sewerage  and  sanitation  systems  for  the  safe  disposal  of  sewage,  on \nthe  basis  of  a  sewage  flow  equivalent  to  80%  of  net  water  supply  to  households,  and \nmaximizing sewerage system coverage by optimizing flushing velocities or providing appropriate \nlow-cost  sanitation  facilities;  and  identifying  least-cost  options  for  establishing  the  sewerage \nsystem and the sewage treatment plant, and appropriate options for water recycling and reuse.  \n \n24. \nSolid  Waste  Management.  A  door-to-door  waste  collection  system  for  the  entire \nmunicipal area of the Investment Program ULBs will be developed and appropriate segregation \n\nthe  water  supply  systems  and \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nand treatment facilities provided for the municipal waste collected. The investments will include \nthe following: (i) implementation of a public awareness campaign and installation of household \nwaste collection equipment to maximize recycling and waste segregation at source; (ii) provision \nof waste collection and safe transport services; (iii) improvement of street sweeping and drain \nde-silting  services;  and  (iv)  construction  of  safe  solid  waste  processing  and  disposal  facilities, \nsuch  as  sanitary  landfills  and  composting  plants,  preferably  on  a  public-private  partnership \n(PPP) model, to minimize the waste to be landfilled. \n \n25. \nUrban  Drainage.  The  urban  drainage  improvements  are  aimed  at  eliminating  public \nhealth and flooding risks and pollution of surface waters by constructing adequate storm-water \ndrainage  facilities  for  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  Investments  in  this  subcomponent  will \ninclude  (i)  preparation  of  comprehensive  drainage  master  plans  for  the  Investment  Program \nULBs;  (ii)   construction  of  roadside  and  outfall  drains  to  carry  storm-water  runoffs  into  natural \nchannels  or  groundwater  recharging  areas;  and  (iii)  provision  of  adequate  equipment  and \nresources to maintain the drains. Investments will be based on the drainage master plans of the \nULBs  or  give  priority  to  densely  populated  areas  with  poor  drainage  and  recurrent  flooding \nproblems, and to slums. \n \n26. \nUrban Transport and Roads. The urban transport improvements will decongest the city \ncenters,  smooth  traffic  flow  through  the  ULBs,  and  increase  road  capacity  to  ensure  effective \ntraffic  management  and  transportation  in  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  Investments  will \ninclude  (i) development  of  traffic  management  plans;  (ii)  construction  of  roads  and  bridges  in \npriority  and  congested  areas  in  the  cities;  (iii)  construction  of  parking  spaces  and  public \ntransport terminals, as identified in the traffic management plan of the ULBs; and (iv) upgrading \nof roads and pedestrian facilities.  \n \n27. \nSocial  Infrastructure. This component is aimed at improving the quality of life in poor \nsettlements of the Investment Program ULBs, and providing the necessary facilities and support \nto the ULBs in responding to emergency needs, such as firefighting. The investment will include \nthe  improvement  of  slum  infrastructure  to  make  up  for  deficiencies  in  water,  sanitation,  road, \nstreetlight, and drainage services, as well as in community and town hall, rainwater harvesting, \nand other minor community infrastructure.  \n \nfor  Cultural  Heritage.  This  component  will  provide \n28. \ninfrastructure  support  for  identified  cultural  heritage  sites  and  monuments  in  the  Investment \nProgram ULBs.  \n\nInfrastructure \n\nSupport \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Capacity Development and Investment Program Management  \n\n29. \nCapacity  Development.  A  three-pronged  approach  will  be  taken  in  this  component, \nwhich  will  involve  assisting  Rajasthan  and  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  in  strengthening  the \nreforms  already  begun  by  the  state,  such  as  (i)  computerization,  tax  assessment,  and \ninfrastructure  mapping  with  the  help  of  a  geographic  information  system;  (ii)  transition  to \ndouble-entry  accounting  through  the  computerization  of  accounting  and  financial  management \nfunctions,  in  line  with  Rajasthan\u2019s  ongoing  State  Urban  Agenda  for  Rajasthan  program;  and \n(iii) training  of  Investment  Program  ULBs  and  line  department  staff  of  the  state  in  Investment \nProgram  implementation,  urban  service  management,  and  urban  governance,  by  training \ninstitutions  like  the  Rajasthan  Institute  of  Local  Self  Government.  This  component  of  the \nInvestment  Program  is  aimed  at  institutionalizing  a  system  that  will  facilitate  the  transfer  of \nurban service management responsibilities to the ULBs and enable the ULBs to plan, provide, \nand sustain the provision of urban services.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\n30. \nAt  the  LSGD,  particularly  its  Directorate  of  Local  Bodies,  and  at  the  Town  Planning \nDepartment, this component will improve and strengthen internal systems and procedures, and \nthe monitoring of ULB performance. In the Investment Program ULBs, the capacity development \ncomponent  will  enhance  urban  planning,  asset  inventory  and  management,  accounting,  and \nfinancial  management,  and  thus  help  ensure  sustainable  service  provision,  besides  providing \ntraining  in  project  development,  design,  and  implementation,  and  in  basic  service  delivery,  to \nmunicipal staff.  \n \n31. \nThe  capacity  development  program  will  also  include  a  community  action  participation \nprogram  (CAPP)  to  support  the  implementation  and  heighten  the  positive  impact  of  physical \nimprovements under the Investment Program. The CAPP will include capacity development in \nthe  communities,  particularly \nin  slum  areas  and  community-based \norganizations.  More  specifically,  the  CAPP  will  focus  on  (i)  disseminating  information  on  the \nInvestment Program, (ii) educating people about the connection between the environment and \nhealth  and  their  role  in  solid  waste  management,  and  (iii)  raising  awareness  of  the  cost \nimplications  of  improved  services.  The  activities  in  this  component  will  also  encourage  the \nparticipation  of  urban  residents,  including  the  women,  the  poor,  slum  communities,  and  other \nvulnerable  groups,  during  Investment  Program  implementation,  and  ensure  equal  sharing  of \nbenefits among them.  \n  \n32. \nInvestment Program Management. The investments in this component will support the \ncosts  of  Investment  Program  management  and  implementation,  including  the  incremental \nadministrative  costs  associated  with  IPMU  and  the  investment  program  implementation  units \n(IPIUs),  mainly  in  equipment  and  logistics.  This  component  will  also  fund  the  costs  of  the \nconsulting  services  to  these  units  to  assist  them  in  managing  the  Investment  Program  and  in \nundertaking detailed design and construction supervision during the Investment Program. \n\nfor  stakeholders \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nin  capacity  development  and  preparation,  and  will \n\nInvestment Program Preparation. The Investment Program was prepared jointly by the \n33. \ngovernment  of  Rajasthan  and  ADB.  The  state  government  used  consultants  already  hired  for \nRUIDP to carry out urgent preparatory work. ADB used the bridging TA (footnote 11) to mobilize \nconsultants  to  assist  the  state  government  in  preparing  the  Investment  Program.  Further,  the \nULBs  that  could  qualify  for  funding  under  the  Program,  the  district  collectorates,  and  the \nconcerned state agencies also provided necessary support in collecting data and preparing the \nProgram. This joint and multifaceted preparatory approach shortened the preparation period of \nthe Investment Program by almost half.  \n \nBridging  Technical  Assistance.  Grant  funding  under  the  bridging  TA  will  support  the \n34. \nstate  government \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  Investment  Program  as  soon  as  the  Facility  becomes  available.  The \nactivities  include  (i)  preparation  of  infrastructure  base  maps  for  all  the  Investment  Program \nULBs; (ii) conduct of the necessary survey, data collection, and studies to complete the detailed \ndesign  of  the  identified  subprojects  in  the  three  sample  ULBs;  (iii)  detailed  design  of  the \nsubprojects  in  the  sample  ULBs;  (iv) assistance  in  the  preparation  of  bid  documents  for  the \nidentified  subprojects;  and  (v)  support  to  the  EA  in  updating  the  resettlement  plans  and \nenvironmental assessment documents for the sample subprojects. Furthermore, the bridging TA \nwill allow the EA to use the clean development mechanism (CDM) for solid waste management \nsubprojects.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  under  this  cluster  TA  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \n35. \nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP). PPP will be promoted to assist the ULBs in capacity \ndevelopment and in the transition period before their takeover of responsibilities from the state \n\njump-start \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nentities.  As  part  of  the  wider  stakeholder  consultation  process,  a  workshop  with  local  private \nsector  representatives was  held  during  the  Appraisal  Mission  to  explore  opportunities  for  PPP \nand  seek  feedback  from  the  private  sector.  The  private  sector  partners  at  the  workshop \ndiscussed  their  preferred  contract  packaging  arrangements  and  modalities,  and  the  risks  they \nperceived in maximizing PPP in the Investment Program. The Investment Program will dovetail \nwith ADB\u2019s existing technical assistance13 in preparing and developing potential PPP contracts \nfor  identified  subprojects.  With  the  private  sector  feedback  in  mind,  PPP  modalities  such  as \nbuild-operate-transfer  or  extended  (5-year)  operation  and  maintenance  contracts  for  sewage \ntreatment  plants  (packaged  for  a  few  ULBs)  and  solid  waste  management  facilities  will  be \nexplored further and developed as appropriate for identified subprojects.14  \n \n36. \nGood  Governance.  The  Investment  Program  will  strengthen  good  governance  in  the \nULBs.  It  will  (i)  improve  financial  management  systems  for  greater  service  accountability; \n(ii) provide training to improve the  management of urban services and urban governance; and \n(iii) strengthen  local  stakeholders\u2019  participation  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  urban \nprojects, to enhance the accountability of ULBs to their citizens.  \n \n37.  Multitranche  Financing  Facility.  The Facility will allow flexibility in making investment \ndecisions  according  to  the  needs  and  constraints  of  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  within  a \nsector road map, and not according to predefined investment requirements in the conventional \nform  of  assistance.  It  will  further  allow  the  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  on  the \nbasis  of  the  readiness  of  individual  subprojects.  The  Investment  Program  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  ongoing  institutional  and  financial  reforms,  thus  building  a  long-term \npartnership  between  ADB,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  Government  of  India  and  the  state \ngovernment of Rajasthan, on the other. Further, the Facility will promote engagement in building \nthe  capacity  of  urban  institutions  and  local  bodies  and  defining  proper  incentives  for \nperformance  improvements,  with  individual  loans  being  linked  to  certain  reform  targets  over  a \nrealistic time frame.  \n \nLessons Learned. The Investment Program incorporates lessons learned from previous \n38. \nurban  sector  projects  in  India,  particularly  in  Rajasthan.  These  include  the  need  to  (i) assess \ncarefully  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  Implementing  Agency  and  the  ULBs;  (ii)  select \ncomponents on the basis of extensive consultations with stakeholders; (iii) design tranches with \nULBs\u2019  priorities  and  demands  in  mind;  and  (iv)  deal  with  areas  of  institutional  and  financial \nreform that were not addressed in previous interventions of ADB and other donor partners. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe cost of the investment plan for the Investment Program ULBs for the next 10 years \n39. \nis  estimated  at  $450  million,  of  which  $390  million  is  the  estimated  cost  of  the  Investment \nProgram, as summarized in Table 1 below. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and \nfinancier are provided in Appendix 4.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB.  2006.

Manila (TA 4890-IND, for $3 million, approved on 11 December 2006). \nThis TA will support the Government of India in mainstreaming PPPs at the central and state levels, and mobilize \nexisting resources in the Government in support of PPP in infrastructure development. Under this TA, a PPP cell \nhas been established in Rajasthan (September 2007). \n\n14 For  instance,  all  sewage  treatment  plant  (STP)  construction  and  operation  could  be  carried  out  under  either \nperformance-based  management  contracts  or  3-  to  5-year  extended  operation  and  maintenance  contracts  (the \ndefault  contractual  mode  for  STPs),  facilitating  operator  training  and  enabling  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  to \nmanage  the  facilities  and  services.  Similarly,  the  contracts  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  all  solid  waste \nmanagement facilities under the Investment Program will be either build-operate-transfer or extended (5\u201310 years) \noperation and maintenance contracts. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates for the Investment Program \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSubtotal (A1)\n\n75.2 \n70.3 \n9.9 \n14.6 \n40.2 \n5.9 \n11.8 \n3.5 \n231.4 \n\na.

The  financing  will  be  provided  under  a  facility \naccording  to  ADB  policy. 15  The  Facility  will  extend  multiple  loans  to  finance  a  range  of \nsubprojects  under  the  Investment  Program,  subject  to  the  submission  of  a  related  periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) by the Government of India and the execution of the related loan and \nproject  agreements.  The  Government  has  entered  into  an  FFA  with  ADB  that  satisfies  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  pilot  financing  instruments  and  modalities.

All  the  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans will apply to each loan, subject \nto any modifications that may be included in loan and project agreements. The Government of \nIndia may choose a currency (from among several eligible currencies) and interest rate regime \nfor  each  loan.  The  specific  terms  of  each  loan will  be  based  on  the  related  PFR,  with  interest \ndetermined according to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facilities. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Program Management  \n\n42. \nThe  EA  for  the  Investment  Program  will  be  the  LSGD,  which  is  under  the  Urban \nGovernance  Department  (UGD)  of  Rajasthan.  The  UGD,  through  its  Urban  Development \nDepartment  (UDD),  is  already  implementing  the  RUIDP.  Since  the  LSGD,  and  not  UDD,  has \njurisdiction  over  smaller  towns,  the  IPMU  will  be  established  under  the  LSGD,  which  will  be \nresponsible for the overall implementation and management of the Investment Program.  \n \n43. \nA state-level and interministerial empowered committee (EC) has already been formed \nto  provide  policy  guidance  and  coordination  for  all  ULBs  and  subprojects,  and  decide  on \nmatters  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  The  EC  is  chaired  by  the  minister  of  urban \ndevelopment and local self governance, and its members will include ministers, directors, and \nrepresentatives of other relevant government ministries and departments.16 A work finalization \ncommittee  (WFC)17 chaired  by  the  principal  secretary  for  urban  governance  has  also  been \nformed. The WFC will review subproject appraisal reports and give its final endorsement before \ntheir submission to ADB.  \n \nThe IPMU18 will be the Implementing Agency for the Investment Program and individual \n44. \nprojects  therein.  Its  staff  will  be  seconded  from  the  line  agencies  of  the  state  government \nresponsible for managing the urban facilities and services under the Investment Program, such \nas  PHED,  PWD,  and  the  Tourism  Department,  and  from  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  The \nIPMU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  director.  The  project  director  will  manage  the  Investment \nProgram and will coordinate with and report to the EC, the state government, and ADB on the \nProgram. The IPMU will be assisted by investment program management consultants (IPMCs) \nin  managing  the  Investment  Program  and  ensuring  the  technical  quality  of  design  and \nconstruction.  \n \n45. \nUnder  the  IPMU,  fifteen  IPIUs  will  be  established  at  the  zonal  and  subdivision  levels. \nThat  will  also  be  project  implementation  units  for  individual  project  as  applicable.  A  full-time \nIPIU  representative  will  be  appointed  in  each  Investment  Program  ULB.  These  IPIUs  will  be \n                                                 \n16 The  empowered  committee  chaired  by  the  minister,  urban  development  and  local  self  governance,  has  the \nfollowing  members:  additional  chief  secretary,  infrastructure;  principal  secretary,  finance  and  planning;  principal \nsecretary,  urban  governance;  principal  secretary,  art  and  culture;  secretary,  tourism;  secretary,  public  health \nengineering; secretary, local self government; and project director, RUIDP (member secretary). \n\n17 The WFC includes the LSGD  secretary, RUIDP project director and additional project director, concerned district \ncollectors,  local  bodies  director,  additional  commissioner  for  tourism,  archaeology  director,  medical  and  health \ndirector, PHED chief engineer, PWD chief engineer, chief town planner (from the town planning department), and \nsuperintending engineer (from the RUIDP project implementation unit concerned).  \n\n18 Since  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  of  RUIDP  is  already  successfully  implementing  RUIDP,  as \ndemonstrated  by  the  successful  rating  of  the  RUIDP  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Financial  Information  System  report,  the \ngovernment  of  Rajasthan  has  decided  to  reconstitute  the  PMU  of  RUIDP  into  the  IPMU  for  the  Investment \nProgram, to include a broader range of skills and representation from the Investment Program ULBs. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\nestablished in all ULBs and will carry out the daily implementation activities of the Investment \nProgram.  Further,  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  will  be  assisted  by  three  design  and  supervision \nconsultants  (DSCs)  in  preparing  the  design  documents,  managing  the  tendering  of  contracts, \nand supervising the construction works.  \n \nCity-level committees19 (CLCs) have been established under the chairmanship of district \n46. \ncollectors.  The  CLCs  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  or  more  often,  if  required,  to  review  project \nactivities, identify needed improvements, and guide the IPIUs in improving project performance. \nAlso joining the CLC will be representatives from the Department of Irrigation, in ULBs where \nthe \nwater  source  augmentation  subprojects  are  proposed,  and  representatives \nArchaeological  Survey  of  India  or  of  the  Department  of  Archaeology  Museum  of  the  state \n(whichever has the appropriate jurisdiction) and the Department of Tourism, wherever heritage \nand tourism subprojects are proposed. The Investment Program implementation arrangements \nare in Appendix 5.  \n\nfrom \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria  \n\n47.  While  the  subprojects  of  the  Investment  Program  have  generally  been  defined  at  this \nstage,  the  long-term  nature  of  the  Investment  Program  implies  that  certain  adjustments  may \nneed  to  be  made  during  implementation  as  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the  ULBs  change  over \ntime. Such adjustments will have to be systematic, should not contradict the overall objectives \nand  principles,  and  require  due  diligence  on  all  aspects  and  safeguards.  The  subproject \nselection  criteria,  comprising  the  technical,  environmental,  social,  institutional,  economic,  and \nfinancial criteria that will be considered in the ADB approval of PFRs are in Appendix 6. Fifteen \nULBs  with  an  estimated  total  population  of  around  1.6  million  (2001  census)  have  been \nidentified  initially  for  inclusion  in  the  Investment  Program.  All  these  ULBs  are  district \nheadquarters  or  ULBs  with  significant  tourism  and  cultural  heritage  importance.  The  selection \ncriteria of any other ULBs eligible for inclusion in the Investment Program are in Appendix 6. \n\n3. \n\nApproval Procedures for Subprojects and Tranches \n\n48. \nFor  subprojects  to  be  included  in  the  first  PFR,  subproject  preparation  and  appraisal \nhave been completed. For subprojects under the subsequent loans of the Investment Program, \nan approval procedure, as outlined in Appendix 6, has been agreed on. After ADB\u2019s approval, \nand subject to any modifications and measures required by ADB, the IPMU will prepare PFRs \nfor ADB\u2019s financing. The PFRs will be formally submitted to ADB for further processing by the \nGovernment  of  India.  Each  PFR  will  contain  the  following:  (i)  required  loan  amount; \n(ii) subprojects and components to be financed under the loan; (iii) cost estimates and financing \nplan;  (iv) implementation  arrangements;  (v)  confirmation  of  the  continuing  validity  of  and \nadherence  to  the  provisions  of  the  FFA;  (vi)  confirmation  of  compliance  with  the  provisions \nunder  previous  loan  agreements  and  project  agreements,  as  appropriate;  and  (vii) other \ninformation required under the facility administration memorandum to be prepared and agreed \non by ADB and the Government of India, to facilitate the implementation and processing of the \nFacility.  \n\n                                                 \n19 The  CLCs  will  be  chaired  by  the  district  collectors  and  members  of  parliament,  members  of  the  legislative \nassembly;  mayor;  chairman  and  vice  chairman  of  the  municipal  council;  chairman/secretary,  urban  improvement \ntrust:  superintending  engineer,  public  health  engineering  department;  superintending  engineer,  public  works \ndepartment;  commissioner,  municipal  council;  principal  medical  officer,  medical  and  health;  senior  town  planner, \ntown  planning  department;  superintending  engineer,  RUIDP  project  implementation  unit;  and  representatives  of \nlocal nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations as its members. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n49. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  in  three  or  more  tranches  over  7  years \n(2007\u20132014).  The  tranches  will  be  based  on  the  readiness  of  subprojects,  in  terms  of  their \ntechnical,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards,  due  diligence,  and \nland  acquisition \nrequirements,  as  well  as  on  the  intended  phasing  of  the  urban  improvement  works,  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies,  and  the  subproject  selection  criteria.  The \nimplementation  period  for  each  tranche  or  loan  is  not  more  than  5  years.  The  implementation \nschedule of the Investment Program under each of the loans is in Appendix 7. The recruitment \nof IPMCs and DSCs and the construction of civil works and the purchase of equipment under \nthe  first  loan,  in  particular  civil  works  of  fully  appraised  subprojects  for  the  three ULBs  (Alwar, \nJaisalmer,  and  Jhalawar-Jhalarapatan),  are  expected  to  start  immediately  after  the  first  loan \ntakes effect, through advance procurement actions and retroactive financing. \n\n5. \n\nProcurement  \n\n50. \nAll  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  the  loans  under  the  Facility  will  be  procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works \ncontracts costing at least $10 million will be procured through international competitive bidding; \nall  other  such  contracts  that  cost  less  than  $10  million  will  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB).  As  far  as  practicable,  goods  will  be  procured  in  packages  of  more \nthan $1 million to be suitable for international competitive bidding. Otherwise, goods costing less \nthan $1 million per contract will be procured through NCB or limited international bidding, and \nmiscellaneous  minor  goods  costing  less  than  $100,000  through  shopping.  The  feasibility  of \ncommunity contracting will be examined individually for slum upgrading and low-cost sanitation \nand  other  community  works  costing  up  to  $100,000.  All  NCB  procurement  under  the  loans \nshould comply with the procurement procedures agreed on for the Facility and use the standard \nbidding documents approved by ADB. The government of Rajasthan has modified the standard \nNCB  bidding  documents  used  under  RUIDP,  which  were  reviewed  and  accepted  by  ADB  in \n2004, to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  to  incorporate  lessons  learned  from  the  RUIDP  implementation.  These  bidding \ndocuments  have  been  reviewed  and  modified  as  necessary  by  ADB  for  consistency  with  the \nupdated ADB requirements.  \n \n51. \nThe procurement plan in Appendix 8, which details indicative packages to be funded by \nthe first loan under the Facility, will be updated annually by the Executing Agency for approval \nby  ADB.  The  design  of  the  contract  packages  incorporates  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  past \nurban projects in India. For instance, the procurement of similar equipment, such as bulk water \nmeters,  pump  machineries,  and  solid  waste  equipment,  will  be  centralized  and  the  equipment \nwill  then  be  distributed  by  the  IPMU  to  the  IPIUs  for  installation  in  the  ULBs.  Additionally, \ncontract  packages  like  the  design  and  construction  of  sewage  treatment  plants  have  been \ncombined for neighboring ULBs to increase the contract size and contractor participation. Cost \nestimates will be based on the indices that will be used in updating the Investment Program.  \n  \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n52. \nConsultants  will  be  hired  for  the  projects  under  the  Facility  according  to  ADB\u2019s  \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based  selection  (QCBS)  procedures  under  the  aforementioned  guidelines  will  be  used  in \nhiring a national consulting firm (443 person-months) to provide IPMCs, and three national firms \nto provide DSCs for 1,464 person-months. The IPMCs will be based in Jaipur and will assist the \nIPMU  in  managing  the  Investment  Program  and  ensuring  the  technical  quality  of  design  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\nconstruction.  The  three  DSCs  will  assist  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  in  preparing  the  design \ndocuments,  managing  the  tendering  of  contracts,  and  supervising  the  construction  works,  and \nwill  be  individually  located  in  three  head  offices,  as  follows:  (i) head  office  at  Bharatpur  and \nsub-headquarters at Alwar, Bharatpur, Dhaulpur, Karauli, and Sawai Madhopur; (ii) head office \nat Nagaur and sub-headquarters at Barmer, Churu, Jaisalmer, Nagaur, and Sikar; and (iii) head \noffice  at  Jhalawar  and  sub-headquarters  at  Baran-Chhabra,  Bundi,  Chittaurgarh, \nJhalawar-Jhalrapatan, and Rajsamand. Outline terms of reference for the consulting packages \nare in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n53. \nUnder  each  loan  of  the  Facility,  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  and  equipment  and \nmaterials,  and  recruitment  of  consulting  services,  may  be  requested,  subject  to  their  eligibility \nunder  the  agreed  procedures  and  guidelines.  Except  as  otherwise  agreed  on  with  ADB,  the \nexpenditures  incurred  for  this  purpose  will  qualify  for  retroactive  financing  of  up  to  20%  of  the \nproposed amount of the loans under the Facility, for eligible expenditures incurred before each \nloan  takes  effect,  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  loan  agreement  is  signed.  The \nGovernment  and  state  government  of  Rajasthan  have  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance relevant projects \nunder the Facility.   \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangement \n\n54. \nDisbursements  of  each  loan  proceeds  under  the  Facility  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Each  PFR  will  result  in  a \nseparate  loan  agreement,  which  will  describe  the  detailed disbursement  arrangements  agreed \non  by  the  Government  of  India,  the  government  of  Rajasthan,  and  ADB.  Each  loan  under  the \nFacility will have its own imprest account in the Reserve Bank of India for the use of IPMU, to \nensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  speed  up  implementation.  The  amount  in  the \nimprest  accounts  and  the  SGIAs  at  any  given  time  should  be  equivalent  to  6  months  of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the related loan amount, whichever is less. The said imprest \naccount  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. Individual payments under the statement-of-expenditures procedures will for eligible \nexpenditures not exceed the equivalent of $100,000 per payment.  \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Government  of  India  and  the  government  of  Rajasthan  will  have  the  detailed \n55. \nconsolidated  Investment  Program  accounts  maintained  by  the  IPMU  audited  by  independent \nauditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. The \naudited  accounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  9  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  The \nannual  audit  report  will  include  the  audit  of  the  central  imprest  account  and  the  statement-of-\nexpenditures (SOE) procedure, and will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use \nof  loan  proceeds,  and  compliance  with  SOE  procedures.  The  government  of  Rajasthan  has \nbeen made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission, and its requirements for satisfactory \nand acceptable-quality audited accounts.  \n \n56. \nThe  IPMU  must  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the  implementation  of \neach  project  within  45  days  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  The  progress  reports  will  cover  the \nprogress  made  during  the  period  under  review,  any  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule, \nproblems or difficulties met and remedial actions taken, and work to be done and subprojects or \ncomponents  proposed  for  financing  in  the  coming  quarter.  The  reports  will  also  include  a \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nsummary financial account for each implementing agency, expenditures to date, and a report on \nbenefit  monitoring.  On  the  basis  of  the  quarterly  progress  reports,  ADB  will  prepare  annual \nimplementation progress reports to be submitted to the Board each December. The IPMU will \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the \nsubprojects  financed  under  each  loan,  and  a  facility  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the \nphysical completion of all supported activities and subprojects under the Facility. These reports \nwill  describe  the  details  of  implementation,  costs,  monitoring  and  evaluation  results,  problems \nencountered and actions taken, and other relevant information that ADB may request.  \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures  \n\n57. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  inspect,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Investment  Program.  In  this \nregard,  investigation,  if  any,  of  government  officials  would  be  requested  by  ADB  to  be \nundertaken  by  the  Government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nInvestment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nInvestment Program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the EA, the IPMU, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Investment Program. The government of Rajasthan will \ndisclose  procurement  under  the  Investment  Program,  as  well  as  the  criteria  for  subproject \nselection,  and  the  results  of  the  selection  will  be  posted  on  the  Investment  Program  office \nbulletin board and website.  \n \n58. \nThe adoption of the PPP modality, which would bring in competent private parties who \nwill be held accountable for clearly identified outputs in a comprehensive manner, is expected to \nfurther  mitigate  the  risks  of  corruption.  The  introduction  of  e-governance  in  the  Investment \nProgram  ULBs  will  streamline  systems  and  procedures  and  provide  access  to  a  robust \nmanagement information system with information on the ULBs\u2019 financial management practices \nand  fiscal  status.  Rajasthan  will  ensure  strict  adherence  to such  project-specific  anticorruption \nmeasures. \n \n\n11. \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n59. \nThe  IPMU  will  ensure  that  an  investment  program  performance  management  system \n(IPPMS) satisfactory to ADB is established within 3 months of the time the first loan under the \nFacility  takes  effect.  The  IPPMS  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  Investment \nProgram,  as  well  as  of  subprojects  under  each  loan,  including  key  impact  and  outcome \nindicators and associated assumptions with corresponding target dates. For subprojects under \nthe  PPP  modalities,  such  as  performance-based  management  contracts,  or  extended  O&M \ncontracts, as applicable, key performance indicators satisfactory to ADB will be developed when \nrequests for proposals and draft contract documents are prepared for each subproject.  \n \n\n12. \n\nInvestment Program Review  \n\n60. \nInvestment Program Review. After a review of the quarterly progress reports, ADB will \nmeet with representatives of the government of Rajasthan as required to discuss the progress \nof the Investment Program under each loan, any changes in the implementation arrangements, \nor remedial measures that are needed to achieve the overall objectives of specific subprojects \nand components and of the overall Investment Program.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\n \nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews,  including  a  midterm  review  for  each  loan,  a  detailed \n61. \nmidterm review of the Facility will be done 4 years after the first loan takes effect. The midterm \nreview  for  each  loan  under  the  Facility  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  implementation \nperiod  of  each  loan.  The  midterm  reviews  will  evaluate  in  detail  the  scope  of  the \nFacility/projects,  implementation  arrangements,  any  outstanding  issues,  environment  and \nresettlement  as  well  as  other  safeguard  issues,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  contract \nmanagement progress, and other issues, as appropriate.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impact  \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n62. \nThe  economic  analysis  has  reviewed  (i)  the  economic  rationale  for  government \ninvolvement  in  the  Investment  Program,  (ii)  the  goals  of  the  Program,  (iii)  sector  development \nplans,  (iv)  associated  economic  policies,  (v)  government  capacity,  (vi)  the  fiscal  impact  of  the \nProgram, (vii) the economic risks associated with the Program, (viii) government commitment to \nthe  Program,  (ix)  coordination  of  foreign  aid,  and  (x)  the  conditions  attached  to  the  loan.  The \neconomic rationale for government involvement is sound, as the Investment Program supports \nonly the basic urban services with monopolistic conditions, externality management, and impact \non  income  distribution.  The  goals  of  the  Investment  Program  are  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s goals of enhancing economic growth and reducing poverty, as clearly reflected in \nthe  10th  FYP  and  other  policy  documents.  The  strategy  of  the  Investment  Program,  which \ncombines  physical  investments  with  support  for  ongoing  urban  institutional  and  financial \nreforms,  conforms  fully  to  the  Government\u2019s  core  objective  of  linking  funding  to  improved \ninstitutional performance, as clearly stipulated in the 10th FYP and the recent Jawaharlal Nehru \nNational  urban  Renewal  Mission  Program.  The  scope  of  investments  under  the  Investment \nProgram  is  based  on  growth  strategies,  city  development  plans  prepared  for  some  of  the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs,  available  master  plans,  state  plans,  extensive  consultations \nreflecting  the  priorities  of  all  stakeholders,  demand  projections,  and  assessment  of  the \ninstitutional absorptive capacity to develop and sustain infrastructure assets.  \n \n63. \nEach  urban  infrastructure  sector  supported  under  the  Investment  Program  has  its \nsector-specific goal, as stated in the Government of India\u2019s and the state government\u2019s sector \npolicy  and  guidelines,  within  the  overall  framework  of  the  draft  Rajasthan  Urban  Housing  and \nHabitat  Policy,  2007.  Each  Investment  Program  ULB  must  prepare  a  city-level  infrastructure \nplan  which  proposes  the  most  cost-effective  way  of  meeting  the  sector  goals  and  identifies \nsubprojects  to  be  undertaken  under  the  Investment  Program.  The  economic  subproject \nselection  criteria  under  the  Investment  Program  ensure  that  these  identified  subprojects  are \neconomically  viable,  mostly  by  demonstrating  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  not  less \nthan 12%. The economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D.   \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n64. \nThe  financial  analysis  has  appraised  the  sustainability  and  viability  of  the  subprojects \nproposed  under  the  Investment  Program,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and \nAnalysis of Projects, 2005. For revenue-generating sectors\u2014water supply, sewerage, and solid \nwaste management\u2014incremental revenue and cost due to the subprojects were estimated on a \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nwith- and without- project basis.20 Tariff revisions for water supply, and solid waste management \nare  proposed  to  meet  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  institutional  and  financial  reform  action  plan \nwhich is in accordance with the mandatory reforms under India\u2019s JNNURM signed in 2006. The \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for water supply subprojects ranges from 8% to 14.5%, for \nsewerage  subprojects  from  1.2  to  11.8%,  and  for  solid  waste  management  subprojects  from \n8.4%  to  20%.  Hence,  except  for  the  sewerage  subproject  in  Alwar,  all  the  subprojects  have \nFIRRs  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.97%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows \nFIRRs that are generally robust and most sensitive to changes in revenues.  \n \nFor non-revenue-generating sectors\u2014urban drainage, urban transport and roads, social \n65. \ninfrastructure, and heritage support infrastructure\u2014the analysis focused on the capacity of the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs  to  sustain  the  assets  created  under  the  Program  by  providing \nfinancial resources for maintenance and debt service, if any. Financial projections of cash flow \nwere made over a 15-year period for the Investment Program ULBs, incorporating the impact of \nthe subprojects as well as the proposed reform. As part of the reform, the state abolished the \npoorly  performing  property  tax  in  January  2007  and  has  substituted  it  with  a  broad  based \ninfrastructure development tax to raise the financial resources of the ULBs which are dependent \non the state\u2019s grant and transfer. For the three sample Investment Program ULBs, the financial \nprojections show that the ULBs can absorb the investment in appraised subprojects, as they are \nexpected to have a revenue account surplus by 2013\u20132014 and a positive close balance for the \nrevenue account by the end of the projection period. The financial analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix  E,  and  the  financial  management  assessment  of  the  EA  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development \n\n66. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  widen  access  to  better-quality,  sustainable  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  Basic  needs  provision,  living \nconditions,  and  public  health  will  all  improve.  There  will  also  be  broader  benefits,  including \neconomic  growth  and  employment  generation.  Safe  drinking  water  is  a  basic  need  that  is  not \neasily  accessible  to  a  significant  number  of  poor  people  in  the  ULBs.  According  to  baseline \nsurveys,21 piped water is accessible through household connections to 19% of those living in the \nslums  of  Jhalawar,  and  to  39%  of  those  in  slums  in  Alwar.  Better  access  to  water  of  better \nquality will also ease the burden of water collection (1 hour per day) on vulnerable segments of \nthe  population,  particularly  for  women.  Low  water  connection  fees  (paid  in  installments)  and \nlifeline tariffs will make drinking water more affordable to the poor. None of the slum areas in the \nthree sample ULBs have underground sewerage systems; only 7% of the households in those \nareas  reportedly  have  individual  toilets,  and  more  than  70%  resort  to  open  defecation. \nSewerage  networks  will  reach  the  boundaries  of  slum  areas  and  give  a  large  number  of \nhouseholds access to low-cost toilets. The collection and disposal of waste is highly irregular. In \nthe  slum  areas,  more  than  75%  of  the  households  dispose  of  waste  along  nearby  roads. \nImprovements in sewage treatment, sanitation, and solid waste management will improve public \nhealth and reduce the burden of disease, treatment costs, and productivity losses, particularly \namong the poor. The urban road and cultural heritage components will benefit poor households \nthrough  employment  generation  and  access.  The  impact  of  improved  urban  services  on  the \nurban  poor  will  be  monitored  closely  during  project  implementation.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n                                                 \n20 Since the Investment Program uses a phased approach,  and  not all the sector investment is included in the first \nloan,  the  appraisal  is  limited  to  those  subprojects  that  have  already  been  identified  and  are  ready  for \nimplementation. \n\n21 Baseline surveys were conducted in the three sample towns, namely, Alwar, Jaisalmer, and Jhalawar.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n\n67. \nCommunity  development  is  a  key  objective  of  the  slum  improvement  component. \nthrough \nCommunity  development  programs \nin  poor  communities, \nnongovernment  organizations,  will  focus  on  health  and  environmental  sanitation  awareness, \nlow-cost  sanitation  infrastructure,  and  the  organization  of  self-help  groups.  The  Investment \nProgram is expected to benefit women by reducing their burden of water collection, improving \nhealth benefits, and increasing employment opportunities.  \n\nimplemented \n\nto  be \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\nSocial.  The  Facility  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact. \n68. \nSubprojects involving rehabilitation will be accommodated within the existing facilities\u2019 premises \nand will not involve land acquisition and resettlement. Subprojects involving the construction of \nwater supply and sanitation and sewerage systems, drainage and landslip protection, and solid \nwaste management improvements are proposed on vacant government land wherever possible. \nThe  overall  impact  will  be  further  minimized  through  careful  subproject  siting  and  alignment \nduring  detailed  design  and  subproject  implementation.  A  resettlement  framework  (RF)  was \nprepared on the basis of national laws; the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended in 1984); the \nNational  Policy  on  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  for  Project  Affected  Persons,  2003;  and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). To guide the implementation of subprojects, the \nRF  outlines  the  objectives,  policy,  principles,  and  procedures  for  land  acquisition  (if  required), \ncompensation, and other assistance measures for affected persons. The implementation of the \nresettlement  plans  will  be  monitored  by  the  IPIU  with  assistance  from  the  IPMU  (for  internal \nmonitoring)  and  an  independent  agency  appointed  by  the  EA  (for  external  monitoring).  A \nsummary  of  the  RF  is  in  Appendix  10  and  a  full  RF  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G. \nResettlement  plans  (RPs)  will  be  prepared  for  Facility  subprojects  on  the  basis  of  the  RF. \nSubprojects with significant22 impact require full RPs, while subprojects with insignificant impact \nwill  require  short  RPs.  The  RPs  will  ensure  that  the  socioeconomic  conditions,  needs,  and \npriorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  does  not  disadvantage  these  groups.  Short  RPs  have  already  been  prepared  for \ntranche 1 subprojects (Supplementary Appendix H). \n  \n69. \nindigenous  peoples  (IPs). \nEnvironmental  and  public  health  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  whole  population  covered  by  the \nProgram. The likelihood of subprojects affecting IPs is small, and any likely impact is addressed \nin  the  RPs.  Further,  subproject  design  prioritizes  rehabilitation  over  the  construction  of  basic \nsocial  infrastructure,  thus  avoiding  land  acquisition  and  consequent  resettlement,  and \nsubproject  siting  in  built-up  areas.  An  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  has  been \nformulated  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  I)  to  ensure  that  appropriate  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  plans  or  specific  actions  are  prepared  to  enable  equal  sharing  of  Investment \nProgram benefits in future subprojects with impact on indigenous peoples. \n\ninitial  screening  shows  no \n\nIn  all  cities, \n\nimpact  on \n\n \nEnvironmental.  The  Facility  is  designed  to  maximize  environmental  and  public  health \n70. \nbenefits.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  conducted  for  the  Program  show  that  net \nenvironmental benefits are positive and large including: more and better-quality drinking water \nfrom  water  supply  subprojects;  better  public  health,  particularly  fewer  waterborne  diseases \nthrough water supply, sewerage, drainage, and solid waste management investments; improved \naesthetics as a result of the sewerage, drainage, and solid waste management works; reduced \nflooding  through  drainage  improvements;  reduced  exposure  to  suspended  particulates  and \nnoise pollution through the urban transport and road components; and social benefits from the \nslum improvement and civic infrastructure outputs. Any negative impact during construction and \n\n                                                 \n22 Resettlement is significant when it has a major impact on 200 or more people. Major impact is defined as physical \n\ndisplacement from housing or loss of 10% or more of productive, income-generating assets. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\noperation  will  not  be  significant  because  larger  facilities  will  be  built  in  low-density  and \nnonsensitive areas, the works are generally small in scale and quickly constructed, and simple \ntechnologies  with  low  maintenance  requirements  will  have  preference  (Appendix  11;  IEEs  for \ntranche 1 subprojects in Supplementary Appendix J). \n \nThe  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  ensure  that  the  projects  under  the \n71. \nFacility  will  have  no  significant  negative  environmental \nimpact  on \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas.  Subprojects  with  significant  and  permanent  impact  will  be \nrejected.  The  potential  negative  environmental  impact  is  mostly  localized  and  temporary,  and \ncan  largely  be  avoided  through  proper  subproject  design  (particularly  in  siting),  or  mitigated \nthrough  proper  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management.  The  environmental \nassessment and review framework, which will ensure the compliance of future subprojects with \nthe environmental guidelines and requirements of the Government of India and the government \nof  Rajasthan,  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  guidelines,  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n\nimpact,  and  no \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\n72. \nThe  effectiveness  of  the  infrastructure  to  be  developed  under  the  Investment  Program \ndepends  on  the  ownership  and  commitment  of  the  state  of  Rajasthan  and  the  Investment \nProgram ULBs. The State and the ULBs must be committed to institutional change and financial \nreforms,  and  particularly  to  cost  recovery  and  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  assets  and \nservices. There must be sustained political will to increase tariffs and implement service charges \nor property taxes in order to achieve cost recovery within a reasonable time. Therefore, a key \nrisk  is  that  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  will  not  have  enough  revenues  to  manage  and \nmaintain the existing and newly acquired assets properly and may be forced to minimize costs \nthrough inappropriate operations. The government of Rajasthan and the ULBs are committed to \nmaximizing  local  revenue  and  providing  an  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  budget  for \nasset sustainability. The government of Rajasthan has prepared a transition plan for transfer of \nassets from PHED to  ULBs, and has introduced an infrastructure development tax.  The ULBs \nare thus expected to take over the responsibilities for urban service provision gradually as the \nassets  are  transferred  to  them  and  they  obtain  the  resources  and  revenues  to  adequately \nmanage the assets. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government of India and the government of \n73. \nRajasthan have given the following assurances, which have been incorporated in the FFA, and \nwill be incorporated in the individual loan agreements as applicable, subject to any amendment \nto be mutually agreed on by the Government of India, government of Rajasthan and ADB. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  government  of  Rajasthan  will  make  available  sufficient  counterpart  funds \nfrom  its  budget  for  each  fiscal  year,  in  a  timely  manner,  for  the  efficient \nimplementation of the Investment Program and the Facility toward its contribution \nand that of the ULBs.  \nThe  government  of  Rajasthan  will  ensure  adequate  funds  toward  the  operation \nand  maintenance  of  the  facilities  created  under  the  Facility  through  budgetary \nallocations  or  other  means,  to  be  provided  to  the  Executing  Agency,  the \nappropriate ULB, or line agencies during and after subproject completion. \nThe Government of India will make available to the government of Rajasthan the \nproceeds of the financing provided by ADB.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthe \n\nfinancial \n\ninstitutional  and \n\nThe government of Rajasthan will on-lend the loan proceeds to the ULBs under \nthe appropriate on-lending arrangements. \nThe  government  of  Rajasthan  will  ensure  that  for  each  of  the  Investment \nProgram  ULBs, \nimprovement  action  plan \n(Appendix 12 of the RRP) is implemented on schedule.  \nThe  government  of  Rajasthan  will ensure  that the  contractual  documents  under \nany  PPP  modality,  in  particular  extended  O&M,  build-operate-transfer,  or \nperformance-based  management  contracts,  as  applicable,  are  provided  to  ADB \nfor prior review and approval in order to be used under the individual subprojects. \nThe  government  of  Rajasthan  will  ensure  that  all  ULBs  and  subprojects  therein \nare selected, processed, and implemented in accordance with Appendix 6 of the \nRRP and schedule 5 of the FFA (on safeguard compliances) as further detailed \nin the FFA.   \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  government  of  Rajasthan  will  ensure  that  90%  customer  metering  is \nachieved  in  the  relevant  ULBs  within  3  years  of  the  completion  of  water  supply \nsubprojects in the ULBs concerned.  \nThe government of Rajasthan will ensure that the PHED/ULB sets up a separate \naccounting system for water supply and sewerage for the ULB before the start of \nworks on any water supply subproject in the ULB. \nFor urban transport and road subprojects, prior to commencement of civil works, \nthe ULB will have prepared a city wide traffic and transportation plan.  \nThe government of Rajasthan will ensure that domestic waste is segregated from \nindustrial,  medical,  and  hazardous  waste \nin  ULBs  where  solid  waste \nmanagement subprojects are being implemented under the Facility, to be treated \nseparately  according  to  the  prescribed  system  in  the  Municipal  Solid  Waste \nManagement and Handling Rules, 2000 of the Government of India.   \nThe  government  of  Rajasthan  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts  under  the \nFacility  follow  all  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Government  of  India  and  the \ngovernment  of  Rajasthan  and  that  these  further  include  provisions  to  the  effect \nthat  contractors;  (i)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  for  labor;  and \ndisseminate  information  at  worksites  on  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases \nand HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures for those employed during \nconstruction;  and  (ii)  follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor \n(including  not  employing  or  using  children  as  labor,  equal  pay  for  equal  work), \nhealth,  safety,  welfare,  sanitation,  and  working  condition.  Such  contracts  shall \nalso include clauses for termination by the government of Rajasthan or the EA in \ncase of any breach of the stated provisions by the contractors.  \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Approval of the second PFR that may be submitted by India would be subject to \nreview  by  ADB  of  the  progress  in  implementing  the  water  tariff  reform  in  those \nULBs  that  have  introduced  the  revised  water  tariffs  in  September  2007, \naccording to the institutional and financial improvement action plan (Appendix 12 \nof the RRP).  \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n74. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of

But  Rajasthan \nstarted  to  close  the  development  gap  in  the  1980s,  and  growth  rates  accelerated  sharply, \nreaching 6.2% in 1980\u20132000, one of the highest among Indian states; poverty fell significantly, \nfrom 27% in 1994 to 15% in 2000, and several human development indicators1 showed notable \nimprovements.  The  high  growth  rates  were  driven  by  rapid  growth  in  industry  and  services, \nwhich  created  a  more  diversified  economy  and  lowered  volatility;  investments  in  irrigation, \nelectricity,  and  road  connectivity;  and  an  increase  in  human  capital.  Since  then,  however,  the \nstate\u2019s growth performance has faltered, threatening the progress made over the last 7 years. \nSince  2000,  annual  growth  rates  have  fluctuated  significantly,  from  9.4%  in  2003  to  -6.5%  in \n2004 and 1.5% in 2005, indicating increasing economic volatility. Three droughts in the past 5 \nyears, rapidly depleting groundwater levels, and falling investment rates have all contributed to \ndecelerating growth. While the growth rate has picked up in recent years, to 5% in 2006 and 8% \nin 2007, the state is determined to revive growth and close the development gap.  \n \n2. \nThe level of urbanization (24% in the 2001 census) in the state is less than that of India \nas a whole (28%), but the urban population grew rapidly in the 1990s (2.7%) because of high \nnatural  growth  rates  and  rural  migration.  The  2001  census  of  India  expected  the  level  of \nurbanization to increase to 26% by  2012, and the 222 urban towns in the state to increase to \n230 by 2012. The majority of the urban population (57%) is concentrated in 20 towns, each with \na population of more than 100,000. Future population growth rates are projected to decline but \nwill  remain  high.  The  population  of  the  15  initially  identified  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs)  to  be \nfunded under the Investment Program ranges from 75,133 (Karauli) to 286,853 (Alwar).2 From \nthe  2001  census  figures,  population  growth  in  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  is  expected  to \nrange  from  2%  to  7%  per  year  over  the  next  decade.  As  population  shifts  from  rural  to  urban \nareas  in  pursuit  of  economic  opportunities,  more  and  more  slums  are  emerging  in  the  urban \nareas: more than 20% of the urban population currently lives in slums. A survey conducted in \nthree  Investment  Program  ULBs3  showed  that the  percentage  of  slum  population ranged  from \n4% in Jhalawar-Jhalapatan and 7% in Alwar to 27% in Jaisalmer.  \n  \nAn  assessment  of  urban  infrastructure  and  service  conditions  undertaken  during  the \n3. \npreparation of the Investment Program road map indicated that urban services, including water \nsupply, sanitation, drainage, solid waste management, urban transport, and roads, are grossly \ninadequate in the towns. According to the state\u2019s water policy, the goal is to provide the entire \npopulation with potable water supply within 150 meters from their premises within the next 10 \nyears.  The  guidelines  of  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  Central  Public  Health  Environmental  and \nEngineering  Organization  on  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  prescribe  a  water  supply \nservice  level  of  100\u2013175  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)4  depending  on  the  size  of  the  towns, \nwith  continuous  supply,  adequate  water  pressure,  and  satisfactory  water  quality.  According  to \nthe 2001 census, about 20% of urban households have no water supply within their premises, \n\n                                                 \n1  The human development index for Rajasthan improved from 0.347 in 1991 (11th rank) to 0.424 in 2001 (9th rank). \nAlthough  Rajasthan  has  ranked  steadily  higher  over  the  last  three  decades,  its  present  rank  is  still  below  the \nnational Index value and quite low among the major states of India.   \n\n2  The population of the Investment Program towns in 2006 was as follows: Alwar 286,853, Barab-Chhabra 96,798, \nBarmer  92,203,  Bharatpur  229,807,  Bundi  94,593,  Chittaurgarh  105,212,  Churu  108,014,  Dhaulpur  110,157, \nJaisalmer  69,894,  Jhalawar  48,054  (in  2001),  Jhalapatan  30,103  (in  2001),  Karauli  75,133,  Nagaur  100,077, \nRajsamand 59,391, Sawai-Madhopur 113,545, and Sikar 199,084.  \n\n3  Alwar, Jaisalmer, and Jhalawar-Jhalapatan. \n4  Per capita water supply in the 222 towns in the state varies as follows: 40% receive less than 60 liters per capita \n\nper day (lpcd), 36% receive 60\u201380 lpcd, 14% receive 80\u2013100 lpcd, and only 10% receive more than 100 lpcd.  \n\n \n\n\f \n26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nfor \n\nand 80% of the population with access to piped water receives less than 80 lpcd. The rest get \ntheir  drinking  water  through  hand-pumps  (10%),  and  from  tube  wells  and  open  wells  (10%). \nDuring the  7 years of Investment  Program implementation, the specific target for the Program \nULBs is an increase in piped water supply coverage to 90% of the 1.4 million or so households \nin the 15 Program ULBs and a reduction of unaccounted-for water to 20% of total supply in all \nparts of the system.  \n \n4. \nUnder  the  wastewater  management  and  sanitation  policy  of  the  state,  the  goal  is  to \nprovide the entire population with basic sanitation facilities within their premises within 10 years. \nCurrently,  about  70%  of  urban  households  have  access  to  in-house  sanitation  facilities,  while \n24% (predominantly from poor households) resort to open defecation.  \n \n5. \nIn urban drainage, the goal of the state is to minimize flood risks, surface water pollution, \nand  damage  to  urban  roads  through  the  development  of  adequate  storm-water  drainage \nfacilities  in  the  cities  and  towns.  Each  ULB  is  required  to  prepare  a  comprehensive  drainage \nmaster plan that shows the optimal design and network and identifies the priority areas, with the \nnumber  of  beneficiaries,  the  probability  of  flooding,  and  the  proportion  of  slum  and  poor \nresidents.  According  to  the  2001  census,  56%  of  the  urban  population  has  access  to  open \ndrainage, and only 24% to closed drainage.  \n \n6. \nIn  solid  waste  management,  the  goal  is  to  have  all  properties  covered  by  waste \ncollection services and to meet the provisions of Municipal Solid Waste Rules (MSWR), 2000, of \nIndia,  which  prescribes  compliance  criteria \nthe  collection,  segregation,  storage, \ntransportation,  and  disposal  of  municipal  solid  waste.  The  state  also  declared  a  policy  for  the \nmanagement of solid waste and biomedical waste, consistent with the MSWR. At present, less \nthan  50%  of  solid  waste  is  collected,  house-to-house  services  are  available  to  only  35%  of \nhouseholds, and there is little or no provision for the collection and disposal of hazardous waste. \nMore  than  80%  of  the  towns  do  not  have  engineered  sanitary  landfills  and  proper  waste \nmanagement facilities.  \n \n7. \nIn  transport  and  roads,  the  policy  of  the  state  is  to  improve  operational  efficiencies \nthrough  the  construction  of  new  roads  and  roads  over  bridges  at  crucial  traffic  points,  the \nupgrading of selected roads and pedestrian facilities, and the provision of parking spaces and \npublic transport terminals as identified in the traffic management plan of the ULBs. Urban roads \nin the state are in poor condition. The road network and parking spaces are insufficient to meet \nthe  traffic  volume,  which  has  increased  significantly  in  the  last  decade.  The  growth  in  road \nnetwork  capacity  is  not  commensurate  with  increased  traffic  demand;  the  roads  are  often \ncongested with traffic. The congestion is worsened by poor road conditions and the absence of \neffective management and enforcement measures.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  Urban  Governance  Department  (UGD)  oversees  urban  development  and  local \n8. \nself-governance  in  the  state\u2019s  ULBs.  The  UGD  comprises:  (i)  the  Urban  Development  and \nHousing Department (UDHD), which oversees the functions of the Chief Town Planner\u2019s Office, \nJaipur  Development  Authority,  Rajasthan  Housing  Board,  and  nine  urban  improvement  trusts; \nand  (ii)  the  Local  Self  Government  Department  (LSGD),  which  oversees  the  functions  of  the \nDirectorate  of  Local  Bodies  (DLB),  three  municipal  corporations,  11  municipal  councils,  39 \nmunicipal  boards  (category  2),  58  municipal  boards  (category  3),  and  72  municipal  boards \n(category  4).  The  DLB  is  the  municipal  administration  arm  of  the  LSGD  and  it  oversees  the \nadministrative functions related to local self-governance, as well as the Integrated Housing and \nSlum  Development  Investment  Program  and  the  solid  waste  management  action  plan,  among \nothers.

The development of dedicated urban local authorities is still \nat  an  early  stage,  and  effective  urban  management  is  constrained  by  the  multiplicity  of \ninstitutions  with  overlapping  responsibilities.  The  functions/responsibilities  of  the  ULBs  are \ngenerally confined to solid waste management and minor roads. The ULBs have no control over \nthe  important  basic  services  of  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Water  supply  and  sanitation  is \nprovided by the government of Rajasthan (GoR)\u2019s State Public Health Engineering Department \n(PHED). Town planning and land development is a function assigned to the State authorities as \nwell as to the ULBs. These functions, currently under the Government  of Rajasthan are being \ndevolved to the ULBs.  \n \nC. \n \n\nGovernment Policies  \n\n1. \n\nNational \n\n10. \nThe  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  for  2002\u20132007  of  the  Government  of  India  recognizes \nthat the quality of urban governance and service delivery systems has a vital effect on the pace \nof  urban  development.  The  10th  FYP  supports  a  two-pronged  approach,  which  links  funds  for \ncapital investments to urban governance, finance, and service delivery reforms. The 10th FYP\u2019s \nmain reference for reform is the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1994, which creates an \nenabling framework for ULBs to play a pivotal role in urban service delivery and to be equipped \nwith  the  necessary  financial  and  administrative  powers  and  capacities.  With  the  recently \nits \nannounced  Jawarharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission \nsubcomponent  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Scheme  for  Small  and  Medium  Towns \n(UIDSSMT),  the  Government  of  India  has  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment  by  setting  aside  sizable  funds  for  fast-track  investments  in  cities,  subject  to  the \nimplementation of a range of reforms in those cities. JNNURM and UIDSSMT reiterate the need \nfor  the  states  to  empower  ULBs  to  reform  the  levy  of  user  charges,  enhance  property  tax, \nrationalize establishment costs, and improve financial management systems. It also advocates \nbalancing  asset  creation  with  asset  management,  incorporating  private  sector  efficiencies  into \nservice delivery, and making service providers financially sustainable. \n \n11. \nThe Government of India has also taken an integrated approach to poverty alleviation by \ncombining  the  National  Slum  Development  Investment  Program  and  Valmiki  Ambedkar  Awas \nYojana  (VAMBAY)  under  the  subcomponent  the  Integrated  Housing  and  Slum  Development \nInvestment Program, providing shelters and basic urban facilities in selected slum areas. \n \n\n(JNNURM)  and \n\n2. \n\nRajasthan \n\nThe  11th  FYP  (2007\u20132012)  of  the  state  projected  an  8%  growth  rate  for  the  economy \n12. \nand  focused  on  four  basic  themes:  high  growth,  equitable  growth,  human  development,  and \nreforms.  With  80%  of  plan  allocation  targeting  social  expenditure,  the  11th  FYP  aimed  at \nreducing poverty by improving access to education, health care, potable water, and sanitation. It \nalso focused on good governance as a crosscutting issue and recognized the declining role of \ngovernment  in  the  provision  of  services,  with  emphasis  on  developing  private  enterprise \nparticipation  in  public  service  delivery  and  providing  an  improved  regulatory  environment.  The \n10th  FYP  program  for  urban  development  comprised  the  planning  and  monitoring  of \ndevelopment works under the national capital region, the Integrated Development of Small and \nMedium  Towns  program,  housing  (particularly  for  the  economically  weaker  groups),  poverty \nalleviation programs, and the Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project. The Public \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nHealth  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  had  a  budget  of  Rs5,558  million  for  the  10th  FYP \nperiod, and spent Rs9,173 million.5  \n \n13. \nThe  state  government\u2019s  11th  FYP,  for  2007\u20132012,  gives  emphasis  to  addressing  the \nneeds of the rapidly developing urban population, in particular to strengthening and managing \nurban infrastructure, and implementing urban governance reforms. It identifies the key problems \nin  the  urban  area  as  (i)  poor  infrastructure;  (ii)  need  for  development  in  slum  areas;  (iii)  poor \nmanagement  of  cultural  heritage;  (iv)  growing  urban  poverty;  (v)  increase  in  pollution  and \ndepletion in groundwater resources; (vi) lack of financial resources for the ULBs; (vii) congestion \nin  class  1  urban  towns;  and  (viii)  lack  of  a  comprehensive  legal  framework  for  the  planning, \ndevelopment, and implementation of projects and schemes. It provides for the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nUrban  development.  Urban  development  and  local  self-government  with  an \noutlay  of  Rs1,517  million\u2014for  urban  planning,  promotion  of  centrally  sponsored \nschemes with emphasis on poverty alleviation, institutional and financial reforms \nthrough  the  State  Urban  Agenda  for  Rajasthan  program,  implementation  of \nlegislative  and  regulatory  frameworks,  training  and  capacity  building,  and \npromotion of public-private partnership frameworks including citizen participation \nin urban development. \n\n \n(ii)  Water supply. Water supply with an outlay of Rs40,767 million\u2014for water supply \ntariff  restructuring,  continuous  water  supply  and \nsystems  benchmarking, \nconsumer metering, water recycling/reuse and conservation, more reliable water \nsupply  and  increased  customer  satisfaction,  and  institutional  and  financial \nreforms leading to better service delivery.  \n\n \n3. \n\nOngoing Sector Reforms  \n\n \n14. \nIn  accordance  with  urban  policy  framework  of  the  Government  of  India  and  the \ngovernment  of  Rajasthan,  key  urban  sector  reforms  are  already  being  initiated  by  the  state, \nincluding land and regulatory reforms,6 and accounting reforms including (i) the adoption of the \nGovernment of India\u2019s National Accounting Manual and the announcement of the State Policy \non Accounting Reforms, 2004; (ii) the scheduled conversion of the accounting systems of 183 \nULBs  to  double-entry  accounting;  and  (iii)  the  launch  of  the  E-Nagar  Mitra  Project,7  an \ne-governance  and  accounting  reform  initiative.  Financial  reforms  include  (i) substitution  of \nproperty  tax  and  land  bank  management;  (ii)  revenue-enhancing  measures;  (iii)  promotion  of \npublic-private  partnerships  and  citizen  participation  in  urban  development,8  addressing  the \nneeded  professionalization  of  services;  and  (iv)  provision  of  access  for  ULBs  to  institutional \nfinance through the Rajasthan Urban Development Fund (RUDF).9 \n                                                 \n5  The state suffered a drought during the 10th FYP period (from 2002 to 2004) but the PHED undertook significant \nefforts to provide  water to all urban centers. Major projects comprised  water supply reorganization, rehabilitation, \nand augmentation in almost 50% of the urban centers. \n\n6  The  following  bills  are  being  considered:  (i)  Rajasthan  Municipalities  Bill,  2005;  (ii)  Rajasthan  Prevention  of \n\nDefacement of Properties Bill, 2006; and (iii) Rajasthan Heritage Conservation Bill, 2006.  \n\n7  Recognizing the success of Lok Mitra (one-stop utility service payment in urban centers of Jaipur, Ajmer, Bikaner, \nand  Udaipur)  and  Jan  Mitra  (rural  service  delivery  system),  the  IT  Department  is  now  designing  an  ambitious \nproject called E-Nagar Mitra. This project seeks to integrate the features of Lok Mitra and Jan Mitra, and will bring \ntogether various services offered by different departments and provide a unified e-services platform, minimizing the \ninteraction points for citizens. More than 60 departmental services will be provided through the project\u2019s counters. \n8  A  subgroup  on  urban  governance  in  the  Economic  Policy  and  Reform  Council  is  currently  reviewing: \n(i) public-private  partnerships  and  citizen  participation  in  urban  development;  (ii)  the  solid  waste  management \naction plan; and (iii) housing policy and institutional finance. \n\n9  The  government  of  Rajasthan,  through  the  Local  Self  Government  Department,  established  the  RUDF  in \nNovember  2006  to  address  the  need  to  attract  large  fund  flows  into  the  urban  development  sector.  RUDF  is \npositioned to facilitate the development and financing of urban infrastructure in the state\u2019s ULBs. Created under the \n\n \n\n\f \n30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n \n15. \nThe  state  government  has  also  been  building  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  and \ncivil  society,  particularly  through  the  Economic  Policy  and  Reforms  Council  (EPRC)  set  up  in \n2004.  The  EPRC,  comprising  the  chief  executive  officers  of  leading  corporations,  human \nresource  development  specialists,  and  economists,  has  prepared  an  important  agenda  of \nreforms. The reforms are intended to attract private investment, enhance the capabilities of the \nlabor  force  through  human  development,  build  infrastructure,  and  improve  fiscal  health  to \nprovide  resources  for  development.  Although  the  government  of  Rajasthan  has  begun \nimplementing  several  of  these  reforms,  much  remains  to  be  done  and  there  is  a  need  to  set \npriorities. \n \nD. \n \nADB\u2019s  overall  strategic  direction  in  India  has  been  to  assist  the  country  in  promoting \n16. \nefficient  and  sustainable  economic  growth  to  increase  employment  opportunities  and  reduce \npoverty.  By  supporting  the  development  of  urban  infrastructure,  providing  long-term  funds  for \nhousing  finance,  and  developing  sustainable  mechanisms  for  the  delivery  of  social  services, \nADB  is  increasingly  integrating  social  welfare  concerns  into  its  strategy.  Through  its  technical \nassistance  and  lending  investment  programs,  ADB  also  promotes  policy  reform  measures  to \naddress the legal, institutional, and financial problems facing India\u2019s urban sector. These reform \nmeasures  will  liberalize  India\u2019s  land  and  housing  markets  to  attract  more  private  investments. \nADB\u2019s  urban  sector  assistance  emphasizes  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening \ninitiatives to promote sustainable urban management. \n \n17. \nOver the medium term, ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy for India calls for continued support \nfor  integrated  urban  development  projects  in  an  effort  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and \nliving  conditions,  especially  of  the  urban  poor,  and  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  ULBs  to \nimplement  projects  and  deliver  services.  Further,  urban  projects  in  India  are  demand-driven, \nwith  key  criteria  being  the  ULBs\u2019  willingness  to  initiate  policy  reform  measures  as  part  of \nADB-financed  projects.  The  absorptive  capacity  of  ULBs  is  reflected  in  the  overall  design  of \nintegrated urban development projects. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of using \nprojects as a means of gaining valuable local experience for improving project implementation \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  capabilities.  Thus,  to  the  extent  possible,  project \nexecution  should  be  through  existing  institutions,  particularly  ULBs.  ADB-funded  integrated \nurban  development  projects  are  also  used  to  introduce  and  implement  different  cost  recovery \nmechanisms  and  privatization  measures,  especially  for  water  supply  subprojects,  to  ensure \nfinancial  sustainability.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  gives  importance  to  incorporating  in  investment \nprograms  appropriately  designed  plans  for  building  community  awareness  and  participation. \nInnovative  approaches  to  community  and  beneficiary  participation,  particularly  by  low-income \nhouseholds,  are  recognized  as  essential  for  sustainable  and  replicable  projects.  The  focus  on \nthe  urban  poor  goes  beyond  infrastructure:  a  holistic  approach  to  meeting  their  needs  and \nempowering them to improve their own living conditions is prescribed, including the use of self-\nhelp schemes and the careful application of cross-subsidies. \n \nE. \n \nThere have so far been only a few large-scale external assistance projects in the urban \n18. \nsector  of  Rajasthan.  The  ongoing  ADB-financed  project,  the  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure \n\nExternal Assistance to the Urban Sector in Rajasthan \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nIndian Trust Act, 1882, RUDF was formed with an initial Rs50 million and is currently managed by the Rajasthan \nUrban  Infrastructure  Finance  and  Development  Corporation,  an  asset  management  company  and  a  state-owned \npublic sector unit.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nimprovement, \n\nDevelopment Project (RUIDP),10 is the first major external assistance to Rajasthan. Its objective \nis to optimize social and economic development in urban Rajasthan by facilitating policy reforms \nthat  will  strengthen  urban  management,  and  by  supporting  priority  investments  in  urban \ninfrastructure and services to meet basic human needs, improve the quality of life, and stimulate \nsustainable  social  and  economic  development.  Policy  reforms  include  (i)  local  resource \ngeneration and improved municipal management, (ii) improved cost recovery for water supply, \n(iii)  capacity  building  for  municipal  government,  (iv)  establishment  of  an  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  finance  facility,  and  (v)  community  participation.  Additionally,  RUIDP  covers \nthe  provision  of  urban  services  in  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  and  wastewater \ntransport,  heritage  conservation, \nmanagement,  slum  and  environmental \nstrengthening of firefighting services, and other civic services. RUIDP is being implemented in \nsix ULBs\u2014Jaipur, Ajmer, Udaipur, Kota, Bikaner, and Jodhpur\u2014and has earned a satisfactory \nrating  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Financial  Information  System11  report.  ADB  also  provided  technical \nassistance12 for the preparation of the proposed Investment Program and the detailed design of \nsome subprojects to jump-start the implementation of the Investment Program. \n \nThe  Rajasthan  Health  Systems  Development  Project  (RHSDP)13  funded  by  the  World \n19. \nBank  involves  the  upgrading  and  renovation  of  district  hospitals,  public  health  centers,  and \ndivisional  headquarters  hospitals;  the  provision  of  medical  equipment;  training  for  medical \nofficials;  and  an  information,  education,  and  communication  program.  The  RHSDP  is  being \nimplemented  in  all  the  districts  of  Rajasthan.  It  is  being  implemented  in  the  ULBs  of  Tonk, \nBaran,  Jhalawar,  Dausa,  Dhaulpur,  Churu,  and  Bundi.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation is supporting the Jaipur Water Supply from Bisalpur Dam Project,14 which involves \nthe  main  lines,  pumping  stations,  reservoirs,  and  water  supply  systems  of  Jaipur  city,  among \nother  things.  The  European  Commission  is  supporting  the  European  Commission  State \nPartnership  Program  (ECSPP).15  The  ECSPP  is  focused  on  water  management  including  the \nmanagement of surface water and groundwater. ADB is providing technical assistance16 to India \nfor  mainstreaming  Public-Private  Partnership  (PPP)  at  central  and  state  levels.  The  TA  is \nmobilizing  existing  resources  in  the  Government  in  support  of  PPP  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment. Under this TA, a PPP cell has been established in Rajasthan. \n\n                                                 \n10 The  total  project  cost  is  $250  million.  The  project  implementation  period  was  originally  from  March  2000  to \nMarch 2009  but  the  loan  closing  date  was  extended  from  June  2006  to  31  March  2008  after  the  inclusion  of  the \nBisalpur Water Supply Transmission Project. \n\n11 ADB. 2006.

Besides  their  most  evident  impact\u2014\nimproved living conditions and quality of life for urban dwellers\u2014such projects have longer-term \neconomic benefits arising from the overall improvement in living conditions.  \n \nTo  the  state  executing  agencies,  ADB  assistance  is  much  more  than  filling  the  gap  in \n2. \nfunding  for  the  construction  or  rehabilitation  of  urban  infrastructure.  The  assistance  gives  the \nstate  governments  the  opportunity  to  (i)  get  long-term  capacity  development  support  during \nproject  implementation  (5\u20137  years);  (ii)  apply  more  transparency  and  higher  standards  in \nprocurement;  and  (iii)  focus  on  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  of  urban  services, \nensuring the sustainability of urban projects.  \n \n3. \nThe  goal  of  improving  basic  urban  services  has  been  translated  into  actions  through \nmostly  integrated  urban  projects  combining  infrastructure  development  and  environmental \nimprovements  with  targeted  poverty  reduction,  urban  institutional  reforms,  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  Despite  the  noble  goal,  however,  the  implementation  of  urban  projects  has  not \nbeen without problems. In fact, significant delays have been common because integrated urban \ndevelopment  projects  are  inherently  complex  and  their  implementation  requires  close \ncoordination between several agencies, enhanced institutional capacity, and public support. The \nresulting  time  and  cost  overruns  have  been  found  to  be  too  costly,  despite  the  proven \nadvantage  of  the  integrated  design  of  urban  projects.  As  a  result,  a  new  framework  was \ndeveloped  and  agreed  for  stronger  ownership  of  the  projects  by  the  state  and  municipal \ngovernments  at  an  early  stage  of  project  design  and  implementation.  The  new  framework \nincludes up-front capacity development of implementing agencies and institutional strengthening \nof  state  line  departments  to  reduce  start-up  delays  and  strengthen  the  focus  on  integrating \nlessons  learned  from  earlier  urban  development  projects.  The  key  lessons  learned  and \nmeasures included in the Investment Program design are summarized below.  \n \n4. \nLonger-Term  Assistance.  It  is  difficult  to  achieve  the  intended  impact,  especially  in \nurban governance and management improvement, through a single intervention. ADB projects \nhave  been  instrumental  in  building  stronger  state  nodal  agencies  in  the  urban  sector.  For \nexample,  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Finance  Corporation,  an  executing \nagency  for  two  ADB-financed  projects,  emerged  as  a  nodal  agency  for  the  development, \nfinancing,  and  implementation  of  urban  projects.  It  prepared  the  third  loan  from  ADB  without \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance.  Similarly,  the  project  management  unit  of  Rajasthan \nUrban  Infrastructure  Development  Project  (RUIDP)  I  can  now  carry  out  most  of  the  advance \nactions for the Investment Program without detailed supervision from ADB. To be effective, ADB \nassistance  should  be  made  over  a  longer  term,  through  successive  loans  to  the  beneficiary \nstate.  \n  \n5. \nStart-Up Delays. As indicated earlier, there were abnormal delays in initial activities by \nthe executing agencies (EAs) during the project start-up period. It was apparent that the support \nof consultants would be required not just during detailed engineering design and supervision but \nalso  during  project  preparation.  Earlier,  in  the  absence  of  retroactive  financing,  state \ngovernments  had  to  wait  for  the  loans  to  be  signed  and  take  effect  before  mobilizing \nconsultants. For this very reason, under RUIDP, it took 18 months to appoint loan consultants \nafter  loan  signing.  Such  initial  delays  in  the  appointment  of  consultants  considerably  affects \nsubsequent  project  implementation  since  the  preparation  of  generic  prequalification  and \nstandard  bidding  documents,  detailed  engineering  surveys,  and  preparation  of  specific  tender \ndocuments  take  place  only  after  the  loan  consultants  are  in  place.  As  a  result,  in  the  case  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nRUIDP,  it  took  another  year  after  the  appointment  of  the  consultants,  or  more  than  2.5  years \nafter the loan was signed, to award the first major civil works contract.  \n \n6. \nTo overcome these start-up delays, extensive discussions and reviews were carried out \nin  2003\u20132004  for  urban  sector  projects  in  India.  On  the  borrower\u2019s  side,  it  was  agreed  that  a \ndedicated  project  management  unit  would  be  set  up  during  project  appraisal.  Unlike \nexperienced national agencies such as the National Highway Authority of India or other central \npublic  sector  undertakings,  state  governments  and  local  urban  bodies  do  not  have  dedicated \nproject  management  units  at  the  time  of  project  appraisal.  ADB  for  its  part  agreed  to  provide \nsupport to the EAs in: (i) establishing project management and implementation units far ahead \nof  loan  effectiveness;  (ii) strengthening  the  managerial  and  institutional  capabilities  of  such \nunits; (iii) assisting in the preparation of tender documents, the selection of consultants, and the \nprequalification  of  contractors;  (iv) familiarizing project  staff  with  ADB  policies  and procedures; \nand  (v) ensuring  a  strong  sense  of  ownership  by  the  state  and  municipal  governments,  and \npromoting public participation. Therefore, a bridging technical assistance (TA), advance actions, \nand  the  strengthening  of  institutions  responsible  for  project  implementation  have  been \nincorporated in the Investment Program to avoid start-up delays.  \n \n7. \nProject Readiness. Project readiness, in terms of not only the advance setting up and \nstaffing of the project management unit and project implementation units but also actions toward \nthe attainment of land and regulatory clearances for the sites, is very important for the speedy \nimplementation  of  projects.  Of  particular  concern  is  land  acquisition,  which  is  normally  the \nprimary  cause  of  delay  in  implementing  urban  infrastructure  projects.  Under  RUIDP,  great \ndifficulties  in  land  acquisition  were  experienced  during  implementation,  particularly  for  the \nsewage  treatment  plants  (STPs).  For  instance,  due  to  legal  issues  related  to  land  acquisition, \nthe  STP  in  Udaipur  had  to  be  dropped  from  the  project.  Similarly,  the  implementation  of \nactivities  in  Ajmer  was  substantially  delayed  by  land  acquisition  for  the  STP.  Similarly,  the \nprocess  of  obtaining  statutory  and  other  approvals  from  concerned  authorities,  such  as  the \npollution control  boards  and  national  highway  or  railway  authorities, causes  delays  and  hence \nneeds to begin before loan approval. Such actions have already started for the subprojects and \nsites  under  the  first  tranche  of  the  Investment  Program,  and  the  investment  program \nmanagement unit (IPMU) has been established as well. During preparation of the RUSDIP, the \nauthorities have displayed a considerable sense of ownership and reform momentum.  \n \nChange  in  Scope.  Urban  development  projects  often  undergo  changes  in  scope  to \n8. \nrespond  to  the  evolving  needs  of  the  urban  communities.  Changes  in  scope,  processing,  and \npreparation  in  earlier  projects  in  Rajasthan  and  Karnataka,  particularly  in  the  assessment  of \ncompliance  with  safeguards,  further  delayed  project  implementation.  Therefore,  the  scope  of \neach  loan  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  well  defined  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders.  \n \n9. \nTariff  Reforms.  Even  small  changes  generally  take  years  to  incorporate  in  tariff \nstructures  and  reforms,  and  there  is  a  need  for  modest  but  focused  incremental  reforms.  In \nparticular, policy changes such as increases in water supply and sewerage tariffs are likely to be \nmore acceptable if these are preceded by infrastructure development, improvement of services, \nand  extensive  stakeholder  consultations.  Under  the  Investment  Program,  the  rationalization  of \ntariffs  is  proposed  to  be  introduced  in  accordance  with  JNNURM  principles.  Additional \nawareness-raising  campaigns  will  be  undertaken  and  extensive  stakeholder  consultations  will \ncontinue during the implementation of the Program.  \n \n10.  Market-Based  Cost  Estimates  and  Minimization  of  Contract  Packages.  Cost \nestimates in urban projects are generally based on the standard schedule of rates (SOR). The \nSOR,  normally  developed  for  much  smaller  works  and  not  updated  regularly,  is  therefore  an \ninadequate foundation for estimating costs for large-scale urban infrastructure projects. As was \n\n \n\n\f \n34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nfound  in  RUIDP  as  well  as  other  urban  development  projects,  the  prices  obtained  through \ncompetitive  bidding  can  be  significantly  different  from  the  cost  estimates  (by  35\u201375%  in  many \ncases), necessitating negotiation, cancellation and re-bidding, and repackaging. Therefore, it is \nproposed  that  a  basic  schedule  of  rates  (BSR)  based  on  the  index  of  basic  materials  like \ncement,  steel,  and  pipes,  be  prepared  for  the  Investment  Program.  The  BSR,  to  be  updated \nevery  6  months  to  reflect  market  fluctuations  and  inflation,  will  be  used  in  preparing  cost \nestimates  for  the  subprojects  under  the  Program.  This  mechanism  of  reflecting  the  cost \nestimates on updated market based rates will facilitate implementation and the management of \ncontracts  by  reducing  bid  processing  delays  and  the  variations  that  are  often  observed  in  the \nimplementation of urban projects. Similarly, to minimize the number of contracts and maximize \ncontractor  and  market  participation,  measures  such  as  combining  the  procurement  of  similar \nequipment (for example, bulk water meters, pump machineries, solid waste equipment) will be \ncentralized, and  contract  packages,  such  as  the  design  and  construction  of  sewage  treatment \nplants, will be combined for neighboring urban local bodies (ULBs) eligible for funding under the \nInvestment Program. \n \n11. \nCapacity  Building  of  ULBs  to  Manage  the  Assets.  Capacity  building  and  staffing  of \nULBs  with  enough  resources  to  run  and  maintain  the  completed  project  facilities  generally \nreceived  limited  attention.  To  address  this  issue  and  maximize  the  sustainability  of  assets \ncreated  under  the  Investment  Program,  a  draft  institutional  and  capacity  development  plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  N)  has  been  prepared  by  the  bridging  TA  consultants,  and  will  be \nfurther developed by the IPMU with the support of loan consultants. Furthermore, the design of \nthe  implementation  structure  of  the  Investment  Program  took  into  careful  consideration  the \nnumber of subsectors and subprojects, and the absorptive as well as implementation capacity of \nthe EA and the ULBs. \n \n12. \nFocus on Stakeholder Involvement. Under RUIDP, the community action participation \nprogram  (CAPP),  which  was  to  promote  community  awareness  and  the  involvement  of  local \ncommunities in the project, did not start when the project was first implemented. Therefore, the \ncommunities  did  not  participate  in  the  planning,  and  felt  excluded  from  the  project  benefits. \nFurthermore, community awareness activities should have focused more on advocacy, i.e., on \npayment  for  improved  service  facilities,  to  ensure  that  urban  dwellers  understood  the \nimportance  of  user  charges  for  the  sustainability  of  project  activities.  Finally,  in  RUIDP  the \ncommunity  infrastructure  improvements  proposed  by  local  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  took  too  long  to  be  approved,  such  that  most  were  never  approved.  The  Investment \nProgram  design  includes  the  implementation  of  CAPP  activities  at  the  start  of  Program \nimplementation,  extensive  awareness-raising  activities  and  emphasis  has  been  placed  on \nsimplified procedures.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES, BY EXPENDITURE CATEGORY AND FINANCIER  \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nADB \n\n \n% \n\n \n% \n\nLocal \n\nLocal \n\nForeign \n\nForeign \n\nSubtotal A \n\n \nTotal \n\n \nTotal \n\n0.0 \n1.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\nGovernment of Rajasthan \n\nSubtotal B \nSubtotal (A) \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n1.6 \n\nTotal  Exchange  Currency \n\n91.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n0.0 \n90.0 \n\n205.9 \n1.8 \n1.0 \n0.0 \n208.7 \n\n205.9 \n0.2 \n1.0 \n0.0 \n207.1 \n\n226.2 \n1.8 \n1.0 \n2.5 \n231.4 \n\n1.

There are 32 districts in the state of Rajasthan. The \noperational selection criteria used in the selection of ULBs for funding under the Rajasthan Urban \nSector Development Investment Program (the Investment Program) are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  ULB  contributes  to  the  subproject  no  less  than  10%  of  the  related  cost  on \naverage. \nThe  ULB  is  either  the  district  headquarters  of  a  district  or  a  town  with  tourism \nimportance,  which  has  been  identified  as  such  in  the  state\u2019s  tourism  policy  or  has \nmore than 50,000 tourist visitors yearly. \nThe  population  of  the  ULB  is  more  than  50,000,  except  for  twin  towns  sharing \nresources and management responsibilities for their urban services. \nThe ULB has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government on \nthe  implementation  of  the  institutional  and  financial  improvement  action  plan  as \noutlined in Appendix 13.  \n\nSelection of Subprojects \n\n \n2. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  above  criteria,  15  ULBs  were  initially  selected  for  support  under  the \nInvestment Program, which include 4 municipal councils and 12 municipal boards of category 2.1 \nOther ULBs that meet the above selection criteria may be subsequently included in the Investment \nProgram if additional financial resources become available through budget savings. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe state, through the Executing Agency, will ensure that civil works for all subprojects will \nbe  synchronized  with  civil  works  for  sewerage,  water  supply  pipe  laying,  and  drainage  as \nappropriate. \n \n4. \nIn  accordance  with  the  objectives  and  targets  set  under  the  Investment  Program,  the \nsubprojects  eligible  for  financing  under  the  Investment  Program  will  have  the  following \ncomponents:2  (i)  water  supply;  (ii)  environmental  sanitation,  including  wastewater  management, \nsolid  waste  management,  and  urban  drainage;  (iii)  urban  transport  and  roads;  (iv)  social \ninfrastructure, including slum Improvements; and (v) infrastructure support for cultural heritage.  \n \n5. \nEach ULB will prepare a city-level investment plan (CLIP), which may include all or some of \nthe  foregoing  components.  The  CLIP  will  be  based  on  the  following,  among  others:  the  current \nlevel of services, the needs and preferences of stakeholders, the financial and institutional capacity \nof the ULB, and the norms and standards prescribed by the state government and the Government \nof  India.  In  selecting  subprojects  for  each  ULB,  the  following  aspects  should  be  checked  and \nensured by Rajasthan\u2019s work finalization committee: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe works proposed under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small \nand  Medium  Towns  or  any  other  scheme  of  the  Government  of  India,  and  state \nschemes  containing  grant  funding,  should  not  be  included  under  the  Investment \nProgram. \n\n                                                 \n1  Municipal boards in ULBs with a population of 20,001\u2013100,000; municipal councils in ULBs with a population or more \n\n2  The  Facility  will  also  cover  implementation  support,  capacity  development,  and  a  community  action  participation \n\nprogram. There are no selection criteria for this institution-building component.  \n\nthan 100,000. \n\n \n\n\f \n38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  line  agencies  or  responsible  authorities  must  have  agreed  to  take  over  the \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  assets  created  under  the  Investment  Program, \nand to allocate an adequate budget for them. \nThe concerned line agencies must provide hindrance-free land to the Implementing \nAgency for the execution of works. \nThe proposed investment plans under the City Development Plan must demonstrate \nthat  the  ULB  can  mobilize  the  financial  resources  required  for  the  O&M  of  all  the \nassets under the ULB\u2019s mandate created under the Investment Program. \nThe total cost of all the subprojects in each ULB should not exceed $250 per person \nbut can be higher in ULBs of tourism importance with a low population. \nAll  subprojects  must  have  prepared  resettlement  plans,  if  required,  in  accordance \nwith the resettlement framework of the Investment Program. \nAll subprojects must meet the environmental subproject selection guidelines (Annex \n1)  and  have  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental \nmonitoring  plans  with  adequate  budgets  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework of the Investment Program. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  All  subprojects  must  have  prepared  indigenous  peoples  development  plans,  if \nrequired, in accordance with the indigenous peoples development framework of the \nInvestment Program. \nProposals  related  to  the  provision  of  urban  services  in  notified  slum  areas  must \npertain  to  areas  (a) where  residents  have  secure  tenure;

The population growth rate \nin  Rajasthan  was  28%  in  1991\u20132001,  higher  than  the  national  growth  rate  of  21.3%  during  the  same  period.  The \nurbanization level in the state increased from 17.6% in the 1971 census to 23.4% (13.2 million) of the total population in \nthe 2001 census, slightly lower than the national average of 27.8%, and it is expected to reach 26.1% (22.8 million) by \n2021. The population living below the poverty line has decreased significantly, from 27.4% in 1994, to 15.2% in 2000. \nAccording to a recent survey by the government of Rajasthan, the percentage of the population living below the poverty \nline (BPL) increased slightly to 19% in 2004. In contrast to the national trend, Rajasthan\u2019s urban poverty level is higher \nthan the rural poverty level. In 1994, the rural poor constituted 26.4% and the urban poor 30.4%, and in 2000 the rural \npoor made up 13.7% and the urban poor 19.8%. Higher urban poverty rates and an expanding urban population may, \nin  the  coming  years,  lead  to  an  urban  crisis  already  compounded  by  lack  of  water  and  a  stagnant  manufacturing \nindustry. It is also important to note that a large group of people remain just above the statistical cut-off poverty line. A \nrecent report by The World Bank observes that raising the relevant income poverty line by 10% would raise the urban \npoverty level by 34% and rural poverty by 20% at the aggregate national level.  \n \nAdditionally, income poverty does not accurately reflect all the dimensions of poverty in Rajasthan. The transient nature \nof  poverty  in  Rajasthan,  due  to  natural  disasters,  makes  the  condition  of  the  poor  particularly  precarious.  Frequent \ndrought and the resulting large-scale out-migration in search of employment have a severe impact on the poor that is \nnot  reflected  in  a  quantitative  assessment.  Furthermore,  income  poverty  hides  many  other  dimensions  of  human \nsuffering, which are accentuated by ecological factors and inadequate provisioning of basic amenities.  \n \nThe slowdown in growth since the end of the 1990s is threatening the state\u2019s prospects for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs).  Rajasthan  seems  on  the  way  to  achieving  the  goals  for  primary  education  and \nenvironmental sustainability, if growth rates and other conditions remain favorable, but the state is unlikely to succeed \nin achieving the goals of reducing infant and child mortality and providing reproductive health services for all. The state \nhas made remarkable progress in primary education: the primary gross enrollment ratio increased from 89% in 1993 to \n97%  in  2002  and  to  more  than  100%  in  2004.  On  the  other  hand,  health  indicators  are  behind  those  for  the  rest  of \nIndia, as highlighted by the fact the underweight children per 1,000 and under-5 mortality per 1,000 actually increased, \nrather  than  decreased,  in  the  1990s.  Since  human  development/social  indicators  are  closely  correlated  with  income, \neconomic recovery is highly relevant to the achievement of the MDGs.  \n \nThe  Rajasthan  Urban  Sector  Development  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  address  basic  needs  deficiencies \nthroughout 15 medium-sized cities and boost the regional economy through improved urban services. Direct benefits \nwill be sustained improvements in basic services in all Investment Program ULBs. The Investment Program will have a \npositive impact on the poor. Safe drinking water is a basic need that is inaccessible to a significant number of the poor \nin Rajasthan. The Program and the facilities to be built or improved under it will reduce the burden of water collection \non vulnerable  segments of the population such as  women. Free  water connections and lifeline tariffs  will ensure that \nthe poor can afford clean drinking water. Improvements in the quality of water, sewage treatment, sanitation, and solid \nwaste  management  will  lead  to  public  health  improvements  and  hence  to  reductions  in  the  burden  of  diseases, \ntreatment cost, and productive losses, whose impact is felt by the poor in particular. Women, especially poor women, \nwill  benefit  from  the  reduction  in  the  time  and  energy  spent  in  fetching  and  storing  water,  and  in  the  work  burden \nassociated  with  cleaning  and  family  health  care.  The  spin-offs  are  expected  to  be  economic  growth  and  direct \nemployment in unskilled or construction work under the Investment Program. \n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n \n\nPoverty Classification: Targeted intervention (MDGs) \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA  baseline  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  in  three  of  the  Investment  Program  towns  (Alwar,  Jaisalmer  and \nJhalawar-Jhalapatan). The poverty analysis was drawn from primary and secondary data. Primary data collection relied \non both a quantitative (1,650 sample households) survey and qualitative participatory exercises with slum dwellers and \nstakeholders throughout the cities. \n \nEven though progress in access to improved water and sanitation in urban areas is on track in Rajasthan in terms of \nachieving the MDGs, significant urban population growth rates and unequal distribution of basic urban services in urban \nareas  may  cause  a  setback  in  achieving  the  MDGs.  According  to  the  baseline  socioeconomic  survey,  the  population \nliving below the poverty line (BPL) was 18% in Alwar, 8% in Jaisalmer, and 25.9% in Jhalawar-Jhalapatan. The slum \npopulation ranged from4.1%  in Jhalawar-Jhalapatan and 6.8% in Alwar, to 26.5%  in Jaisalmer. The survey identified \nthe poor quality of urban environmental infrastructure and a gap in basic urban services, particularly for the poor living \nin slum areas.   \n \nThe  social  and  poverty  analysis  showed  widespread  deficiencies  in  basic  urban  services  in  the  three  cities.  Around \n76% of households in slums in Jaisalmer do not have access to water service connections. Although public stand posts \nexist, issues of water pressure and frequency and duration of supply are major issues for the poor. The survey revealed \nthat in Jaisalmer, water is supplied through the stand posts only once or twice a week. In summer, slum dwellers have \nto look for drinking water in other colonies with no certainty of getting it. More than 70% of slum households in the three \ntowns  do  not  have  private  toilets  and  60%  practice  open  defecation.  Drainage  systems  do  not  exist  in  Jhalawar  and \nJhalapatan,  while  in  Alwar  drainage  systems  are  availably  only  in  a  limited  area.  In  Jaisalmer,  only  2%  of  poor \nhouseholds  reportedly  have  drainage  connections.  Lack  of  drainage,  resulting  in  regular  waterlogging  and  flooding \nduring  rains,  was  reported  by  24%  slum  dwellers  in  Jhalawar,  and  for  62%  of  the  slum  population  in  all  three  towns \nsolid  waste  is  not  collected  regularly.  Solid  waste  disposal  is  usually  on  nearby  roads  or  roadside  drains  because  of \npoor  municipal  waste  collection  and  disposal.  With  this  low  access  to  basic  services,  waterborne  diseases  such  as \ndiarrhea,  enteric  fever,  and  viral  hepatitis  are  significant  in  the  towns.  The  prevalence  of  diarrhea  among  the  poor  is \n41% in Jaisalmer and 46% in Alwar. Deficiencies in environmental sanitation are the cause of waterborne diseases, a \nmajor contributor to high levels of morbidity and mortality. Thus, the control of these diseases needs to be addressed \nthrough improved sanitation and supply of safe drinking water.  \n \nThe provision of good-quality and sustainable services to promote economic development and reduce poverty will rely \non support from the Investment Program in building the capacity of the urban local bodies to plan and manage more \neffectively. The Investment Program will improve capacity to plan, develop, and operate pro-poor urban infrastructure \nand  services  on  the  basis  of  an  improved  understanding  of  poverty  and  processes  of  participatory  planning  and \ndevelopment.  \n \nPoverty and social analysis using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques is required to gauge post\u2013\nInvestment Program benefits in terms of improved access to basic services by the poor. The baseline survey will serve \nas  the  benchmark  against  which  post\u2013Investment  Program  impact  on  the  poor  may  be  measured.  Benefits  to  poor \nhouseholds,  benefits  to  women,  and  increased  participation  and  capacity  building  of  the  poor  including  women  are \nsome of the issues that must be monitored and measured during and after implementation. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nExtensive  consultations  have  been  undertaken  with  stakeholders  including:  beneficiary  communities  and  affected \nhouseholds  (among  these,  vulnerable  households  such  as  poor  households  and  those  headed  by  women  or \nindigenous  persons),  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  self-help  groups  (SHGs),  elected \nrepresentatives  (such  as  municipal  board  members),  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs),  administrative  departments,  state \ngovernments, and the central Government. Consultation workshops, meetings, focus group discussions, and structured \ninterviews were undertaken with stakeholders.  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was specifically undertaken for the slum upgrading subprojects and other subprojects aimed at \nbenefiting  the  poor.  Key  stakeholders  identified  were  poor  communities,  slum  dwellers,  NGOs,  self-help  groups,  the \nstate  government,  and  ULBs.  The  perceptions  of  the  poor  were  obtained  through  FGDs,  individual  interviews,  and \ngroup meetings. These perceptions were considered in the Investment Program design.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nExtensive information dissemination and consultations have been undertaken to ensure stakeholder participation in the \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n \n\n47\n\nInvestment  Program  design.  During  Investment  Program  preparation,  it  was  noted  that  a  key  factor  in  the \nnonperformance  of  many  poverty  reduction  investment  programs  was  lack  of  participation  from  the  poor.  A  major \nfeature of the capacity development subcomponent of the Investment Program is enabling the municipal bodies to take \na  more  participatory  approach  to  urban  development.  This  will  start  with  the  detailed  planning,  design,  and \nimplementation  of  the  Investment  Program.  Implementation  support  includes  the  provision  of  social  and  community \ndevelopment experts within the IPMU and IPIUs and the conduct of community awareness programs by NGOs: (i) to \nexplain the Investment Program activities; (ii) to serve as a continuing consultation mechanism, particularly for service \ncharges and fees; (iii) to launch community education programs in health and hygiene and water use management; and \n(iv) to provide a channel of communication on concerns and complaints, for issues arising during construction, such as \ndisruption  or  damage  caused.  Ongoing  consultation  and  participatory  monitoring  will  help  ensure  that  the  Investment \nProgram  meets  the  needs  of  the  community.  The  consultations  can  take  the  form  of  annual  surveys  by  consumer \ncategory,  combined  with  community  forums  or  focus  group  discussions.  The  media  for  this  public  information \nmechanism will include local television, radio, newsletters, websites, and community meetings. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize beneficial impacts on women: \nPrimary  and  secondary  information  has  been  analyzed  to  assess  the  status  of  women  in  Investment  Program  ULBs. \nWhile there are significant differences in the status of women in the different Investment Program ULBs, the trends are \ncommon. In terms of education the female literacy rate is lower the rate for men. Social, economic, and cultural barriers \nprevent poor women from obtaining easy access to health services and care, even when good-quality health services \nare geographically within reach.  \n \nThe lack of basic urban infrastructure and services affects women more than men. Because of women\u2019s primary role in \nmanaging the household, the burden of water collection falls on them. During Investment Program preparation it was \nnoted  that  water  collection  takes  3\u20134  hours  per  day  for  women.  This  reduces  the  time  they  have  to  engage  in \nproductive activities that would increase household income and improve women\u2019s position within the households. Lack \nof  clean  water  supply  also  burdens  women,  who  handle  water  more  than  men.  Women  have  higher  exposure  to \ndiseases  from  contaminated  water  in  the  process  of  collecting  water,  and  using  water  in  cooking  and  washing.  A \nreduction in diseases, aside from reducing the costs of treatment and productivity losses, also reduces the burden of \ncaring  for  sick  household  members  which,  is  often  a  role  taken  on  by  women  in  the  household.  The  lack  of  toilet \nfacilities also has a large impact on women in terms of privacy. The Investment Program responds to these issues in \nthe design of its subprojects.  \n  \n \nE.

A \nresettlement framework has been prepared to \nguide the implementation of subprojects and short \nresettlement plans (RPs) have been prepared for \nsample subprojects. \nThe potential negative impact of water tariff \nincreases on the poor is considered to be \nacceptable, at less than 4\u20135% of household \nincome, and given that the poor pay a higher than \naverage proportion of their incomes on water at \npresent. A consumption-based tariff will entail a \nhigher charge on high-consuming (and possibly \nalso higher-income) households. The same \nprinciple applies to the sewerage component, for \nwhich a surcharge is computed on water bills. \nConnection charges for water and sewerage \nwould require a subsidy from the municipal bodies \nfor BPL families. \nNo job loss will occur. The construction and \noperation of the project may generate employment \nopportunities for local people. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n Full \n\n Short  \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nItem \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \nLabor \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n \n\nItem \n \n \nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nIn the three sample towns, initial screening for \nimpact on indigenous peoples (IPs) showed no \nsignificant impact on IPs.

The Investment Program will also \nprovide  policy  reforms  to  strengthen  urban  governance,  management,  and  support  for  urban \ninfrastructure and services.2 \n \n2. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpact.  Subprojects  involving  rehabilitation  will  be  accommodated  within  the  existing  facilities\u2019 \npremises  and  will  not  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Subprojects  involving  the \nconstruction  of  water  supply  systems,  sewerage  systems,  solid  waste  management  systems, \nurban  drainage,  and  transport  and  road  facilities  are  proposed  on  vacant  government  land \nwherever possible. The overall impact will be further minimized through careful subproject siting \nand alignment during detailed design and subproject implementation. Short resettlement plans \n(RPs) were prepared for sample subprojects in three towns (Supplementary Appendix H).3 \n \n\nResettlement Framework and Policy \n\nB. \n \n3. \nThis summary provides highlights of the resettlement framework (RF). The RF outlines \nthe objectives, policy principles, and procedures for land acquisition (if required), compensation, \nand other assistance measures for affected persons (APs). The RF is based on national laws \nincluding  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  (amended  in  1984);  and  the  National  Policy  on \nResettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Persons, 2003 (NRRP). It is also based on \nthe  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  RF \ncompares these documents and addresses gaps.  \n \n4. \nThe  core  involuntary  resettlement  principles  for  the  Investment  Program  are:  (i)  land \nacquisition and other involuntary resettlement impact will be avoided or minimized by exploring \nall viable alternative subproject designs; (ii) where such impact is unavoidable, time-bound RPs \nwill  be  prepared  and  APs  will  be  assisted  in  improving  or  at  least  regaining  their  standard  of \nliving  before  the  Program;  (iii)  APs  will  be  consulted  on  compensation,  will  be  informed  about \nresettlement plans and arrangements, and will participate in the planning and implementation of \nsubprojects; (iv) vulnerable groups will be provided special assistance;4 (v) APs including non-\ninformal  dwellers/squatters  and  encroachers)  will  be  paid \ntitled  persons \ncompensation/assistance  at  replacement  rates  for  the  assets  acquired  from  them;  (vi) \ncompensation and resettlement assistance will be provided before the contractor takes physical \nacquisition  of  the  land  and  before  the  start  of  construction;  (vii)  incomes  will  be  restored  and \nrehabilitated;  and  (viii) appropriate  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be  established.  The \nentitlement matrix for the Program, based on the above principles, is given in Table A10.1. \n\n(e.g., \n\n                                                 \n1   Particularly district headquarters and towns with significant tourism potential. \n2   The  assistance  will  be  based  on  the  state-level  framework  for  urban  reforms,  and  institutional  and  governance \nreforms recommended by the Government of India through the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \nand the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns. \n\n3   The sample subprojects are in Alwar, Jaisalmer, and Jhalawar. \n4   Including poor households, as well as households headed by women, the elderly, the disabled, and members of \nscheduled tribes, which are considered vulnerable on the basis of the indigenous peoples development framework \nagreed on by the state government and ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItem \nNo. \n1 \n\nType of \nLoss \n\nLoss of \nprivate land \n\nApplication \n\nAgricultural \nland, \nhomestead \nland, or vacant \nplot \n\nTable A10.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitled Persons \nLegal titleholders  \n\nCompensation Policy \n\u2022  Compensation at replacement value \n\n1a \n\nLoss of \nprivate land \n\nAgricultural \nland, \nhomestead \nland, or vacant \nplot \n\nTenants and \nleaseholders \n(whether having \nwritten tenancy or \nlease documents \nor not) \n\n1b \n\nLoss of \nprivate land \n\nAgricultural \nland \n\nSharecroppers \n\nor land-for-land option where \nfeasible.a \n\n\u2022  Fees, taxes, and other charges \nrelated to replacement land \n(applicable to the total of all parcels of \nreplacement land acquired, if these \nare noncontiguous because no \ncontiguous parcels are available). \n\u2022  Transitional allowanceb based on 3 \nmonths\u2019 minimum wage rates.  \n\n\u2022  Shifting assistancec for households. \n\u2022  Notice to harvest standing seasonal \ncrops.

The  consultants  will  include  SDSs \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s policy and procedures for the preparation of subproject RPs. The RPs  will \ncomply with national and state polices, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and other \nsocial  safeguard  guidelines,  and  the  RF.  The  RPs  for  sample  subprojects  will  be  used  as \nmodels  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  other  subproject  RPs.  The  approval  of \nsubproject  RPs  by  ADB  and  compensation  before  displacement  will  be  conditions  for  the  civil \nworks contract.  \n \n7. \nThe Executing Agency (EA) through the IPMU will ensure that the RF is closely followed \nwhen  an  RP  is  formulated  for  a  subproject.  The  EA  will  further  ensure  that  adequate \nresettlement budgets are delivered on time to IPMUs and IPIUs, and that NGOs are involved, \nfor the timely implementation of RPs. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Local  Self-Government  Department  (LSGD)  is  the  EA  responsible  for  overall \n8. \ntechnical  supervision  and  execution  of  all  subprojects  funded  under  the  Investment  Program. \nThe Implementing Agency (IA) is the project management unit for the ongoing Rajasthan Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  Project  (RUIDP),  which  will  be  expanded  into  the  IPMU,  to \ncoordinate the construction of subprojects and ensure consistency across the towns.6 The IPMU \nwill be assisted by: investment program management consultants (IPMCs), who will manage the \nInvestment  Program  and  ensure  the  technical  quality  of  the  design  and  construction;  and  by \ndesign  and  supervision  consultants  (DSCs),  who  will  design  the  infrastructure,  manage  the \ntendering of contracts, and supervise construction.  \n \n9. \nIPIUs will be established in fifteen zones across the state to manage the implementation \nof subprojects in their area.7 They will appoint construction contractors to build elements of the \n                                                 \n5  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience \u201cmajor impact\u201d\u2014defined as involving the physical \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\ndisplacement of APs from housing or the loss of 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n\n6  An interministerial empowered committee (EC) will provide LSGD with central policy guidance and coordination.

Internal \nmonitoring will be undertaken by the IPIU with assistance from the IPMU. Internal monitoring will \ninvolve: (i) administrative monitoring to ensure that implementation is on schedule and problems \nare dealt with on a timely basis; (ii) socioeconomic monitoring during and after any resettlement \nimpact,  using  baseline  information  established  through  the  socioeconomic  survey  of  APs \nundertaken during subproject preparation; and (iii) overall monitoring to assess AP status. Job \ncharts will be given to the SDS. The job charts will indicate the targets to be achieved during the \nmonth.  Monthly  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  IPMU,  showing  actual \nachievements  against  the  targets  fixed  in  the  respective  job  charts  and  the  reasons  for \nshortfalls,  if  any.  The  IPIU  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and  maintaining  AP  databases, \ndocumenting the results of the AP census, and verifying asset and socioeconomic survey data, \nwhich will be used as the baseline for assessing RP implementation impact. The EA will appoint \nan independent agency to undertake external monitoring to document: (i) restoration of income \nlevels;  (ii)  changes  and  shifts  in  occupation  pattern;  (iii)  changes  in  AP  type  of  housing; \n(iv) assessment of APs\u2019 access to amenities, such as water, electricity, and transportation; and \n(v)  performance  of  NGOs,  IPIU,  and  IPMU  in  resettlement  implementation.  The  independent \nagency will monitor subprojects twice a year and submit reports directly to the EA (IPMU). The \nEA in turn will submit all external monitoring reports to ADB for review.  \n \nG. \n \n14. \nDetailed budget estimates for involuntary resettlement will be prepared for each RP, by \nthe  IPMU.

The  Investment  Program  will  also \nprovide  policy  reforms  to  strengthen  urban  governance,  management,  and  support  for  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services.2  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  sample  subprojects3 \n(Supplementary Appendix J) and an overall summary IEE were prepared. The IEEs were based on \nfield  surveys,  secondary  information,  and  discussions  with  stakeholders.  Salient  points  from  the \nIEEs are summarized below. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe Investment Program is designed to maximize environmental and public health benefits. \nIEEs  conducted  for  the  Investment  Program  show  that  net  subproject  environmental  benefits  are \npositive  and  large  including:  increases  in  quantity  and  improvements  in  quality  of  drinking  water \nfrom  water  supply  subprojects;  better  public  health,  particularly  reduction  in  waterborne  diseases \nthrough  water  supply,  sewerage,  drainage,  solid  waste  management  investments;  improved \naesthetics  from  sewerage,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management  works;  reduced  flooding \nthrough drainage improvement; reduced exposure to suspended particulates and to noise pollution \nthrough  urban  transport  and  road  components;  and  social  benefits  from  slum  improvement  and \ncivic  infrastructure  outputs.  The  potential  negative  subproject  impact  during  construction  and \noperation  will  not  be  significant  because  larger  facilities  will  be  located  in  low-density  and \nnonsensitive areas, the works will be small in scale and the construction period short, and simple \ntechnologies  will  low  maintenance  requirements  will  be  preferred.  The  Investment  Program  does \nnot have any cumulative impact but is designed to support the state government in developing the \ncovered sectors. In the longer term (beyond the Investment Program period), sector-wide positive \nimpact is envisioned. \n \n3. \nEnvironmental subproject selection guidelines ensure that the Investment Program will not \nhave  any  significant  negative  environmental  impact  and  no  impact  on  environmentally  sensitive \nareas.  Subprojects  with  potentially  significant  and  permanent  impact  will  not  be  allowed.  The \npotential negative impact and mitigation measures are summarized in the table below. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe Local Self Government Department (LSGD) is the Executing Agency (EA) responsible \nfor  overall  technical  supervision  and  execution  of  all  subprojects  funded  under  the  Investment \nProgram, and it will carry out the mitigation measures assigned to it as part of its management of \nthe Investment Program. The Implementing Agency (IA) is the project management unit (PMU) of \nthe  ongoing  RUIDP,  which  will  be  expanded  into  the  investment  program  management  unit \n(IPMU),  to  coordinate  the  construction  of  subprojects  and  ensure  consistency  across  the  towns.4 \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n                                                 \n1  Particularly district headquarters and towns with significant tourism potential. \n2  The assistance will be based on the state-level framework for urban reforms, and institutional and governance reforms \nrecommended  by  the  Government  of  India  through  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  and  the \nUrban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns. \n\n3  The  sample  subprojects  are  in  urban  transport  and  roads  (Alwar),  sewerage  and  sanitation  (Alwar,  Jaisalmer),  solid \nwaste management (Alwar, Jaisalmer, Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan), water supply (Alwar, Jaisalmer, Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan), \nand urban drainage (Jaisalmer, Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan). \n\n4   An interministerial empowered committee (EC) will provide LSGD with central policy guidance and coordination. The \nEC  will  be  chaired  by  the  minister  of  urban  development  and  local  self  government,  and  its  members  will  include \nministers, directors, and representatives of other relevant government ministries and departments. \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe IPMU will be assisted by: investment program management consultants, who will manage the \nInvestment Program and assure technical quality of the design and construction; and design and \nsupervision  consultants  (DSCs),  who  will  design  the  infrastructure,  manage  the  tendering  of \ncontracts, and supervise construction.

Once  the  infrastructure  begins  to \noperate,  responsibility  will  be  transferred  to  the  appropriate  state  or  local  government  agency, \nwhich  will  be  given  training,  support,  and  financial  assistance  through  Rajasthan  Urban  Sector \nDevelopment  Investment  Program  where  necessary  to  enable  it  to  fulfill  its  responsibilities.  They \nwill  employ  local  operation  and  maintenance  contractors  to  maintain  and  repair  the  infrastructure \nas required. \n \n6. \nEnvironmental  issues  during  the  Investment  Program  period  will  be  coordinated  by  an \nenvironmental  specialist  within  the  IPMU,  who  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  comply  with \nenvironmental  safeguards.  An  environmental  monitoring  specialist  with  the  IPMC  team  will \nimplement  the  environmental  monitoring  plan  from  each  IEE.  The  implementation  will  involve \nobservations and surveys throughout construction to ensure that mitigation measures are provided \nand  the  environment  is  protected  as  intended.  Domestic  environmental  consultants  will  be \nappointed  to  assist  the  IPIUs  in  updating  the  IEEs  in  the  detailed  design  stage,  and  in  preparing \nIEEs  or  Environmental  Impact  Assessments  for  new  subprojects,  where  required  to  comply  with \nthe  policies  of  the  Government  of  India  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  IPMU  will \nalso  appoint  consultants  to  conduct  surveys  of  the  long-term  impact  of  the  infrastructure.  The \nsurveys will involve data collection in the construction period and during each of the first 5 years of \noperation of the schemes.6  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n5   City-level  committees  (CLCs)  have  been  set  up  to  monitor  project  implementation  in  each  town.  Chaired  by  the \ndistrict  collector,  each  committee  will  draw  its  members  from  the  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs),  state  government \nagencies, the IPIU, community based organizations, and nongovernment organizations. \n\n6  During implementation the contractor will submit to the IPIU monthly progress reports, which include a section on EMP \nimplementation.  The  IPIU  will  submit  reports  to  the  IPMU  for  review.  The  IPMU  will  review  the  progress  reports  to \nensure that the all mitigation measures are properly implemented. The IPMU will consolidate the monthly reports and \nsubmit quarterly reports to ADB for review. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n63\n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nThe  primary  stakeholders7  are:  residents,  shopkeepers,  and  businesspeople  who  live  and \n7. \nwork near the construction sites; custodians and users of socially and culturally important buildings \nin  these  areas;  state  and  local  authorities  responsible  for  the  conservation  of  historical  and \narchaeological  sites  and  artifacts;  state  and  local  tourism  authorities;  and  the  urban  local  bodies \n(ULBs).  The  secondary  stakeholders8  are:  LSGD,  other  relevant  government  institutions, \nnongovernment organization and community-based organizations working in affected communities, \nother  community  representatives  (prominent  citizens,  religious  leaders,  elders),  the  beneficiary \ncommunity in general, and ADB. \n \n8. \nStakeholders were involved in developing the IEEs through face-to-face discussions on-site \nand  public  meetings  in  three  towns.9  Views  expressed  were  incorporated  into  the  IEEs  and  the \nplanning and development of the Investment Program. All IEEs and other relevant documents will \nbe made available at public locations in the towns and will be disclosed to a wider audience via the \nADB  website.  The  consultation  process  will  be  continued  and  expanded  during  Investment \nProgram implementation, when LSGD will appoint a nationally recognized NGO to handle this key \nelement to ensure that stakeholders participate fully in subproject execution. \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n\nEnvironmental Selection Guidelines and Environmental Review Procedures \n\nE. \n \n9. \nThe IEEs show that the sample subprojects will result in large net environmental benefits, \nand  that  any  adverse  environmental  impact  will  be  largely  temporary  and  localized  and  can  be \naddressed  through  subproject  design  and  mitigation  measures.  No  further  assessment  of \nenvironmental impact is required for the sample subprojects.  \n \nF. \n \n10. \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  guidelines  and  requirements  of  the \nGovernment  of  India  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  environmental  subproject  selection \nthe \ncriteria  and  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nimplementation  of  future  subprojects  have  been  developed.

Avoid  involuntary  resettlement  by  prioritizing  rehabilitation  over  new  construction,  using  vacant \ngovernment  land  where  possible,  and  taking  all  possible  measures  in  design  and  selection  of  site  or \nalignment to avoid resettlement impact. \n\n3.  Ensure  consistency  of  designs  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  follow  the \n\nresettlement framework prepared for the project and agreed on by the state government and ADB. \n\n4.  Avoid environmentally sensitive locations, including sites with national or international designation (e.g., \n\n5. \n\nfor ecological/biological conservation, or of historical or cultural importance). \nIf work is proposed with the aim of improving the conservation or management of designated sites (e.g., \ndrainage), undertake this only: (i) after a comprehensive study and development of management plans \nand criteria; and (ii) with the direct involvement and approval of national and local bodies responsible for \nthe site. \n\n6.  When designing infrastructure that involves excavation in urban areas, consult the relevant authorities to \nascertain the location of any water pipelines containing asbestos concrete (AC) pipes, then design the \nlocations of new infrastructure to avoid excavating or disturbing any AC material. \n\n1.  Comply  with  all  requirements  of  relevant  national  law,  including  the  Water  (Prevention  and  Control  of \n\n2.  Use  water  sources  at  sustainable  levels  of  abstraction  only  (i.e.,  without  significantly  reducing  the \n\nquantity or quality of the source overall). \n\n3.  Avoid using water sources that may be polluted by upstream users. \n4.  Avoid water-use conflicts by not abstracting water that is used for other purposes (e.g., irrigation). \n5.  Locate  all  new  facilities  (WTPs,  tubewells,  etc.)  at  least  100  m  from  houses,  shops,  or  any  other \npremises used by people, thus establishing a buffer zone to reduce the effects of noise, dust, and the \nvisual appearance of the site. \n\n6.  Locate  WTPs  on  sites  where  there  is  no  risk  of  flooding  or  other  hazards  that  might  impair  the \n\nfunctioning of the plant or present a risk of damage to the plant or its environs. \n\n7.  Consult the relevant national or local archaeological agencies regarding the archaeological potential of \nproposed sites of WTPs, TWs, and primary mains, to ensure that these are located in areas where there \nis a low risk of chance finds. \n8.  Avoid using pipes made from AC. \n9.  Locate pipelines within the right-of-way (ROW) of other linear structures (roads, irrigation canals) as far \n\nas possible, to reduce the need to acquire new land. \n\n10. Ensure that pipeline routes do not require the acquisition of a significant proportion (more than 10%) of \n\n11.

Ensure  that  improvements  in  the  water  supply  system  are  combined  with  improvements  in  sewerage \n\nand drainage to deal with the increased discharge of domestic wastewater. \n\n1.  Comply with all requirements of relevant national laws, including the Water (Prevention and Control of \n\n2.  Locate sewage treatment plants (STPs) at least 500 m from any inhabited areas, in locations where no \nurban expansion is expected in the next 20 years, so that people are not affected by any odor or other \nnuisance from the plant (this requirement may be reviewed and modified depending on the technology \nadopted for the treatment of wastewater). \n\n3.  Locate  STPs  on  sites  where  there  is  a  suitable  means  of  disposal  for  the  treated  wastewater  effluent \n(e.g., into a natural watercourse or irrigation canal) or provide a means of disposal (e.g., new irrigation \ncanal) as part of the scheme. \n\n4.  Locate STPs on sites where there is no risk of flooding or other hazards that might impair the functioning \n\nof the plant and present a risk of damage to the plant or its environs. \n\n5.  Consult the relevant national or local archaeological agencies regarding the archaeological potential of \nproposed sites of STPs, pumping stations, and main sewers, to ensure that these are located in areas \nwhere there is a low risk of chance finds. \n\nWastewater \nManagement  \n\nPollution) Act, 1974. \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n6.  Ensure that sewage is treated at all times to national wastewater discharge standards, and confirm this \n\nthrough regular monitoring of effluent from the STP. \n\n7.  Ensure that no wastewater is discharged into a watercourse, where it could be a hazard to downstream \n\n8. \n\nusers (e.g., a waterway that is a source of water for domestic or municipal supply). \nInclude  measures  to  ensure  the  safe  disposal  of  sewage  sludge  without  causing  an  environmental \nhazard, and if possible to promote its safe and beneficial use as an agricultural fertilizer. \n\n9.  Locate  sewerage  pipelines  within  the  ROW  of  roads  wherever  feasible,  to  reduce  the  need  to  acquire \n\nnew land. \n\n10. Ensure that routes of sewage mains do not require the acquisition of a significant proportion (more than \n\n10%) of the total landholding of individual farmers. \n\n11. Ensure  that  communities  that  relinquish  land  needed  for  sewerage  mains  or  other  facilities  are \n\nconnected to the new sewerage system as part of the scheme. \n\n12. Avoid  locating  sewage  pumping  stations  and  wet  wells  within  200  m  of  any  inhabited  areas,  or  within \n500 m of sensitive sites such as hospitals, schools, and temples, to minimize the nuisance impact from \nodor, rodents, etc. \n\n1.  Comply  with  all  requirements  of  relevant  national  laws  including  the  Municipal  Solid  Wastes \n(Management and Handling) Rules, 2000; the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; the \nAir (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.   \n\n2.  Locate landfill sites at least 500 m (at least 1 km where possible) from any inhabited areas, in locations \nwhere no urban expansion is expected in the next 20 years, so that people are not affected by odor or \nother nuisance from the site. \n\n3.  Locate  landfills  on  sites  where  there  is  no  risk  of  flooding  or  other  hazards  that  might  impair  the \n\nfunctioning of the site and present a risk of damage to the site or its environs. \n\n4.  Locate landfill sites adjacent to STPs whenever possible so that leachate can be collected and treated. \n5.  Consult the relevant national or local archaeological agencies regarding the archaeological potential of \nproposed  landfill  sites,  to  ensure  that  these  are  located  in  areas  where  there  is  a  low  risk  of  chance \nfinds. \n\n6.  Provide  a  properly  engineered  and  managed  sanitary  landfill  site  that  is  sealed  to  prevent  leaching  of \ncontaminants into surface or groundwater. Refuse must be compacted and covered each day, and there \nmust be a separate concreted area for the safe disposal of hazardous waste. \n\n7.  Provide a composting facility for the beneficial use of biodegradable wastes such as vegetable peelings \n\n8. \n\nand agricultural waste. \nInclude a public education and information element to inform communities of their responsibility to place \ntheir waste at collection points, and to segregate waste that is suitable for recycling. \n\n1.  Continue the established practice of burying new main and secondary drains within existing roads as far \n\nas possible, to avoid the need to acquire new land. \n\n2.  Locate  new  tertiary  drains  within  the  ROW  at  the  side  of  roads  wherever  feasible,  again  to  avoid  the \n\nneed to acquire new land. \n\n1.  Develop road  improvement schemes (road  widening, bridge construction, etc.) only  where the need  is \n\nclearly demonstrated by appropriate traffic and hazard studies. \n\n2.  Prioritize the widening of existing roads over the construction of new roads, and widen roads within the \n\nexisting ROW to avoid the need to acquire new land. \n\n3.  Exclude  from  the  Investment  Program  road  construction  or  road  widening  projects  that  involve  land \nacquisition  or  resettlement,  except  as  otherwise  agreed  on  by  ADB  and  the  government  of  Rajasthan \nand  subject  to  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  the  related \nframeworks. \n\n4.  Provide  new  or  improved  drainage  to  remove  the  increased  runoff  caused  by  increasing  the  road \n\nsurface area. \n\n5.  Retain mature roadside trees, and if any trees have to be removed, plant two new trees for every one \n\n6. \n\nthat is lost. \nInclude tree planting alongside elevated bridges to provide a natural barrier to noise and visual impact, \nand include additional man-made barriers if necessary. \n\n7.  Consult the relevant national or local archaeological agencies regarding the archaeological potential of \nproposed sites of any new roads, bridges, or car parks, to ensure that these are located in areas where \nthere is a low risk of chance finds. \nEnsure that cultural heritage projects \n1.  are consistent with: (i) the heritage conservation and development plan of the Government of India; (ii) a \ncultural  heritage  management  framework  to  be  developed  for  the  project  and  agreed  on  by  the  state \ngovernment  and  ADB;  (iii)  a  site-specific  archaeological  and  historic  site  management  plan  to  be \ndeveloped  for  the  subproject  by  relevant  specialists  (archaeologists  and  conservation  architects)  in \n\nSolid Waste \nManagement \n\nUrban \nDrainage \n\nUrban \nTransport \nand Roads \n\nArt, Cultural \nHeritage, \nand Tourism \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n69\n\nconsultation with national and state government specialists, local and international NGOs and experts, \nand local communities. \n\n2.  prioritize  noninvasive  preservation  work  to  retard  deterioration,  stabilize  the  site,  and  maintain  current \n\nstates, over works involving restoration or reconstruction. \n3.  exclude adaptation (site modification for compatible use). \n4. \n\nfollow ADB\u2019s environmental assessment procedures, including classifying any subproject with significant \nimpact on cultural heritage sites as environment category A (could have significant negative impact).     \n\nEnsure that heritage and tourism subprojects \n1.  are proposed or requested by the relevant heritage and tourism authorities and identified as a priority in \n\nthe authorities\u2019 development plans. \n\n2.
