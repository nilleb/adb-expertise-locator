Of the \n$500  million  for  subprogram  1,  $200  million  will  be  from  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) resources.    \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Economic management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance, inclusive social \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability, financial and \neconomic governance, other vulnerable groups  \n \nCategory C. No adverse environmental impact was identified. \n\nto  8.5%  of  GDP \n\n \nPakistan\u2019s  economy  has  been  seriously  affected  by  the  skyrocketing \ninternational  prices  of  oil  and  food.  The  severity  of  the  exogenous \nshocks,  aggravated  by  the  uncertainties  surrounding  the  recent \npolitical  transition,  has  been  felt  on  several  fronts  over  the  last  fiscal \nyear (June 2007-July 2008): the year-on-year overall domestic inflation \nreaching  24%  from  7%;  deterioration  in  the  external  accounts  with \ncurrent  account  deficit  widening \nfrom  4.8%; \ndepreciation  of  the  Pakistani  rupee  (PRs)  by  22%;  foreign  exchange \nreserves declining by more than 40% to $6 billion (about 1.5 months of \nimports);  and  unprecedented  fuel,  food  and  electricity  subsidy  needs, \nwhich  rose  four-fold  to  PRs408  billion  ($6  billion)  from  their  original \nbudgeted level. Symptomatic of the declining investor confidence, the \nKarachi stock index dropped by more than 35% during April-July 2008, \nand the spreads on sovereign debt have surpassed 1,100 basis points \nat end-August 2008 from less than 200 basis points in early 2007. The \noutcome of all this has been a decline in real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth to 5.8% from 7% during the previous year.  \n \nThese challenges facing Pakistan have come despite steady real GDP \ngrowth of 7.3% on average per year during FY2004-FY2007. But they \nhave  also  come  in  the  context  of,  as  well  as  due  to,  persistent  fiscal, \ntrade and investment imbalances and lack of any significant structural \nchanges in the economy.  \n  \n\n \nBorrower \n \nProposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGovernment\u2019s Policy \nResponse and \nStrategy \n\nPakistan now needs to transform itself in three directions: \n \nFirst, it has to address the immediate distortions facing the economy, \nparticularly  in  the  agriculture  and  energy  sectors.  The  pricing  and \nprocurement system for wheat needs to be restructured, and subsidies \nbetter  targeted  to  benefit  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  Untargeted  wheat \nsubsidies  cost  the  Government  PRs40  billion  ($600  million)  in  fiscal \nyear (FY) 2008. In the electricity sector, Pakistan doest not yet have an \nautomatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism.  The  Government  needs  to \nreform the subsidy system in the sector, since it has not been able to \nsettle  the  payments  owed  to  distribution  companies,  which  has \nresulted  in  a  vicious  circular  debt  problem  and  debt  overhang.  This \nneeds  to  be  addressed  urgently  to  resolve  the  present  energy  crisis. \nElectricity  subsidies  are  estimated  to  have  cost  PRs133  billion  in \nFY2008  ($2  billion).  In  addition  to  these  subsidy  needs,  an  estimated \n$1.6 billion is required to partially protect the poor.   \n \nSecond,  Pakistan  needs  to  strengthen  financial  intermediation  to \nfacilitate structural transformation. At the macro level, the Government \nhas  relied  heavily  on  the  central  bank  for  its  fiscal  requirements,  a \npractice that needs to be reversed. In parallel, the legal and regulatory \nframework should be strengthened to manage risks more effectively in \nthe  financial  sector,  promote  consumer  confidence,  and  deepen \nfinancial intermediation.  \n \nThird, over the medium to long term, the production and trade structure \nof  the  economy  needs  to  be  transformed  so  Pakistan  can  compete \nmore  effectively  in  the  global  economy.  A  deeper  industrial  base  is \nvital,  along  with  a  more  productive  agricultural  sector,  greater  value \ncreation in the service sector, and far greater export sophistication. To \nachieve this, the Government has to (i) address short-term policy and \ninstitutional  distortions,  (ii) identify  industries  where  it  might  compete \non a global scale, and (iii) attract private sector investments. \n \nADB  has  worked \nthe  past  with  Pakistan  alongside  other \ndevelopment partners to support reforms and investments in all three \ndirections.  The  challenges  now  facing  the  country  are  diverse  and \nsignificant  that  immediate  assistance  is  needed  to  address  the  short \nterm  constraints  and  to  provide  safety  nets  for the  poor,  while  paving \nway for boosting Pakistan\u2019s competitiveness.  \n \nImmediate  priorities:  To  address \nthe  present  macroeconomic \nchallenges,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  four  point  stabilization \nplan, working in tandem with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). It has \nalso sought technical advice from development partners, including the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  in \ndeveloping the plan, which focuses on: (i) ensuring price stability and \neffective  demand  management  through  interest  rate  adjustments; \n(ii) pass-through of subsidies while protecting the poor from economic \nshocks;  (iii)  shoring  up  foreign  exchange  reserves;  and  (iv)  restoring \nfiscal discipline and reducing borrowing from SBP. \n\nin \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nMedium-term  agenda:  As  it  deals  with  the  short-term  challenges \nduring  the  current  fiscal  year  (by  June  2009),  the  Government  also \nplans to launch medium-term structural reforms in two key  directions. \nIncreasing  infrastructure  investments  in  power  and  transport  is  a  key \npart  of  its  strategy,  besides  adopting  measures  to  deepen  Pakistan\u2019s \nindustrial base and making its agriculture sector more productive. The \nGovernment plans to achieve this by rationalizing its own involvement \nin  key  economic  sectors,  and  by  attracting  greater  private  sector \nparticipation.  The  fiscal  space  generated  will  help  ensure  adequate \nsocial safety nets as well as adequate spending on health, education \nand other priorities. In parallel, Pakistan also has adopted a framework \nfor  a  medium-term  financial  sector  strategy  to  strengthen  financial \nintermediation and promote confidence. \n \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\n \nCoordination with \nDevelopment \nPartners \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  AETP  will  help  Pakistan  achieve  and  sustain  higher  economic \ngrowth  in  the  medium  term.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  AETP  is \nstructural  economic  transformation  through  (i) removal  of  short-term \ndistortions  in  the  agriculture  and  energy  sectors;  (ii)  strengthening  of \nfinancial intermediation; and (iii) development and implementation of a \nnational structural transformation strategy.  \n \nThe  AETP  will  help  Pakistan  address  the  challenges  posed  by  the \nongoing food and energy crisis in a systematic manner. Subprogram 1 \nis  also  one  of  ADB\u2019s  responses  to  the  food  crisis  in  the  region,  a \nresponse that was first announced by the President at the ADB Annual \nMeeting  in  May  2008  and  recently  set  forth  in  the  paper  ADB\u2019s \nResponse to the Food Crisis. \n \nADB has worked with other development partners on the short-term as \nwell  as  the  medium-term  issues.  On  macroeconomic  stabilization \nmeasures, ADB has relied on advice from the IMF and the World Bank \nand  exchanged  views  with  other  bilateral  partners.  Part  of  the  short \nand  medium-term  agenda,  as  it  relates  to  agriculture,  infrastructure \nand finance sector issues, is well grounded in ongoing investment and \npolicy support by ADB and other partners. Regular dialogue has taken \nplace,  including  in  finalizing  the  AETP  actions,  with  the  concerned \npartners.  The  structural  transformation  agenda  is  new  and  being \ndeveloped.  Several \ninvestment  climate  and \ncompetitiveness  reforms,  with  some  specializing  in  selected  sectors. \nOnce  the  principal  studies  under  the  AETP  are  completed  by  early \n2009,  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  all  stakeholders  in  helping  the \nGovernment chalk out the future reform directions. \n \nThe  AETP  will  be  structured  as  a  program  cluster  with  four  single-\ntranche subprograms to be implemented approximately between June \n2007 and July 2011, comprising \n  \n(i) \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\ninstitutions  support \n\nsubprogram 1 (covering reforms from June 2007 to September \n2008) - addressing the food and energy crisis, supporting short-\nterm  investment  climate  measures,  and  paving  the  way  for \nmedium-term structural transformation;  \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nThe proposed loans for subprogram 1 are as follows:  \n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsubprogram 2 (October 2008 to June 2009) - further reforms for \nstructural transformation;  \nsubprogram 3 (July 2009 to June 2010) - expanding reforms to \nenhance private sector participation in key sectors; and \nsubprogram  4  (July  2010  to  June  2011)  -  completion  of  the \ninitial phase of structural transformation.  \n\nterms  and  conditions  set \n\nA  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  the  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum;  and  such \nother \nloan \nagreement.  \nA  loan  of  $200  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  will  be  provided,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \na  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement. \n\nthe  draft \n\nforth \n\nin \n\n(ii) \n\n \nThe  subprogram  1  loans  totaling  $500  million  equivalent  will  be \navailable  following  satisfaction  of  subprogram  1  policy  actions  and \nafter loan effectiveness. \n \nTo  retain  the  reform  momentum  and  predictability  of  financing,  the \nGovernment  has  requested  that  subprogram  2  of  the  AETP  be \nprocessed  during  September  2008\u2013June  2009,  for  possible  approval \nbefore the end of June 2009 in the amount of $500 million. Subject to \nreform  progress  and  financing  requirements,  subprograms  3  and  4 \ncould  each  be  in  the  range  of  $400  million  to  $500  million,  with  the \nentire program cluster\u2019s aggregate amount in the range of $1.8 billion \nto  $2  billion.  The  scope  and  amounts  for  each  subprogram  will  be \nthe  respective \nthe  review  and  processing  of \nfinalized  during \nsubprograms. \n \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  generated  from \nthe  proceeds  of  the  OCR  loan  shall  be  used  first,  to  support  the \nadjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and  implemented  under \nsubprogram  1,  and  second, \nthe \nto \nGovernment\u2019s  general  development  purposes.  The  Government  shall \nensure that the local currency generated from the proceeds of the ADF \nloan  shall  be  used  to  support  the  poor  and  vulnerable  households \nunder the two targeted social safety net programs set forth in output 1 \nof subprogram 1. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the \nAETP. \n\nfinance  expenditures \n\nfor \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nfrom \n\nMOF  will  coordinate  with  the  concerned  ministries  on  the  AETP \ncontent, and will help ensure that the reform agenda stays on course. \nThe  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP)  will  handle  the  implementation  of \nactions  under  subprogram  1  and  future  subprograms  relating  to  the \nfinancial sector, in coordination with MOF. The Government will ensure \nthat other regulatory agencies or ministries are consulted as required. \nADB  will  closely  monitor  program  implementation  to  ensure  that \nenvisaged outputs and outcomes are achieved. \n \nLoan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \ncountries, other than the items specified in the negative list of ineligible \nitems and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and \nrelated  requirements  for  program  loans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed \nagainst \nthe  Government \nstipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of  Pakistan,  minus  its \nimports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is  equal  to  or \ngreater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a \nparticular  year.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe  AETP  will  not  only  help  stabilize  the  macroeconomic  situation  but \nalso benefit target groups affected by fuel and food inflation. It will help: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nimports  will  require  a  certificate \n\nMeet the large and immediate fiscal needs.  \nThe  Government  transition  from  the  current  system  of  inefficient \nand untargeted subsidies toward a targeted safety net program for \nthe poor. Beginning with about 2 million households immediately, \nand  expanding  to  cover  5  million  households  during  the  2008-\n2009  fiscal  year  if  the  safety  net  program  implementation  is \nsmooth,  the  AETP  could  potentially  target  up  to  9  million \nhouseholds. \nIt  will  raise  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  through  a \ndepositor protection scheme, and stronger financial intermediaries \nthat are better able to mobilize and allocate resources and risks. \nIt will open the way for structural transformation. \nIt  will  cut  transaction  costs  for  businesses  by  reducing  red  tape \nand improving the investment climate. \nOverall,  the  AETP  framework  will  enable  ADB  to  sustain  policy \ndialogue  on  structural  reform  in  sectors  where  ADB  has  been \nactively involved through past and current investments. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nWhile some of the risks of the AETP are political and outside its scope, its \ndesign will mitigate a range of others, including the following:  \n \n(i) \n\nInterest  group  resistance.  This  is  likely,  as  those  affected  by \nreforms in the short-term may resist. The Government is adopting \na  good  communication  strategy  to  articulate  the  long-term  and \ncountry stability interests that are behind the reforms. Further, the \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement  \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nprogram cluster nature of the AETP ensures prior actions by the \nGovernment before financing is provided.   \nWeak  capacity.  This  is  a  generic  concern,  which  is  elevated  in \ncase  of  complex  reforms.  Adequate  design  and  implementation \nsupport  is  being  mobilized  under  AETP  through  technical \nassistance.  The  agenda  under  the  AETP  is  also  largely  home-\ngrown. \nGlobal  food  and  fuel  crisis.  The  measures  under  AETP  are \npredicated on there being a global recovery. Although global price \ntrends  will  be  a  major  determinant,  AETP  measures  will \nrationalize  subsidies  and  target  them  better  to  cushion  Pakistan \nagainst some exogenous shocks. \nLack  of  policy  coordination.  The  AETP  will  demonstrate  the \nclear  benefits  of  product  diversification, \nindustrialization, \nprocessing  and  value  creation  and  will  therefore  help  build \nconsensus.  ADB\u2019s  current  analytical  and  design  work  on \ntransformation  is  supported  by  well-known  institutions,  which  will \nbring credibility to the reforms and help build momentum.  \n\n \nAt  the  same  time,  the  risks  associated  with  not  supporting  Pakistan\u2019s \nsafety net programs and the longer-term economic transformation agenda \nare also high. In the absence of timely reforms, the Government\u2019s budget \nwill  continually  be  burdened  by  costly  and  inefficient  subsidies,  leaving \nfewer  resources  for  development  financing.  The  financial  sector  will  be \nvulnerable  to  systemic  risks  and  investors  will  be  vulnerable  to  market \nfraud  and  misconduct.  Without  meaningful  structural  transformation, \ngrowth may once again be stalled and macroeconomic stability disrupted, \nbringing  the  country  back  to  the  previous  cyclical  pattern.  High  and \npersistent  macroeconomic  imbalances  will  constrain  investments  and \neconomic growth, and aggravate poverty. \n \nThe underlying assumptions for the AETP include   \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n \nAETP  embeds  a  TA  to  help  implement  the  AETP  and  to  design  the \nreform agenda for subprograms 2\u20134. It will also help monitor subprogram \n1  implementation  and  provide  the  Government  with  timely  policy  advice \nas  requested.  In  particular,  the  TA  will  support  implementation  of  a \nnational  structural  transformation  agenda,  and  advisory  work  on  the \nfinancial  sector.  It  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,040,000.  ADB  will  provide \n$800,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  and  the \nGovernment  will  contribute  $240,000  equivalent.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated from 3.1% during fiscal \nyear (FY) 2002 (July 2001-June 2002) to 9% in FY2005, before leveling off at 6.8% in FY2007. \nEconomic growth had just begun to be driven more by investment than by consumption.  \n \n3. \nCurrent  Challenges:  In  contrast  to  the  picture  over  the  last  few  years,  the \nmacroeconomic situation sharply deteriorated during FY2008 and July-August 2008, due largely \nto  exogenous  oil  and  food  price  shocks,  the  tumultuous  political  transition  and  security \nconcerns.  Aggravated  by  long-standing  structural  inefficiencies  in  the  agriculture,  industry  and \nenergy sectors, the economy slowed down to 5.8% in FY2008. Overall inflation went above 24% \nyear-on-year in July 2008, from just above 7% a year earlier. Fiscal and current account deficits \nshot up. The Pakistani rupee (PRs) depreciated by 22% since July 2007, with almost half of that \ndecline  taking  place  in  July-August  2008.  State  Bank  of  Pakistan\u2019s  (SBP)  gross  international \nreserves declined from $14.3 billion at the beginning of FY2008 to $8.6 billion at end-June 2008, \nand  further  to  $6  billion  or  1.5  months  of  imports.  The  political  events  and  economic \nuncertainties, compounded by the value erosion in international financial markets, led to a steep \ndecline in investor sentiments. The Karachi stock index, a top performer in the region, dropped \nby  more  than  35%  during  April-July  2008.  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s  downgraded  Pakistan\u2019s  debt \nrating  from  B+  to  B  in  May  2008  followed  by  Moody\u2019s.  In  parallel,  the  sovereign  spreads  on \nPakistani bonds rose from about 400 basis points in July 2007 to over 1,100 basis points at end-\nAugust 2008.  \n \nMacroeconomic  Imbalances:  Leading  to  the  adverse  outturns,  Pakistan  has  built  up \n4. \nsignificant macroeconomic imbalances, with a rise in fiscal and current account deficits, and an \nexpanding savings\u2013investment gap. The fiscal deficit rose to 7.4% of GDP in FY2008 from 4.3% \nin  FY2007,  due  to  lower  revenue  growth  and  rising  expenditures  brought  about  by \nunprecedented  food  and  fuel  price  hikes  and  by  the  concomitant  increase  in  subsidies.  The \ncurrent  account  deficit  in  FY2008  increased  to  8.4%  of  GDP  compared  with  4.8%  of  GDP  in \nFY2007,  due  to  worsening  conditions  in  all  three  accounts\u2014trade,  services,  and  income.  The \nimport  bill  increased  considerably  because  of  rising  international  commodity  prices  and \novershadowed  the  15.9%  increase  growth  in  exports  in  the  fiscal  year.  Textile  exports \n(accounting  for  almost  60%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  exports)  recorded  a  very  low  growth  of  3.8%  in \nFY2008.  Pakistan  also  faced  a  large  current  account  deficit  in  FY2007  that  was  financed  by \nlarge capital inflows. In FY2008, however, portfolio investment declined by 98.9% while foreign \ndirect  investment  growth  stagnated,  largely  as  a  result  of  political  events.  The  growth  in \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nremittances, while strong at 17.4% (reaching over $11 billion) has not been sufficient to offset \nthe decline in other components of the capital account. \n \n5. \nFiscal  Constraints:  In  the  short  term,  the  large  fiscal  imbalances  lie  at  the  heart  of \nPakistan\u2019s unstable macroeconomic situation. The current deficit level breaches the 4% ceiling \nmandated under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2005. The Government may have no option but \nto continue to run a revenue deficit, even if it is committed under that act to eliminate the deficit \nby  FY2008.  The  fiscal  situation,  if  not  addressed,  will  have  a  profound  and  costly  impact  on \noverall  macroeconomic  stability  and  growth  prospects.  There  are  four  key  facets.  First, \ncommodity  price  hikes  pushed  up  the  subsidies  for  oil,  electricity,  wheat,  and  fertilizer.  For \nFY2008, actual subsidies amounted to PRs407.5 billion ($6.0 billion), almost four times higher \nthan the original budgeted amount  of PRs114 billion ($1.7 billion). Second, interest payments, \nparticularly on domestic debt, has been growing and will almost double over FY2009\u2013FY2011 to \nPRs430  billion  ($6.3  billion)  over  the  level  in  FY2005  (PRs230 billion).  Third,  revenue  growth \nhas not accelerated. Pakistan\u2019s revenue to GDP ratio continues to be amongst the lowest in the \nregion,  at  around  10%  of  GDP.  Fourth,  development  expenditures,  which  more  than  doubled \nsince FY2003 to 5% of GDP in FY2007, need to be maintained at a fiscally sustainable level. \nElection-related promises pushed up budgeted spending to PRs520 billion in FY2008, although \nthe actual spending amounted only to PRs423 billion due to low absorptive capacity. In recent \nmonths, the new Government has allowed a steady (but insufficient) rise in domestic oil prices, \nadjusted  the  electricity  tariff,  cut  down  the  Public  Sector  Development  Program  (PSDP),  and \nfrozen  supplementary  grants  to  departments.  However,  these  measures  have  not  been \nsufficient  to  contain  the  situation,  and  the  fiscal  deficit  needs  to  be  financed.

Pakistan\u2019s poverty profile has \nseen  many  swings  over  the  last  2  decades.  Poverty  incidence  was  25.5%  in  the  early  1990s, \nbefore  rising  to  34.5%  in  FY2001,  and  declining  to  23.9%  in  FY2005  and  22.3%  in  FY2006, \naccording  to  government  estimates. 3  Other  studies  have  estimated  it  at  29.3%\u201336.4% \n(44 million\u201345  million  people).4 Meanwhile,  the  latest  Government  estimates  point  to  a  further \nreduction in the poverty rate to 22.3% in 2005/06. Household expenditure surveys indicate that \nthe share of food in total expenditures is inversely related to income levels, which means that a \nsharp rise in food price can have a devastating effect on the poor. Food expenditures make up \nan  average  of  about  60%  of  household  expenditures  of  the  poor  in  Pakistan.  Food  prices \nincreased by more than 20% in the first quarter of 2008, and by 32% year-on-year as of June \n2008.  ADB\u2019s  analysis5 shows  that  a  10%  increase  in  food  prices  could  drive  an  additional  7 \nmillion into poverty in Pakistan; a 20% increase, 14.7 million; and a 30% increase, 22 million.6 \nAfter food, the second major household expenditure is energy, the price of which increased by \nabout 30% in the first quarter of 2008. The rise in poverty incidence from such an increase in \nenergy prices is estimated to be much smaller at about 1.5 percentage points. ADB\u2019s analysis \nalso  shows  that,  if  every  poor  person  were  to  be  compensated  to  offset  the  loss  in  real \n                                                 \n3  Based on a Government-set threshold of 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day, which is the official poverty \n\nline. \n\n4  World  Bank.  2007.

A recent assessment shows that the application of the Government\u2019s monetized poverty line of PRs878.6 per \nperson results in a larger incidence ratio of 36.4%. Under this method, rural poverty incidence is 45.7% and urban \npoverty is 22.1%. Chaudhry, A.A., and T.T. Chaudhry. 2008. The Effects of Rising Food and Fuel Costs on Poverty \nin Pakistan.

Chaudhry (footnote 4). \n\n6  In terms of incidence, a 20% increase in food prices can take poverty incidence to as high as 37%\u201344%, or a full \n8 percentage points above the current estimated incidence levels. A 20% increase in food prices can increase rural \npoverty by as much as 8\u20139 percentage points and urban poverty by 5 percentage points.  \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nexpenditure caused by food and energy price increases, the Government may incur an annual \ncost of between PRs18.5 billion (0.3% of GDP) and PRs83 billion (1.3% of GDP).7 \n \nB. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Policy Response to the Challenges \n\nThe  Government  has  adopted  a  four  point  plan  to  deal  with  the  macroeconomic  and \n\n7. \nsocial impact of the exogenous shocks, as laid out in Box 1.  \n\nBox 1: Pakistan\u2019s Policy Response to the Current Macroeconomic Challenges \n\nThe Government of Pakistan and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have worked in tandem over the \nlast few months to adopt and implement a four-point plan focused on: \n\n(cid:57)  Dealing with inflation: SBP has raised its discount rate by 350 basis points over the last fiscal \nyear; cash reserve and statutory liquidity requirements were increased by 100 basis points in \nMay  2008.  Besides  strengthening  demand  management,  this  measure  will  also  bring \ncommercial  banks  into  the  Government  debt  market.  In  parallel,  the  Government  has  been \ncoordinating with provincial counterparts to reduce administrative barriers on mobility of goods. \n\n(cid:57)  Passing-through  the  subsidies,  while  protecting  the  poor  from  economic  shocks:  The \nGovernment has reiterated its commitment to achieving the 4.7% fiscal deficit target. Domestic \nfuel prices are being adjusted on a fortnightly basis, with domestic prices of gasoline and high \noctane  fuel  at  1.7  times  that  of  import  prices.  Subsidies  on  kerosene  and  light  diesel  oil  are \nbeing  brought  down.  The  Government  plans  to  increase  power  tariffs  by  62%  in  the  coming \nmonths,  with  the  first  increase  of  31%  to  be  made  effective  from  early  September  2008.  In \nparallel, the Government has allocated PRs41 billion ($600 million) in the budget for fiscal year \n2009 for social safety nets, which will provide support for up to 5 million households from the \nadverse economic shocks. The Government plans to expand the safety net cover over the next \nthree years. \n\n(cid:57)  Shoring  up  foreign  exchange  reserves:  The  Government  and SBP  have  taken  three  main \nsteps.  First,  they  are  negotiating  a  deferred  oil  payment  facility  with  friendly  oil  exporting \ncountries,  which  could  result  in  deferring  about  $5  billion  per  year.  Second,  an  aggressive \nprivatization  program  will  be  pursued.  Third,  they  have  imposed  a  range  of  administrative \nmeasures  to  conserve  foreign  exchange  have  been  introduced,  including  a  50%  limit  on \nadvance  payment  for  imports,  a  margin  requirement  of  35%  for  opening  letters  of  credit  for \nnon-essential imports, and a stipulation requiring prior SBP consent for outward remittances of \nmore than $50,000. \n\n(cid:57)  Restoring  fiscal  discipline  and  reducing  borrowing  from  SBP:  The  Government  aims  to \naddress  the  level  of  recurrent  and development spending.  It  has also set  a  target  of  keeping \nthe  net  borrowing  from  SBP  to  zero  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  Government  is  also  launching \nshort-term debt instruments to reduce the reliance on SBP borrowing. \n\n8. \nFederal Budget 2008/09: The federal budget for 2008/09 aims to reach the lower fiscal \ndeficit of 4.7% of GDP through fiscal consolidation involving rationalization of public expenditure \nand  achieving  strong  growth  in  revenues.  On  the  expenditure  side,  the  total  allocation  for \nsubsidies including those for power, oil, food, and fertilizer, at PRs295 billion is 28% less than \nthe actual subsidy level in FY2008. To curtail inefficient and untargeted recurrent spending, the \nGovernment  announced  in  the  budget  to  eliminate  oil  subsidies  by  December  2008  and  the \ndifferential power subsidy by the end of the fiscal year or earlier. In addition, a  freeze on non-\nsalary  spending  was  imposed  in  government  departments  to  curtail  current  expenditure.  \nHowever,  the  PSDP  for  2008/09  at  PRs550  billion  was  proposed  to  be  22%  higher  than  the \nrevised PSDP for 2007/08. But this too has been reportedly cut by more than PRs100 billion in \n\n                                                 \n7  Supplementary Appendix B contains an analysis of poverty in Pakistan. \n\n\fAugust 2008. On the revenue side, the tax revenue of PRs1.3 trillion for 2008/09 is 24% higher \nthan the actual tax receipts last year. Two major revenue mobilization measures included in the \nbudget  included  increasing  the  maximum  rate  of  import  duty  to  35%  and  sales  tax  increased \nfrom  15%  to  16%.  With  a  view  to  cut  down  imports  as  the  trade  and  current  account  deficits \ncontinued to climb and foreign exchange reserves precipitously fell in July and August 2008, the \nGovernment announced additional custom duties of 15 to 50% on the import of about 350 luxury \nitems and consumer goods. The steps announced by the Government in the budget to stabilize \nthe economy and reduce the fiscal and current account deficits have to be implemented in full to \nreinforce sustainable growth.  \n\n9. \nTo  protect  the  poor  from  the  impact  of  high  commodity  inflation  caused  by  soaring \ninternational  prices  and  reduction  in  subsidies,  the  Government  in  the  budget  also  instituted \nseveral relief measures. These included: raising minimum wages for unskilled workers; granting \n20 percent increase in the basic pay and pensions of all government employees; setting up of \nthe Benazir Income Support Program with initial allocations of PRs34 billion and cash grants of \nPRs1,000  to  identified  poorest  households;  establishing  a  national  employment  scheme  to \ncreate  self  employment  opportunities;  and  a  Peoples  Work  Program  to  create  employment \nopportunities and build small scale infrastructure with an allocation of PRs28.4 billion. \n \n10.  Medium-Term  Context.  Clearly,  the  present  challenges  facing  the  country  are  not  all \nshort-term.  The  lack  of  adequate  structural  reforms  is  among  the  primary  reasons  for  the \npersistent  and  frequent  episodes  of  fiscal  and  current  account  deficits,  in  turn  constraining \ninvestments  and  economic  growth,  and  aggravating  poverty.  The  current  challenges,  if  left \nunattended, will stall growth again and disrupt macroeconomic stability. Youth unemployment is \nalready over 10%. Job creation is vital, in an environment of political and security uncertainties. \nIn the longer run, Pakistan needs to widen and deepen the industrial and export base, increase \nproductivity,  and  expand  private  sector  involvement.  ADB\u2019s  latest  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram  Update  for  Pakistan  (2006\u20132008) 8 supports  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  on  higher \nsustained  growth.  The  proposed  AETP  will  help  initiate  the  structural  changes  needed  to \nachieve and sustain higher growth levels through a process of economic transformation. \n   \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nWhy Does Pakistan Need a Structural Transformation of its Economy? \n\n11. \nThe shares of key economic sectors in total output have been stagnant in Pakistan for \nmany  decades.  Agriculture  accounts  for  21%  of  GDP  now,  declining  from  26%  two  decades \nago. The share of industry declined in 1990s by two percentage points to 23.3% by the end of \nthe decade, before gradually increasing to 26% at present, while that of services has increased \nfrom  49%  in  1990  to  just  above  53%  now.  Figure  1  presents  the  changes  in  sectoral  shares \nsince 1990. More recently, overall real GDP growth slowed in FY2008 largely due to the poor \nperformance  of  agriculture  and  manufacturing.  Within  services,  trade,  transport  and  finance \nhave  registered  strong  growth.  Particularly,  extensive  structural  reforms  in  the  financial  sector \nsince the early 1990s have unleashed extraordinary growth. The share of the financial sector is \n6.5% at present. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update for Pakistan (2006\u20132008).

These  countries  changed  their  output \nand  employment  structures  dramatically,  transferred  resources  to  sectors  with  higher  value-\nadded  and  diversified  production.  Firms  within  these  countries  have  learned  to  produce  and \nexport  a  more  sophisticated  and  technologically  advanced  range  of  products,  and  their  labor \nproductivity  has  increased  significantly.  Pakistan  needs  a  structural  transformation  of  its \neconomy,  as  described  in  Appendix  3.  It  needs  to  grow  more  quickly  and  to  sustain  higher \ngrowth, to provide more jobs, and to increase the welfare of its growing population. It needs to \nspecialize in niche areas, and not to be trapped in areas where it no longer has a comparative \nadvantage. \n \n13. \nNeed  to  Sustain  Growth.  Pakistan registered an average annual growth rate of 5.5% \nduring 1960\u20132007. However, because of its relatively high population growth, between the mid-\n1980s and the early 2000s the per capita growth rate declined markedly (Figure 1 in Appendix \n3).  Since  2001,  however,  this  trend  has  reversed  and  policy  makers  hope  to  maintain  this \nperformance in the medium term. \n \n14. \nNeed to Deepen the Industrial Base. To achieve sustained growth, Pakistan needs to \ndeepen  its  industrial  base,  as  well  as  to  improve  its  performance  in  agriculture  and  services. \nWhile  the  share  of  the  manufacturing  sector  in  total  output  is  not  low  (nearly  20%),  it  has \nremained stagnant since the 1970s (Figure 3 in Appendix 3). The share of manufacturing value-\nadded  accounted  for  by  high-technology  products  is  low  and  has  remained  so  during  the  last \n\n                                                 \n9  Private investment increased to 16.2% of GDP in FY2007 from 15.4%, in FY2005 supported by improving business \nconfidence  and  an  increase  in  public  investment.  Private  savings  increased  between  FY2005  and  FY2007  but, \ngiven continued strong consumption, this was not enough to finance the expanded private investment. This pushed \nthe private savings\u2013investment gap to 3.4% of GDP in FY2007 from 2.9% in FY2006. \n\n\f40 years.  Pakistan\u2019s  exports  per  capita  are  low  (Figure  5  in  Appendix  3),  and  it  continues  to \ncompete with exports from even poorer countries (e.g., rice, cotton yarn, undergarments, cotton \nbed  linen,  and  other  woven  fabrics).  Labor  productivity  has  increased  very  slowly  since  the \n1970s with an annual growth rate of only 2.6%. Unless the production and trade structure of the \neconomy is transformed to enable it to compete effectively in global markets, Pakistan's 6%\u20137% \nreal GDP growth per annum is unsustainable.  \n \n15. \nIn  summary,  Pakistan  needs  (i)  a  deeper  industrial  base,  (ii) a  more  productive  and \nefficient agricultural sector, (iii) greater value creation in the service sector, and (iv) far greater \nexport  sophistication.  To  achieve  this,  Pakistan  needs  to  address  the  current  structural \ndistortions,  among  others,  in  energy  and  agriculture  sectors  immediately,  develop  a  stronger \nfinancial sector, and identify niche areas and sectors where the country can compete effectively \nand accelerate value creation. \n \nB. \n\nIssues, Growth and Reform Challenges, and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nImmediate Distortions in Key Sectors that Perpetuate Macroeconomic \nImbalances, Slow Growth and Impede Structural Transformation  \n\n \n16. \nUntargeted  Subsidies.  As  a  result  of  long-standing  sector  inefficiencies  and  the \nchallenges  described  below,  Pakistan  now  has  huge  subsidy  needs  to  cover  increases  in  the \nprice of oil, power, wheat, and fertilizer. The unprecedented increase in the price of oil resulted \nin  a  subsidy  of  PRs175  billion\u2014far  above  the  PRs15  billion  provided  for  in  the  budget.  The \npower subsidy arising from the tariff differential and other elements rose to PRs133.3 billion\u2014\nagainst  the  PRs72  billion  subsidy  in  the  budget.  The  subsidy  on  imported  wheat  and  wheat \nsupplied at concessional rates through the Utility Stores Corporation was in the range of PRs40 \nbillion\u2014no provision had been made for this in the budget. The fertilizer subsidy was PRs29.5 \nbillion\u2014against the budgeted amount of PRs13.5 billion. Figure 2 shows the major components \nof subsidies for FY2008 which amounted to PRs407.5 billion in total,  almost  four  times  higher \nthan the budgeted amount of PRs114 billion.  \n \n\nFigure 2: Budgeted vs. Actual Subsidies for 2007/08 \n(PRs Billion)\n\n175.0\n\n133.3\n\n72.5\n\n15.0\n\n13.5\n\n40.0\n\n29.5\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nBudgeted Subsidies\n\nActual Subsidies\n\nOil\n\nPower\n\nFertilizer\n\nWheat\n\nSources:  Government of Pakistan, Finance Division 2007.

The National Social Protection Strategy, which aims to bring social \nsafety nets to 6.1 million households in 2012 was approved in 2007.10 Before this, there was no \noverarching social protection strategy in Pakistan and a lack of direction and poor coordination \non  the  part  of  individual  agencies  and  programs.  Pakistan  has  set  up  a  range  of  schemes  to \nhelp  the  poor,  with  many  based  on  targeting  (Appendix  4).  Income  support  is  offered  through \ntwo cash transfer programs, Zakat and Bait-ul-Mal. However, the existing schemes suffer from \nfour key problems: weak design (including poor eligibility criteria), poor implementation, risk of \nelite  capture,  and  insufficient  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Further,  the  significant  needs  and \nchallenges facing Pakistan require a robust safety net scheme that is based on strong data and \ncriteria. The Government is working to improve targeting, delivery mechanisms, and monitoring \nthrough  a  number  of  initiatives.  Beneficiary  databases  are  being  cleaned  up  and  a \ncomprehensive computerized management information system based on computerized national \nidentity  cards  is  being  created.  Developing,  piloting,  and  expanding  proxy  means-tested \ntargeting  mechanisms  in  combination  with  community  validation  is  expected  to  enhance  the \ntransparency  and  credibility  of  the  system.  Fiduciary  risks  are  being  minimized  through \nimproved financial management and the introduction of consolidated accounts at the field level \nto ensure effective reconciliation.    \n \nDistortions in the Agriculture Sector.11 One of the most pressing concerns facing the \n18. \nGovernment  in  the  short  term  is  the  adverse  impact  on  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  of  the \ncontinued  rise  in  food  prices,  especially  wheat,  the  main  food  staple.  While  Pakistan  has \ngenerally  been  self-sufficient  in  wheat,  the  Government  puts  a  high  priority  on  ensuring  food \nsecurity  and  on  guaranteeing  adequate  and  affordable  wheat  and  wheat  product.12 To  attain \nfood security, the Government has adopted a dual price policy that protects the interests of the \nwheat farmers on one hand, and the wheat product consumers on the other. It assures wheat \nproducers of a support price13 that covers their costs of production. It also provides consumers, \nmost  of  whom  live  in  the  cities,  with  affordable  prices  by  enabling  flour  mills  access  to \nsubsidized wheat and assured quota allocations.14 The Government also helps to stabilize the \nprice of wheat and wheat products by maintaining a fair market share of total wheat production, \nwhich  averaged  27%  for  2000\u20132007,15 for  strategic  reserves  (for  emergency  purposes  and  to \nmeet the wheat requirements of the poor and vulnerable) and operational reserves (to stabilize \nthe  price  of  wheat  and  wheat  products).  This  market  share  is  maintained  through  domestic \n                                                 \n10 Government of Pakistan. 2007. National Social Protection Strategy. Islamabad. \n11 Appendix 5 outlines the key production, pricing, procurement and distribution issues related to wheat in Pakistan. \n12 Wheat products, particularly wheat flour (atta) and bread (roti), are a major part of the diet, providing about 60% of \nprotein and carbohydrate requirements. Households spend a substantial portion of their incomes on food. Wheat \nproducts  represent  15.9%  of  household  expenditure.  Wheat  is  Pakistan\u2019s  largest  food  grain  crop,  with  80%  of \nfarmers  cultivating  wheat  and  about  40%  of  cultivable  area  being  devoted  to  wheat  production.  Wheat  provided \n38% of total crop value added in FY2007. \n\n13 The  guaranteed  minimum  price  or  the  support  price  accorded  to  wheat  farmers  by  Government  is  the  estimated \nprice  of  wheat  that  would  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  costs  of  production.  The  support  price  is  announced  by  the \nGovernment in September or October, the starting time for wheat sowing. The support price is fixed and effective \nfor  the  whole  country  during  the  wheat  cultivation  period.  The  provincial  food  departments  and  directorates  buy \nwheat  from  farmers  at  designated  procurement  centers,  especially  in  harvest  season  months  when  the  wheat \nmarket price decreases to the support price. The provincial government stabilizes the price of wheat by releasing \nthis wheat during lean season months. \n\n14 The subsidized wheat price for flour mills is called the issue price. In theory, it is equivalent to the support price for \nfarmers plus the incidental costs of transporting and storing the wheat. In fact, the issue price is on average about \n10%  lower  than  the  actual  price.  This  is  equivalent  to  a  subsidy  from  the  provincial  governments  which  absorb \nmost of the incidental costs and part of the support price.   \n\n15 The  provincial  government  stabilizes  the  price  of  wheat  by  releasing  the  procured  wheat  especially  during  lean \nseason months. Provincial food departments and directorates procure a certain volume every year to enable them \nto  stabilize  prices.  The  publicly  announced  procurement  quota  was  4  million\u20135  million  tons;  actual  procurement \naveraged 3.5 million tons. \n\n\fprocurement,  imports  if  there  is  a  foreseen  shortfall  in  production,  and  exports  if  there  is  a \nsurplus.     \n \n19. \nTo support the regulated prices and procurement activities at farms and flour mills, the \nGovernment  administers  the  trading  and  marketing  of  wheat  reserves  as  well  as  imports  and \nexports  through  its  Pakistan  Agricultural  Storage  and  Supplies  Corporation  (PASSCO),  the \nTrading  Corporation  of  Pakistan,  and  the  provincial  food  departments  and  directorates.  These \nregulatory measures are supported by state-owned storage facilities, procurement centers, and \nutility retail stores, as well as by easy access to credit from the SBP and commercial banks. The \nGovernment subsidy for wheat price stabilization purposes at the federal and provincial levels is \nsubstantial. The wheat subsidy on imported wheat products and those supplied at concessional \nrates  through  the  Utility  Stores  Corporation  was  in  the  range  of  PRs40  billion  (2.6%  of  the \nbudget) for FY2008, although no provision had been made for this in the budget.  \n \nUnder  the  ADB-funded  Agriculture  Sector  Program  Loan  Phase  II 16  (ASPL  II),  the \n20. \nGovernment  agreed  to  remove  the  pervasive  public  sector  interventions  in  the  wheat  market, \nwhich created disincentives for wheat producers, millers, and traders to develop an integrated \nfood  industry.  Initiatives  included  the  removal  of  market  restrictions  in  trade,  elimination  of \nconsumer  subsidies  and  producer  support  subsidies,  the  divestiture  and  restructuring  of \nPASSCO  and  provincial  food  departments,  the  closure  of  food  directorates,  and  streamlined \nwheat reserve management. Because of the politically sensitive nature of the wheat policy and \nthe volatile sociopolitical situation in the first half of the current decade, a phased market-based \nwheat policy that would lay the groundwork for a market-oriented wheat industry was deemed \nthe most politically feasible approach. At the end of ASPL II in mid-2007, the government had \nreduced the gap between the support and issue prices and international prices, completed the \nrestructuring  plans  for  PASSCO  and  food  departments  and  directorates,  enabled  freer \nmovement  of  wheat  domestically  and  internationally,  and  drawn  a  distinction  between \noperational and strategic reserves.  \n \n21. \nThe  second  half  of  2007  was  a  litmus  test  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nsustaining  the  phased  market  reforms  in  wheat.  Because  of  the  profit  incentives  that  can  be \ngained from the higher market prices for wheat and wheat products, the Government, despite its \nefforts  to  defend  the  public-determined  prices  of  wheat  and  wheat  products  and  its  use  of \ncoercion to restrict trade and achieve its procurement targets, was powerless to stop prices from \nincreasing.  Consequently,  the  poor  and  vulnerable  bore  the  brunt  of  high  prices  and \ninaccessible  food  as  the  Government\u2019s  food  security  strategy  did  not  put  in  place  an  effective \ntargeted  safety  net  measure.    There  are  renewed  interests  in  Government,  civil  society  and \nsome  parts  of  the  private  sector  in  reverting  to  a  greater  public  role  in  the  wheat  sector  to \nensure food security. It is essential that the investments in phased market reforms under ASPL \nII be ensured by accelerating the implementation of reform measures. Key policy measures that \nneed to be brought to their logical conclusion include (i) the elimination of the consumer subsidy \nfor wheat by moving to a market-based sale price, (ii) the elimination of the producer subsidy by \nmoving from a support price to a market-based price for the procurement of wheat, (iii) efficient \nreserve  management  based  on  strategic  reserves,  (iv) an  end  to  restrictions  on  domestic  and \ninternational wheat trade, and (v) streamlining the roles of PASSCO and food departments and \ndirectorates  in  strategic  reserve  management.  These  need  to  be  complemented  by  policies  to \nprovide targeted safety net measures for the poor and vulnerable groups and the promotion of \nnew financial instruments and institutional arrangements to integrate farms with consumers. \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \n\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agriculture Sector Program II. Manila. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn  the  medium  term,  the  lynchpin  of  sustainable  food  security  is  high  economic  growth \n22. \nbased on economic activities that create jobs in agro-industries with high value-added and in the \nmanufacturing  and  service  sectors.  Assured  and  rising  incomes  would  be  a  more  sustainable \nway for the poor to cope with food price spikes and to move out of poverty permanently. This \nwould  form  the  foundation  for  transforming  subsistence  agriculture  into  commercial  and  pro-\npoor  agriculture,  which  would  in  turn  finance  the  development  of  value-adding  manufacturing \nand service sectors.  \n  \nChallenges in the Energy Sector. Pakistan\u2019s energy sector is in deficit, both in energy \n23. \nand in financial terms. Although the country's energy resources are diverse (comprising power, \noil, gas, coal, nuclear and renewable energy), energy insecurity and a power crisis persist. The \nsector  remains  institutionally  fragmented  and  there  is  a  lack  of  integrated  energy  planning  to \naddress the country\u2019s short, medium- and long-term energy needs. There is insufficient power \ngeneration  to  meet  rising  demands  and  the  demand\u2013supply  imbalance  reached  5000  MW  in \nJune 2008.17 Critical investments in the generation and distribution systems have not kept pace \nwith economic growth so available electricity is not effectively dispersed to end consumers. The \ntransmission system is no longer a bottleneck, but the system margins and expansion program \nneed to be effectively implemented to prevent network instability and constraints. The global oil \nprice hike and general fiscal shortcomings have created a circular debt18 problem in the energy \nsector,  stopping  power  generation  companies  from  reaching  optimal  production  levels. \nPakistan\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  will  be  seriously  affected  if  these  twin  deficits  are  not \naddressed urgently.19  \n \n24. \nPakistan does not have an automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism. Regulatory \ntariffs have not kept up with the rising cost of operating, maintaining, and expanding the system, \nparticularly  in  an  environment  of  rising  fuel  costs  given  Pakistan\u2019s  large  thermal  generation \ncapacity which runs mainly on fuel oil. There continues to be a discrepancy between the tariff \ndetermined  by  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  and  the  tariff  notified  by  the \nGovernment.  Because  of  fiscal  constraints,  the  Government  has  not  been  able  to  disburse \ntimely  power  subsidies  (which  cover  the  difference  between  the  National  Electric  Power \nRegulatory  Authority\u2019s  determined  tariff  and  the  tariff  notified  by  the  Government),  thereby \ndepleting  the  sector  of  liquidity  and  cash  flow.  As  a  result,  power  distribution  companies \n(DISCOs) have not paid off their liabilities fully for their electricity purchases, causing a working \ncapital shortfall for the power generation companies. As a result, they cannot pay their oil and \ngas suppliers for fuel purchases. This spill-over has severely affected the entire energy supply \nchain and the inter-corporate circular debt is estimated to be close to PRs60 billion, causing an \nacute liquidity crisis and a deterioration of fuel stock levels at all links in the value chain. \n \n25. \nA power tariff freeze from 2003 to 2007 in the wake of rising fuel prices and late payment \nof subsidies by the Government meant that by the end of FY2007 the DISCOs owed the Central \nPower Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited \n(NTDC) almost PRs220 billion. It is estimated that the debt had reached about PRs240 billion by \n30 June 2008, in accordance with the Annual Financial Statements of the DISCOs and NTDC. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Pakistan faces a current demand of about 15,140 MW (peak-hour demand). This will rise to about 28,000 MW by \n\n2015, 41,000 MW by 2020, and 60,500 MW by 2025 and a huge 84,800 MW by 2030. \n\n18 Circular  debt  is  accumulated  debt  among  a  series  of  entities  from,  for  example,  the  customer  through  the  power \ndistribution  company  all  the  way  to  the  fuel  supplier  of  the  power  generation  station.  The  root  cause  has  been \nnonpayment by the Government and its entities. \n\n19 Appendix 6 presents the key energy sector issues facing Pakistan. \n\n\fSince  1992,  Pakistan  has  been  contemplating  a  restructuring  of  the  power  sector.  The \n26. \nobjectives of these reforms are yet to be fully achieved: (i) private investment has been attracted \ninto the generation subsector, particularly in the mid-1990s, but it has declined in recent years \n(Karachi Electric Supply Company Limited\u2019s privatization has not yielded expected technical and \nfinancial efficiency results and the ex-Water and Power Development Authority DISCOs are yet \nto be privatized), (ii) the quality of service to the end user has been compromised significantly \nby power shortages (leading to riots during peak demand summer months) and by overloading \nof the transmission and distribution networks, and (iii) instead of being a net contributor to the \nnational treasury, the power sector has become a fiscal burden to the tune of $2 billion a year. \nThe  successful  implementation  of  reforms  will  be  even  more  important  as  the  Government \nseeks  to  attract  large  private  sector  participation  in  developing  and  funding  the  current  and \nfuture power generation and system requirements. The reform agenda clearly has some way to \ngo.  The  immediate  needs  include  corporate  autonomy  and  sector  governance,  electricity \ntrading, and financial management.  \n \n27. \nThe fiscal imbalances afflicting the power sector need to be addressed immediately and \ncomprehensively. It is essential to determine the actual amount of the debt, to isolate it, and to \ndevelop  a  realistic  debt  restructuring  plan  that  is  acceptable  to  all  stakeholders.  It is  expected \nthat  any  debt  restructuring  plan  would  need  to  span  several  years.  In  parallel,  the  DISCOs \nshould be allowed to charge cost recovery rates and the generation companies must have real \nand timely cost adjustments for their tariffs. The capacity and distribution bottlenecks need to be \naggressively tackled. The Government is keen to address the short-term generation crisis, and \nto ensure sufficient funding for NTDC and the DISCOs so they can improve their transmission \nand distribution systems. Strategic decisions for long-term hydroelectricity generation have to be \ntaken today. \n \n\n2. \n\nLimited Financial Intermediation \n\n \nProgress.  Structural  transformation  is  dependent  upon  an  effective  and  efficient \n28. \nfinancial sector. The Government is committed to reforming this sector to enable it to become \nmore  competitive  and  a  more  inclusive  part  of  the  Pakistan  economy.  Recent  bold  reforms  to \ndevelop the banking sector have resulted in substantial deregulation, the transformation of the \nbanking sector from a predominantly state-owned system into a healthier market-based system \nprimarily  owned  by  the  private  sector,  and  the  emergence  of  SBP  as  a  more  responsive  and \nindependent regulator. Locally incorporated private banks now control 74% of banking assets, \nas compared with 4% in 1992. Total banking assets (less funds held in SBP) represent 56.1% of \nGDP, as compared with 66.8% in India, for example. \n \n29.  Challenges to Prudential Regulation. In line with emerging best international practices, \nSBP  continues  to  review  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  banking  sector  to  ensure \nthat  it  enables  growth  and  increases  the  depth  of  this  sector  without  compromising  stability. \nWhile  SBP  continues  to  systematically  update  its  prudential  regulations,  it  faces  ongoing  and \nemerging challenges, many of which arise from implementation of the Second Basel Accord on \ncapital adequacy (Basel II). Many banks need to improve their risk management.  \n \n30. \nFinancial  Sector  Consolidation.  The  emergence  of  financial  conglomerates  has \nbecome a feature of the financial sector in Pakistan and globally. A major features of banking \nsector reform in Pakistan has been the consolidation of the banking sector in order to establish \nfewer  but  stronger  banks.  There  have  been  22  bank  mergers  and  7  bank  acquisitions  since \n2000, most of which have involved mergers between commercial and investment banks. Groups \nof  affiliated  financial  sector  entities  that  include  a  bank  (hereinafter  \u201cfinancial  conglomerates\u201d) \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nare  becoming  the  norm,  as  banks  broaden  their  product  offerings  and  seek  cross-selling \nopportunities. In addition to interests in investment banks, a number of banks also own shares \nin insurance companies and have interests in asset management companies and mutual funds. \nSome banks own shares in local banks and microfinance banks, and many may be involved in \nother  nonbank  financial  activities  such  as  leasing,  advisory,  and  brokerage  services, \nmodaraba20 management, and foreign exchange. \n \n31.  While  the  emergence  of  financial  conglomerates  is  commercially  attractive,  it  raises  a \nrange of issues for the regulation of the financial sector. The main risks introduced by financial \nconglomerates relate to conflicts of interest and potential contagion. Risks have become more \ndifficult  to  monitor  because  financial  conglomerates  operate  across  several  segments  of  the \nfinancial system. In the absence of proper consolidated supervision, a financial conglomerate or \nany  of  its  subsidiaries or  affiliates may  become  vulnerable  to  double  counting  of  capital,  large \nintra- and extra-group exposures, contagion problems among entities within the conglomerate, \nand  conflicts  of  interest  between  business  units  within  the  conglomerate.  There  is  also  a  risk \nthat  losses  from  banks  will  be  transferred  to  less  regulated  and  supervised  nonbank  financial \nsector  affiliates  to  avoid  scrutiny.    Financial  sector  supervisors  need  to  improve  their \nunderstanding of the businesses of financial conglomerates as well as the means of accessing \ninformation and taking regulatory actions. \n \nRegulatory  Fragmentation  and  Arbitrage.  Pakistan\u2019s  existing  regulatory  architecture \n32. \nhas  an  awkward  separation  of  powers  between  SBP  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission  of  Pakistan  (SECP).  SBP  supervises  and  regulates  banks,  development  finance \ninstitutions, microfinance banks, and exchange companies, whereas SECP regulates nonbank \nfinance companies (NBFCs).21   \n \n33. \nUnder  the  Banking  Companies  Ordinance,  1962,  banks  are  deposit-taking  institutions \nthat can perform all the functions performed by NBFCs, including investment banking, leasing, \nhousing  finance,  and  asset  management.  Banks  can  also  perform  NBFC  functions  by \nestablishing separate subsidiaries, which would, however, be regulated by the SECP.  \n \n34. \nDue to the nascent state of the local capital market, a number of NBFCs are engaged in \ndeposit-taking,  which  is  traditionally  regulated  by  banking  regulators  to  address  prudential  risk \nconcerns.  For  example,  while  investment  banks  traditionally  perform  corporate  advisory \nservices  such  underwriting  and  other  capital-market-related  activities,  they  have  gradually \nventured into deposit-taking and lending. They mobilize short-term funds from the general public \nand  extend  working  capital  and  overdraft  facilities  to  businesses.  Since  they  are  specifically \nprohibited  from  undertaking  commercial  banking  business,  they  get  around  this  restriction  by \nissuing withdrawal slips that work like checkbooks. A recent scandal involving one of the largest \ninvestment banks led the SECP to issue a directive to this bank to cease taking deposits\u2014the \ninvestment bank was unable to meet its obligations to depositors and institutional lenders. The \ndeteriorating  profitability  of  other  investment  banks  has  led  them  to  merge  into  more  solvent \ncommercial banks. \n \nNBFCs  were  previously  supervised  by  SBP.  However,  because  all  NBFCs  were \n35. \nincorporated  as  companies  under  the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984,  only  the  SECP  had  the \n                                                 \n20 Modaraba  is  a  contract  in  which  one  party  provides  capital  to  another  party  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  on  a \nbusiness  with  the  stipulation  that  the  profit  will  be  shared  by  the  participating  parties  in  the  clearly  specified  and \ndefined proportions agreed upon beforehand. Any loss incurred is to be borne exclusively by the capital owner. \n21 NBFCs  include  investment  finance  services  (investment  banking),  leasing,  housing  finance,  venture  capital \n\ninvestment, discounting services, and investment advisory and asset management services. \n\n\fpower  to  take  action  against  them.  Thus,  when  off-site  surveillance  and  on-site  inspection  of \nNBFCs  by  SBP  highlighted  irregularities,  SBP  had  to  ask  SECP  to  take  action  against  them \nunder  the  Companies  Ordinance.  In  December  2002,  regulatory  supervision  of  NBFCs  was \ntransferred from SBP to SECP through an amendment to the Companies Ordinance. At the time \nof the transfer, existing and largely single-product NBFCs serving specific market niches were \nallowed to offer a range of financial products. However, there was limited consolidation of NBFC \nactivities, while banks began to make rapid inroads into this area. As a result, the market share \nof investment banks, leasing companies, and housing finance companies declined considerably. \nAt the time of their transfer from SBP to SECP there were 16 investment banks, compared with \n8  at  present,  which  hold  less  than  1%  of  total  financial  sector  assets.  In  addition,  in  a  recent \ncase where an investment bank was found to have engaged in serious malpractice and fraud, \nthere  was  public  confusion  about  SBP\u2019s  oversight  role  since  investment  banks  use  the  word \n\u201cbank\u201d in their name. This confusion has threatened the reputation of the banking industry and \nof SBP as its regulator. \n \n36. \nPreventing  Money  Laundering.  Safeguarding  the  financial  sector  from  being  used  to \nlaunder  the  proceeds  of  criminal  activities  is  a  key  priority  for  the  Government. 22 It  aims  to \ndevelop and implement legal and institutional measures that will meet international standards to \ncombat  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  notably  the  Financial  Action  Task \nForce  on  Money  Laundering\u2019s  (FATF)  recommendations  on  anti-money  laundering  and \ncombating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT),  usually  described  as  the  FATF  40+9 \nRecommendations.23 \n \n37. \nTo this end, Pakistan has embarked on a range of efforts, including becoming a member \nof  the  Asia/Pacific  Group  on  Money  Laundering,  a  regional  body  associated  with  the  FATF \ntasked  with  promoting  implementation  of  the  FATF  40+9  Recommendations  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific,  and  committed  to  implementing  international  standards  for  AML/CFT.  At  the  national \nlevel,  Pakistan  adopted  an  Anti-Money  Laundering  Ordinance  in  September  2007.  The \nordinance  provides  the  legal  framework  for  AML  activities,  including  recognizing  money \nlaundering as a criminal offense and establishing a Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) in SBP to \nreceive  and  process  reports  of  suspicious  activities.  While  the  adoption  of  the  ordinance  is  a \nsignificant milestone toward greater transparency, further improvements are needed. First, the \nAnti-Money Laundering Ordinance provides for a cumbersome supervisory structure consisting \nof a national executive committee and a general committee. The national executive committee \nincludes relevant ministers, the SECP chairman, the SBP governor, and the director general of \nthe  FMU.  The  general  committee  includes  principal  civil  servants  from  the  ministries \nrepresented  at  the  national  executive  committee,  the  SECP  chairman,  the  SBP  governor,  and \nthe director general of the FMU. While the general committee is intended to provide assistance \nto  the  national  executive  committee  in  carrying  out  its  functions  under  the  Anti-Money \nLaundering  Ordinance,  it  is  unclear  how  this  is  supposed  work  in  practice.  One  national \ncommittee to develop policies and strategies for AML/CFT would be a better structure. The Anti-\nMoney  Laundering  Ordinance  also  envisages  that  the  director  general  of  the  FMU  be \nsupervised  and  controlled  by  the  general  committee.  This  is  inconsistent  with  international \nstandards and best practices as the FMU should have financial and operational autonomy. \n                                                 \n22 Under principle 18 of the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (2006) (Basel Core Principles), \n\u201csupervisors  must  be  satisfied  that  banks  have  adequate  policies  and  processes  in  place,  including  strict  \u2018know-\nyour-customer\u2019 rules, that promote high ethical and professional standards in the financial sector and prevent the \nbank from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, for criminal activities.\u201d  \n\n23 The  FATF  sets  standards  for  global  AML/CFT  efforts.  The  FATF  40+9  Recommendations  also  encapsulate \nrelevant  international  law  instruments  such  as  United  Nations  conventions  and  United  Nations  Security  Council \nresolutions.  \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nStrengthening Payment Systems. A well-functioning payment system is the backbone \n38. \nof any economy. SBP has begun implementing key payment and settlement systems reforms. \nHowever, although Pakistan has made progress in the development of electronic payments, the \nexisting retail payment system is still largely based on checks or cash. At the retail level, banks \nhave  focused  on  automatic  teller  machines  and  limited  internet  banking.  SBP  would  like  to \naccelerate  efforts  in  this  area  to  take  maximum  advantage  of  these  new  technologies,  unify \nefforts  to  prevent  a  proliferation  of  incompatible  systems,  and  develop  an  overall  and  longer-\nterm strategy for this area.  \n \n39. \nStrengthening  Consumer  and  Depositor  Protection.  Pakistan  has  witnessed  an \nunprecedented  growth  in  consumer  banking,  which  has  led  to  a  manifold  increase  in  the \ngrievances  of  consumers  against  bank\u2019s  products  and  services.  As  such,  better  consumer \nprotection  is  needed.  An  effective  deposit  protection  scheme  is  also  needed  to  ensure  that \ndepositors have continued access to their fund. This will help maintain public confidence in the \nbanking system  in  the  event  of  individual  bank  failures.  The  scheme  will  also  protect  the  SBP \nand the Government from pressures to bail out all depositors in banks.  \n\n \n3. \n\nOverall Growth and Competitiveness Concerns \n\n \n40. \nNeed  for  Long-Term  Growth.  As  noted  above  (paras.  11-15),  Pakistan  faces  major \nchallenges  in  a  globalizing  world  (Appendix  3).  Its  contribution  to  global  trade  in  high-value \ncommodities is negligible. The experience of the newly-industrialized economies in Asia shows \nthat  robust  growth  needs  to  be  sustained  for  at  least  2\u20133  decades  to  have  a  significant  and \nlong-term  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  With  increasing  links  between  more  sophisticated \nmarkets across the region and the world, the Government needs to set some clear targets for \nitself, and to develop the right policies and institutions. While there have been many studies and \nsome very good measures have been put in place by the Government, it needs to establish a \nclear corporate and business development plan to achieve structural transformation.   \n \n41. \nIncentives  for  Investments.  The  Government  has  implemented  reforms  to  simplify \ncross-border trade and reduce tax rates to stimulate investment. Nevertheless, the payment of \ntaxes  and  duties  remains  an  impediment  to  doing  business  in  Pakistan.  Businesses  need  to \nspend  about  2  months a  year  (560  hours)  to  comply  with  tax  regulations.24 Tax  administration \nremains  hampered  by  unduly  bureaucratic  processes  with  excessive  scope  for  discretion  and \nrent-seeking by individual staff, lack of adequate systems of financial and physical control, weak \nhuman resources, and an absence of inspection controls in customs. Discretionary powers need \nto  be  reduced  and  tax  assessment  and  collection  procedures  that  do  not  involve  contact \nbetween  taxpayers  and  tax  officials  introduced.  This  calls  for  better  use  of  information \ntechnology  and  risk-based  audit  systems  to  reduce  processing  time,  increase  administrative \nefficiency and transparency, and raise levels of compliance. \n \n42. \nLabor  Legislation.  Most  surveys  of  business  conditions  in  Pakistan  indicate  a  major \nconcern with the labor legislation. Businesses in Pakistan need to comply with from 72 to over \n100  laws  covering  such  issues  as  employment,  working  conditions,  payment  of  wages  and \nindustrial  relations.  The  resulting  complex  web  of  legislation  and  institutions  increases \ncompliance costs and decreases both employers\u2019 compliance with the laws and the employees\u2019 \neffective protection from employers\u2019 abuse. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 See World Bank. 2007.

ADB has been \ninvolved  in  all  the  areas  covered  in  the  AETP.  It  has  provided  extensive  support  through \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  as  well  as  through  loans  for:  agriculture  (sector  reforms  and \ninvestments  focused  on  rural  development  and  irrigation);  power  (largely  investments  in \ngeneration,  transmission  and  distribution);  financial  sector  reforms;  and  trade  and  export \ncompetitiveness.  Appendix  7  lists  all  ADB-supported  projects,  programs  and  TAs  in  areas \nrelated  to  the  AETP  agenda  during  1995\u20132008.  Table  3  shows  the  links  between  the  AETP \nagenda and ADB\u2019s past and planned interventions. \n \n\nTable 3:  Links between the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program  \nand Past and Planned ADB Interventions \n\nKey Areas \n\nAgriculture \n\nPast Interventions \n(1995\u20132007) \n\nAETP \n(2008\u20132011) \n\n\u2022 Reforms \n\u2022 Agri-business \ndevelopment \n\n\u2022  Reducing distortions in \n\nthe short-term \n(subsidies; state \nprocurement) \n\n\u2022  Targeted safety net \n\u2022  Reducing subsidies and \n\nElectricity \n\nFinance \n\n\u2022 Sector restructuring \n\u2022 Transmission \n\u2022 Access \n\u2022 Regulatory reforms \n\ndebt overhang \n\u2022  Strengthening \nsupervision \n\nPlanned Interventions  \n(2008\u20132011) \n\n\u2022  Irrigation \n\u2022  Rural infrastructure (farm-\n\nto-market roads) \n\n\u2022  Market infrastructure \n\n\u2022  Investing in transmission \n\nand distribution \n\n\u2022  Expanding access and \n\noutreach \n\n\u2022  Improving access \n\u2022  Economic diversification \n\n\u2022  Full implementation \n\nStructural \nTransformation \nLogistics \n\n\u2022  Trade \n\u2022  SMEs \n\u2022  Roads \n\n\u2022  Business plan for NTC \n\n\u2022  NTC implementation \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; AETP = Accelerating Economic Transformation Program; NTC = National Trade Corridor; SME = \nsmall and medium enterprise \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff \n \n45.  While  past  ADB  programs  have  supported  reforms,  there  is  no  substantive  overlap \nbetween  past  actions  and  those  envisaged  under  the  AETP.  The  AETP  builds  upon  earlier \nreform initiatives by reinforcing critical reform measures (e.g., reductions in wheat subsidies or \npower sector debt restructuring). In the financial sector, a recent ADB program25 supported the \nSECP and the consolidation of supervision of NBFCs. The AETP will build on this and will help \nPakistan adopt a framework for consolidated supervision. \n \nLessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s  experience  demonstrates  that,  although  political  disruptions \n46. \nmay  delay  program \nin  difficult  macroeconomic  circumstances,  strong \nGovernment commitment and solid support from implementing agencies can prevent a program \nfrom  becoming  derailed  and  enable  it  to  be  successfully  completed.  ADB\u2019s  extensive  and  in-\ndepth discussions with Government officials on the program design at the time of its formulation \nhas helped to ensure strong Government ownership of previous program reforms. Similar efforts \nwill be made in processing future programs. \n                                                 \n25 ADB.  2007.

Market participants should have market discipline and a good \nunderstanding  of  market  operations  and  the  virtues  of  regulation.  Market  supervisors  should \nhave the capability to evaluate the operations of market operators, establish appropriate rules, \nand ensure that market  participants operate in a prudential manner. It is particularly important \nthat capacity building and human resources development keep pace with policy reforms. \n \n48. \nA  program  will  yield  better  results  if  there  is  clear  and  close  coordination  among  the \ngovernment  agencies  involved.  These  agencies  should  collaborate  on  a  long-term  basis  to \nensure the sustainability and continuity of the development of a program. For example, while the \nSecond  Generation  Capital  Market  Reform  Program  identified  the  problem  of  fragmented \noversight over NBFCs, it did not focus on the role of SBP in addressing systemic risk concerns. \nOne of the key lessons from this program was the need to look at the entire financial sector in \naddressing  regulatory  and  supervisory  gaps,  regulatory  fragmentation,  and  arbitrage  concerns \nto  enable  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  longer  term  framework.  The  legislative \nframework  for  the  financial  sector  needs  to  be  amended  so  it  can  address  ongoing  financial \nsector consolidation and reduce systemic risks more effectively. \n \n49. \nThe  private  sector  needs  to  be  involved  in  any  reform  program,  since  businesses  are \nnormally the major beneficiaries of such reforms. Their involvement will help to create leverage \nfor proposed policy actions as well as to promote ADB\u2019s presence in the sector. \n \n50. \nA  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  institutional  mechanism  must  be  in  place  to \nassess the progress of the policy reforms against indicators; to provide feedback on the impact \nof  the  reforms  on  macroeconomic  stability,  the  competitiveness  of  economic  sectors  and \npotential investment areas, and reducing the insecurity of the poor and vulnerable groups; and \nto guide structural transformation leading to sustained industrialization. \n \nD. \n\nExternal Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n\n51. \nA  number  of  other  development  partners  have  supported  macroeconomic,  sectoral, \ncompetitiveness,  and  investment  climate  reforms  in  Pakistan  (Appendix  8).  In  preparing  the \nAETP, ADB has sought advice from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank \non macroeconomic stabilization measures. To help meet the financing needs, the World Bank is \nworking on a combination of investment and policy reform support operations to be delivered in \nthe  coming  months.  Other  bilateral  partners  are  supporting \nindustrial  sector  and \ncompetitiveness issues. The sector agenda in AETP has benefited from ADB\u2019s past work in the \nrelevant  sectors  as  well  as  ongoing  dialogue  with  the  concerned  development  partners  with \ninvestment or policy reform engagement. \n  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  proposed  AETP  will  help  Pakistan  achieve  and  sustain  average  annual  economic \n52. \ngrowth  of  about  8%  from  2010  to  2020,  through  a  process  of  structural  transformation  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  economy.  The  AETP  will  provide  the  fiscal  and  implementation  support  needed  to \nenable the Government to undertake and leverage reforms. The expected outputs of the AETP \nare:  (i)  the  removal  of  existing  distortions,  thereby  initiating  structural  transformation; \n(ii) strengthening  of \ntransformation;  and \n(iii) development and implementation of a national structural transformation strategy. \n\nto  support  structural \n\nintermediation \n\nfinancial \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nThe  proposed  AETP  is  structured  as  a  cluster  of  four  subprograms  over  2008\u20132011. \n53. \nSubprogram 1 attends to the urgent task of addressing the fiscal implications of the current food \nand energy crisis and short-term investment climate problems. It will initiate reforms that will be \ncarried  forward  in  the  medium  term.  Subprograms  2\u20134  will  build  on  these  fiscal  consolidation \nreforms  and  on  analytical  work  and  stakeholder  consultation.  These  subprograms  will  support \nthe  Government  to  implement  policies  targeted  at  economic  diversification  and  structural \ntransformation.  By  addressing  costly  and  inefficient  subsidies  in  the  energy  and  agriculture \nsectors,  the  AETP  will  provide  fiscal  space  for  the  Government  so  it  can  finance  overall \ndevelopment  efforts.  By  helping  to  raise  confidence  in  the  banking  system  through  a  stronger \nregulatory environment, the AETP  will mobilize financial resources and help to develop strong \nfinancial institutions that can channel investments to their most productive uses. In tandem with \na new industrial policy to diversify and deepen the industrial and export base, these efforts are \nexpected  to  initiate  an  economic  transformation  that  will  enable  Pakistan  to  sustain  high \neconomic growth. \n \n54. \nThe  key  constraints  identified  in  the  problem  tree  (Figure  3)  are  translated  into  three \noutput areas under the AETP (Figure 4, page 19). The AETP envisages immediate reforms to \nremove  pricing,  procurement,  or  other  finance-related  distortions  (e.g.,  debt)  in  certain  key \nsubsectors  such  as  wheat  and  electricity.  Reforms  are  also  needed  in  the  financial  sector  to \nboost  public  and  investor  confidence.  In  parallel,  Pakistan  needs  to  initiate  the  process  of \nstructural transformation of its economy. \n \n55. \nTable 4 (page 20) presents a snapshot of the principal program achievements along with \nresults indicators for key items under each subprogram. Appendix 9 presents the Government\u2019s \nLetter of Development Policy, accompanied by the policy matrix for the AETP in Appendix 10, \nlaying  out  the  policy  actions  for  subprogram  1  and  indicative  outputs  and  activities  for \nsubprograms 2 and 3. The activities for subprograms 2 and 3 will continue to be refined over the \nnext 1\u20132 years, while the agenda for subprogram 4 (for processing in 2011) will be formulated \nlater subject to satisfactory implementation progress. The indicators will be updated periodically, \ndepending  on  implementation  progress.  Appendix  11  presents  the  IMF\u2019s  macroeconomic \nassessment prepared at the request of ADB for the AETP.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs and Activities \n\n1. \n\nRemove Immediate Distortions in the Food and Energy Sectors and Protect \nthe Poor and Vulnerable through Targeted Safety Net Programs \n\n56. \nProtect  the  Poor  and  Vulnerable. Subprogram 1 will enhance awareness of the need \nto move from the current poorly targeted and inefficient subsidies in the food and energy sectors \nto a more targeted safety net system. The Government has set aside resources in the FY2009 \nbudget  to  provide  targeted  cash  transfers  and  food  support  for  about  5  million  poor  and \nvulnerable households. The targeted population will be reached by existing and new programs. \nClear  criteria  has  been  developed  for  selecting  beneficiaries  under  the  new  cash  transfer \nprogram. The application of the targeted safety nets for the poor and vulnerable households is \nin line with the reduction and eventual elimination of wheat subsidies, as set forth in the action \nplan  of  the  Economic  Coordination  Committee  (ECC). 26  The  Government  will  evaluate  the \n                                                 \n26 The  ECC  of  the  federal  cabinet  includes  the  ministers  for  commerce;  communications;  finance;  food,  agriculture \nand livestock; industries; information technology; petroleum and natural resources; ports and shipping; privatization \nand  investment;  railways;  science  and  technology;  textile  industry;  and  water  and  power.  It  also  includes,  by \nspecial  invitation,  the  special  assistant  to  the  prime  minister  on  finance  and  revenue,  the  Planning  Commission \ndeputy  chairman,  the  SBP  governor,  and  the  chairman  of  the  SECP,  among  others.

Subprogram  1  aims  to  complete  the  establishment  of  market-based \nwheat  pricing  and  a  more  efficient  and  transparent  wheat  stock  reserve  management  system \nbefore June 2010. A more holistic approach is needed that takes into account the food security \nconsiderations facing the Government. As part of subprogram 1, the ECC has adopted a time-\nbound policy action plan for ensuring a market-based wheat pricing regime and an efficient and \ntransparent reserve management system. The increase in the supply price of wheat for farmers \nfrom PRs425 per 40 kilograms to PRs650 in early 2008 was an important demonstration of the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to implementing the action plan. This was an important step toward \nmarket-based pricing, but an automatic adjustment process needs to be put in place to increase \nthe  support  price  to  80%  of  the  import  price  parity  level  and  this  will  be  pursued  under \nsubprogram 2. On procurement, as part of subprogram 2, the Government will lower its target \nfor  wheat  reserves  to  an  estimated  3  months  of  the  national  annual  average  consumption \nrequirement. This is an important step, as the Government has never been able to procure more \nthan 20% of wheat production in the past. The previous target, despite being unrealistic, exerted \nartificial  pressures  on  the  markets.  The  remaining  elements  of  the  market-based  wheat  policy \naction  plan  will  be  implemented  in  subprograms  2  and  3,  leading  in  the  third  year  to  market-\nbased pricing of the supply price of wheat and the pricing of wheat products; completion of the \nrestructuring of PASSCO and the food departments and directorates, streamlining management \nof the strategic reserves; freer movement of wheat domestically; and greater engagement of the \nprivate sector in the provision of key marketing infrastructure and services. Para.56 provides the \nmeasures that will lead to more efficient, transparent and accountable safety nets for the poor \nand vulnerable groups, including measures that address their food insecurity. \n \nTake  Measures  to  Address  the  Energy  Crisis.  Specific  policies  to  curtail  sector \n58. \ninefficiencies  are  needed  to  address  root  causes  and  consequences  of  high  energy  prices. \nAlthough the current global and national economic outlook poses complex policy challenges, the \nGovernment has already taken key actions under subprogram 1. These include: initiating work \non determining the extent of circular debt and debt overhang in the power sector, ensuring up-\nto-date  and  timely  payments  of  the  tariff  differential  subsidies  to  DISCOs,  and  allocating \nsufficient resources for energy subsidies in the budget to meet the forecast needs over FY2009. \nIn  addition,  Parliamentary  approval  was  obtained  to  reduce  electricity  subsidies  through: \n(i) elimination of generalized sales tax subsidies for all domestic consumers and up to 500 units \nfor commercial consumers; (ii) introduction of automatic monthly fuel price adjustments through \na  surcharge;  and  (iii)  introduction  of  an  additional  surcharge  to  be  levied  on  all  consumers  to \nreduce  the  gap  between  determined  and  notified  tariffs.  The  settlement  of  the  past  subsidies \nowed by the Government will cost $1.9 billion. Addressing the circular debt and debt overhang \nis likely to need another $3.0 billion\u2013$3.5 billion over 2008\u20132010. \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthen Financial Intermediation \n\n59. \nImprove Regulation and Supervision. Under subprogram 1, SBP has prepared a new \ndraft  of  the  Banking  Companies  Ordinance  to  incorporate  Basel  Core  Principles.  Draft \namendments include procedures for resolving difficulties faced by troubled banks, new powers \nto  enable  SBP  to  address  technological  changes  and  enforce  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework more effectively, new criteria to establish or liquidate a bank, and other measures to \nstrengthen bank governance. As part of the implementation of Basel II, SBP has increased the \nminimum capital requirements for banks from PRs2 billion at end-2005 to PRs4 billion by end-\n2007, PRs5 billion by end-2008, and PRs6 billion by end-2009 and adopted standardized and \ninternationally  accepted  approaches  to  credit,  market,  and  operational  risks.  Subsequent \nsubprograms  will  help  the  Government  to  fully  implement  Basel  II.  Also  under  subprogram  1, \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n\fSBP  has  launched  work  on  a  financial  sector  strategy  focused  on  banks,  including  reforms  to \nthe  overall  financial  sector  regulatory  architecture.  This  strategy  will  be  implemented  over  10 \nyears  and  key  milestones  will  be  identified  when  policy  actions  for  subprograms  2\u20134  are \nfinalized. \n \n60. \nAdopt  a  Framework  for  Consolidated  Supervision  of  Financial  Conglomerates. \nBasel  Core  Principles  provide  principles  for  regulating  financial  conglomerates.  Principle  24 \nrequires that the banking supervisor have (i) the authority and capacity to evaluate all risks to \nthe  group;  (ii)  legal  authority  to  review  all  group  members;  (iii)  authority  to  set  prudential \nstandards  for  the  group  and  to  limit  the  group\u2019s  activities;  and  (iv)  access  to  all  the  group \ninformation that it requires to meet its responsibilities. In line with these principles, subprogram 1 \nwill  support  cabinet  approval  of  draft  legislation  to  establish  a  regime  for  consolidated \nsupervision of financial conglomerates. The draft legislation provides that SBP will be the lead \nregulator over all financial groups that include a bank and that it will have appropriate powers to \n(i) license the bank and/or holding company at the top of the group, and (ii) set out and enforce \nprudential standards for the group through the licensing requirements for the bank or the holding \ncompany. The draft legislation also provides SBP with greater regulatory oversight powers over \nparties who control banks and banking groups, and gives it the power to license, regulate, and \nsupervise  all  deposit-taking  institutions.  Subsequent  subprograms  will  support  legislative \nchanges  and  implementation  of  the  new  framework  for  consolidated  supervision,  including \nstrengthening of regulatory capacity, and developing a strategy and related implementation plan \nfor  moving  to  a  more  functional  approach  to  regulation  to  address  the  risk  of  regulatory \nfragmentation and arbitrage. \n \nStrengthen  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Regime.  In  line  with  international  best \n61. \npractices,  subprogram  1  supports  cabinet  approval  of  amendments  to  the  Anti-Money \nLaundering  Ordinance  to  strengthen  the  independence  of  the  FMU.  The  amendments  would \nreplace  the  two  committees  that  currently  exercise  oversight  over  FMU  with  one  national \ncommittee  to  develop  national  policies  and  strategies,  enabling  FMU,  the  financial  regulators \nand law enforcement agencies to concentrate on operational matters. The FMU would serve as \nthe  secretariat  to  this  national  committee.  The  amendments  would  also  include  transparent \ncriteria  for  the  appointment  and  dismissal  of  the  director  general  of  the  FMU.  To  strengthen \ncapacity in the fight against money laundering, the AETP will support the adoption of a national \ntraining  program  by  the  national  committee  for  financial  regulators,  financial  institutions,  the \nFMU and law enforcement agencies. Subprograms 2 and 3 will implement the policy measures \nadopted under subprogram 1. \n \n62. \nThere is a current ADB TA for $1.5 million that will provide substantial capacity building \nand  training,  including  the  establishment  and  early  operations  of  the  FMU.28 This  TA  provides \nabout  32  person-months  of  international  consultant  inputs  and  30  person-months  of  national \nconsultant  inputs  as  well  as  support  for  workshops  and  other  training  activities.  The  TA  will \ncontribute substantially to the efforts of the authorities and the work envisaged for the AETP.  \n \n63. \nEnhance  SBP  Autonomy  and  Governance.  Subprogram  1  will  help  to  develop  a \nproposal for a new State Bank of Pakistan Act that will grant greater independence to SBP and \n\n                                                 \n28 \u201cStrengthening  the  anti-money  laundering  regime  in  Pakistan\u201d,  a  subproject  under  ADB.  2007.

This  law  is \nexpected to be enacted within the AETP implementation period. \n \n64. \nStrengthen Payment Systems. SBP has established a new real-time gross settlement \n(RTGS)  system  for  wholesale  transactions.  This  is  a  milestone  in  strengthening  payment \nsystems in Pakistan. In addition, SBP has also introduced a centralized online system for retail \npayments.  Subsequent  subprograms  may  review  and  update  this  system,  including  possible \nplatforms for electronic and cell-phone-based transactions and addressing issues of privacy and \nsecurity. \n \n65. \nStrengthen  Consumer  Protection  for  Depositors  and  Borrowers. As part of efforts \nunder subprogram 1, SBP has established a dedicated consumer protection department to deal \nwith consumer grievances and put in place an appropriate policy and regulatory mechanism to \nsafeguard consumer interests. In addition, a Consumer Protection Law is being drafted, which is \nexpected to be enacted during subsequent subprograms. This law is expected to address such \nissues  as  transparency,  confidentiality,  availability  of  statements,  account  servicing,  protection \nagainst  fraud,  unfair  contracts  and  lending  practices,  methods  of  debt  collection,  and  arbitrary \npenalties. It will be based on international standards and best practices.  \n \n66. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  a  concept  paper  has  been  developed  to  help  finalize  a  deposit \nprotection law as well as to establish a deposit protection scheme to protect small depositors in \ncase of a bank failure. The most important consideration for depositors is that their money will \nbe safe and available when they need it.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDevelop and Implement a National Structural Transformation Strategy \n\n67.  Medium  to  long-term  product  diversification  and  structural  transformation. \nSubprogram 1 will set the stage for an effective, strategic, and well-coordinated industrial policy. \nPolicy setting and identification of implementing institutions will begin under subprogram 1 and \nanalytical work on industrial policy structures and institutions will be carried out, to be supported \nby subsequent subprograms. This analysis will be based on a systematic understanding of what \neconomic  subsectors  need  and  how  they  may  be  feasibly  enhanced  by  specific  sector \ndevelopment policies.  \n \n68. \nThis policy analysis will have a special focus on public\u2013private sector interaction. It will \nfocus  on  feedback  and  consensus  building  in  (i)  institutions  for  public\u2013private  coordination  of \nstrategies  and  investments,  and  (ii)  structural  transformation  policies  carried  out  by  the  public \nsector. Two current ADB studies will support the AETP: one, supported by TA,29 will undertake \nan in-depth analysis to identify the potential to diversify production and increase productivity in \nlight of the country\u2019s technological and social capabilities; the other, supported by a TA loan,30 \nwill develop a strategic framework for new business development in key areas in the context of \nthe  heavy  public  sector  infrastructure  investments  along  the  National  Trade  Corridor  (NTC). \nUnder  subprogram  1,  a  high-level  steering  committee  reporting  to  the  prime  minister  or  the \ncabinet  has  been  established  to  lead  work  on  Pakistan\u2019s  structural  transformation.  The \ncommittee  will  prepare  a  work  program  to  guide  the  preparation  of  a  structural  transformation \nstrategy,  a  reform  and  investment  program,  and  an  execution  plan.  The  committee  will  also \n                                                 \n29 ADB.  2008.

Under subprogram 1, the Government has \ntaken  several  short-term  measures  to  improve  the  investment  climate.  It  has  introduced  risk-\nbased  customs  inspection  with  facilities  for  e-filing  and  payment  of  duties.  This  has \nsubsequently been extended to sales taxes. The Government has also introduced a pioneering \nprogram to support the development of the automobile industry, with the goal of increasing its \nshare of GDP from the current 2.8% in FY2006 to 5.6% in FY2012. \n \n70. \nAs  indicated  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  9),  future  subprograms  will  help  the \nGovernment  to  simplify  labor  laws  and  promote  e-governance  to  improve  delivery  of  public \nservices. It will also help to identify key sectors, prepare and implement development programs, \nstreamline the rules of business, and restructure some key ministries and agencies, based on \nthe recommendations of the structural transformation studies.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n71. \nThe  proposed  AETP  is  premised  on  three  key  principles.  First,  Pakistan  needs  to \naddress  certain  economic  distortions  in  the  short  term,  specifically  by  reducing  and  eventually \nabolishing inefficient subsidies and targeting them to benefit the poor and vulnerable. Second, \nPakistan  needs  to  deepen  financial  intermediation  and  increase  financial  sector  stability  and \nsoundness.  Third,  Pakistan  needs  to  diversify  its  economy  and  increase  the  share  of  industry \nfrom  the  current  level  of  26%  of  GDP  and  to  increase  the  share  of  manufacturing  with  high \nvalue-added.  In  parallel,  it  needs  to  increase  agriculture  productivity  and  make  its  services \nsector produce greater value. \n \n72. \nIt  is  estimated  that  Pakistan  will  need  more  than  $1.6  billion  to  transition  from  the \ninefficient subsidy schemes to a targeted cash transfer and food safety net program in the first \nyear of AETP, and about $3 billion to resolve the accumulated debt in the electricity sector. The \nAETP will help Pakistan to address the ongoing food and energy crisis in a systematic manner. \nSubprogram 1 is also one ADB\u2019s first responses to its developing countries\u2019 needs in the food \ncrisis, first announced by the President at the ADB Annual Meeting in May 2008 and contained \nin the Board information paper ADB\u2019s Response to the Food Crisis.31 \n \n73. \nStructural transformation of an economy of the size and nature of Pakistan\u2019s cannot take \nplace  quickly  or  through  rigidly  prescribed  conditions.  To  achieve  the  principles  laid  out  in \npara. 71,  the  AETP  sets  out  a  4\u20135  year  design  and  implementation  period,  and  a  cluster \nstructure of four subprograms that will provide flexibility to meet evolving circumstances. It sets \nout  short-and  medium-term  actions,  with  changes  to  come  beyond  the  program  period.  The \nAETP will only tackle the policy issues, with a large number of procedural and process-related \nchanges taking place in parallel to the proposed reform measures.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n74. \nAs  noted  in  para.72,  the  costs  associated  with  the  reforms  under  the  AETP  (which \nincludes increases in subsidies as a result of price increases in food and oil) are significant in \nthe short term, and can go up to $5 billion in FY2009\u2013FY2012 to expand the social safety nets. \nThe  Government  has  requested  that  subprogram  1  and  subprogram  2  each  be  designed  to \n\n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2008. ADB\u2019s Response to the Food Crisis. Manila.   \n\n \n\n\fprovide $500 million, with subprogram 1 to be submitted for ADB approval in September 2008 \nand subprogram 2 before the end of June 2009. For subprogram 1, two loans are proposed\u2014a \nloan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  a  loan  of  $200  million \nequivalent from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). Subject to reform progress and availability \nof resources, subprograms 3 and 4 are each envisaged to be $400 million\u2013$500 million. Thus, \nthe overall amount for the AETP is estimated to be in the range of $1.8 billion\u2013$2 billion. \n \n75. \nThe OCR loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \nrate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms \nand  conditions;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n76. \nThe  ADF  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n77. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the AETP. The Ministry \nof  Industries  and  Production;  Ministry  of  Commerce;  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and \nLivestock; Ministry of Water and Power; State Bank of Pakistan; Planning Commission; Federal \nBoard of Revenue; Engineering Development Board; and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal32 will be the \nimplementing agencies.  \n \n78. \nThe secretary of finance will steer the AETP. The financial management arrangements \nwithin MOF have been assessed as adequate. MOF\u2019s accumulated experience in implementing \na  large  number  of  program  loans  demonstrates  its  competence  and  capacity  to  carry  out \nfinancial management of the AETP effectively. ADB will monitor program implementation closely \nto ensure that envisaged outputs and outcomes will be achieved.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n79. \nTo  ensure  reform  continuity  as  well  as  the  predictability  of  support,  the  AETP  will  be \nstructured  as  a  program  cluster  of  four  single-tranche  subprograms  to  be  implemented \napproximately between June 2007 and July 2011.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSubprogram 1 (covering reforms from June 2007 to September 2008) addressing \nfood and energy crisis, supporting short-term investment climate measures, and \npaving way for medium-term structural transformation; \nSubprogram  2  (October  2008  to  June  2009)  furthering  reforms  for  structural \ntransformation; \nSubprogram  3  (July  2009  to  June  2010)  expanding  reforms  to  enhance  private \nsector participation in key sectors; and \n\n                                                 \n32 Pakistan  Bait-ul-Mal  is  a  semi-autonomous  organization  established  within  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and \n\nSpecial Education pursuant to the Bait-ul-Mal Act, 1991. \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\nSubprogram 4 (July 2010 to June 2011) marking completion of the initial phase \nof structural transformation.    \n\n \n80. \nThe  loan  of  $500  million  will  become  available  following  satisfaction  of  subprogram  1 \npolicy  actions  and  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  loans  for  subprograms  2\u20134  will  be  processed \nsubject  to  adequate  progress  of  reforms  and  the  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  the \nreform agenda.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedures \n\n81. \nLoan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member countries, other \nthan  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  12)  and  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures \nand  related  requirements  for  program  loans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will \nrequire  a  certificate  from  the  Government  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of \nPakistan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected  to  be  disbursed  during  a  particular  year.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of \nloan proceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n82. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  AETP.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations. \nTo mitigate the risk of corruption in the implementation of targeted subsidies, ADB will provide \nsupport  under  an  ongoing  TA  (footnote  27)  to  put  in  place  good  fiduciary  systems  and \nrequirements for the safety net programs. The TA will include 3 international person-months and \n12  national  person-months  of  fiduciary  expertise.  In  addition,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nexpertise will help to improve the safety net programs based on outcomes and lessons. \n \n\n5. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nThe Government shall ensure that the local currency generated from the proceeds of the \n83. \nOCR  loan  shall  be  used  first,  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and \nimplemented  under  subprogram  1,  and  second,  to  finance  expenditures  for  the  Government\u2019s \ngeneral development purposes. The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the ADF loan shall be used to support the poor and vulnerable households \nunder the two targeted social safety net programs set forth in output 1 of subprogram 1.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n84. \nThe economic reform unit in MOF and SBP have established a performance evaluation \nsystem for the AETP, which includes a database on the status of policy measures and program \nindicators based on the policy matrix. They will take the lead in monitoring the implementation of \nthe AETP and its impacts and outcomes, and submit reports to ADB twice a year on program \nimplementation, including accomplishment of the measures set forth in the development policy \nletter  and  policy  matrix.  They  will  be  proactive  in  gathering  data,  updating  performance \n\n26 \n\n \n\n\findicators  and  proposing  revisions  as  needed  to  ensure  that  data  compiled  provide  useful \nguides to management decision-making by policy makers. Policy advisors may be placed within \nMOF  and  SBP  to  assist  in  monitoring  and  evaluation.  ADB  will  keep  track  of  program \nimplementation through regular reviews and progress reports throughout implementation. Based \non these reviews, modifications and improvements will be considered. The results framework in \nTable  4  and  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in  Appendix  1  identify  the  targets  by  which \nattainment  of  the  outputs  will  be  measured.  In  addition,  each  subsequent  subprogram  will \ninclude an appendix reflecting a summary assessment of the performance of each subprogram. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n85. \nThe proposed TA will help the Government to design and implement the reform agenda \nfor  subprograms  2\u20134.  The  components  of  the  TA  are  aligned  with  the  principal  areas  of  the \nAETP  and  include  support  for  implementing  structural  transformation  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment. The design for this TA takes into account existing TAs and will be supplemented \nby  a  subproject  from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  governance  TA  cluster  (footnote  27),  financed  by  the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom. This subproject will focus on \nthe  design  and  implementation  of  targeted  safety  net  programs  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable, \ngradual  elimination  of  wheat  and  energy  subsidies,  and  restructuring  of  the  electricity  sector \ndebt. Supplementary Annex C presents the full details of this TA. In addition, an ongoing TA will \nsupport Pakistan\u2019s anti-money laundering efforts (footnote 28). \n \n86. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,040,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $800,000  on  a \ngrant basis from its TA funding program. The Government\u2019s contribution of $240,000 equivalent \nwill  cover  office  accommodation,  training  and  workshop  facilities  and  counterpart  support. \nProcurement of goods under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will help coordinate \n87. \nthe  work  of  the  TA  with  the  implementing  agencies.  For  the  financial  sector  component,  the \nwork will be coordinated and supervised directly by the concerned regulatory agencies. The TA \nwill  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  2  years  starting  in  October  2008  and  running  until \nSeptember  2010.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  require  about  15  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 30 person-months of national consulting services. All consultants will be \nselected on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The impact, outcome and scope of the TA, outline terms \nof reference, and cost estimates are in Appendix 13. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n88. \nThe  AETP  will  provide  significant  benefits  and  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor. \nAppendix  14  presents  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  prepared  for  the \nProgram.  First,  the  immediate  outcome  of  AETP,  particularly  under  subprogram  1,  will  be  to \nhelp Pakistan overcome the short-term exogenous shocks of spiraling food and fuel prices and \nmeet  the  immediate  and  large  fiscal  needs.  Second,  it  will  help  the  Government  move  away \nfrom  inefficient  and  untargeted  subsidies  to  a  targeted  safety  net  program  for  the  poor. \nBeginning  with  about  2  million  households  immediately,  and  expanding  to  cover  5  million \nhouseholds  during  the  2008-2009  fiscal  year  if  the  safety  net  program  implementation  is \nsmooth, the AETP could potentially target up to 9 million households. In parallel, the AETP will \n\n \n\n27\n\n \n\n\falso assist the Government in embarking on a medium term reform agenda. As such, third, the \nAETP will raise public confidence in the banking system through a depositor protection scheme, \nand stronger financial intermediaries that are better able to mobilize and allocate resources and \nrisks.  Fourth,  the  AETP  will  open  the  way  forward  for  structural  transformation,  and  in  the \nprocess,  it  will  help  cut  transaction  costs  for  businesses  (e.g.,  by  reducing  red  tape  in  tax \npayments) and improve the investment climate. Fifth, the AETP framework will enable ADB to \nsustain  policy  dialogue  on  structural  reform  in  sectors  where  ADB  has  been  actively  involved \nthrough past and current investments. \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n89.  While some of the risks of the AETP are political and outside of its scope, the financing \nwill mitigate a range of others, including the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nInterest  group  resistance.  This  is  likely,  as  those  affected  by  reforms  in  the \nshort-term  may  resist.  The  Government  is  adopting  a  good  communication \nstrategy to articulate the long-term and country stability interests that are behind \nthe  reforms.  Further,  the  program  cluster  nature  of  the  AETP  ensures  prior \nactions by the Government before financing is provided.   \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  Weak capacity. This is a generic concern, which is elevated in case of complex \nreforms. Adequate design and implementation support is being mobilized under \nAETP through technical assistance. \nGlobal food and fuel crisis. The measures under AETP are predicated on there \nbeing  a  global  recovery.  Yet,  the  program  cannot  determine  global  events, \nalthough it can help cushion Pakistan against some exogenous shocks. \nLack  of  policy  coordination.  The  AETP  will  demonstrate  the  clear  benefits  of \nproduct  diversification,  industrialization,  processing  and  value  creation  and  will \ntherefore  help  build  consensus.  ADB\u2019s  current  analytical  and  design  work  on \ntransformation is supported by well-known institutions, which will bring credibility \nto the reforms and help build momentum. \n\n(iv) \n\n  \n90. \nThe  risk  of  not  supporting  Pakistan\u2019s  safety  net  programs  and  longer-term  economic \ntransformation  is  also  high.  In  the  absence  of  timely  reforms,  the  Government\u2019s  budget  would \ncontinually  be  burdened  by  costly  and  inefficient  subsidies,  leaving  fewer  resources  for \ndevelopment financing, the financial sector would be vulnerable to systemic risks, and investors \nwould  be  vulnerable \nfraud  and  misconduct.  Without  meaningful  structural \ntransformation,  growth  may  once  again  be  stalled  and  macroeconomic  stability  disrupted, \nreturning  the  country  to  the  cyclical  pattern  observed  in  the  past.  High  and  persistent  fiscal, \ncurrent  account  and  investment  deficits  could  lead  to  unsustainable  levels  of  public  debt, \nadversely  affecting  the  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  environment,  constraining  investment  and \neconomic growth, and aggravating poverty. \n \n91. \n\nto  market \n\nThe underlying assumptions for the AETP include   \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nstrong and sustained leadership and commitment to reforms,  \ndevelopment partner coordination, and \nopen dialogue with the private sector and other key stakeholders \n\n28 \n\n \n\n\fVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n92. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken under subprogram 1, as set forth in the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, will be in effect for and beyond \nthe duration of subprogram 1. \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation  of  subprogram  1  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government  will  take  into \naccount ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposal. \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  generated  from  the \nproceeds  of  the  ADF  loan  shall  be  used  to  support  the  5  million  poor  and \nvulnerable  households  under  the  two  targeted  social  safety  net  programs  set \nforth in output 1 of subprogram 1. \n\nVIII.

The fiscal deterioration during fiscal year 2007/08 \nhas been serious enough for then incumbent (now resigned) Finance Minister to announce in a \npress conference after taking over that the fiscal deficit could rise to 10% of GDP if no mitigating \nmeasures  were  taken.  The  Government  has  since  then  taken  a  few  measures  to  restrain  the \nblooming imbalance through allowing a steady (but insufficient) rise in domestic oil prices since \n1 March, undertaking a small adjustment in the electricity tariff, cutting down of the Public Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (PSDP),  and \nto  government \ndepartments. Based on the provisional figures for the fiscal year 2007/08, the fiscal deficit rose \nto 6.5% of GDP, thus breaching the 4% of GDP fiscal deficit ceiling mandated under the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2005. The Government continued to run a revenue deficit whereas it had \ncommitted in the Act to eliminate this deficit by the 2007/08 fiscal year. The fiscal situation, if not \naddressed,  will  have  a  profound  impact  on  overall  macroeconomic  stability  and  growth \nprospects  of  the  country.  This  Note  summarizes  the  key  aspects  of  the  fiscal  challenge  and \nexplains underlying reasons for the recent deterioration.   \n \n2. \nContextualizing  the  Fiscal  Position:    Having  run  unsustainable  fiscal  deficits  in  the \nrange  of  6-7%  in  the  late  1990s,  the  Government  undertook  stabilization  measures  to  contain \nexpenditure  and  improve  revenues  supported  initially  by  a  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nFacility  (PRGF)  of  the  IMF  approved  in  2001.  Large  capital  inflows  in  the  post  September  11, \n2001  situation  provided  additional  space  to  the  Government  to  consolidate  and  improve  its \ninternal fiscal balance while maintaining robust levels of development spending. By 2003/04, the \nfiscal  deficit  had  come  down  to  2.4%  of  GDP.  The  deficit  rose  to  4.3%  of  GDP  in  2005/06 \ncontributed  by  additional  public  spending  on  relief  and  rehabilitation  in  the  aftermath  of  the \nOctober 2005 earthquake, higher subsidy on account of the rise in international oil prices, and \nrising  development  expenditure.  This  level  of  deficit  was  maintained  in  fiscal  year  2006/07  on \naccount of a precipitous increase in interest payments and continued expansion in development \nexpenditure. The deficit jumped to 6.5% of GDP in 2007/08 as total expenditure rose sharply to \n21.3%  of  GDP,  underpinned  by  an  increase  in  current  expenditure  to  17.5%  of  GDP.  Total \nrevenues on the other hand fell to 14.7% of GDP in 2007/08 from 14.9% in 2006/07, while the \ntax to GDP ratio stagnated at 10.1% of GDP (Table 1).         \n \n\n2006/07  2007/08* \n\nTable 1:  Summary of Fiscal Position (% of GDP) \n2004/05 \n13.8 \n10.1 \n3.7 \n17.2 \n13.3 \n3.9 \n3.3 \n\n  \nTotal Revenue \n     Tax Revenue \n     Non-tax Revenue \nTotal Expenditure  \n    Current Expenditure \n    Development Expenditure \nFiscal Deficit \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008.

The  fiscal  deficit  in  fiscal  year \n2007/08  shot  up  to  6.5%  of  GDP  from  4.3%  of  GDP  in  the  previous  period,  exceeding  the \ntargeted deficit of 4% of GDP for the year in a major way.  In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit in \n2007/08  was  81%  more  than  the  corresponding  deficit  in  the  last  fiscal  year.  Why  has  this \nhappened?  In  a  nutshell,  there  has  been  a  major  overrun  of  public  expenditure  that  has \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\noutpaced  a  significantly  decelerated  revenue  collection.  The  fiscal  issue,  therefore,  is  both  on \nthe  expenditure  and  the  revenue  side.  To  start  from  the  expenditure  side,  there  are  three  key \nfactors explaining the high overrun: large increase in interest payments; bloated oil, energy, and \nfood subsidies; and rising development expenditure. \n \n\n3.1 \nLarge  Increase  in  Interest  Payments:  Having  witnessed  modest  growth  in \nrecent  years  following  consolidation  of  the  total  debt  situation,  interest  payments  on \npublic debt leaped by almost 49% during 2006/07 on the back of lumpy payments made \non  maturing  high  interest  bearing  Defense  Saving  Certificates  (DSCs)  issued  by  the \nGovernment  in  the  late  1990s  (Figure  1).  In  fiscal  year  2007/08,  interest  payments \ncontinued their upward rise to reach PRs528 billion \u2013 surpassing the budgeted amount \nby  a  significant  margin  of  21%.  The  lumpy  interest  payments  will  continue  for  the  next \ntwo fiscal years and will continue to put pressure on the budget. Aside from the issue of \nlumpy  DSCs,  interest  payments  remained  high  on  account  of  the  growing  level  of \nabsolute  debt,  both  domestic  and  foreign,  that  increased  by  over  10%  in  2006/07  and \nanother 16% by end March 2007/08, as a result of the large fiscal and current deficits. \n      \n\nFigure 1:  Interest Payments \n(PRs Billion)\n\n527.8\n\n387.1\n\n273.9\n\n235.3\n\n226.3\n\n219.7\n\n260.0\n\n600\n\n550\n\n500\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n2001/02 \n\n2002/03\n\n2003/04 \n\n2004/05\n\n2005/06\n\n2006/07\n\n2007/08\n\n \nSource:  Economic  Affair\u2019s  Wing,  Finance  Division,  Government  of  Pakistan.  2008. \nPakistan Economic Survey 2007-08.

Altogether  the  total  subsidy  level  in  2007/08 \ntouched  PRs407.5  billion\u2014almost  four  times  more  than  the  budgeted  subsidy  level  of \nPRs113.9  billion  (Figure  2).  The  major  subsidy  heads  are  four:  oil,  power,  wheat,  and \nfertilizer.  The  unprecedented  increase  in  international  oil  prices  resulted  in  an  actual \nsubsidy of PRs175 billion \u2013 far above the PRs15 billion subsidy provided for this head in \nthe budget. The power subsidy arising from the tariff differential and other heads likewise \nrose to PRs133.3 billion \u2013against the PRs72.5 billion subsidy in the budget. The wheat \nsubsidy  on  imported  wheat  and  that  supplied  at  concessional  rates  through  the  Utility \nStores  Corporation  was  in  the  range  of  PRs40  billion  whereas  no  provision  had  been \nmade  for  this  in  the  budget.  The  revised  actual  fertilizer  subsidy  of  PRs29.5  billion  is \nPRs16 billion more than the budgeted amount.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nFigure 2: B udgeted vs. Actual S ubsidies for 2007/08 \n(P R s B illion)\n\n175.0\n\n133.3\n\n72.5\n\n15.0\n\n13.5\n\n40.0\n\n29.5\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nBudge te d S ubsidie s\n\nActua l S ubsidie s\n\nO il\n\nPow er\n\nFertilizer\n\nWheat\n\nSources:  Government of Pakistan, Finance Division 2007.

In absolute terms, development expenditure in 2006/07 was \nabout  19%  higher  than  the  previous  fiscal  year  (Figure  3).  At  the  start  of  fiscal  year \n2007/08, being an election year, a record PSDP of PRs520 billion was announced in the \nbudget that was 20% higher than the actual development expenditure in 2006/07. With \nthe  fiscal  pressure  imposed  by  interest  payments  and  rising  subsidies,  the  PSDP  was \nsubsequently  reprioritized  to  concentrate  on  fast  moving  projects  and  financing  for \nprojects that had not yet been started was suspended.  As a result, the size of the PSDP \ncame down by about PRs62 billion in 2007/08. Going forward, the PSDP will need to be \nmaintained at a level that is consistent with the overall fiscal position of the Government \nand availability of external financing. In the current tight fiscal environment un-helped by \nthe high and rising subsidies, protecting spending for important infrastructure and social \nsector projects has become a key challenge.  \n\nFigure 3: Development Expenditure (PSDP)\n(PRs Billion)\n\n433.7\n\n458.3\n\n365.1\n\n227.7\n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nB\ns\nR\nP\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2004/05\n\n2005/06\n\n2006/07\n\n2007/08*\n\n \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008. \nPakistan Economic Survey 2007-08.

But  the  tax \nperformance in 2007/08 was affected by the slowing down of economic activity and the \nFBR tax revenue target of PRs1.025 trillion, 21% higher than last year, was missed by \nPRs25  billion.  Total  tax  collection  by  FBR  grew  by  16.9%  in  2007/08  as  direct  tax \ncollection slowed, compared to its level last year, but still grew at a rate of 13.4% over \nthe previous fiscal year. But, as percentage of GDP the total tax collection by FBR1 fell \nto 9.4% in 2007/08 from 9.7% in 2006/07. Contributing to this jaded tax performance is a \ndecline in corporate profitability and political disturbances and the law and order situation \nresulting in closing down of businesses on several occasions in the latter half of 2007 in \nmajor cities. Total tax revenues consequently stagnated as percentage of GDP at 10.1% \nin 2007/08 and 10.2% in 2006/07.2 \n \n\nFigure 4: Tax Revenue - Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)\n(PRs Billion)\n\n713.4\n\n847.2\n\n990\n\n588.4\n\n411.4\n\n487.9\n\n513.5\n\n333.7\n\n378.2\n\n611.8\n\n176.9\n\n224.6\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2004/05 \n\n2005/06\n\n2006/07\n\n2007/08*\n\n    Total Tax Collection by FBR        Direct Taxes \n\n       Indirect Taxes\n\n* Provisional  \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008.

These \ninflows  allowed  the  Government  to  contain  its  reliance  on  the  domestic  banking  system  and \nnon-bank  sources  for  financing  of  the  deficit.  However,  external  inflows  slowed  down \nsignificantly  and  financed  only  17%  of  the  fiscal  deficit  in  2007/08.  The  result  was  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s  dependence  on  the  banking  system3 increased  dramatically  to  finance  83%  of \nthe deficit, of which major chunk was borrowed from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).   \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  Provincial  governments\u2019  collected  taxes  and  surcharges  on  gas  and  oil  are  not  included  in  the  tax  collected  by \n\nFederal Board of Revenue (FBR).  \n\nand surcharges on oil and gas. \n\n2  Total  federal  Government\u2019s  tax  revenue  includes  tax  collection  by  FBR,  provincial  governments\u2019  collected  taxes \n\n3  From  1  July  2007  to  14  June  2008,  Government  sector  borrowing  for  budgetary  support  from  State  Bank  of \nPakistan increased to PRs652 billion,  whereas, the scheduled banks owed PRs179 billion to the Government on \nthe  specified  date.  Therefore,  net  Government  sector  borrowing  for  budgetary  support  from  the  banking  system \nwas at PRs473.1 billion compared to only PRs163.2 billion in the same period last year.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nFigure 5: Sources of Financing of the Budget Deficit (% )\n\n83%\n\n56%\n\n31%\n\n13%\n\n46%\n\n39%\n\n42%\n\n30%\n\n24%\n\n19%\n\n17%\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n2004/05\n\n2005/06\n\n2006/07\n\n2007/08*\n\nExternal Financing\n\nDomestic Financing\n\nPrivatization Proceeds\n\n \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008.

Public  sector  investment  is  already  going  down  as  manifested  in  the \nslashing  of  the  PSDP  on  account  of  the  squeezed  fiscal  space  \u2013this  will  also  impact  private \ninvestment  and  growth.  The  fiscal  deficit  is  also  main  reason  behind  a  rapid  accumulation  of \ndebt.  As  mentioned  before,  domestic  debt  grew  by  15.8%  in  the  first  nine  months  of  2007/08 \ncompared to an average growth of 9.5% in past three years. At end March 2008, foreign debt \nalso increased by 17.2% compared to a 7% average in the past three years.    \n \n6. \nConcluding Remarks: Pakistan\u2019s fiscal problems in 2007/08 are predicated not only on \nrising  expenditures  but  also  on  stagnating  revenues.  A  strategy  to  improve  the  fiscal  situation \nwill thus need to rest not only on expenditure containment but also concrete steps to strengthen \nrevenue  mobilization.  On  the  expenditure  side,  leaving  aside  the  non-discretionary  interest \npayments,  the  Government  needs  to  make  a  strategic  resource  allocation  decision  regarding \nthe extent to which it wants to continue to allow expenditure on subsidies to erode and crowd \nout the PSDP.  The level of subsidy this fiscal year is approximating the (now curtailed) size of \nthe PSDP and this has implications for public investment for strategic development projects at \nthe federal and provincial government levels. On the revenue side, serious efforts are required \nto  enhance  the  tax  base  and  bring  the  agriculture  and  services  sectors  in  the  tax  net  while \neliminating  ad-hoc  tax  exemptions  and  rationalizing  the  burden  of  taxes  on  the  manufacturing \nsector.  The experience of  the current  year  with  falling  capital  inflows  that  has  complicated  the \nfinancing  of  the  deficit  only  serves  to  bring  in  the  limelight  the  challenge  and  need  for  raising \ndomestic revenues.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39 \n\nECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN PAKISTAN \u2013 WHAT IS IT AND WHY IS IT NEEDED? \n\nMacroeconomic situation \n\n \nI. \n \nPakistan has registered an average growth rate of 5.5% during 1960-2007. However, in \n1. \nper  capita  terms,  and  due  its  relatively  high  population  growth,  Pakistan\u2019s  performance  has \nbeen less successful, and between the mid 1980s and the early 2000s, the country\u2019s per capita \ngrowth rate showed a marked downward trend (Figure 1). Since 2001, however, this trend has \nshifted  and  it  has  improved  substantially.  Policy  makers\u2019  objective  is  to  maintain  this  good \nperformance in the medium term. \n \n\nFigure 1.  Annual Per Capita GDP Growth (%) \n\n1986  1988  1990  1992 1994  1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product \nSource: World Development Indicators. World Bank online database, 30 April 08.  \n\n \n2. \nAchieving this objective, however, is not easy, as the economy faces two problems. One \nrefers to the recent macroeconomic performance. During the last few years, there has been an \nthe  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  stability.  Growth  has  relied  on \naccelerating  erosion  of \nexpansionary  private  and  fiscal  sectors  and  a  contractionary  external  sector.  This  makes  the \ncurrent  growth  model  unsustainable.  The  second  problem  refers  to  the  underlying  path  of \nstructural  transformation  of  the  economy.  It  is  such  that it is  very  difficult  to  transit  to  a  higher \nand  sustainable  growth  path  along  the  lines  of  the  successful  East  and  Southeast  Asian \neconomies. Nevertheless, while challenging, the situation is not irretrievable. \n \n3. \nThe  past  three  years  have  been  beset  by  deficits  in  the  private,  public  and  external \nsectors. Figure 2 shows these macroeconomic imbalances. In the private sector, private savings \nhave  been  unable  to  keep  up  with  growing  private  investment  during  the  recent  high  growth \nyears.  In  the  government  sector,  the  tax  revenue  effort  has  stagnated  and  deteriorated  as \ngovernment  (both  current  and  investment)  spending  has  increased,  partly  spurring  the  current \nhigh  growth.  This  has  led  to  a  serious  fiscal  deficit  problem.  These  two  deficits  naturally  have \nled to large external current account deficits. Indeed, exports plus net factor income from abroad \n(the  latter  made  up  mostly  of  remittances  from  overseas  workers  less  foreign  debt  interest \npayments)  have  fallen  as  percent  of  GNP  in  recent  years  as  imports  have  increased \nsubstantially due to the country\u2019s high growth.  \n\n7.0 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n2.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n-1.0\n\n-2.0\n\n \n\n \n\n\fFigure 2.

This will free fiscal resources. \nTo  reduce  the  growing  and  large  current  account  deficit.  Ideally,  this  should  be \ndone  by  increasing  exports  (in  particular  their  quality)  and  by  reducing  non-\nessential/luxury  consumer  imports.  It  is  also  hoped  that  the  financing  of  the \nsignificant current account deficit will rely in the future less on volatile \u2018hot money\u2019 \n(portfolio flows) and loans, and more on foreign direct investment and productive \ngrants/aid;  \nTo  increase  private  savings  so  that  they  finance  to  a  larger  extent  private \ninvestment.

The  latter  consists  in  the  upgrading  and \ndiversification  of  the  production  and  export  structures.  Only  the  countries  that  succeed  in  this \nendeavor manage to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, and ultimately develop. \n \n6. \nThe development literature is filled with empirical evidence and examples that show that \nsuccessful  development  in  a  country  like  Pakistan  entails  passing  through  different  stages, \nwhere the essence is the transfer of resources from the less productive sectors of the economy \n(agriculture in general) to the more productive sectors (industry and services in general). At one \npoint, manufacturing (and industry in general) must take the lead in the growth process, as this \nsector is characterized by increasing returns to scale. Likewise, development is accompanied by \ntechnological  and  scale  upgrading of  the  products  produced  in  the  economy,  especially  in  the \nmanufacturing  sector  (as  the  successes  of  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  [PRC],  Japan,  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  and  Taipei,China  the  show).  Finally,  the  literature  also  shows  that  the \nsuccessful countries enter a phase of fast export growth during which they manage to upgrade \ntheir export structures significantly. \n \n\n2. \n\nLow industrialization and technological upgrading in Pakistan \n\nDespite  Pakistan\u2019s  relatively  good  growth  record  over \n\n \n7. \nits \nindustrialization achievement lags significantly behind that of other countries, especially those in \nEast  and  Southeast  Asia.  Pakistan\u2019s  manufacturing  output  share  in  GDP  is  much  lower  than \nthat of PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam.

Its  exports  per  capita  are  very  low, \nabout  $110  (Figure  5),  and  even  correcting  for  income  per  capita,  the  country\u2019s  exports  per \ncapita are smaller than what \u201cthey should be.\u201d \n \n\nFigure 5.

World Bank online database, 30 April 2008. \n\n \n11. \nAs noted above, Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing structure is tilted toward low technology and \nscale products. Given this, it is likely that the manufacturing structure will also be skewed toward \nthe same type of products. The question is whether it is possible for countries like Pakistan to \nmove  up  in  the  development  ladder.  Standard  trade  theory  seems  to  imply  that  indeed  it  is \npossible. This theory explains trade and production structures of a country based on its relative \nendowments  of  physical  and  human  capital,  labor,  and  natural  resources,  plus  the  quality  of \ninstitutions.  These  variables  determine  countries\u2019  relative  costs  and  the  specialization  pattern. \nAn implication of comparative advantage is specialization. It is a country\u2019s specialization in the \nproducts in which it has comparative advantages what raises the productivity of the economy. In \nthe standard theory, changes in the export basket are regarded as a  passive consequence of \nchanging  factor  endowments,  and,  therefore,  any  attempt  to  reshape  the  production  pattern \nbeyond the one set by the factor endowments is likely to fail and, even, to impede growth.   \n \n12. \nHowever,  recent  research  examining  the  patterns  of  sectoral  concentration  and \ndiversification  in  a  cross-section  of  countries  finds  a  statistically  robust  U-shaped  relationship \nbetween specialization and per capita GDP. It is found that as poor countries get richer, sectoral \nproduction becomes more diversified. This diversification process continues until relatively late \nin the development process, and, only after a country\u2019s income level reaches a threshold level, \nproduction patterns start to become more concentrated. The intuition behind this idea is that for \ncountries  to  be  able  to  manufacture  advanced  products,  they  must  have  mastered  the \nproduction of a relatively wide range of other products. This learning process provides them with \nthe necessary capabilities (e.g., production knowledge). This finding has a significant implication \nfor the development strategy for poor countries, since it suggests that economic diversification \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nshould  stand  at  the  center  of  their  development  strategy.  Figure  6  shows  the  specialization \nindex and per capita GDP of 14 Asian countries. Given its income level, Pakistan is still in the \ndiversification  stage  and  far  below  the  threshold  income  level  where  countries\u2019  production \nstructures  start  concentrating.  For  Pakistan,  economic  diversification  is  needed  to  bring  the \neconomy to a higher income level. \n \n\nFigure 6.

A  key  argument  is  that  not  all  goods  are \nalike  in  terms  of  their  consequences  for  economic  growth  performance;  and  that  the  current \nexport composition of a country can determine subsequent growth of that country. Specializing \nin some products will bring higher growth than specializing in others. \n \nTo  show  that  some  traded  goods  are  associated  with  higher  productivity  levels  than \n14. \nothers and that countries exporting higher productivity goods can perform better, we constructed \na  quantitative  index  or  export  commodity  score,  denoted  PRODY,  that  ranks  traded  goods  in \nterms  of  their  implied  productivity.  PRODY  is  constructed  as  a  weighted  average  of  the  per \ncapita  GDPs  of  the  countries  that  export  a  product.  In  the  second  step,  we  construct  the \nincome/productivity  level  that  corresponds  to  a  country\u2019s  export  basket,  denoted  EXPY,  by \ncalculating  the  export-weighted  average  of  the  different  PRODY  of  that  country.  EXPY  shows \nthe implicit level of sophistication of a country\u2019s exports. \n \n15. \nFigure 7 shows the evolution of EXPY for a group of countries, including Pakistan. The \nresults clearly show that Pakistan\u2019s EXPY has not improved, and the value has even decreased \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\nsince  the  mid  1990s.  Overall,  it  remains  low  compared  with  those  of  the  other  countries.  For \nexample,  India\u2019s  EXPY  in  1985  was  32  percent  higher  than  Pakistan\u2019s;  by  2006  it  was  74 \npercent higher. This means that Pakistan is stuck into the export of products being exported by \npoor countries.  \n \n\nFigure 7.

Why has the sophistication of Pakistan\u2019s export basket stagnated? This can be seen by \nanalyzing the PRODY measure. Table 1 ranks exports (products with a share of at least 1% in \nthe export share) at the SITC 5-digit level according to PRODY in 2005, and shows the share of \nthese  products  in  total  exports.  The  table  shows  the  top  17  exports  (according  to  PRODY), \nwhich account for over four fifths of total exports. Pakistan\u2019s exports are heavily concentrated on \ngarments and textiles. The highest PRODY is in \u201cFabrics, woven of continuous synthetic fibres\u201d \nwith  a  value  of  16,060.  This  value  is  approximately  in  the  middle  of  the  PRODY  scale.  The \nhighest PRODY value, at 31,288, corresponds to \u201cweighing machinery\u201d (obviously produced by \ndeveloped  countries).  Pakistan  does  not  export  (in  many  cases  the  share  is  literally  zero) \nproducts  with  a  PRODY  above  16,000.  However,  if  one  takes  into  account  Pakistan\u2019s  level  of \ndevelopment,  this  is  quite  an  acceptable  degree  of  export  sophistication.  The  problem  is  that \nafter the share of \u201cFabrics, woven\u2026.\u201d peaked at about 10-11% in 1990 and 1995, it declined to \n2.09% in 2005. On the other hand, the share of \u201cLinens and other furnishing art. Of textile, Other \ncotton fabrics, woven, bleached, dyed, etc.\u201d in total exports, with a much lower PRODY value of \n3,604 in 2005, increased from 11% in 1982 to 23% in 2005-2006. In other words, Pakistan has \nmoved into the low end textile and garment products, and this explains the overall low value of \nEXPY. \n \n\n14,000\n\n12,000\n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable 1:  Pakistan\u2019s Exports Ranked by PRODY (SITC 5-digit level) \nand Share (%) in Total Exports \n\nPRODY \n\n1982 \n\n1985 \n\n1990 \n\n1995 \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n46 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nCommodity \nFabrics,woven of continuous \nsynthetic fibres \nMedical instruments & \napp.exc.electro medical \nOther requisites for outdoor \nsports \nFabrics, woven of \ndiscontinuous synthetic fibres \nStockings, etc., knitted or \ncrocheted not elast. \nOther made up textile articles, \nn.e.s. \nWomens, girls & infts outer \ngarmts, not knitted \nMens and boys outer \ngarments, not knitted \nOuter garments knitted, not \nelast.

Producing new goods is quite different from producing more of the same \ngood.  Each  product  involves  highly  specific  inputs  such  as  knowledge,  physical  assets, \nintermediate inputs, labor training, infrastructure, property rights, regulatory regimes, and so on. \nThe exact set of assets and capabilities required is unique for each product, but this set can be \nan imperfect substitute for the set of capabilities needed to produce another good. To every pair \nof goods, there is an associated notion of \u201cdistance between them\u201d: if the goods require highly \nsimilar  inputs  and  endowments,  then  they  are  said  to  be  \u2018closer\u2019;  but  if  the  products  require \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n47 \n\ntotally different capabilities, then they are said to be \u2018farther\u2019 apart. The probability that a country \nwill  develop  the  ability  to  produce  one  good  is  related  to  its  installed  capabilities  in  the \nproduction of similar products for which the currently available capabilities can be easily applied \nand transferred. \n \n18. \nGiven  the  varying  degree  of  specific  assets  between  products,  the  speed  of  structural \ntransformation depends on the density of the \u201cproduct space\u201d (i.e., the range of products being \nproduced)  near  the  area  where  each  country  has  developed  its  productive  capabilities.  This \nmeans  that  the  country\u2019s  current  production  structure  can  determine  future  productivity  of  the \neconomy. If the specific capabilities used in the production of a country\u2019s basket can be applied \nto  the  production  of  products  with  higher  productivity,  then  the  country  can  easily  diversify  by \nshifting  to  rich-country  products.  Thus,  the  structural  transformation  of  a  country  is  path-\ndependent,  and,  hence,  justifies  government  interventions  in  shaping  the  production  structure \nfor the future development of the economy. \n \n19. \nBy  using  a  network  representation  methodology,  it  is  possible  to  construct  the  product \nspace  in  which  node  size  represents  world  trade,  node  color  shows  the  product  classification \nand link color indicates a range in the proximity values (Figure 8). \n \n\nFigure 8:  Product Space \n\nSource: Hidalgo, C., B.

Products  exported  by  a  country \nwith  a  revealed  comparative  advantage  greater  than  unity  are  shown  with  squares  (\n ). \nComparing changes of positions of the squares in the product space, we can analyze how the \nproduction structure or specialization pattern of a country has been evolved. Figure 9 shows the \nproduct space for Pakistan, Malaysia, PRC, and India in 1985 and 2000. \n \n\nFigure 9.

This  implies  that  Malaysia  will  easily  be  able  to  upgrade  its  production \nstructure  to  products  of  higher  productivity  in  the  future.  The  PRC  and  India  have  also \nsuccessfully  upgraded  their  production  structure.  By  contrast,  Pakistan\u2019s  production  structure \nremains  almost  same  in  2000  as  in  1985.  Pakistan  has  concentrated  on  low  productivity \ngarments and textiles, and cereals, and has failed to upgrade. \n \n22. \nThe speed at which countries can transform their productive structure and upgrade their \nexports  depends  on  the  path  determined  by  their  current  production  and  export  structures. \nPakistan\u2019s problem is that it has specialized in products that require assets and skills specific to \nlower productivity products, and which do not help in order to move to higher productivity goods. \n \nIII. \n \n\nPolicy Options \n\n1. \n\nThe Potential for Industrialization, Product/Technological Upgrading and \nProduct Space \n\n \n23. \nOur  previous  discussion  indicates  that  there  is  a  clear  need  to  plan  and  implement \npolicies  that  will  bring  out  and  facilitate  innovation  and  growth  in  the  industrial,  manufacturing \nand high productivity sectors of agriculture, services and industry. How to achieve this poses a \nsignificant challenge, and is actually the key to successful economic development. The analysis \nabove  points  some  directions  on  how  to  do  this.  Even  if  the  low-tech  group  1  (see  Figure  4) \ndominates  Pakistan\u2019s  domestic  manufacturing,  the  high-tech  group  4  has  the  second  highest \nshare.  This  means  that  there  are  sectors  that  may  provide  dynamism  for  the  manufacturing \nsector to take off.   \n \n24. \nTable 2 provides a breakdown of Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing sectors in the 1970s, 1980s \nand  1990s.  Low-tech  sectors  like  food  and  beverages,  textiles  and  apparel  dominate  the \nmanufacturing sector. However, their share is decreasing and these sectors are being partially \nreplaced  by  higher-tech  sectors,  especially  industrial  chemicals,  electrical  machinery  and \ntransport  equipment.  This  gives  Pakistan  a  golden  opportunity  to  increase  its  dynamism  and \ninnovation,  so  that  high  productivity  and  value-added  are  acquired  in  these  sectors  through \nproper  economic  incentives,  infrastructure,  specific  inputs  and  institutional/legal  setups  (to  be \ndiscussed in III.2). \n \n\nTable 2:  Pakistan Manufacturing Branches (%) \n\n \nFood and beverages \nTextiles \nApparel, leather, and footwear \nWood and wood products \nPaper and paper products \nPrinting and publishing \nIndustrial chemicals \nPetroleum and coal products \nRubber and plastic products \nNon-metal mineral products \nBasic metals \nMetal products \nNon-electrical machinery \nElectrical machinery \nTransport equipment \nOthers \nTotal \n\n1990s \n22.89 \n25.06 \n2.80 \n0.37 \n1.54 \n2.00 \n15.50 \n3.26 \n1.42 \n7.76 \n5.13 \n0.81 \n2.09 \n5.43 \n3.05 \n0.88 \n100.00 \nSource: Staff\u2019s calculations based on data from United Nations Industrial Development \nOrganization Industrial Statistics International Standard Classification Revision 2 (2005). \n\n1970s \n30.45 \n27.78 \n2.04 \n0.26 \n1.61 \n1.22 \n11.20 \n5.27 \n1.80 \n4.43 \n3.06 \n1.62 \n1.84 \n3.31 \n2.99 \n1.11 \n100.00 \n\n1980s \n30.94 \n18.14 \n2.37 \n0.39 \n1.15 \n1.06 \n14.29 \n6.01 \n1.80 \n7.75 \n6.20 \n1.06 \n2.14 \n3.26 \n2.89 \n0.55 \n100.00 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n51 \n\nPakistan  needs  to  rethink  its  export  promotion  policy  and  think  in  two  possible  dimensions. \n25. \nOne  is  to  grow  within  existing  products.  Pakistan  can  export  more  of  the  same,  or  upgrade  quality \nwithin  products.  The  suitability  of  this  dimension  depends  on  how  much  room  there  is  to  upgrade \nquality within the existing basket, and how sophisticated that basket is. In the case of Pakistan, the \nincome elasticity of demand for exports (a proxy for non-price or quality competitiveness) is very low, \nclose to zero. This indicates that when foreign income increases by 1%, Pakistan\u2019s exports increase \nvery little if at all. Why? Because Pakistan exports inferior goods. This means that there is plenty of \nroom for overall quality upgrading, as foreigners do not perceive, in general, Pakistan\u2019s exports as of \nhigh quality. Remember (Table 1) that even within textiles, Pakistan seems to be moving down the \ndevelopment ladder. The question is how to improve, and to solve this problem Pakistan\u2019s public and \nprivate sectors must draw a plan. A second strategy is to grow through more of the same. Table 1 \nabove  showed  that  Pakistan  already  has  made  inroads  into  some  high-tech  export  products  like \nwoven fabrics of continuous synthetic fibers, medical instruments and apparatus, and some requisites \nfor outdoor sports. Although the export shares of these groups have decreased in the 2000s, perhaps \nproper  policies  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  exports  of  these  products  and  make  them  more \ncompetitive in the world market. This is also a feasible strategy given that Pakistan\u2019s EXPY is relatively \nhigh given its level of income: Pakistan can grow within the existing export basket. \n \n26. \nA  third  possibility  is  to  move  from  existing  products  into  new  products.  If  Pakistan\u2019s  actual \nexport  basket  were  in  a  central  part  of  the  product  space,  then  there  would  be  an  apparent  and \nobvious  path  toward  new  products.  However,  this  is  not  the  case,  as  we  saw  above.  Pakistan\u2019s \nexports are largely textiles, and most likely the current export package is intensive in capabilities that \nare  not  easily  redeployed  to  alternative  \u2013more  sophisticated,  products.  In  this  case,  there  is  not  an \nobvious path to other parts of the product space, and a \u201cjump\u201d to a new part of the space is necessary. \nThis  requires  conversations  with  both  public  and  private  sectors  in  order  to  jointly  identify  these \nsectors. For example, the Ministry of Commerce has published targeted new export products that the \nGovernment would want to promote, namely, engineering goods, pharmaceutical products, carpets, \ngems  and  jewelry,  Japonica  (high  value-added)  rice,  meat  and  fruits  and  vegetables.  Feasibility \nstudies will be needed to see if these sectors are viable and whether the proper infrastructure, specific \ninputs,  institutional/legal  setting  and  economic  incentives  (discussed  in  III.2)  are  in  place  for  these \nexports  to  take  off  and  gain  world  market  share.  Box  1  provides  an  example  of  how  Singapore \ndecided to venture a few years ago into biotechnology. \n \n\nBox 1.  Building the Biotechnology Industry in Singapore \n\nAfter making significant strides in electronics, engineering and chemicals, Singapore is now turning biotechnology into its \nnext  manufacturing  pillar,  and  is  making  huge  investments  to  nurture  its  development.  In  the  middle  of  2003,  the \nGovernment opened Biopolis, a S$500 million research park that provides facilities for biotechnology activities and provides \nlegal  and  laboratory  support  services.  This  first  class  facility  is  envisioned  to  create  an  atmosphere  of  inspiration  and \ncreative thinking. It features, for instance, a S$33 million high tech airconditioning system which is planned to cool even \nopen-air  parks.    Besides  providing  physical  infrastructure,  government  initiatives  also  include  research  grants  and  tax \nincentives, funding startups, as well as education programs and scholarships to develop the workforce.  A chief executive of \na  life  sciences  consulting  firm  predicts  that  government  initiatives,  in  addition  to  already  established  pharmaceutical \ncompanies in the country, would allow manufacturing output to reach S$12 billion by 2005. \n  \n\nThe  country\u2019s  national  policy  of  attracting  foreign  talent  is  contributing  to  the  effort,  particularly  in  training  the \nworkforce. Some top scientists in molecular biology, cancer research, and neurology are already based in Singapore, and \nthe  government  encourages  long-term  assimilation  into  the  society.    The  country\u2019s  attractiveness  to  researchers  is  also \nhelped by a strong intellectual property rights regime and a well-developed health care industry. \n\n \nThe government recognizes the risks involved, such as the long period before investment returns are realized (if \nat all) and the threat of workers trained in its facilities to seek better opportunities elsewhere, notably the US, Europe, and \nAustralia.  But it is determined to move ahead as the changing economic environment calls for it.  \n \nSource: Wong, Douglas, \u201cSingapore\u2019s Research Heaven Lures Scientists,\u201d Financial Times, Jan. 24, 2003 issue. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n2. \n\nGrowth Diagnostics and Industrial Policy \n\n \n27. \nUndertaking  the  policy  work  discussed  above  requires  a  growth  diagnostics  approach. \nObviously,  industrialization  and  technological  upgrading  cannot  occur  without  increases  in \nproductive investments and capital formation in the proper sectors, especially since productive \ncapacity and technology are embodied in capital goods. The growth diagnostics approach aims \nat  identifying  the  binding  constraints  in  the  economy  that  prevent  investment  and  growth  in \npotentially productive and dynamic sectors of the economy and, ultimately, industrialization. \n  \n28. \nBottlenecks  or  constraints  to  investment  and  industrialization  in  the  productive  sectors \nmay involve general problems such as poor infrastructure, poor energy generation, bureaucratic \nimpediments,  difficulties  and  delays  in  setting  up  and  undertaking  entrepreneurial  and \ninnovative activities, as well as political/economic instabilities. \n \n29. \nBut  the  binding  constraints  may  also  take  the  form  of  lack  of  economic  incentives  for \ninvestment and innovation/technological and scale improvements in dynamic sectors. The lack \nof incentives may be in the form of:  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nlack  of  specific  inputs  (such  as  specialized  infrastructure  \u2013  e.g.,  IT-related \ninfrastructure  for  computer-dependent  sectors)  and  institutional/legal  structures \nto  facilitate  specific  economic  sectors  (such  as  the  lack  of  public  institutions  to \ncater  to  the  specific  technical  and  regulatory  needs  of,  for  example,  medical \ndiagnostics  \u2013  e.g.,  there  should  be  institutions  catering  to  the  training, \ncertification  of  good  quality  of  the  technicians  and  equipment,  and  legal \ninstitutions and procedures in case of charges of erroneous diagnoses). \nlack of human capital and specialized skills needed for specific sectors (e.g., the \nlack  of  qualified  engineers  or software  experts  due  to  brain drain  and/or  lack  of \ntraining/education facilities). \nlack of technical, R&D and technological investments and support for potentially \ndynamic industries. \nabsence  of \nto  productive \nentrepreneurial,  as  well  as  innovative  and  activities  with  the  potential  to  be \ntechnologically upgraded. \n\n(or  distorted)  economic \n\nincentives  given \n\n \n30. \nAll  these  possible  constraints  should  be  looked  at  in  order  to  come  up  with  policy \nsuggestions  for  manufacturing  expansion  and  product  upscaling.  Section  III.1  has  identified \npossible  potential  and  promising  sectors.  But  it  will  take  time  to  come  up  with  a  plan  for \nmanufacturing  expansion,  product  diversification  and  sectoral  upgrading  until  all  the  above \npossible binding constraints are sufficiently studied and analyzed. Box 2 provides an example of \nhow India and South Korea approached the implementation of an industrial policy program with \nsignificantly different results. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n53 \n\nBox 2. Industrial Policy in Korea and India \n\nJacobsson  and  Alam  (1994)  provide  an  example  that  shows  that  the  correct  implementation  and  design  of  a \nsuccessful industrial policy program requires not only a dose of creativity and experimentation, but also some \nclear guiding principles that combine a carrot to promote investments in nontraditional areas with sticks to wed \nout investment projects that fail. \n \n\nBoth  India  and  Korea  started  producing  hydraulic  excavators  (equipment  used  to  remove  soil  and \nstones) in the 1970s. Both countries protected these infant industries by restricting imports of finished hydraulic \nexcavators. Technology was imported through licenses. Protection was supplemented by requirements for local \ncomponent inputs, which became more stringent over time. Despite these initial similarities, the development of \nthe  hydraulic  excavator  industry  differed  substantially  in  the  two  countries,  and  the  way  India  and  Korea \npromoted their infant industries contrasts sharply. \n\n \nBy  the  late  1980s  the  two  Korean  excavator  manufacturers,  Samsung  and  Daewoo,  were  producing \nmore than ten times the annual production of Larsen and Toubro, the largest Indian excavator manufacturers. \nMoreover,  the  Korean  manufacturers  had  designed  and  developed  their  own  excavators,  which  were \ncompetitive  enough  to  be  exported  starting  in  1987.  By  contrast,  none  of  the  Indian  manufacturers  had \nintroduced an excavator based on their own design and none was in any position to export. \n\n \nTwo aspects of government policy in these countries are crucial in explaining this difference in industry \nperformance. First, although both governments guided private investment decisions in the industry, the Korean \ngovernment recognized the importance of economies of scale. It limited the Korean industry to two firms and \nallowed  them  to  expand  production  capacity  and  exploit  production  economies.  The  Indian  government,  by \ncontrast,  encouraged  a  large  number  of  firms  to  enter  the  industry  and  limited  their  individual  production \ncapacities in the belief that this would foster competition in an otherwise protected market. Second, the Korean \ngovernment  managed  to  instill  a  sense  of  competition  and  dynamism  in  its  two  producers  by  announcing  a \ncredible program of time-bound protection. Indian protection was not time-bound. This impending liberalization \nof  the  industry  was  the  main  factor  driving  the  Korean  firms  to  formulate  a  clear  strategy  for  developing  an \ninternationally competitive design for excavators and an export marketing plan. The cases of India and Korea \nreinforce  the  critical  role  that  greater  openness  after  a  limited  period  of  protection  plays  in  developing \ncompetitive infant industries. \n\n \n\n31. \nFinally, it is important to stress the importance of having appropriate institutions in place \nto interact with the private sector and learn what new activities are being considered and what \npublic action is required for them to successfully emerge. Box 3 summarizes the characteristics \nof these institutions. \n \n\nBox 3. Institutions for Industrial Policy \n\nAccording to Rodrik (2004), the following are the basic elements of an institutional architecture of institutions for \nindustrial policy: (i) Place political leadership at the top; (ii) Set up coordination and deliberation councils; and \n(iii)  Set  up  mechanisms  of  transparency  and  accountability.  And  he  proposes  ten  design  principles  for  the \nformulation  of  industrial  policy:  (i)  Incentives  should  be  provided  only  to  \u201cnew\u201d  activities;  (ii)  There  should  be \nclear benchmarks for success and failure; (iii) There must be a built-in sunset clause; (iv) Public support must \ntarget  activities,  not  sectors;  (v)  Activities  that  are  subsidized  must  have  the  clear  potential  of  providing \nspillovers  and  demonstration  effects;  (vi) The  authority  for  carrying  out  industrial  policies  must  be  vested  in \nagencies  with  demonstrated  competence;  (vii) The  implementing  agencies  must  be  monitored  closely  by  a \nprincipal  with  a  clear  stake  in  the  outcomes  and  who  has  political  authority  at  the  highest  level;  (viii)  The \nagencies  carrying  out  promotion  must  maintain  channels  of  communication  with  the  private  sector;  (ix) \nOptimally, mistakes that result in \u201cpicking the losers\u201d will occur; and (x) Promotion  activities need to have the \ncapacity to renew themselves, so that the cycle of discovery becomes an ongoing one. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSOCIAL PROTECTION AND SAFETY NETS IN PAKISTAN \n\n \n1. \nThe  National  Social  Protection  Strategy  which  aims  to  bring  social  safety  nets  to \n6.2 million households in the next five years was approved by the Government of Pakistan (the \nGovernment)  in  2007. 1  Pakistan\u2019s  existing  safety  nets  include:  (i)  cash  transfers  (Zakat, \nPakistan  Bait-ul-Mal\u2019s  Food  Support  Program,  and  conditional  cash  transfers);  (ii)  Old-age \nincome  security  (pension  for  Government  employees,  employees  old  age  benefit  institutions); \n(iii)  other  employment-based  programs  (Workers  Welfare  Fund,  programs  through  various \nfoundations);  (iv)  Micro  credit  and  NGO  programs  (Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund, \nKhushhalibank,  Rural  Support  Programs  etc);  (v) Public  works  Programs;  (vi)  food  based \nprograms (Tawana Pakistan Mid-day school meals); (vii) wheat subsidy; and (viii) social security \nprograms (pension - old age, survivor and disability and benefits to formal sector workers).  \n \n2. \nPrior  to  the  2007  Strategy,  there  was  no  overarching  social  protection  strategy  in \nPakistan.  It  obviously  led  to  lack  of  direction  and  poor  coordination  on  the  part  of  individual \nagencies and programs working in this area. The absence of a social protection strategy could \nalso explain the low and irregular budgetary allocations for the purpose. Public spending on key \nsafety  net  programs  is  only  0.5%  of  the  GDP.  This  is  low  by  international  standards  and \ninadequate to meet existing needs. It is hard to assess the effectiveness of these programs in \naddressing  poverty  and  vulnerability  given  a  lack  of  monitoring  and  supervision  system,  any \nthird  party  verifications,  and  feedback  loops  for  self-correction  and  learning.  Organizations \nimplementing  safety  net  programs  are  involved  in  multiple  activities  not  part  of  their  core \ncompetency  (running  schools,  hospital,  training  centre  etc.)  hence  thinly  spreading  limited \nresources and providing no synergies between agencies and program. There is no systematic \ntargeting  and  beneficiaries  are  selected  on  the  basis  of  administratively  determined  criteria. \nAd hoc selection process of beneficiaries, distribution system and discretion of the government \nfunctionaries  leaves  room  for  leakage  of  funds.  All  this  has  reduced  the  effectiveness  of  the \nprograms and lowered their credibility in public eye.2 \n \n3. \nPakistan offers income support through two cash transfer programs, Zakat and Bait-ul-\nMal. Zakat, managed by federal Ministry of Religious Affairs, Zakat and Ushr, is a State-based \noption  for  Muslims  to  meet  their charitable  obligations  through  a  deduction  once a  year  at  the \nrate of 2.5 per cent on the value of certain financial assets.3 It applies only to Sunni Muslims and \nothers  can  choose  not  to  be  included  in  the  scheme  and  make  their  zakat  privately.  Pakistan \nBait-ul-Mal (PBM) is a semiautonomous organization within the Ministry of Social Welfare and \nSpecial  Education.  Bait-ul-Mal\u2019s  objectives  as  stated  in  the  Bait-ul-Mal  Act  are  to  provide \nfinancial  assistance  to  destitute  and  needy  widows,  orphans,  invalid,  infirm  and  other  needy \npersons.  Unlike  Zakat,  Bait-ul-Mal  benefits  are  open  to  all  regardless  of  creed.  Also,  unlike \nZakat, the funds are entirely controlled by public servants. It has offices at provincial and district \nlevels that are closely linked to, but not part of provincial administrations.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Pakistan. 2007. National Social Protection Strategy. Islamabad. \n2  Draft  Social  Protection  Strategy  for  Pakistan  Presentation  by  Dr.  Pervez  Tahir  Chief  Economist,  Planning \nCommission,  Government  of  Pakistan,  at  the  Workshop  on  Social  Protection  in  South  Asia  17-19  May  2006, \nColombo, Sri Lanka \n\n3  A  Central  Zakat  Council  appointed  by  the  Federal  Government  provides  policy  guidance  and  general \nsuperintendence and control over Zakat funds. The Central Zakat Council allocates funds to the provinces roughly \nin proportion to their population. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n55 \n\nBait-ul-Mal\u2019s  main  programs  of  direct  assistance  to  individuals  are  the  Food  Support \n4. \nProgram,4 Individual  Financial  Assistance,  National  Centres  for  Rehabilitation  of  Child  Labour, \nVocational  Training  Institutes,  Tawana  Pakistan  (school  feeding  program)  and  building  of \nhomes.  It  also  gives  grants  to  NGOs  to  provide  institutional  support  for  orphans,  the  disabled \nand  abandoned  and  destitute  women,  and  the  aged.  It  also  provides  some  grants  for  water \nsupply. In the past, it has also completed a housing development for the poor in Sindh.  \n \n5. \nThe  PBM  programs  face  problems  of  poor  targeting,  fragmentation,  duplication, \ninadequacy,  poor  monitoring  and  sustainability. 5 The  government  has  laid  out  its  strategy  to \ndeal with these issues in the National Social Protection Strategy. The Vision of the Strategy is to \ndevelop an integrated and comprehensive social protection system, covering all the population, \nbut  especially  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable.  The  Core  Instruments  proposed  by  the \nStrategy  include  expanding  the  coverage  of  cash  transfers  using  conditional  cash  transfers \n(CCTs)  supplemented  with  unconditional  transfers  (through  the  Food  Support  Program  (FSP) \nand Zakat) among others. PBM is undertaking efforts to improve targeting, delivery mechanisms \nand  monitoring  through  a  number  of  initiatives.  They  are  in  the  process  of  cleaning-up  their \ndatabase and creating a comprehensive computerized Management Information System based \non  relatively  authentic  Computerized  National  Identity  Cards  (CNIC).  Developing,  piloting  and \nexpanding proxy  means tested targeting mechanism in combination with community validation \nis  expected  to  enhance  transparency  and  credibility  of  the  system.  Fiduciary  risks  are  being \nminimized through improved financial management and introduction of consolidated accounts at \nthe field level to ensure effective reconciliation.    \n     \n6. \nThe Government has announced the launch of a new cash transfer program in addition \nto the already existing program of Zakat, Bait-ul-Mal, and provision of food items at subsidized \nrates  through  the  existing  and  expanded  network  of  government-run  Utility  Stores.  The  new \nprogram, named after the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, is called \u201cBenazir Income Support \nProgram\u201d.  For  this  purpose,  the  Government  has  allocated  an  amount  of  PRs34  billion  to  be \nraised to PRs50 billion in the future. The program entails provision of a cash grant of PRs1000 \nper month to each qualifying household to be selected through a means tested program based \non  the  CNICs.  Relying  on  this  system  will  require  the  Government  to  address  the  coverage \nissues  of  the  CNIC  database.  Additional  TA  will  be  required  to  develop  systems  for  the  new \nscheme.  \n \n7. \nDespite challenges, it is clear that the Government not only has existing safety nets but \nalso intends to improve their coverage and targeting. The programs are expected to target more \nthan 5 million households. They have also substantiated their intentions by allocating substantial \namounts in the budget. Subject to improving systemic issues, the programs have  a significant \nscope and need for expansion. World Bank is working with the Ministry of Social Welfare and \nPBM to improve targeting of their existing programs. UN has fielded a joint mission to asses the \nsituation and propose immediate and medium to long-term measures in the wake of recent food \ncrisis.  \n\n                                                 \n4  Its  largest  program  that  provides  PRs2400-3000  a  year  for  persons  whose  income  is  less  than  PRs4000/month. \nThe  program  guidelines  require  that  assistance  be  provided  to  needy  individuals  following  an  order  of  priority. \nMeeting the criteria does not guarantee receiving the benefit as each district has a quota of recipients that it cannot \nexceed.  \n\n5  Asian Development Bank. 2004.

Wheat is the major Rabi (winter season) crop \nsown  in  October-December  and  is  harvested  in  March  to  early  May.  It  provides  70%  of  total \nproduction of food crops, occupies 37% of total cropped area, and generates 39% of the value \nadded of major crops. Production, which has been increasing since the 1990s, averaged yearly \nat 20.1 million tons from 2000-2007. Of this total, Punjab\u2019s share was 80%, followed by Sindh at \n12%, NWFP at 5% and Balochistan at 3%. In 2007-2008, the government projected a bumper \ncrop of 23.5 million tons.  \n \n\nTable 1:  Wheat Production and provincial share, 2000-2007 (000 tons, (%) \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n2000-07 \n\nPunjab \n\n16,060 \n(80) \n \n\nSindh \n\n2,409 \n(12) \n\nNWFP \n1,003 \n(5) \n\nBalochistan \n602 \n(3) \n\nPakistan \n20,075 \n(100) \n\n             Source: Agriculture Statistics of Pakistan; ADB staff estimates \n \n2. \nTable  2  shows  the  supply  and  demand  situation  for  the  period  2000-2007.  Pakistan  is \nmarginally sufficient, with most of the produce (roughly 65-75%) being kept by wheat farmers for \nhousehold  consumption,  feeds,  and  seeds.  Domestic  wheat  consumption  is  supplied  largely \nthrough the marketable surplus (mainly from Punjab) and partly through imports. Wheat is also \nexported but mainly to Afghanistan. In 2007-2008, government projected a huge bumper stock \nand  decided  to  export  some  of  the  produce.

In the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of \n2004-05, household expenditure\u2019s share on wheat products is 15.9%, the second highest in the \nbasket  of  17  major  food  items,  with  the  first  being  fresh  milk  at  17.4%.  The  response  of \ngovernments  in  the  past  and  in  the  present  has  been  to  intervene  on  one  hand  at  the  farmer \nlevel, specifically by guaranteeing wheat farmers with a price that would at least cover his costs \n\nWheat - A Political Commodity \n\n \n160.1 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n57 \n\nof  producing  wheat,  and  on  the  other,  at  the  consumer  level  by  ensuring  an  affordable  price \nthrough  subsidized  wheat  price  and  quota  allocations  accorded  to  the  flour  mills.  The  market \nshare  of  government  procurement  to  total  wheat  production  averaged  at  27%  for  the  years \n2000-2007. The surplus provinces, Punjab and Sindh, provided 70% and 10%, respectively, of \nthe  marketable  surplus.  Deficit  provinces,  NWFP  and  Balochistan,  provide  insignificant \nprocurement shares, while the federal government\u2019s wheat marketing arm, PASSCO, averages \nat around 20%.  \n \nTo  support  the  regulated  prices  and  procurement  activities  at  the  farm  and  flour  mill \n4. \nlevels, the government through its PASSCO, Trading Corporation of Pakistan, and the provincial \nFood Departments/Directorates, administers the trading and marketing of the wheat reserves or \nbuffer stock as well as the import and export of the commodity. These regulatory measures are \nsupported by state-owned storage facilities, procurement centers, and utility retail stores, as well \nas easy access to credit from the State Bank of Pakistan and commercial banks. Tables 3 and 4 \nprovide  indicative  amounts  of  Government  subsidies  for  wheat  price  stabilization  purposes  at \nthe  federal  and  provincial  levels.  Overall,  the  budget  support  for  performing  this  role  is \nsubstantial.  \n \n\nTable 3.

These  measures  included  the  removal  of  market \nrestrictions  in  trade,  elimination  of  consumer  subsidies  and  producer  support  subsidies,  the \nrestructuring  and  divestiture  of  PASSCO  and  provincial  food  departments  and  closure  of  food \ndirectorates,  and  a  streamlined  role  in  wheat  reserve  management.  Because  of  the  politically \nsensitive  nature  of  the  wheat  policy  and  the  volatile  sociopolitical  situation  in  the  first  half  of \n2000s,  a  phased  market-based  wheat  policy  was  deemed  as  the  most  politically  feasible  to \nachieve. The key elements of the phased market-oriented wheat policy are:   \n\n \n\n\u2022  Five-year phased policy reform of reducing the operational reserves to equate to the \nstrategic  reserves  by  5th  year.  Strategic  reserves  assumed  to  be  equal  to  1  million \ntons  \nImplement  a  price  band:  lower  limit  is  the  support  price  to  farmers,  and  the  upper \nlimit  is  the  price  accorded  to  consumers.  Within  the  price  band,  allow  the  private \nsector to undertake trading activities to farmers, flour mills, and consumers.  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  No restrictions of wheat trade at intra- and inter-provincial levels.  \n\u2022  No  restrictions  of  import  and  export  of  wheat.  Enable  private  sector  to  engage  in \nexternal  trading.  The  Government  imports  only  when  domestic  consumer  price \nmoves above it and private sector is not forthcoming.  \n\n\u2022  There was agreement that support price would move toward the export parity level, \nwhile  the  consumer  price  would  move  to  the  import  parity  price  level.  Price \nstabilization  function  would  be  only  performed  through  management  of  strategic \nreserve. \n\n\u2022  Blanket  consumer  subsidy  will  be  removed.  Instead,  a  targeted  food  safety  net  will \n\nbe developed for the poor and vulnerable.  \n\n\u2022  PASSCO and food departments are to be restructured.  \n\u2022  Agriculture  Pricing  Commission  (APC)  changed  to  Agriculture  Policy  Institute  (API) \nwhich, among others, would also monitor the pricing movements and provide policy \nadvice through good technical analysis. \n\n  \n9. \nThe  environment  during  2005-2007  was  an  opportune  time  to  put  in  place  the  phased \nmarket-based wheat policy reform agenda as there were no major internal e.g., major drought, \nfloods,  political  change  came  in  latter  part  of  2007  and  did  not  have  an  effect  on  the  wheat \nsituation, etc.) or external shocks that would have resulted in disruptions of the food supply and \ndemand conditions. These \u201cnormal\u201d conditions enabled the federal and provincial government to \ntry  out  more  private  sector  participation  in  the  trading  and  marketing  aspects,  particularly  the \ndomestic and external trade activities. Farmers also had the opportunity of more market options, \ngovernment  (at  GMP  price  or  procurement/market-based  price)  and  private  sector).  Prices \nreceived  by  consumers  were  fairly  stable.  Urban  incomes  were  also  rising,  thus  reducing  the \nconsumption  for  wheat  products  and  increased  demand  for  livestock  products.  Local \ngovernment\u2019s  coercive  measures  to  meet  procurement  targets  were  also  minimized.  More \nimportantly, consensus building between federal and local governments on the phased market-\nbased wheat policy resulted in agreements on the implementation of the policy.  \n \n10. \nAt  the  end of  ASPL  II  in  mid-2007,  the  gap  between  the  support  and  issue  prices with \ntheir  international  price  parity  levels  was  decreasing;  the  restructuring  plans  for  PASSCO  and \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nfood  departments/directorates  were  completed,  there  were  no  domestic  and  international \nrestrictions in wheat trade, and operational reserves were being reduced gradually.  \n \n11. \nFigure  1  plots  the  support  price  of  wheat  with  the  market  price  in  Rawalpindi,  a  proxy \nindicator  of  the  export  parity  price  at  Afghanistan  border  for  the  years  of  the  ASPL  II \nimplementation from 2004-2007. It is noticeable that the support price has moved much closer \nto the market price especially during the ASPL II years when the phased wheat market-based \npolicy was introduced (starting 2005). The price differential between the support and the market \nprice in 2004-2005 was PRs1,469 per tonne; the gap decreased to PRs863 per tonne in 2005-\n2006, or a 59% decline in price gap. By 2006-2007, the price differential between the support \nand market price was just PRs298 per tonne. However, at the height of the wheat price upsurge \nbeginning in mid-2007 (which also coincided with the completion month of ASPL II) and during \nthe  political uncertainty,  the  average  price  difference  jumped  to  PRs3,125  for  the  months  July \n2007-May  2008.  There  is  a  need  to  safeguard  the  policy  commitments  of  Government  to \nremove the support and issue prices for wheat and wheat flour, respectively.  \n \n\nFigure 1: Support and Market Prices, 2004-2008 \n(PRs/tonne)\n\n40,000\n35,000\n30,000\n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0\n\n2004-05\n\n2005-06\n\n2006-07\n\n2007-08\n\nProcurement Price\n\nMarket Price*\n\n* Rawalpindi market price as proxy to Afghan border price for wheat \nSource: Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock, Government of Pakistan \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  remaining  agenda  that  will  need  to  be  followed  through  are  found  in  the  following \n\nTable 8:  Unfinished Agenda of ASPL II \n\nPolicy Condition \nEliminate  consumer  subsidy  for  wheat  and  move \nto market-based sale price for wheat \n\nEliminate  producer  subsidy  by  moving  from  a \nsupport  price  to  a  market-based  price  for  the \nprocurement  of  wheat,  except  for  the  losses  that \nmay  accrue  from  the  minimum  strategic  reserves \nof wheat \n\ntaken \n\nto  reduce \n\nCompliance Status \nSubstantially complied in the sense that measures \nhave  been \nthe  operational \nreserves  and  move  toward  a  phased  targeted \nfood subsidy \nSubstantially  complied  in  the  sense  that  farmers \nare  given  more  leverage  to  sell  their  produce  at \nthe market price and not at the GMP.

A  confluence  of  global  factors  resulted  to  this  phenomenon:  high  food \ndemand  and  changing  food  consumption  patterns,  increasing  energy  prices  which \nencourage  shift  in  production  land  use  from  food  to  alternative  biofuel,  increased \nland cultivation for feeds, and structural neglect in agriculture investments.   \n\nthat \n\n\u2022  Mismanagement  of  stock  reserves:  From  the  viewpoint  of  the  public  at  large,  the \nrising wheat (flour/atta) price is perceived largely as the gross mismanagement of the \nwheat  situation  by  previous  government.  The  main  problem  was \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s issued price for wheat flour per 20 kgs was too low (PRs425/24 kgs) \nvis-\u00e0-vis  the  market  price  (PRs625/40  kgs),  resulting  in  increased  leakages  and \ncorruption, not to mention the huge subsidy cost incurred by the government (about \nPRs4.4 billion as consumer subsidy). Traders, flour millers, and households near the \nborders of Afghanistan benefited from the low price of wheat flour, but not the poor \nconsumers. Further, because of the higher price hike of coarse rice and maize which \nare used for animal feed, livestock farmers substituted coarse grain and maize with \nmore  wheat  use.  About  1  million  tons  of  wheat  was  diverted  to  animal  feed.  In  the \nend,  the  previous  government  had  to  import  1.7  million  tons  at  already  high  global \nprices, resulting in another fiscal burden of about PRs50 billion. \nIncreased  competition  between  public  and  private  sector  players:  To  some  extent, \nfarmers benefited from the high wheat prices. The private sector was quite effective \nat purchasing from farmers. The Food department of Balochistan for example, could \nonly purchase 2 MT out of their procurement target of 20 MT.     \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Tight Supply for FY2009: The present and newly installed government is thus under \ngreat pressure to act due to the very tight supply situation: Opening stocks for May \n2008 were down to 0.2 million tons. Latest estimates of wheat production are down \nto  22.8  million  tons.  Requirements  for  2008-2009  are  23  million  tons,  meaning  that \nstrategic  reserves  is  just  0.5  million  tons,  0.5  million  tons  short  from  the  desired \nstrategic reserves. Some argue that the strategic reserves of 1 million tons may be \nlow  as  this  was  an  outdated  estimate  when  population  of  Pakistan  was  below  the \n100 million mark.  \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n\u2022  Poor and vulnerable affected most by the wheat price hike: An ADB study (2008) on \nthe  impact of  price increases  on  Pakistan\u2019s  poverty  situation  concluded  that  a  10% \nprice  hike  in  wheat  prices  would  result  in  an  additional  7.05  million  poor  Pakistanis \n(in 2004-05, the number of poor was 33.35 million), at 20%, the number of additional \npoor  would  more  than  double  at  14.7  million,  and  at  30%,  an  additional  22  million. \nThe study also noted that subsidy for  the old and new poor would involve  a hefty \nsum  ranging  from  PRs18,537.61  million  (or  0.29%  of  GDP)  if  there  were  a  10% \nincrease in the food prices, to as much as PRs83,203.69 million, or 1.28% of GDP, if \nthe food price increases were 30%. \n\n \n14. \nThe second-half of 2007 when global food prices increased dramatically and global food \nreserves dwindled to low levels, thus became  the litmus test on Government\u2019s commitment  to \nsustain  the  phased  market  reforms  in  wheat.  Because  of  the  strong  profit  incentives  to  be \ngained from higher prices for wheat and wheat products, the Government, despite its efforts to \ndefend  the  public-determined  prices  of  wheat  and  wheat  products  and  its  use  of  various \ncoercive methods to restrict domestic trade and achieve its procurement targets, was powerless \nwith the interplay of market forces. The poor and vulnerable bore the brunt of high food prices \nand  inaccessible  food  as  the  Government\u2019s  food  security  strategy  did  not  have  an  effective \ntargeted safety net measure in place. The government also mismanaged its stock reserves.  \n\n \nHigh  wheat  prices,  increased  global  food  price  volatility,  and  heightened  market \n15. \nuncertainty  are  projected  in  the  medium-term.  There  is  thus  popular  pressure  on  the  new \ngovernment to revert to increased public role in the wheat sector as the way for ensuring food \nsecurity as demonstrated by recent policies of government:  \n \n\n\u2022 \n\nIncreased imports from 1 million tons to 2.5 million tons. But these will be coursed by \nTrade Development Authority through PASSCO and the food departments.  \n\n\u2022  Due  to  fiscal  pressure  the  food  departments  were  also  instructed  not  to  provide \nwheat  at  subsidized  rate  to  millers.  Punjab  has  agreed  to  provide  50,000  MT  from \nPunjab  flour  mills  at  the  price  of  365  PRs/40kg  (for  one  month  only)  these  will  be \ntraded by private traders- According to FD this measure will expose local millers to \ncompetition. \n\n\u2022  All provinces have imposed ban on inter province and inter district wheat movement \nespecially  during  the  duration  of  the  procurement  by  the  food  department- \nBaluchistan  province  has  applied  this  measure  in  3  surplus  district  for  15  days  but \nthe measure was lifted due to political pressure. In addition the measure did not help \nas FD could only procure 10% of the target of 20,000 MT for this year.  \n\n\u2022  Punjab  has  again  restricted  inter-provincial  wheat  trade  movement.  NWFP  cannot \n\naccess cheaper PFD wheat, but mainly PASSCO\u2019s more expensive wheat. \n\n\u2022  Exports  of  wheat  were  discouraged:  (i)  federal  level  \u2013  issuance  of  a  wheat  export \nduty  of  35%;  (ii)  coercive  measures  to  stop  wheat  exports  to  higher-priced  AFG \nmarket \n\n\u2022  GMP  or  support  price  increased  twice:  (i)  from  PRs450/40  kg  to  PRs625/40  kg, \nwhich  is  still  below  the  open  market  of  PRs700/40  kg.  The  amount  was  still  not \nsufficient to account for the rising input prices, especially fertilizers.  \n\n \n16. \nIt is essential that the investments in ASPL II of laying down the phased market reform in \nthe wheat policy be sustained and its implementation be accelerated. Key policy measures that \nwill need be brought to their logical conclusion are the: (i) elimination of consumer subsidy for \nwheat  and  movement  to  market-based  sale  price  for  wheat,  and  (ii) elimination  of  producer \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n63 \n\n(v) \n\nstreamlined \n\ntrade,  and \n\nsubsidy by moving from a support price to a market-based price for the procurement of wheat, \n(iii)  efficient  management  of  the  strategic  reserves,  (iv)  non-restrictions  of  domestic  and \ninternational  wheat \nfood \ndepartments/directorates  on  strategic  reserve  management.  These  should  be  complimented \nwith policies that provide targeted safety net measures for the poor and vulnerable groups, and \nmeasures  that  promote  new  financial  instruments  and  institutional  arrangements  for  the \neffective and efficient integration of the farms with the consumers through appropriate provision \nof private sector-run market infrastructure and services.  \n \nV. \n \n17. \n\nKey Desirable Features of a Policy Agenda for Sustainable Food Security \n\nTowards a common understanding of the meaning of food security: \n\nroles  of  PASSCO  and \n\n \n\n\u2022  Food  security  as  defined  in  the  World  Food  Summit  (Rome  1996)  is  a  situation \n\u201cwhen all people, at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, \nand nutritious food and to meet their dietary needs and food preference of an active \nand healthy life.\u201d \n\n\u2022  Food  security  is  measured  in  terms  of  (i)  physical  access  to  food  (or  availability), \neconomic  access  to  food,  and  biological  utilization  of  food  (food  absorption).  Many \nstudies note that in Pakistan, physical availability of food (including wheat flour) may \nnot be the main issues, but rather consumers are constrained by poverty or their low \nincomes that in turn, impedes their ability to use the food adequately for a balanced \nproper nutrition. \n\n  \nAppropriate direction of Food Security Policy:  \n\n18. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \nIn  the  short-term,  food  security  should  safeguard  the  food  availability  and \naccessibility  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  For  farmer  producers,  a  guaranteed \nminimum price (but indexed on both costs of production and the export parity level) \nmay be needed to enable farmers to reap some of the economic gains of wheat price \nhikes.  \nIn  the  medium-term,  food  security  cannot  be  sustained  through  provision  of \nconsumer  and  producer  subsidies.  Measures  that  enhance  economic  activities  and \njob creation would be a more sustainable basis for the poor to cope with food price \nspikes. Further, higher productivity of the food producing sector and its integration to \na  more  efficient  and  effective  integration  of  the  food  supply  chain  are  required \ninstead of distortionary price supports. Specifically, farmers need to be equipped with \naccess  to  (i)  high  yielding  seed  varieties,  modern  technology  and  agronomic \npractices  and  secured  water  supply  and  land  use  rights;  as  well  as  (ii)  access  to \naccurate  information  on  market  conditions,  market  infrastructure,  and  institutional \narrangements  that  effectively  link  them  to  the  domestic  and  global  market.  With \nthese,  the  farmers  can  make  the  right  choices  and  to  realize  profits  from  evolving \nglobal trading system.        \n\n \n19. \n\nIn the Pakistan context  \n\n\u2022 \n\n \nImmediate  and  priority  focus  of  the  Government  should  be  to  ensure  the  food \navailability and access of wheat flour especially for the poor and vulnerable groups. \nKey agenda for action are-  \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n(cid:131)  Build up the strategic reserves through a more cost-effective and market-oriented \n\nreserve stock management system. \n\n(cid:131)  Develop  and  implement  a  targeted  food  safety  net  program  with  a  time-bound \n\nexit strategy.   \n\n \n\n\u2022  The  medium-term \n\n(1-5  years)  agenda-  building  blocks \n\nfor  structural \ntransformation  from  low-based  food  to  integrated  food  supply  chains:  The \nGovernment should lay the policy, institutional, and investment reform measures that \nwill develop a market responsive wheat/food supply chain network.

Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  is  marred  with  twin  deficits  \u2013 \ntechnical/energy  and  financial/fiscal  \u2013  and  prevailing  power  shortages  underscore  urgent \nattention to prevent serious derailment of economy. Electricity sales rose 40% in the five years \nending  30  June  2007,  while  generation  capacity  remained  practically  stagnant.  It  is  estimated \nthat  the  system  lacks  about  5000  MW  to  cover  peak  demand  with  acceptable  reliability.  With \ndemand  expected  to  grow  at  7-8%  per  year  in  the  medium-term,  current  plans  for  capacity \nadditions  need  to  be  revised  upward  to  eliminate  shortages.  On  the  financial  front,  the  sector \nneeds  significant  fiscal  support  -  estimated  at  US$2.0  billion  for  FY2008  (close  to  20%  of  the \nprojected operating revenues and 1% of GDP) to cover the revenue deficit. \n \n2. \nThe  energy  insecurity  and  the  poor  electricity  service  have  been  identified  as  major \nconstraints  to  the  country\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  and,  hence,  it\u2019s  ability  to  alleviate \npoverty. The fiscal imbalances have created an inter-corporate circular debt problem, impeding \nthe  power  generation  companies  to  reach  optimal  production  levels.  Currently  the  financial \nhealth  of  sector  power  entities  is  precarious  caused  by  delayed  and  partial  implementation  of \nnecessary and agreed reforms. Tariffs must keep up with costs (of operating, maintaining, and \nexpanding the system) particularly in an environment of rising fuel costs given Pakistan\u2019s large \nthermal generation capacity. In the power sector, distribution companies have not been able to \ncharge  cost  recovery  rates  whereas  the  generation  companies  and  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs) have had real cost adjustments for their tariffs. The deficit amount is covered \nby  the  Government  as  a  subsidy  to  the  electricity  customers,  which  under  the  current  fiscal \nregime is not sustainable. \n \nTechnical  constraints  are  a  limiting  factor  in  evacuation  and  dispersal  of  generated \n3. \npower to the end customers. Transmission and distribution losses for the national system stand \nat  a  quarter  of  net  generation  as  the  power  supply  chain  is  over-loaded,  under-invested,  and \nunder-maintained.  For  2006-07,  every  1%  reduction  in  technical  losses  would  have  brought \nadditional revenue of some PRs4.3 billion (US$68 million) into the system at prevailing tariffs. \n \nII. \n \nThe  fiscal  issues  are  a  primary  cause  of  sector  deterioration,  and  its  severity  is  also \n4. \nnegatively  affecting  the  overall  fiscal  position  of  the  national  budget.  The  power  subsidy \npayments budgeted and to be paid by the Government, have reached unsustainable levels due \nto  sharp  increase  in  the  international  oil  prices.  This  is  accentuated  as  Pakistan\u2019s  domestic \nproduction,  catering  for  25%  of  country\u2019s  needs,  is  also  linked  to  the  international  oil  prices. \nConsequently, the power sector subsidies, the differential between the National Electric Power \nRegulatory  Authority  determined  and  Government  notified  tariff,  has  grown  substantially  by \nmore  than  400%  (from  the  budgeted  PRs25  billion  to  actual  PRs133  billion)  during  FY2008, \nprimarily  by  high  fuel  price  for  thermal  generation.  The  delayed  subsidy  payments  by  the \nGovernment  has  led  to  insufficient  capital  (cash)  in  the  power  sector,  making  the  power \ndistribution  companies  (DISCOs)  unable  to  pay  their  liabilities  including  purchase  of  electricity \nas well as limiting maintenance, augmentation, and expansion funding. This cash shortfall has \nspilled into power  generation  companies,  rendering  them  unable  to  pay  for  the  fuel  deliveries. \nThe next link\u2500oil/gas producers\u2500are being partially paid by the fuel distribution companies. As a \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nresult, a serious circular debt problem has emerged between the power utilities, fuel suppliers \nand the engineering industry. \n \n5. \nThis  circular  debt  situation  has  created  acute  liquidity  crisis  as  well  as  deterioration  in \nfuel stock levels. This has been continuing over the past few years resulting in a serious debt \noverhang  of  PRs220  billion  as  of  end  FY2007  between  the  DISCOs  and  the  Central  Power \nPurchasing Agency (CPPA) of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Ltd (NTDC). It \nis estimated that the debt overhang has now swelled further during FY2008. Weak governance \nhas resulted in inefficient utility operations, power theft, illegal power supply, reduced billing and \ncollection, and non-payment of arrears. Financial sustainability can only be achieved once tariff \nis rationalized, subsidies are phased out and balance sheets of the entities are cleaned. Poor \nbusiness practices have contributed to the build  up of the financial crisis which has significant \nrepercussions on the country's economy. Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) is \nat  the  center  of  a  public  sector  circular  debt  problem,  in  which  state  firms  and  government \nministries  have  failed  to  pay  power  bills,  while  WAPDA  has  failed  to  meet  obligations  to  them \nand to private sector creditors. \n \n6. \nSince  1992,  Pakistan  has  undertaken  power  sector  restructuring.  The  objectives  of \nsector  reforms  are  yet  to  be  fully  achieved:  (i)  private  investment  has  been  attracted  into  the \ngeneration sub-sector but after a high in the mid-l990s, there has been a persistent low in recent \nyears  (Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company\u2019s  privatization  has  not  borne  results  yet  and  the  ex- \nWAPDA  DISCOs  are  yet  to  be  privatized),  (ii)  quality  of  service  to  the  end-user  has  been \ncompromised  significantly  by  power  shortages  (during  peak  demand  summer  months,  power \nriots  have  been  witnessed)  and  by  over-loading  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  networks, \n(iii) sector financial strength has not been achieved and instead of being a net contributor to the \nnational treasury, the sector creates a fiscal burden to the tune of $2 billion/year. The successful \nimplementation  of  reforms  becomes  even  more  important  as  the  Government  seeks  to  attract \nlarge  private  sector  participation  in  developing  and  funding  the  current  and  future  power \ngeneration and system requirements in Pakistan. The reform agenda clearly has some way to \ngo. The immediate steps include corporate autonomy and sector governance, electricity trading, \nand financial management, among others. \n \nTherefore  ADB\u2019s  assistance  should  address  the  fiscal  sector  imbalances  as  the  first \n7. \npriority to ensure sufficient liquidity in the sector and to curtail the current circular debt issues. It \nis  essential  to  determine  the  actual  amount  of  the  debt  overhang,  isolate  it,  and  develop  a \npractical  debt  restructuring  plan  acceptable  to  all  stakeholders.  It  is  expected  that  an \nimplementation of the debt restructuring plan would span several years.  Parallel to addressing \nthe  fiscal  aspects,  the  current  technical  short-comings  need  to  be  aggressively  tackled. \nCurrently  the  Government  is  moving  rapidly  trying  to  address  the  short-term  generation  crisis, \nand ensuring sufficient funding for NTDC and the DISCOs for improvements in the transmission \nand  distribution  systems.  There  are  needs  in  terms  of  knowledge  products  and  financing  of \nbasically all technical areas of the power sector, but most importantly the Government need to \nensure that the fiscal energy sector matters are appropriately addressed to eliminate substantial \nenergy sector subsidy requirements. \n \n8. \nEnergy  security  is  becoming  a  major  concern  globally,  second  to  food  security.  This  is \nclearly recognized by the country\u2019s Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF). The sector \nremains  institutionally  fragmented,  lacks  integrated  energy  planning  to  analyze/develop  a \nconsolidated  action  plan  and  address  the  country\u2019s  energy  needs  in  short,  medium  and  long \nterm.  The  sector  is  managed  by  the  Ministries  of  Petroleum  &  Natural  Resources,  Water  & \nPower,  Planning  &  Development,  Environment,  Transport  and  Communications,  and  Pakistan \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n67 \n\nAtomic  Energy  Commission.  There  are  separate  regulatory  bodies  for  oil  &  gas  and  electric \npower. No single ministry or regulatory body has over-arching responsibility and accountability \nfor energy. \n \nAn  integrated  model  interlinking  the  different  components  of  the  energy  chain  is \n9. \nnecessary for effective analysis and evaluation of the different options. Such a model will show \nwhether the current practice of transporting imported oil upcountry for power plants after adding \nthe economic cost of transportation, i.e. the impact on the overstretched road infrastructure is a \nlower cost option than building the power plants at the port and transmitting bulk power at high \nvoltage. Similarly it would help the country\u2019s economic managers in allocating scarce resources \nsuch as natural gas or answer questions being raised on subsidizing Compressed Natural Gas \n(CNG) as replacement for gasoline and its impact on refinery economics and the government\u2019s \nbudget.  Given  the  strong  link  between  the  petroleum  and  the  power  sub-sectors  the  pricing \nregime  of  petroleum  products  impacts  the  cost  of  power  and  the  different  subsidies  and \nconcession the Government provides to consumers for social considerations or for the industry \nto maintain its competitiveness. Industry in Pakistan is currently disadvantaged, compared to its \ncounterpart in other countries, by the energy tariffs which have built in cross subsidies from the \nindustrial to domestic and agricultural consumers. \n \n10. \nAn integrated look will help develop a least cost approach to energy policy and pricing \nand  minimize  the  cost  of  subsidies.  Once  true  economic  costs  and  benefits  are  established, \nissues such as pricing of peak power or using captive power can be effectively addressed. The \nviability  of  alternate  energy  and  premium,  if  any,  that  the  country  should  pay  for  diversifying \nsources  to  reduce  supply  risk,  can  be  rationalized.  An  empowered  and  effective  link  between \nthe  planners  and  those  who  implement  these  plans  will  ensure  improved  information  for \ndecision making, realistic planning and faster implementation of projects. It should lead to faster \nand  timely  response  to  changes  in  domestic  and  geopolitical  realities.  The  country  needs  to \nstart  thinking  in  terms  of  energy  rather  than  gas,  oil,  coal  and  electricity.  This  is  necessary  to \nmake  the  MTDF  and  Vision  2030  goal  of  Energy  Security,  which  means  ensured  energy \navailability at lowest possible cost, a reality. \n \n11. \nUnder  Pakistan  Accelerated  Economic  Transformation  Program,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will \nfocus  on  addressing  the  fiscal  imbalances  in  the  power  sector,  complemented  by  integrated \nplanning  approach  to  the  sector,  which  ADB  is  assisting  through  an  under  implementation \nAdvisory Technical Assistance.  \n \nIII. \n \n12. \nFollowing  extensive  discussions  with  the  Government  it  was  mutually  agreed  that  the \nProgram would address the major fiscal areas related to the power sector. These specific areas \nincorporated in subprogram 1 include: \n\nProgram Components related to the Energy Sector \n\n \n\u2022  Parliamentary  approval  obtained \n\nto \n\nthrough: \n(i) elimination of generalized sales tax subsidies for all domestic consumers and up \nto  500  units  for  commercial  consumers;  (ii)  introduction  of  automatic  monthly  fuel \nprice  adjustments  through  a  surcharge;  and  (iii)  introduction  of  an  additional \nsurcharge to be levied on all consumers to reduce the gap between determined and \nnotified tariffs. \n\nreduce  electricity  subsidies \n\n\u2022  Work on estimation of power sector debt overhang and circular debt initiated. \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n\u2022  All  past  electricity  subsidy  payments  (PRs133  billion  for  FY2008)  fully  settled,  and \nPRs88  billion  allocated  in  the  FY2009  budget  to  partially  cover  the  difference \nbetween determined and notified tariffs [for FY 2009]. \n\nOutcome of the Energy Sector Components \n\n \nThe component focuses on actual payments of funds and timing of cash flows, ensuring \n13. \nthat power sector remains liquid to pay its current obligations and invest in system maintenance, \nexpansion and augmentation. This is true for the current portion of the  subsidy payments and \nthe immediate future requirements. Furthermore, the approach establishes the actual amounts \nof  the  circular  debt  and  debt  overhang.  After  the  amounts  have  been  established,  the \nGovernment  is  in  a  position  to  address  subsequent  financial  issues  and  undertake  least  cost \nsystem expansion through an integrated energy planning. \n \nIV. \n \n14. \nThe  objectives  in  terms  of  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  components  in  the  Program  are  (i)  to \ntransparently  establish  the  subsidy  requirements  arising  from  current  subsidy  policies  and \ndecisions and ensure that these requirements are fully funded through national budget and duly \npaid  to  respective  agencies/companies,  and  (ii)  establish  the  non-sustainability  of  subsidy \nrequirements and subsequently move towards automatic fuel cost pass-through mechanisms on \na  timely  basis,  wherein  tariff  levels  closely  matching  the  actual  cost  of  supply,  and  focus  on \nlimited and targeted subsidies. The policy dialog with Government related to both the objectives \nhas been positive in achieving these objectives. The Government has already initiated requisite \nsteps  in  the  right  direction  including  provision  of  adequate  subsidies,  measures  to  rationalize \ntariffs  and  move  towards  monthly  adjustment  of  tariffs  through  the  recently  approved  Finance \nBill 2008.   \n \n15. \nIn terms of direct outcome, it is expected that all subsidies would be paid by MOF to the \nDISCOs,  leading  to  a  healthy  liquidity  position  in  DISCOs  to  allow  them  to  fully  pay  for  the \nelectricity purchases from CPPA/NTDC. In turn, this would make CPPA capable of fulfilling its \nfinancial obligations with the generation companies, who again would be able to settle with the \nfuel  suppliers.  The  short  to  medium  term  result  would  be  the  elimination  of  the  circular  debt. \nMore important the power generating companies will be able to procure sufficient fuel stocks to \nrun the plants at their maximum levels, which would increase supply by at least 1500 MW. \n \n16. \nThe  success  in  attracting  private  investment  to  a  certain  extent  depends  on  financial \nstrength of the contracting public sector. Fully addressing both the circular debt position and the \ndebt overhang issue would result in an increased attractiveness by potential buyers of energy \nsector  companies.  The  current  account  deficit  could  be  reduced  by  increased  FDI,  and \nprivatization  of  energy  sector  companies,  both  in  the  power  and  gas  sub-sectors,  would  be  a \ngood  source  of  funds  provided  the  fiscal  position  is  made  transparent  and  sustainable.  The \nexpected  outcome  is  fiscal  neutrality  within  the  energy  sector,  which  would  lead  to  increased \nability  of  the  Government  to  present  additional  energy  sector  entities  to  the  market  and \nincreased interest from potential investors to purchase these entities. It is also expected that the \nprice obtained for the entities would increase from the elimination of the circular debt and actual \ntimely subsidy payments by MOF. \n \nV. \n \n17. \nIn the past the Government has been able to address fiscal deficits and imbalances in \nthe energy sector, through interventions and assistance of multilateral institutions. This positive \nexperience leads to a continued focus on these two areas dealing with continuous payment of \n\nContinuation of the Energy Sector Components \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n69 \n\nsubsidies, as required, and make adequate allocations in future national budgets. Accordingly, \nthese  two  actions  are  imbedded  in  subsequent  subprograms  to  ensure  continuation  of  fiscal \ndiscipline  and  subsequent  tranches  would  not  be  released  without  complying  by  these  two \ndisbursement requirements. \n \n18. \nIn  terms  of  the  debt  overhang,  a  debt  restructuring  plan  must  be  developed  and \nimplemented  through  the  Program  period.  By  the  consideration  of  subprogram  2  the  debt \nrestructuring  plan  should  be  approved  and \nimplementation  should  have  started.  By \nconsideration of subprogram 3 it is expected that implementation of the debt restructuring plan \nis well underway towards closure. \n \n\nTo address the current technical shortcomings in the sector, the Government would be \n19. \nrequired  to  contract  for  electricity  supply  from  new  generation  stations  running  on  fuel  oil.  By \nsubprogram  2  the  Government  should  have  undertaken  the  calculations  of  the  future  subsidy \nrequirements taking into account the current tariff and subsidy policies, and arrive at its impacts \non  the  national  economy.  ADB  remains  Pakistan's  largest  development  partner  in  Energy \nSector  and  has  strong  presence  (through  investment  projects  and  analytical  and  project \npreparatory  assistance)  across  the  power  supply  chain  in  the  country.  ADB  is  simultaneously \naddressing the sector inefficiencies and remains committed to address sector inefficiencies. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nADB PROJECTS IN AREAS RELATED TO AETP AGENDA 1995-2008 \n \nTable 1.

The impact of the TA is \nthe  facilitation  of  economic  transformation  in  Pakistan.  The  TA  outputs  will  include  a  well-\nsequenced  reform  agenda  and  greater  consensus  amongst  the  policy  makers  and  relevant \nstakeholders on the need for, and approaches to, short, medium and long-term transformational \nreforms. The implementation of the TA will start in September 2008, and may be continued until \nAugust 2010. The TA outcome will primarily be the actual implementation of a slice of the reform \nagenda over this period.

The \n2. \nfollowing  paragraphs  present  the  coverage  of  issues,  which  may  be  further  elaborated  and \nrefined prior to or during the implementation of the TA. \n \nStructural  Transformation  \u2013  Paving  way  for  Medium-term  Reforms:  As  outlined  in \n3. \nthe  main  text  of  the  RRP,  the  technical  work  on  structural  transformation  will  be  undertaken \nthrough an ongoing TA and a TA loan. The purpose of this component of the proposed TA is to \ncoordinate  the  formulation  of  structural  transformation  strategies,  help  the  Government  build \nconsensus amongst the relevant stakeholders, and to implement the strategy. Specifically, the \nTA  will  support  the  High  Level  Working  Group  and  help  maintain  reform  momentum  by \n(i) providing  policy  advice  during  deliberations  of  the  working  group,  (ii)  assisting  in  the \nformulation  of  reform  actions,  (iii)  facilitating  consensus  building  on  reform  measures, \n(iv) assisting in the roll out of the national structural transformation action plan, (v) assisting in \nthe design of sector-specific development programs, (vi) monitoring the implementation of these \nprograms,  and  (vii) providing  recommendations  on  relevant  issues  such  as  how  to  promote \nstructural  transformation,  streamlining  business  processes  and  structures  of  government \nagencies, and moving away from regulation to promoting innovation in the industries. \n \n4. \nImmediate/Short-term  Reforms \n(Investment  Climate):  This  TA  component  will  help  the  Government  in  formulating  and \nimplementing a range of short-term measures critical to attracting investments, in parallel with \nthe  longer-term  structural  transformation  agenda.  At  this  stage,  the  specific  areas  identified \ninclude: (i) streamlining of labor laws \u2013 under which labor experts will assist in scoping out the \n\nStructural  Transformation  \u2013 \n\nImplementing \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n95 \n\n \nlegal  amendments  initiated  by  the  Government  to  consolidate  the  disparate  labor  laws,  and \nprovide  recommendations  on  future  steps  that  can  be  supported  under  AETP;  this  is  in \ncontinuation  of  the  reform  agenda  initiated  with  ADB  support  under  the  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise  Development  Program;  (ii)  identifying  tax-related  distortions  that  prevent  the \nformation of business or further expansion of existing ones, and helping with the formulation of \nappropriate  incentives;  and  (iii)  improving  the  tariff  policy,  based  on  past  (and  updated) \nassessments  of  the  tariff  bands  and  dispersions,  and  recommending  measures  to  increase \nPakistan\u2019s competitiveness.   \n \nFinance/Corporate  Sector  Development:  The  support  under  the  TA  will  focus  on \n5. \ncarrying  forward  the  agenda  identified  and  initiated  as  part  of  subprogram  1  of  AETP  on \nbanking, non-banking and corporate sector (with focus on holding companies or groups) fronts. \nInternational/national expertise will be mobilized on a needs-basis in any of the areas included \nin subprograms 1-3 of the policy matrix. In addition, consultants will also support in the design of \nmeasures  for  promoting  long-term  financing  in  Pakistan,  specifically  through  pension  and \ninsurance sector reforms, which may be included in future subprograms. \n \nIII. \n \n6. \nIt is estimated that 5-6 international experts and 6 national experts will be required with \nexpertise in the areas identified in Table A13.2. Their outline terms of reference are presented in \nSection  IV  below.  However,  depending  on  the  emerging  circumstances,  the  CWRD  team \nimplementing the TA will retain flexibility on the number and person-month allocations between \nthe categories as well as their tasks. All experts will be recruited on an individual basis, given \nthe  disparate  nature  of  the  tasks  involved,  and  the  possible  need  to  recruit  and  deploy \nconsultants at different points in time subject to reform traction. Table A13.3 presents the cost \nestimates and financing plan for the TA. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Cost Estimates \n\nTable A13.2: Technical Assistance Requirements \n\n \n\nInternational \n\n10 \n\nNational \n20 \n\nAdvisory Needs for Design and Implementation of Reforms \n(Key Areas and Indicative Person-Months Requirements) \n\nKey Areas \n1.

MOF  will \nfacilitate the work under Components 1 and 2, and help the consultants in the coordination of \ntechnical work with any of the concerned departments/agencies. Work under Component 3 will \nbe directly under the supervision of the concerned financial sector regulators. \n \n\n10 \n\n2 \n8 \n\n \n10 \n5 \n5 \n\n30 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n96 \n \n8. \nAs  the  overall  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  facilitate  structural  transformation,  there  is  need \nfor:  (i)  increasing  awareness  amongst  government  officials  and  policy  makers;  (ii)  improving \ncoordination  between  the  federal  and  provincial  governments,  as  the  policy  and  institutional \njurisdiction  is  split  between  the  two  levels;  and  (iii)  improving  the  interface  between  investors \nand  corporates  on  the  one  hand  and  the  government  on  the  other.  The  TA  will  organize \nworkshops or special events/sessions targeted at selected industries. \n \n\nTable A13.3. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan for AETP TA \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

Changes \u2013 both in coverage and expertise \u2013 may be \nnecessary during implementation. \n \n10. \nStructural  Transformation:  This  component  will  be  partly  technical  and  design  of \nreform measures, but mostly implementation of the plan prepared as part of the ongoing studies \nbeing undertaken with the Government of Pakistan on structural transformation.  \n \n11.  Medium-term Transformation Agenda (broadly item 1.1 in Table A13.2): The ongoing \nTAs  are  likely  to  be  completed  by  about  March-April  2009.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s second  generation  poverty reduction strategy (PRSP II) is built around seven pillars: (i) drivers of \neconomic  growth  and  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  crafting  a  competitive  advantage,  (iii)  harnessing  potential  of  the \npeople,  (iv)  financial  sector  deepening  and  economic  development,  (v)  provision  of  world  class  infrastructure, \n(vi) effective  governance  and  management,  and  (vii)  targeting  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy \nand Program for Pakistan similarly supports the Government\u2019s emphasis toward higher sustained growth. \n \nThe recent trends in global and regional poverty as well as Pakistan\u2019s own experience from the last PRSP suggest that \nrapid economic growth over a prolonged period is essential for poverty reduction. At the macro level, economic growth \nimplies  greater  availability  of  public  resources  to  improve  the  quantity  and  quality  of  education,  health  and  other \nservices. At the micro level, economic growth creates employment opportunities, increases the income of people and \ntherefore, reduces poverty. The proposed Program will help Pakistan achieve and sustain higher economic growth in \nthe medium term through a process of structural transformation. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nBetween 2000/01 and 2004/05, Government estimates suggest a significant decline in the incidence of poverty in the \ncountry.1 The  proportion  of  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  fell  sharply  from  34.5%  in  2000/01  to  23.9%  in \n2004/05,2 with approximately 13 million people moving out of poverty. This happened at the back of Pakistan\u2019s strong \neconomic  growth  which  accelerated  from  3.1%  during  2001/02  to  4.7%  the  next  year,  and  onto  an  average  of  8.1% \nduring  2003/04  and  2004/05.  The  steep  decline  in  poverty  of  over  10  percentage  points  in  four  years  actually  more \nthan  offset  the  sharp  rise  in  poverty  during  1997-2001  when  overall  poverty  increased  by  8.7  percentage  points  as \nGDP  was  growing  only  by  a  modest  3.3%  per  annum  on  average.  Notwithstanding  this  development,  around  36.45 \nmillion people in Pakistan still live below the poverty line. Moreover, the incidence of poverty in 2004/05, using a longer \ntime horizon, was not much different than the level of poverty of 25.5% recorded in 1992/93. Poverty appears to have \ncome full circle in Pakistan. In the immediate to short-run, the challenge is to maintain the hard  won improvement in \npoverty levels and even improve upon it through sustained growth in the range of 6-8 percent per annum.  \n \nTo  sustain  high  rate  of  growth,  Pakistan  needs  to,  among  others,  address  immediate  distortions  in  the  economy, \nparticularly  in  the  agriculture  and  energy  sectors.  The  pricing  and  procurement  system  for  wheat  needs  to  be \nrestructured, and subsidies better targeted to benefit the poor and vulnerable. The poorly targeted subsidies cost the \nGovernment  PRs40  billion  ($600  million)  in  FY2008,  not  including  the  additional  resource  requirements  \u2013  estimated \nupwards of $1.6 billion at a minimum - to cushion the poor against the escalating prices. Pakistan also needs to fix its \nsubsidy system in the electricity sector. In the absence of an automatic adjustment mechanism, the Government has \nnot  been  able  to  settle  the  payments  owed  to  distribution  companies,  which  has  resulted  in  a  vicious  circular  debt \nproblem and debt overhang in the sector. This problem needs to be addressed urgently to resolve the present energy \ncrisis facing Pakistan. The immediate resource requirements are upwards of $2.5 billion.   \n \nHousehold expenditure surveys indicate the average share of food in total expenditures is inversely related to income \nlevels. A sharp rise in food price can have a devastating effect on the poor. In Pakistan, food prices have gone up by \nmore  than  20%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008.  ADB\u2019s  analysis3 shows  that  a  10%  increase  in  food  prices  can  throw  an \nadditional 7 million into poverty in Pakistan, a 20% increase 14.7 million and a 30% increase an additional 22 million. \nWhile energy prices have also gone up by about 30% in the first quarter, the rise in poverty incidence is estimated to \nbe  much  smaller  of  about  1.5  percentage  points.  ADB\u2019s  analysis  also  shows  that,  if  every  poor  person  were  to  be \ncompensated to offset the loss in real expenditure, the Government may incur between PRs18.5 billion (0.3% of GDP) \n\n                                                 \n1  The poverty line is based on a threshold of 2350 calories per adult equivalent per day, using the calorific approach for estimation. \n2  The latest Government estimates suggest that there has been a further decline in the incidence of poverty to 22.3% in 2005/06.  \n3  ADB.

Design Features \nThe  Program\u2019s  pro-poor  design  includes  measures  to  (i)  expand  the  social  safety  net  and  make  it  more  efficient  to \nprotect  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  the  adverse  impact  of  recent  global  developments,  and  (ii)  adopt  structural \nreforms to address inefficiencies in the agricultural sector, particularly with respect to wheat markets and food security \npolicies. (The poor and vulnerable are found to be affected most by a hike in wheat price.) Specific interventions are \ndiscussed in detail below. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) to the country and major groups affected. \n\n \nThe Program will provide significant benefits in general, and directed benefits for the poor in particular.  \n \n\n\u2022 \n\nFirst, it will help meet the immediate and massive fiscal needs of the Government. At a minimum, the agriculture \nand energy subsidies need to be met at a cost of upwards of $3 billion.  \n\n\u2022  Second, the Government needs to move away from the inefficient and untargeted subsidies to a targeted safety \nnet program for the poor. Beginning with about 2 million households, the Program will help target up to about 5 \nmillion households, or roughly about one-fourth of the poor who are likely to be directly affected by the spiraling \nfood inflation. \nThird, the Program will open the way for structural transformation. \nFourth,  the  Program  will  help  cut  the  transaction  costs  for  businesses  (reductions  in  red  tape  in  tax  payments) \nand improve investment climate.  \nFifth,  the  Program  will  raise  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  arising  from  development  of  a  financial \nsector  safety  net,  including  a  depositor  protection  scheme,  and  stronger  financial  intermediaries  that  are  better \nable to mobilize and allocate resources and risks, and promote financial sector stability. \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\nanalysis). \n\n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \n\n \nThe appropriate direction of food security policy in the short-term should safeguard food availability and accessibility of \nthe poor and vulnerable. For farmer producers, a guaranteed minimum price (but indexed on both costs of production \nand the export parity level) may be needed to enable farmers to reap some of the economic gains of wheat price hikes. \nAs part of Subprogram (SP) 1, the Government has increased the supply price of wheat for farmers by more than 50% \nor 80% of the export parity price in early 2008. This is a good step towards market-based pricing, but there has to be \nan  automatic  adjustment  process  put  in  place,  which  will  be  pursued  under  subsequent  subprograms.  As  part  of \nsubprogram  1,  the  Government  has  lowered  its  wheat  reserves  to  3  months  of  national  consumption  requirements. \nThis is an important step, as the Government has never been able to procure more than 20% in the past. The higher \ntarget, despite being unrealistic, has exerted artificial pressures on the markets.  \n \nSpecific policies are needed to deal with the root causes and consequences of high energy prices. Although the current \npolitical economy and global landscape pose complex policy challenges, the Government has taken certain key actions \nunder  subprogram  1.  These  include:  ensuring  up-to-date  payments  of  the  tariff  differential  subsidies  to  power \ndistribution companies (DISCOs), allocating sufficient resources for energy subsidies in the budget to meet the forecast \nneeds  over  FY2009,  and  determining  the  extent  of  circular  debt  and  debt  overhang  in  the  electricity  sector  and  ring-\nfencing the debt owed by DISCOs. The settlement of the past subsidies owed by the Government will cost $1.1 billion. \nAddressing the circular debt and debt overhang is likely to need another about $3-$3.5 billion over 2008-2010. \n \nAnother  achievement  of  subprogram  1  is  to  enhance  awareness  of  the  need  to  move  from  the  poorly  targeted  and \ninefficient  subsidies  in  the  food  and  energy  sectors  to  a  more  targeted  safety  net  system.  The  Government  has  set \naside  resources  in  the  FY2009  budget  to  provide  cash  transfers  and  food  support  for  about  5  million  poor  and \nvulnerable households in a targeted manner. Means-tested cash transfer programs have been developed. Ultimately, \nthe Government aims to expand the safety net cover over the next 2-3 years. \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n\n \nPoverty levels in Pakistan fluctuated a great deal during the last one and a half decade, with the fluctuation generally \nassociated  with  the  economic  growth  performance  of  the  country.  The  Program  aims  to  help  Pakistan  achieve  and \nsustain  higher  economic  growth  of  about  8%  on  average  per  year  from  2012-2020,  through  a  process  of  structural \ntransformation  of  the  country\u2019s  economy.  The  Program  will  provide  the  fiscal  and  implementation  support  needed  to \nundertake  and  leverage  reforms.  With  the  observed  macro  level  poverty-growth  correlation,  this  sustained  high \neconomic growth is expected to contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nThe  challenge  of  poverty  alleviation  still  remains  huge.  Pakistan,  being  a  signatory  to  the  Millennium  Development \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n101 \n\nGoals (MDGs), is committed to achieving the MDG target for poverty by halving the level of poverty incidence between \n1990 and 2015. The estimated level of poverty in 1990 in Pakistan was 26%. This needs to go down to 13% by 2015 if \nthe  target  is  to  be  met.  With  the  present  poverty  level  of  24%,  there  is  clearly  still  a  long  way  to  go.  The  poverty \nproblem,  therefore,  is  not  about  to  be  immediately  eliminated  and  will  require  sustained  efforts.  Continued  and \nconsistent pursuit of pro-poor growth policies, along with accompanying investments and a focus on the effectiveness \nof  investment  spending,  and  forging  long-term  and  constructive  partnerships  with  the  private  sector,  civil  society  and \ndevelopment institutions, will be key to ensuring the long term success of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \nand programs.    \n \nThe  proposed  Program  is  premised  on  three  key  principles.  First,  Pakistan  needs  to  address  certain  economic \ndistortions in the short-term, specifically by reorienting inefficient subsidies and targeting them to benefit the poor and \nvulnerable. Second, Pakistan needs to diversify its economy and increase the share of industry from the current level \nof 25% of GDP and particularly increase the share of high value added manufacturing. In parallel, it needs to increase \nagriculture  productivity and  make its service sector produce greater value. Third, Pakistan needs to deepen financial \nintermediation and increase financial sector stability and soundness. \n \nThere can be no presumption that structural transformation of an economy of the size and nature such as Pakistan\u2019s \ncan  happen  in  a  short-span  of  time,  or  through  rigidly  prescribed  conditionalities.  To  achieve  the  principles  laid  out \nabove,  the  Program  sets  out  a  4-5  year  design  and  implementation  period,  and  a  cluster  structure  that  provides \nflexibility to meet evolving circumstances. It sets out short and medium-term actions, with changes to come beyond the \n5-year period. The Program will only tackle the more tangible issues, with a large number of procedural and process \nrelated changes taking place in parallel to the proposed reform measures.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nAmong the most pressing crises facing the Government is the rising food prices, especially the main staple, wheat. A \nconfluence of global factors resulted to this phenomenon: high food demand and changing food consumption patterns, \nincreasing energy prices which encourage shift in production land use from food to alternative biofuel, increased land \ncultivation for feeds, and structural neglect for agriculture investments.  \n \nPakistan  experienced  a  20%  increase  in  wheat  prices  between  November  2007  and  February  2008.  In  November \n2007, the Federal Bureau of Statistics reported that food and beverage prices had risen by 14.7% from October 2006 \nto October 2007. The poorest segments of the population are particularly hard hit by the increases in food prices. Long \nqueues have formed at government stores and  wheat ration cards have been reinstituted. Violent protests have also \nerupted in the country. While high food prices hurt poor consumers, they are expected to help poor farmers: however, \nthis depends critically on whether farmers can get access to needed fertilizer, irrigation, and markets. \n \nHalf  of  Pakistan's  population  is  considered  to  be  \"food  insecure,\"  according  to  the  World  Food  Programme.  Food \nsecurity as defined in the World Food Summit (Rome 1996) is a situation \u201cwhen all people, at all times have physical \nand economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food and to meet their dietary needs and food preference of an \nactive  and  healthy  life.\u201d  Food  security  is  measured  in  terms  of  (i)  physical  access  to  food  (or  availability),  economic \naccess  to  food,  and  biological  utilization  of  food  (food  absorption).  Many  studies  note  that  in  Pakistan,  physical \navailability of food (including wheat flour) may not be the main issue, but rather consumers are constrained by poverty \nor their low income that in turn, impedes their ability to use the food adequately for a balanced proper nutrition.  \n \nPakistan  has  set  up  a  range  of  schemes  to  help  the  poor,  with  many  based  on  targeting.  The  Government  has  also \ndevoted  significant  efforts  to  expand  microfinance  outreach.  The  existing  schemes,  however,  suffer  from  four  key \nproblems:  weak  design  (including  poor  eligibility  criteria),  poor  implementation,  risk  of  elite  capture,  and  weak \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  Further,  the  scale  of  the  needs  and  challenges  facing  Pakistan  now  are  quite  significant, \ncalling for a robust safety net scheme that is based on strong data and criteria. \n \nThe Program will assist the Government in ensuring food availability and access of wheat flour especially for the poor \nand  vulnerable  groups.  Key  agenda  for  action  include:  (i)  establishing  a  more  cost-effective  and  market-oriented \nreserve  stock  management  system,  and  (ii)  developing  and  implementing  a  means-tested  cash  transfer  and  food \nsafety net program. \n \nIn  the  medium-term,  food  security  cannot  be  sustained  through  provision  of  consumer  and  producer  subsidies. \nMeasures that enhance economic activities and job creation  would be a more sustainable basis for the poor to cope \nwith food price spikes. Further, higher productivity of the food producing sector and its integration to a more efficient \nand  effective  integration  of  the  food  supply  chain  are  required  instead  of  distortionary  price  supports.  Specifically, \nfarmers  need  to  be  equipped  with  access  to  (i)  high  yielding  seed  varieties,  modern  technology  and  agronomic \npractices  and  secured  water  supply  and  land  use  rights;  as  well  as  (ii)  access  to  accurate  information  on  market \nconditions,  market  infrastructure,  and  institutional  arrangements  that  effectively  link  them  to  the  domestic  and  global \nmarket. With these, the farmers can make the right choices and to realize profits from evolving global trading system. \n\n \n\n\f102 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n \n\n1.
