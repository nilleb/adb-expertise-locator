Of the \n$500  million  for  subprogram  1,  $200  million  will  be  from  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) resources.    \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Economic management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance, inclusive social \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability, financial and \neconomic governance, other vulnerable groups  \n   \nEnvironment  Category C. No adverse environmental impact was identified. \nAssessment \n   \nProgram Rationale  Pakistan\u2019s economy has been seriously affected by the skyrocketing \ninternational prices of oil and food. The severity of the exogenous \nshocks,  aggravated  by  the  uncertainties  surrounding  the  recent \npolitical transition, has been felt on several fronts over the last fiscal \nyear (June 2007-July 2008): the year-on-year overall domestic inflation \nreaching 24% from 7%; deterioration in the external accounts with \ncurrent  account  deficit  widening  to  8.5%  of  GDP  from  4.8%; \ndepreciation of the Pakistani rupee (PRs) by 22%; foreign exchange \nreserves declining by more than 40% to $6 billion (about 1.5 months of \nimports); and unprecedented fuel, food and electricity subsidy needs, \nwhich rose four-fold to PRs408 billion ($6 billion) from their original \nbudgeted level. Symptomatic of the declining investor confidence, the \nKarachi stock index dropped by more than 35% during April-July 2008, \nand the spreads on sovereign debt have surpassed 1,100 basis points \nat end-August 2008 from less than 200 basis points in early 2007. The \noutcome of all this has been a decline in real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth to 5.8% from 7% during the previous year.  \n \nThese challenges facing Pakistan have come despite steady real GDP \ngrowth of 7.3% on average per year during FY2004-FY2007. But they \nhave also come in the context of, as well as due to, persistent fiscal, \ntrade and investment imbalances and lack of any significant structural \nchanges in the economy.  \n  \n ", "ii   \nPakistan now needs to transform itself in three directions: \n \nFirst, it has to address the immediate distortions facing the economy, \nparticularly  in  the  agriculture  and  energy  sectors.  The  pricing  and \nprocurement system for wheat needs to be restructured, and subsidies \nbetter targeted to benefit the poor and vulnerable. Untargeted wheat \nsubsidies cost the Government PRs40 billion ($600 million) in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2008. In the electricity sector, Pakistan doest not yet have an \nautomatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism.  The  Government  needs  to \nreform the subsidy system in the sector, since it has not been able to \nsettle  the  payments  owed  to  distribution  companies,  which  has \nresulted in a vicious circular debt problem and debt overhang. This \nneeds to be addressed urgently to resolve the present energy crisis. \nElectricity  subsidies  are  estimated  to  have  cost  PRs133  billion  in \nFY2008 ($2 billion). In addition to these subsidy needs, an estimated \n$1.6 billion is required to partially protect the poor.   \n \nSecond,  Pakistan  needs  to  strengthen  financial  intermediation  to \nfacilitate structural transformation. At the macro level, the Government \nhas relied heavily on the central bank for its fiscal requirements, a \npractice that needs to be reversed. In parallel, the legal and regulatory \nframework should be strengthened to manage risks more effectively in \nthe  financial  sector,  promote  consumer  confidence,  and  deepen \nfinancial intermediation.  \n \nThird, over the medium to long term, the production and trade structure \nof the economy needs to be transformed so Pakistan can compete \nmore effectively in the global economy. A deeper industrial base is \nvital, along with a more productive agricultural sector, greater value \ncreation in the service sector, and far greater export sophistication. To \nachieve this, the Government has to (i) address short-term policy and \ninstitutional distortions, (ii) identify industries where it might compete \non a global scale, and (iii) attract private sector investments. \n \nADB  has  worked  in  the  past  with  Pakistan  alongside  other \ndevelopment partners to support reforms and investments in all three \ndirections. The challenges now facing the country are diverse and \nsignificant that immediate assistance is needed to address the short \nterm constraints and to provide safety nets for the poor, while paving \nway for boosting Pakistan\u2019s competitiveness.  \n   \nGovernment\u2019s Policy  Immediate  priorities:  To  address  the  present  macroeconomic \nResponse and  challenges,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  four  point  stabilization \nStrategy  plan, working in tandem with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). It has \nalso sought technical advice from development partners, including the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  in \ndeveloping the plan, which focuses on: (i) ensuring price stability and \neffective  demand  management  through  interest  rate  adjustments; \n(ii) pass-through of subsidies while protecting the poor from economic \nshocks; (iii) shoring up foreign exchange reserves; and (iv) restoring \nfiscal discipline and reducing borrowing from SBP. \n ", "  iii\nMedium-term  agenda:  As  it  deals  with  the  short-term  challenges \nduring the current fiscal year (by June 2009), the Government also \nplans to launch medium-term structural reforms in two key directions. \nIncreasing infrastructure investments in power and transport is a key \npart of its strategy, besides adopting measures to deepen Pakistan\u2019s \nindustrial base and making its agriculture sector more productive. The \nGovernment plans to achieve this by rationalizing its own involvement \nin  key  economic  sectors,  and  by  attracting  greater  private  sector \nparticipation. The fiscal space generated will help ensure adequate \nsocial safety nets as well as adequate spending on health, education \nand other priorities. In parallel, Pakistan also has adopted a framework \nfor  a  medium-term  financial  sector  strategy  to  strengthen  financial \nintermediation and promote confidence. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The AETP will help Pakistan achieve and sustain higher economic \ngrowth in the medium term. The expected outcome of the AETP is \nstructural economic transformation through (i) removal of short-term \ndistortions in the agriculture and energy sectors; (ii) strengthening of \nfinancial intermediation; and (iii) development and implementation of a \nnational structural transformation strategy.  \n   \nSpecial Features  The AETP will help Pakistan address the challenges posed by the \nongoing food and energy crisis in a systematic manner. Subprogram 1 \nis also one of ADB\u2019s responses to the food crisis in the region, a \nresponse that was first announced by the President at the ADB Annual \nMeeting  in  May  2008  and  recently  set  forth  in  the  paper  ADB\u2019s \nResponse to the Food Crisis. \n   \nCoordination with  ADB has worked with other development partners on the short-term as \nDevelopment  well  as  the  medium-term  issues.  On  macroeconomic  stabilization \nPartners  measures, ADB has relied on advice from the IMF and the World Bank \nand exchanged views with other bilateral partners. Part of the short \nand medium-term agenda, as it relates to agriculture, infrastructure \nand finance sector issues, is well grounded in ongoing investment and \npolicy support by ADB and other partners. Regular dialogue has taken \nplace, including in finalizing the AETP actions, with the concerned \npartners.  The  structural  transformation  agenda  is  new  and  being \ndeveloped.  Several  institutions  support  investment  climate  and \ncompetitiveness reforms, with some specializing in selected sectors. \nOnce the principal studies under the AETP are completed by early \n2009, ADB will coordinate closely with all stakeholders in helping the \nGovernment chalk out the future reform directions. \n   \nPeriod and  The AETP will be structured as a program cluster with four single-\nTranching  tranche subprograms to be implemented approximately between June \n2007 and July 2011, comprising \n  \n(i)  subprogram 1 (covering reforms from June 2007 to September \n2008) - addressing the food and energy crisis, supporting short-\nterm  investment  climate  measures,  and  paving  the  way  for \nmedium-term structural transformation;  \n ", "iv   \n(ii)  subprogram 2 (October 2008 to June 2009) - further reforms for \nstructural transformation;  \n(iii)  subprogram 3 (July 2009 to June 2010) - expanding reforms to \nenhance private sector participation in key sectors; and \n(iv)  subprogram 4 (July 2010 to June 2011) - completion of the \ninitial phase of structural transformation.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The proposed loans for subprogram 1 are as follows:  \n \n(i)  A loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwill  be  provided  under  the  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.  \n(ii)  A loan of $200 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources will  be  provided,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \na term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. \n \nThe  subprogram  1  loans  totaling  $500  million  equivalent  will  be \navailable  following  satisfaction  of  subprogram  1  policy  actions  and \nafter loan effectiveness. \n \nTo retain the reform momentum and predictability of financing, the \nGovernment  has  requested  that  subprogram  2  of  the  AETP  be \nprocessed during September 2008\u2013June 2009, for possible approval \nbefore the end of June 2009 in the amount of $500 million. Subject to \nreform progress and financing requirements, subprograms 3 and 4 \ncould each be in the range of $400 million to $500 million, with the \nentire program cluster\u2019s aggregate amount in the range of $1.8 billion \nto $2 billion. The scope and amounts for each subprogram will be \nfinalized  during  the  review  and  processing  of  the  respective \nsubprograms. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated from \nthe  proceeds  of  the  OCR  loan  shall  be  used  first,  to  support  the \nadjustment costs of reforms to be initiated and implemented under \nsubprogram  1,  and  second,  to  finance  expenditures  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s general development purposes. The Government shall \nensure that the local currency generated from the proceeds of the ADF \nloan shall be used to support the poor and vulnerable households \nunder the two targeted social safety net programs set forth in output 1 \nof subprogram 1. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the \nAETP. \n ", "  v\nImplementation  MOF  will  coordinate  with  the  concerned  ministries  on  the  AETP \nArrangements  content, and will help ensure that the reform agenda stays on course. \nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will handle the implementation of \nactions under subprogram 1 and future subprograms relating to the \nfinancial sector, in coordination with MOF. The Government will ensure \nthat other regulatory agencies or ministries are consulted as required. \nADB  will  closely  monitor  program  implementation  to  ensure  that \nenvisaged outputs and outcomes are achieved. \n   \nProcurement and  Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \nDisbursement   countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of ineligible \nitems and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and \nrelated  requirements  for  program  loans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed \nagainst  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  Government \nstipulating that the value of the total imports of Pakistan, minus its \nimports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is equal to or \ngreater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a \nparticular  year.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The AETP will not only help stabilize the macroeconomic situation but \nand Beneficiaries  also benefit target groups affected by fuel and food inflation. It will help: \n \n(i)  Meet the large and immediate fiscal needs.  \n(ii)  The Government transition from the current system of inefficient \nand untargeted subsidies toward a targeted safety net program for \nthe poor. Beginning with about 2 million households immediately, \nand expanding to cover 5 million households during the 2008-\n2009  fiscal  year  if  the  safety  net  program  implementation  is \nsmooth,  the  AETP  could  potentially  target  up  to  9  million \nhouseholds. \n(iii)  It will raise public confidence in the banking system through a \ndepositor protection scheme, and stronger financial intermediaries \nthat are better able to mobilize and allocate resources and risks. \n(iv)  It will open the way for structural transformation. \n(v)  It will cut transaction costs for businesses by reducing red tape \nand improving the investment climate. \n(vi)  Overall, the AETP framework will enable ADB to sustain policy \ndialogue on structural reform in sectors where ADB has been \nactively involved through past and current investments. \n   \nRisks and  While some of the risks of the AETP are political and outside its scope, its \nAssumptions  design will mitigate a range of others, including the following:  \n \n(i)  Interest group resistance. This is likely, as those affected by \nreforms in the short-term may resist. The Government is adopting \na good communication strategy to articulate the long-term and \ncountry stability interests that are behind the reforms. Further, the \n ", "vi   \nprogram cluster nature of the AETP ensures prior actions by the \nGovernment before financing is provided.   \n(ii)  Weak capacity. This is a generic concern, which is elevated in \ncase of complex reforms. Adequate design and implementation \nsupport  is  being  mobilized  under  AETP  through  technical \nassistance. The agenda under the AETP is also largely home-\ngrown. \n(iii)  Global food and fuel crisis. The measures under AETP are \npredicated on there being a global recovery. Although global price \ntrends  will  be  a  major  determinant,  AETP  measures  will \nrationalize subsidies and target them better to cushion Pakistan \nagainst some exogenous shocks. \n(iv)  Lack of policy coordination. The AETP will demonstrate the \nclear  benefits  of  product  diversification,  industrialization, \nprocessing  and  value  creation  and  will  therefore  help  build \nconsensus.  ADB\u2019s  current  analytical  and  design  work  on \ntransformation is supported by well-known institutions, which will \nbring credibility to the reforms and help build momentum.  \n \nAt the same time, the risks associated with not supporting Pakistan\u2019s \nsafety net programs and the longer-term economic transformation agenda \nare also high. In the absence of timely reforms, the Government\u2019s budget \nwill continually be burdened by costly and inefficient subsidies, leaving \nfewer resources for development financing. The financial sector will be \nvulnerable to systemic risks and investors will be vulnerable to market \nfraud  and  misconduct.  Without  meaningful  structural  transformation, \ngrowth may once again be stalled and macroeconomic stability disrupted, \nbringing  the  country  back  to  the  previous  cyclical  pattern.  High  and \npersistent  macroeconomic  imbalances  will  constrain  investments  and \neconomic growth, and aggravate poverty. \n \nThe underlying assumptions for the AETP include   \n(i)  strong and sustained leadership and commitment to reforms,  \n(ii)  development partner coordination, and \n(iii)  open dialogue with the private sector and other key stakeholders. \n   \nTechnical  AETP embeds a TA to help implement the AETP and to design the \nAssistance  reform agenda for subprograms 2\u20134. It will also help monitor subprogram \n1 implementation and provide the Government with timely policy advice \nas  requested.  In  particular,  the  TA  will  support  implementation  of  a \nnational  structural  transformation  agenda,  and  advisory  work  on  the \nfinancial  sector.  It  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,040,000.  ADB  will  provide \n$800,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and the \nGovernment will contribute $240,000 equivalent. In parallel, resources \nfrom an existing TA (Support for Governance Reform) financed by the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom will be \nused to support the effective management of budget resources in the \nAETP context. In addition, an ongoing subproject under the same TA will \nsupport Pakistan\u2019s anti-money laundering efforts. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Accelerating  Economic \nTransformation Program1 (AETP) comprising four subprograms; and (ii) two proposed loans for \nthe first subprogram of AETP (subprogram 1). The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) to support the AETP and, if the Board approves the proposed program cluster \nand loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Current Challenges Facing Pakistan \n2.  Recent  Past:  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  increased  its  resilience  over  a  five  year  period \npreceding  mid-2007,  despite  gradually  rising  oil  prices  and  the  devastating  earthquake  in \nOctober 2005. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated from 3.1% during fiscal \nyear (FY) 2002 (July 2001-June 2002) to 9% in FY2005, before leveling off at 6.8% in FY2007. \nEconomic growth had just begun to be driven more by investment than by consumption.  \n \n3.  Current  Challenges:  In  contrast  to  the  picture  over  the  last  few  years,  the \nmacroeconomic situation sharply deteriorated during FY2008 and July-August 2008, due largely \nto  exogenous  oil  and  food  price  shocks,  the  tumultuous  political  transition  and  security \nconcerns. Aggravated by long-standing structural inefficiencies in the agriculture, industry and \nenergy sectors, the economy slowed down to 5.8% in FY2008. Overall inflation went above 24% \nyear-on-year in July 2008, from just above 7% a year earlier. Fiscal and current account deficits \nshot up. The Pakistani rupee (PRs) depreciated by 22% since July 2007, with almost half of that \ndecline taking place in July-August 2008. State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) gross international \nreserves declined from $14.3 billion at the beginning of FY2008 to $8.6 billion at end-June 2008, \nand  further  to  $6  billion  or  1.5  months  of  imports.  The  political  events  and  economic \nuncertainties, compounded by the value erosion in international financial markets, led to a steep \ndecline in investor sentiments. The Karachi stock index, a top performer in the region, dropped \nby more than 35% during April-July 2008. Standard and Poor\u2019s downgraded Pakistan\u2019s debt \nrating from B+ to B in May 2008 followed by Moody\u2019s. In parallel, the sovereign spreads on \nPakistani bonds rose from about 400 basis points in July 2007 to over 1,100 basis points at end-\nAugust 2008.  \n \n4.  Macroeconomic Imbalances: Leading to the adverse outturns, Pakistan has built up \nsignificant macroeconomic imbalances, with a rise in fiscal and current account deficits, and an \nexpanding savings\u2013investment gap. The fiscal deficit rose to 7.4% of GDP in FY2008 from 4.3% \nin  FY2007,  due  to  lower  revenue  growth  and  rising  expenditures  brought  about  by \nunprecedented food and fuel price hikes and by the concomitant increase in subsidies. The \ncurrent account deficit in FY2008 increased to 8.4% of GDP compared with 4.8% of GDP in \nFY2007, due to worsening conditions in all three accounts\u2014trade, services, and income. The \nimport  bill  increased  considerably  because  of  rising  international  commodity  prices  and \novershadowed  the  15.9%  increase  growth  in  exports  in  the  fiscal  year.  Textile  exports \n(accounting for almost 60% of Pakistan\u2019s exports) recorded a very low growth of 3.8% in \nFY2008. Pakistan also faced a large current account deficit in FY2007 that was financed by \nlarge capital inflows. In FY2008, however, portfolio investment declined by 98.9% while foreign \ndirect  investment  growth  stagnated,  largely  as  a  result  of  political  events.  The  growth  in \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2   \nremittances, while strong at 17.4% (reaching over $11 billion) has not been sufficient to offset \nthe decline in other components of the capital account. \n \n5.  Fiscal Constraints: In the short term, the large fiscal imbalances lie at the heart of \nPakistan\u2019s unstable macroeconomic situation. The current deficit level breaches the 4% ceiling \nmandated under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2005. The Government may have no option but \nto continue to run a revenue deficit, even if it is committed under that act to eliminate the deficit \nby FY2008. The fiscal situation, if not addressed, will have a profound and costly impact on \noverall  macroeconomic  stability  and  growth  prospects.  There  are  four  key  facets.  First, \ncommodity price hikes pushed up the subsidies for oil, electricity, wheat, and fertilizer. For \nFY2008, actual subsidies amounted to PRs407.5 billion ($6.0 billion), almost four times higher \nthan the original budgeted amount of PRs114 billion ($1.7 billion). Second, interest payments, \nparticularly on domestic debt, has been growing and will almost double over FY2009\u2013FY2011 to \nPRs430 billion ($6.3 billion) over the level in FY2005 (PRs230 billion). Third, revenue growth \nhas not accelerated. Pakistan\u2019s revenue to GDP ratio continues to be amongst the lowest in the \nregion, at around 10% of GDP. Fourth, development expenditures, which more than doubled \nsince FY2003 to 5% of GDP in FY2007, need to be maintained at a fiscally sustainable level. \nElection-related promises pushed up budgeted spending to PRs520 billion in FY2008, although \nthe actual spending amounted only to PRs423 billion due to low absorptive capacity. In recent \nmonths, the new Government has allowed a steady (but insufficient) rise in domestic oil prices, \nadjusted the electricity tariff, cut down the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP), and \nfrozen  supplementary  grants  to  departments.  However,  these  measures  have  not  been \nsufficient  to  contain  the  situation,  and  the  fiscal  deficit  needs  to  be  financed.

Poverty incidence was 25.5% in the early 1990s, \nbefore rising to 34.5% in FY2001, and declining to 23.9% in FY2005 and 22.3% in FY2006, \naccording  to  government  estimates. 3  Other  studies  have  estimated  it  at  29.3%\u201336.4% \n(44 million\u201345 million people).4 Meanwhile, the latest Government estimates point to a further \nreduction in the poverty rate to 22.3% in 2005/06. Household expenditure surveys indicate that \nthe share of food in total expenditures is inversely related to income levels, which means that a \nsharp rise in food price can have a devastating effect on the poor. Food expenditures make up \nan average of about 60% of household expenditures of the poor in Pakistan. Food prices \nincreased by more than 20% in the first quarter of 2008, and by 32% year-on-year as of June \n2008. ADB\u2019s analysis5 shows that a 10% increase in food prices could drive an additional 7 \nmillion into poverty in Pakistan; a 20% increase, 14.7 million; and a 30% increase, 22 million.6 \nAfter food, the second major household expenditure is energy, the price of which increased by \nabout 30% in the first quarter of 2008. The rise in poverty incidence from such an increase in \nenergy prices is estimated to be much smaller at about 1.5 percentage points. ADB\u2019s analysis \nalso  shows  that,  if  every  poor  person  were  to  be  compensated  to  offset  the  loss  in  real \n                                                 \n3  Based on a Government-set threshold of 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day, which is the official poverty \nline. \n4  World Bank. 2007.

A recent assessment shows that the application of the Government\u2019s monetized poverty line of PRs878.6 per \nperson results in a larger incidence ratio of 36.4%. Under this method, rural poverty incidence is 45.7% and urban \npoverty is 22.1%. Chaudhry, A.A., and T.T. Chaudhry. 2008. The Effects of Rising Food and Fuel Costs on Poverty \nin Pakistan.

A 20% increase in food prices can increase rural \npoverty by as much as 8\u20139 percentage points and urban poverty by 5 percentage points.  \n ", "4   \nexpenditure caused by food and energy price increases, the Government may incur an annual \ncost of between PRs18.5 billion (0.3% of GDP) and PRs83 billion (1.3% of GDP).7 \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s Policy Response to the Challenges \n7.  The Government has adopted a four point plan to deal with the macroeconomic and \nsocial impact of the exogenous shocks, as laid out in Box 1.  \nBox 1: Pakistan\u2019s Policy Response to the Current Macroeconomic Challenges \nThe Government of Pakistan and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have worked in tandem over the \nlast few months to adopt and implement a four-point plan focused on: \n(cid:57)  Dealing with inflation: SBP has raised its discount rate by 350 basis points over the last fiscal \nyear; cash reserve and statutory liquidity requirements were increased by 100 basis points in \nMay  2008.  Besides  strengthening  demand  management,  this  measure  will  also  bring \ncommercial banks into the Government debt market. In parallel, the Government has been \ncoordinating with provincial counterparts to reduce administrative barriers on mobility of goods. \n(cid:57)  Passing-through the subsidies, while protecting the poor from economic shocks: The \nGovernment has reiterated its commitment to achieving the 4.7% fiscal deficit target. Domestic \nfuel prices are being adjusted on a fortnightly basis, with domestic prices of gasoline and high \noctane fuel at 1.7 times that of import prices. Subsidies on kerosene and light diesel oil are \nbeing brought down. The Government plans to increase power tariffs by 62% in the coming \nmonths, with the first increase of 31% to be made effective from early September 2008. In \nparallel, the Government has allocated PRs41 billion ($600 million) in the budget for fiscal year \n2009 for social safety nets, which will provide support for up to 5 million households from the \nadverse economic shocks. The Government plans to expand the safety net cover over the next \nthree years. \n(cid:57)  Shoring up foreign exchange reserves: The Government and SBP have taken three main \nsteps. First, they are negotiating a deferred oil payment facility with friendly oil exporting \ncountries, which could result in deferring about $5 billion per year. Second, an aggressive \nprivatization program will be pursued. Third, they have imposed a range of administrative \nmeasures to conserve foreign exchange have been introduced, including a 50% limit on \nadvance payment for imports, a margin requirement of 35% for opening letters of credit for \nnon-essential imports, and a stipulation requiring prior SBP consent for outward remittances of \nmore than $50,000. \n(cid:57)  Restoring fiscal discipline and reducing borrowing from SBP: The Government aims to \naddress the level of recurrent and development spending. It has also set a target of keeping \nthe net borrowing from SBP to zero on a quarterly basis. The Government is also launching \nshort-term debt instruments to reduce the reliance on SBP borrowing. \n8.  Federal Budget 2008/09: The federal budget for 2008/09 aims to reach the lower fiscal \ndeficit of 4.7% of GDP through fiscal consolidation involving rationalization of public expenditure \nand achieving strong growth in revenues. On the expenditure side, the total allocation for \nsubsidies including those for power, oil, food, and fertilizer, at PRs295 billion is 28% less than \nthe actual subsidy level in FY2008. To curtail inefficient and untargeted recurrent spending, the \nGovernment announced in the budget to eliminate oil subsidies by December 2008 and the \ndifferential power subsidy by the end of the fiscal year or earlier. In addition, a freeze on non-\nsalary  spending  was  imposed  in  government  departments  to  curtail  current  expenditure.  \nHowever, the PSDP for 2008/09 at PRs550 billion was proposed to be 22% higher than the \nrevised PSDP for 2007/08. But this too has been reportedly cut by more than PRs100 billion in \n                                                 \n7  Supplementary Appendix B contains an analysis of poverty in Pakistan. \n ", "  5\nAugust 2008. On the revenue side, the tax revenue of PRs1.3 trillion for 2008/09 is 24% higher \nthan the actual tax receipts last year. Two major revenue mobilization measures included in the \nbudget included increasing the maximum rate of import duty to 35% and sales tax increased \nfrom 15% to 16%. With a view to cut down imports as the trade and current account deficits \ncontinued to climb and foreign exchange reserves precipitously fell in July and August 2008, the \nGovernment announced additional custom duties of 15 to 50% on the import of about 350 luxury \nitems and consumer goods. The steps announced by the Government in the budget to stabilize \nthe economy and reduce the fiscal and current account deficits have to be implemented in full to \nreinforce sustainable growth.  \n9.  To protect the poor from the impact of high commodity inflation caused by soaring \ninternational prices and reduction in subsidies, the Government in the budget also instituted \nseveral relief measures. These included: raising minimum wages for unskilled workers; granting \n20 percent increase in the basic pay and pensions of all government employees; setting up of \nthe Benazir Income Support Program with initial allocations of PRs34 billion and cash grants of \nPRs1,000 to identified poorest households; establishing a national employment scheme to \ncreate self employment opportunities; and a Peoples Work Program to create employment \nopportunities and build small scale infrastructure with an allocation of PRs28.4 billion. \n \n10.  Medium-Term Context. Clearly, the present challenges facing the country are not all \nshort-term. The lack of adequate structural reforms is among the primary reasons for the \npersistent and frequent episodes of fiscal and current account deficits, in turn constraining \ninvestments and economic growth, and aggravating poverty. The current challenges, if left \nunattended, will stall growth again and disrupt macroeconomic stability. Youth unemployment is \nalready over 10%. Job creation is vital, in an environment of political and security uncertainties. \nIn the longer run, Pakistan needs to widen and deepen the industrial and export base, increase \nproductivity,  and  expand  private  sector  involvement.  ADB\u2019s  latest  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram Update for Pakistan (2006\u20132008)8 supports the Government\u2019s emphasis on higher \nsustained  growth.  The  proposed  AETP  will  help  initiate  the  structural  changes  needed  to \nachieve and sustain higher growth levels through a process of economic transformation. \n   \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Why Does Pakistan Need a Structural Transformation of its Economy? \n11.  The shares of key economic sectors in total output have been stagnant in Pakistan for \nmany decades. Agriculture accounts for 21% of GDP now, declining from 26% two decades \nago. The share of industry declined in 1990s by two percentage points to 23.3% by the end of \nthe decade, before gradually increasing to 26% at present, while that of services has increased \nfrom 49% in 1990 to just above 53% now. Figure 1 presents the changes in sectoral shares \nsince 1990. More recently, overall real GDP growth slowed in FY2008 largely due to the poor \nperformance of agriculture and manufacturing. Within services, trade, transport and finance \nhave registered strong growth. Particularly, extensive structural reforms in the financial sector \nsince the early 1990s have unleashed extraordinary growth. The share of the financial sector is \n6.5% at present. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update for Pakistan (2006\u20132008).

Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2008. Manila \n \n \n12.  Despite robust economic growth until last year\u2019s slow-down, Pakistan has continued to \nhave fiscal, trade, and investment imbalances.9 Successful economies in Asia such as Malaysia \nand Thailand have considerably strengthened their macroeconomic fundamentals over the last \n2-3 decades, by undertaking significant structural transformations which in turn have led to high \ngrowth rates with favorable macroeconomic balances. These countries changed their output \nand employment structures dramatically, transferred resources to sectors with higher value-\nadded and diversified production. Firms within these countries have learned to produce and \nexport a more sophisticated and technologically advanced range of products, and their labor \nproductivity  has  increased  significantly.  Pakistan  needs  a  structural  transformation  of  its \neconomy, as described in Appendix 3. It needs to grow more quickly and to sustain higher \ngrowth, to provide more jobs, and to increase the welfare of its growing population. It needs to \nspecialize in niche areas, and not to be trapped in areas where it no longer has a comparative \nadvantage. \n \n13.  Need to Sustain Growth.  Pakistan registered an average annual growth rate of 5.5% \nduring 1960\u20132007. However, because of its relatively high population growth, between the mid-\n1980s and the early 2000s the per capita growth rate declined markedly (Figure 1 in Appendix \n3). Since 2001, however, this trend has reversed and policy makers hope to maintain this \nperformance in the medium term. \n \n14.  Need to Deepen the Industrial Base. To achieve sustained growth, Pakistan needs to \ndeepen its industrial base, as well as to improve its performance in agriculture and services. \nWhile the share of the manufacturing sector in total output is not low (nearly 20%), it has \nremained stagnant since the 1970s (Figure 3 in Appendix 3). The share of manufacturing value-\nadded accounted for by high-technology products is low and has remained so during the last \n                                                 \n9  Private investment increased to 16.2% of GDP in FY2007 from 15.4%, in FY2005 supported by improving business \nconfidence and an increase in public investment. Private savings increased between FY2005 and FY2007 but, \ngiven continued strong consumption, this was not enough to finance the expanded private investment. This pushed \nthe private savings\u2013investment gap to 3.4% of GDP in FY2007 from 2.9% in FY2006. \n ", "  7\n40 years. Pakistan\u2019s exports per capita are low (Figure 5 in Appendix 3), and it continues to \ncompete with exports from even poorer countries (e.g., rice, cotton yarn, undergarments, cotton \nbed linen, and other woven fabrics). Labor productivity has increased very slowly since the \n1970s with an annual growth rate of only 2.6%. Unless the production and trade structure of the \neconomy is transformed to enable it to compete effectively in global markets, Pakistan's 6%\u20137% \nreal GDP growth per annum is unsustainable.  \n \n15.  In summary, Pakistan needs (i) a deeper industrial base, (ii) a more productive and \nefficient agricultural sector, (iii) greater value creation in the service sector, and (iv) far greater \nexport  sophistication.  To  achieve  this,  Pakistan  needs  to  address  the  current  structural \ndistortions, among others, in energy and agriculture sectors immediately, develop a stronger \nfinancial sector, and identify niche areas and sectors where the country can compete effectively \nand accelerate value creation. \n \nB.  Issues, Growth and Reform Challenges, and Opportunities \n1.  Immediate Distortions in Key Sectors that Perpetuate Macroeconomic \nImbalances, Slow Growth and Impede Structural Transformation  \n \n16.  Untargeted  Subsidies.  As  a  result  of  long-standing  sector  inefficiencies  and  the \nchallenges described below, Pakistan now has huge subsidy needs to cover increases in the \nprice of oil, power, wheat, and fertilizer. The unprecedented increase in the price of oil resulted \nin a subsidy of PRs175 billion\u2014far above the PRs15 billion provided for in the budget. The \npower subsidy arising from the tariff differential and other elements rose to PRs133.3 billion\u2014\nagainst the PRs72 billion subsidy in the budget. The subsidy on imported wheat and wheat \nsupplied at concessional rates through the Utility Stores Corporation was in the range of PRs40 \nbillion\u2014no provision had been made for this in the budget. The fertilizer subsidy was PRs29.5 \nbillion\u2014against the budgeted amount of PRs13.5 billion. Figure 2 shows the major components \nof subsidies for FY2008 which amounted to PRs407.5 billion in total, almost four times higher \nthan the budgeted amount of PRs114 billion.  \n \nFigure 2: Budgeted vs. Actual Subsidies for 2007/08 \n(PRs Billion)\n200\n175.0\n150 133.3\n100\n72.5\n50 40.0\n29.5\n15.0 13.5\n0\nBudgeted Subsidies Actual Subsidies\nOil Power Fertilizer Wheat\n \nSources:  Government of Pakistan, Finance Division 2007.

The National Social Protection Strategy, which aims to bring social \nsafety nets to 6.1 million households in 2012 was approved in 2007.10 Before this, there was no \noverarching social protection strategy in Pakistan and a lack of direction and poor coordination \non the part of individual agencies and programs. Pakistan has set up a range of schemes to \nhelp the poor, with many based on targeting (Appendix 4). Income support is offered through \ntwo cash transfer programs, Zakat and Bait-ul-Mal. However, the existing schemes suffer from \nfour key problems: weak design (including poor eligibility criteria), poor implementation, risk of \nelite capture, and insufficient monitoring and evaluation. Further, the significant needs and \nchallenges facing Pakistan require a robust safety net scheme that is based on strong data and \ncriteria. The Government is working to improve targeting, delivery mechanisms, and monitoring \nthrough  a  number  of  initiatives.  Beneficiary  databases  are  being  cleaned  up  and  a \ncomprehensive computerized management information system based on computerized national \nidentity  cards  is  being  created.  Developing,  piloting,  and  expanding  proxy  means-tested \ntargeting mechanisms in combination with community validation is expected to enhance the \ntransparency  and  credibility  of  the  system.  Fiduciary  risks  are  being  minimized  through \nimproved financial management and the introduction of consolidated accounts at the field level \nto ensure effective reconciliation.    \n \n18.  Distortions in the Agriculture Sector.11 One of the most pressing concerns facing the \nGovernment in the short term is the adverse impact on the poor and the vulnerable of the \ncontinued  rise  in  food  prices,  especially  wheat,  the  main  food  staple.  While  Pakistan  has \ngenerally been self-sufficient in wheat, the Government puts a high priority on ensuring food \nsecurity and on guaranteeing adequate and affordable wheat and wheat product.12 To attain \nfood security, the Government has adopted a dual price policy that protects the interests of the \nwheat farmers on one hand, and the wheat product consumers on the other. It assures wheat \nproducers of a support price13 that covers their costs of production. It also provides consumers, \nmost  of  whom  live  in  the  cities,  with  affordable  prices  by  enabling  flour  mills  access  to \nsubsidized wheat and assured quota allocations.14 The Government also helps to stabilize the \nprice of wheat and wheat products by maintaining a fair market share of total wheat production, \nwhich averaged 27% for 2000\u20132007,15 for strategic reserves (for emergency purposes and to \nmeet the wheat requirements of the poor and vulnerable) and operational reserves (to stabilize \nthe price of wheat and wheat products). This market share is maintained through domestic \n                                                 \n10 Government of Pakistan. 2007. National Social Protection Strategy. Islamabad. \n11 Appendix 5 outlines the key production, pricing, procurement and distribution issues related to wheat in Pakistan. \n12 Wheat products, particularly wheat flour (atta) and bread (roti), are a major part of the diet, providing about 60% of \nprotein and carbohydrate requirements. Households spend a substantial portion of their incomes on food. Wheat \nproducts represent 15.9% of household expenditure. Wheat is Pakistan\u2019s largest food grain crop, with 80% of \nfarmers cultivating wheat and about 40% of cultivable area being devoted to wheat production. Wheat provided \n38% of total crop value added in FY2007. \n13 The guaranteed minimum price or the support price accorded to wheat farmers by Government is the estimated \nprice of wheat that would be sufficient to cover the costs of production. The support price is announced by the \nGovernment in September or October, the starting time for wheat sowing. The support price is fixed and effective \nfor the whole country during the wheat cultivation period. The provincial food departments and directorates buy \nwheat from farmers at designated procurement centers, especially in harvest season months when the wheat \nmarket price decreases to the support price. The provincial government stabilizes the price of wheat by releasing \nthis wheat during lean season months. \n14 The subsidized wheat price for flour mills is called the issue price. In theory, it is equivalent to the support price for \nfarmers plus the incidental costs of transporting and storing the wheat. In fact, the issue price is on average about \n10% lower than the actual price. This is equivalent to a subsidy from the provincial governments which absorb \nmost of the incidental costs and part of the support price.   \n15 The provincial government stabilizes the price of wheat by releasing the procured wheat especially during lean \nseason months. Provincial food departments and directorates procure a certain volume every year to enable them \nto stabilize prices. The publicly announced procurement quota was 4 million\u20135 million tons; actual procurement \naveraged 3.5 million tons. \n ", "  9\nprocurement, imports if there is a foreseen shortfall in production, and exports if there is a \nsurplus.     \n \n19.  To support the regulated prices and procurement activities at farms and flour mills, the \nGovernment administers the trading and marketing of wheat reserves as well as imports and \nexports through its Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Supplies Corporation (PASSCO), the \nTrading Corporation of Pakistan, and the provincial food departments and directorates. These \nregulatory measures are supported by state-owned storage facilities, procurement centers, and \nutility retail stores, as well as by easy access to credit from the SBP and commercial banks. The \nGovernment subsidy for wheat price stabilization purposes at the federal and provincial levels is \nsubstantial. The wheat subsidy on imported wheat products and those supplied at concessional \nrates through the Utility Stores Corporation was in the range of PRs40 billion (2.6% of the \nbudget) for FY2008, although no provision had been made for this in the budget.  \n \n20.  Under  the  ADB-funded  Agriculture  Sector  Program  Loan  Phase  II16 (ASPL  II),  the \nGovernment agreed to remove the pervasive public sector interventions in the wheat market, \nwhich created disincentives for wheat producers, millers, and traders to develop an integrated \nfood industry. Initiatives included the removal of market restrictions in trade, elimination of \nconsumer  subsidies  and  producer  support  subsidies,  the  divestiture  and  restructuring  of \nPASSCO and provincial food departments, the closure of food directorates, and streamlined \nwheat reserve management. Because of the politically sensitive nature of the wheat policy and \nthe volatile sociopolitical situation in the first half of the current decade, a phased market-based \nwheat policy that would lay the groundwork for a market-oriented wheat industry was deemed \nthe most politically feasible approach. At the end of ASPL II in mid-2007, the government had \nreduced the gap between the support and issue prices and international prices, completed the \nrestructuring  plans  for  PASSCO  and  food  departments  and  directorates,  enabled  freer \nmovement  of  wheat  domestically  and  internationally,  and  drawn  a  distinction  between \noperational and strategic reserves.  \n \n21.  The  second  half  of  2007  was  a  litmus  test  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nsustaining the phased market reforms in wheat. Because of the profit incentives that can be \ngained from the higher market prices for wheat and wheat products, the Government, despite its \nefforts to defend the public-determined prices of wheat and wheat products and its use of \ncoercion to restrict trade and achieve its procurement targets, was powerless to stop prices from \nincreasing.  Consequently,  the  poor  and  vulnerable  bore  the  brunt  of  high  prices  and \ninaccessible food as the Government\u2019s food security strategy did not put in place an effective \ntargeted safety net measure.  There are renewed interests in Government, civil society and \nsome parts of the private sector in reverting to a greater public role in the wheat sector to \nensure food security. It is essential that the investments in phased market reforms under ASPL \nII be ensured by accelerating the implementation of reform measures. Key policy measures that \nneed to be brought to their logical conclusion include (i) the elimination of the consumer subsidy \nfor wheat by moving to a market-based sale price, (ii) the elimination of the producer subsidy by \nmoving from a support price to a market-based price for the procurement of wheat, (iii) efficient \nreserve management based on strategic reserves, (iv) an end to restrictions on domestic and \ninternational wheat trade, and (v) streamlining the roles of PASSCO and food departments and \ndirectorates in strategic reserve management. These need to be complemented by policies to \nprovide targeted safety net measures for the poor and vulnerable groups and the promotion of \nnew financial instruments and institutional arrangements to integrate farms with consumers. \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agriculture Sector Program II. Manila. \n ", "10  \n22.  In the medium term, the lynchpin of sustainable food security is high economic growth \nbased on economic activities that create jobs in agro-industries with high value-added and in the \nmanufacturing and service sectors. Assured and rising incomes would be a more sustainable \nway for the poor to cope with food price spikes and to move out of poverty permanently. This \nwould form the foundation for transforming subsistence agriculture into commercial and pro-\npoor agriculture, which would in turn finance the development of value-adding manufacturing \nand service sectors.  \n  \n23.  Challenges in the Energy Sector. Pakistan\u2019s energy sector is in deficit, both in energy \nand in financial terms. Although the country's energy resources are diverse (comprising power, \noil, gas, coal, nuclear and renewable energy), energy insecurity and a power crisis persist. The \nsector remains institutionally fragmented and there is a lack of integrated energy planning to \naddress the country\u2019s short, medium- and long-term energy needs. There is insufficient power \ngeneration to meet rising demands and the demand\u2013supply imbalance reached 5000 MW in \nJune 2008.17 Critical investments in the generation and distribution systems have not kept pace \nwith economic growth so available electricity is not effectively dispersed to end consumers. The \ntransmission system is no longer a bottleneck, but the system margins and expansion program \nneed to be effectively implemented to prevent network instability and constraints. The global oil \nprice hike and general fiscal shortcomings have created a circular debt18 problem in the energy \nsector,  stopping  power  generation  companies  from  reaching  optimal  production  levels. \nPakistan\u2019s sustained economic growth will be seriously affected if these twin deficits are not \naddressed urgently.19  \n \n24.  Pakistan does not have an automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism. Regulatory \ntariffs have not kept up with the rising cost of operating, maintaining, and expanding the system, \nparticularly in an environment of rising fuel costs given Pakistan\u2019s large thermal generation \ncapacity which runs mainly on fuel oil. There continues to be a discrepancy between the tariff \ndetermined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority and the tariff notified by the \nGovernment. Because of fiscal constraints, the Government has not been able to disburse \ntimely  power  subsidies  (which  cover  the  difference  between  the  National  Electric  Power \nRegulatory Authority\u2019s determined tariff and the tariff notified by the Government), thereby \ndepleting  the  sector  of  liquidity  and  cash  flow.  As  a  result,  power  distribution  companies \n(DISCOs) have not paid off their liabilities fully for their electricity purchases, causing a working \ncapital shortfall for the power generation companies. As a result, they cannot pay their oil and \ngas suppliers for fuel purchases. This spill-over has severely affected the entire energy supply \nchain and the inter-corporate circular debt is estimated to be close to PRs60 billion, causing an \nacute liquidity crisis and a deterioration of fuel stock levels at all links in the value chain. \n \n25.  A power tariff freeze from 2003 to 2007 in the wake of rising fuel prices and late payment \nof subsidies by the Government meant that by the end of FY2007 the DISCOs owed the Central \nPower Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited \n(NTDC) almost PRs220 billion. It is estimated that the debt had reached about PRs240 billion by \n30 June 2008, in accordance with the Annual Financial Statements of the DISCOs and NTDC. \n \n                                                 \n17 Pakistan faces a current demand of about 15,140 MW (peak-hour demand). This will rise to about 28,000 MW by \n2015, 41,000 MW by 2020, and 60,500 MW by 2025 and a huge 84,800 MW by 2030. \n18 Circular debt is accumulated debt among a series of entities from, for example, the customer through the power \ndistribution company all the way to the fuel supplier of the power generation station. The root cause has been \nnonpayment by the Government and its entities. \n19 Appendix 6 presents the key energy sector issues facing Pakistan. \n ", " 11\n26.  Since 1992, Pakistan has been contemplating a restructuring of the power sector. The \nobjectives of these reforms are yet to be fully achieved: (i) private investment has been attracted \ninto the generation subsector, particularly in the mid-1990s, but it has declined in recent years \n(Karachi Electric Supply Company Limited\u2019s privatization has not yielded expected technical and \nfinancial efficiency results and the ex-Water and Power Development Authority DISCOs are yet \nto be privatized), (ii) the quality of service to the end user has been compromised significantly \nby power shortages (leading to riots during peak demand summer months) and by overloading \nof the transmission and distribution networks, and (iii) instead of being a net contributor to the \nnational treasury, the power sector has become a fiscal burden to the tune of $2 billion a year. \nThe successful implementation of reforms will be even more important as the Government \nseeks to attract large private sector participation in developing and funding the current and \nfuture power generation and system requirements. The reform agenda clearly has some way to \ngo.  The  immediate  needs  include  corporate  autonomy  and  sector  governance,  electricity \ntrading, and financial management.  \n \n27.  The fiscal imbalances afflicting the power sector need to be addressed immediately and \ncomprehensively. It is essential to determine the actual amount of the debt, to isolate it, and to \ndevelop a realistic debt restructuring plan that is acceptable to all stakeholders. It is expected \nthat any debt restructuring plan would need to span several years. In parallel, the DISCOs \nshould be allowed to charge cost recovery rates and the generation companies must have real \nand timely cost adjustments for their tariffs. The capacity and distribution bottlenecks need to be \naggressively tackled. The Government is keen to address the short-term generation crisis, and \nto ensure sufficient funding for NTDC and the DISCOs so they can improve their transmission \nand distribution systems. Strategic decisions for long-term hydroelectricity generation have to be \ntaken today. \n \n2.  Limited Financial Intermediation \n \n28.  Progress.  Structural  transformation  is  dependent  upon  an  effective  and  efficient \nfinancial sector. The Government is committed to reforming this sector to enable it to become \nmore competitive and a more inclusive part of the Pakistan economy. Recent bold reforms to \ndevelop the banking sector have resulted in substantial deregulation, the transformation of the \nbanking sector from a predominantly state-owned system into a healthier market-based system \nprimarily owned by the private sector, and the emergence of SBP as a more responsive and \nindependent regulator. Locally incorporated private banks now control 74% of banking assets, \nas compared with 4% in 1992. Total banking assets (less funds held in SBP) represent 56.1% of \nGDP, as compared with 66.8% in India, for example. \n \n29.  Challenges to Prudential Regulation. In line with emerging best international practices, \nSBP continues to review the legal and regulatory framework for the banking sector to ensure \nthat it enables growth and increases the depth of this sector without compromising stability. \nWhile SBP continues to systematically update its prudential regulations, it faces ongoing and \nemerging challenges, many of which arise from implementation of the Second Basel Accord on \ncapital adequacy (Basel II). Many banks need to improve their risk management.  \n \n30.  Financial  Sector  Consolidation.  The  emergence  of  financial  conglomerates  has \nbecome a feature of the financial sector in Pakistan and globally. A major features of banking \nsector reform in Pakistan has been the consolidation of the banking sector in order to establish \nfewer but stronger banks. There have been 22 bank mergers and 7 bank acquisitions since \n2000, most of which have involved mergers between commercial and investment banks. Groups \nof affiliated financial sector entities that include a bank (hereinafter \u201cfinancial conglomerates\u201d) \n ", "12  \nare  becoming  the  norm,  as  banks  broaden  their  product  offerings  and  seek  cross-selling \nopportunities. In addition to interests in investment banks, a number of banks also own shares \nin insurance companies and have interests in asset management companies and mutual funds. \nSome banks own shares in local banks and microfinance banks, and many may be involved in \nother  nonbank  financial  activities  such  as  leasing,  advisory,  and  brokerage  services, \nmodaraba20 management, and foreign exchange. \n \n31.  While the emergence of financial conglomerates is commercially attractive, it raises a \nrange of issues for the regulation of the financial sector. The main risks introduced by financial \nconglomerates relate to conflicts of interest and potential contagion. Risks have become more \ndifficult to monitor because financial conglomerates operate across several segments of the \nfinancial system. In the absence of proper consolidated supervision, a financial conglomerate or \nany of its subsidiaries or affiliates may become vulnerable to double counting of capital, large \nintra- and extra-group exposures, contagion problems among entities within the conglomerate, \nand conflicts of interest between business units within the conglomerate. There is also a risk \nthat losses from banks will be transferred to less regulated and supervised nonbank financial \nsector  affiliates  to  avoid  scrutiny.    Financial  sector  supervisors  need  to  improve  their \nunderstanding of the businesses of financial conglomerates as well as the means of accessing \ninformation and taking regulatory actions. \n \n32.  Regulatory Fragmentation and Arbitrage. Pakistan\u2019s existing regulatory architecture \nhas  an  awkward  separation  of  powers  between  SBP  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission of Pakistan (SECP). SBP supervises and regulates banks, development finance \ninstitutions, microfinance banks, and exchange companies, whereas SECP regulates nonbank \nfinance companies (NBFCs).21   \n \n33.  Under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, banks are deposit-taking institutions \nthat can perform all the functions performed by NBFCs, including investment banking, leasing, \nhousing  finance,  and  asset  management.  Banks  can  also  perform  NBFC  functions  by \nestablishing separate subsidiaries, which would, however, be regulated by the SECP.  \n \n34.  Due to the nascent state of the local capital market, a number of NBFCs are engaged in \ndeposit-taking, which is traditionally regulated by banking regulators to address prudential risk \nconcerns.  For  example,  while  investment  banks  traditionally  perform  corporate  advisory \nservices  such  underwriting  and  other  capital-market-related  activities,  they  have  gradually \nventured into deposit-taking and lending. They mobilize short-term funds from the general public \nand extend working capital and overdraft facilities to businesses. Since they are specifically \nprohibited from undertaking commercial banking business, they get around this restriction by \nissuing withdrawal slips that work like checkbooks. A recent scandal involving one of the largest \ninvestment banks led the SECP to issue a directive to this bank to cease taking deposits\u2014the \ninvestment bank was unable to meet its obligations to depositors and institutional lenders. The \ndeteriorating profitability of other investment banks has led them to merge into more solvent \ncommercial banks. \n \n35.  NBFCs  were  previously  supervised  by  SBP.  However,  because  all  NBFCs  were \nincorporated as companies under the Companies Ordinance, 1984, only the SECP had the \n                                                 \n20 Modaraba is a contract in which one party provides capital to another party for the purpose of carrying on a \nbusiness with the stipulation that the profit will be shared by the participating parties in the clearly specified and \ndefined proportions agreed upon beforehand. Any loss incurred is to be borne exclusively by the capital owner. \n21 NBFCs  include  investment  finance  services  (investment  banking),  leasing,  housing  finance,  venture  capital \ninvestment, discounting services, and investment advisory and asset management services. \n ", " 13\npower to take action against them. Thus, when off-site surveillance and on-site inspection of \nNBFCs by SBP highlighted irregularities, SBP had to ask SECP to take action against them \nunder the Companies Ordinance. In December 2002, regulatory supervision of NBFCs was \ntransferred from SBP to SECP through an amendment to the Companies Ordinance. At the time \nof the transfer, existing and largely single-product NBFCs serving specific market niches were \nallowed to offer a range of financial products. However, there was limited consolidation of NBFC \nactivities, while banks began to make rapid inroads into this area. As a result, the market share \nof investment banks, leasing companies, and housing finance companies declined considerably. \nAt the time of their transfer from SBP to SECP there were 16 investment banks, compared with \n8 at present, which hold less than 1% of total financial sector assets. In addition, in a recent \ncase where an investment bank was found to have engaged in serious malpractice and fraud, \nthere was public confusion about SBP\u2019s oversight role since investment banks use the word \n\u201cbank\u201d in their name. This confusion has threatened the reputation of the banking industry and \nof SBP as its regulator. \n \n36.  Preventing Money Laundering. Safeguarding the financial sector from being used to \nlaunder the proceeds of criminal activities is a key priority for the Government.22 It aims to \ndevelop and implement legal and institutional measures that will meet international standards to \ncombat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, notably the Financial Action Task \nForce  on  Money  Laundering\u2019s  (FATF)  recommendations  on  anti-money  laundering  and \ncombating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT),  usually  described  as  the  FATF  40+9 \nRecommendations.23 \n \n37.  To this end, Pakistan has embarked on a range of efforts, including becoming a member \nof the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, a regional body associated with the FATF \ntasked with promoting implementation of the FATF 40+9 Recommendations in Asia and the \nPacific, and committed to implementing international standards for AML/CFT. At the national \nlevel,  Pakistan  adopted  an  Anti-Money  Laundering  Ordinance  in  September  2007.  The \nordinance  provides  the  legal  framework  for  AML  activities,  including  recognizing  money \nlaundering as a criminal offense and establishing a Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) in SBP to \nreceive and process reports of suspicious activities. While the adoption of the ordinance is a \nsignificant milestone toward greater transparency, further improvements are needed. First, the \nAnti-Money Laundering Ordinance provides for a cumbersome supervisory structure consisting \nof a national executive committee and a general committee. The national executive committee \nincludes relevant ministers, the SECP chairman, the SBP governor, and the director general of \nthe  FMU.  The  general  committee  includes  principal  civil  servants  from  the  ministries \nrepresented at the national executive committee, the SECP chairman, the SBP governor, and \nthe director general of the FMU. While the general committee is intended to provide assistance \nto  the  national  executive  committee  in  carrying  out  its  functions  under  the  Anti-Money \nLaundering  Ordinance,  it  is  unclear  how  this  is  supposed  work  in  practice.  One  national \ncommittee to develop policies and strategies for AML/CFT would be a better structure. The Anti-\nMoney  Laundering  Ordinance  also  envisages  that  the  director  general  of  the  FMU  be \nsupervised and controlled by the general committee. This is inconsistent with international \nstandards and best practices as the FMU should have financial and operational autonomy. \n                                                 \n22 Under principle 18 of the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (2006) (Basel Core Principles), \n\u201csupervisors must be satisfied that banks have adequate policies and processes in place, including strict \u2018know-\nyour-customer\u2019 rules, that promote high ethical and professional standards in the financial sector and prevent the \nbank from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, for criminal activities.\u201d  \n23 The FATF sets standards for global AML/CFT efforts. The FATF 40+9 Recommendations also encapsulate \nrelevant international law instruments such as United Nations conventions and United Nations Security Council \nresolutions.  \n ", "14  \n38.  Strengthening Payment Systems. A well-functioning payment system is the backbone \nof any economy. SBP has begun implementing key payment and settlement systems reforms. \nHowever, although Pakistan has made progress in the development of electronic payments, the \nexisting retail payment system is still largely based on checks or cash. At the retail level, banks \nhave focused on automatic teller machines and limited internet banking. SBP would like to \naccelerate efforts in this area to take maximum advantage of these new technologies, unify \nefforts to prevent a proliferation of incompatible systems, and develop an overall and longer-\nterm strategy for this area.  \n \n39.  Strengthening  Consumer  and  Depositor  Protection.  Pakistan  has  witnessed  an \nunprecedented  growth  in  consumer  banking,  which  has  led  to  a  manifold  increase  in  the \ngrievances of consumers against bank\u2019s products and services. As such, better consumer \nprotection is needed. An effective deposit protection scheme is also needed to ensure that \ndepositors have continued access to their fund. This will help maintain public confidence in the \nbanking system in the event of individual bank failures. The scheme will also protect the SBP \nand the Government from pressures to bail out all depositors in banks.  \n \n3.  Overall Growth and Competitiveness Concerns \n \n40.  Need for Long-Term Growth. As noted above (paras. 11-15), Pakistan faces major \nchallenges in a globalizing world (Appendix 3). Its contribution to global trade in high-value \ncommodities is negligible. The experience of the newly-industrialized economies in Asia shows \nthat robust growth needs to be sustained for at least 2\u20133 decades to have a significant and \nlong-term  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  With  increasing  links  between  more  sophisticated \nmarkets across the region and the world, the Government needs to set some clear targets for \nitself, and to develop the right policies and institutions. While there have been many studies and \nsome very good measures have been put in place by the Government, it needs to establish a \nclear corporate and business development plan to achieve structural transformation.   \n \n41.  Incentives  for  Investments. The Government has implemented reforms to simplify \ncross-border trade and reduce tax rates to stimulate investment. Nevertheless, the payment of \ntaxes and duties remains an impediment to doing business in Pakistan. Businesses need to \nspend about 2 months a year (560 hours) to comply with tax regulations.24 Tax administration \nremains hampered by unduly bureaucratic processes with excessive scope for discretion and \nrent-seeking by individual staff, lack of adequate systems of financial and physical control, weak \nhuman resources, and an absence of inspection controls in customs. Discretionary powers need \nto  be  reduced  and  tax  assessment  and  collection  procedures  that  do  not  involve  contact \nbetween  taxpayers  and  tax  officials  introduced.  This  calls  for  better  use  of  information \ntechnology and risk-based audit systems to reduce processing time, increase administrative \nefficiency and transparency, and raise levels of compliance. \n \n42.  Labor Legislation. Most surveys of business conditions in Pakistan indicate a major \nconcern with the labor legislation. Businesses in Pakistan need to comply with from 72 to over \n100 laws covering such issues as employment, working conditions, payment of wages and \nindustrial  relations.  The  resulting  complex  web  of  legislation  and  institutions  increases \ncompliance costs and decreases both employers\u2019 compliance with the laws and the employees\u2019 \neffective protection from employers\u2019 abuse. \n \n                                                 \n24 See World Bank. 2007.

ADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n44.  Link Between the AETP and ADB\u2019s Past and Planned Interventions. ADB has been \ninvolved in all the areas covered in the AETP. It has provided extensive support through \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  as  well  as  through  loans  for:  agriculture  (sector  reforms  and \ninvestments  focused  on  rural  development  and  irrigation);  power  (largely  investments  in \ngeneration,  transmission  and  distribution);  financial  sector  reforms;  and  trade  and  export \ncompetitiveness.  Appendix  7  lists  all  ADB-supported  projects,  programs  and  TAs  in  areas \nrelated to the AETP agenda during 1995\u20132008. Table 3 shows the links between the AETP \nagenda and ADB\u2019s past and planned interventions. \n \nTable 3:  Links between the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program  \nand Past and Planned ADB Interventions \nKey Areas  Past Interventions  AETP  Planned Interventions  \n(1995\u20132007)  (2008\u20132011)  (2008\u20132011) \nAgriculture  \u2022 Reforms  \u2022  Reducing distortions in  \u2022 Irrigation \n\u2022 Agri-business  the short-term  \u2022 Rural infrastructure (farm-\ndevelopment  (subsidies; state  to-market roads) \nprocurement)  \u2022 Market infrastructure \n\u2022  Targeted safety net \nElectricity  \u2022 Sector restructuring  \u2022  Reducing subsidies and  \u2022 Investing in transmission \n\u2022 Transmission  debt overhang  and distribution \nFinance  \u2022 Access  \u2022  Strengthening  \u2022 Expanding access and \n\u2022 Regulatory reforms  supervision  outreach \n\u2022  Improving access \nStructural  \u2022 Trade  \u2022  Economic diversification  \u2022 Full implementation \nTransformation  \u2022 SMEs \nLogistics  \u2022 Roads  \u2022  Business plan for NTC  \u2022 NTC implementation \nADB = Asian Development Bank; AETP = Accelerating Economic Transformation Program; NTC = National Trade Corridor; SME = \nsmall and medium enterprise \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff \n \n45.  While past ADB programs have supported reforms, there is no substantive overlap \nbetween past actions and those envisaged under the AETP. The AETP builds upon earlier \nreform initiatives by reinforcing critical reform measures (e.g., reductions in wheat subsidies or \npower sector debt restructuring). In the financial sector, a recent ADB program25 supported the \nSECP and the consolidation of supervision of NBFCs. The AETP will build on this and will help \nPakistan adopt a framework for consolidated supervision. \n \n46.  Lessons Learned. ADB\u2019s experience demonstrates that, although political disruptions \nmay  delay  program  implementation  in  difficult  macroeconomic  circumstances,  strong \nGovernment commitment and solid support from implementing agencies can prevent a program \nfrom becoming derailed and enable it to be successfully completed. ADB\u2019s extensive and in-\ndepth discussions with Government officials on the program design at the time of its formulation \nhas helped to ensure strong Government ownership of previous program reforms. Similar efforts \nwill be made in processing future programs. \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2007.

At the implementation stage, the capacity of market participants and regulators will be \ncritical in keeping reforms moving. Market participants should have market discipline and a good \nunderstanding of market operations and the virtues of regulation. Market supervisors should \nhave the capability to evaluate the operations of market operators, establish appropriate rules, \nand ensure that market participants operate in a prudential manner. It is particularly important \nthat capacity building and human resources development keep pace with policy reforms. \n \n48.  A program will yield better results if there is clear and close coordination among the \ngovernment agencies involved. These agencies should collaborate on a long-term basis to \nensure the sustainability and continuity of the development of a program. For example, while the \nSecond  Generation  Capital  Market  Reform  Program  identified  the  problem  of  fragmented \noversight over NBFCs, it did not focus on the role of SBP in addressing systemic risk concerns. \nOne of the key lessons from this program was the need to look at the entire financial sector in \naddressing regulatory and supervisory gaps, regulatory fragmentation, and arbitrage concerns \nto  enable  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  longer  term  framework.  The  legislative \nframework for the financial sector needs to be amended so it can address ongoing financial \nsector consolidation and reduce systemic risks more effectively. \n \n49.  The private sector needs to be involved in any reform program, since businesses are \nnormally the major beneficiaries of such reforms. Their involvement will help to create leverage \nfor proposed policy actions as well as to promote ADB\u2019s presence in the sector. \n \n50.  A monitoring and evaluation system and institutional mechanism must be in place to \nassess the progress of the policy reforms against indicators; to provide feedback on the impact \nof  the  reforms  on  macroeconomic  stability,  the  competitiveness  of  economic  sectors  and \npotential investment areas, and reducing the insecurity of the poor and vulnerable groups; and \nto guide structural transformation leading to sustained industrialization. \n \nD.  External Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n51.  A  number  of  other  development  partners  have  supported  macroeconomic,  sectoral, \ncompetitiveness, and investment climate reforms in Pakistan (Appendix 8). In preparing the \nAETP, ADB has sought advice from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank \non macroeconomic stabilization measures. To help meet the financing needs, the World Bank is \nworking on a combination of investment and policy reform support operations to be delivered in \nthe  coming  months.  Other  bilateral  partners  are  supporting  industrial  sector  and \ncompetitiveness issues. The sector agenda in AETP has benefited from ADB\u2019s past work in the \nrelevant sectors as well as ongoing dialogue with the concerned development partners with \ninvestment or policy reform engagement. \n  \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n52.  The proposed AETP will help Pakistan achieve and sustain average annual economic \ngrowth of about 8% from 2010 to 2020, through a process of structural transformation of the \ncountry\u2019s economy. The AETP will provide the fiscal and implementation support needed to \nenable the Government to undertake and leverage reforms. The expected outputs of the AETP \nare:  (i)  the  removal  of  existing  distortions,  thereby  initiating  structural  transformation; \n(ii) strengthening  of  financial  intermediation  to  support  structural  transformation;  and \n(iii) development and implementation of a national structural transformation strategy. \n ", "18  \n53.  The proposed AETP is structured as a cluster of four subprograms over 2008\u20132011. \nSubprogram 1 attends to the urgent task of addressing the fiscal implications of the current food \nand energy crisis and short-term investment climate problems. It will initiate reforms that will be \ncarried forward in the medium term. Subprograms 2\u20134 will build on these fiscal consolidation \nreforms and on analytical work and stakeholder consultation. These subprograms will support \nthe  Government  to  implement  policies  targeted  at  economic  diversification  and  structural \ntransformation. By addressing costly and inefficient subsidies in the energy and agriculture \nsectors,  the  AETP  will  provide  fiscal  space  for  the  Government  so  it  can  finance  overall \ndevelopment efforts. By helping to raise confidence in the banking system through a stronger \nregulatory environment, the AETP will mobilize financial resources and help to develop strong \nfinancial institutions that can channel investments to their most productive uses. In tandem with \na new industrial policy to diversify and deepen the industrial and export base, these efforts are \nexpected  to  initiate  an  economic  transformation  that  will  enable  Pakistan  to  sustain  high \neconomic growth. \n \n54.  The key constraints identified in the problem tree (Figure 3) are translated into three \noutput areas under the AETP (Figure 4, page 19). The AETP envisages immediate reforms to \nremove pricing, procurement, or other finance-related distortions (e.g., debt) in certain key \nsubsectors such as wheat and electricity. Reforms are also needed in the financial sector to \nboost public and investor confidence. In parallel, Pakistan needs to initiate the process of \nstructural transformation of its economy. \n \n55.  Table 4 (page 20) presents a snapshot of the principal program achievements along with \nresults indicators for key items under each subprogram. Appendix 9 presents the Government\u2019s \nLetter of Development Policy, accompanied by the policy matrix for the AETP in Appendix 10, \nlaying  out  the  policy  actions  for  subprogram  1  and  indicative  outputs  and  activities  for \nsubprograms 2 and 3. The activities for subprograms 2 and 3 will continue to be refined over the \nnext 1\u20132 years, while the agenda for subprogram 4 (for processing in 2011) will be formulated \nlater subject to satisfactory implementation progress. The indicators will be updated periodically, \ndepending  on  implementation  progress.  Appendix  11  presents  the  IMF\u2019s  macroeconomic \nassessment prepared at the request of ADB for the AETP.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n1.  Remove Immediate Distortions in the Food and Energy Sectors and Protect \nthe Poor and Vulnerable through Targeted Safety Net Programs \n56.  Protect the Poor and Vulnerable. Subprogram 1 will enhance awareness of the need \nto move from the current poorly targeted and inefficient subsidies in the food and energy sectors \nto a more targeted safety net system. The Government has set aside resources in the FY2009 \nbudget  to  provide  targeted  cash  transfers  and  food  support  for  about  5  million  poor  and \nvulnerable households. The targeted population will be reached by existing and new programs. \nClear  criteria  has  been  developed  for  selecting  beneficiaries  under  the  new  cash  transfer \nprogram. The application of the targeted safety nets for the poor and vulnerable households is \nin line with the reduction and eventual elimination of wheat subsidies, as set forth in the action \nplan of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC).26 The Government will evaluate the \n                                                 \n26 The ECC of the federal cabinet includes the ministers for commerce; communications; finance; food, agriculture \nand livestock; industries; information technology; petroleum and natural resources; ports and shipping; privatization \nand investment; railways; science and technology; textile industry; and water and power. It also includes, by \nspecial invitation, the special assistant to the prime minister on finance and revenue, the Planning Commission \ndeputy chairman, the SBP governor, and the chairman of the SECP, among others.

Adopt  Market-based  Wheat  Pricing  and  Introduce  an  Efficient  Wheat  Reserve \nManagement System. Subprogram 1 aims to complete the establishment of market-based \nwheat pricing and a more efficient and transparent wheat stock reserve management system \nbefore June 2010. A more holistic approach is needed that takes into account the food security \nconsiderations facing the Government. As part of subprogram 1, the ECC has adopted a time-\nbound policy action plan for ensuring a market-based wheat pricing regime and an efficient and \ntransparent reserve management system. The increase in the supply price of wheat for farmers \nfrom PRs425 per 40 kilograms to PRs650 in early 2008 was an important demonstration of the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to implementing the action plan. This was an important step toward \nmarket-based pricing, but an automatic adjustment process needs to be put in place to increase \nthe  support  price  to  80%  of  the  import  price  parity  level  and  this  will  be  pursued  under \nsubprogram 2. On procurement, as part of subprogram 2, the Government will lower its target \nfor wheat reserves to an estimated 3 months of the national annual average consumption \nrequirement. This is an important step, as the Government has never been able to procure more \nthan 20% of wheat production in the past. The previous target, despite being unrealistic, exerted \nartificial pressures on the markets. The remaining elements of the market-based wheat policy \naction plan will be implemented in subprograms 2 and 3, leading in the third year to market-\nbased pricing of the supply price of wheat and the pricing of wheat products; completion of the \nrestructuring of PASSCO and the food departments and directorates, streamlining management \nof the strategic reserves; freer movement of wheat domestically; and greater engagement of the \nprivate sector in the provision of key marketing infrastructure and services. Para.56 provides the \nmeasures that will lead to more efficient, transparent and accountable safety nets for the poor \nand vulnerable groups, including measures that address their food insecurity. \n \n58.  Take  Measures  to  Address  the  Energy  Crisis.  Specific  policies  to  curtail  sector \ninefficiencies are needed to address root causes and consequences of high energy prices. \nAlthough the current global and national economic outlook poses complex policy challenges, the \nGovernment has already taken key actions under subprogram 1. These include: initiating work \non determining the extent of circular debt and debt overhang in the power sector, ensuring up-\nto-date  and  timely  payments  of  the  tariff  differential  subsidies  to  DISCOs,  and  allocating \nsufficient resources for energy subsidies in the budget to meet the forecast needs over FY2009. \nIn  addition,  Parliamentary  approval  was  obtained  to  reduce  electricity  subsidies  through: \n(i) elimination of generalized sales tax subsidies for all domestic consumers and up to 500 units \nfor commercial consumers; (ii) introduction of automatic monthly fuel price adjustments through \na surcharge; and (iii) introduction of an additional surcharge to be levied on all consumers to \nreduce the gap between determined and notified tariffs. The settlement of the past subsidies \nowed by the Government will cost $1.9 billion. Addressing the circular debt and debt overhang \nis likely to need another $3.0 billion\u2013$3.5 billion over 2008\u20132010. \n \n2.  Strengthen Financial Intermediation \n59.  Improve Regulation and Supervision. Under subprogram 1, SBP has prepared a new \ndraft  of  the  Banking  Companies  Ordinance  to  incorporate  Basel  Core  Principles.  Draft \namendments include procedures for resolving difficulties faced by troubled banks, new powers \nto  enable  SBP  to  address  technological  changes  and  enforce  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework more effectively, new criteria to establish or liquidate a bank, and other measures to \nstrengthen bank governance. As part of the implementation of Basel II, SBP has increased the \nminimum capital requirements for banks from PRs2 billion at end-2005 to PRs4 billion by end-\n2007, PRs5 billion by end-2008, and PRs6 billion by end-2009 and adopted standardized and \ninternationally  accepted  approaches  to  credit,  market,  and  operational  risks.  Subsequent \nsubprograms will help the Government to fully implement Basel II. Also under subprogram 1, \n ", "22 \nSBP has launched work on a financial sector strategy focused on banks, including reforms to \nthe overall financial sector regulatory architecture. This strategy will be implemented over 10 \nyears  and  key  milestones  will  be  identified  when  policy  actions  for  subprograms  2\u20134  are \nfinalized. \n \n60.  Adopt a Framework for Consolidated Supervision of Financial Conglomerates. \nBasel Core Principles provide principles for regulating financial conglomerates. Principle 24 \nrequires that the banking supervisor have (i) the authority and capacity to evaluate all risks to \nthe  group;  (ii)  legal  authority  to  review  all  group  members;  (iii)  authority  to  set  prudential \nstandards for the group and to limit the group\u2019s activities; and (iv) access to all the group \ninformation that it requires to meet its responsibilities. In line with these principles, subprogram 1 \nwill  support  cabinet  approval  of  draft  legislation  to  establish  a  regime  for  consolidated \nsupervision of financial conglomerates. The draft legislation provides that SBP will be the lead \nregulator over all financial groups that include a bank and that it will have appropriate powers to \n(i) license the bank and/or holding company at the top of the group, and (ii) set out and enforce \nprudential standards for the group through the licensing requirements for the bank or the holding \ncompany. The draft legislation also provides SBP with greater regulatory oversight powers over \nparties who control banks and banking groups, and gives it the power to license, regulate, and \nsupervise  all  deposit-taking  institutions.  Subsequent  subprograms  will  support  legislative \nchanges  and  implementation  of  the  new  framework  for  consolidated  supervision,  including \nstrengthening of regulatory capacity, and developing a strategy and related implementation plan \nfor  moving  to  a  more  functional  approach  to  regulation  to  address  the  risk  of  regulatory \nfragmentation and arbitrage. \n \n61.  Strengthen  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Regime.  In  line  with  international  best \npractices,  subprogram  1  supports  cabinet  approval  of  amendments  to  the  Anti-Money \nLaundering Ordinance to strengthen the independence of the FMU. The amendments would \nreplace  the  two  committees  that  currently  exercise  oversight  over  FMU  with  one  national \ncommittee to develop national policies and strategies, enabling FMU, the financial regulators \nand law enforcement agencies to concentrate on operational matters. The FMU would serve as \nthe secretariat to this national committee. The amendments would also include transparent \ncriteria for the appointment and dismissal of the director general of the FMU. To strengthen \ncapacity in the fight against money laundering, the AETP will support the adoption of a national \ntraining program by the national committee for financial regulators, financial institutions, the \nFMU and law enforcement agencies. Subprograms 2 and 3 will implement the policy measures \nadopted under subprogram 1. \n \n62.  There is a current ADB TA for $1.5 million that will provide substantial capacity building \nand training, including the establishment and early operations of the FMU.28 This TA provides \nabout 32 person-months of international consultant inputs and 30 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs as well as support for workshops and other training activities. The TA will \ncontribute substantially to the efforts of the authorities and the work envisaged for the AETP.  \n \n63.  Enhance  SBP  Autonomy  and  Governance.  Subprogram 1 will help to develop a \nproposal for a new State Bank of Pakistan Act that will grant greater independence to SBP and \n                                                 \n28 \u201cStrengthening  the  anti-money  laundering  regime  in  Pakistan\u201d,  a  subproject  under  ADB.  2007.

This law is \nexpected to be enacted within the AETP implementation period. \n \n64.  Strengthen Payment Systems. SBP has established a new real-time gross settlement \n(RTGS)  system  for  wholesale  transactions.  This  is  a  milestone  in  strengthening  payment \nsystems in Pakistan. In addition, SBP has also introduced a centralized online system for retail \npayments. Subsequent subprograms may review and update this system, including possible \nplatforms for electronic and cell-phone-based transactions and addressing issues of privacy and \nsecurity. \n \n65.  Strengthen Consumer Protection for Depositors and Borrowers. As part of efforts \nunder subprogram 1, SBP has established a dedicated consumer protection department to deal \nwith consumer grievances and put in place an appropriate policy and regulatory mechanism to \nsafeguard consumer interests. In addition, a Consumer Protection Law is being drafted, which is \nexpected to be enacted during subsequent subprograms. This law is expected to address such \nissues as transparency, confidentiality, availability of statements, account servicing, protection \nagainst fraud, unfair contracts and lending practices, methods of debt collection, and arbitrary \npenalties. It will be based on international standards and best practices.  \n \n66.  Under subprogram 1, a concept paper has been developed to help finalize a deposit \nprotection law as well as to establish a deposit protection scheme to protect small depositors in \ncase of a bank failure. The most important consideration for depositors is that their money will \nbe safe and available when they need it.  \n \n3.  Develop and Implement a National Structural Transformation Strategy \n67.  Medium  to  long-term  product  diversification  and  structural  transformation. \nSubprogram 1 will set the stage for an effective, strategic, and well-coordinated industrial policy. \nPolicy setting and identification of implementing institutions will begin under subprogram 1 and \nanalytical work on industrial policy structures and institutions will be carried out, to be supported \nby subsequent subprograms. This analysis will be based on a systematic understanding of what \neconomic  subsectors  need  and  how  they  may  be  feasibly  enhanced  by  specific  sector \ndevelopment policies.  \n \n68.  This policy analysis will have a special focus on public\u2013private sector interaction. It will \nfocus on feedback and consensus building in (i) institutions for public\u2013private coordination of \nstrategies and investments, and (ii) structural transformation policies carried out by the public \nsector. Two current ADB studies will support the AETP: one, supported by TA,29 will undertake \nan in-depth analysis to identify the potential to diversify production and increase productivity in \nlight of the country\u2019s technological and social capabilities; the other, supported by a TA loan,30 \nwill develop a strategic framework for new business development in key areas in the context of \nthe heavy public sector infrastructure investments along the National Trade Corridor (NTC). \nUnder subprogram 1, a high-level steering committee reporting to the prime minister or the \ncabinet  has  been  established  to  lead  work  on  Pakistan\u2019s  structural  transformation.  The \ncommittee will prepare a work program to guide the preparation of a structural transformation \nstrategy, a reform and investment program, and an execution plan.

Adopt Measures to Facilitate Investments. Under subprogram 1, the Government has \ntaken several short-term measures to improve the investment climate. It has introduced risk-\nbased  customs  inspection  with  facilities  for  e-filing  and  payment  of  duties.  This  has \nsubsequently been extended to sales taxes. The Government has also introduced a pioneering \nprogram to support the development of the automobile industry, with the goal of increasing its \nshare of GDP from the current 2.8% in FY2006 to 5.6% in FY2012. \n \n70.  As  indicated  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  9),  future  subprograms  will  help  the \nGovernment to simplify labor laws and promote e-governance to improve delivery of public \nservices. It will also help to identify key sectors, prepare and implement development programs, \nstreamline the rules of business, and restructure some key ministries and agencies, based on \nthe recommendations of the structural transformation studies.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n71.  The  proposed  AETP  is  premised  on  three  key  principles.  First,  Pakistan  needs  to \naddress certain economic distortions in the short term, specifically by reducing and eventually \nabolishing inefficient subsidies and targeting them to benefit the poor and vulnerable. Second, \nPakistan needs to deepen financial intermediation and increase financial sector stability and \nsoundness. Third, Pakistan needs to diversify its economy and increase the share of industry \nfrom the current level of 26% of GDP and to increase the share of manufacturing with high \nvalue-added. In parallel, it needs to increase agriculture productivity and make its services \nsector produce greater value. \n \n72.  It is estimated that Pakistan will need more than $1.6 billion to transition from the \ninefficient subsidy schemes to a targeted cash transfer and food safety net program in the first \nyear of AETP, and about $3 billion to resolve the accumulated debt in the electricity sector. The \nAETP will help Pakistan to address the ongoing food and energy crisis in a systematic manner. \nSubprogram 1 is also one ADB\u2019s first responses to its developing countries\u2019 needs in the food \ncrisis, first announced by the President at the ADB Annual Meeting in May 2008 and contained \nin the Board information paper ADB\u2019s Response to the Food Crisis.31 \n \n73.  Structural transformation of an economy of the size and nature of Pakistan\u2019s cannot take \nplace quickly or through rigidly prescribed conditions. To achieve the principles laid out in \npara. 71, the AETP sets out a 4\u20135 year design and implementation period, and a cluster \nstructure of four subprograms that will provide flexibility to meet evolving circumstances. It sets \nout short-and medium-term actions, with changes to come beyond the program period. The \nAETP will only tackle the policy issues, with a large number of procedural and process-related \nchanges taking place in parallel to the proposed reform measures.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n74.  As noted in para.72, the costs associated with the reforms under the AETP (which \nincludes increases in subsidies as a result of price increases in food and oil) are significant in \nthe short term, and can go up to $5 billion in FY2009\u2013FY2012 to expand the social safety nets. \nThe Government has requested that subprogram 1 and subprogram 2 each be designed to \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2008.

Manila.   \n ", " 25\nprovide $500 million, with subprogram 1 to be submitted for ADB approval in September 2008 \nand subprogram 2 before the end of June 2009. For subprogram 1, two loans are proposed\u2014a \nloan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and a loan of $200 million \nequivalent from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). Subject to reform progress and availability \nof resources, subprograms 3 and 4 are each envisaged to be $400 million\u2013$500 million. Thus, \nthe overall amount for the AETP is estimated to be in the range of $1.8 billion\u2013$2 billion. \n \n75.  The OCR loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \nrate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms \nand conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n76.  The ADF loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n77.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the AETP. The Ministry \nof  Industries  and  Production;  Ministry  of  Commerce;  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and \nLivestock; Ministry of Water and Power; State Bank of Pakistan; Planning Commission; Federal \nBoard of Revenue; Engineering Development Board; and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal32 will be the \nimplementing agencies.  \n \n78.  The secretary of finance will steer the AETP. The financial management arrangements \nwithin MOF have been assessed as adequate. MOF\u2019s accumulated experience in implementing \na  large  number  of  program  loans  demonstrates  its  competence  and  capacity  to  carry  out \nfinancial management of the AETP effectively. ADB will monitor program implementation closely \nto ensure that envisaged outputs and outcomes will be achieved.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n79.  To ensure reform continuity as well as the predictability of support, the AETP will be \nstructured  as  a  program  cluster  of  four  single-tranche  subprograms  to  be  implemented \napproximately between June 2007 and July 2011.  \n \n(i)  Subprogram 1 (covering reforms from June 2007 to September 2008) addressing \nfood and energy crisis, supporting short-term investment climate measures, and \npaving way for medium-term structural transformation; \n(ii)  Subprogram 2 (October 2008 to June 2009) furthering reforms for structural \ntransformation; \n(iii)  Subprogram 3 (July 2009 to June 2010) expanding reforms to enhance private \nsector participation in key sectors; and \n                                                 \n32 Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal is a semi-autonomous organization established within the Ministry of Social Welfare and \nSpecial Education pursuant to the Bait-ul-Mal Act, 1991. \n ", "26 \n(iv)  Subprogram 4 (July 2010 to June 2011) marking completion of the initial phase \nof structural transformation.    \n \n80.

The loans for subprograms 2\u20134 will be processed \nsubject to adequate progress of reforms and the Government\u2019s continued commitment to the \nreform agenda.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Withdrawal Procedures \n81.  Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member countries, other \nthan  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  12)  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of the program loan will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures \nand related requirements for program loans. Loan proceeds disbursed against imports will \nrequire a certificate from the Government stipulating that the value of the total imports of \nPakistan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of \nloan proceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy  \n82.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the AETP. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations. \nTo mitigate the risk of corruption in the implementation of targeted subsidies, ADB will provide \nsupport  under  an  ongoing  TA  (footnote  27)  to  put  in  place  good  fiduciary  systems  and \nrequirements for the safety net programs. The TA will include 3 international person-months and \n12  national  person-months  of  fiduciary  expertise.  In  addition,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nexpertise will help to improve the safety net programs based on outcomes and lessons. \n \n5.  Counterpart Funds \n83.  The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated from the proceeds of the \nOCR loan shall be used first, to support the adjustment costs of reforms to be initiated and \nimplemented under subprogram 1, and second, to finance expenditures for the Government\u2019s \ngeneral development purposes. The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the ADF loan shall be used to support the poor and vulnerable households \nunder the two targeted social safety net programs set forth in output 1 of subprogram 1.  \n \n6.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n84.  The economic reform unit in MOF and SBP have established a performance evaluation \nsystem for the AETP, which includes a database on the status of policy measures and program \nindicators based on the policy matrix. They will take the lead in monitoring the implementation of \nthe AETP and its impacts and outcomes, and submit reports to ADB twice a year on program \nimplementation, including accomplishment of the measures set forth in the development policy \nletter  and  policy  matrix.  They  will  be  proactive  in  gathering  data,  updating  performance \n ", " 27\nindicators and proposing revisions as needed to ensure that data compiled provide useful \nguides to management decision-making by policy makers. Policy advisors may be placed within \nMOF  and  SBP  to  assist  in  monitoring  and  evaluation.  ADB  will  keep  track  of  program \nimplementation through regular reviews and progress reports throughout implementation. Based \non these reviews, modifications and improvements will be considered. The results framework in \nTable 4 and the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 identify the targets by which \nattainment of the outputs will be measured. In addition, each subsequent subprogram will \ninclude an appendix reflecting a summary assessment of the performance of each subprogram. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n85.  The proposed TA will help the Government to design and implement the reform agenda \nfor subprograms 2\u20134. The components of the TA are aligned with the principal areas of the \nAETP  and  include  support  for  implementing  structural  transformation  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment. The design for this TA takes into account existing TAs and will be supplemented \nby a subproject from ADB\u2019s ongoing governance TA cluster (footnote 27), financed by the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom. This subproject will focus on \nthe design and implementation of targeted safety net programs for the poor and vulnerable, \ngradual elimination of wheat and energy subsidies, and restructuring of the electricity sector \ndebt. Supplementary Annex C presents the full details of this TA. In addition, an ongoing TA will \nsupport Pakistan\u2019s anti-money laundering efforts (footnote 28). \n \n86.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,040,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $800,000 on a \ngrant basis from its TA funding program. The Government\u2019s contribution of $240,000 equivalent \nwill  cover  office  accommodation,  training  and  workshop  facilities  and  counterpart  support. \nProcurement of goods under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n87.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will help coordinate \nthe work of the TA with the implementing agencies. For the financial sector component, the \nwork will be coordinated and supervised directly by the concerned regulatory agencies. The TA \nwill  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  2  years  starting  in  October  2008  and  running  until \nSeptember  2010.  The TA  is  estimated  to  require  about 15  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 30 person-months of national consulting services. All consultants will be \nselected on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The impact, outcome and scope of the TA, outline terms \nof reference, and cost estimates are in Appendix 13. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n88.  The AETP will provide significant benefits and will have a positive impact on the poor. \nAppendix 14 presents the summary poverty reduction and social strategy prepared for the \nProgram. First, the immediate outcome of AETP, particularly under subprogram 1, will be to \nhelp Pakistan overcome the short-term exogenous shocks of spiraling food and fuel prices and \nmeet the immediate and large fiscal needs. Second, it will help the Government move away \nfrom  inefficient  and  untargeted  subsidies  to  a  targeted  safety  net  program  for  the  poor. \nBeginning  with  about  2  million  households  immediately,  and  expanding  to  cover  5  million \nhouseholds  during  the  2008-2009  fiscal  year  if  the  safety  net  program  implementation  is \nsmooth, the AETP could potentially target up to 9 million households. In parallel, the AETP will \n ", "28 \nalso assist the Government in embarking on a medium term reform agenda. As such, third, the \nAETP will raise public confidence in the banking system through a depositor protection scheme, \nand stronger financial intermediaries that are better able to mobilize and allocate resources and \nrisks. Fourth, the AETP will open the way forward for structural transformation, and in the \nprocess, it will help cut transaction costs for businesses (e.g., by reducing red tape in tax \npayments) and improve the investment climate. Fifth, the AETP framework will enable ADB to \nsustain policy dialogue on structural reform in sectors where ADB has been actively involved \nthrough past and current investments. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n89.  While some of the risks of the AETP are political and outside of its scope, the financing \nwill mitigate a range of others, including the following:  \n \n(i)  Interest group resistance. This is likely, as those affected by reforms in the \nshort-term  may  resist.  The  Government  is  adopting  a  good  communication \nstrategy to articulate the long-term and country stability interests that are behind \nthe  reforms.  Further,  the  program  cluster  nature  of  the  AETP  ensures  prior \nactions by the Government before financing is provided.   \n(ii)  Weak capacity. This is a generic concern, which is elevated in case of complex \nreforms. Adequate design and implementation support is being mobilized under \nAETP through technical assistance. \n(iii)  Global food and fuel crisis. The measures under AETP are predicated on there \nbeing  a  global  recovery.  Yet,  the  program  cannot  determine  global  events, \nalthough it can help cushion Pakistan against some exogenous shocks. \n(iv)  Lack of policy coordination. The AETP will demonstrate the clear benefits of \nproduct diversification, industrialization, processing and value creation and will \ntherefore help build consensus. ADB\u2019s current analytical and design work on \ntransformation is supported by well-known institutions, which will bring credibility \nto the reforms and help build momentum. \n  \n90.  The risk of not supporting Pakistan\u2019s safety net programs and longer-term economic \ntransformation is also high. In the absence of timely reforms, the Government\u2019s budget would \ncontinually  be  burdened  by  costly  and  inefficient  subsidies,  leaving  fewer  resources  for \ndevelopment financing, the financial sector would be vulnerable to systemic risks, and investors \nwould  be  vulnerable  to  market  fraud  and  misconduct.  Without  meaningful  structural \ntransformation,  growth  may  once  again  be  stalled  and  macroeconomic  stability  disrupted, \nreturning the country to the cyclical pattern observed in the past. High and persistent fiscal, \ncurrent  account  and  investment  deficits  could  lead  to  unsustainable  levels  of  public  debt, \nadversely affecting the country\u2019s macroeconomic environment, constraining investment and \neconomic growth, and aggravating poverty. \n \n91.  The underlying assumptions for the AETP include   \n \n(i)  strong and sustained leadership and commitment to reforms,  \n(ii)  development partner coordination, and \n(iii)  open dialogue with the private sector and other key stakeholders \n ", " 29\nVII.  ASSURANCES \n92.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken under subprogram 1, as set forth in the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, will be in effect for and beyond \nthe duration of subprogram 1. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation of subprogram 1 and will provide ADB with an opportunity to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government  will  take  into \naccount ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposal. \n(iii)  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  generated  from  the \nproceeds  of  the  ADF  loan  shall  be  used  to  support  the  5  million  poor  and \nvulnerable households under the two targeted social safety net programs set \nforth in output 1 of subprogram 1. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n93.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loans would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the program cluster to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Accelerating \nEconomic Transformation Program;  \n \n(ii)  the  loan  of  $300,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  first \nsubprogram of the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n \n(iii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 122,888,000 \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the first subprogram of the Accelerating \nEconomic Transformation Program from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n     President \n \n10 September 2008   \n ", "30  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks  \nMechanisms    \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nSustained high economic  Real GDP growth  National income  \u2022 Strong Government \ngrowth   sustained at 8% per  accounts  commitment \nyear over 2010\u20132020    \u2022 Private sector \n  SBP  responds positively to \nManufacturing  policy reforms \nsector\u2019s share of GDP   \nincreased to 30% by  Risks \n2020  \u2022 Resistance from \n  vested interest groups \nHigh-value added   \noutputa share of \nexports increased to \n40% by 2020 \n \nBanking sector credit \nto private sector \nexpanded to 42% of \nGDP by 2018 \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nInitiate structural  Manufacturing sector  National income  \u2022 Ongoing support and \ntransformation of Pakistan\u2019s  share of GDP  accounts  ownership by \neconomy  increased from 19% in    implementing agencies \n  FY2008 to 21% by  SBP  \u2022 Development partner \n  FY2012   support for reforms and \n  close coordination \nHigh-value-added         \noutput\u2019s share of  Risks \nexports  increased to  \u2022 Weak absorptive \nat least 15% by  capacity of \nFY2012  implementing agencies \n   \nBanking sector credit \nto private sector \nexpanded to 32% of \nGDP by FY2012 \n ", "  Appendix 1  31 \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks  \nMechanisms    \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nA.

Summary of the Fiscal Situation:  At the heart of Pakistan\u2019s unstable macroeconomic \nsituation today is a looming fiscal imbalance. The fiscal deterioration during fiscal year 2007/08 \nhas been serious enough for then incumbent (now resigned) Finance Minister to announce in a \npress conference after taking over that the fiscal deficit could rise to 10% of GDP if no mitigating \nmeasures were taken. The Government has since then taken a few measures to restrain the \nblooming imbalance through allowing a steady (but insufficient) rise in domestic oil prices since \n1 March, undertaking a small adjustment in the electricity tariff, cutting down of the Public Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (PSDP),  and  freezing  of  supplementary  grants  to  government \ndepartments. Based on the provisional figures for the fiscal year 2007/08, the fiscal deficit rose \nto 6.5% of GDP, thus breaching the 4% of GDP fiscal deficit ceiling mandated under the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2005. The Government continued to run a revenue deficit whereas it had \ncommitted in the Act to eliminate this deficit by the 2007/08 fiscal year. The fiscal situation, if not \naddressed,  will  have  a  profound  impact  on  overall  macroeconomic  stability  and  growth \nprospects of the country. This Note summarizes the key aspects of the fiscal challenge and \nexplains underlying reasons for the recent deterioration.   \n \n2.  Contextualizing the Fiscal Position:  Having run unsustainable fiscal deficits in the \nrange of 6-7% in the late 1990s, the Government undertook stabilization measures to contain \nexpenditure  and  improve  revenues  supported  initially  by  a  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nFacility (PRGF) of the IMF approved in 2001. Large capital inflows in the post September 11, \n2001 situation provided additional space to the Government to consolidate and improve its \ninternal fiscal balance while maintaining robust levels of development spending. By 2003/04, the \nfiscal deficit had come down to 2.4% of GDP. The deficit rose to 4.3% of GDP in 2005/06 \ncontributed by additional public spending on relief and rehabilitation in the aftermath of the \nOctober 2005 earthquake, higher subsidy on account of the rise in international oil prices, and \nrising development expenditure. This level of deficit was maintained in fiscal year 2006/07 on \naccount of a precipitous increase in interest payments and continued expansion in development \nexpenditure. The deficit jumped to 6.5% of GDP in 2007/08 as total expenditure rose sharply to \n21.3% of GDP, underpinned by an increase in current expenditure to 17.5% of GDP. Total \nrevenues on the other hand fell to 14.7% of GDP in 2007/08 from 14.9% in 2006/07, while the \ntax to GDP ratio stagnated at 10.1% of GDP (Table 1).         \n \nTable 1:  Summary of Fiscal Position (% of GDP) \n   2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08* \nTotal Revenue  13.8  14.2  14.9  14.7 \n     Tax Revenue  10.1  10.6  10.2  10.1 \n     Non-tax Revenue  3.7  3.6  4.7  4.6 \nTotal Expenditure   17.2  18.5  19.2  21.3 \n    Current Expenditure  13.3  13.6  14.9  17.5 \n    Development Expenditure  3.9  4.8  4.9  3.8 \nFiscal Deficit  3.3  4.3  4.3  6.5 \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008.

The  fiscal  deficit  in  fiscal  year \n2007/08 shot up to 6.5% of GDP from 4.3% of GDP in the previous period, exceeding the \ntargeted deficit of 4% of GDP for the year in a major way.  In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit in \n2007/08 was 81% more than the corresponding deficit in the last fiscal year. Why has this \nhappened?  In  a  nutshell,  there  has  been  a  major  overrun  of  public  expenditure  that  has \n ", "  Appendix 2  35 \noutpaced a significantly decelerated revenue collection. The fiscal issue, therefore, is both on \nthe expenditure and the revenue side. To start from the expenditure side, there are three key \nfactors explaining the high overrun: large increase in interest payments; bloated oil, energy, and \nfood subsidies; and rising development expenditure. \n \n3.1  Large  Increase  in  Interest  Payments:  Having witnessed modest growth in \nrecent years following consolidation of the total debt situation, interest payments on \npublic debt leaped by almost 49% during 2006/07 on the back of lumpy payments made \non maturing high interest bearing Defense Saving Certificates (DSCs) issued by the \nGovernment in the late 1990s (Figure 1). In fiscal year 2007/08, interest payments \ncontinued their upward rise to reach PRs528 billion \u2013 surpassing the budgeted amount \nby a significant margin of 21%. The lumpy interest payments will continue for the next \ntwo fiscal years and will continue to put pressure on the budget. Aside from the issue of \nlumpy  DSCs,  interest  payments  remained  high  on  account  of  the  growing  level  of \nabsolute debt, both domestic and foreign, that increased by over 10% in 2006/07 and \nanother 16% by end March 2007/08, as a result of the large fiscal and current deficits. \n      \nFigure 1:  Interest Payments \n(PRs Billion)\n600\n527.8\n550\n500\n450\n387.1\n400\n350\n300 273.9 260.0\n250 235.3 226.3 219.7\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n2001/02  2002/03 2003/04  2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08\n \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008. \nPakistan Economic Survey 2007-08.

Altogether the total subsidy level in 2007/08 \ntouched PRs407.5 billion\u2014almost four times more than the budgeted subsidy level of \nPRs113.9 billion (Figure 2). The major subsidy heads are four: oil, power, wheat, and \nfertilizer. The unprecedented increase in international oil prices resulted in an actual \nsubsidy of PRs175 billion \u2013 far above the PRs15 billion subsidy provided for this head in \nthe budget. The power subsidy arising from the tariff differential and other heads likewise \nrose to PRs133.3 billion \u2013against the PRs72.5 billion subsidy in the budget. The wheat \nsubsidy on imported wheat and that supplied at concessional rates through the Utility \nStores Corporation was in the range of PRs40 billion whereas no provision had been \nmade for this in the budget. The revised actual fertilizer subsidy of PRs29.5 billion is \nPRs16 billion more than the budgeted amount.  \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nFigure 2: Budgeted vs. Actual Subsidies for 2007/08 \n(PRs Billion)\n200\n175.0\n150 133.3\n100\n72.5\n50 40.0\n29.5\n15.0 13.5\n0\nBudgeted Subsidies Actual Subsidies\nOil Power Fertilizer Wheat\n \nSources:  Government of Pakistan, Finance Division 2007.

In absolute terms, development expenditure in 2006/07 was \nabout 19% higher than the previous fiscal year (Figure 3). At the start of fiscal year \n2007/08, being an election year, a record PSDP of PRs520 billion was announced in the \nbudget that was 20% higher than the actual development expenditure in 2006/07. With \nthe fiscal pressure imposed by interest payments and rising subsidies, the PSDP was \nsubsequently  reprioritized  to  concentrate  on  fast  moving  projects  and  financing  for \nprojects that had not yet been started was suspended.  As a result, the size of the PSDP \ncame down by about PRs62 billion in 2007/08. Going forward, the PSDP will need to be \nmaintained at a level that is consistent with the overall fiscal position of the Government \nand availability of external financing. In the current tight fiscal environment un-helped by \nthe high and rising subsidies, protecting spending for important infrastructure and social \nsector projects has become a key challenge.  \nFigure 3: Development Expenditure (PSDP)\n(PRs Billion)\n500 458.3\n433.7\n400 365.1\nn\no\nBilli 300 227.7\ns \nR\nP 200\n100\n0\n2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08*\n \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008. \nPakistan Economic Survey 2007-08.

But  the  tax \nperformance in 2007/08 was affected by the slowing down of economic activity and the \nFBR tax revenue target of PRs1.025 trillion, 21% higher than last year, was missed by \nPRs25 billion. Total tax collection by FBR grew by 16.9% in 2007/08 as direct tax \ncollection slowed, compared to its level last year, but still grew at a rate of 13.4% over \nthe previous fiscal year. But, as percentage of GDP the total tax collection by FBR1 fell \nto 9.4% in 2007/08 from 9.7% in 2006/07. Contributing to this jaded tax performance is a \ndecline in corporate profitability and political disturbances and the law and order situation \nresulting in closing down of businesses on several occasions in the latter half of 2007 in \nmajor cities.

Financing of the Fiscal Deficit:  Large external capital inflows between 2004/05 and \n2006/07 financed a significant part (47% on average) of the fiscal deficit (Figure 5). These \ninflows allowed the Government to contain its reliance on the domestic banking system and \nnon-bank  sources  for  financing  of  the  deficit.  However,  external  inflows  slowed  down \nsignificantly and financed only 17% of the fiscal deficit in 2007/08. The result was that the \nGovernment\u2019s dependence on the banking system3 increased dramatically to finance 83% of \nthe deficit, of which major chunk was borrowed from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).   \n                                                 \n1  Provincial governments\u2019 collected taxes and surcharges on gas and oil are not included in the tax collected by \nFederal Board of Revenue (FBR).  \n2  Total federal Government\u2019s tax revenue includes tax collection by FBR, provincial governments\u2019 collected taxes \nand surcharges on oil and gas. \n3  From 1 July 2007 to 14 June 2008, Government sector borrowing for budgetary support from State Bank of \nPakistan increased to PRs652 billion, whereas, the scheduled banks owed PRs179 billion to the Government on \nthe specified date. Therefore, net Government sector borrowing for budgetary support from the banking system \nwas at PRs473.1 billion compared to only PRs163.2 billion in the same period last year.     \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nFigure 5: Sources of Financing of the Budget Deficit (%)\n100%\n83%\n80%\n56%\n60%\n46%\n42%\n39%\n40% 31% 30%\n24%\n19% 17%\n20% 13%\n0%\n2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08*\nExternal Financing Domestic Financing Privatization Proceeds\n \nSource: Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008.

Economy Wide Impacts of the Fiscal Imbalance: Unabated public borrowing from the \nbanking system could ultimately also crowd out part of private sector credit and hurt private \ninvestment and growth.  Public sector investment is already going down as manifested in the \nslashing of the PSDP on account of the squeezed fiscal space \u2013this will also impact private \ninvestment and growth. The fiscal deficit is also main reason behind a rapid accumulation of \ndebt. As mentioned before, domestic debt grew by 15.8% in the first nine months of 2007/08 \ncompared to an average growth of 9.5% in past three years. At end March 2008, foreign debt \nalso increased by 17.2% compared to a 7% average in the past three years.    \n \n6.  Concluding Remarks: Pakistan\u2019s fiscal problems in 2007/08 are predicated not only on \nrising expenditures but also on stagnating revenues. A strategy to improve the fiscal situation \nwill thus need to rest not only on expenditure containment but also concrete steps to strengthen \nrevenue mobilization. On the expenditure side, leaving aside the non-discretionary interest \npayments, the Government needs to make a strategic resource allocation decision regarding \nthe extent to which it wants to continue to allow expenditure on subsidies to erode and crowd \nout the PSDP.  The level of subsidy this fiscal year is approximating the (now curtailed) size of \nthe PSDP and this has implications for public investment for strategic development projects at \nthe federal and provincial government levels. On the revenue side, serious efforts are required \nto enhance the tax base and bring the agriculture and services sectors in the tax net while \neliminating ad-hoc tax exemptions and rationalizing the burden of taxes on the manufacturing \nsector. The experience of the current year with falling capital inflows that has complicated the \nfinancing of the deficit only serves to bring in the limelight the challenge and need for raising \ndomestic revenues.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  39 \nECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN PAKISTAN \u2013 WHAT IS IT AND WHY IS IT NEEDED? \n \nI.  Macroeconomic situation \n \n1.  Pakistan has registered an average growth rate of 5.5% during 1960-2007. However, in \nper capita terms, and due its relatively high population growth, Pakistan\u2019s performance has \nbeen less successful, and between the mid 1980s and the early 2000s, the country\u2019s per capita \ngrowth rate showed a marked downward trend (Figure 1). Since 2001, however, this trend has \nshifted and it has improved substantially. Policy makers\u2019 objective is to maintain this good \nperformance in the medium term. \n \nFigure 1.

World Bank online database, 30 April 08.  \n \n2.  Achieving this objective, however, is not easy, as the economy faces two problems. One \nrefers to the recent macroeconomic performance. During the last few years, there has been an \naccelerating  erosion  of  the  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  stability.  Growth  has  relied  on \nexpansionary private and fiscal sectors and a contractionary external sector. This makes the \ncurrent growth model unsustainable. The second problem refers to the underlying path of \nstructural transformation of the economy. It is such that it is very difficult to transit to a higher \nand  sustainable  growth  path  along  the  lines  of  the  successful  East  and  Southeast  Asian \neconomies. Nevertheless, while challenging, the situation is not irretrievable. \n \n3.  The past three years have been beset by deficits in the private, public and external \nsectors. Figure 2 shows these macroeconomic imbalances. In the private sector, private savings \nhave been unable to keep up with growing private investment during the recent high growth \nyears. In the government sector, the tax revenue effort has stagnated and deteriorated as \ngovernment (both current and investment) spending has increased, partly spurring the current \nhigh growth. This has led to a serious fiscal deficit problem. These two deficits naturally have \nled to large external current account deficits. Indeed, exports plus net factor income from abroad \n(the latter made up mostly of remittances from overseas workers less foreign debt interest \npayments)  have  fallen  as  percent  of  GNP  in  recent  years  as  imports  have  increased \nsubstantially due to the country\u2019s high growth.  \n ", "40  Appendix 3 \n \nFigure 2.

Key Indicators 2007. Manila. \n \n4.  This analysis indicates that Pakistan\u2019s main macro challenges in the short to medium \nterm are:  \n \n(i)  To reduce the fiscal deficit by rationalizing spending and increasing the tax effort \n(rather than cutting vital public expenditures in social and economic services). \nEfforts must be directed toward reorienting poorly targeted subsidies and bloated \npublic sector expenditures, and raising revenues by broadening the tax base \nmeaningfully. This will free fiscal resources. \n(ii)  To reduce the growing and large current account deficit. Ideally, this should be \ndone by increasing exports (in particular their quality) and by reducing non-\nessential/luxury consumer imports. It is also hoped that the financing of the \nsignificant current account deficit will rely in the future less on volatile \u2018hot money\u2019 \n(portfolio flows) and loans, and more on foreign direct investment and productive \ngrants/aid;  \n(iii)  To  increase  private  savings  so  that  they  finance  to  a  larger  extent  private \ninvestment.  Private  savings  will  only  grow  if  income  per  capita  grows \nsignificantly, and if the share of consumption (about 70% of GDP) declines.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  41 \nII.  The Need to Industrialize \n \n1.  Why? \n \n5.  In the medium to long-term macroeconomic stability is a necessary, but certainly not a \nsufficient  condition,  for  a  country\u2019s  development.  The  latter  consists  in  the  upgrading  and \ndiversification of the production and export structures. Only the countries that succeed in this \nendeavor manage to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, and ultimately develop. \n \n6.  The development literature is filled with empirical evidence and examples that show that \nsuccessful development in a country like Pakistan entails passing through different stages, \nwhere the essence is the transfer of resources from the less productive sectors of the economy \n(agriculture in general) to the more productive sectors (industry and services in general). At one \npoint, manufacturing (and industry in general) must take the lead in the growth process, as this \nsector is characterized by increasing returns to scale. Likewise, development is accompanied by \ntechnological and scale upgrading of the products produced in the economy, especially in the \nmanufacturing  sector  (as  the  successes  of  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  [PRC],  Japan,  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  and  Taipei,China  the  show).  Finally,  the  literature  also  shows  that  the \nsuccessful countries enter a phase of fast export growth during which they manage to upgrade \ntheir export structures significantly. \n \n2.  Low industrialization and technological upgrading in Pakistan \n \n7.  Despite  Pakistan\u2019s  relatively  good  growth  record  over  the  last  decades,  its \nindustrialization achievement lags significantly behind that of other countries, especially those in \nEast and Southeast Asia. Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing output share in GDP is much lower than \nthat of PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. Moreover, the size of \nthis sector has barely changed in decades (during the last few years it has increased and it is \nalready close to 20%) (Figure 3).   \n \n \nFigure 3.

In terms of technology and scale, Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing is still dominated by products \nat the lower end (in terms of technology level) of the spectrum. Figure 4 provides the shares in \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nGDP of the different manufacturing branches.

The Figure shows that \nPakistan\u2019s manufacturing sector is still dominated by products that belong to group 1, unlike \nKorea  and  Malaysia  whose  manufacturing  sectors  are  dominated  by  high-tech  and  scale \nproducts (group 4).

Summing up, Figures 3 and 4 above indicate that Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing sector is \nsignificantly smaller than that of the successful Southeast Asian countries and that it needs \nsubstantial product upgrading. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  43 \n3.  Low export performance and sophistication \n \n10.  Pakistan\u2019s export performance also lags behind. Its exports per capita are very low, \nabout $110 (Figure 5), and even correcting for income per capita, the country\u2019s exports per \ncapita are smaller than what \u201cthey should be.\u201d \n \nFigure 5.

World Bank online database, 30 April 2008. \n \n \n11.  As noted above, Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing structure is tilted toward low technology and \nscale products. Given this, it is likely that the manufacturing structure will also be skewed toward   \nthe same type of products. The question is whether it is possible for countries like Pakistan to \nmove up in the development ladder. Standard trade theory seems to imply that indeed it is \npossible. This theory explains trade and production structures of a country based on its relative \nendowments of physical and human capital, labor, and natural resources, plus the quality of \ninstitutions. These variables determine countries\u2019 relative costs and the specialization pattern. \nAn implication of comparative advantage is specialization. It is a country\u2019s specialization in the \nproducts in which it has comparative advantages what raises the productivity of the economy. In \nthe standard theory, changes in the export basket are regarded as a passive consequence of \nchanging factor endowments, and, therefore, any attempt to reshape the production pattern \nbeyond the one set by the factor endowments is likely to fail and, even, to impede growth.   \n \n12.  However,  recent  research  examining  the  patterns  of  sectoral  concentration  and \ndiversification in a cross-section of countries finds a statistically robust U-shaped relationship \nbetween specialization and per capita GDP. It is found that as poor countries get richer, sectoral \nproduction becomes more diversified. This diversification process continues until relatively late \nin the development process, and, only after a country\u2019s income level reaches a threshold level, \nproduction patterns start to become more concentrated. The intuition behind this idea is that for \ncountries  to  be  able  to  manufacture  advanced  products,  they  must  have  mastered  the \nproduction of a relatively wide range of other products. This learning process provides them with \nthe necessary capabilities (e.g., production knowledge). This finding has a significant implication \nfor the development strategy for poor countries, since it suggests that economic diversification \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \nshould stand at the center of their development strategy. Figure 6 shows the specialization \nindex and per capita GDP of 14 Asian countries. Given its income level, Pakistan is still in the \ndiversification  stage  and  far  below  the  threshold  income  level  where  countries\u2019  production \nstructures start concentrating. For Pakistan, economic diversification is needed to bring the \neconomy to a higher income level. \n \nFigure 6.

This finding has led to the development of a new dynamic theory of trade by focusing on \nthe idiosyncratic elements of specialization patterns. A key argument is that not all goods are \nalike in terms of their consequences for economic growth performance; and that the current \nexport composition of a country can determine subsequent growth of that country. Specializing \nin some products will bring higher growth than specializing in others. \n \n14.  To show that some traded goods are associated with higher productivity levels than \nothers and that countries exporting higher productivity goods can perform better, we constructed \na quantitative index or export commodity score, denoted PRODY, that ranks traded goods in \nterms of their implied productivity. PRODY is constructed as a weighted average of the per \ncapita GDPs of the countries that export a product. In the second step, we construct the \nincome/productivity level that corresponds to a country\u2019s export basket, denoted EXPY, by \ncalculating the export-weighted average of the different PRODY of that country. EXPY shows \nthe implicit level of sophistication of a country\u2019s exports. \n \n15.  Figure 7 shows the evolution of EXPY for a group of countries, including Pakistan. The \nresults clearly show that Pakistan\u2019s EXPY has not improved, and the value has even decreased \n ", "  Appendix 3  45 \nsince the mid 1990s. Overall, it remains low compared with those of the other countries. For \nexample, India\u2019s EXPY in 1985 was 32 percent higher than Pakistan\u2019s; by 2006 it was 74 \npercent higher. This means that Pakistan is stuck into the export of products being exported by \npoor countries.  \n \nFigure 7.

Why has the sophistication of Pakistan\u2019s export basket stagnated? This can be seen by \nanalyzing the PRODY measure. Table 1 ranks exports (products with a share of at least 1% in \nthe export share) at the SITC 5-digit level according to PRODY in 2005, and shows the share of \nthese products in total exports. The table shows the top 17 exports (according to PRODY), \nwhich account for over four fifths of total exports. Pakistan\u2019s exports are heavily concentrated on \ngarments and textiles. The highest PRODY is in \u201cFabrics, woven of continuous synthetic fibres\u201d \nwith a value of 16,060. This value is approximately in the middle of the PRODY scale. The \nhighest PRODY value, at 31,288, corresponds to \u201cweighing machinery\u201d (obviously produced by \ndeveloped countries). Pakistan does not export (in many cases the share is literally zero) \nproducts with a PRODY above 16,000. However, if one takes into account Pakistan\u2019s level of \ndevelopment, this is quite an acceptable degree of export sophistication. The problem is that \nafter the share of \u201cFabrics, woven\u2026.\u201d peaked at about 10-11% in 1990 and 1995, it declined to \n2.09% in 2005.

Of textile, Other \ncotton fabrics, woven, bleached, dyed, etc.\u201d in total exports, with a much lower PRODY value of \n3,604 in 2005, increased from 11% in 1982 to 23% in 2005-2006. In other words, Pakistan has \nmoved into the low end textile and garment products, and this explains the overall low value of \nEXPY. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 3 \n \nTable 1:  Pakistan\u2019s Exports Ranked by PRODY (SITC 5-digit level) \nand Share (%) in Total Exports \nPRODY \n(%) in \nCommodity  PRODY  2005  1982  1985  1990  1995  2000  2005  2006 \nFabrics,woven of continuous \nsynthetic fibres  16060  7.2  0.10  3.06  10.11  11.33  8.88  2.09  1.15 \nMedical instruments & \napp.exc.electro medical  14254  5.3  2.49  4.06  2.80  2.44  2.10  1.72  1.51 \nOther requisites for outdoor \nsports  10476  6.3  3.50  3.81  3.83  4.24  3.71  2.77  2.80 \nFabrics, woven of \ndiscontinuous synthetic fibres  6142  0.3  0.19  0.01  0.00  0.01  0.01  0.23  1.72 \nStockings, etc., knitted or \ncrocheted not elast.  5662  1.9  0.00  0.00  0.73  1.85  0.77  1.58  2.01 \nOther made up textile articles, \nn.e.s.  5348  2.9  0.90  1.44  0.58  0.45  1.07  2.50  2.28 \nWomens, girls & infts outer \ngarmts, not knitted  3884  3.1  4.84  6.50  6.27  3.69  3.05  3.66  4.22 \nMens and boys outer \ngarments, not knitted  3772  5.4  2.30  2.88  4.47  5.02  7.26  6.61  6.52 \nOuter garments knitted, not \nelast.

Product space \n \n17.  Given the analysis of Pakistan\u2019s exports, the next question should be: can Pakistan \nupgrade its exports? Producing new goods is quite different from producing more of the same \ngood.  Each  product  involves  highly  specific  inputs  such  as  knowledge,  physical  assets, \nintermediate inputs, labor training, infrastructure, property rights, regulatory regimes, and so on. \nThe exact set of assets and capabilities required is unique for each product, but this set can be \nan imperfect substitute for the set of capabilities needed to produce another good. To every pair \nof goods, there is an associated notion of \u201cdistance between them\u201d: if the goods require highly \nsimilar inputs and endowments, then they are said to be \u2018closer\u2019; but if the products require \n ", "  Appendix 3  47 \ntotally different capabilities, then they are said to be \u2018farther\u2019 apart. The probability that a country \nwill  develop  the  ability  to  produce  one  good  is  related  to  its  installed  capabilities  in  the \nproduction of similar products for which the currently available capabilities can be easily applied \nand transferred. \n \n18.  Given the varying degree of specific assets between products, the speed of structural \ntransformation depends on the density of the \u201cproduct space\u201d (i.e., the range of products being \nproduced) near the area where each country has developed its productive capabilities. This \nmeans that the country\u2019s current production structure can determine future productivity of the \neconomy. If the specific capabilities used in the production of a country\u2019s basket can be applied \nto the production of products with higher productivity, then the country can easily diversify by \nshifting  to  rich-country  products.  Thus,  the  structural  transformation  of  a  country  is  path-\ndependent, and, hence, justifies government interventions in shaping the production structure \nfor the future development of the economy. \n \n19.  By using a network representation methodology, it is possible to construct the product \nspace in which node size represents world trade, node color shows the product classification \nand link color indicates a range in the proximity values (Figure 8). \n \nFigure 8:  Product Space \n \n \nSource: Hidalgo, C., B.

Given the product space, which is common for all countries, one can analyze how the \nspecialization pattern of a country can be changed over time. Products exported by a country \nwith  a  revealed  comparative  advantage  greater  than  unity  are  shown  with  squares  (  ). \nComparing changes of positions of the squares in the product space, we can analyze how the \nproduction structure or specialization pattern of a country has been evolved. Figure 9 shows the \nproduct space for Pakistan, Malaysia, PRC, and India in 1985 and 2000. \n \nFigure 9.

The figure shows that Malaysia has shifted its product structure from textiles in 1985 to \nelectronics in 2000, and that it has started producing some products located in the dense area \nof the product space. This implies that Malaysia will easily be able to upgrade its production \nstructure  to  products  of  higher  productivity  in  the  future.  The  PRC  and  India  have  also \nsuccessfully upgraded their production structure. By contrast, Pakistan\u2019s production structure \nremains  almost  same  in  2000  as  in  1985.  Pakistan  has  concentrated  on  low  productivity \ngarments and textiles, and cereals, and has failed to upgrade. \n \n22.  The speed at which countries can transform their productive structure and upgrade their \nexports depends on the path determined by their current production and export structures. \nPakistan\u2019s problem is that it has specialized in products that require assets and skills specific to \nlower productivity products, and which do not help in order to move to higher productivity goods. \n \nIII.  Policy Options \n \n1.  The Potential for Industrialization, Product/Technological Upgrading and \nProduct Space \n \n23.  Our previous discussion indicates that there is a clear need to plan and implement \npolicies that will bring out and facilitate innovation and growth in the industrial, manufacturing \nand high productivity sectors of agriculture, services and industry. How to achieve this poses a \nsignificant challenge, and is actually the key to successful economic development. The analysis \nabove points some directions on how to do this. Even if the low-tech group 1 (see Figure 4) \ndominates Pakistan\u2019s domestic manufacturing, the high-tech group 4 has the second highest \nshare. This means that there are sectors that may provide dynamism for the manufacturing \nsector to take off.   \n \n24.  Table 2 provides a breakdown of Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing sectors in the 1970s, 1980s \nand  1990s.  Low-tech  sectors  like  food  and  beverages,  textiles  and  apparel  dominate  the \nmanufacturing sector. However, their share is decreasing and these sectors are being partially \nreplaced  by  higher-tech  sectors,  especially  industrial  chemicals,  electrical  machinery  and \ntransport equipment. This gives Pakistan a golden opportunity to increase its dynamism and \ninnovation, so that high productivity and value-added are acquired in these sectors through \nproper economic incentives, infrastructure, specific inputs and institutional/legal setups (to be \ndiscussed in III.2). \n \nTable 2:  Pakistan Manufacturing Branches (%) \n  1970s  1980s  1990s \nFood and beverages  30.45  30.94  22.89 \nTextiles  27.78  18.14  25.06 \nApparel, leather, and footwear  2.04  2.37  2.80 \nWood and wood products  0.26  0.39  0.37 \nPaper and paper products  1.61  1.15  1.54 \nPrinting and publishing  1.22  1.06  2.00 \nIndustrial chemicals  11.20  14.29  15.50 \nPetroleum and coal products  5.27  6.01  3.26 \nRubber and plastic products  1.80  1.80  1.42 \nNon-metal mineral products  4.43  7.75  7.76 \nBasic metals  3.06  6.20  5.13 \nMetal products  1.62  1.06  0.81 \nNon-electrical machinery  1.84  2.14  2.09 \nElectrical machinery  3.31  3.26  5.43 \nTransport equipment  2.99  2.89  3.05 \nOthers  1.11  0.55  0.88 \nTotal  100.00  100.00  100.00 \nSource: Staff\u2019s calculations based on data from United Nations Industrial Development \nOrganization Industrial Statistics International Standard Classification Revision 2 (2005). \n ", "  Appendix 3  51 \n25.  Pakistan needs to rethink its export promotion policy and think in two possible dimensions. \nOne is to grow within existing products. Pakistan can export more of the same, or upgrade quality \nwithin products. The suitability of this dimension depends on how much room there is to upgrade \nquality within the existing basket, and how sophisticated that basket is. In the case of Pakistan, the \nincome elasticity of demand for exports (a proxy for non-price or quality competitiveness) is very low, \nclose to zero. This indicates that when foreign income increases by 1%, Pakistan\u2019s exports increase \nvery little if at all. Why? Because Pakistan exports inferior goods. This means that there is plenty of \nroom for overall quality upgrading, as foreigners do not perceive, in general, Pakistan\u2019s exports as of \nhigh quality. Remember (Table 1) that even within textiles, Pakistan seems to be moving down the \ndevelopment ladder. The question is how to improve, and to solve this problem Pakistan\u2019s public and \nprivate sectors must draw a plan. A second strategy is to grow through more of the same. Table 1 \nabove showed that Pakistan already has made inroads into some high-tech export products like \nwoven fabrics of continuous synthetic fibers, medical instruments and apparatus, and some requisites \nfor outdoor sports. Although the export shares of these groups have decreased in the 2000s, perhaps \nproper  policies  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  exports  of  these  products  and  make  them  more \ncompetitive in the world market. This is also a feasible strategy given that Pakistan\u2019s EXPY is relatively \nhigh given its level of income: Pakistan can grow within the existing export basket. \n \n26.  A third possibility is to move from existing products into new products. If Pakistan\u2019s actual \nexport basket were in a central part of the product space, then there would be an apparent and \nobvious path toward new products. However, this is not the case, as we saw above. Pakistan\u2019s \nexports are largely textiles, and most likely the current export package is intensive in capabilities that \nare not easily redeployed to alternative \u2013more sophisticated, products. In this case, there is not an \nobvious path to other parts of the product space, and a \u201cjump\u201d to a new part of the space is necessary. \nThis requires conversations with both public and private sectors in order to jointly identify these \nsectors. For example, the Ministry of Commerce has published targeted new export products that the \nGovernment would want to promote, namely, engineering goods, pharmaceutical products, carpets, \ngems and jewelry, Japonica (high value-added) rice, meat and fruits and vegetables. Feasibility \nstudies will be needed to see if these sectors are viable and whether the proper infrastructure, specific \ninputs, institutional/legal setting and economic incentives (discussed in III.2) are in place for these \nexports to take off and gain world market share. Box 1 provides an example of how Singapore \ndecided to venture a few years ago into biotechnology. \n \nBox 1.  Building the Biotechnology Industry in Singapore \nAfter making significant strides in electronics, engineering and chemicals, Singapore is now turning biotechnology into its \nnext manufacturing pillar, and is making huge investments to nurture its development. In the middle of 2003, the \nGovernment opened Biopolis, a S$500 million research park that provides facilities for biotechnology activities and provides \nlegal and laboratory support services. This first class facility is envisioned to create an atmosphere of inspiration and \ncreative thinking. It features, for instance, a S$33 million high tech airconditioning system which is planned to cool even \nopen-air parks.  Besides providing physical infrastructure, government initiatives also include research grants and tax \nincentives, funding startups, as well as education programs and scholarships to develop the workforce.  A chief executive of \na life sciences consulting firm predicts that government initiatives, in addition to already established pharmaceutical \ncompanies in the country, would allow manufacturing output to reach S$12 billion by 2005. \n  \nThe country\u2019s national policy of attracting foreign talent is contributing to the effort, particularly in training the \nworkforce. Some top scientists in molecular biology, cancer research, and neurology are already based in Singapore, and \nthe government encourages long-term assimilation into the society.  The country\u2019s attractiveness to researchers is also \nhelped by a strong intellectual property rights regime and a well-developed health care industry. \n \nThe government recognizes the risks involved, such as the long period before investment returns are realized (if \nat all) and the threat of workers trained in its facilities to seek better opportunities elsewhere, notably the US, Europe, and \nAustralia.  But it is determined to move ahead as the changing economic environment calls for it.  \n \nSource: Wong, Douglas, \u201cSingapore\u2019s Research Heaven Lures Scientists,\u201d Financial Times, Jan. 24, 2003 issue. \n ", "52  Appendix 3 \n2.  Growth Diagnostics and Industrial Policy \n \n27.  Undertaking the policy work discussed above requires a growth diagnostics approach. \nObviously,  industrialization  and  technological  upgrading  cannot  occur  without  increases  in \nproductive investments and capital formation in the proper sectors, especially since productive \ncapacity and technology are embodied in capital goods. The growth diagnostics approach aims \nat identifying the binding constraints in the economy that prevent investment and growth in \npotentially productive and dynamic sectors of the economy and, ultimately, industrialization. \n  \n28.  Bottlenecks or constraints to investment and industrialization in the productive sectors \nmay involve general problems such as poor infrastructure, poor energy generation, bureaucratic \nimpediments,  difficulties  and  delays  in  setting  up  and  undertaking  entrepreneurial  and \ninnovative activities, as well as political/economic instabilities. \n \n29.  But the binding constraints may also take the form of lack of economic incentives for \ninvestment and innovation/technological and scale improvements in dynamic sectors. The lack \nof incentives may be in the form of:  \n \n(i)  lack  of  specific  inputs  (such  as  specialized  infrastructure  \u2013  e.g.,  IT-related \ninfrastructure for computer-dependent sectors) and institutional/legal structures \nto facilitate specific economic sectors (such as the lack of public institutions to \ncater to the specific technical and regulatory needs of, for example, medical \ndiagnostics  \u2013  e.g.,  there  should  be  institutions  catering  to  the  training, \ncertification  of  good  quality  of  the  technicians  and  equipment,  and  legal \ninstitutions and procedures in case of charges of erroneous diagnoses). \n(ii)  lack of human capital and specialized skills needed for specific sectors (e.g., the \nlack of qualified engineers or software experts due to brain drain and/or lack of \ntraining/education facilities). \n(iii)  lack of technical, R&D and technological investments and support for potentially \ndynamic industries. \n(iv)  absence  of  (or  distorted)  economic  incentives  given  to  productive \nentrepreneurial,  as  well  as  innovative  and  activities  with  the  potential  to  be \ntechnologically upgraded. \n \n30.  All these possible constraints should be looked at in order to come up with policy \nsuggestions for manufacturing expansion and product upscaling. Section III.1 has identified \npossible potential and promising sectors. But it will take time to come up with a plan for \nmanufacturing expansion, product diversification and sectoral upgrading until all the above \npossible binding constraints are sufficiently studied and analyzed. Box 2 provides an example of \nhow India and South Korea approached the implementation of an industrial policy program with \nsignificantly different results. \n ", "  Appendix 3  53 \n \nBox 2. Industrial Policy in Korea and India \nJacobsson and Alam (1994) provide an example that shows that the correct implementation and design of a \nsuccessful industrial policy program requires not only a dose of creativity and experimentation, but also some \nclear guiding principles that combine a carrot to promote investments in nontraditional areas with sticks to wed \nout investment projects that fail. \n \nBoth India and Korea started producing hydraulic excavators (equipment used to remove soil and \nstones) in the 1970s. Both countries protected these infant industries by restricting imports of finished hydraulic \nexcavators. Technology was imported through licenses. Protection was supplemented by requirements for local \ncomponent inputs, which became more stringent over time. Despite these initial similarities, the development of \nthe hydraulic excavator industry differed substantially in the two countries, and the way India and Korea \npromoted their infant industries contrasts sharply. \n \nBy the late 1980s the two Korean excavator manufacturers, Samsung and Daewoo, were producing \nmore than ten times the annual production of Larsen and Toubro, the largest Indian excavator manufacturers. \nMoreover,  the  Korean  manufacturers  had  designed  and  developed  their  own  excavators,  which  were \ncompetitive enough to be exported starting in 1987. By contrast, none of the Indian manufacturers had \nintroduced an excavator based on their own design and none was in any position to export. \n \nTwo aspects of government policy in these countries are crucial in explaining this difference in industry \nperformance. First, although both governments guided private investment decisions in the industry, the Korean \ngovernment recognized the importance of economies of scale. It limited the Korean industry to two firms and \nallowed them to expand production capacity and exploit production economies. The Indian government, by \ncontrast, encouraged a large number of firms to enter the industry and limited their individual production \ncapacities in the belief that this would foster competition in an otherwise protected market. Second, the Korean \ngovernment managed to instill a sense of competition and dynamism in its two producers by announcing a \ncredible program of time-bound protection. Indian protection was not time-bound. This impending liberalization \nof the industry was the main factor driving the Korean firms to formulate a clear strategy for developing an \ninternationally competitive design for excavators and an export marketing plan. The cases of India and Korea \nreinforce  the  critical  role  that  greater  openness  after  a  limited  period  of  protection  plays  in  developing \ncompetitive infant industries. \n \n31.  Finally, it is important to stress the importance of having appropriate institutions in place \nto interact with the private sector and learn what new activities are being considered and what \npublic action is required for them to successfully emerge. Box 3 summarizes the characteristics \nof these institutions. \n \nBox 3. Institutions for Industrial Policy \nAccording to Rodrik (2004), the following are the basic elements of an institutional architecture of institutions for \nindustrial policy: (i) Place political leadership at the top; (ii) Set up coordination and deliberation councils; and \n(iii) Set up mechanisms of transparency and accountability. And he proposes ten design principles for the \nformulation of industrial policy: (i) Incentives should be provided only to \u201cnew\u201d activities; (ii) There should be \nclear benchmarks for success and failure; (iii) There must be a built-in sunset clause; (iv) Public support must \ntarget activities, not sectors; (v) Activities that are subsidized must have the clear potential of providing \nspillovers and demonstration effects; (vi) The authority for carrying out industrial policies must be vested in \nagencies with demonstrated competence; (vii) The implementing agencies must be monitored closely by a \nprincipal with a clear stake in the outcomes and who has political authority at the highest level; (viii) The \nagencies  carrying  out  promotion  must  maintain  channels  of  communication  with  the  private  sector;  (ix) \nOptimally, mistakes that result in \u201cpicking the losers\u201d will occur; and (x) Promotion activities need to have the \ncapacity to renew themselves, so that the cycle of discovery becomes an ongoing one. \n \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 4 \nSOCIAL PROTECTION AND SAFETY NETS IN PAKISTAN \n \n1.  The  National  Social  Protection  Strategy  which  aims  to  bring  social  safety  nets  to \n6.2 million households in the next five years was approved by the Government of Pakistan (the \nGovernment)  in  2007.1 Pakistan\u2019s  existing  safety  nets  include:  (i)  cash  transfers  (Zakat, \nPakistan  Bait-ul-Mal\u2019s  Food  Support  Program,  and  conditional  cash  transfers);  (ii)  Old-age \nincome security (pension for Government employees, employees old age benefit institutions); \n(iii)  other  employment-based  programs  (Workers  Welfare  Fund,  programs  through  various \nfoundations);  (iv)  Micro  credit  and  NGO  programs  (Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund, \nKhushhalibank,  Rural  Support  Programs  etc);  (v) Public  works  Programs;  (vi)  food  based \nprograms (Tawana Pakistan Mid-day school meals); (vii) wheat subsidy; and (viii) social security \nprograms (pension - old age, survivor and disability and benefits to formal sector workers).  \n \n2.  Prior  to  the  2007  Strategy,  there  was  no  overarching  social  protection  strategy  in \nPakistan. It obviously led to lack of direction and poor coordination on the part of individual \nagencies and programs working in this area. The absence of a social protection strategy could \nalso explain the low and irregular budgetary allocations for the purpose. Public spending on key \nsafety net programs is only 0.5% of the GDP. This is low by international standards and \ninadequate to meet existing needs. It is hard to assess the effectiveness of these programs in \naddressing poverty and vulnerability given a lack of monitoring and supervision system, any \nthird  party  verifications,  and  feedback  loops  for  self-correction  and  learning.  Organizations \nimplementing  safety  net  programs  are  involved  in  multiple  activities  not  part  of  their  core \ncompetency  (running  schools,  hospital,  training  centre  etc.)  hence  thinly  spreading  limited \nresources and providing no synergies between agencies and program. There is no systematic \ntargeting and beneficiaries are selected on the basis of administratively determined criteria. \nAd hoc selection process of beneficiaries, distribution system and discretion of the government \nfunctionaries leaves room for leakage of funds. All this has reduced the effectiveness of the \nprograms and lowered their credibility in public eye.2 \n \n3.  Pakistan offers income support through two cash transfer programs, Zakat and Bait-ul-\nMal. Zakat, managed by federal Ministry of Religious Affairs, Zakat and Ushr, is a State-based \noption for Muslims to meet their charitable obligations through a deduction once a year at the \nrate of 2.5 per cent on the value of certain financial assets.3 It applies only to Sunni Muslims and \nothers can choose not to be included in the scheme and make their zakat privately. Pakistan \nBait-ul-Mal (PBM) is a semiautonomous organization within the Ministry of Social Welfare and \nSpecial  Education.  Bait-ul-Mal\u2019s  objectives  as  stated  in  the  Bait-ul-Mal  Act  are  to  provide \nfinancial assistance to destitute and needy widows, orphans, invalid, infirm and other needy \npersons. Unlike Zakat, Bait-ul-Mal benefits are open to all regardless of creed. Also, unlike \nZakat, the funds are entirely controlled by public servants. It has offices at provincial and district \nlevels that are closely linked to, but not part of provincial administrations.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of Pakistan. 2007.

The Vision of the Strategy is to \ndevelop an integrated and comprehensive social protection system, covering all the population, \nbut especially the poorest and the most vulnerable. The Core Instruments proposed by the \nStrategy include expanding the coverage of cash transfers using conditional cash transfers \n(CCTs) supplemented with unconditional transfers (through the Food Support Program (FSP) \nand Zakat) among others. PBM is undertaking efforts to improve targeting, delivery mechanisms \nand monitoring through a number of initiatives. They are in the process of cleaning-up their \ndatabase and creating a comprehensive computerized Management Information System based \non relatively authentic Computerized National Identity Cards (CNIC). Developing, piloting and \nexpanding proxy means tested targeting mechanism in combination with community validation \nis expected to enhance transparency and credibility of the system. Fiduciary risks are being \nminimized through improved financial management and introduction of consolidated accounts at \nthe field level to ensure effective reconciliation.    \n     \n6.  The Government has announced the launch of a new cash transfer program in addition \nto the already existing program of Zakat, Bait-ul-Mal, and provision of food items at subsidized \nrates through the existing and expanded network of government-run Utility Stores. The new \nprogram, named after the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, is called \u201cBenazir Income Support \nProgram\u201d. For this purpose, the Government has allocated an amount of PRs34 billion to be \nraised to PRs50 billion in the future. The program entails provision of a cash grant of PRs1000 \nper month to each qualifying household to be selected through a means tested program based \non the CNICs. Relying on this system will require the Government to address the coverage \nissues of the CNIC database. Additional TA will be required to develop systems for the new \nscheme.  \n \n7.  Despite challenges, it is clear that the Government not only has existing safety nets but \nalso intends to improve their coverage and targeting. The programs are expected to target more \nthan 5 million households. They have also substantiated their intentions by allocating substantial \namounts in the budget. Subject to improving systemic issues, the programs have a significant \nscope and need for expansion. World Bank is working with the Ministry of Social Welfare and \nPBM to improve targeting of their existing programs. UN has fielded a joint mission to asses the \nsituation and propose immediate and medium to long-term measures in the wake of recent food \ncrisis.  \n                                                 \n4  Its largest program that provides PRs2400-3000 a year for persons whose income is less than PRs4000/month. \nThe program guidelines require that assistance be provided to needy individuals following an order of priority. \nMeeting the criteria does not guarantee receiving the benefit as each district has a quota of recipients that it cannot \nexceed.  \n5  Asian Development Bank. 2004.

The Wheat Economy \n \n1.  Wheat is the basic staple food of Pakistan. Wheat is the major Rabi (winter season) crop \nsown in October-December and is harvested in March to early May. It provides 70% of total \nproduction of food crops, occupies 37% of total cropped area, and generates 39% of the value \nadded of major crops. Production, which has been increasing since the 1990s, averaged yearly \nat 20.1 million tons from 2000-2007. Of this total, Punjab\u2019s share was 80%, followed by Sindh at \n12%, NWFP at 5% and Balochistan at 3%. In 2007-2008, the government projected a bumper \ncrop of 23.5 million tons.  \n \nTable 1:  Wheat Production and provincial share, 2000-2007 (000 tons, (%) \n \nYear  Punjab  Sindh  NWFP  Balochistan  Pakistan \n2000-07  16,060  2,409  1,003  602  20,075 \n(80)  (12)  (5)  (3)  (100) \n \n             Source: Agriculture Statistics of Pakistan; ADB staff estimates \n \n2.  Table 2 shows the supply and demand situation for the period 2000-2007. Pakistan is \nmarginally sufficient, with most of the produce (roughly 65-75%) being kept by wheat farmers for \nhousehold consumption, feeds, and seeds. Domestic wheat consumption is supplied largely \nthrough the marketable surplus (mainly from Punjab) and partly through imports. Wheat is also \nexported but mainly to Afghanistan. In 2007-2008, government projected a huge bumper stock \nand decided to export some of the produce. The registered export volume though may be \nunderestimated because of the largely unrecorded exports to the porous borders between \nPakistan and its neighboring countries, Afghanistan and Central Asia, estimated at about 1-2 \nmillion metric tons.    \n \nTable 2:  Wheat Balance, FY2000-FY2008, average million metric tons \n \nTotal  Per capita \nOpening  Total  Food  Feed  Other  Pop\u2019n \n  Prod\u2019n  Imports  Domestic  Exports  consumption \nStocks  Supply  Use  Use  Use  (million) \nUse  (kg/yr) \nFY2000- 1.9  20.5  0/73  23.1  20.0  0.18  0.85  21.0*  0.25  129.8  153.9 \nFY2007 \nFY2008,                       \nOriginal  2.3  22.5  1.5  26.3  20.9  0.2  0.9  22.0  0.13  130.5  160.1 \nRevised  0.5  20.5  2.5  23.5  23.5 \nTotal domestic consumption is computed to include the projections of wheat flour that is sold to Afghanistan. \nAfghanistan is considered as the fifth\u201d province of Pakistan when it comes to wheat consumption.   \nSource: FAO crop statistics, MINFAL \n \nII.  Wheat - A Political Commodity \n \n3.  The government accords highest priority to providing wheat products at affordable prices \nto its consumers, mainly urban consumers. In the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of \n2004-05, household expenditure\u2019s share on wheat products is 15.9%, the second highest in the \nbasket of 17 major food items, with the first being fresh milk at 17.4%. The response of \ngovernments in the past and in the present has been to intervene on one hand at the farmer \nlevel, specifically by guaranteeing wheat farmers with a price that would at least cover his costs \n ", "Appendix 5  57 \nof producing wheat, and on the other, at the consumer level by ensuring an affordable price \nthrough subsidized wheat price and quota allocations accorded to the flour mills. The market \nshare of government procurement to total wheat production averaged at 27% for the years \n2000-2007. The surplus provinces, Punjab and Sindh, provided 70% and 10%, respectively, of \nthe  marketable  surplus.  Deficit  provinces,  NWFP  and  Balochistan,  provide  insignificant \nprocurement shares, while the federal government\u2019s wheat marketing arm, PASSCO, averages \nat around 20%.  \n \n4.  To support the regulated prices and procurement activities at the farm and flour mill \nlevels, the government through its PASSCO, Trading Corporation of Pakistan, and the provincial \nFood Departments/Directorates, administers the trading and marketing of the wheat reserves or \nbuffer stock as well as the import and export of the commodity. These regulatory measures are \nsupported by state-owned storage facilities, procurement centers, and utility retail stores, as well \nas easy access to credit from the State Bank of Pakistan and commercial banks. Tables 3 and 4 \nprovide indicative amounts of Government subsidies for wheat price stabilization purposes at \nthe  federal  and  provincial  levels.  Overall,  the  budget  support  for  performing  this  role  is \nsubstantial.  \n \nTable 3.

Flour mills, especially the inefficient ones, also benefit from the subsidy (Table 6).

Towards a Phased Market-Based Wheat Policy: 2005-2007 \n \n8.  Under  the  ADB-funded  Agriculture  Sector  Program  Loan  Phase  II  (ASPL  II),  the \ngovernment agreed to remove the pervasive public sector interventions in the wheat market \nwhich created disincentives for wheat producers, millers, and traders to become efficient and \ndevelop  an  integrated  food  industry.  These  measures  included  the  removal  of  market \nrestrictions in trade, elimination of consumer subsidies and producer support subsidies, the \nrestructuring and divestiture of PASSCO and provincial food departments and closure of food \ndirectorates, and a streamlined role in wheat reserve management. Because of the politically \nsensitive nature of the wheat policy and the volatile sociopolitical situation in the first half of \n2000s, a phased market-based wheat policy was deemed as the most politically feasible to \nachieve. The key elements of the phased market-oriented wheat policy are:   \n \n\u2022  Five-year phased policy reform of reducing the operational reserves to equate to the \nstrategic reserves by 5th year. Strategic reserves assumed to be equal to 1 million \ntons  \n\u2022  Implement a price band: lower limit is the support price to farmers, and the upper \nlimit is the price accorded to consumers. Within the price band, allow the private \nsector to undertake trading activities to farmers, flour mills, and consumers.  \n\u2022  No restrictions of wheat trade at intra- and inter-provincial levels.  \n\u2022  No restrictions of import and export of wheat. Enable private sector to engage in \nexternal  trading.  The  Government  imports  only  when  domestic  consumer  price \nmoves above it and private sector is not forthcoming.  \n\u2022  There was agreement that support price would move toward the export parity level, \nwhile  the  consumer  price  would  move  to  the  import  parity  price  level.  Price \nstabilization  function  would  be  only  performed  through management  of  strategic \nreserve. \n\u2022  Blanket consumer subsidy will be removed. Instead, a targeted food safety net will \nbe developed for the poor and vulnerable.  \n\u2022  PASSCO and food departments are to be restructured.  \n\u2022  Agriculture Pricing Commission (APC) changed to Agriculture Policy Institute (API) \nwhich, among others, would also monitor the pricing movements and provide policy \nadvice through good technical analysis. \n  \n9.  The environment during 2005-2007 was an opportune time to put in place the phased \nmarket-based wheat policy reform agenda as there were no major internal e.g., major drought, \nfloods, political change came in latter part of 2007 and did not have an effect on the wheat \nsituation, etc.) or external shocks that would have resulted in disruptions of the food supply and \ndemand conditions. These \u201cnormal\u201d conditions enabled the federal and provincial government to \ntry out more private sector participation in the trading and marketing aspects, particularly the \ndomestic and external trade activities. Farmers also had the opportunity of more market options, \ngovernment (at GMP  price or procurement/market-based price) and private sector). Prices \nreceived by consumers were fairly stable. Urban incomes were also rising, thus reducing the \nconsumption  for  wheat  products  and  increased  demand  for  livestock  products.  Local \ngovernment\u2019s  coercive  measures  to  meet  procurement  targets  were  also  minimized.  More \nimportantly, consensus building between federal and local governments on the phased market-\nbased wheat policy resulted in agreements on the implementation of the policy.  \n \n10.  At the end of ASPL II in mid-2007, the gap between the support and issue prices with \ntheir international price parity levels was decreasing; the restructuring plans for PASSCO and \n ", "60  Appendix 5 \nfood  departments/directorates  were  completed,  there  were  no  domestic  and  international \nrestrictions in wheat trade, and operational reserves were being reduced gradually.  \n \n11.  Figure 1 plots the support price of wheat with the market price in Rawalpindi, a proxy \nindicator  of  the  export  parity  price  at  Afghanistan  border  for  the  years  of  the  ASPL  II \nimplementation from 2004-2007. It is noticeable that the support price has moved much closer \nto the market price especially during the ASPL II years when the phased wheat market-based \npolicy was introduced (starting 2005). The price differential between the support and the market \nprice in 2004-2005 was PRs1,469 per tonne; the gap decreased to PRs863 per tonne in 2005-\n2006, or a 59% decline in price gap. By 2006-2007, the price differential between the support \nand market price was just PRs298 per tonne. However, at the height of the wheat price upsurge \nbeginning in mid-2007 (which also coincided with the completion month of ASPL II) and during \nthe political uncertainty, the average price difference jumped to PRs3,125 for the months July \n2007-May  2008.  There  is  a  need  to  safeguard  the  policy  commitments  of  Government  to \nremove the support and issue prices for wheat and wheat flour, respectively.  \n \nFigure 1: Support and Market Prices, 2004-2008 \n(PRs/tonne)\n40,000\n35,000\n30,000\n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0\n2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08\nProcurement Price Market Price*\n \n* Rawalpindi market price as proxy to Afghan border price for wheat \nSource: Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock, Government of Pakistan \n \n \n12.

Present Situation- Challenging Global and National Political Economy Landscape \n \n13.  The newly installed government faced several problems when it assumed power in late \n2007.   \n \n\u2022  Global Food Insecurity through Food Price Hikes: Among the most pressing problem \nfacing the new government is the rising food prices, especially the main staple, \nwheat.  A  confluence  of  global  factors  resulted  to  this  phenomenon:  high  food \ndemand and changing food consumption patterns, increasing energy prices which \nencourage shift in production land use from food to alternative biofuel, increased \nland cultivation for feeds, and structural neglect in agriculture investments.   \n\u2022  Mismanagement of stock reserves: From the viewpoint of the public at large, the \nrising wheat (flour/atta) price is perceived largely as the gross mismanagement of the \nwheat  situation  by  previous  government.  The  main  problem  was  that  the \ngovernment\u2019s issued price for wheat flour per 20 kgs was too low (PRs425/24 kgs) \nvis-\u00e0-vis the market price (PRs625/40 kgs), resulting in increased leakages and \ncorruption, not to mention the huge subsidy cost incurred by the government (about \nPRs4.4 billion as consumer subsidy). Traders, flour millers, and households near the \nborders of Afghanistan benefited from the low price of wheat flour, but not the poor \nconsumers. Further, because of the higher price hike of coarse rice and maize which \nare used for animal feed, livestock farmers substituted coarse grain and maize with \nmore wheat use. About 1 million tons of wheat was diverted to animal feed. In the \nend, the previous government had to import 1.7 million tons at already high global \nprices, resulting in another fiscal burden of about PRs50 billion. \n\u2022  Increased competition between public and private sector players: To some extent, \nfarmers benefited from the high wheat prices. The private sector was quite effective \nat purchasing from farmers. The Food department of Balochistan for example, could \nonly purchase 2 MT out of their procurement target of 20 MT.     \n\u2022  Tight Supply for FY2009: The present and newly installed government is thus under \ngreat pressure to act due to the very tight supply situation: Opening stocks for May \n2008 were down to 0.2 million tons. Latest estimates of wheat production are down \nto 22.8 million tons. Requirements for 2008-2009 are 23 million tons, meaning that \nstrategic reserves is just 0.5 million tons, 0.5 million tons short from the desired \nstrategic reserves. Some argue that the strategic reserves of 1 million tons may be \nlow as this was an outdated estimate when population of Pakistan was below the \n100 million mark.  \n ", "62  Appendix 5 \n\u2022  Poor and vulnerable affected most by the wheat price hike: An ADB study (2008) on \nthe impact of price increases on Pakistan\u2019s poverty situation concluded that a 10% \nprice hike in wheat prices would result in an additional 7.05 million poor Pakistanis \n(in 2004-05, the number of poor was 33.35 million), at 20%, the number of additional \npoor would more than double at 14.7 million, and at 30%, an additional 22 million. \nThe study also noted that subsidy for  the old and new poor would involve  a hefty \nsum ranging from PRs18,537.61 million (or 0.29% of GDP) if there were a 10% \nincrease in the food prices, to as much as PRs83,203.69 million, or 1.28% of GDP, if \nthe food price increases were 30%. \n \n14.  The second-half of 2007 when global food prices increased dramatically and global food \nreserves dwindled to low levels, thus became the litmus test on Government\u2019s commitment to \nsustain the phased market reforms in wheat. Because of the strong profit incentives to be \ngained from higher prices for wheat and wheat products, the Government, despite its efforts to \ndefend  the  public-determined  prices  of  wheat  and  wheat  products  and  its  use  of  various \ncoercive methods to restrict domestic trade and achieve its procurement targets, was powerless \nwith the interplay of market forces. The poor and vulnerable bore the brunt of high food prices \nand inaccessible food as the Government\u2019s food security strategy did not have an effective \ntargeted safety net measure in place. The government also mismanaged its stock reserves.  \n \n15.  High  wheat  prices,  increased  global  food  price  volatility,  and  heightened  market \nuncertainty are projected in the medium-term. There is thus popular pressure on the new \ngovernment to revert to increased public role in the wheat sector as the way for ensuring food \nsecurity as demonstrated by recent policies of government:  \n \n\u2022  Increased imports from 1 million tons to 2.5 million tons. But these will be coursed by \nTrade Development Authority through PASSCO and the food departments.  \n\u2022  Due to fiscal pressure the food departments were also instructed not to provide \nwheat at subsidized rate to millers. Punjab has agreed to provide 50,000 MT from \nPunjab flour mills at the price of 365 PRs/40kg (for one month only) these will be \ntraded by private traders- According to FD this measure will expose local millers to \ncompetition. \n\u2022  All provinces have imposed ban on inter province and inter district wheat movement \nespecially  during  the  duration  of  the  procurement  by  the  food  department- \nBaluchistan province has applied this measure in 3 surplus district for 15 days but \nthe measure was lifted due to political pressure. In addition the measure did not help \nas FD could only procure 10% of the target of 20,000 MT for this year.  \n\u2022  Punjab has again restricted inter-provincial wheat trade movement. NWFP cannot \naccess cheaper PFD wheat, but mainly PASSCO\u2019s more expensive wheat. \n\u2022  Exports of wheat were discouraged: (i) federal level \u2013 issuance of a wheat export \nduty of 35%; (ii) coercive measures to stop wheat exports to higher-priced AFG \nmarket \n\u2022  GMP or support price increased twice: (i) from PRs450/40 kg to PRs625/40 kg, \nwhich is still below the open market of PRs700/40 kg. The amount was still not \nsufficient to account for the rising input prices, especially fertilizers.  \n \n16.  It is essential that the investments in ASPL II of laying down the phased market reform in \nthe wheat policy be sustained and its implementation be accelerated. Key policy measures that \nwill need be brought to their logical conclusion are the: (i) elimination of consumer subsidy for \nwheat and movement to market-based sale price for wheat, and (ii) elimination of producer \n ", "Appendix 5  63 \nsubsidy by moving from a support price to a market-based price for the procurement of wheat, \n(iii)  efficient  management  of  the  strategic  reserves,  (iv)  non-restrictions  of  domestic  and \ninternational  wheat  trade,  and  (v)  streamlined  roles  of  PASSCO  and  food \ndepartments/directorates on strategic reserve management. These should be complimented \nwith policies that provide targeted safety net measures for the poor and vulnerable groups, and \nmeasures  that  promote  new  financial  instruments  and  institutional  arrangements  for  the \neffective and efficient integration of the farms with the consumers through appropriate provision \nof private sector-run market infrastructure and services.  \n \nV.  Key Desirable Features of a Policy Agenda for Sustainable Food Security \n \n17.  Towards a common understanding of the meaning of food security: \n \n\u2022  Food security as defined in the World Food Summit (Rome 1996) is a situation \n\u201cwhen all people, at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, \nand nutritious food and to meet their dietary needs and food preference of an active \nand healthy life.\u201d \n\u2022  Food security is measured in terms of (i) physical access to food (or availability), \neconomic access to food, and biological utilization of food (food absorption). Many \nstudies note that in Pakistan, physical availability of food (including wheat flour) may \nnot be the main issues, but rather consumers are constrained by poverty or their low \nincomes that in turn, impedes their ability to use the food adequately for a balanced \nproper nutrition. \n  \n18.  Appropriate direction of Food Security Policy:  \n \n\u2022  In  the  short-term,  food  security  should  safeguard  the  food  availability  and \naccessibility  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  For  farmer  producers,  a  guaranteed \nminimum price (but indexed on both costs of production and the export parity level) \nmay be needed to enable farmers to reap some of the economic gains of wheat price \nhikes.  \n\u2022  In  the  medium-term,  food  security  cannot  be  sustained  through  provision  of \nconsumer and producer subsidies. Measures that enhance economic activities and \njob creation would be a more sustainable basis for the poor to cope with food price \nspikes. Further, higher productivity of the food producing sector and its integration to \na  more  efficient  and  effective  integration  of  the  food  supply  chain  are  required \ninstead of distortionary price supports. Specifically, farmers need to be equipped with \naccess  to  (i)  high  yielding  seed  varieties,  modern  technology  and  agronomic \npractices and secured water supply and land use rights; as well as (ii) access to \naccurate information on market conditions, market infrastructure, and institutional \narrangements that effectively link them to the domestic and global market. With \nthese, the farmers can make the right choices and to realize profits from evolving \nglobal trading system.        \n \n19.  In the Pakistan context  \n \n\u2022  Immediate and priority focus of the Government should be to ensure the food \navailability and access of wheat flour especially for the poor and vulnerable groups. \nKey agenda for action are-  \n ", "64  Appendix 5 \n(cid:131)  Build up the strategic reserves through a more cost-effective and market-oriented \nreserve stock management system. \n(cid:131)  Develop and implement a targeted food safety net program with a time-bound \nexit strategy.   \n \n\u2022  The  medium-term  (1-5  years)  agenda-  building  blocks  for  structural \ntransformation from low-based food to integrated food supply  chains: The \nGovernment should lay the policy, institutional, and investment reform measures that \nwill develop a market responsive wheat/food supply chain network.

One of the major challenges facing Pakistan is its current energy crisis that is intense, \ncostly  and  multidimensional.  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  is  marred  with  twin  deficits  \u2013 \ntechnical/energy  and  financial/fiscal  \u2013  and  prevailing  power  shortages  underscore  urgent \nattention to prevent serious derailment of economy. Electricity sales rose 40% in the five years \nending 30 June 2007, while generation capacity remained practically stagnant. It is estimated \nthat the system lacks about 5000 MW to cover peak demand with acceptable reliability. With \ndemand expected to grow at 7-8% per year in the medium-term, current plans for capacity \nadditions need to be revised upward to eliminate shortages. On the financial front, the sector \nneeds significant fiscal support - estimated at US$2.0 billion for FY2008 (close to 20% of the \nprojected operating revenues and 1% of GDP) to cover the revenue deficit. \n \n2.  The energy insecurity and the poor electricity service have been identified as major \nconstraints  to  the  country\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  and,  hence,  it\u2019s  ability  to  alleviate \npoverty. The fiscal imbalances have created an inter-corporate circular debt problem, impeding \nthe power generation companies to reach optimal production levels. Currently the financial \nhealth of sector power entities is precarious caused by delayed and partial implementation of \nnecessary and agreed reforms. Tariffs must keep up with costs (of operating, maintaining, and \nexpanding the system) particularly in an environment of rising fuel costs given Pakistan\u2019s large \nthermal generation capacity. In the power sector, distribution companies have not been able to \ncharge  cost  recovery  rates  whereas  the  generation  companies  and  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs) have had real cost adjustments for their tariffs. The deficit amount is covered \nby the Government as a subsidy to the electricity customers, which under the current fiscal \nregime is not sustainable. \n \n3.  Technical constraints are a limiting factor in evacuation and dispersal of generated \npower to the end customers. Transmission and distribution losses for the national system stand \nat a quarter of net generation as the power supply chain is over-loaded, under-invested, and \nunder-maintained. For 2006-07, every 1% reduction in technical losses would have brought \nadditional revenue of some PRs4.3 billion (US$68 million) into the system at prevailing tariffs. \n \nII.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n4.  The fiscal issues are a primary cause of sector deterioration, and its severity is also \nnegatively  affecting  the  overall  fiscal  position  of  the  national  budget.  The  power  subsidy \npayments budgeted and to be paid by the Government, have reached unsustainable levels due \nto sharp increase in the international oil prices. This is accentuated as Pakistan\u2019s domestic \nproduction, catering for 25% of country\u2019s needs, is also linked to the international oil prices. \nConsequently, the power sector subsidies, the differential between the National Electric Power \nRegulatory Authority determined and Government notified tariff, has grown substantially by \nmore than 400% (from the budgeted PRs25 billion to actual PRs133 billion) during FY2008, \nprimarily  by  high  fuel price  for  thermal  generation.  The  delayed  subsidy  payments  by  the \nGovernment  has  led  to  insufficient  capital  (cash)  in  the  power  sector,  making  the  power \ndistribution companies (DISCOs) unable to pay their liabilities including purchase of electricity \nas well as limiting maintenance, augmentation, and expansion funding. This cash shortfall has \nspilled into power generation companies, rendering them unable to pay for the fuel deliveries. \nThe next link\u2500oil/gas producers\u2500are being partially paid by the fuel distribution companies. As a \n ", "66  Appendix 6 \nresult, a serious circular debt problem has emerged between the power utilities, fuel suppliers \nand the engineering industry. \n \n5.  This circular debt situation has created acute liquidity crisis as well as deterioration in \nfuel stock levels. This has been continuing over the past few years resulting in a serious debt \noverhang of PRs220 billion as of end FY2007 between the DISCOs and the Central Power \nPurchasing Agency (CPPA) of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Ltd (NTDC). It \nis estimated that the debt overhang has now swelled further during FY2008. Weak governance \nhas resulted in inefficient utility operations, power theft, illegal power supply, reduced billing and \ncollection, and non-payment of arrears. Financial sustainability can only be achieved once tariff \nis rationalized, subsidies are phased out and balance sheets of the entities are cleaned. Poor \nbusiness practices have contributed to the build up of the financial crisis which has significant \nrepercussions on the country's economy. Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) is \nat the center of a public sector circular debt problem, in which state firms and government \nministries have failed to pay power bills, while WAPDA has failed to meet obligations to them \nand to private sector creditors. \n \n6.  Since  1992,  Pakistan  has  undertaken  power  sector  restructuring.  The  objectives  of \nsector reforms are yet to be fully achieved: (i) private investment has been attracted into the \ngeneration sub-sector but after a high in the mid-l990s, there has been a persistent low in recent \nyears (Karachi Electric Supply Company\u2019s privatization has not borne results yet and the ex- \nWAPDA DISCOs are yet to be privatized), (ii) quality of service to the end-user has been \ncompromised significantly by power shortages (during peak demand summer months, power \nriots have been witnessed) and by over-loading of the transmission and distribution networks, \n(iii) sector financial strength has not been achieved and instead of being a net contributor to the \nnational treasury, the sector creates a fiscal burden to the tune of $2 billion/year. The successful \nimplementation of reforms becomes even more important as the Government seeks to attract \nlarge  private  sector  participation  in  developing  and  funding  the  current  and  future  power \ngeneration and system requirements in Pakistan. The reform agenda clearly has some way to \ngo. The immediate steps include corporate autonomy and sector governance, electricity trading, \nand financial management, among others. \n \n7.  Therefore ADB\u2019s assistance should address the fiscal sector imbalances as the first \npriority to ensure sufficient liquidity in the sector and to curtail the current circular debt issues. It \nis essential to determine the actual amount of the debt overhang, isolate it, and develop a \npractical  debt  restructuring  plan  acceptable  to  all  stakeholders.  It  is  expected  that  an \nimplementation of the debt restructuring plan would span several years.  Parallel to addressing \nthe  fiscal  aspects,  the  current  technical  short-comings  need  to  be  aggressively  tackled. \nCurrently the Government is moving rapidly trying to address the short-term generation crisis, \nand ensuring sufficient funding for NTDC and the DISCOs for improvements in the transmission \nand distribution systems. There are needs in terms of knowledge products and financing of \nbasically all technical areas of the power sector, but most importantly the Government need to \nensure that the fiscal energy sector matters are appropriately addressed to eliminate substantial \nenergy sector subsidy requirements. \n \n8.  Energy security is becoming a major concern globally, second to food security. This is \nclearly recognized by the country\u2019s Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF). The sector \nremains  institutionally  fragmented,  lacks  integrated  energy  planning  to  analyze/develop  a \nconsolidated action plan and address the country\u2019s energy needs in short, medium and long \nterm. The sector is managed by the Ministries of Petroleum & Natural Resources, Water & \nPower, Planning & Development, Environment, Transport and Communications, and Pakistan \n ", "Appendix 6  67 \nAtomic Energy Commission. There are separate regulatory bodies for oil & gas and electric \npower. No single ministry or regulatory body has over-arching responsibility and accountability \nfor energy. \n \n9.  An  integrated  model  interlinking  the  different  components  of  the  energy  chain  is \nnecessary for effective analysis and evaluation of the different options. Such a model will show \nwhether the current practice of transporting imported oil upcountry for power plants after adding \nthe economic cost of transportation, i.e. the impact on the overstretched road infrastructure is a \nlower cost option than building the power plants at the port and transmitting bulk power at high \nvoltage. Similarly it would help the country\u2019s economic managers in allocating scarce resources \nsuch as natural gas or answer questions being raised on subsidizing Compressed Natural Gas \n(CNG) as replacement for gasoline and its impact on refinery economics and the government\u2019s \nbudget. Given the strong link between the petroleum and the power sub-sectors the pricing \nregime  of  petroleum  products  impacts  the  cost  of  power  and  the  different  subsidies  and \nconcession the Government provides to consumers for social considerations or for the industry \nto maintain its competitiveness. Industry in Pakistan is currently disadvantaged, compared to its \ncounterpart in other countries, by the energy tariffs which have built in cross subsidies from the \nindustrial to domestic and agricultural consumers. \n \n10.  An integrated look will help develop a least cost approach to energy policy and pricing \nand minimize the cost of subsidies. Once true economic costs and benefits are established, \nissues such as pricing of peak power or using captive power can be effectively addressed. The \nviability of alternate energy and premium, if any, that the country should pay for diversifying \nsources to reduce supply risk, can be rationalized. An empowered and effective link between \nthe  planners  and  those  who  implement  these  plans  will  ensure  improved  information  for \ndecision making, realistic planning and faster implementation of projects. It should lead to faster \nand timely response to changes in domestic and geopolitical realities. The country needs to \nstart thinking in terms of energy rather than gas, oil, coal and electricity. This is necessary to \nmake  the  MTDF  and  Vision  2030  goal  of  Energy  Security,  which  means  ensured  energy \navailability at lowest possible cost, a reality. \n \n11.  Under Pakistan Accelerated Economic Transformation Program, ADB\u2019s assistance will \nfocus on addressing the fiscal imbalances in the power sector, complemented by integrated \nplanning approach to the sector, which ADB is assisting through an under implementation \nAdvisory Technical Assistance.  \n \nIII.  Program Components related to the Energy Sector \n \n12.  Following extensive discussions with the Government it was mutually agreed that the \nProgram would address the major fiscal areas related to the power sector. These specific areas \nincorporated in subprogram 1 include: \n \n\u2022  Parliamentary  approval  obtained  to  reduce  electricity  subsidies  through: \n(i) elimination of generalized sales tax subsidies for all domestic consumers and up \nto 500 units for commercial consumers; (ii) introduction of automatic monthly fuel \nprice  adjustments  through  a  surcharge;  and  (iii)  introduction  of  an  additional \nsurcharge to be levied on all consumers to reduce the gap between determined and \nnotified tariffs. \n\u2022  Work on estimation of power sector debt overhang and circular debt initiated. \n ", "68  Appendix 6 \n\u2022  All past electricity subsidy payments (PRs133 billion for FY2008) fully settled, and \nPRs88  billion  allocated  in  the  FY2009  budget  to  partially  cover  the  difference \nbetween determined and notified tariffs [for FY 2009]. \n \n13.  The component focuses on actual payments of funds and timing of cash flows, ensuring \nthat power sector remains liquid to pay its current obligations and invest in system maintenance, \nexpansion and augmentation. This is true for the current portion of the subsidy payments and \nthe immediate future requirements. Furthermore, the approach establishes the actual amounts \nof  the  circular  debt  and  debt  overhang.  After  the  amounts  have  been  established,  the \nGovernment is in a position to address subsequent financial issues and undertake least cost \nsystem expansion through an integrated energy planning. \n \nIV.  Outcome of the Energy Sector Components \n \n14.  The objectives in terms of ADB\u2019s energy sector components in the Program are (i) to \ntransparently  establish  the  subsidy  requirements  arising  from  current  subsidy  policies  and \ndecisions and ensure that these requirements are fully funded through national budget and duly \npaid  to  respective  agencies/companies,  and  (ii)  establish  the  non-sustainability  of  subsidy \nrequirements and subsequently move towards automatic fuel cost pass-through mechanisms on \na timely basis, wherein tariff levels closely matching the actual cost of supply, and focus on \nlimited and targeted subsidies. The policy dialog with Government related to both the objectives \nhas been positive in achieving these objectives. The Government has already initiated requisite \nsteps in the right direction including provision of adequate subsidies, measures to rationalize \ntariffs and move towards monthly adjustment of tariffs through the recently approved Finance \nBill 2008.   \n \n15.  In terms of direct outcome, it is expected that all subsidies would be paid by MOF to the \nDISCOs, leading to a healthy liquidity position in DISCOs to allow them to fully pay for the \nelectricity purchases from CPPA/NTDC. In turn, this would make CPPA capable of fulfilling its \nfinancial obligations with the generation companies, who again would be able to settle with the \nfuel suppliers. The short to medium term result would be the elimination of the circular debt. \nMore important the power generating companies will be able to procure sufficient fuel stocks to \nrun the plants at their maximum levels, which would increase supply by at least 1500 MW. \n \n16.  The success in attracting private investment to a certain extent depends on financial \nstrength of the contracting public sector. Fully addressing both the circular debt position and the \ndebt overhang issue would result in an increased attractiveness by potential buyers of energy \nsector  companies.  The  current  account  deficit  could  be  reduced  by  increased  FDI,  and \nprivatization of energy sector companies, both in the power and gas sub-sectors, would be a \ngood source of funds provided the fiscal position is made transparent and sustainable. The \nexpected outcome is fiscal neutrality within the energy sector, which would lead to increased \nability  of  the  Government  to  present  additional  energy  sector  entities  to  the  market  and \nincreased interest from potential investors to purchase these entities. It is also expected that the \nprice obtained for the entities would increase from the elimination of the circular debt and actual \ntimely subsidy payments by MOF. \n \nV.  Continuation of the Energy Sector Components \n \n17.  In the past the Government has been able to address fiscal deficits and imbalances in \nthe energy sector, through interventions and assistance of multilateral institutions. This positive \nexperience leads to a continued focus on these two areas dealing with continuous payment of \n ", "Appendix 6  69 \nsubsidies, as required, and make adequate allocations in future national budgets. Accordingly, \nthese two actions are imbedded in subsequent subprograms to ensure continuation of fiscal \ndiscipline and subsequent tranches would not be released without complying by these two \ndisbursement requirements. \n \n18.  In  terms  of  the  debt  overhang,  a  debt  restructuring  plan  must  be  developed  and \nimplemented  through  the  Program  period.  By  the  consideration  of  subprogram  2  the  debt \nrestructuring  plan  should  be  approved  and  implementation  should  have  started.  By \nconsideration of subprogram 3 it is expected that implementation of the debt restructuring plan \nis well underway towards closure. \n \n19.  To address the current technical shortcomings in the sector, the Government would be \nrequired to contract for electricity supply from new generation stations running on fuel oil. By \nsubprogram 2 the Government should have undertaken the calculations of the future subsidy \nrequirements taking into account the current tariff and subsidy policies, and arrive at its impacts \non  the  national  economy.  ADB  remains  Pakistan's  largest  development  partner  in  Energy \nSector  and  has  strong  presence  (through  investment  projects  and  analytical  and  project \npreparatory assistance) across the power supply chain in the country. ADB is simultaneously \naddressing the sector inefficiencies and remains committed to address sector inefficiencies. \n \n \n ", "70  Appendix 7 \nADB PROJECTS IN AREAS RELATED TO AETP AGENDA 1995-2008 \n \nTable 1.

The Government and the ADB program team have identified TA needs in two areas. The \nfollowing paragraphs present the coverage of issues, which may be further elaborated and \nrefined prior to or during the implementation of the TA. \n \n3.  Structural Transformation \u2013 Paving way for Medium-term Reforms: As outlined in \nthe main text of the RRP, the technical work on structural transformation will be undertaken \nthrough an ongoing TA and a TA loan. The purpose of this component of the proposed TA is to \ncoordinate the formulation of structural transformation strategies, help the Government build \nconsensus amongst the relevant stakeholders, and to implement the strategy. Specifically, the \nTA  will  support  the  High  Level  Working  Group  and  help  maintain  reform  momentum  by \n(i) providing  policy  advice  during  deliberations  of  the  working  group,  (ii)  assisting  in  the \nformulation  of  reform  actions,  (iii)  facilitating  consensus  building  on  reform  measures, \n(iv) assisting in the roll out of the national structural transformation action plan, (v) assisting in \nthe design of sector-specific development programs, (vi) monitoring the implementation of these \nprograms, and (vii) providing recommendations on relevant issues such as how to promote \nstructural  transformation,  streamlining  business  processes  and  structures  of  government \nagencies, and moving away from regulation to promoting innovation in the industries. \n \n4.  Structural  Transformation  \u2013  Implementing  Immediate/Short-term  Reforms \n(Investment  Climate):  This  TA  component  will  help  the  Government  in  formulating  and \nimplementing a range of short-term measures critical to attracting investments, in parallel with \nthe longer-term structural transformation agenda. At this stage, the specific areas identified \ninclude: (i) streamlining of labor laws \u2013 under which labor experts will assist in scoping out the \n ", "Appendix 13  95 \n \nlegal amendments initiated by the Government to consolidate the disparate labor laws, and \nprovide  recommendations  on  future  steps  that  can  be  supported  under  AETP;  this  is  in \ncontinuation of the reform agenda initiated with ADB support under the Small and Medium \nEnterprise  Development  Program;  (ii)  identifying  tax-related  distortions  that  prevent  the \nformation of business or further expansion of existing ones, and helping with the formulation of \nappropriate  incentives;  and  (iii)  improving  the  tariff  policy,  based  on  past  (and  updated) \nassessments of the tariff bands and dispersions, and recommending measures to increase \nPakistan\u2019s competitiveness.   \n \n5.  Finance/Corporate  Sector  Development:  The  support  under  the  TA  will  focus  on \ncarrying  forward  the  agenda  identified  and  initiated  as  part  of  subprogram  1  of  AETP  on \nbanking, non-banking and corporate sector (with focus on holding companies or groups) fronts. \nInternational/national expertise will be mobilized on a needs-basis in any of the areas included \nin subprograms 1-3 of the policy matrix. In addition, consultants will also support in the design of \nmeasures  for  promoting  long-term  financing  in  Pakistan,  specifically  through  pension  and \ninsurance sector reforms, which may be included in future subprograms. \n \nIII.  Implementation Arrangements and Cost Estimates \n \n6.  It is estimated that 5-6 international experts and 6 national experts will be required with \nexpertise in the areas identified in Table A13.2. Their outline terms of reference are presented in \nSection  IV  below.  However,  depending  on  the  emerging  circumstances,  the  CWRD  team \nimplementing the TA will retain flexibility on the number and person-month allocations between \nthe categories as well as their tasks. All experts will be recruited on an individual basis, given \nthe  disparate  nature  of  the  tasks  involved,  and  the  possible  need  to  recruit  and  deploy \nconsultants at different points in time subject to reform traction. Table A13.3 presents the cost \nestimates and financing plan for the TA. \n \nTable A13.2: Technical Assistance Requirements \n \nAdvisory Needs for Design and Implementation of Reforms \n(Key Areas and Indicative Person-Months Requirements) \nKey Areas  International  National \n1.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency (EA) for the TA. MOF will \nfacilitate the work under Components 1 and 2, and help the consultants in the coordination of \ntechnical work with any of the concerned departments/agencies. Work under Component 3 will \nbe directly under the supervision of the concerned financial sector regulators. \n \n ", "96  Appendix 13 \n \n8.  As the overall purpose of the TA is to facilitate structural transformation, there is need \nfor: (i) increasing awareness amongst government officials and policy makers; (ii) improving \ncoordination between the federal and provincial governments, as the policy and institutional \njurisdiction is split between the two levels; and (iii) improving the interface between investors \nand corporates on the one hand and the government on the other. The TA will organize \nworkshops or special events/sessions targeted at selected industries. \n \nTable A13.3. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan for AETP TA \n \nItem  Total Cost \nA.

Outline Terms of Reference for the AETP Design and Implementation TA \n \n9.  The following terms of reference (TORs) have been formulated on the basis of the TA \nneeds assessment during AETP appraisal. Changes \u2013 both in coverage and expertise \u2013 may be \nnecessary during implementation. \n \n10.  Structural  Transformation:  This  component  will  be  partly  technical  and  design  of \nreform measures, but mostly implementation of the plan prepared as part of the ongoing studies \nbeing undertaken with the Government of Pakistan on structural transformation.  \n \n11.  Medium-term Transformation Agenda (broadly item 1.1 in Table A13.2): The ongoing \nTAs are likely to be completed by about March-April 2009. The most challenging part of the \nprocess will be the actual implementation of the recommendations of the two studies. The \nexperts under this component of the TA will work closely with the Planning Commission and \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  other  relevant  parties  (including  provincial  governments)  to  begin \nimplementation  the  transformation  agenda.  Specifically,  the  experts  who  will  work  on  an \nintermittent basis, will: \n \n(i)  work closely with the two advisory teams in the last stages of their work to come \nto speed on (preparing) the Action Plan, principally to provide peer-review type \nfeedback as well as to ensure that the actions are practical to implement in \nPakistan\u2019s context; \n ", "Appendix 13  97 \n \n(ii)  identify,  for  each  set  of  actions,  the  lead  and  supportive \nagencies/ministries/levels  of  governments,  that  need  to  be  in  charge  of \nimplementation, and build ownership; \n(iii)  develop a full fledged implementation chart, with clear indicators and milestones, \nto monitor and evaluate the action plan execution;  \n(iv)  develop a system of identifying blocks to smooth execution and informing the \nGovernment\u2019s senior management team to take immediate corrective actions; \n(v)  explain the benchmarking exercise done as part of the studies to all relevant \nstakeholders and build and sustain reform momentum for change; \n(vi)  organize consultative workshops or sessions with other countries/jurisdictions \nthat have gone through the transformation process, and to help continue the \ninterface (to learn from real and successful examples); \n(vii)  organize/facilitate/recommend  consultations  between  stakeholders  within \nPakistan to execute the action plan smoothly; \n(viii)  help  the  government  in  identifying  one  or  two  industries  (or  segments  of \nindustries) as pilots for full implementation of the action plan; design a system for \nusing the feedback for subsequent expansion of the transformation agenda; \n(ix)  help the government in identifying common,  generic constraints that prevent \nstructural transformation; group them into themes (e.g. labor/skills; taxes/tariffs; \ninfrastructure;  legal/regulatory)  and  help  the  government  prioritize  actions  to \ngradually dismantle the constraints; and   \n(x)  act as an effective interface between the original study teams, the Government \nand ADB to ensure that information flows smoothly, any problems are identified \nand  solutions  sought  in  a  collective  manner,  and  measures  put  in  place  to \naccelerate execution of the action plan. \n \n12.  Near-Term Transformation Agenda (items 1.2 and 1.3 of Table A13.2): Under this \nsub-component, 2 international and 2 national experts will be recruited to help the Government \naddress the immediate investment-climate related challenges facing Pakistan, which in turn \nwould pave way for the medium-term transformational reforms. The experts will: \n \n(i)  examine recent assessments done by the Government, and those by ADB and \nother  development  partners  on  the  key  challenges  affecting  the  investment \nclimate adversely, including labor market rigidities (e.g. exit barriers) and skills \nshortages, and tax and tariff distortions; \n(ii)  identify key priorities and specific reform measures, and sequence them for the \nGovernment\u2019s  attention  and  consideration;  establish  a  timeline  for \nimplementation (also with a view to providing specific measures/milestones that \nthe  Government  can  achieve  for  subprogram  2  of  AETP,  that  is  between \nSeptember 2008-June 2009, and beyond); \n(iii)  in the labor area, prepare a short report summarizing the reform principles the \nGovernment should aim to achieve, such as consolidating multiple laws and \nregulations, reducing regulatory arbitrage, and gradually eliminating distortions \nwhile providing specific incentives; \n(iv)  in the tax and tariff areas, assess recommendations put together already by \ninstitutions such as the Engineering Development Board of Pakistan, the various \nchambers of commerce and industry, and trade/industry associations/think tanks, \nand  prioritize  and  sequence  practical  and  least  distortionary  actions  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s considerations; and establish a timeline for implementation (in a \nmanner as in (ii) above); and \n ", "98  Appendix 13 \n \n(v)  evaluate  the  current  institutional  architecture  for  investment  approvals  and \nrecommend measures to streamline the policy-making, regulatory and business \nprocesses among commerce, trade, industries (and other relevant economic) \nministries, and the Board of Investment and other statutory bodies; essentially, \nexamine if Pakistan needs a plethora of agencies dealing with various issues, \nand how they can function better (including through reorganization/realignment \noptions)  to  promote  innovation  and  efficiency  (eventually  leading  to \ntransformation) \n \n13.  Financial/Corporate  Sector  Development  (item  2  of  Table  A13.2):  Under  this \ncomponent, ADB has ongoing engagement on the regulatory and supervisory fronts. The exact \nTA requirements are not clear at this stage, while the broad directions are evident. These \ninclude: need for adopting a legal/regulatory architecture for group companies (which may play \nan important role in structural transformation, while in some cases may stifle it as well through \nopaque  dealings  within  groups);  and  need  for  identifying  long-term  financing  sources  for \ncorporate growth, including by expanding pension and insurance coverage. The experts in this \narea will: \n \n(i)  help  the  government  and  the concerned  regulatory  agencies  (State  Bank  of \nPakistan; and Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan) to effectively \nroll-out and implement the architecture for consolidated supervision; \n(ii)  help  develop  the  policy,  institutional  and  regulatory  architecture  for  holding \ncompanies;  \n(iii)  identify reform measures to promote long-term sources of financing corporate \ngrowth in Pakistan, with focus on both demand and supply sides (including debt \ninstruments \u2013 specifically corporate bond market development; how the existing \nnational saving system can be revamped; development of contractual savings \ninstitutions); and \n(iv)  suggest institutional measures for promoting domestic currency infrastructure \nfinancing in Pakistan. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 14  99 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n                                     Country/ProgramTitle: Pakistan/Accelerating Economic Transformation Program \n \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nPolicy-Based  CWRD/CWGF \nModality:  Division: \n \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s second generation poverty reduction strategy (PRSP II) is built around seven pillars: (i) drivers of \neconomic growth and macroeconomic stability, (ii) crafting a competitive advantage, (iii) harnessing potential of the \npeople,  (iv)  financial  sector  deepening  and  economic  development,  (v)  provision  of  world  class  infrastructure, \n(vi) effective governance and management, and (vii) targeting the poor and the vulnerable. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy \nand Program for Pakistan similarly supports the Government\u2019s emphasis toward higher sustained growth. \n \nThe recent trends in global and regional poverty as well as Pakistan\u2019s own experience from the last PRSP suggest that \nrapid economic growth over a prolonged period is essential for poverty reduction. At the macro level, economic growth \nimplies greater availability of public resources to improve the quantity and quality of education, health and other \nservices. At the micro level, economic growth creates employment opportunities, increases the income of people and \ntherefore, reduces poverty. The proposed Program will help Pakistan achieve and sustain higher economic growth in \nthe medium term through a process of structural transformation. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nBetween 2000/01 and 2004/05, Government estimates suggest a significant decline in the incidence of poverty in the \ncountry.1 The proportion of population living below the poverty line fell sharply from 34.5% in 2000/01 to 23.9% in \n2004/05,2 with approximately 13 million people moving out of poverty. This happened at the back of Pakistan\u2019s strong \neconomic growth which accelerated from 3.1% during 2001/02 to 4.7% the next year, and onto an average of 8.1% \nduring 2003/04 and 2004/05. The steep decline in poverty of over 10 percentage points in four years actually more \nthan offset the sharp rise in poverty during 1997-2001 when overall poverty increased by 8.7 percentage points as \nGDP was growing only by a modest 3.3% per annum on average. Notwithstanding this development, around 36.45 \nmillion people in Pakistan still live below the poverty line. Moreover, the incidence of poverty in 2004/05, using a longer \ntime horizon, was not much different than the level of poverty of 25.5% recorded in 1992/93. Poverty appears to have \ncome full circle in Pakistan. In the immediate to short-run, the challenge is to maintain the hard won improvement in \npoverty levels and even improve upon it through sustained growth in the range of 6-8 percent per annum.  \n \nTo sustain high rate of growth, Pakistan needs to, among others, address immediate distortions in the economy, \nparticularly in the agriculture and energy sectors. The pricing and procurement system for wheat needs to be \nrestructured, and subsidies better targeted to benefit the poor and vulnerable. The poorly targeted subsidies cost the \nGovernment PRs40 billion ($600 million) in FY2008, not including the additional resource requirements \u2013 estimated \nupwards of $1.6 billion at a minimum - to cushion the poor against the escalating prices. Pakistan also needs to fix its \nsubsidy system in the electricity sector. In the absence of an automatic adjustment mechanism, the Government has \nnot been able to settle the payments owed to distribution companies, which has resulted in a vicious circular debt \nproblem and debt overhang in the sector. This problem needs to be addressed urgently to resolve the present energy \ncrisis facing Pakistan. The immediate resource requirements are upwards of $2.5 billion.   \n \nHousehold expenditure surveys indicate the average share of food in total expenditures is inversely related to income \nlevels. A sharp rise in food price can have a devastating effect on the poor. In Pakistan, food prices have gone up by \nmore than 20% in the first quarter of 2008. ADB\u2019s analysis3 shows that a 10% increase in food prices can throw an \nadditional 7 million into poverty in Pakistan, a 20% increase 14.7 million and a 30% increase an additional 22 million. \nWhile energy prices have also gone up by about 30% in the first quarter, the rise in poverty incidence is estimated to \nbe much smaller of about 1.5 percentage points. ADB\u2019s analysis also shows that, if every poor person were to be \ncompensated to offset the loss in real expenditure, the Government may incur between PRs18.5 billion (0.3% of GDP) \n                                                 \n1  The poverty line is based on a threshold of 2350 calories per adult equivalent per day, using the calorific approach for estimation. \n2  The latest Government estimates suggest that there has been a further decline in the incidence of poverty to 22.3% in 2005/06.  \n3  ADB.

Design Features \nThe Program\u2019s pro-poor design includes measures to (i) expand the social safety net and make it more efficient to \nprotect the poor and vulnerable from the adverse impact of recent global developments, and (ii) adopt structural \nreforms to address inefficiencies in the agricultural sector, particularly with respect to wheat markets and food security \npolicies. (The poor and vulnerable are found to be affected most by a hike in wheat price.) Specific interventions are \ndiscussed in detail below. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) to the country and major groups affected. \n \nThe Program will provide significant benefits in general, and directed benefits for the poor in particular.  \n \n\u2022  First, it will help meet the immediate and massive fiscal needs of the Government. At a minimum, the agriculture \nand energy subsidies need to be met at a cost of upwards of $3 billion.  \n\u2022  Second, the Government needs to move away from the inefficient and untargeted subsidies to a targeted safety \nnet program for the poor. Beginning with about 2 million households, the Program will help target up to about 5 \nmillion households, or roughly about one-fourth of the poor who are likely to be directly affected by the spiraling \nfood inflation. \n\u2022  Third, the Program will open the way for structural transformation. \n\u2022  Fourth, the Program will help cut the transaction costs for businesses (reductions in red tape in tax payments) \nand improve investment climate.  \n\u2022  Fifth, the Program will raise public confidence in the banking system arising from development of a financial \nsector safety net, including a depositor protection scheme, and stronger financial intermediaries that are better \nable to mobilize and allocate resources and risks, and promote financial sector stability. \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \nanalysis). \n \nThe appropriate direction of food security policy in the short-term should safeguard food availability and accessibility of \nthe poor and vulnerable. For farmer producers, a guaranteed minimum price (but indexed on both costs of production \nand the export parity level) may be needed to enable farmers to reap some of the economic gains of wheat price hikes. \nAs part of Subprogram (SP) 1, the Government has increased the supply price of wheat for farmers by more than 50% \nor 80% of the export parity price in early 2008. This is a good step towards market-based pricing, but there has to be \nan automatic adjustment process put in place, which will be pursued under subsequent subprograms. As part of \nsubprogram 1, the Government has lowered its wheat reserves to 3 months of national consumption requirements. \nThis is an important step, as the Government has never been able to procure more than 20% in the past. The higher \ntarget, despite being unrealistic, has exerted artificial pressures on the markets.  \n \nSpecific policies are needed to deal with the root causes and consequences of high energy prices. Although the current \npolitical economy and global landscape pose complex policy challenges, the Government has taken certain key actions \nunder  subprogram  1. These  include:  ensuring  up-to-date  payments  of  the  tariff  differential  subsidies  to  power \ndistribution companies (DISCOs), allocating sufficient resources for energy subsidies in the budget to meet the forecast \nneeds over FY2009, and determining the extent of circular debt and debt overhang in the electricity sector and ring-\nfencing the debt owed by DISCOs. The settlement of the past subsidies owed by the Government will cost $1.1 billion. \nAddressing the circular debt and debt overhang is likely to need another about $3-$3.5 billion over 2008-2010. \n \nAnother achievement of subprogram 1 is to enhance awareness of the need to move from the poorly targeted and \ninefficient subsidies in the food and energy sectors to a more targeted safety net system. The Government has set \naside resources in the FY2009 budget to provide cash transfers and food support for about 5 million poor and \nvulnerable households in a targeted manner. Means-tested cash transfer programs have been developed. Ultimately, \nthe Government aims to expand the safety net cover over the next 2-3 years. \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n \nPoverty levels in Pakistan fluctuated a great deal during the last one and a half decade, with the fluctuation generally \nassociated with the economic growth performance of the country. The Program aims to help Pakistan achieve and \nsustain higher economic growth of about 8% on average per year from 2012-2020, through a process of structural \ntransformation of the country\u2019s economy. The Program will provide the fiscal and implementation support needed to \nundertake and leverage reforms. With the observed macro level poverty-growth correlation, this sustained high \neconomic growth is expected to contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nThe challenge of poverty alleviation still remains huge. Pakistan, being a signatory to the Millennium Development \n ", "Appendix 14  101 \nGoals (MDGs), is committed to achieving the MDG target for poverty by halving the level of poverty incidence between \n1990 and 2015. The estimated level of poverty in 1990 in Pakistan was 26%. This needs to go down to 13% by 2015 if \nthe target is to be met. With the present poverty level of 24%, there is clearly still a long way to go. The poverty \nproblem, therefore, is not about to be immediately eliminated and will require sustained efforts. Continued and \nconsistent pursuit of pro-poor growth policies, along with accompanying investments and a focus on the effectiveness \nof investment spending, and forging long-term and constructive partnerships with the private sector, civil society and \ndevelopment institutions, will be key to ensuring the long term success of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \nand programs.    \n \nThe proposed Program is premised on three key principles. First, Pakistan needs to address certain economic \ndistortions in the short-term, specifically by reorienting inefficient subsidies and targeting them to benefit the poor and \nvulnerable. Second, Pakistan needs to diversify its economy and increase the share of industry from the current level \nof 25% of GDP and particularly increase the share of high value added manufacturing. In parallel, it needs to increase \nagriculture productivity and make its service sector produce greater value. Third, Pakistan needs to deepen financial \nintermediation and increase financial sector stability and soundness. \n \nThere can be no presumption that structural transformation of an economy of the size and nature such as Pakistan\u2019s \ncan happen in a short-span of time, or through rigidly prescribed conditionalities. To achieve the principles laid out \nabove, the Program sets out a 4-5 year design and implementation period, and a cluster structure that provides \nflexibility to meet evolving circumstances. It sets out short and medium-term actions, with changes to come beyond the \n5-year period. The Program will only tackle the more tangible issues, with a large number of procedural and process \nrelated changes taking place in parallel to the proposed reform measures.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nAmong the most pressing crises facing the Government is the rising food prices, especially the main staple, wheat. A \nconfluence of global factors resulted to this phenomenon: high food demand and changing food consumption patterns, \nincreasing energy prices which encourage shift in production land use from food to alternative biofuel, increased land \ncultivation for feeds, and structural neglect for agriculture investments.  \n \nPakistan experienced a 20% increase in wheat prices between November 2007 and February 2008. In November \n2007, the Federal Bureau of Statistics reported that food and beverage prices had risen by 14.7% from October 2006 \nto October 2007. The poorest segments of the population are particularly hard hit by the increases in food prices. Long \nqueues have formed at government stores and wheat ration cards have been reinstituted. Violent protests have also \nerupted in the country. While high food prices hurt poor consumers, they are expected to help poor farmers: however, \nthis depends critically on whether farmers can get access to needed fertilizer, irrigation, and markets. \n \nHalf of Pakistan's population is considered to be \"food insecure,\" according to the World Food Programme. Food \nsecurity as defined in the World Food Summit (Rome 1996) is a situation \u201cwhen all people, at all times have physical \nand economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food and to meet their dietary needs and food preference of an \nactive and healthy life.\u201d Food security is measured in terms of (i) physical access to food (or availability), economic \naccess to food, and biological utilization of food (food absorption). Many studies note that in Pakistan, physical \navailability of food (including wheat flour) may not be the main issue, but rather consumers are constrained by poverty \nor their low income that in turn, impedes their ability to use the food adequately for a balanced proper nutrition.  \n \nPakistan has set up a range of schemes to help the poor, with many based on targeting. The Government has also \ndevoted significant efforts to expand microfinance outreach. The existing schemes, however, suffer from four key \nproblems:  weak design (including  poor  eligibility criteria), poor  implementation, risk of elite capture, and  weak \nmonitoring and evaluation. Further, the scale of the needs and challenges facing Pakistan now are quite significant, \ncalling for a robust safety net scheme that is based on strong data and criteria. \n \nThe Program will assist the Government in ensuring food availability and access of wheat flour especially for the poor \nand vulnerable groups. Key agenda for action include: (i) establishing a more cost-effective and market-oriented \nreserve stock management system, and (ii) developing and implementing a means-tested cash transfer and food \nsafety net program. \n \nIn the medium-term, food security cannot be sustained through provision of consumer and producer subsidies. \nMeasures that enhance economic activities and job creation would be a more sustainable basis for the poor to cope \nwith food price spikes. Further, higher productivity of the food producing sector and its integration to a more efficient \nand effective integration of the food supply chain are required instead of distortionary price supports. Specifically, \nfarmers need to be equipped with access to (i) high yielding seed varieties, modern technology and agronomic \npractices and secured water supply and land use rights; as well as (ii) access to accurate information on market \nconditions, market infrastructure, and institutional arrangements that effectively link them to the domestic and global \nmarket. With these, the farmers can make the right choices and to realize profits from evolving global trading system. \n ", "102  Appendix 14 \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.
