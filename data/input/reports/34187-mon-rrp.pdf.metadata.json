The  Project  has \nthree \ncomponents:  (i)  developing  a  national  curriculum  framework  and \naligned  education  standards,  (ii)  improving  teaching  and  learning \nenvironments  in  primary  and  secondary  schools,  and  (iii)  promoting \ndemand-driven vocational education for the youth.  \n \nKey  issues  in  the  current  Mongolian  education  system  are  (i)  poor \nquality  and  relevance  of  the  current  curriculum  for  primary  and \nsecondary  education,  (ii)  inadequate  teaching  qualifications  and  skills, \n(iii)  lack  of  consistent  education  standards,  (iv)  weak  learning  and \nteaching  environments  in  schools,  and  (v)  supply-driven  irrelevant \nvocational education for youth. The Government has decided to extend \nthe  education  system  from  the  current  10-year  system  to  a  12-year \nsystem  in  2008,  which  will  align  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  with \ninternational standards. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will assist \nthe Government in the implementation of this policy, which will require \ncomprehensive  reform  of  the  curriculum  framework,  establishing  new \neducation standards, streamlining the current teacher in-service training \nsystem, and developing a national teacher accreditation system.  \n \nThe  limited  capacity  and  poor  condition  of  school  facilities\u2014which \ncontinue  to  deteriorate\u2014are  major  constraints  to  increasing  enrolment \nand retention, and improving the quality of education services. This has \nbeen particularly acute in rural areas where budget funds for preventive \nmaintenance  and  technical  resources  for  rehabilitation  are  scarce. \nBuilding  construction  and  technology  are  inefficient  in  terms  of  use  of \nmaterials, structural capacity, and energy performance.  \n \n\n\fis \n\ntraining  equipment \n\nlacking  or  outdated,  and \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science  (MECS)  is  the  sole \npublic  sector  provider  of  vocational  and  technical  education  (VTE)  for \nthe  youth.  Currently,  vocational  education  programs  are  based  on  the \nformer  Soviet  system,  which  is  neither  responsive  to  labor  market \ndemands  nor  cost-effective.  Graduates  have  difficulty  finding  jobs \nbecause they lack employable skills. School facilities have deteriorated, \nadequate \nthe \npedagogical  and  technical  skills  and  knowledge  of  many  teachers  are \noutdated. With the introduction of the 12-year school system, the VTE \nsystem  will  need  to  be  adjusted  to  the  new  national  curriculum \nframework. \n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  education  sector  in  Mongolia  has  evolved \nsince  the  early  1990s  to  support  the  Government  in  strengthening  the \neducation  system  step-by-step.  ESDP  was  approved  in  1996  and \nincluded  a  program  loan  to  support  fundamental  policy  reforms  in  the \norganization,  management,  staffing,  and  financing  of  the  education \nsector;  and  a  project  loan  to  support  initial  investments.  SEDP  was \napproved in 2002 and builds on the initial reform framework established \nby  ESDP,  with  a  focus  on  school  and  kindergarten  rehabilitation, \nprovision  of  learning  materials,  and  limited  support  in  curriculum \ndevelopment  and  teacher  training.  The  Project  focuses  on  two  major \nfeatures which have not been addressed by previous interventions: (i) a \ncomprehensive  curriculum  reform,  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s \ndecision  to  extend  the  schooling  period  by  2  years;  and  (ii)  reforming \nthe  current  VTE  system,  which  is  a  development  priority  of  the \nGovernment to enhance employment and income-earning opportunities \nand  promote  economic  growth.  The  Project  contributes \ntwo \n(i)  achieving  universal  primary \nMillennium  Development  Goals: \neducation,  and  (ii)  eliminating  gender  disparity \nin  primary  and \nsecondary education. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  employability  and  income-\nearning  opportunities  of  graduates  from  secondary  and  vocational \neducation.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced  and  more \nequitable access to\u2014and improved quality and relevance of\u2014primary, \nsecondary, and vocational education. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $16.38  million  equivalent.  The \nforeign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $3.83  million  (24%  of  the  total \ncost)  and  the  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $12.55  million \nequivalent (76% of the total cost). \n \n\nto \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nv\n\n79.4 \n\n20.6 \n100 \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development \nBank \nGovernment of \nMongolia \nTotal \n\n($ \u2018000) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nTotal \n\nPercent \n\n9,170 \n\n3,830 \n\n13,000 \n\n3,378 \n12,548 \n\n0 \n3,830 \n\n3,378 \n16,378 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTo  further  support  project  activities,  Germany  German  Agency  for \nTechnical Cooperation [GTZ] has indicated that it will provide additional \nconsulting  inputs  of  $0.60  million  on  a  grant  basis,  and  the  United \nNations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  has  indicated  that  it  will  provide \nconsultancy inputs of $0.09 million on a grant basis.  \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  8,794,000  Special  Drawing  Rights  ($13 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance \n79.4%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  Interest  will  be  charged  at \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n\n30 March 2012 \n \n31 September 2011 \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nMinistry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) \n \nThe project steering committee (PSC) established under SEDP will be \nreorganized  and  will  consist  of  eight  members\u2014two  representatives \nfrom  MECS,  one  from  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Welfare,  and  two \nfrom  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy;  and  one  each \nfrom \nnongovernment organizations, industry, and development partners. The \nchairman will be appointed by the minister of education and will be the \nproject  director.  The  PSC  will  provide  strategic  guidance,  monitor \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  and  ensure  donor  coordination.  The \nproject  director  will  coordinate  overall  implementation  of  project \nactivities.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  current  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) established under ESDP, staffed by a project \nmanager and five additional staff, who will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation of activities. MECS will provide office space for the PIU. \nThe  PIU  will  report  to  the  project  director  and  provide  quarterly  result-\nbased progress reports to the PSC, MECS management, and ADB.  \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith  its  Procurement  Guidelines.  Procurement  of  civil  works  will  be \ncarried  out  through  national  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  of \nequipment will be performed through international competitive bidding, \nand national competitive bidding satisfactory to ADB, and shopping. \n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nteacher \n\nA  total  of  8  person-months  of  international  and  265  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services will be contracted under loan funds. This \nwill  include  experts  in  the  field  of  policy  development,  curriculum  and \nstandards  development, \ntraining,  and  civil  engineers \nspecialized  in  school  rehabilitation.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  In \naddition,  Germany  [GTZ]  is  expected  to  provide  grant  assistance  for \n40 person-months of international consultants and UNICEF is expected \nto  finance  6  person-months  of  international  and  4  person-months  of \nnational consultants. \n \nDirect  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  include  all  students  enrolled  in \nprimary and secondary schools. Nationwide, about 560,000 students\u2014\nincluding  about  201,000  students  from  poor  families\u2014will  benefit  from \nimproved  curriculum,  well-defined  education  standards,  and  enhanced \nassessment  systems.  About  31,000  students  and  1,200  teachers  will \nbenefit from improved school and dormitory facilities in 45 schools to be \nrehabilitated under the Project. In addition, about 23,000 students and \n900 teachers of 30 model schools will benefit from upgraded teaching \nfacilities.  Rehabilitation  works  will  contribute  to  reduce  the  cost  of \nutilities and operation and maintenance (O&M). About 21,400 teachers \nthroughout  the  country  will  benefit  from  in-service  teacher  training \nprograms.  \n  \nAbout  21,900  students  of  vocational  education  institutions  will  benefit \nfrom  reform  of  the  VTE  system  and  a  new  demand-driven  curriculum, \nwhich will improve their employment and income-earning opportunities \nafter  graduation.  Student  and  teachers  of  six  key  VTE  institutions  will \nbenefit  from  rehabilitated  facilities  and  modern  training  equipment. \nIndustries and services will benefit from improvements in relevance and \nquality  of  VTE.  Graduates  of  VTE  institutions  entering  the  labor  force \nwill  possess  knowledge  and  skills  in  line  with  industry  requirements, \ncontribute to higher labor productivity, and increase economic growth. \n \nSuccessful implementation of the Project rests on the assumption that \nthe  Government  will  (i)  maintain  the  high level  of  budget allocation  for \nthe education sector; (ii) be committed to improve donor coordination to \nstrengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of education \nservices;  (iii)  maintain  its  commitment  to  carry  out  education  reforms, \nincluding  national  curriculum  reform;  (iv)  provide  adequate  budget  to \nprovide in-service training for all teachers employed by the system; and \n(v)  reform  and  rationalize  the  current  VTE  system.  To  achieve  its \nimpact,  the  Project  assumes  that  further  steady  economic  growth  will \ncreate new job opportunities. \n \nThe  managerial  and  technical  capacity  of  MECS  is  limited  and  might \naffect the smooth implementation of the extension of the school system \nto  a  12-year  system  and  the  introduction  of  the  new  curriculum \nframework nationwide. The  risks  will  be mitigated through training and \n\n\f \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nvii\n\ncapacity  building  under  the  Project.  The  policy  impact  of  introducing \nnew  education  standards  and  uniform  assessments  will  be  significant. \nRisks  include  resistance  from  teachers  and  school  directors  to  accept \nchanges  to  implement  the  new  curriculum  framework  and  introduce \nuniform  examinations.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  adopting  a \nparticipatory  approach  to  project  implementation,  actively  involving \nschool  directors,  teachers,  and  communities.  Financial  risks  involve \npotential  difficulties  in  the  provision  of  incremental  recurrent  costs  for \nO&M  of  rehabilitated  schools.  To  mitigate  the  risk,  ADB  will  work \nclosely  with  the  Government  to  ensure  that  adequate  resources  are \nallocated  for  the  education  sector,  incremental  recurrent  costs  are \nassigned for O&M, and appropriate assurances are included. \n \nADB  will  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  MECS\u2019 \ntechnical  and  management  capacity  in  strategic  planning  and  policy \nanalysis,  and  enable  the  ministry  to  set  up  a  sector  wide  approach  in \nthe education sector. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $210,000 \nequivalent,  of  which  $55,000  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$155,000 equivalent the local currency cost.

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia  for  the  Third  Education  Development  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Development  of  a  Sector  Wide  Approach  in  Education,  and  if  the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn 2002, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide TA to \nassist  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science  (MECS)  to  prepare  the  Third  Education \nDevelopment Project (the Project)1 as a follow-up to the ongoing Second Education Development \nProject  (SEDP)2  and  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP)3  that  was  successfully \ncompleted  in  2002.  The  Government  considers  improving  the  quality  of  the  education  system, \nenhancing access to basic education services, and promoting demand-driven vocational education \nto  be  key  instruments  to  alleviate  poverty,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and  reduce  disparities  in \nthe  development  process\u2014particularly  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  In  accordance  with \nGovernment\u2019s  development  strategy,  the  Project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram Update 2005\u20132006 and Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2006\u20132008.  4 The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n1. \n \n3. \nAfter  14  years  of  economic  transition,  Mongolia  stands  out  as  a  good  performer  among \ntransition  economies.  Profound  economic  reform  has  led  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the \npillars  of  a  market  economy  and,  at  present,  substantive  macroeconomic  stabilization  has  been \nachieved. However, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ($602 in 2004) has not yet reached \npre-transition  levels  and  poverty  has  emerged  as  an  unwelcome  side  effect  of  the  transition. \nPoverty spread on a large scale in the 1990s as a consequence of the structural transformation of \nthe economy. Following the collapse of the socialist institutions, a range of services deteriorated, \nincluding  health  care,  education,  transportation,  water  supply,  and  sanitation.  Poverty  remains \npersistent  in  both  rural  and  urban  Mongolia  and  36%  of  the  population  live  below  the  national \npoverty line ($0.75 a day). Continued growth is helping to lift living standards but the benefits are \nnot  distributed  equally  among  the  population,  as  revealed  by  income  inequality  and  unchanged \npoverty incidence. Rural poverty is significantly higher than urban poverty, with Western Mongolia \nstanding out as the most seriously affected region. Sectoral composition of GDP has changed, with \nindustry  and  services  expanding  fast  while  agriculture  has  declined.  This  has  led  to  a  significant \nmigration  flow  from  the  countryside  to  the  major  urban  centers,  which  has  caused  major \nimbalances  in  educational  service  provision.  A  total  of  57.4%  of  the  population  currently  lives  in \nurban centers. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n4. \nMongolia has a relatively young, economically active population. Of the total population of \nabout  2.5  million,  38%  are  below  the  age  of  16,  and  55%  are  of  working  age.  The  sharp  fall  in \naverage income that marked the first years of the transition triggered a drop in birth rate and the \npopulation\u2019s growth rate declined from 2.7% in 1989 to 0.8% in 2004. \n \nHigh  unemployment  (14.2%)  and  underemployment  caused  by  a  mismatch  between \n5. \navailable skills and labor market needs is one of the major causes of poverty. The service sector is \nthe  main  source  of  employment  in  Mongolia,  followed  by  agriculture  and  industry.  However,  the \npattern  is  completely  different  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  While  services  account  for  75%  of  the \nemployed in urban centers, they employ only 5% of the rural labor force, which is mainly engaged \nin livestock and farming activities. The lack of relevant knowledge and skills among poor migrants \nrestricts their earning opportunities to intermittent low-wage employment in the informal sector and \nis  a  major  cause  of  poverty  among  this  group.  The  recent  Household  Income  and  Expenditure \nSurvey  and  Living  Standards  Measurement  Survey5  found  that  the  poor  have  lower  education \nattainments  than  the  nonpoor  in  general;  and  lack  the  managerial,  professional,  or  technological \nskills required in burgeoning industries. The divide is particularly evident in urban areas where only \n14% of the poor possess skills in demand, compared with 38% of the nonpoor.  \n \n6. \nMongolia\u2019s  experience  suggests  that  economic  growth  does  not  translate  into  poverty \nreduction  immediately,  given  the  narrow  base  of  the  economy  and  its  vulnerability  to  external \nshocks. Hence, specific interventions are required to combat poverty. Education is perceived as an \nimportant vehicle to reduce poverty, upgrade human development, and generate job opportunities. \nImproving  the  quality  and  relevance  of  education\u2014both  in  urban  and  rural  areas\u2014is  essential  to \nstrengthen  the  country\u2019s  human  capital,  widen  the  range  of  opportunities  for  employment \ngeneration, and promote competitiveness and private sector development.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEducation Sector \n\n \nEducation  was  one  of  Mongolia\u2019s  main  achievements  in  the  socialist  era.  School  and \n7. \ndormitory  facilities  were  established  in  all  soums  (districts),  allowing  all  children\u2014including  those \nfrom  remote  nomadic  families\u2014to  obtain  a  basic  education.  Results  were  impressive.  The  gross \nenrolment  rate  (GER)  in  primary  and  secondary  education  reached  99%  by  1990.  This  was \naccompanied by high literacy rates which, even in 2004, stood at 97% of the population aged over \n15.  With  the  termination  of  financial  and  technical  support  from  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  the \nquality of and access to education services in Mongolia deteriorated. State education expenditures \nwere  massively  reduced.  Without  finance  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  essential \nrepairs,  school  facilities  deteriorated  and  many  were  forced  to  close.  Availability  of  learning \nmaterials  dwindled  and  teachers\u2019  real  salaries  eroded  distinctly.  By  1996,  the  GER  had  fallen  to \n82% and dropout rates6 had increased. A description of the education sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nRobust  planning  and  investments  by  the  Government\u2014and  major  support  from  ADB, \n8. \nGovernment of Japan, and other development partners over the last 10 years\u2014have reversed this \ndecline and resulted in improvements across the education sector, including (i) major policy reform; \n(ii)  rationalization  of  financing,  staff,  and  facilities;  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  a  large \nnumber of school facilities and classrooms. In the 2003\u20132004 school year, the GER increased to \n\n                                                 \n5  The survey was conducted by the National Statistical Office with assistance from the World Bank and United Nations \n\nDevelopment Programme in 2003\u20132004. \n\n6   This is defined by MECS as a pupil who has missed a year of school. Reasons behind student dropout vary. MECS \nhas  identified  the  following  key  reasons  behind  the  dropout  rate:  (i)  problems  with  income  and  the  affordability  of \neducation;  (ii)  migration  pressures,  i.e.  seeking  work  in  urban  areas;  and  (iii)  school-based  discrimination  against \nmigrant children. Other agencies have identified the cost of education in relation to poverty levels, city schools refusing \nto accept new enrolments, lack of interest in learning, and poor health as contributing reasons.  \n\n \n\n\f97%. In 2005, the Government decided to extend the current 10-year system to a 12-year system \nin 2008, which will align Mongolia\u2019s education system with international standards. \n \n9. \nThe  formal  education  system  in  Mongolia  consists  of  kindergarten  and  preschool  (up  to \nage 7),  primary  education  (4  years),  lower  secondary  education  (4  years),  and  upper  secondary \neducation (2 years). From the 2005\u20132006 school year, the Government extended the structure of \nschool  education  from  grades  1\u201310  (4+4+2)  to  grades  1\u201311  (5+4+2),  with  the  expectation  of \nexpanding  this  further  to  a  12-year  system  (6+3+3)  in  2008.  Basic  education  (primary  and  lower \nsecondary  education)  is  compulsory  and  funded  by  the  state.  In  2004\u20132005,  some  557,346 \nstudents  were  enrolled  in  710  primary  and  secondary  schools  with  a  total  of  21,458  teachers. \nMECS  is  the  central  administrative  body  that  formulates  national  educational  policy  and  sets  the \nstandards  for  each  level  of  formal  education.  MECS  also  administers  general  provisions  on \neducation  matters,  teacher  training,  curriculum  development,  and  state  examination  procedures, \nand is responsible for the accreditation of higher education institutions. \n \n10.  MECS  is  the  sole  public  sector  provider  of  vocational  and  technical  education  (VTE)  for \nyouth. Vocational and technical training and retraining for adults is offered by institutions under the \nMinistry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW), other line ministries, and the private sector. MECS \nadministers a total of 42 VTE institutions. There are 22 vocational education and training centers \n(VETCs) and vocational training and production centers (VTPCs), which offer a 2.5-year combined \nprofessional and general education, leading to a professional certificate and a secondary education \ncertificate. The entry level for VTPCs/VETCs is grade 8. The curriculum in VTPCs/VETCs retains \nlarge elements of the pre-transitional system. MECS also administers 14 branch schools (attached \nto  higher  education  institutions)  and  6  technical  colleges,  which  provide  advanced  technical \neducation  for  higher-level  skills  development,  leading  to  a  professional  diploma  or  bachelors \ndegree. In 2004\u20132005, 21,911 students were enrolled in VETCs, VTPCs, and branch schools. \n \n11.  Mongolia\u2019s education expenditure is among the highest of the transition countries at 7.3% \nof  GDP  or  18.5%  of  the  total  national  budget  in  2004.  Expenditure  on  primary  and  secondary \neducation  is  highest  among  the  subsectors,  at  48%  of  total  education  expenditure,  with \nkindergarten  (preschool)  education  at  17%,  VTE  at  4%,  higher  education7  at  19%,  and  other \nexpenditure8 at 12%. Of total expenditure on education in 2004, recurrent expenditure amounted to \n91.3%, capital expenditure 4.5%, and net lending (through the State Education and Training Fund) \n4.2%. \n \n12. \nDepending on the location of schools, between 70% and 90% of school budgets are spent \non  personnel  and  heating  costs.9  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  meet  salaries  and  heating \ncosts  will  continue  to  absorb  most  of  the  annual  budget  for  education.  Education  financing  is \nexpected to remain sufficient over the short to medium term to maintain the current status of the \neducation  system.10  However,  given  the  high  level  of  investment  needs  in  the  sector,  while \ngovernment  expenditure  is  expected  to  be  sufficient  to  cover  recurrent  expenditure  and \nincremental  O&M  costs,  it  is  unlikely  to  be  able  to  accommodate  further  increases  in  investment \n\n                                                 \n7  Including expenditure on student loans and grants through the State Education and Training Fund (SETF). \n8  Including  expenditure  on  MECS  itself,  aimag  (province)  education  and  culture  departments,  culture,  science,  and \n\nadditional sectoral investment. \n\n9  Of recurrent  expenditure for  primary  and secondary education  in  2004, the costs of  personnel (salaries, allowances, \nand insurance contributions) amounted to 64%; heating 17%; food 5%; electricity 2%; water supply, transport, and fuel \n2%;  current  renovation  (maintenance)  2%;  other  goods  and  services  7%;  and  subsidies  and  transfers  1%.  For \nvocational and technical education, the proportions were personnel 41%; heating 17%; food 7%; electricity 5%; water \nsupply,  transport,  and  fuel  3%;  current  renovation  (maintenance)  5%;  other  goods  and  services  21%;  and  subsidies \nand transfers 1%. \n\n10 Preliminary estimates of the Ministry of Finance and Economy indicate that education\u2019s share of GDP will rise to 8.2% \n\nin 2005, declining to 6.1% by 2008. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nspending  for  the  sector  which  are  essential  to  rehabilitate  school  facilities  and  finance  the \nmodernization of the education system. The Government will be dependent on external assistance \nto meet future challenges in strengthening and modernizing the education system. \n \n13. \nDespite  gains  over  the  past  decade,  the  affordability  of  education  continues  to  present \nchallenges  for  families,  in  particular  for  the  poor.  At  the  beginning  of  each  school  year,  families \nmust  meet  new  costs,  including  compulsory  school  uniforms,  textbooks,  a  range  of  unofficial \ncharges  made  by  schools  (including  enrolment  and/or  transfer  \"fees\"),  and  informal  incentive \npayments  for  teachers.  There  is  only  limited  capacity  within  most  communities  for  contributing  to \nthe urgently required rehabilitation and maintenance needs of schools. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Issues and Challenges \n\n14. \nNational  Curriculum  Framework  and  Revised  Education  Standards.  The  planned \nintroduction of a new 12-year education system will need to be supported by curriculum reform and \nthe  development  of  agreed  education  standards  for  each  subject  and  grade  level.  At  present,  a \nconsistent broad curriculum frame linked to educational standards is not in place. The extension of \nthe schooling period has not been reflected in recent curriculum revisions. The current education \ncurriculum  is  overloaded  with  subjects  and  content  requirements,  with  insufficient  emphasis  on \nmodern learning methodologies, and echoes learning arrangements of the socialist era, which are \nno longer consistent with the need for greater flexibility in subject selection and a student-centered \nteaching environment. MECS has started the process of revising education standards and a set of \nnew standards has been published. However, the new education standards have not yet taken into \naccount  the  need  to  modernize  the  curriculum  framework;  and  teachers,  parents,  and  textbook \nauthors find the standards too complex and difficult to translate into clear student competences. At \npresent, student examinations have little transparency due to lack of clear standards. Exams  are \nnot  prepared  according  to  uniform  national  standards  and  are  not  comparable  between  schools, \nwhich makes it difficult to monitor quality.  \n \n15. \nTeachers\u2019  Qualifications.  The  main  constraints  on  improving  educational  quality  are  the \nlack  of  a  (i)  comprehensive  teacher  in-service  training  system,  and  (ii)  national  teacher \naccreditation system. Currently, there is no agreed national teacher accreditation system in place. \nStudents  graduate  from  38  universities  and  colleges  with  different  levels  of  education.  Training \nprograms  at  these  universities  and  colleges  do  not  follow  agreed  national  standards.  School and \naimag (province) authorities are in charge of teacher recruitment and assessment. However, due \nto  the  lack  of  national  agreed  professional  standards  and  teacher  accreditation  schemes,  the \nknowledge and competence of new teachers vary from school to school.  \n \nThe  teaching  techniques  and  subject  knowledge  of  many  teachers  are  inadequate  and \n16. \noutdated  and  need  to  be  upgraded,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  The  shortage  of  qualified  English \nand vocational teachers is largely due to the inability of the education sector to compete with the \nprivate sector in employing personnel with these skills. Emphasis needs to be placed on improving \nteachers\u2019  working  conditions  and  upgrading  their  qualifications.  Currently,  in-service  teacher \ntraining  is  carried  out  by  22  Education  and  Culture  Departments  (ECDs)  at  aimag  level,  some \nuniversities and colleges, and donor supported projects. However, training programs do not follow \nnational standards, are not coordinated, and do not include all teachers employed by the system. \nThe new national curriculum frame and the extension of the schooling period by 2 years will place \nnew demands on teacher\u2019s skills and competencies. \n \n\n \n\n\f17. \nFacilities.  A  major  constraint  on  increasing  enrollment  and  retention  and  improving  the \nquality  of  education  services  is  the  limited  capacity  of  school  facilities,  which  continues  to \ndeteriorate  due  to  inadequate  maintenance  and  investment.  This  has  been  particularly  acute  in \nrural areas, where budget funds for O&M and resources for rehabilitation are scarce. Lack of safe \nwater and sanitation pose significant hygiene and health risks, especially for students in dormitory \nfacilities.  Building  construction  and  technology  of  schools,  which  have  not  yet  benefited  form \nrehabilitation  measures,  are  based  on  30-year  old  construction  standards  that  are  inefficient  in \nterms  of  use  of  materials,  structural  capacity,  and  energy  performance.  Insulations  are  poor  and \nurban  schools\u2019  heating  systems  are  usually  linked  to  a  public  heating  distribution  system  without \nmetering or control of consumption.  \n \n18. \nRecent  large-scale  migration  from  rural  to  urban  areas\u2014in  addition  to  being  one  of  the \nresults of declining service provision in rural areas\u2014has caused major imbalances in educational \nservice provision and has greatly tested the capacity of schools in areas witnessing high population \ninflows.11  Schools  in  urban  centers  have  seen  demand  for  services  increase  substantially,  while \nsome rural schools are now operating below capacity as a result of outflows from their catchment \nareas.  The  introduction  of  a  12-year  system  in  2008  will  cause  a  significant  increase  in  student \nnumbers in the national education system, which will be an additional burden on schools\u2019 capacity. \nThe  increase  in  enrollments  and  lack  of  additional  school  space  will  force  about  one  third  of  all \nsecondary schools to conduct classes in two or even three shifts. MECS has identified 200 out of \n710  schools  in  urgent  need  of  rehabilitation,  which  will  require  donor  assistance  due  to  national \nbudget  constraints.  The  lack  of  adequate  teaching  aids  and  learning  materials  is  another  major \nconstraint  on  applying  modern  teaching  methodologies.  In  rural  schools,  in  particular,  teaching \nequipment for science subjects and up-to-date computer equipment are lacking. Reliance on more \ntraditional resources, such as chalkboard and textbooks, in pre-service and in-service training had \nled to teaching being dominated by traditional \"chalk and talk\" centered learning. \n \n19. \nVocational and technical education has been one of most neglected areas of education \nin  Mongolia.  The  Government  enacted  legislation  to  encourage  the  private  sector  to  become \ninvolved in VTE and subsequently reduced its role in this subsector. However, only a few private \ntraining providers and companies are engaged in vocational education and are providing support. \nCurrently,  there  is  a  serious  mismatch  between  skills  supply  and  labor  market  demand,  which \nimpedes  further  economic  growth  and  leads  to  lack  of  sufficiently  skilled  labor.  The  economic \nconsequences  of  these  deficiencies  are  unemployment,  lagging  competitiveness,  insufficient \ninnovation,  and  low  productivity.  At  present,  MECS  is  the  sole  public  provider  of  VTE  for  youth. \nTraining  programs  for  youth  offered  by  private  training  institutions  are  limited  to  few  sectors  in \nurban areas. Students from rural areas are disadvantaged in gaining access to private training and \nchildren from poor families are unable to afford training fees. A lack of employment opportunities \nand adequate private and public training provisions make it crucial to promote VTE as a means to \nprovide employable skills and knowledge to students who do not advance to higher education.   \n \n20.  Mongolia\u2019s  VTE  system  is  in  need  of  comprehensive  reform.  The  current  VTE  program\u2014\noffering  a  combined  2.5-year  professional  and  general  education  based  on  the  former  Soviet \nsystem\u2014is  not  responsive  to  labor  market  demands  or  cost-effective.  Although  VTE  students \ndeclined from 11% in 1987 to 4% in 2004 as a proportion of all students in grades 1\u201310, enrollment \nin VTE institutions increased from 12,177 in 2000 to 21,911 in 2004. Graduates of the combined \nsystem  have  difficulty  competing  with  the  academic  performance  of  graduates  from  the  general \nsecondary education stream, and do not find jobs easily after graduation without further on-the-job-\ntraining due to their lack of employable skills. With the introduction of the 12-year school system, \n\n                                                 \n11  Between  1990  and  2000,  the  population  in  Ulaanbaatar  increased  by  27%.Today  about  one  third  of  the  capital's \n\npopulation of about 950,000 are migrants. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nthe vocational education system will need to adjust to the new national curriculum framework. The \nnew school organizational structure will have implications for the entry level and entry qualifications \nof  students  enrolling  in  VTE,  and  needs  to  be  reflected  in  the  development  of  new  vocational \ncurriculum modules.  \n \nTraining  programs  currently  offered  by  MECS  are  supply-driven  and  have  not  yet \n21. \nsignificantly  refocused  on  the  emerging  needs  of  the  labor  market.  VTE  institutions  are  often  not \nfully aware of industry\u2019s needs and are not able to explore ways to involve industry (such as on-\nthe-job  training,  attachments,  and  apprenticeship  programs).  School  facilities  have  deteriorated, \nadequate  training  equipment  is  lacking  or  outdated,  and  consumables and  tools  are  lacking.  The \nteaching  techniques,  technical skills,  and  knowledge  of  many  teachers are  outdated  and  need  to \nbe  upgraded.  Teachers  have  no  benchmarks  to  measure  their  own  technical  and  instructional \ncapability, and thus have no means of determining the gap between their current performance and \ndesired  capability.  Cooperation  between  MECS,  MLSW,  and  other  training  providers  is  weak.  A \nnational policy on VTE (linking both systems under MECS and MLSW with present and future labor \nmarket needs) and a recognized national system for skills standards are not in place.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Policy \n\n22. \nThe Government\u2019s Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS), \nthe  National  Action  Plan,  and  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  for  education,  together \ndescribe  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  in  the  education  sector.  The  Project  will \ncontribute to two MDGs: \u201cAchieve universal primary education\u201d and \u201cEliminate gender disparity in \nprimary and secondary education\u201d. The Government considers strengthening the education system \nas an integral part of its (i) economic growth strategy, aimed at steady, private sector-led growth; \nand (ii) social strategy, aimed at improving access of the poor to stable income opportunities and \nimproving the quality and accessibility of public services.  \n \n23. \nThe  Government\u2019s  education  policy  has  been  driven  by  the  Education  Sector  Strategy \n(ESS) (2000\u20132005) and the Education for All strategic plan. The major focus of the ESS has been \non  improvements  in  (i)  access  to,  and  quality  and  relevance  of,  basic  education  services;  and \n(ii) development  of  qualified  and  competitive  human  resources,  contributing  to  raise  economic \ngrowth.  Building  on  the  achievements  and  lessons  learned  from  the  ESS  (2000\u20132005),  MECS  is \ncurrently developing a new Education Master Plan for 2006\u20132015 with assistance from ADB. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n24. \nADB  and  the  Government  of  Japan  are  the  major  development  partners  in  the  education \nsector  in  Mongolia.  ADB  has  supported  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  the  education \nsystem  since  the  early  1990s  (para  30).  The  Government  of  Japan  is  financing  the  upgrading  of \nprimary  and  secondary  schools,  strengthening  teacher  training,  and  providing  support  for \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  education.  ADB  has  coordinated  with  the \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency,  whose  feasibility  study  on  school  construction  and \nrehabilitation  contributed  significantly  to  the  SEDP\u2019s  design.  The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF)  is  active  in  preschool,  nonformal,  and  primary  education.  The  Danish  International  \nDevelopment  Assistance  agency  has  supported  the  development  of  40  rural  schools.  The  World \nBank has financed small-scale renovations of schools under its Poverty Alleviation Program and is \nfinancing a public expenditure tracking survey in the education sector. Currently, the World Bank is \npreparing  a  Rural  Education  Support  Project  financed  from  an  International  Development \nAssociation  grant.  Germany  has  provided  support  for  selected  vocational  schools  while  the \nEuropean  Union  has  provided  support  for  higher  education.  With  the  exception  of  assistance \nprovided  by  ADB  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  inputs  by  these \n\n \n\n\fagencies  have  been  relatively  modest  in  financial  terms.  In  2004,  the  Government  submitted  a \nproposal to the Millennium Challenge Corporation with a sizeable educational component, which is \ncurrently under review. An overview of donor funded projects is in Appendix 3. The project design \nhas been prepared in close coordination with JICA, World Bank, UNICEF, and Germany [GTZ].  \n \nAt  present,  investment  in  the  education  sector  is  fragmented.  Externally  financed  projects \n25. \nare  largely  planned  and  executed  directly  between  development  agencies  and  the  Government, \nlimiting  coordination  and  coherence  between  projects  and  raising  transaction  costs.  To  enhance \nharmonization and coordination, and improve the efficiency of donor assistance, the Government \nand the donor community agreed that the current cooperation mechanism needs to be improved. \nDonor  interventions  should  be  fully  in  accordance  with  government  policies,  under  government \nleadership.  At  the  initiative  of  ADB,  World  Bank,  JICA,  and  UNICEF,  the  proposal  to  gradually \nestablish  a  sector  wide  approach  (SWAp)  in  the  education  sector  emerged,  with  agreement  that \nADB  would  take  the  lead.  The  proposed  SWAp  strategy  will  be  underpinned  by  a  partnership-\nbased  approach  aimed  at  enhancing  joint  donor  planning  towards  direct  budget  support  for  the \nnational  education  system.  As  a  first  step  in  that  direction,  MECS  and  key  donors  have  formally \nagreed  to  establish  a  donor  consultative  mechanism  in  education,  aimed  at  enhancing  donor \ncoordination and harmonization within the framework of the new Master Plan. \n  \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nThe  project  design  takes  into  consideration  experience  gained  and  lessons  learned  in \n26. \nimplementing  the  ESDP,  the  ongoing  SEDP,  and  the  project  for  Innovating  Rural  Education  in \nMongolia through ICT (IIREM).12 Through ESDP\u2019s reform program, the education facilities and staff \nof  around  120  primary  and  secondary  schools  were  rationalized  and  merged  into  45  complex \nschools,  which  contributed  to  improving  the  effectiveness  of  the  education  system  and  quality  of \neducation  services.  By  2004,  210  schools  have  been  rehabilitated  under  the  ESDP  and  SEDP, \nwhich  has  resulted  in  stronger  student  participation  in  rural  areas,  decreased  dropout  rates,  and \nimproved  teaching  and  learning  environments.  The  Project  will  benefit  from  the  technical \nexperience  in  school  rehabilitation,  in  particular  regarding  improving  heating  systems,  sanitation, \nand roof repairs. The selection criteria for schools to be rehabilitated under the Project will consider \nindicators  to  increase  participation  of  poor  students  in  rural  areas  and  students  from  migrant \nfamilies in urban centers. \n \n27. \nSEDP  and  IIREM  have  developed  strategies  for  using  ICT  to  bring  education  content, \nmodern  pedagogy,  and  information  to  schools.  Lessons  learned  from  these  projects  will  help  to \ndevelop  a  new  in-service  teacher  training  approach  based  on  ICT  methods.  Further  lessons \nlearned relate to the need to ensure that (i) adequate O&M budgets and preventive maintenance of \nrehabilitated  school  facilities  are  provided,  (ii)  necessary  infrastructure  is  in  place  prior  to  the \nprovision  of  modern  teaching  and  learning  equipment,  and  (iii)  sufficient  budgets  are  in  place  to \ncover ensuing expenditures for utilizing ICT equipment and facilities efficiently. \n \n28. \nA major lesson learned relates to the importance of donor coordination. At present, the level \nof  harmonization  of  donor  activities  in  the  education  sector  is  low  and  MECS  manages  donor \nfunded  projects  largely  on  an  individual  basis. The  Project\u2019s  strategy  aims  at  achieving  improved \ndonor  harmonization  and  coordination  across  the  sector.  Through  an  associated  TA,  the  project \ndesign  addresses  the  need  to  strengthen  MECS\u2019  core  technical  and  management  capacity  to \nenable the ministry to take a phased approach to establishing a SWAp in education. \n                                                 \n12ADB.  2004.  Grant  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Innovating  Rural  Education  in  Mongolia.  Manila.  IIREM  aims  at \nestablishing  a  replicable  model  for  using  ICT to  bring  education  content,  modern  pedagogy,  and  information  to  poor \nrural schools; and includes empowerment of rural teachers in basic education grades to improve teaching practice and \nfoster a pupil centered learning environment. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s assistance to the education sector in Mongolia has evolved since the early 1990s to \nsupport  the  Government  in  the  different  stages  of  reforming  and  strengthening  the  education \nsystem.  ESDP  was  approved  in  1996  and  included  (i)  a  program  loan  to  support  fundamental \npolicy  reforms  in  the  organization,  management,  staffing,  and  financing  of  the  education  sector; \nand (ii) a project loan to support initial investments. SEDP was approved in 2002 and builds on the \ninitial reform framework established by ESDP, with focus on school and kindergarten rehabilitation, \nprovision of learning materials, and limited support in curriculum development and teacher training. \nESDP was completed in 2002 and rated highly successful in the project completion report.13 The \nimplementation progress of SEDP is fully satisfactory. The Project focuses on two major features \nwhich have not been addressed by previous interventions: (i) a comprehensive curriculum reform \nin support of the Government\u2019s decision to extend the schooling period by 2 years, which will align \nMongolia\u2019s  education  system  with  international  standards;  and  (ii)  reforming  the  current  VTE \nsystem, which is a government priority, to promote economic growth. \n \nThe focus of the Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Education.14 Activities are aimed \n30. \nat reducing poverty and providing knowledge and skills essential to meet the needs of a demand-\ndriven  modern  economy.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  education  sector,  as  outlined  in  the  CSP  2006\u2013\n2008, will remain focused on (i) improving access to, and quality of, basic education services; (ii) \nmore  efficient  and  effective  education  provision;  (iii)  promoting  demand-driven  vocational \neducation;  and  (iv)  more  effective  donor  coordination.  The  new  Education  Master  Plan  2006\u2013\n201515 is considered a key sector output, which will provide a strategic framework to ensure that \neducation  spending  and  investment  in  the  sector  is  evidence-based,  informed,  and  sustainable. \nAfter supporting the Government in reforming the curriculum framework and adopting a SWAp in \nthe education sector, future ADB assistance is expected to focus on providing education services \nto rural and marginal urban populations and further development of private provision of education \nand skills training, as set out in the CSPU 2005\u20132006.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n31. \nThe impact of the Project will be improved employability and income-earning opportunities \nof  graduates  from  secondary  and  vocational  education.  The  project  outcome  is  more  equitable \naccess to\u2014and improved quality and relevance of\u2014primary, secondary, and vocational education. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  developing  a  national  curriculum  framework  and \n32. \naligned  education  standards,  (ii)  improving  teaching  and  learning  environments  in  primary  and \nsecondary schools, and (iii) promoting demand-driven vocational education for youth. \n \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB.2003.

Four  subcomponents  will  contribute  to  meet  these  objectives: \n(i) developing a national 12-year curriculum framework, including the rationalization of subjects for \nbasic education; (ii) establishing a mechanism to streamline educational standards, based on the \nnew  curriculum  framework,  and  linking  them  to  national  standards  for  teacher  education; \n(iii) establishing  a  national  accreditation  system  for  pre-service  teacher  training  programs  and  a \nteacher certification system; and (iv) establishing a comprehensive professional development and \nin-service teacher training system based on the new standards and national curriculum framework. \nThe component will include assistance to develop strategies for textbook preparation, including the \nestablishment of national textbook standards. \n \n\na. \n\nDevelopment of a National Curriculum Framework \n\n34. \nThis  subcomponent  will  assist  MECS  in  rationalizing  the  number  of  subjects  in  basic \neducation and developing a new national curriculum framework based on core subjects organized \ninto  key  learning  areas  (KLAs)17  and  key  learning  outcomes.  The  curriculum  framework  will  be \nstudent-centered  and  will  include  (i)  the  scope  and  sequence  of  student  learning  for  all  core \nsubjects;  (ii)  a  national  curriculum  statement;  (iii)  a  national  policy  for  assessment  and  reporting; \n(iv)  teacher  guides  for  preschool,  primary,  and  secondary  education;  (v)  new  syllabi  and  teacher \nguides for integrated subjects;18 (vi) in-service modules to support implementation of the curriculum \nframework; and (vii) implementation guides for school head teachers. Prior to the development of \nthe  national  curriculum  framework,  30  teacher  educators  selected  from  MECS,  universities, \ncolleges,  and  schools  will  receive  up  to  3  months  training  in  overseas  departments  of  education \nwhere  they  will  work  alongside  education  officers  responsible  for  curriculum  and  education \nstandards.  Criteria  to  select  the  teacher  educators  will  be  developed  by  MECS,  with  ADB \nconcurrence. Supported by international and domestic consultants, these teacher educators will\u2014\njointly with MECS\u2014develop the new curriculum framework and revise standards and guidelines for \ntextbook  development.  The  national  curriculum  framework  will  be  accompanied  by  developing \nuser-friendly  manuals  for  understanding  and  using  the  framework,  teaching  methods  handbooks \nfor  each  of  the  core  subjects,  and  teacher  guidebooks.  These  manuals  and  guidebooks  will  be \nprovided  to  all  21,000  primary  and  secondary  teachers.  A  further  4,000  sets  of  materials  will  be \nprepared for graduates entering the teaching profession during the life of the Project.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening National Education Standards \n\nThe  objective  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  assist  MECS  in  developing  education  standards \n35. \nfor  each  subject  and  grade  consistent  with  the  new  national  curriculum  framework.  The  national \neducation standards will provide the education system\u2019s expectations of students in each subject, \ndescribing  what  students  should  know  and  be  able  to  do  at  each  grade  level.  The  education \nstandards  will  reflect  the  increasing  complexity  and  sophistication  that  students  are  expected  to \n\n                                                 \n16  The  project  design  acknowledges  the  importance  of  early  childhood  education  to  improve  the  learning  abilities  of \nstudents and reduce dropout rates. The curriculum framework will include curriculum revision for preschool, covering \nchildren aged 3\u20135. UNICEF intends to assist MECS in revising the curriculum and standards for kindergarten students.   \n17  MECS is rationalizing the current curriculum to a  new  set of core subjects covering KLAs, including  the arts, health, \nphysical  education,  foreign  languages,  mathematics,  Mongolian  (language  and  literature),  science,  social  studies \n(history and geography), and technology. \n\n18 Physics, chemistry, and biology will be integrated into natural science for grades 6\u20139. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nachieve  as  they  progress  through  school.  Eighty  teachers  with  a  strong  grasp  of  curriculum \npractice will receive 4 weeks\u2019 training on developing education standards and improving the quality \nof  learning  assessments  provided  by  international  and  domestic  experts.  Groups  of  10  teachers \nwill  be  trained  to  focus  on  each  of  the  nine  core  subjects  and  allied  KLAs.  This  group  of  80 \nteachers  will  lead  the  revision  of  the  educational  standards  to  conform  with  the  new  12-year \ncurriculum  framework,  jointly  with  education  experts  from  the  National  Center  on  Standardization \nand  Metrology,  the  Institute  of  Education,  and  the  30  teacher  educators.  Based  on  the  national \ncurriculum  framework  and  the  revised  education  standards,  the  Project  will  assist  MECS  in \nestablishing  a  National  Education  Examination  Scheme  to  ensure  uniform  standards  of \nexaminations in grades 8, 10, and 12. \n \n\nEstablishing a National Accreditation System for Pre-Service  \n\nc. \n            Programs and Developing a Teacher Certification System \n\n \n36. \nIn  parallel  with  the  development  of  the  new  curriculum  framework  and  the  revision  of \neducation  standards,  the  Project  will  support  the  Mongolian  National  Council  for  Education \nAccreditation (NCEA) in developing an accreditation system for pre-service teacher programs. To \nensure  the  quality  of  pre-service  teacher  training,  university  and  college  teacher  education \nprograms  will  need  to  be  approved  by  NCEA.  Five  key  officers  from  NCEA,  MECS,  and  the \nUniversities  and  Professional  Teacher  Association  will  participate  in  a  10-day  overseas  training \nprogram on accreditation systems. In addition, the 30 teacher educators will provide training on the \nnew  curriculum  framework  for  department  heads  and  program  directors  from  universities  and \ncolleges  to  make  certain  that  pre-service  programs  follow  the  new  curriculum  framework.  To \nensure  that  new  teachers  meet  the  required  qualification,  the  Project  will  support  MECS  in  the \nestablishment of a teacher accreditation system for graduates of teacher training programs. \n \n\nd. \n\nStrengthening Professional Development for Teachers \n\nThis  subcomponent  will  strengthen  in-service  training  of  teachers  to  implement  the  new \n37. \ncurriculum and improve  learning assessment. The Project will assist MECS in establishing an in-\nservice teacher training system which will provide continuous training opportunities to upgrade the \ncapacity  of  teachers.  Supported  by  national  consultants  and  education  standards  specialists,  the \nteacher  educators  trained  overseas  on  curriculum  and  standards  development  will  train  300 \nteacher mentors across Mongolia, who will, in turn, train teachers to implement the new curriculum \nin schools, applying student-centered teaching methods and new assessment techniques. Teacher \nmentors  will  be  given  4  weeks  of  training  and  equipped  with  manuals.  Training  programs  will  be \nconducted  in  cooperation  with  the  ECDs  at  aimag  level  and  will  include  all  teachers  currently  in \nservice.  \n \n38. \nIn  addition  to  in-service  training  conducted  by  teacher  mentors,  the  Project  will  support \nMECS  to  establish  an  ICT-based  teacher  training  platform  that  will  offer  updated  information  on \neducation content, modern pedagogy, relevant support for lesson plans, and reference material for \nteachers. Many ECDs have state-of-the-art ICT facilities, including video conference facilities and \nInternet access, enabling teachers to engage in interactive in-service teacher training. This highly \neffective  means  of  professional  development  for  teachers  needs  to  be  strengthened  and \nexpanded.  In  building  on  the  achievements  of  SEDP  and  IIREM,  the  Project  will  assist  MECS  to \nfurther  develop  and  implement  a  continuous  in-service  teacher  training  approach  using  ICT \ntechnology and distance learning. Selected teachers and experts from universities, ECDs, and the \nInstitute of Education will design new professional development programs for teachers, focusing on \nschool-based curriculum development and student-centered teaching methodologies. The Project \nwill  build  on  teacher  education  initiatives  started  under  SEDP  and  draw  on  examples  of  best \npractice teacher education from other projects supported by donors, nongovernment organizations \n\n \n\n\f(NGOs),  and  the  private  sector.  Training  packages  will  include  virtual  textbooks  and  instructional \nmaterials using a combination of CD-ROM instructional programs and distance learning developed \nby a range of agencies. The computers provided under SEDP and proposed under the Project will \nprovide  a  technological  base  for  transforming  teacher  professional  development  from  lectures  to \ninteractive learning, using computer-based problem solving techniques. Virtual science laboratories \nas a substitute for scarce textbooks will also be explored under this subcomponent. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Improving the Learning Environment in Primary and  \n Secondary Schools \n\n \n39. \nThis  component  will  assist  MECS  to  improve  the  teaching  and  learning  environment  in \nprimary and secondary schools and rationalize O&M costs. About 45 schools will be identified for \ncomprehensive  rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation  priorities  include  (i)  provision  of  adequate  heating \nsystems  and  insulation;  (ii)  improvement  of  roof  structures;  (iii)  repair  of  sanitation  systems; \n(iv) repair  of  defective  walls  and  ceilings  (including  replacement  of  damaged  floors,  doors, \nwindows);  and  (v)  upgrading  of  school  and  dormitory  facilities.  To  improve  access  for  disabled \nstudents, who may have faced exclusion, rehabilitation works will include provision of facilities for \nwheelchair-bound students, adjusted furniture, equipment, and improved sanitary facilities. Building \non the experience gained in rehabilitating schools under ESDP and SEDP, local civil engineering \nconsultants will  support the  Construction  Client Unit  (CCU)  in  MECS  in  planning  and  supervising \nrehabilitation  works.  Lessons  learned  in  establishing  \"child-friendly  schools\"  under  the  UNICEF \nprogram will be incorporated. UNICEF intends to provide assistance to advise CCU on the design \nof  rehabilitation  works.  Key  rehabilitation  activities  will  be  scheduled  to  coincide  with  the  long \nsummer holidays to minimize disruption to school operations. The current state of school facilities \nis described in Appendix 5. \n \n40. \nTo improve the quality of teaching and learning, a package of educational equipment will be \nprovided  to  each  of  the  rehabilitated  schools  consisting  of  classroom  furniture,  basic  science \nlaboratory equipment and simple science kits, and ICT equipment (including classroom computers \nand software applications). A set of hand tools and equipment will be provided to each school for \nuse in routine maintenance work by school maintenance personnel. \n \n41. \nTo achieve community ownership of the rehabilitated school plant and ensure the provision \nof  regular  maintenance,  school  management  community  members  will  (i)  be  involved  in  the \nplanning  of  rehabilitation  works,  and  (ii)  participate  in  the  day-to-day  supervision  by  working  in \npartnership  with  the  civil  engineer  to  ensure  that  contractors  implement  rehabilitation  works  as \nspecified  in  the  rehabilitation  contract.  The  expertise  of  JICA\u2019s  Community-Based  Rehabilitation \nProject will be tapped to assist the CCU and the project implementation unit (PIU) in developing a \nstrategy to mobilize community support in school rehabilitation. \n \n42.  MECS has provided a priority list of schools to be rehabilitated under this component. The \nselection  criteria  include  (i)  schools  with  high  enrollments  of  students  from  poor  families  and/or \nmigrants, (ii) school staff and community members\u2019 commitment to participate in the rehabilitation \nand  maintenance  works,  and  (iii)  evidence  that  adequate  O&M  budget  will  be  provided  for \nrehabilitated schools. Proposed selection criteria for schools to be rehabilitated are in Appendix 6. \nFinal  selection  of  schools  and  scope  of  rehabilitation  works  will  be  submitted  by  MECS  for  ADB \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n43. \nAt least 30 schools will be selected as model schools for effective teaching. Schools will be \nselected from among those already rehabilitated under ESDP, SEDP, and JICA support, and are \nconsidered to be model schools in particular subject areas. These model schools will be developed \nto serve as venues for in-service teacher training, including the application of ICT-based training to \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Promoting Demand-Driven Vocational Education \n\nimprove student-centered teaching and learning methods based on the new curriculum. Upgrading \nof model school facilities will include the (i) provision of ICT equipment and software for developing \nand  producing  teaching  and  learning  materials,  (ii)  provision  of  teaching  equipment  for \nmultipurpose rooms, and (iii) upgrading of library facilities with provision of textbooks and reference \nmaterials.  Model  schools  will  also  need  to  demonstrate  child-friendly  school  strategies  and \npreparedness to enroll disabled children and children from poor families. \n \n \n \nAt present, MECS is the sole public sector provider of VTE for youth. The objective of this \n44. \ncomponent  is  to  assist  MECS  in  reforming  the  current  VTE  system  to  improve  the  quality  and \nrelevance of VTE and make it more demand-driven, which will contribute to increased employment \nand  earning  opportunities  for  graduates.  A  reformed  VTE  system  will  address  the  mismatch \nbetween  skills  supply  and  labor  market  demand.  The  component  has  two  subcomponents: \n(i) establishing a policy framework conducive to promote demand-driven VTE, including stimulating \nprivate training provision; and (ii) rehabilitation of facilities and upgrading of training equipment of \nsix VTE institutions. \n \n\na. \n\nEstablishing a Policy Framework for VTE \n\n \n45. \nThe  Project  will  assist  MECS  to  develop\u2014jointly  with  MLSW,  other  major  government \nstakeholders, and industry\u2014a national policy framework promoting demand-driven VTE. The policy \nframework  will  (i)  streamline  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  arrangements  for  the  subsector; \n(ii) define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  major  stakeholders;  and  (iii)  provide  national  skills \nstandards  and  a  National  Vocational  Qualification  (NVQ)  system  based  on  standards  of \ncompetence  set  by  industry.  The  Project  will  take  into  consideration  lessons  learned  from  the \nSocial  Security  Sector  Development  Program,19  which  initiated  policy  changes  to  promote \nemployment  through  skills  training  and  entrepreneurship  development  and  has  developed  skills \ntraining modules. An analysis of the VTE subsector is in Appendix 7.  \n \n46. \nParallel to the development of a national policy framework, the Project will assist MECS in \nreforming the current VTE system, in particular addressing challenges related to (i) the revision of \nthe  current  2.5-year  combined  professional  and  general  education  program;  (ii)  developing  new \nprofiles  for  VTE  institutions,  focusing  on  the  provision  of  relevant  demand-driven  vocational \neducation  programs  for  skilled  labor;  (iii)  adjusting  VTE  programs  to  the  reformed  national \ncurriculum framework and the extended grade 1\u201312 school structure (including the amendment of \nentry  levels  and  qualification  requirements  of  students);  (iv)  developing  new  demand-driven \ncurriculum  in  close  cooperation  with  industry,  based  on  market  surveys  and  internationally \naccepted  standards;  and  (v)  qualification  of  vocational  teachers  and  the  need  for  an  in-service \nteacher training system.20 In addition to the reform of vocational education for skilled workers, the \nProject  will  assist  MECS  in  reviewing  diploma  and  bachelor  programs  offered  by  6  technical \ncolleges  and  12  branch  schools  to  improve  the  demand  orientation  of  its  curriculum  in  line  with \nlabor market needs and revised national skills standards. \n \nThe Project will implement a public information campaign to (i) enhance awareness among \n47. \nthe public, students, and parents about the new profile of VTE institutions and income-earning and \nemployment  opportunities  of  VTE  graduates;  and  (ii)  improve  the  low  social  status  of  VTE. \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Mongolia \n\nfor the Social Security Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n20  JICA  has  indicated  that  it  will  consider  providing  a  technical  assistance  to  support  MECS  in  the  areas  of  curriculum \n\ndevelopment and teacher training. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nb. \n\nEstablishing Model Institutions for Vocational Education \n\nAwareness  promotion  will  include  multimedia  campaigns  and  printed  material.  A  professional \nmedia company will be contracted to prepare and conduct the public information campaign. \n \n48. \nGermany  [GTZ]  intends  to  support  project  activities  by  providing  40  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services to assist MECS in policy development, preparation of a transition \nstrategy for VETCs and VTPCs, development of national skills standards, preparation of the NVQ, \ndesign of demand-driven curriculum modules, and preparation of an awareness strategy.  \n \n \n \n49. \nOnce  an  agreed  national  VTE  policy  framework  and  an  approved  reform  strategy  for  the \nVTE  system  is  in  place,  six  VTE  institutions  will  be  selected  for  rehabilitation  and  modernization. \nThe  selection  criteria  will  include  (i)  preparedness  to  enroll  students  from  poor  and/or  migrated \nfamilies, (ii) evidence that adequate budget will be provided for O&M of equipment and provision of \nconsumables, (iii) confirmation that the new curriculum at institution level is relevant and demand-\ndriven, (iv) evidence of industry involvement, and (v) availability of qualified teachers. The Project \nwill upgrade and rehabilitate school and dormitory facilities, including repair of heating systems and \nfloor and roof structures, improving sanitation and electrical systems, and provision of facilities for \ndisabled  students.  The  Project  will  provide  the  institutions  with  furniture,  teaching  aids,  and \n10 classroom  computers  (each  with  software  applications  to  support  teaching  and  learning).  The \nselection  of  training  equipment  will  be  based  on  training  programs  to  be  conducted  at  the  four \nmodel schools. Market surveys will be carried out to determine dynamic economic subsectors that \noffer high employment opportunities for graduates as skilled labor. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n50. \nBy  establishing  a  national  12-year  curriculum  framework  with  consistent  education \nstandards and reforming the VTE system to become demand-driven, the Project will assist MECS \nin completing the transition of Mongolia\u2019s education system from the Soviet model to a system that \nis  consistent  with  internationally  accepted  requirements  of  a  market-based  economy.  Through \nimproving  learning  environments  in  rural  areas,  where  poverty  is  prevalent,  the  attendance  and \ncompletion rate of poor students will be increased. Only schools that have at least 30% of enrolled \nstudents from poor families will be selected for rehabilitation under the Project to ensure that poor \ncommunities will benefit from improved learning environments. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n51.  Model  schools  with  a  child-friendly  learning  environment  and  access  to  safe  water  and \nsanitation  will  demonstrate  modern  learning  environments,  student-centered  teaching  methods, \nintegration of disabled students, school-based curriculum development, and school-based teacher \nprofessional development. The introduction of uniform transparent student learning assessments\u2014\naligned  to  education  standards\u2014will  enable  the  Government  to  monitor  quality  improvements  of \nthe education system. To further improve effectiveness and efficiency in the education sector, ADB \nwill provide TA to support MECS in improving donor coordination towards gradually establishing a \nSWAp  in  education.  The  new  Education  Master  Plan  will  provide  the  policy  structure  to  improve \ncoordination in the sector. The TA will include support in strengthening the financial management \nstructure as a precondition for developing a SWAp.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $16.38  million  equivalent.

The chairman will be appointed by \nthe minister of education and will be the project director. The PSC will provide strategic guidance, \n                                                 \n21 The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented in special drawing rights (SDR) equivalent of \nUS  dollars,  with  reference  only  to  total  expenditure,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of \nExpenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. \n\n22  The Government of Japan\u2019s assistance will not be implemented through the Project. \n\n \n\n\fmonitor  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  and  ensure  donor  coordination.  The  PSC  will  meet \nquarterly, or as often as required. The project director will coordinate the overall implementation of \nproject activities.  \n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  current  SEDP-PIU,  staffed  by  a  project \nmanager and five additional staff, who will be responsible for the overall implementation of project \nactivities.  Office  space  for  the  PIU  will  be  provided  by  MECS.  The  PIU  will  report  to  the  project \ndirector and provide quarterly results-based progress reports to the PSC, MECS management, and \nADB.  The  ongoing  SEDP  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  2007  while  the  Project  is  planned  to \ncommence in 2006. A joint implementation plan for activities planned for 2006\u20132007 will be agreed \non during the first quarter of implementation. After completion of the SEDP, qualified staff will be \nassigned through competitive selection and confirmed by PSC. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  September  2006  to  September  2011. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n57. \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n58. \nAll  ADB-financed  civil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works will involve rehabilitation of existing facilities, but \nthere  will  be  no  construction  of  new  facilities.  Civil  work  contracts  will  be  less  than  $1  million. \nDomestic  contractors  are  capable  of  carrying  out  all  rehabilitation  works,  so  civil  work  contracts \nestimated  to  cost  $1  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n59. \nThe Project will provide teaching aids, classroom furniture, learning materials, and manuals \nas well as ICT, laboratory, and VTE equipment. Equipment and goods estimated to cost more than \n$500,000  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Equipment  and \nmaterials  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less  will  be  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Teacher  manuals  and  other  equipment  and  materials  valued  at \n$100,000 or less will be procured by shopping. Procurement plan is in Appendix 10.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n60. \nA  total  of  8  person-months  of  international  and  265  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices will be contracted, financed by ADB funds. International and national consultants financed \nfrom  ADB  funds  under  component  1  will  be  recruited  as  firms  under  quality  and  cost  based \nselection methods, using full technical proposals. National consultants under component 2 will be \nrecruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, or other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  in  engaging  national  consultants.  Under  the  guidance  of  the \nproject director, MECS will be fully involved in the selection process of the consultants. Consulting \nservices  will  include  experts  in  the  field  of  (i)  curriculum  and  standards  development,  (ii)  teacher \ntraining, (iii) civil engineers specialized in school rehabilitation, (iv) VTE policy development, and (v) \nNVQ development. Consulting service requirements and outline terms of reference for consultants \nare  in  Appendix  11.  In  order  to  field  consultants  as  soon  as  possible,  the  Government  has \nrequested advance recruitment action of a consulting firm. In addition, Germany [GTZ] intends to \nprovide  40  person-months  of  international  consulting  services,  and  UNICEF  plans  to  provide  6 \nperson-months  of  international  and  4  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  from  grant \nfunds. \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n61. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  government \nofficials.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency, \nADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MECS \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nStaff Development and Training \n\nThe Project will provide in-country and external training to upgrade skills and knowledge of \n62. \nkey  counterparts  from  MECS,  universities,  NCEA,  and  ECDs.  MECS  will  prepare  the  selection \ncriteria  for  training  candidates  for  approval  by  ADB  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness. \nSubsequently,  the  PIU  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  a  list  of  nominated  candidates,  (ii)  proposed \ntraining  institutions,  and  (iii)  detailed  costing  of  the  proposed  training  programs.  The  training \nproviders  will  be  selected  based  on  competitive  submission  of  training  proposals.  Facilities  of \nmodel schools and ECDs will be used to conduct in-service teacher training programs. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n63. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  to  expedite  disbursement  of  the  project \nproceeds.  The  PIU  will  open  the  account  in  a  commercial  bank  selected  by  the  Government, \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed \n$250,000. \n \nStatement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures under \n64. \nADB-financed  activities  and  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account,  in  accordance \nwith  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nEach  individual  payment  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  procedures  will  not  exceed  $50,000 \nequivalent for each item of expenditure. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n65.  MECS  will  maintain  the  project  accounts  and  prepare  financial  statements  according  to \ninternational  accounting  standards.  MECS  will  have  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  the \naudited  project  accounts  and  audited  financial  statements  (including  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the \nuse of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use of the imprest account under \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures)  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  in  English  not  later  than \n6 months after the end of each financial year. \n \nThe  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  to  be  approved  by  the \n66. \nPSC  and  submit  them  to  ADB  within  30  days  after  each  quarter.  Reports  will  be  in  a  form \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  will  indicate,  among  other  matters,  progress  made  against  established \ntargets, problems and constraints encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to \nbe  taken  to  resolve  problems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  the  proposed  program  of \nactivities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after completion of the Project, the PIU will \n\n \n\n\fsubmit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  providing  details  about  project  implementation, \naccomplishments, costs, benefits, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n67.  Within  the  first  3  months  of  implementation,  the  PIU  will  prepare  a  detailed  project \nimplementation  plan  to  be  approved  by  the  PSC  and  will  establish  a  project  performance \nmanagement  system  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  project  performance  management  systems.  In \naddition  to  the  performance  targets  and  indicators  specified  in  the  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework,  the  Project  will  develop  a  monitoring  mechanism  to  evaluate  project  impacts  on  the \nparticipation  of  disabled  students  and  students  from  poor  families.  Results  from  surveys  will  be \nused  to  adjust  the  annual  implementation  plans.  The  PIU,  jointly  with  MECS,  will  develop  a \nstrategy to assess whether teacher training organized by the Project is being applied in classroom \nteaching,  and  monitor  the  progress  of  the  implementation  of  the  new  national  curriculum \nframework. A regular tracer system will be established to monitor whether graduates from revised \nVTE programs have been employed or started their own income-earning activities. Feedback from \nindustry  and  parents  will  be  collected \ntraining  programs  and/or \nimplementation schedules regularly, if necessary. School rehabilitation works will also be evaluated \nannually  by  ADB,  MECS,  and  community  representatives.  The  rehabilitated  schools  will  provide \nevidence that they have received sufficient budget to carry out preventive maintenance. Evaluation \nreports on rehabilitation measures will be submitted annually to the PSC and ADB for review. \n \n\nto  monitor  and  adjust \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n68. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  semiannual  reviews  of  the  Project.  The \nreviews  will  assess  progress  in  each  component,  identify  issues  and  constraints,  and  determine \nnecessary  remedial  action  and  adjustments.  Germany  [GTZ]  and  UNICEF  will  participate  in  the \nreviews.  A  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  at  the  end  of  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The \nmidterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  and  identify \nadjustments  required;  (ii)  assess  progress  of  the  project  implementation  against  performance \nindicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation  arrangements,  if \nnecessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n69. \nADB  will  provide  associated  TA  for  the  development  of  a  SWAp  in  the  education  sector. \nThe TA will strengthen the technical and management capacity of MECS in strategic planning and \npolicy analysis and enable the ministry to set up a SWAp in the education sector gradually. A key \nprecondition for the establishment of a SWAp\u2014to align development assistance with MECS policy \npriorities\u2014is the existence of a comprehensive policy framework that provides clear directions for \nbudget  planning  and  donor  interventions.  The  new  Education  Master  Plan  2006\u20132015,  being \nprepared  with  the  assistance  of  ADB,  will  provide  the  necessary  policy  structure  for  improved \ncoordination, effectiveness, and efficiency in the sector. Since the Education Master Plan is being \nprepared in close consultation and cooperation with all key development partners, the process of \nestablishing a donor coordination mechanism is initiated. The TA will assist MECS in (i) developing \nannual  operational  implementation  strategies  to  meet  the  policy  objectives,  (ii)  identifying \ninvestment  priorities  for  modernizing  the  school  system  and  extending  the  schooling  period  as \nplanned, (iii) preparing annual and longer-term budget frameworks linked to the Education Master \nPlan  (including  financial  plans  for  regional  authorities),  and  (iv)  building  capacity  to  establish  an \nefficient  structure  to  collect  data  and  other  information  needed  for  monitoring  and  performance \nevaluation.  \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n70.  MECS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA.  The  TA  will  provide  3  person-months  of \ninternational and 48 person-months of national consulting services, with specialists in the areas of \n(i)  strategic  planning  and  policy  analysis,  (ii)  financial  analysis  and  annual  budget  preparation \nlinked to the Education Master Plan, (iii) launching of a management information system to monitor \nthe  achievement  of  policy  objectives  established  under  the  Master  Plan,  and  (iv)  improving \ncoordination  of  development  cooperation  efforts.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB.  Procurement  of  office  equipment  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Upon TA completion, all equipment will be retained by MECS.  \n \n71. \nThe TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The total \ncost of the TA is estimated at $210,000 equivalent, of which $55,000 is the foreign exchange cost \nand $155,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to finance \n$150,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost ($55,000) and $95,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  through  the \nprovision of counterpart staff, office space and furniture for TA administration, workshop facilities, \nand transport and allowances of government officials. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, \ncommencing in March 2006. Details of the TA and outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 12. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n72. \nProject  Beneficiaries.  Direct  beneficiaries  of  the  establishment  of  a  new  curriculum \nframework and the modernization of the education system will be all students enrolled in primary \nand secondary schools. Nationwide, about 560,000 students will benefit from improved curriculum, \nwell-defined education standards, and enhanced assessment systems. About 31,000 students and \n1,200  teachers  will  benefit  from  rehabilitated  school  and  dormitory  facilities  in  45  schools.  About \n23,000  students  and  900  teachers  of  30  model  schools  will  benefit  from  upgraded  teaching \nfacilities. About 21,400 teachers throughout the country will benefit from in-service teacher training \nprograms. About 21,900 students of vocational education intuitions will benefit from the reform of \nthe  VTE  system  and  a  new  demand-driven  curriculum,  which  will  improve  their  employment  and \nincome-earning  opportunities  after  graduation.  Student  and  teachers  of  four  key  VTE  institutions \nwill benefit from rehabilitated facilities and modern training equipment. Industries will benefit from \nimprovements  in  relevance  and  quality  of  VTE.  Graduates  of  VTE  institutions  entering  the  labor \nforce  will  possess  knowledge  and  skills  that  are  in  line  with  industry  requirements,  contribute  to \nhigher labor productivity, and increase economic growth. \n\n \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Social  Development  Impact.  The  Project  will  have  a  direct \n73. \nbeneficial impact on about 201,000 poor students in primary and secondary schools.23 Specific pro-\npoor and social development measures of the Project include the following: (i) targeted school for \nrehabilitation  should  have  at  least  30%  of  enrolled  students  coming  from  poor  families; \n(ii) enhanced  access  for  disabled  children  to  general  secondary  education;  and  (iii)  community \ninvolvement in school rehabilitation and maintenance. Over 90% of teachers are female, and the \nProject  will  directly  benefit  all  teachers  through  its  training  programs,  which  are  expected  to \nenhance  the  attractiveness  of  the  teaching  profession.  To  improve  gender  responsiveness,  the \nProject  will  develop  strategies  to  address  gender  stereotypes  in  curriculum  and  textbook \ndevelopment.  The  Project  was  designed  through  a  participatory  process.  During  implementation, \nthe Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities and benefit from improved \ndonor coordination. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. \n \n\n                                                 \n23  This  assumes  that  36%  of  the  students  on  average  are  from  poor  families,  a  poverty  indicator  based  on  the  World \n\nBank Living Standard Measurement Survey (1998\u20132002). \n\n \n\n\f74. \nEducational  Benefits.  The  close  link  between  educational  development  and  reduction  in \nthe  incidence  of  poverty,  improvement  of  productivity,  economic  growth,  and  improving  general \nliving  conditions  is  well  established.  The  Project  focuses  on  quality  improvements  of  the  national \neducation  system  to  complete  the  transition  of  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  and  improve \nenrollment and retention rates, including (i) improved teaching and learning environments through \na modern and relevant curriculum, student-centered teaching methods, rehabilitated and upgraded \nschool and dormitory facilities, and modern teaching equipment and materials; (ii) improved criteria \nfor  assessing  students  through  the  integration  of  education  standards  with  the  proposed  national \ncurriculum  framework;  (iii)  a  uniform  national  system  for  accreditation  of  teacher  training  and \ncertification;  and  (iv)  reforming  the  VTE  system  to  become  demand-driven,  leading  to  improved \nincome-earning and employment opportunities for young graduates. In addressing early childhood \nrequirements in curriculum reform, the Project will have an impact on the level of efficiency of the \nprimary school cycle and reduce dropout rates.24  \n \n75. \nFinancial  Benefits  and  Sustainability.  The  most  significant  economic  benefit  will  come \nfrom  increases  in  future  earnings  of  school  graduates  with  better  education  attainment \n(Supplementary Appendix B). Capacity building assistance provided through the TA\u2014in supporting \nMECS  in  areas  related  to  financial  analysis  and  preparing  annual  and  longer-term  budget \nframeworks  linked  to  the  Education  Master  Plan\u2014will  contribute  to  improve  efficiency  and \neffectiveness in the delivery of education services and reduce transaction costs.  \n \nPublic  expenditure  on  education  as  a  share  of  GDP  is  estimated  to  average  6.5%  in  the \n76. \nperiod  2006\u20132008.25  It  can  be  assumed  that  the  budget  will  be  sufficient  to  continue  education \nservice delivery at the current rate and finance the modernization of the system. By rehabilitating \nschool  facilities,  particularly  improving  heating  systems  and  insulation,  the  Project  is  expected  to \ncontribute to significant reductions in O&M costs. The Government share in the Project is included \nin the budget. Based on a projection of education expenditure, it can be assumed that the Project \nis financially sustainable (Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n77. \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will carry out minor rehabilitation and \nrepairs of existing school buildings and facilities with no land acquisition required, and no negative \nenvironmental or resettlement impact. Some school rehabilitation works will include improved water \nsupply  and  sanitation  and  sewage  systems,  which  will  promote  good  health  and  have  a  positive \nenvironmental impact. There are no issues of ethnic minority language of instruction in Mongolia, \ntherefore the Policy on Indigenous Peoples  is not applicable. \n \nAssumptions. Successful implementation of the Project assumes that the Government will \n78. \n(i) maintain the high level of budget allocation for the education sector, (ii) be committed to improve \ndonor  coordination  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  delivery  of  education \nservices, (iii) maintain its commitment to carry out education reforms (including national curriculum \nreform), (iv) provide adequate budget to provide in-service training for all teachers employed by the \nsystem, and (v) reform and rationalize the current VTE system. To achieve its impact, the Project \nassumes that further steady economic growth will create new job opportunities. \n\n \n\nRisks. At present, MECS\u2019 managerial and technical capacity is limited, and might affect the \n79. \nsmooth  implementation  of  the  extension  of  the  school  system  to  a  12-year  system  and  the \nintroduction  of  the  new  curriculum  framework  nationwide.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  through \ntraining  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project  and  associated  TA.  The  policy  impact  of \nintroducing  new  education  standards  and  uniform  assessments  will  be  significant.  Risks  include \n                                                 \n24  It  is  well  established  that  interventions  in  the  early  childhood  development  of  children  and  their  preparedness  for \n\nschool result in significant improvements in school performance and reduced dropouts.  \n\n25  There is no reliable financial information available for years beyond 2008. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nresistance from teachers and school directors to accept changes to implement the new curriculum \nframework  and  introduce  uniform  examinations.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  adopting  a \nparticipatory approach to project implementation\u2014actively involving school directors, teachers, and \ncommunities.  Financial  risks  involve  potential  difficulties  in  the  provision  of  incremental  recurrent \ncosts  for  O&M  of  rehabilitated  schools.  To  mitigate  the  risk,  ADB  will  work  closely  with  the \nGovernment to ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the education sector, incremental \nrecurrent costs for O&M are assigned, and appropriate assurances are included. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nin  a \n\nfunding \n\nThe  Government  will  allocate \n\ntimely  manner  adequate  budget \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n80. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nfor \n81. \n(i) government  counterpart  salaries,  (ii)  its  share  of  local  costs  in  support  of  training  programs, \n(iii) incremental  recurrent  costs  for  O&M  of  all  schools  and  VTE  institutions  rehabilitated  or \nsupported  under  the  Project,  and  (iv)  replacement  capital  costs  for  computer  equipment  to  be \nprocured  four  to  five  years  after  initial  procurement  of  such  equipment.

The  Ministry  also  administers  general  provisions  on  education  matters,  teacher \ntraining, curriculum development, and state examination procedures, and is responsible for the \naccreditation  of  higher  education  institutions.  The  current  structure  of  the  formal  education \nsystem is shown in Figure A2.1 while Table A2.1 provides a summary of basic institutional and \nenrollment  indicators  of  the  education  sector  in  Mongolia  over  the  past  5  years.  Education \nsector  financing  is  described  in  detail  in  Appendix  4.  The  Government\u2019s  education  policy  has \nbeen driven by the Education Sector Strategy (ESS) 2000\u20132005. Its major focus has been on \nimprovements  in  access  to,  and  quality  and  relevance  of,  basic  education  services.  However, \nprioritized  implementation  strategies  were  lacking.  Building  on  the  achievements  and  lessons \nlearned  from  the  ESS  2000\u20132005,  and  based  on  a  comprehensive  sector  review,  a  new \nEducation  Master  Plan  for  2006\u20132015  is  being  developed  with  the  assistance  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \n2. \nThe formal education system in Mongolia consists of kindergarten and preschool (up to \nage 7), primary education (4 years), lower secondary education (4 years), and upper secondary \neducation (2 years). From the 2005\u20132006 school year, the Government will extend the structure \nof school education from grades 1\u201310 (4+4+2) to grades 1\u201311 (5+4+2), with the expectation of \nhaving  a  12-year  system  (6+3+3)  in  2008.  Basic  education  (primary  and  lower  secondary \neducation)  is  compulsory  and  funded  by  the  state.  In  2004\u20132005,  557,346  students  were \nenrolled  in  710 primary  and  secondary  schools  with  a  total  of  21,458  teachers.  In  addition, \nMECS  administers  43  higher  education  institutions  and  42  vocational  and  technical  education \n(VTE)  institutions.  VTE  institutions  consist  of  22  vocational  education  and  training  centers \n(VETCs)/vocational  training  and  production  centers  (VTPCs)  that  offer  a  2.5-year  combined \nprofessional  and  general  education  based  on  the  former  Soviet  system,  which  leads  to  a \nprofessional  certificate  and  a  secondary  education  certificate;  and  14  branch  schools  and \n6 technical colleges  that  provide  advanced  training  for  higher-level  skills  development,  leading \nto a professional diploma or bachelors degree. In 2004\u20132005, 21,911 students were enrolled in \nVETCs/VTPCs/branch schools. An assessment of the VTE system is provided in Appendix 7. \n \n3. \nHigher  education  has  experienced  the  most  rapid  enrollment  expansion  of  any  level  of \neducation  in  Mongolia  over  the  past  4  years.  The  number  of  higher  education  institutions  has \nincreased to 178 during the past 10 years, of which 135 are private. Enrollment in private higher \neducation institutions has more than doubled over the past 4 years. It is estimated that 80% of \nsecondary  school  graduates  continue  into  postsecondary  education.  In  1994,  the  Government \nbegan requiring public higher education institutions to begin charging tuition at levels sufficient \nto  cover  the  entire  cost  of  academic  staff  salaries,  thus  generating  a  large  reduction  in  the \ngovernment higher education budget. \n \n4. \nThe  strength  of  the  Mongolian  education  system  is  its  high  coverage  of  a  widely \ndispersed population. This is reflected in a gross enrollment rate of 98% among the school-age \npopulation and an adult literacy rate of 97%. Further, unlike most developing countries, girls are \nnot  disadvantaged  in  the  educational  system.  In  fact,  60%  of  all  students  enrolled  in  higher \neducation  in  Mongolia  are  females.  However,  greater  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  address \nissues  related  to  dropout  rates.  Table  A2.1  reflects  a  decline  in  the  dropout  rate  across  the \nentire  Mongolian  education  system,  yet  there  are  continuing  concerns  about  the  accuracy  of \nofficial  statistics.  In  a  recent  study  of  school  dropouts  in  Mongolia,  numbers  of  out  of  school \nchildren provided by different agencies ranged from 11,953 (MECS) to 68,115 (National Human \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nRights  Commission  of  Mongolia).  The  study  revealed  that  migrant  children  were  more  than \nthree times more likely to be out of school than long-term resident children.26 \n \n5. \nKey issues in the current Mongolian education system are (i) poor quality and relevance \nof  the  current  curriculum  for  primary  and  secondary  education,  (ii)  inadequate  teaching \nqualifications  and  skills,  (iii)  weak  learning  and  teaching  environments  in  schools,  and \n(iv) supply-driven  irrelevant  vocational  education  for  youth.  Despite  progress  in  revising  the \ncurriculum  and  syllabi,  the  basic  education  curriculum  remains  overloaded  with  subject  and \ncontent requirements, with insufficient emphasis on student-centered learning. The Government \nhas  decided  to  extend  the  current  organizational  structure  of  school  education  from  a  10-year \nsystem to a 12-year system in 2008, which will require reform of the curriculum framework and \ndevelopment  of  new  education  standards  linked  to  the  curriculum.  At  present,  student \nexaminations  have  little  transparency  due  to  lack  of  clear  standards.  Exams  are  not  prepared \naccording to uniform national standards or comparable between schools, which makes it difficult \nto  monitor  quality.  Lack  of  a  comprehensive  teacher  in-service  training  system  and  a  uniform \nnational teacher accreditation system are key constraints on improving the quality of education. \nTeachers  graduate  from  universities  and  colleges  with  different  levels  of  education.  Teaching \ntechniques and subject knowledge of many teachers are inadequate and outdated and need to \nbe  upgraded.  In  addition,  the  extension  of  the  schooling  period  by  2  years  will  place  new \ndemands on teachers\u2019 skills and competencies. \n \n6. \nA major constraint in increasing enrolment and retention and in improving the quality of \neducation services is the limited capacity of school facilities, which continues to deteriorate. This \nhas been particularly acute in rural areas, where budget funds for preventive maintenance and \ntechnical resources for rehabilitation are scarce. Building construction and technology are based \non  30-year  old  construction  standards,  which  are  inefficient  in  terms  of  use  of  materials, \nstructural capacity, and energy performance. \n \nCurrently, the harmonization level of donor activities in the education sector is very low. \n7. \nDonor-funded projects are not linked to the overall policy framework and are managed largely \non  an  individual  basis.  The  low  coordination  level  results  in  ineffective  and  inefficient  use  of \nscarce  resources  in  the  education  sector.  The  new  Education  Master  Plan  will  provide  the \nnecessary  policy  for  improved  coordination,  effectiveness,  and  efficiency  in  the  sector.  Policy \nobjectives  established  under  the  master  plan  will  need  to  be  prioritized  and  translated  into \noperational  implementation  strategies  and  annual  budget  plans.  However,  due  to  MECS \ncapacity  limitations,  an  effective  planning  structure  is  not  in  place.  Strategic  planning,  policy \nanalysis, and evaluative research need to be strengthened to enhance planning and budgeting.  \n\n                                                 \n26    Batbaatar,  M.,  et  al.  2005.

Subsectoral  shares  of  public \neducation  expenditure  have  fluctuated  very  little  from  2000  to  2004  (Table  A4.3).  There  have \nbeen slight declines in the shares of kindergarten, primary, and secondary education and higher \neducation;  a  slight  increase  in  the  share  of  vocational  and  technical  education  (VTE);  and  a \ndoubling  of  the  share  of  other  items  of  expenditure,  which  include  the  Ministry  of  Education, \n                                                 \n27 Data  for  2003  received  from  the  preliminary  findings  of  the  World  Bank/Open  Society  Forum  Public  Expenditure \nTracking  Survey  being  conducted  in  2005  (for  grades  1\u201310  schools,  special  schools,  private  schools,  and \ntemporary  courses)  indicate  that  revenue  sources  were  as  follows  in  2003:  central  budget  81.7%,  local  budget \n9.3%, tuition fees 4.1%, income generating activities 1.6%, donations 0.1%, project funds 0.4%, and others 2.7%. \n28 For  reasons  as  yet  unexplained,  education  expenditure  figures  given  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy \n(MFE)  are  different  from\u2014generally  higher  than\u2014those  given  by  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science \n(MECS). According to MFE, education expenditure as a share of GDP has been on average 8% between 2000 and \n2004, falling from 8.8% in 2001 to 7.3% in 2004.

In 2002, there was a decline in \ntotal  recurrent  expenditure  but  an  increase  in  capital  expenditure,  mainly  in  the  primary  and \nsecondary  education  and  other  categories.  In  2003,  there  was  only  a  minimal  increase  in \nrecurrent expenditure overall\u2014with expenditure on kindergartens recovering to its 2000 level\u2014\nbut  a  further  increase  in  capital  expenditure,  except  in  the  VTE  subsector  where  capital \nexpenditure  appears  to  have  ceased  altogether.  In  2004,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in \nrecurrent  expenditure  (reflecting  a  25%  increase  in  the  salaries  of  civil  servants,  including \nteachers) but a decline in capital expenditure overall in line with the Government\u2019s move to keep \nthe fiscal deficit in check. The approved budget of 2005 showed further increase in expenditure \nin real terms in each major category, especially in net lending (or SETF). \n\nExpenditure Categories. Between 2001 and 2004, total expenditure on education30 has \n6. \non average comprised 92% recurrent expenditure, 5% capital expenditure, and 3% net lending. \nRecurrent expenditure consists of three main categories: (i) personnel costs (an average 51.6% \nof  total  recurrent  expenditure  between  2000  and  2004),  which  include  salaries  and  wages, \nallowances, and social security or insurance schemes paid by the employer; (ii) other goods and \nservices (46.8%) including fixed costs and food; and (iii) subsidies and transfers (1.7%). \n\n7. \nAt  the  institutional  level,  these  proportions  are  less  balanced.  Fixed  costs  include \nelectricity,  heating,  transport  and  fuel,  and  water  supply  and  treatment\u2014in  a  country  with \nextremely  harsh  winters  where  heating  costs  are  high.  Food  is  also  an  important  item  of \n                                                 \n29 Since SETF is devoted to providing grants and loans to higher education students, and since there are problems in \nrecovering debts, it might make sense to include net lending under higher education. This would increase higher \neducation\u2019s  share  in  2004  to  19%  and  reduce  the  share  of  other  expenditure  (including  additional  sectoral \ninvestment) to 12%. \n\n30 The  year  2000  was  unusual  in  that  recurrent  expenditure  was  98%  of  total  public  expenditure  on  education  with \n\ncapital expenditure and net lending being approximately 1% each. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nexpenditure,  where  every  effort  is  made  to  encourage  children  (particularly  from  nomadic \nfamilies)  to  attend  school  by  providing  dormitory  accommodation  with  state-financed  food.  A \nfixed  amount  of  funding  for  each  pupil  is  allocated  to  each  school  with  a  dormitory.  The \nEducation  Law  provides  for  a  further  fixed  cost\u2014an  extra  year\u2019s  salary  for  each  teacher  on \nretirement after 25 years\u2019 service\u2014which is allocated to the relevant schools. All other items31 of \nrecurrent expenditure are classed as variable costs. Recurrent expenditure on selected costs is \ndescribed in Figure A4.1. \n\nFigure A4.1: Average Share of Recurrent Expenditure of Selected Costs by  \nSubsector, 2000\u20132004 \n\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n70.0\n\n60.0\n\n50.0\n\n40.0\n\n30.0\n\n20.0\n\n10.0\n\n0.0\n\nPersonnel\nHeating \nFood \nO&M\n\nOther\n\nKindergarten \n\nVTE\n\nHigher\n\nSector \n\nPrimary \nand \nSecondary\n\nO&M = operation and maintenance, VTE = vocational and technical education. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and World Bank estimates. \n\n8. \nAs  a  proportion  of  recurrent  expenditure  in  the  sector,  personnel  costs  are  51.6%, \nheating is 15.3%, food is 6.3%, and maintenance is 2.4%. However, in kindergartens, heating \nand food together are 39.2% of recurrent expenditure and, in primary and secondary schools, \nthe proportions are skewed towards personnel costs at 64.1% and heating at 18.6%. In the VTE \nsubsector,  an  average  of  5.4%  of  recurrent  expenditure  has  been  devoted  to  maintenance  as \nthe  subsector  relies  heavily  on  capital  equipment;  its  other  major  costs  are  for  training  and \npractice  expenses  (8.4%).  For  higher  education,  other  major  costs  are  also  for  training  and \npractical  expenses  (9.5%),  and  payment  for  services  provided  by  the  private  sector  (10.5%), \nwhich effectively means personnel costs. \n\n \n\n9. \nIf  we  consider  variable  costs  only  (i.e.,  excluding  fixed  costs  and  food),  kindergarten \npersonnel  costs  were  81.4%  of  variable  costs  (including  subsidies  and  transfers)  in  2004;  \ngeneral  secondary  personnel  costs  were  86.5%;  and  VTE  personnel  costs  were  59%.  For \nhigher  education,  personnel  costs  were  61.5%  of  the  equivalent  of  variable  costs  in  2003.  In \n2004, this was reduced to 2.9% as personnel costs were transferred to services provided by the \nprivate sector line. \n\n10. \nAt primary and secondary levels in particular, 14.5% of variable costs does not appear to \ncover the true cost of the day-to-day running of the school and the purchase of quality inputs, \n\n                                                 \n31 Including  workshops  for  teachers,  stationery,  materials,  communication  expenses,  minor  facilities  and  furniture \n\nrepairs and maintenance, and uniforms for nonteaching support staff. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nincluding  teaching  and  learning  materials  and  equipment  over  and  above  textbooks  and  in-\nservice teacher training (professional development). \n\n11. \nFinancing  Primary  and  Secondary  Education:  Expenditure  by  Aimag  and  Unit \nCosts  per  Student.  Variable  costs  differ  from  region  to  region,  from  aimag  to  aimag,  and  in \ncomparison with Ulaanbaatar. Region by region, the proportion of students is roughly similar to \nthe proportion of total recurrent expenditure, with Ulaanbaatar\u2019s costs being less (28.4%) than \nits  proportion  of  students  (33.4%).  The  same  can  be  said  for  fixed  costs,  except  that \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s fixed costs are proportionately lower than for each of the regions; it is here that \nthe  majority  of  double  shift  and  triple  shift  schools  operate,  thus  reducing  the  fixed  cost  per \nstudent, at least. However, when the unit considered is the school rather than the student, the \nrelationship between the proportion of fixed costs and the proportion of schools in each region is \nnot so disparate. With food, the Western Region has a lower proportion of costs (37.1%) than \nstudents  living  in  dormitories  (42.4%).  Finally,  with  variable  costs,  the  proportions  of  students \nand  costs  are  roughly  similar,  with  the  Western  Region  being  slightly  more  expensive  and \nUlaanbaatar slightly less expensive. \n\n12. \nHowever, when we consider per student unit costs (for total recurrent expenditure, food, \nfixed  costs,  and  variable  costs),  there  are  great  differences  between  regions,  aimags,  and \nUlaanbaatar.32  In  all  cases,  the  Southern  Region  had  the  highest  per  student  costs,  and \nUlaanbaatar had the lowest. \n\n13. \nPer  dormitory  student  food  costs  were  on  average  MNT88,720,  ranging  from \nMNT35,626  in  Ulaanbaatar,  MNT49,474  in  Zavkhan  aimag  (Western Region),  to MNT131,202 \nin  Gobisumber  aimag  (Southern  Region).  Per  student  variable  costs  averaged  MNT88,270, \nranging from MNT83,024 in Arkhangai aimag (Central Region), MNT84,120 in Ulaanbaatar, to \nMNT108,907 in Zavkhan aimag (Western Region). Variable costs also differ according to level \nof education and whether the students are boarding or not. For example, in Darkhan-Uul aimag, \nthe variable unit cost in 2005 is MNT73,000 for a primary (grades 1\u20134) student, MNT91,600 for \na lower secondary (grades 5\u20138) student, MNT99,800 for an upper secondary (grades 9\u201310/11) \nstudent,  MNT110,900  for  a  boarding  lower  secondary  student,  and  MNT118,500  for  a \nkindergarten pupil. \n\n14. \nFixed  costs  per  school  averaged  MNT19,196,347  ranging  from  MNT11,923,888  in \nZavkhan  aimag  (Western  Region),  MNT18,881,244  in  Ulaanbaatar,  to  MNT34,227,087  in \nSukhbaatar  aimag  (Eastern  Region).  Per  student \nfixed  and  variable  costs  averaged \nMNT112,562  ranging  from  MNT100,963  in  Ulaanbaatar,  MNT105,575  in  Khuvsgul  aimag \n(Northern Region), to MNT147,945 in Gobisumber aimag (Southern Region). Per student total \nrecurrent costs averaged MNT119,001 ranging from MNT101,178 in Ulaanbaatar, MNT109,898 \nin Darkhan-Uul aimag (Northern Region), to MNT160,146 in Gobi-Altai aimag (Western Region). \n\n15. \nThe Government\u2019s contribution to the Project is estimated at $4,962 million (26% of the \ntotal project cost) over 5 years. To date, provisional financial projections have only been made \nfor  2005\u20132008.  There  is  no  financial  information  for  the  years  beyond  2008,  although  work  is \ncurrently  being  carried  out  in  estimating  the  financial  framework  for  the  proposed  Education \nMaster Plan 2006\u20132015. \n\n                                                 \n32 Regional differences for each type of expenditure are illustrated in Figures 3.2\u20133.5 in the Supplementary Appendix.  \n\nIn both Table S23 and Figures 3.2\u20133.5, Ulaanbaatar is considered separately from the Central Region. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable  A4.4  shows  a  macroeconomic  framework  for  education  financing  up  to  2008, \n16. \nusing the information supplied by the MECS Education Finance study team. Assuming that the \nProject  starts  in  2006,  project  costs  (including  maintenance  costs)  for  the  Government  for  the \nfirst 3 years will be between 0.1% and 0.2% of public expenditure on education. Although public \nexpenditure on education, as a share of both GDP and total public expenditure, is expected to \ndecline from 2006 onwards, such project costs are insignificant and strongly suggest that project \nactivities supported by the Government are sustainable. However, there is need for caution in \nrespect of the proportion of government project costs allocated to maintenance, which needs to \nbe increased to finance preventive maintenance expenditures. \n \n\nTable A4.4: GDP, Total Public Expenditure, Education Expenditure, and  \nGovernment Share in the Project up to 2008 \n\nItem \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\nGDP ($ million) \nTPE ($ million) \nPEE ($ million) \nPEE as % of GDP \nPEE as % of TPE \nGovernment share in the \nProject ($ million) \nGovernment share in the \nProject as % of PEE \n\n945.4  1,016.4  1,117.5  1,274.4  1,525.5  1,615.6  1,765.1  1,898.4  2,088.5 \n704.8 \n602.3 \n398.7 \n122.8 \n115.0 \n72.1 \n5.9 \n7.5 \n7.6 \n17.4 \n19.1 \n18.1 \n\n494.1 \n89.4 \n8.0 \n18.1 \n\n446.2 \n86.9 \n8.6 \n19.5 \n\n634.9 \n120.0 \n7.4 \n18.9 \n\n686.2 \n126.7 \n6.7 \n18.5 \n\n678.0 \n142.5 \n8.1 \n21.0 \n\n537.1 \n97.1 \n7.6 \n18.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.7 \n\n0.1 \n\n1.2 \n\n0.2 \n\n1.2 \n\n0.2 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PEE = public expenditure on education, TPE = total public expenditure.  \nSources:  World  Bank,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy,  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science,  and  Project \ncosting.\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nSCHOOL FACILITIES  \n \n\nthroughout \n\n1. \nSituational Analysis of School Physical Facilities. In 2005, Mongolia had a total of \n710  public  primary  and  secondary  schools,  with  facilities  provision  in  the  order  of \nthe  6  khoros \n896 school  buildings  and  144  dormitories  distributed \n(municipalities)  of  Ulaanbaatar,  21  aimags  (provinces),  and  329  soums  (districts).  Many \nschool facilities were constructed in the 1970s or 1980s and have seriously deteriorated due to \nsevere weather conditions, continuous use, and inadequate maintenance. About 499 or 56% of \nthe school buildings are considered by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) \nto be in a very poor condition. Some 12% of secondary schools have not received any form of \nassistance for facilities improvement or replacement.  \n \nThe  896  public  school  buildings  were  designed  to  accommodate  a  total  of  around \n2. \n325,000  students.  During  the  2004\u201305  school  year,  the  total  enrollment  in  primary  and \nsecondary schools was 557,346 students\u2014about 65% more than the planned capacity. Due to \nthe  increase  in  enrollments  and  lack  of  additional  school  space,  about  43%  of  all  secondary \nschools in the country were conducting classes on two or three shifts. The shift to the 12-year \nschooling  system,  as  planned,  will  exert  increased  pressure  on  the  capacity  of  facilities. \nMigration  to  cities  has  created  overcrowding  in  urban  schools  and  underutilization  of  rural \nschool  facilities.  Some  schools  in  Ulaanbaatar  are  operating  at  an  average  of  260%  of  their \ncapacity  with  over  50  students  in  some  classes.  This  has  led  to  overuse  of  facilities  and  will \nresult in the speedy deterioration of school facilities, if not maintained properly. In  rural areas, \nmigration has generated an underutilization problem of schools, with some operating at only one \nthird of their capacity. \n \n3. \nInadequate  budget  allocation  for  preventive  maintenance  has  resulted  in  considerable \ndeterioration  of  school  buildings  and  facilities  over  the  last  15  years.  Rehabilitation  of  school \nfacilities  has  depended  largely  on  donor  support.  The  finance  allocated  for  maintenance  of \nschool  facilities  has  been  inadequate.  Maintenance  is  only  2.4%,  as  a  proportion  of  the \nrecurrent expenditure in the education sector. From 2000 to 2003, the Government\u2019s provision \nfor maintenance and repair of buildings was only MNT17,592 million ($14.84 million) compared \nwith MNT34,335 million ($28.97 million) from aid agencies.  \n \n4. \nSustaining the physical condition of rehabilitated school facilities needs to be addressed. \nFinancial  data  obtained  from  44  sample  schools  rehabilitated  under  the  Second  Education \nDevelopment  Project  (SEDP)  showed  actual  expenditures  on  repairs  and  maintenance  to  be \nonly  MNT2,735,352  ($2,308)  per  school  in  2002  (prior  to  rehabilitation)  and  MNT2,194,230 \n($1,852) in 2004 (after rehabilitation). Based on selected reviews of sample schools, the budget \nfor repairs and maintenance should be at least $3,766 to $4,000 per year per building or $673 \nper student. \n \n5. \nThe  inflexibility  of  the  government  budgeting  system\u2014where  savings  from  any  of  the \nschool  budget  expenditure  items  are  reverted  back  to  the  national  consolidated  revenue\u2014\nleaves  no  flexibility  for  schools  to  utilize  savings  from  other  budget  allocations  for  urgently \nneeded school repairs and maintenance. However, from 2006, schools with genuine savings will \nbe  allowed  to  retain  the  level  of  their  budget  allocation  for  the  following  year  similar  to  the \nprevious  year  without  penalty.  A  number  of  schools  have  been  piloted  with  this  reform  from \n1 July 2005. \n \n6. \nInefficient  Teaching  and  Learning  Environment  due  to  Poor  Physical  Facilities. \nMECS  has  identified  about  200  schools  that  no  longer  provide  the  basic  requirements  of  an \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nappropriate teaching and learning environment and that need urgent repairs. The buildings are \nover  20  years  old,  with  old  and  inefficient  building  construction  and  heating  technology,  and \nunacceptable  sanitation.  In  particular,  the  outdated  heating  technology  generates  high  utility \ncosts. Heating remains a major issue, with 10% of schools still using ordinary stoves for heating \nclassroom  buildings.  As  a  result,  classroom  and  dormitory  temperatures  often  drop  to  below \nzero  with  temperatures  plummeting  to  minus  30  degrees  centigrade  during  extremely  harsh \nwinters. The heating system of the majority of school buildings is usually linked with other public \nbuildings to a heating distribution system without proper metering and control of consumption. \nLeaking  roofs,  water  infiltration  to  the  building  structures,  damaged  and  leaking  windows  and \ndoors  with  poor  insulation,  defective  wooden  floors,  malfunctioning  sanitary  and  plumbing \nfacilities, and leaking water supply lines were major defects common to all the school buildings \nand would need to be repaired/rehabilitated soon to avoid further deterioration. The motivation \nof  even  dedicated  teachers  under  poor  working  conditions\u2014in  particular  in  rural  schools\u2014\nwanes in the long run. Students and teachers tend to transfer to schools where the educational \nfacilities and learning environment are better. Enrollment data from schools rehabilitated under \nSEDP showed increased enrollments after school rehabilitation. \n \n7. \nDeclining  enrollment  and  attendance  rates  as  well  as  poor  quality  of  education\u2014\nparticularly in rural areas\u2014can be attributed in part to the poor condition of school infrastructure \nand facilities, dilapidated furniture, lack of equipment, and failing heating systems. During harsh \nwinter  conditions,  students  and  teachers  are  forced  to  remain  home,  especially  when \nclassrooms become extremely cold due to poor heating systems. Some schools have to close \noccasionally due to this condition. Poor families cannot afford to buy the minimum clothing and \nshoes  for  their  children  during  winter.  Therefore,  the  poorest  pupils  are  not  able  to  attend \nclasses  because  classrooms  can  be  extremely  cold  and  children  cannot  withstand  freezing \ntemperatures during the coldest periods in winter. The condition of educational facilities has the \ngreatest negative impact on access for disabled and vulnerable students. Old school facilities do \nnot have the necessary provisions and services to meet the needs of these special groups. \n \n8. \nMECS  has  been  advocating  student-centered  approaches  to  teaching  in  instructional \nprograms  to  improve  the  traditional  \"chalk  and  blackboard\"  method.  But  efforts  towards \nachieving this goal have been hampered, in part, by the lack of appropriate equipment needed \nto prepare and produce learning materials to make the student-centered learning process more \ninteresting and effective during class sessions.  \n  \n9. \nOutdated  Science  Laboratory  Equipment.  Of  6,355  secondary  schools,  some \n347 schools  do  not  have  the  basic  equipment  for  science  laboratories.  The  equipment  was \nsupplied during the Soviet era, is obsolete, and is no longer used for conducting experiments. \nFlasks, chemicals, and instruments used for conducting experiments in chemistry and physics \nare  no  longer  suitable.  Without  basic  laboratory  equipment,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  conduct \nexperiments for science subjects, as required by the new curriculum framework.  \n  \n10. \nShortage of Classroom Computer Equipment for IT-assisted Learning. The general \nlack of up-to-date classroom computer equipment deprives many students from learning basic \ncomputer  operations  and  software  applications  vital  to  IT-assisted  learning  and  for  conducting \nbasic research work through the internet. Beginning in the 2005\u20132006 school year, informatics \nwill be taught with mathematics from grades 6\u201310. Learning the practical aspects of informatics \nwill require the use of computers, which should be made available in the schools. In the majority \nof schools, however, computer equipment is obsolete, not functioning, or not available at all.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nSELECTION CRITERIA FOR SCHOOLS TO BE REHABILITATED \n\nAs  agreed  with  the  Government,  candidate  schools  to  be  selected  for  rehabilitation \n\n \n1. \nunder the proposed project will meet the following criteria.  \n \n\nSchools  have  been  identified  as  priority  schools  by  both  Ministry  of  Education, \nCulture  and  Science  (MECS)  and  the  relevant  provincial  administration  and  are \nnot  included  in  any  future  assistance  program  on  facilities  expansion  or \nrehabilitation from any other agency. \n\nSchools have a minimum of 30% of enrolled students from poor families33 at the \ntime of selection. \n\nSchools have sufficient qualified teachers.  \n\nSchool  management  and  MECS  provide  evidence  that  adequate  budget  will  be \nmade available for preventive maintenance after rehabilitation. \n\nParents  from  the  community  and  teachers  are  willing  to  be  actively  involved  in \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  and  in  supervising  and  monitoring  school \nrehabilitation works. \n\nAll sites and facilities will be selected subject to Asian Development Bank concurrence. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n2. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n33  Poverty  in  Mongolia  is  defined  using  the  minimum  living  standards  approach.  Currently,  the  poverty  line  is \nMNT19,500\u201325,000 ($17\u201321) per capita per month, depending on the region (ADB. 2004. Outlook 2004. Manila). \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nVOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION \n\nFormal VTE System under MECS \n\n \n1. \nThe  sole  public  provider  of  vocational  and  technical  education  (VTE)  for  youth  is  the \nMinistry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science  (MECS).  Vocational  and  technical  training  and \nretraining  for  adults  is  offered  by  institutions  under  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Welfare \n(MLSW), other line ministries, and the private sector. Overall, the VTE system is supply-driven, \nfragmented,  and  poorly  coordinated.  Industry  involvement  is  weak,  hence  the  majority  of \nprograms are not relevant and do not respond to the needs of industry. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe provision of VTE for youth is the responsibility of MECS. The VTE system caters to \nyouths  who  have  at  least  completed  grade  8  or  are  about  15  years  of  age.  Most  students \nenrolled in VTE institutions are from lower-middle income families or families below the poverty \nline.  MECS  administers  a  total  of  42  VTE  institutions.  There  are  22  vocational  education  and \ntraining centers (VETCs)/vocational training and production centers (VTPCs), which offer a 2.5-\nyear  school-based  vocational  education  that  combines  professional  and  general  education, \nleading  to  a  professional  and  secondary  education  certificate.  School-based  vocational \neducation  started  in  1965  on  a  50:50  theory-practice  ratio  that  includes  30\u201335%  general \neducation,  5\u201320%  basic  vocational  theory,  and  50\u201355%  practice,  which  is  not  carried  out  at \npresent  because  of  lack  of  appropriate  training  equipment.  Curriculum  model  standards  are \nprepared  by  MECS,  subject  to  approval  by  the  Mongolian  Agency  for  Standardization  and \nMetrology.  However,  the  vast  majority  of  graduates  from  the  combined  general-vocational \neducation  system  cannot  compete  with  the  academic  performance  of  graduates  from  the \ngeneral secondary education stream and do not find jobs in industry due to lack of employable \nskills.  In  addition,  the  social  status  of  vocational  education  is  very  low,  as  the  majority  of \nstudents are weak performers in the basic education grades and come from poor families.  \n \nMECS  also  administers  14  branch  schools  (or  schools  attached  to  higher  education \n3. \ninstitutions)  and  6  technical  colleges,  which  provide  technical  education  for  higher-level  skills \ndevelopment, leading to a professional diploma or bachelors degree. Technical education is a 2-\nyear  advanced  training  after  completion  of  grade  10.  This  system  started  in  1996  by  shifting \nfrom  the  1-year  specialized  vocational  education  program  to  the  2-year  advanced  training, \nleading  to  a  professional  diploma.  The  diploma  program  can  be  linked  with  higher  education \nafter 2 years, leading to a bachelors degree. The aim of vocational education is to provide basic \noccupational  skills  and  knowledge  in  a  chosen  vocation  while  the  objective  of  technical \neducation is to develop higher-level skills in a range of occupations and jobs in a given industrial \nsector. \n \n4. \nThe  number  of  VTE  institutions  has  increased  from  36  in  2001  to  42  in  2005.  VTE \nstudents  as  a  proportion  of  all  students  in  grades  1\u201310  declined  from  11%  in  1987  to  4%  in \n2004. However, enrollment in VTE institutions increased from 12,177 in 2000 to 21,911 in 2004, \nof  which  49.5%  were  female.  About  144  vocational  and  technical  courses  are  offered  by  VTE \ninstitutions. A total of 117 courses deal with basic training or professional certificate courses in \noccupations such as cooking and bakery, food production, caf\u00e9 and restaurant services, sewing, \nbeauty  culture,  carpentry  and  wood  processing,  secretarial,  farming,  painting,  consumer \nelectronics, shoe  repair,  photo  studio  operator,  and  hotel  and  restaurant  services. Most  of  the \ncourses were designed without any labor market survey or active participation by industry. \n \n5. \nSome  27  courses  are  offered  as  areas  of  specialization  in  the  technical  education \nprogram\u2014related  to  auto  mechanics,  computer  technicians,  heavy  equipment  operation  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nNonformal Vocational Training under MLSW \n\nrepair,  food  production,  advertisement,  mining,  sewing,  electrical  technicians,  construction, \npublic  nutrition,  archive  documentation,  music,  dance,  and  singing.  The  diploma  courses  with \nhigh  social  demand  are  sewing  technique,  computer/electronics,  computer  operator,  auto \nmechanics,  secretarial,  and  driving.  In  general,  courses  do  not  mirror  new  and  emerging \ntechnologies for developing highly skilled workers and technicians to meet the manpower needs \nof  a  gradually  diversifying  economy.  The  course  titles  do  not  provide  clear  distinction  on  the \nlevels of technology. \n \nThere were 8,338 VTE graduates in 2004, of which almost 53% was female. No reliable \n6. \ntracer  information  is  available  to  assess  whether  graduates  found  employment.  However, \nconsultations with industry representatives revealed that only a very small number of graduates \nfound  direct  employment  due  to  lack  of  relevant  knowledge  and  skills.  Many  graduates \nparticipate  in  short-term  courses  offered  through  MLSW  to  increase  their  employment  and \nincome-earning opportunities.  \n \n7. \nAlthough vocational education is a development priority of the Government, the current \nbudget  allocation  for  VTE  is  inadequate  to  ensure  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  programs. \nFor  2004,  the  budget  allocation  for  formal  VTE  was  about  4%  of  the  education  budget.  There \nwas only incremental budget increase for the last 15 years, which is way below the international \naverage level of expenditure. There was no allocation for capital expenditure since 2004.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nMLSW  is  the  main  provider  of  vocational  training  in  the  form  of  short-term  courses  to \ntrain  and  retrain  adults.  There  are  no  strict  entry  qualifications  for  taking  up  training  courses. \nParticipants  include  unemployed  adults,  secondary  school  leavers,  soldiers,  and  adults  who \nneed  retraining  or  skills  upgrading.  Short-term  training  is  carried  out  by  private  and \nnongovernment training providers. About 358 vocational training centers (VTCs) were registered \nwith MLSW to cater to adult training. Courses are mostly designed to cater to the service sector, \nsuch  as  training  of  hairdressers,  cooks,  accounting  assistants,  cosmetologists,  waitresses, \nreceptionists,  salesgirls,  sewers,  textile  workers,  electricians,  computer  operators,  welders, \ncarpenters, bricklayers, and interior and exterior decorators. The training duration ranges from \n1 to 3 months. \n \n9. \nThe total number of unemployed persons who benefited from training at VTCs reached \n20,000  for  various  occupations.  This  represents  a  small  portion  of  the  150,000  persons  who \nregistered for training in 2004. However, courses offered are highly redundant and produce an \noversupply of trained persons, particularly in the service sector.  \n \nC.  \n \n10. \nOne  serious  issue  in  VTE  is  the  need  to  rehabilitate  and  modernize  facilities  and \nequipment.  Due  to  years  of  inadequate  maintenance  and  investment,  school  buildings  have \nseriously deteriorated (including heating, electricity, and water and sanitation systems). Old and \ninefficient  building  construction  and  heating  technology  generate  high  utility  costs.  The  lack  of \nappropriate  equipment,  adequate  teaching  aids,  and  learning  materials  constrains  applying \nmodern  teaching  methodologies.  The  quality  of  hands-on  skills  training  is  seriously  hampered \nby outdated training equipment, and lack of consumables and tools.  \n \n \n\nCondition of Training Facilities \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nQuality of Teaching and Delivery \n\nD. \n \n11. \nThere were 1,160 teachers and trainers employed in the 42 VTE institutions in 2004, of \nwhich about 63% are female. The teacher-student ratio was 1:19, which is considered an ideal \nsize. About one third of teachers in service are general education teachers. Most of the teachers \nhave  bachelors  degree  and  about  1\u20135  years\u2019  experience,  which  is  indicatively  short.  The \npedagogical and technical skills and knowledge of many teachers are outdated and need to be \nupgraded. There is a lack of pre-service and in-service teacher education programs for technical \nVTE  teachers.  The  delivery  of  training  is  conventional  and  classroom-based,  with  little \nopportunity to develop practical skills due to lack of up-to-date equipment and training supplies. \nThere is an acute shortage of learning resources. Most of the textbooks and resource materials \nare  seriously  outdated,  with  no  systematic  library  management  system  in  place.  There  are  no \nmultimedia  facilities  or  even  classroom  computers  available  to  apply  modern  teaching  and \nlearning methods. \n \n12. \nCurrently, there is no comprehensive recognized national system for skills standards in \nplace. The quality of skills training depends on the quality of instruction, which is often adversely \naffected  by  the  lack  of  training  materials  and  equipment,  and  poor  teaching  environment  and \noutdated  knowledge  of  teachers.  VTE  institutions  set  their  own  examination,  without  formal \nexternal quality control or moderation. The industry is only involved occasionally. \n \nE. \n\nMarket  Orientation  and  Cooperation  to  Strengthen  Relevance  and  Demand \nOrientation \n\n \n13.  MECS\u2019  VTE  system  is  suffering  from  weak  interaction  with  industry,  poor  coordination \nwith  MLSW  and  other  training  providers,  and  lack  of  an  elaborate  labor  market  assessment \nstrategy to design programs of economic and social relevance. VTE is largely supply-driven and \nnot significantly refocused to reflect the emerging needs of the labor market. The current labor \nmarket information system is unable to provide up-to-date labor market data to guide the design \nand revision of training programs. The lack of information and resource sharing among MECS, \nindustry,  and  other  training  providers  lowers  the  quality  and  relevance  of  training  programs. \nMECS needs to improve strategies to explore ways to involve industry participation.  \n \nA  review  of  courses  offered  under  MECS  and  MLSW  will  be  necessary  to  clearly \n14. \ndelineate  and  calibrate  the  type  and  level  of  courses  offered  by  each  ministry  to  avoid \nduplication  of  resources  and  redundancy  of  programs.  Moreover,  there  is  a  need  to  cluster \ncourses  into  major  occupational  groups  to  warrant  international  classification  of  training, \nfacilitate  standard  setting  and  international  benchmarking,  and  for  economy  of  scale  in \nequipment provision and maintenance.  \n \n15. \nThe  present  curricula  have  not  been  seriously  updated  in  the  past  and  need  major \nredesigning  to  conform  to  the  new  national  curriculum  framework.  There  are  only  16  training \nstandards,  which  were  developed  from  1998  to  date  for  sewers  and  tailors  of  soft  items;  food \nproduction,  cooks  and  bakers;  electric  and  gas  welders;  carpenters;  plumbers  and  welders; \nmechanics  and  drivers;  shoemakers;  farmers;  hairdressers  and  beauticians;  construction \nmasonry workers; general vocation in mining, repair and maintenance of mining equipment and  \ndrivers  of  heavy  load  machinery.  These  training  standards  appear  too  basic  and  almost \nduplicate  the  short-term  courses  at VTCs.  There  is  a  need  to  recalibrate  these  standards  and \nintroduce  new  ones  for  multiskilled  development  rather  than  simple  operation  work.  Some \nconstraints are the lack of an elaborate labor market survey and tracer studies, as well as the \ncapacity and resources to undertake curriculum revision. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\nReform Needs \n\nframework  needs \n\nlegal,  regulatory,  and \n\nF.  \n \n16. \nThere is a need to develop a comprehensive national policy linked to a national human \nresource development plan and the present and future labor market. The current VTE system \nunder  MECS  needs  to  be  reformed,  particularly  addressing  challenges  related  to  (i)  adjusting \nVTE  programs  to  the  reformed  national  curriculum  framework  and  the  extended  grade  1\u201312 \nschool  structure  (including  amending  student  entry  levels  and  qualification  requirements); \n(ii) addressing challenges related to the revision of the current 2.5-year combined professional \nand general education program; (iii) developing new profiles for VETCs/VTPCs, focusing on the \nprovision  of  relevant  demand-driven  vocational  education  programs  for  skilled  labor;  (iv) \ndeveloping  a  demand-driven  curriculum  in  close  cooperation  with  industry,  based  on  market \nsurveys  and  internationally  accepted  standards;  (v)  assessing  training  needs  for  vocational \nteachers and developing an in-service teacher training system; and (vi) reviewing diploma and \nbachelors programs to improve demand orientation.34 \n \n17. \nA reformed VTE system needs to be in line with policies, regulations, and standards of \nall  training  providers  to  strengthen  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  entire  system.  A \nnational  policy \ninstitutional \nto  (i)  streamline \narrangements  for  the  subsector;  (ii)  define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  major \nstakeholders; (iii) agree on national skills standards; and (iv) prepare for a National Vocational \nQualification (NVQ) system based on standards of competence set by industry.  \n \n18. \nPublic-private  partnership  needs  to be  improved  substantially.  The  private  sector could \nplay a greater role in developing, promoting, and owning VTE. Public-private partnership in VTE \ncould build on the encouraging lessons learned from the Skills Training Voucher Program with \nsupport from the Employment Promotion Fund. However, incentives are necessary to enhance \nprivate sector participation in VTE provision.  \n \n19. \nThe  recurrent  budget  of  a  VTE  school  is  based  on  enrollment.  The  variable  cost  of \ntraining  has  been  calculated  as  one  of  the  major  parameters  in  allocating  the  budget.  The \npresent  system  of  public  budgeting  has  no  provision  for  recognizing  performance  as  an \nincentive  for  excellence.  This  is  important  to  foster  the  quality  of,  and  competition  in,  VTE \nprovision. Another major drawback of the VTE system is the lack of financial autonomy. There is \na need to initiate fiscal policy reform to improve the present financing mechanisms. \n \n20. \nThe  quality  assurance  system  in  VTE  is  weak.  The  accreditation  system  for  higher \neducation  institutions  and  vocational  and  technical  training  centers  was  embodied  in  the \nEducation Law, 1995, as amended. The Mongolian National Council for Education Accreditation \nwas established in 1998 as the national accrediting body. To date, only two vocational training \ncenters  have  been  accredited  out  of  42  VTE  institutions.  An  accreditation  system  should  be \ndeveloped  with  industry  participation  and  closely  coordinated  with  the  Mongolian  National \nCouncil  for  Education  Accreditation  to  enhance  the  present  accreditation  system.  A  NVQ \nframework does not exist in Mongolia. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n34  Japan International Cooperation Agency has indicated that it will consider providing technical assistance to support \n\nMECS in the areas of curriculum development and teacher training. \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($) \nTable A8.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category\n\nComponent \n1a \n\nComponent \n2b \n\nComponent \n3c  \n\nProject \nManagement \n\nTotal \n\nPhysical \nContingencies \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n148,420.0 \n23,900.0 \n0.0 \n172,320.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n120,000.0 \n126,080.0 \n246,080.0 \n \n0.0 \n179,250.0 \n \n47,800.0 \n14,730.0 \n14,730.0 \n0.0 \n217,800.0 \n474,310.0 \n\n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n107,550.0 \n0.0 \n430,200.0 \n537,750.0 \n \n0.0 \n5,538,000.0 \n5,538,000.0 \n \n0.0 \n \n459,000.0 \n450,000.0 \n0.0 \n909,000.0 \n \n0.0 \n117,520.0 \n117,520.0 \n \n7,500.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n7,500.0 \n\n \n\n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n70,000.0 \n70,000.0 \n \n0.0 \n66,000.0 \n0.0 \n66,000.0 \n \n1,077,000.0 \n0.0 \n1,077,000.0 \n \n1,800,000.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n72,000.0 \n1,872,000.0 \n \n0.0 \n67,200.0 \n67,200.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n59,750.0 \n0.0 \n59,750.0 \n\n \n \n\n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n \n \n\n \n148,420.0 \n23,900.0 \n70,000.0 \n242,320.0 \n \n107,550.0 \n66,000.0 \n430,200.0 \n603,750.0 \n \n1,077,000.0 \n5,538,000.0 \n6,615,000.0 \n \n1,800,000.0 \n \n459,000.0 \n450,000.0 \n72,000.0 \n2,781,000.0 \n \n120,000.0 \n310,800.0 \n430,800.0 \n \n7,500.0 \n179,250.0 \n \n47,800.0 \n14,730.0 \n14,730.0 \n59,750.0 \n217,800.0 \n541,560.0 \n\n4\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\n% \n \n\n \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n \n3.0 \n \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n3.0 \n3.0 \n \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n\nAmount \n \n\n \n3,011.4 \n717.0 \n2,100.0 \n5,828.4 \n \n3,226.5 \n1,980.0 \n12,906.0 \n18,112.5 \n \n32,310.0 \n164,700.0 \n197,010.0 \n \n54,000.0 \n \n13,770.0 \n13,500.0 \n2,160.0 \n83,430.8 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n225.0 \n5,377.5 \n \n1,434.0 \n441.9 \n441.9 \n1,792.5 \n6,534.0 \n16,246.8 \n\nItem \n\nI. \n\nInvestment Costs \nA. \n\n \n\nInstructional Materials \nTeacher guidebooks \nNew teacher manuals  \nTVET awareness campaign \nSubtotal   \n\nB.

The  TA  will  strengthen \nMECS\u2019  technical  and  management  capacity  in  strategic  planning  and  policy  analysis,  and \nenable  the  ministry  to  set  up  a  SWAp  in  the  education  sector.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is \nestimated at $210,000 equivalent, of which $55,000 is the foreign exchange cost and $155,000 \nequivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $150,000, \ncovering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  ($55,000)  and  $95,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost through the \nprovision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and  furniture  for  TA  administration;  workshop \nfacilities; and government officials\u2019 transport and allowances. The TA will be implemented over a \nperiod of 24 months, starting March 2006.  \n \nCurrently,  the  level  of  harmonization  of  donor  activities  in  the  education  sector  is  very \n2. \nlow.  Donor  funded  projects  are  not  linked  to  an  overall  policy  framework  and  are  managed \nlargely  on  an  individual  basis,  which  leads  to  increased  transaction  costs  for  MECS.  The \npriorities  of  MECS  are  not  transparent  to  regional  administrations,  educational  institutions, \ndonors,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other  stakeholders  in  the  community  that  have  an \ninterest  in  education.  The  lack  of  clear  policy  directions  and  low  coordination  level  results  in \nineffective  and  inefficient  use  of  scarce  resources  in  the  education  sector,  whether  provided \ndomestically or by donors. \n \n3. \nA  comprehensive  policy  framework  that  provides  clear  directions  for  budget  planning \nand  donor  interventions  is  a  key  precondition  for  the  establishment  of  a  SWAp  that  will  align \ndevelopment  assistance  with  country  priorities.  The  new  Education  Master  Plan  2006\u20132015, \nprepared  with  the  assistance  of  ADB,  will  provide  the  necessary  policy  structure,  leading  to \ngreater  coherence  and  improved  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  the  sector.  However,  policy \nobjectives established under the Education Master Plan will need to be prioritized and translated \ninto  operational  implementation  strategies,  annual  budget  plans  will  need  to  be  linked  to  the \nMaster  Plan,  and  a  management  information  system  needs  to  be  set  up  to  monitor  the \nachievement of policy objectives.  \n \n4. \nAt  present,  MECS  lacks  capacity  in  strategic  planning,  policy  analysis,  research,  and \nimpact oriented monitoring. There is no effective planning structure in place because (i) limited \nqualified staff is available, and (ii) data collected are not subjected to systematic analyses and \nfinancial cost indicators are not linked to institutional data. The current education management \ninformation system (EMIS) in MECS is poorly maintained and there are inefficiencies in the data \ncollection process. Statistical data is regularly collected from all levels but it appears that it is not \ndirectly  used  for  planning  and  decision  making.  Conclusions  drawn  from  the  data  are  not \nconsistent across levels of education administration. Annual reports simply present the data in \ntabular  form  with  no  analysis  or  interpretation  of  their  implications  for  the  education  sector. \nConsequently, policy analytical and evaluative research is generally not used to inform planning \nor  budgeting.  Given  this  situation,  the  development  of  an  effective  EMIS,  which  lends  itself  to \npolicy analysis and is accompanied by human capacity building, is sorely needed. An improved \nEMIS will also contribute to improve donor coordination. \n \n5. \n Based  on  the  new  Education  Master  Plan,  the  TA  will  support  MECS  in  developing \nannual  implementation  plans,  identifying  investment  priorities,  and  preparing  adequate \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nto  align  planning, \n\nmonitoring strategies to review whether policy objectives are being achieved and advise if there \nis a need for policy adjustments. The TA will assist with the preparation of annual and longer-\nterm  budget  frameworks  linked  to  the  Education  Master  Plan,  including  financial  plans  by \nregional  and  institutional  authorities,  and  the  development  of  an  improved  donor  coordination \nmechanism.  The  TA  will  help  set  up  and  train  a  team  within  MECS  that  will  regularly  conduct \nand/or  facilitate  education  research  and  policy  analysis\u2014in  cooperation  with  universities, \nresearch  institutions,  and  aid  agencies/funding  agencies\u2014to  (i)  support  informed  decision \nmaking, (ii) initiate up-to-date discussions on strategic issues leading to greater participation in \nsetting  directions  for  education  development,  (iii)  increase  transparency,  and  (iv)  complement \nMECS\u2019 monitoring and evaluation activities. \n \n6. \nThe  TA  will  assist  MECS  in  reducing  the  fragmentation  of  development  cooperation \nefforts  and  shifting  from  a  project  to  program  approach,  and  support  MECS  in  developing \nstrategies \nimplementation,  disbursement,  reporting,  and  accounting \narrangements  with  government  procedures.  This  will  reduce  transaction  costs  and  MECS\u2019 \nadministrative burden, and increase efficiency and effectiveness in the sector. Joint monitoring \nmechanisms will focus on the impact of interventions on the improvement of the quality of the \nentire education system rather than on single projects.  \n \n7. \nTA  Staffing  and  Indicative  Terms of  Reference.  The  TA will  build  capacity  in  MECS \nthrough  the  provision  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  in  the  areas  of  strategic  and \nfinancial  planning,  policy  analysis,  and  donor  coordination.  The  TA  will  also  strengthen  the \ncurrent  EMIS.  A  total  of  3  person-months  of  international  and  48  person-months  of  national \nconsulting  services  will  be  contracted  under  the  TA.  This  will  include  experts  in  the  fields  of \n(i) education  planning,  policy  analysis,  and  research;  (ii)  financial  planning  and  budgeting; \n(iii) monitoring and EMIS; and (iv) donor coordination. Consultants will be recruited individually \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  provide  office  equipment  for  up  to  $10,000,  which \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n8. \nThe  international  advisor  (3  person-months)  will  assist  MECS  in  (i)  developing  annual \nstrategic plans based on the Education Master Plan, using appropriate data analytic approaches \nfor  informing  an  annual  strategic  planning  cycle;  (ii)  identifying  key  performance  indicators  for \nmonitoring  the  strategic  planning  cycle;  (iii)  designing  a  monitoring  mechanism  to  provide \nqualitative  information  on  achievement  of  policy  objectives;  (iv)  analyzing  policies,  laws, \nregulations, and degrees related to the new Education Master Plan; and (v) and provide advise \non  capacity  building  strategies,  including  training  for  selected  staff  to  strengthen  policy \ndevelopment  and  analysis.  The  international  advisor  will  closely  work  with  the  head  of  the \nEducation Department and other key stakeholders and donors.  \n\n \nUnder  the  guidance  of  the  international  advisor,  domestic  consultants  (22  person\u2013\n9. \nmonths)  will  assist  MECS  in  (i)  policy  analysis;  (ii)  developing  implementation  strategies  for \neach subsector, based on the Education Master Plan; (iii) reviewing financial management and \ndeveloping strategies for improvement; (iv) preparing budget plans, (v) establishing a system to \nmonitor the implementation of the Education Master Plan; and (vi) conducting training on policy \nanalysis,  and  employing  decision-oriented  research  and  reporting.  Detailed  terms  of  reference \nfor  individual  consultants  and  a  joint  working  plan  will  be  prepared  by  MECS  and  the \ninternational advisor. \n \n10. \nThe TA will provide for a domestic donor coordination specialist (20 person-months) who \nwill  assist  MECS  in  establishing  an  aid  coordination  mechanism.  The  specialist  will  work  with \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nthe leadership of MECS, the International Cooperation Division in MECS, and the development \npartners.  The  specialist  will  provide  advice  on  the  establishment  of  a  database  that  includes \ninformation  on  types  of  projects  supported  by  each  donor  and  requirements  for  proposal \nsubmission,  including  deadlines,  priorities  for  support  to  the  education  sector,  and  funding \ncycles. The specialist will assist with the development of a system for timely response to donor \ndeadlines  by  MECS.  Responsibilities  will  also  include  liaison  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nEconomy as well as relevant Standing Committees of Parliament. \n \nA domestic EMIS specialist (6 person-months) will support MECS and its Monitoring and \n11. \nEvaluation Department in improving data collection and processing procedures, and developing \nstandards and guidelines for all levels of report preparation on a periodic schedule and in line \nwith the new Education Master Plan. The specialist will advise on all aspects of selection and \nprocurement  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  equipment  required  for \nstrengthening the current EMIS, according to user and system requirements. The specialist will \nassist in the selection of appropriate domestic EMIS providers and advise on the specification of \nrequirements for customization and technical support. The specialist will identify specific training \nneeds for IT staff at both MECS and Education and Culture Department levels for operation and \nmaintenance of EMIS, including database management, security, and documentation issues.  \n \n\nTable A12: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($) \n\n \n\n \n\nForeign \n\nLocal \n\nExchange  Currency \n\na.

In  implementing  these  activities,  the  Government  will \nensure  that  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  of  society  have  equal  access  to  basic  social  services,  thus \nsupporting their opportunities for employment and participation in economic activities. It means that having a \nperson  reach  satisfactory  levels  in  terms  of  education,  food  availability  and  health  is  the  prerequisite  to \nprevention of, and escaping from, poverty and vulnerability, especially inter-generational poverty.\u201d \n \nThe  Project  is  closely  related  to  national  priorities  defined  in  the  EGSPRS.  The  Project  will  upgrade  the \nquality of education at all levels by (i) modernizing the curriculum so that it is more relevant to the needs of \nsociety  and  the  economy,  (ii)  reforming  the  vocational  and  technical  education  (VTE)  system  to  become \nrelevant  and  demand-driven,  (iii)  improving  the  teaching  and  learning  environment  through  school \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  facilities,  and  (d)  improving  the  system  of  professional  development  for \nteachers. The Project will contribute towards ensuring  that educational services are accessible in all areas \n(particularly  rural  areas)  and  for  vulnerable  groups,  and  that  school  dropout  is  further  reduced,  by  (i) \nrehabilitating rural schools and those serving children living in peri-urban areas, and (b) improving dormitory \naccommodation  in  selected  areas  to  give  better  opportunities  for  children  from  herder  families  and  rural \nhouseholds to remain in school. The Project will also contribute towards strengthening management capacity \nat  central  and  aimag  (province)  level  by  improving  capacity  in  policy  planning  and  analysis  through  the \nassociated technical assistance (TA).  \n \nSupported by the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP)1 and the Second Education Development \nProject  (SEDP),2  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science  (MECS)  has  contributed  to  reduce \ndeprivation  poverty  by  increasing  access  to  education  in  areas  with  the  lowest  enrolment  rates  (including \nrural areas and principal urban areas), and reducing income and deprivation poverty by improving access to \nquality preschool and basic education in poorer rural and urban areas. In addition, the Social Security Sector \nDevelopment  Project  (SSSDP),3  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  has  a  component \ndedicated to skills training and entrepreneurship development for the adult unemployed and poor. \n \nThe  Project  will  build  upon  the  successes  of  ESDP  and  SEDP,  as  well  as  SSSDP,  to  reduce  poverty  by \nincreasing access  to  better  quality  education services  at  primary  and  secondary  levels,  particularly  in  rural \nand  peri-urban  areas,  and  by  improving  opportunities  for  demand-driven,  vocational  education.  In  general, \nhigher  educational  attainment  produces  greater  income-earning  potential  in  Mongolia,  since  both  the \naccessibility  of  education  and  the  quality  of  the  learning  experience  in  school  are  important  factors  in \ndetermining  school  enrolment  and  completion.  The  Project  will  contribute  substantially  to  (i)  improving \naccess  to  schooling  for  children  from  both  rural  and  urban  poor  families  (through  expanding  dormitory \nplaces), (ii) creating a healthy and stimulating environment (through improved water supply and sanitation, \nimproved facilities, more relevant curriculum, and better qualified and motivated teachers), and (iii) catering \nfor the physically disabled) learning and teaching environment.

Poverty Analysis  \nOverall,  36%  of  the  total  population  lived  in  poverty.  In  2002,  poverty  incidence  was  higher  in  rural  areas \n(43%) than in urban areas (30%); lowest in Ulaanbaatar (about 27%), where half of the population resides; \nand  highest  (51%)  in  the  Western  Region.  The  recent  World  Bank  analysis  of  the  Living  Standards \nMeasurement Survey 1998 & 2002 finds that the negative impact of poverty on a child\u2019s dropout from school \nis significant at every level of schooling\u2014even at primary level where completion rates are near universal\u2014\nand  it  has  the  largest  effect  on  upper  secondary  dropout.  Poverty  affects  children\u2019s  educational  outcomes \ndirectly (out-of-pocket and opportunity costs) and indirectly (family/parental background). Educational quality, \nas measured by examination results, is significantly lower in rural areas, and poorer soums (districts) perform \nworse than richer soums; and the quality of teaching influences parental decisions on whether to keep their \nchildren in school or not. The Government\u2019s flagship social assistance program, the Child Money Programme \n(CMP), has started providing MNT3,000 per child per month to poor households, provided that the child is \nand continues to be enrolled in school (from 1 July 2005).4  Early findings of the ADB-funded Participatory \nPoverty  Assessment  and  Monitoring  Project  indicate  that  the  MNT3,000  per  child  is  considered  to  an \nimportant source of income for very poor families, although the informal charges levied by many schools are \ntoo high for the poor, even with CMP support. However, it has been estimated that 49%5 of recipients in the \nCMP are from nonpoor families and 17% of eligible poor families are excluded.   \n \nThere  has  been  increased  migration  from  rural  areas  to  peri-urban  areas,  mainly  in  search  of  better \neducation,  health,  and  other  services;  and  income-earning  opportunities.  This  inflow  of  population  has \ncaused  overcrowding  and  high  absenteeism  in  urban  schools  (nearly  7%  of  8  year  olds  do  not  attend \nschool).  High  migration  rates  can  be  associated  with  poor  student  performance  in  schools,  fees  for \npreschools  and  boarding  facilities  are  prohibitive  for  aimag  and  soum  households,  the  indirect  cost  of \nschooling  in  relation  to  household  per  capita  expenditure  increases  significantly  for  grades  9  and  10,  and \npoorer families are underrepresented in upper secondary education in both rural and urban areas. In effect, \npoverty  is  an  important  factor  in  determining  whether  a  child  is  enrolled  in  school  or  not.  Yet,  without \nunhampered access to quality education, opportunities for earning a reasonable income and rising above the \npoverty line are restricted; indeed, graduates of at least secondary education are significantly less likely to be \npoor. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nThe  main  institutional  stakeholders  include  MECS,  aimag  authorities  (including  Education  and  Culture \nDepartments),  higher  education  institutions  (especially  those  with  an  education  department),  VTE \ninstitutions, primary and secondary schools, and kindergartens. The primary stakeholders are teachers and \nstudents. Through the Project, the structure and process of the professional development of teachers will be \nmodernized and strengthened. The principal focus of the Project will be students in primary and secondary \nschools  and  VTE  institutions.  A  number  of  international  finance  and  technical  assistance  agencies  and \nnongovernment organizations are also stakeholders in the education sector. A sector wide approach (SWAp) \nin education is currently being initiated by MECS, with Japan and ADB at the forefront. Other stakeholders \ninclude construction companies carrying out school rehabilitation of schools, and community groups who will \nsupervise the rehabilitation process.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  Project  was  designed  in  a  participatory  process  involving  major  government  and  nongovernment \nstakeholders  at  national  and  aimag  level,  school  directors  and  teachers,  community  leaders,  and \ndevelopment  partners  through  regular  consultations,  series  of  workshops,  and  presentations.  During \nimplementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities and will benefit from \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n                                                 \n4 Previously, it was provided to poor families with three or more children. \n5 World Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nthe establishment of a SWAp in the education sector. \n \nThe  Project  will  encourage  (i)  nationwide  consultation  in  the  development  of  the  new  national  curriculum \nframework;  (ii)  greater  community  participation  in  supervising  and  ensuring  the  quality  of  (a)  school \nconstruction  work  and  equipment  procurement,  and  (b)  school  facilities  maintenance;  and  (iii)  partnership \nbetween employers and VTE institutions in developing and delivering market-oriented training programs. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on gender: \nAccording  to  the  ADB/World  Bank  Mongolia  Country  Gender  Assessment  (2005),  girls  enrolled  in  school \noutnumber boys in every aimag, including the capital. This pattern emerged in the immediate post-transition \nperiod and continues, although the gap has narrowed in recent years. Dropout rates for boys at secondary \nlevel  are  high  among  poor  families  in  urban  areas  while,  in  rural  areas,  children  drop  out  even  at  primary \nlevel.  The  reverse  gender  gap  is  particularly  noticeable  at  higher  levels  of  education.  Women  constituted \n80%  of  students  who  had  completed  secondary  education  in  the  United  Nations  Development  Fund  for \nWomen (UNIFEM)-EGSPRS survey sample.   \n \nTo address the reverse gender gap in the school enrollment, the Project attempts to (i) incorporate learning \nmaterials that reinforce the right of all boys and girls to attend school so they can reach their full potential; (ii) \nexamine the issue of gender stereotyping through analysis of curriculum content and identify strategies for \nimproving portrayal of gender in curriculum content; (iii) provide training for teachers in techniques for dealing \nwith  presentation  of  gender  roles  and  issues;  (iv)  give  high  priority  to  matching  skills  and  educational \nachievements to employment opportunities through demand-driven vocational education; and (v) encourage \nparents  to  send  their  children  back  to  school  through  the  provision  of  improved  school  facilities,  better \ncurriculum standard, and more qualified teachers. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.  Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\nItem \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nThe  Project  will  carry  out  minor  rehabilitation  and  repairs \nwithin  existing  school  buildings  and  facilities  with  no  land \nacquisition required. A resettlement plan is not required \n\n \nAffordability  is  not  considered  a  major  concern.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  Child  Money  Programme  ensures  that  all \npoor households with school-age children are included. \n\n \nNo  labor  retrenchments  are  envisaged  as  a  result  of  the \nProject.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  complies  with \nnational labor legislation. \n\n \nThe Project is not expected to have any adverse effects on \nindigenous people. \n\n \nNo  other  social  risks  are  anticipated  as  a  result  of  the \nProject. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\nAffordability \n\n Not significant \n\nLabor \n\n Not significant \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n \n\n Significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 18 May 2006) \ntogrog (MNT) \n\u2013 \n= \n$0.000845  \n=  MNT 1,183 \n", "Currency Unit\nMNT1.00\n$1.00\n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nCCU \nCMP \nCSP \nECD \nEGSPRS \nEMIS \nESDP \nESS \nGDP \nGER \nGTZ \n \nHEI \nICT \nIIREM \nJICA \nKLA \nMDG \nMECS \nMFE \nMLSW \nNCEA \nNGO \nNVQ \nO&M \nPEE \nPIU \nPPMS \nPSC \nSEDP \nSSSDP \nSWAp \nTA \nTPE \nUNFPA \nUNICEF \nVET \nVETC \nVTC \nVTE \nVTPC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \nConstruction Client Unit \nChild Money Programme \ncountry strategy and program \nEducation and Culture Department (at aimag level) \nEconomic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy \neducation management information system \nEducation Sector Development Program \nEducation Sector Strategy \ngross domestic product \ngross enrollment rate \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation) \nhigher education institution \ninformation and communication technology \nInnovating Rural Education in Mongolia \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nkey learning area \nMillennium Development Goal \nMinistry of Education, Culture and Science \nMinistry of Finance and Economy \nMinistry of Labor and Social Welfare  \nNational Council for Education Accreditation \nnongovernment organization \nNational Vocational Qualification \noperation and maintenance \npublic expenditure on education \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance management system \nproject steering committee \nSecond Education Development Project \nSocial Security Sector Development Project \nsector wide approach \ntechnical assistance \ntotal public expenditure \nUnited Nations Population Fund \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund \nvocational education and training \nvocational education and training center \nvocational training center \nvocational and technical education \nvocational training and production center \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "aimag \nsoum \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Administrative unit: provincial level \nAdministrative unit: village or district level \n", " \n \nGLOSSARY \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n", "C.
