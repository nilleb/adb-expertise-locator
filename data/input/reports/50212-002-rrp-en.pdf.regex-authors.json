THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ncontingent disaster financing (CDF) facility to the Cook Islands for the Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 2).  \n \n2.  The proposed program will support policy actions in disaster risk management (DRM) and \nprovide a source of CDF for timely disaster response and early recovery activities. This is the \nsecond phase of the Disaster Resilience Program approved in December 2016 for the Cook \nIslands to help manage the fiscal risk arising from disasters triggered by all types of natural \nhazards.1 Since the facility is being provided pursuant to the CDF option under policy-based \nlending of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), ADB will only provide financing under the facility \nfollowing a natural hazard event that occurs during the facility availability period and leads to the \ndeclaration of a state of disaster in the Cook Islands; or at the end of the facility availability period \nif all conditions for exercise of the deferred disbursement option have been met. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development context. The Cook Islands is a Polynesian island nation located midway \nbetween French Polynesia and Niue. It consists of 15 islands with a land area of 67 square \nkilometers spread across 2 million square kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean. About 75% of \nits 17,400 inhabitants live on the largest island of Rarotonga. The Cook Islands depends heavily \non natural resources for economic activities. Until the 1970s, the economy was dominantly \nagriculture based, but now tourism contributes about 60% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP). The economy grew by 8.9% in fiscal year (FY) 2018, supported by continued strong \ngrowth in tourism and construction activity on large infrastructure projects in renewable energy, \nwater supply and sanitation, and information and communication technology sectors.2 GDP \ngrowth is expected to ease as tourism and public investment growth slows but will remain positive \nin the near term. Public debt\u2014equivalent to 22.0% of GDP as of FY2018\u2014remains well below \nthe official threshold (35.0%), and a debt sustainability analysis carried out by ADB points to a \nlow risk of external debt distress. However, any sudden and severe shock can overturn fiscal \nbuffers.3 \n \n4.  Disaster risk. The Cook Islands is highly vulnerable to climate change and disaster \nimpacts,  particularly  coastal  erosion  and  inundation,  droughts,  flooding,  tropical  cyclones, \nincreasing  temperatures,  changing  ocean  currents,  and  abnormal  weather  patterns.  It  has \nperiodically experienced major tropical cyclones with associated high winds, storm surges, and \nflooding, which caused substantial economic damage and loss of life. The country\u2019s high exposure \nto disasters arises from (i) its geographic location in the South Pacific cyclone belt; (ii) the \nremoteness and low-lying nature of many of its islands; and (iii) the proximity of many buildings, \ninfrastructure assets, and services to the coast, especially on Rarotonga. The small, narrowly \nbased economy and heavy reliance on a hazard-sensitive sector such as tourism makes the Cook \nIslands particularly vulnerable to natural hazards, which are likely to disrupt economic activity, \n \n1  ADB. 2016. Cook Islands: Disaster Resilience Program. \n2   ADB. 2019. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2019 Update. Manila. \n3  Macroeconomic Assessment Summary: Cook Islands (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nThe Cook Islands is not an International Monetary Fund member, and therefore ADB has prepared a macroeconomic \nassessment summary in lieu of the International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter. \n \n ", "2 \nlead to loss of livelihoods and income, and undermine the fiscal position of the government. The \ndisaster risk was highlighted in 2005, when the country experienced five consecutive cyclones \nwithin 2 months, including four category 5 storms, which caused damages estimated at $10.0 \nmillion.4 Annual GDP growth fell from 2.2% in 2004 to \u20131.1% in 2005, before recovering to 5.0% \nin 2006. Previously, Rarotonga had been extensively damaged by Cyclone Sally in January 1997, \nand in November of the same year, Cyclone Martin destroyed about 90% of houses and killed 19 \npeople on Manihiki atoll. The most recent major tropical cyclone, in 2010, damaged 78% of \nhouses in Aitutaki, devastated crops, and disrupted tourism.5 The average quarterly GDP growth \nof 0.8% in 2009 dropped to \u20132.7% before recovering to 0.7% in 2011. \n \n5.  Government response and development partner coordination. To better manage the \nfiscal  risks  associated  with  disasters,  the  government  set  up  the  Cook  Islands  Disaster \nEmergency Trust Fund in 2011,6 to which it contributes regularly. The fund now has reserves of \nNZ$1.7 million (2019). The Cook Islands also joined the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment \nand Financing Initiative in 2013 and has since participated in the insurance scheme under the \nPacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company, purchasing annual insurance cover disasters \nstarting from 1-in-10-year events, using its own funds for the $100,000 annual premium. The \nmaximum insurance payout would be $2.7 million, but the Cook Islands has not experienced a \ndisaster triggering a payout. Despite its efforts to strengthen financial resilience to disasters, the \ngovernment would be unlikely to have sufficient resources in the event of a significant disaster to \nmeet immediate post-disaster needs through its budgetary reserves, disaster emergency trust \nfund, and insurance; it would instead rely heavily on budget reallocations, which can take time to \nsecure and will often redirect funds away from development priorities.7 Therefore, the Cook \nIslands was the first country in the Pacific to set up an arrangement for contingent financing for \ndisasters, through the first phase of the Disaster Resilience Program (footnote 1). \n \n6.  In addition to taking steps to reduce financial exposure to disaster risk, the government \nhas taken important steps to improve the country\u2019s resilience to disasters by establishing strong \npolicy and institutional arrangements for DRM. The National Sustainable Development Plan, \n2016\u20132020 provides the overarching framework for a DRM strategy and seeks to integrate \ndisaster and climate resilience into development processes.8 National Development Goal 13 aims \nto strengthen resilience to combat climate change and disaster impacts, particularly at community \nlevel, and by and constructing public buildings and infrastructure to cyclone-strength standards. \nA DRM Policy, approved in late 2005, called for the application of formal risk management \nprocesses to all aspects of national development planning. The 2007 Disaster Risk Management \nAct set out the institutional and organizational framework for DRM activities, but with a clear focus \non  response,  providing  guidance  on  declaring  a  state  of  disaster  or  emergency.  It  also \npromulgated the establishment of a National Disaster Risk Management Council, chaired by the \nPrime Minister, to ensure high-level oversight, policy guidance, and direction; and replaced the \nprevious National Disaster Management Office with Emergency Management Cook Islands, a \ndivision of the Office of the Prime Minister.  \n \n \n \n4  ADB. 2006.

In accordance with the 2007 DRM Act, the government put disaster management plans \nand disaster coordinators in place on the outer islands, and designated focal points in all ministries \nand agencies. Village-based DRM committees were also established in Rarotonga. The Climate \nChange and Disaster Risk Management Platform, comprising representatives of government \nagencies, nongovernment and civil society organizations, the private sector, and traditional \nleaders, meets quarterly. \n \n8.   A 10-year, NZ$288.0 million National Infrastructure Investment Plan (NIIP) was launched \nin 2015. It sets out the criteria for reducing and managing disaster and climate risks when defining \npriority infrastructure investments, as well as risk mitigation measures.9 Successive infrastructure \nplans highlighted the designation and, where necessary, construction of public buildings suitable \nas cyclone shelters. All investments are required to undergo environmental impact assessments \nin line with the 2003 National Environment Act, including an analysis of the potential impact of \nnatural hazards. The activity management cycle for investment planning, implementation, and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  Te  Tarai  Vaka,  which  is  mandatory  for  activities  in  excess  of \nNZ$150,000, identifies any major risks posed to public investments by climate variability, climate \nchange, and natural hazards, and indicates measures to address these and improve resilience. \n \n9.   Despite establishing various DRM policies and institutional arrangements, the government \nrecognizes that more could be done. The DRM gaps identified since the approval of the first phase \nof the program require: \n(i)  developing policies and action plans to step up the prioritization and expansion of \ninvestments in climate and disaster risk resilience; \n(ii)  bolstering national and local disaster management arrangements by defining roles \nand responsibilities, and operating procedures during disasters; recognizing the \nrole of women in DRM; and outlining the national structures and the agreed plans \nfor utilizing international support for disaster response; \n(iii)  undertaking regular capacity building or disaster drills nationally and locally, to \nensure the successful implementation of DRM plans during disasters; \n(iv)  strengthening resilience of infrastructure by incorporating climate and disaster \nresilience considerations into building codes; \n(v)  strengthening disaster information in various areas, such as listing contractors for \npost-disaster  response;  gathering  baseline  data  on  hazards  and  risks;  and \nidentifying climate-proofing needs and financing gaps; \n(vi)  promoting DRM initiatives that are gender responsive and child specific, i.e., that \ncater to the particular roles and vulnerabilities in communities; and \n(vii)  improving access to and management of climate and disaster finance; and fine-\ntuning  policies,  plans,  as  well  as  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and \nexpenditure to better use climate and disaster finance. \n10.   The new policy actions listed in the phase 2 policy matrix are directly tackling these gaps.10 \n \n \n \n \n \n9  Government of the Cook Islands. 2015.

ADB engagement and lessons. The Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility11 supported \nthe development of the NIIP with a stronger focus on DRM aspects (footnote 9). ADB provided \nfinancial support to the Cook Islands to assist with post-disaster recovery and reconstruction \nfollowing cyclones, including the procurement of materials and equipment, transport supplies and \npersonnel to disaster areas, civil works, and restoration of major productive activities.12 ADB often \nplays a key role in post-disaster needs assessments in the Pacific, and can provide funding for \nthe humanitarian phase through ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund, for recovery \nthrough emergency assistance loans, and for longer-term reconstruction through normal lending \nmodalities. However, emergency assistance loans can still take 3 months or more to process, and \nreconstruction loans under normal lending modalities may take significantly longer. These delays \nin  response  and  early recovery  can  exacerbate  the  indirect  economic  and social  costs  of \ndisasters, worsen their ultimate impacts, and compromise long-term fiscal balances. Therefore, \nADB has piloted contingent financing for disasters in the Pacific for the Cook Islands and Palau, \nand through the first phase of the regional Pacific Disaster Resilience Program for Samoa, Tonga \nand Tuvalu, as a mechanism to provide more timely post-disaster financing through policy-based \nloans and grants.13 On 1 August 2019, ADB formally adopted CDF as an option under its policy-\nbased lending.14 The second phase of the Pacific regional program for the Marshall Islands, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, Tonga, and Solomon Islands, all ADB concessional assistance \ncountries, was the first operation to apply the CDF option.15 \n \n12.  Contingent financing for disasters is most effective as part of a broader disaster risk \nfinancing framework, complementing other risk retention and risk transfer instruments. Contingent \nfinancing is particularly cost-effective in addressing risks pertaining to events that would exhaust \nany dedicated national reserves or contingency budgets but occur too frequently to be covered \ncost-effectively through insurance. Governments should select the most appropriate financing \ninstruments based on various factors, including funding needs, required disbursement speed, and \nrelative cost-effectiveness of alternative instruments for specific layers of risk in individual country \ncontexts. \n \n13.  Phase 1 of the Disaster Resilience Program. Phase 1 of the program for the Cook \nIslands was the first program set up in the Pacific for providing contingent financing for disasters. \nThe program was approved in December 2016 as a single-tranche, stand-alone, policy-based \nloan. Eligibility to access the funds is based on a set of prior policy actions on DRM, but actual \ndisbursement is deferred until a formal declaration of a state of disaster. Phase 1 also includes a \npost-program partnership framework (PPPF) for additional near- and medium-term target policy \nactions on DRM. The country has not experienced a major disaster to trigger disbursement of the \nloan proceeds under phase 1. The 3-year program will be completed in December 2019, and the \ngovernment has requested ADB to continue providing this financing option. \n \n11 The Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility is a multidonor technical assistance comprising ADB, the governments of \nAustralia and New Zealand, the World Bank Group (including International Finance Corporation), the European \nCommission, and the European Investment Bank. \n12 A loan of $7.1 million was provided for the economic restoration of Manihiki, Pukapuka, and Rakahanga islands after \nCyclone Martin (ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan \nto the Cook Islands for the Cyclone Emergency Rehabilitation Project. Manila); and a loan of $2.8 million and \ntechnical assistance of $0.6 million were provided after the 2005 cyclones (ADB. 2005.

Proposed program. Phase 2 of the program for the Cook Islands will be the first time that \nthe CDF option will be applied to a developing member country (DMC) only eligible to receive \nregular loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. It provides rapid access to resources to \nenable the government to initiate disaster response and early recovery efforts with minimal delay, \nmitigating a disaster\u2019s immediate economic and social impact. To establish its eligibility to access \nthe contingent financing, the government made significant progress in the phase 1 PPPF and \ncompleted new policy actions to strengthen disaster and climate risk management.  \n \n15.  The program is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, specifically its operational priority 3 \n(tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability), which supports strengthening ADB DMCs\u2019 financial preparedness for disaster \nresponse  through  policy-based  contingent  financing.16 The  program  is  consistent  with  the \nobjectives  of  the  ADB  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u22122020,  which  serves  as  ADB\u2019s  operational \nframework for the Pacific region and as the overall country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller \nPacific DMCs, including the Cook Islands.17 The Pacific Approach focuses on three strategic \nareas, one of which is managing risks, and highlights the need to (i) expand ADB\u2019s work in climate \nchange and DRM; (ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, address \nvulnerability, and build resilience; and (iii) pursue a more programmatic and regional approach to \nfinancing climate change and DRM initiatives in the Pacific region. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n16.  The policy matrix under phase 2 was developed based on progress in achieving phase 1 \nPPPF and new policy actions (Appendix 4). These policy actions are all completed, and they will \nstrengthen the disaster resilience of institutions and communities in three reform areas. \n \n17.  Reform area 1: Policy and institutional arrangements for DRM strengthened. Under \nthis reform area, the Cook Islands launched a new Climate Change Policy 2018\u20132028.18 The \npolicy aligns with other policies on crosscutting issues, such as the gender policy and the \nenvironmental and social safeguards policy; and reaffirms that climate change activities will be \ngender-responsive, participatory, and fully transparent, as well as being based on an integrated, \nmultisector approach to sustainable development. The policy includes the goal of accelerating \ngender equality, empowering all women and girls, and advancing the rights of youth, the elderly, \nand the disabled. The government also approved the second Joint National Action Plan for DRM \nand  climate  change  adaptation.19 The  plan  supports  a  whole-of-government,  all-hazards, \ncoordinated approach, closely aligned with other key national documents, such as sustainable \ndevelopment plans. It covers the related activities of all line agencies, presenting a list of wide-\nranging actions and indicators, and includes gender analysis and actions to ensure stronger \ngender responsiveness in government programs and stronger participation by women in DRM \ndecision-making. It also requires all agencies to develop gender-responsive disaster response \nplans, and includes other gender-specific commitments such as developing and resourcing a \ngender-responsive contingency plan for emergency supplies. Emergency Management Cook \nIslands and Climate Change Cook Islands, both divisions of the Office of the Prime Minister, are \njointly responsible for implementing the plan.  \n \n16 ADB. 2018.

The approved national DRM plan describes the standard operating procedures during \nemergencies.20 The DRM structure under this plan recognizes the needs of vulnerable groups \nand communities, and highlights the role of women in DRM. The new Strategic Roadmap for \nEmergency Management 2018\u20132023 identifies gaps and priority actions to strengthen DRM.21 \nThe Country Preparedness Package was finalized to outline existing national structures and the \nagreed plans for utilizing international support during a disaster, and defines the gender principles \nincorporated in the DRM structure.22  \n \n19.  In addition to completing these prior policy actions, the government strengthened national \nDRM coordination, including disaster risk reduction and preparedness, and the National Disaster \nRisk  Management  Council  has  been  holding  regular  meetings.  To  ensure  the  successful \nimplementation of the island DRM plans both nationally and locally, including in the outer islands, \ntraining sessions were held locally and at government sector agencies. DRM learning modules \nwere also distributed to schools, and training on post-disaster needs assessments is conducted \nannually.  An  online  geoportal,  established  by  Emergency  Management  Cook  Islands  in \ncoordination with the Ministry of Infrastructure and the national Meteorological Services, provides \ndatabases on housing, infrastructure, and other assets, as well as some detailed vulnerability and \nrisk mapping. \n \n20.  Reform area 2: Resilience of physical assets to disaster and climate risks improved. \nThe Cook Islands building code and its manual were also revised to incorporate climate and \ndisaster risk considerations. The climate-proofing needs of priority infrastructure are defined in \nthe NIIP, and the government has recently prepared a gender-responsive country program for \nclimate change financing. The country program promotes gender-responsive, participatory, and \ntransparent low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways. In addition to these key policy actions, the \nMinistry of Infrastructure maintains and regularly updates lists of contractors and prices, and \nservice agreements with some contractors, for emergency services. The Cook Islands Investment \nCorporation assessed all government buildings, as well as all cyclone shelters, for climate-\nproofing needs. \n \n21.  Reform area 3: Disaster risk financing expanded. To better manage the fiscal risk \nassociated with disasters, and in addition to budgetary reserves, the government continues to \nmake annual budget allocations to the Cook Islands Disaster Emergency Trust Fund. It allocated \nits own resources to the fund in the FY2018 and FY2019 budgets. In addition, since joining the \nPacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative in 2013, it participates in the second \nphase of the insurance scheme under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company. The \ngovernment allocated its own resources to the full payment of the disaster insurance premium in \nthe FY2018 and FY2019 budgets. \n \n22.  These reform areas build on progress made during phase 1 of the program, and they were \nalready identified in the  PPPF for phase 1. The implementation of the policy actions was \nencouraged through policy dialogue, which has been ongoing since phase 1. In view of the DRM \ngaps identified since the approval of phase 1 in December 2016, a new PPPF was developed for \nphase 2 (Appendix 4). It includes the government\u2019s near- and medium-term plans to strengthen \nDRM, such as developing a comprehensive land-use policy, updating the NIIP and the associated \nclimate risk assessment, revising the DRM Act, and formulating local DRM plans.

The \nMinistry of Infrastructure will continue to update the lists of contractors and service agreements \nfor emergency services. The government will keep strengthening disaster risk finance through the \nCook Islands Disaster Emergency Trust Fund and disaster insurance. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n23.  The impact is aligned with the national development goal of the National Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan\u2014resilience to combat the impacts of climate change and natural disasters \nstrengthened.23 The program is also aligned with the Framework for Resilient Development in the \nPacific, 2017\u20132030, particularly goal 1 on strengthened integrated adaptation and risk reduction \nto enhance resilience to climate change and disasters and goal 3 on strengthened disaster \npreparedness,  response,  and  recovery.24 The  most  fundamental  benefit  of  the  program  is \nimproved financial preparedness for disaster events. The program will provide a timely and \npredictable source of post-disaster financing to enable rapid decision-making and implementation \nof priority actions. This will reduce the indirect economic and social cost of direct physical losses. \n \n24.  The policy actions will ultimately result in economic benefits. In reform area 1, as a result \nof better planning and response, the benefits will include less loss of lives and property, and fewer \nnegative post-disaster health impacts. In reform area 2, benefits will include less damage to \nproperty, greater public safety, and lower costs because of shorter business and public facility \nclosures. These will result from more resilient infrastructure and assets, and faster restoration of \nessential infrastructure and services. In reform area 3, opportunity costs associated with budget \nreallocations and financial costs associated with additional borrowing will decrease, and loss of \nlives and negative health impacts will decline thanks to stronger social protection arrangements \nthat will help ensure that communities can reach safety in the event of a disaster, access sufficient \nrelief supplies for immediate needs, and receive support to rebuild their lives and assets.25 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n25.  During the initial availability period (2020\u20132022), the Cook Islands\u2019 overall development \nfinancing needs are estimated to be about 6.2% of GDP ($24.6 million) per annum, of which 5.6% \nof GDP ($22.5 million) will be mobilized from external financing. Post-disaster financing needs \nwere determined based on the likely fiscal impact of medium- and low-frequency disasters (up to \n1-in-10-year  events),  taking  into  account  the  resources  likely  available  from  domestic  and \ninternational sources, the need to ensure that the country maintains sustainable levels of debt, \nand the availability of resources. Data on historical losses related to disasters caused by natural \nhazards  is  incomplete,  but  an  analysis  undertaken  under  the  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk \nAssessment and Financing Initiative indicates that the country faces an average annual loss of \n$4.9 million from tropical cyclones alone, with probable maximum losses of $10.0 million (3.3% \nof GDP) from a 1-in-10-year event, $56.8 million (18.8% of GDP) from a 1-in-50-year event, \n$103.0 million (34.0% of GDP) from a 1-in-100-year event, and $198.1 million (65.5% of GDP) \nfrom a 1-in-250-year event.26 The program financing, $10.0 million, is less than the cost of a \ntypical medium-impact disaster in the Cook Islands. \n \n23 Goal 13 of the Cook Islands\u2019 National Sustainable Development Plan, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 8). \n24 Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 2016. Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific: An Integrated \nApproach to Address Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management, 2017\u20132030. Suva. \n25 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n26 World Bank. 2015. Country Note: The Cook Islands\u2014Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance. Washington, DC. \n \n ", "8 \n26.  The government has requested a CDF facility of NZ$15,676,00027 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. During the term of the facility, the government may \nrequest one or more loans from ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility on the terms and conditions set forth in the draft facility agreement. In accordance with the \nCDF policy pricing option 2,28 after the occurrence of a qualifying disaster, ADB and the Cook \nIslands will enter into a short-form agreement that will specify the actual loan amount requested \nby the Cook Islands, as well as the lending terms, and only then will ADB commit the requested \namount. Upon signing the short-form agreement, there will be a one-time front-end fee of 0.10% \nof the committed loan amount. If the committed funds are not fully disbursed, the undisbursed \nloan amount could be renewed for a 3-year availability period (up to four times), each time with a \nfee of 0.25% of the renewal amount (up to the undisbursed loan balance), which may be financed \nout of loan proceeds. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management will be the program\u2019s executing \nagency, and will oversee and coordinate the timely implementation of the agreed policy, legal, \nand regulatory actions. The implementing agencies will be Emergency Management Cook Islands \nand Climate Change Cook Islands, both under the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Ministry \nof Infrastructure. Eligibility to withdraw from the loan is based on achievement of prior reform \nactions, which the government implemented under phase 2 from January 2017 to 31 October \n2019. ADB will periodically monitor and encourage the continuing implementation of the policy \nactions according to the new phase 2 PPPF. \n \n28.  The program will be completed on 30 June 2023, with a renewal option up to four times of \nan  additional  3-year  period  each,  for  a  maximum  of  15  years.  The  renewal  is  subject  to \nreconfirmation  as  to  the  adequacy  of  the  macroeconomic  environment,  the  Cook  Islands\u2019 \ncontinued progress toward the PPPF, and an updated PPPF with mutually agreed objectives for \nthe subsequent availability period. The renewal may also be affected by any changes in country \nclassification during the program period.29  \n \n29.  Actual withdrawal requests will be deferred until triggered by the declaration of a state of \ndisaster in line with the 2007 DRM Act. The government can withdraw the facility proceeds \npartially or entirely, depending on its assessment of the disaster\u2019s severity and resulting need. \nOnly a single withdrawal may be requested per disaster event, and the request should be received \nby ADB within 90 days of the declaration of a state of disaster or emergency.30 Undisbursed \namounts will continue to be available during the availability period for subsequent disaster events. \nAny unutilized funds at the conclusion of the facility availability period can be disbursed to the \nCook Islands under the deferred disbursement option, subject to ADB reconfirming the Cook \nIslands\u2019 continuation of policy actions and the PPPF through submission of a progress report. \n \n \n \n \n \n27 Equivalent to $10.0 million, as of 23 October 2019. \n28 Footnote 14, paras. 28\u201329. \n29 Footnote 14, para. 26. \n30 Since the start date of a disaster event is often not clear (e.g., droughts, floods) and a declaration usually is issued \nvery shortly after a natural hazard event turns into a disaster, the declaration is used as a proxy for the disaster event.  \n \n ", "9 \n30.  Funds will be spent through national budget processes for eligible items.31 Proceeds of \nthe policy-based loans will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will periodically monitor the continuing implementation \nof the policy actions and PPPF during the availability period. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n31.  Safeguards. The program is classified as category C for the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people. Program activities are confined to policy and institutional \nreforms, and none of the activities will result in or lead to any physical works that could create \nenvironmental or social impacts, physical or economic displacement, or involuntary resettlement. \nThe activities will not negatively affect distinct and vulnerable groups of indigenous people. \nStakeholder  dialogue  was  carried  out  during  the  program  design  and  will  continue  during \nimplementation. The policy actions will improve the Cook Islands\u2019 ability to maintain greater fiscal \nstability in the event of a disaster, and to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimal delay, \nthereby mitigating the immediate economic and social impacts of a disaster. The implementation \nof the policy actions is expected to further strengthen existing social protection arrangements, \nhelping ensure that communities and vulnerable households (including households headed by \nwomen) can reach safety in the event of a disaster, access sufficient relief supplies for immediate \nneeds, and receive support to rebuild their lives and assets. \n \n32.  Gender. Women are affected by disasters in ways that are different and often overlooked. \nThe program will directly benefit them by ensuring that gender is a core component of key \nstrategic and policy documents. The first phase of the program was categorized as some gender \nelements. However, since five of the eight policy actions under phase 2 include specific gender \ncommitments,  gender  analysis,  and  targets  on  gender  actions  (paras.  17\u201320),  phase  2  is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n33.  Governance. The government\u2019s latest PFM road map for 2016\u20132020 builds on positive \nprogress  from  recent  years  and  targets  further  improvements  to  financial  management \nlegislation.32 Based  on  results  of  the  2015  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment, the road map identified key areas for improving PFM policy and legislation, including \n(i) strengthening parliamentary review of the budget, (ii) clarifying responsibilities for PFM across \nall  of  government,  (iii)  revising  processes  around  economic  and  fiscal  monitoring,  and \n(iv) managing transfers of appropriations and authorization of expenditure. A PFM bill is being \ndeveloped to address these and other areas, and achieve broader financial management and \ngovernance in the Cook Islands. The government targets the enactment of the PFM bill to take \nplace during FY2019\u2013FY2020, and its implementation to result in strengthened financial reporting, \nmonitoring, and control thereafter. \n \n34.  The Cook Islands has limited financial arrangements in place for disaster events (para. 5). \nMoreover, coordinating disaster response and early recovery, including the support offered by \ndonors and civil society organizations with competing requirements and procedures, can pose \nsignificant administrative challenges. Therefore, the government\u2019s absorptive capacities are often \nstretched in the aftermath of disaster events. Risks to program implementation relate to possible \nexternal shocks to the economy and capacity constraints in government agencies, including \nconstraints in PFM systems. \n \n \n31 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Government of the Cook Islands. 2016.

To assist the government in further strengthening the policy environment and institutional \narrangements for DRM, ADB will seek to secure funding for technical assistance that could \nsupport priority activities mutually agreed by ADB and the government. Such assistance would \nfocus on financing and budgetary issues, including post-disaster budget allocation and execution, \nto ensure that the Cook Islands has adequate systems in place to use program resources in an \neffective,  accountable,  and  transparent  manner.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 1 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.33  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nRepeated or major external shocks  Development partners support the government in improving \n(e.g., disasters and economic  resilience to economic shocks.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n37.  The government has assured ADB that the implementation of the program shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the facility \nagreement. No short-form agreement shall be made for any loan under the facility agreement \nunless (i) ADB is satisfied that a qualifying disaster event has occurred or that the conditions for \nthe deferred disbursement option have been met, and (ii) funds available for commitment and \ndisbursement under the CDF facility have been allocated by ADB for such loan. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed contingent disaster financing facility would comply with \nthe Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the contingent disaster financing facility to the Cook Islands for the Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 2) in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding NZ$15,676,000, which \ncomprises the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and is subject to such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft facility agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 November 2019 \n \n \n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nResilience to combat the impacts of climate change and natural disasters strengthened (Goal 13 of the \nCook Islands\u2019 National Sustainable Development Plan 2016\u20132020)a \n \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the       \nReform  By December 2022:    External \n    Central Policy and  shocks (e.g., \nDisaster resilience  Satisfactory rating in the National  Planning Division, Office  unexpectedly \nof institutions and  Sustainable Development Plan  of the Prime Minister  extreme \ncommunities  resilience index (on track)a  disasters or \nstrengthened  (2019 baseline: not available)b  economic \ndownturn) \ndamage the \neconomy. \n \nReform Areas  Key Policy Actions     \n       \n  By October 2019:     \n       \n1.
