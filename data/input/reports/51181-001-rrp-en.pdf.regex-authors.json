THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014Regional Emission-Reduction and Pollution-Control Facility.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project is the third in a multiyear, multisector Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) support program for air quality improvement in the greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) \nregion. The first loan, approved in 2015, focused on reforming policy and strengthening regulatory \ncapacity in Hebei province.2 The second loan, approved in 2016, targeted better access to \nfinance, especially for small and medium sized-enterprises, to scale up investments in pollution-\nreduction projects in the region.3 This third project will complement the previous projects and will \ndirectly help remove barriers to deploying high technologies that could reduce air pollution from \nindustries, urban infrastructure, and agriculture.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The greater BTH region is one of the most important economic regions in the PRC, \ngenerating about one-third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. However, it also has a high \nconcentration of people and energy-intensive and highly polluting industries, which resulted in \nwidespread air pollution.5 Cities in the greater BTH region consistently rank highest in the country \nfor high concentration of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM ) and \n2.5\nother air pollutants that contribute to the high air quality index (AQI) level.6 High levels of PM  \n2.5\nare serious health risks and can lead to premature deaths. \n \n4.  The Government of the PRC recognizes the importance of managing air pollution. In 2013, \nit launched the Comprehensive Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control (CAAP), \n2013\u20132017, which introduced the PRC\u2019s most stringent measures to reduce air pollution.7 It set \nspecific emission-reduction targets on levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, PM , and volatile \n2.5\norganic compounds nationally and for the BTH region. The government in its Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan (Thirteenth plan) further requires hundreds of cities to meet good or excellent air quality \nstandards 80% of the time and has set a cap on total energy consumption.8 In support of CAAP \n                                                \n1  The greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region refers to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, \nShandong, and Shanxi provinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n2  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n4  \u201cHigh technologies\u201d refers to technologies that have higher upfront costs but better life-cycle value than widely used \ntechnologies, or have been proven at scale in other countries but are not deployed at scale in the PRC. \n5  More than half of the PRC\u2019s pollution-intensive steel and cement production capacity, about one-third of the PRC\u2019s \ncars and other automobiles, and about 28% of the PRC population are concentrated in the greater BTH region. \n6  AQI is a common measure of the quality of air and its potential health impacts. AQI considers six atmospheric \npollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter, PM2.5, carbon \nmonoxide, and ozone. In the PRC, the AQI is categorized from 50 (excellent) to 500 (severe pollution). \n7  Government of the PRC. 2013. Comprehensive Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Beijing. \n8  Meaning they must score below 100 on the PRC\u2019s AQI. Government of the PRC. 2015. The 13th Five-Year Plan for \nEconomic and Social Development of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132020. Beijing. \n ", "2 \nimplementation, ADB contributed, targeted, and coordinated financing of $800 million (footnotes \n2 and 3) and the World Bank did the same for $1 billion. Since then, air pollution and PM\n2.5 \nconcentration levels across the BTH region have declined each year\u2014by 10.4% in 2014, 14.3% \nin 2015, and 7.8% in 2016\u2014reversing the trend of increasing air pollution in the pre-CAAP years. \nThe number of days with good AQI has also improved across the region, demonstrating the \neffectiveness of CAAP and its actions. \n \n5.  Despite this initial improvement, the annual average PM concentration level across more \n2.5 \nthan 95% of the cities in the region is still above World Health Organization and national ambient \nair quality standards.9 In the first quarter of 2017, PM levels also rebounded in the region for the \n2.5 \nfirst time since 2013 in tandem with high economic growth rates. Thus, efforts need to be \nintensified and supplemented with fundamental changes in the region\u2019s energy and industry \nstructure by adopting cleaner production methods and high technology. This is essential to \ndecouple robust economic growth from rising air pollution.10 \n \n6.  In response to CAAP, industrial enterprises chose to invest in low-cost, end-of-pipe \nmeasures instead of more advanced and cleaner technologies. The main reasons for these are \n(i) enterprises are currently prioritizing investments in end-of-pipe control measures which give \nimmediate benefits but do not address the underlying issues; (ii) enterprises\u2019 preference of \nfollowing cheaper, high-return investments in capacity expansion and diversification instead of \ncapital-intensive,  modest-return  investments  in  pollution  reduction;  (iii) limited  knowledge  of \nfinancially viable high-technology options; and (iv) absence of appropriate financing vehicles and \ninstruments to deal with associated risks. The PRC has made efforts to strengthen environmental \nmonitoring and enforcement through reform of the Environmental Protection Law. In November \n2016, it issued the Implementation Plan for the Licensing System to Control Pollutant Emission \nand announced the impending implementation of an environmental protection tax with effect from \n1 January 2018. These are in early stages of implementation, and complementary measures to \nsupport investments in pollution reduction will provide better outcomes. \n \n7.  The PRC\u2019s economic structure is gradually moving away from export-oriented industrial \ngrowth to consumption-based growth of the service industry. But systematic microeconomic \ntransformations in industries and infrastructure services are needed to enhance the environmental \noutcomes of this macroeconomic transformation. Meeting longer-term air quality standards can \nbe achieved only if major polluting sources adopt high technologies and cleaner production \npractices to meet stringent emission standards. In addition to stringent standards and a robust \nenforcement system, investments in air pollution reduction must be cost-effective to business \nowners. The role of advanced or high technologies in such a paradigm is important because it \ncan improve process efficiency while reducing emissions.  \n \n8.  Advanced or high technologies must be combined with appropriate financing to overcome \nexisting barriers (para. 6). In industry and infrastructure services, high technologies can be \ncombined for a more comprehensive low-emission solution for any specific application. An \nenergy-efficient building retrofit, for example, could include rooftop solar energy, more efficient \nlighting, advanced thermal management systems for space heating and cooling, and an intelligent \ndigital control system that ensures that all these high technologies work in sync as a system. But \nto be successful in this strategy requires bringing together a high level of technical expertise on \n                                                \n9  A targeted PM2.5 reduction of 40% from 2013 levels will still be about 50 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) or about \n50% higher than the national standard. The air quality standard for PM2.5 in the PRC (GB 3095-2012) is 35 \u00b5g/m3, \ncompared with 15 \u00b5g/m3 for the United States and Japan, and 10 \u00b5g/m3 for the World Health Organization. \n10 China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. 2015.

Demonstrating this \napproach through a selected portfolio of subprojects distributed across various industries and \ninfrastructure services in the greater BTH region can reinforce confidence in the commercial \nviability of such an approach and stimulate further demand. \n \n9.  The project will implement the strategy described in para. 8 by establishing a regional \nemission-reduction and pollution-control facility for the greater BTH region. The facility will support \ndeployment of high technologies in major emitting industries. It will be held at and controlled by \nthe China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP),11 which is highly \nregarded for its high level of technical expertise across key sectors. It also has a proven record \nof successfully managing similar investment funds. It will identify subprojects, match them with \nappropriate business models for deploying high technologies at scale, and provide financing \nthrough  the  facility.  The  facility  will  have  a  fund-of-funds  structure  with  three  types  of \ncomplementary investment funds: a regional fund,12 provincial or municipal funds involving local \ngovernment  investors,13  and  technology-  or  industry-specific  funds  targeting  high-polluting \nsources.14 In addition, the facility is expected to invest about 10% of the facility amount directly \ninto some highly potent pollution-reducing subprojects. The figure provides an overall structure of \nthe facility. \n \nOverall Structure of the Facility \n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BTH  =  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei,  CECEP  =  China  Energy  Conservation  and \nEnvironmental Protection Group, MOF = Ministry of Finance, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n11 CECEP is the PRC\u2019s largest state-owned enterprise focused on energy conservation and environmental protection, \nwith total assets of CNY144 billion. Its main business is in the areas of energy efficiency, clean energy, environmental \nprotection, and recycling of resources. \n12 The facility is expected to provide up to CNY1.75 billion, and the People\u2019s Insurance Company of China has proposed \nto contribute at least CNY1.75 billion (with an option for a maximum CNY4.25 billion). This fund is mainly used to \nsupport CECEP-led projects in the greater BTH region. \n13 The  Jinan  municipal  government  is  expected  to  contribute  CNY500  million,  the  facility  expects  to  provide \nCNY500 million, and the Industrial Bank Co., Ltd. is expected to contribute CNY1 billion. Discussion with other \nmunicipal governments is also ongoing, including with the Shenyang and Zhangjiakou municipalities. \n14 A Deep-Well Geothermal Development Fund is being set up to support deep-well geothermal for clean heating \ntechnology. The Dezhou municipal government proposes to contribute CNY100 million, the facility is expected to \nprovide CNY150 million, and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank is expected to contribute CNY750 million.  \n ", "4 \n10.  The facility will provide debt and equity investments to eligible subprojects, but will limit \nthe aggregate amount of equity investments. All equity investments will be protected with a \ncreditworthy put option15 against a third party or will have a viable exit strategy that will enable \nCECEP to recover the investment in a timely manner.16 Investee companies will have the \nfollowing necessary characteristics: (i) profitable, (ii) a professional management team, and (iii) \nclear routes of enhancing value. In the case of put-protected equity, the facility or the funds may \nsupport (i) special purpose vehicles for stand-alone equity investments to finance financially viable \nand capital-intensive subprojects where the sponsor lacks sufficient registered capital to raise \nnecessary debt funding, or (ii) enterprises with capital-intensive investments that need equity \nfinancing matching their risk profiles.17 \n \n11.  The facility will set up an energy service company (ESCO) fund to support energy-saving \nand emission-reduction subprojects in the iron and steel industry.18 ESCOs have been effective \nin driving energy-efficiency investments in other countries, and is a priority for the Government of \nthe PRC. But the region only has a limited number of ESCOs with the capacity to finance and \nimplement complex and larger industrial energy-efficiency projects. An Steel Group Energy \nSaving Technology Co., Ltd., which is expected to cofinance this fund with the facility and a \ncommercial bank, is an ESCO under the An Steel Group.19 It is one of only two registered ESCOs \nrecognized by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance in \nthe iron and steel industry. An Steel ESCO has identified for potential investments more than \n80 subprojects in the iron and steel industry.20 In addition, two CECEP \u201csuper ESCOs\u201d may \nreceive funding through the regional fund for further investment in qualified subprojects.21 \n \n12.  The project fully aligns with the priority of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 \nfor the PRC in support of the government\u2019s priority to realize ecological civilization.22 The project \nalso supports the priorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 to mitigate climate change \nand promote environmental sustainability.23 Some key features of the proposed project are briefly \ndescribed in paras. 13\u201318. \n \n13.  Innovative use of financial intermediation loan modality. The project will use the \nfinancial intermediation loan modality, which is best suited to (i) extend the project\u2019s reach across \n                                                \n15 A put option is an option contract in which the beneficiary of the put option obtains the right to sell a specified quantity \nof a security at a specified price within a fixed period or on the occurrence of certain events. \n16 Equity investments without a put will be provided in limited cases to support the expansion of proven, financially and \neconomically viable high technologies by companies that cannot meet commercial banks\u2019 collateral or the funds\u2019 \ndebt requirements. \n17 Most investments into the funds will be equity so that the funds themselves are not indebted. But the funds will be \nrequired to use facility\u2019s money primarily to invest as debt or as put-protected equity in subproject companies. The \nput provider must not have a poor credit record, as recorded in the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s credit history database. \nThe creditworthiness of the put providers needs to be monitored semiannually by CECEP, and in case their \ncreditworthiness drops, CECEP must inform ADB to take additional measures to mitigate the risks. \n18 The An Steel Group, one of the largest steel producers in PRC with a production capacity of 33.2 million tons, is \nexpected to contribute CNY100 million to the fund. The facility will contribute CNY300 million and the Shanghai \nPudong Development Bank is expected to contribute CNY1.2 billion. This is considered an industry-specific fund. \n19 An Steel Group Energy Saving Technology Services Co., Ltd. was formally established in 2010 with a registered \ncapital of CNY20 million, which gradually increased to CNY100 million. \n20 The iron and steel industry is a major polluting source. A high concentration of iron and steel plants exacerbates poor \nair quality in the region. \n21 A super ESCO is an entity normally established to facilitate large-scale implementation of energy-efficiency projects \nand support capacity building and project development activities of private ESCOs. \n22 ADB. 2016.

Reflows from the first \nbatch are expected to be relent to at least an additional batch of subprojects with an estimated \ninvestment of \u20ac1.3 billion. \n \n14.  Leverage large cofinancing. Each fund under the facility will leverage different sources \nof cofinancing. Specifically, the regional fund will leverage, for the first time, about \u20ac214 million in \ncofinancing from an institutional investor for ADB operations in the PRC. The local funds will \nleverage about \u20ac256.8 million from provincial or municipal governments and local financial \ninstitutions. The technology- or industry-specific funds will leverage about \u20ac171.2 million from \nindustry and financial institutions. Considering the large investment needs of about CNY1.8 \ntrillion, such leveraging is essential to maximize project impact. \n \n15.  Enable high technology deployment across key sectors. The facility\u2019s focus is on high \ntechnologies across key polluting sectors. CECEP developed robust project selection criteria to \nensure that high technology remains a priority in selected subprojects. This is best illustrated in \nthe first batch of subprojects that have been pre-appraised (paras. 31\u201336). \n \n16.  Achieve high co-benefits of climate change mitigation. Since fossil fuel burning is a \ncommon source of air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions in the BTH region, all \n2\nsubprojects supported by the facility will achieve significant CO  mitigation. It is estimated that by \n2\nthe closing of this loan, the facility will contribute 5 million tons of CO  mitigation each year. \n2\n \n17.  Improve sustainability via market-based approach. All facility investments are at \nmarket prices to help ensure the facility\u2019s sustainability. The participation of a wide array of \ncofinanciers will also help the cofinanciers gain better insights into the facility\u2019s operation and the \nmerits of investing in high technology for emission-reduction and pollution-control projects. This \nmay ensure their future interest in similar investments across the region and in the PRC. \n \n18.  Improve corporate governance. CECEP is one of the largest state-owned enterprises \nin the PRC. The setup of this facility has brought in an international dimension and introduced \nmany good practices into the project design, especially in the financial, environmental, and social \nmanagement of the facility. In addition, a higher level of due diligence, cofinancier partnerships, \nand  investment  decision-making  practices  will  further  enhance  CECEP\u2019s  capacity  and \ngovernance across this facility\u2019s operation. Many of these good practices are anticipated to spill \nover to other parts of CECEP\u2019s governance and management. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The project is aligned with the following impact: air pollution reduced and public health in \nthe BTH region improved (consistent with CAAP and Thirteenth plan). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: air pollution reduced and high technology deployed across the greater BTH \nregion.24 \n \n                                                \n24 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "6 \nC.  Outputs \n \n20.  Output 1: Regional Emission-Reduction and Pollution-Control Facility established. \nBy 2023, the project will establish a facility comprising regional, municipal, or provincial and \ntechnology- or industry-specific funds totaling \u20ac428.0 million. \n \n21.  Output  2:  High  technologies to  reduce  air  pollution in  agriculture,  distributed \nenergy, heating, transport, and iron and steel industry deployed. By 2023, the facility will \nprovide at least \u20ac1,721.2 million in financing for deploying high technologies to reduce emissions \nand pollution. This output will cover the (i) construction of three biogas and organic fertilizer \nproduction facilities, (ii) natural gas production from coke oven gas established at two coke oven \nfacilities, (iii) two smart micro-grids constructed in industrial parks, (iv) geothermal-based district \nheating provided to two million square meters of floor area, (v) completion of energy-efficiency \nmeasures in five iron and steel plants, and (vi) hydrogen fuel cell based public transport pilot \ntested. \n \n22.  Output 3: Capacity of key stakeholders to deploy high technologies for pollution \nreduction  in  the  greater  BTH  region  improved.  By  2023,  the  project  will  train  at  least \n200 individuals from five key stakeholders in high technologies, selection of appropriate business \nmodels, and investment decision-making. In addition, the project will prepare and disseminate a \nguideline on selecting, appraising, and implementing such projects in selected industries. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n23.  The investment cost of the first batch of subprojects is estimated to be \u20ac1,747.0 million \n(Table 1), including financial charges.25 \n \n24.  The government has requested a loan of \u20ac428.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 10 years;26 an annuity repayment at the 10% discount rate option; an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.95 years, \nand there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. ADB lending is expected to leverage \u20ac1,293.2 \nmillion  or  about  three  times  its  amount  through  commercial  financing,  local  government \ninvestments,  and  counterpart  contributions.  This  includes  estimated  ut  \u20ac642.0  million  from \ninstitutional  investors,  local  governments,  and  commercial  banks;  and  \u20ac651.2  million  from \nsubborrowers. \n \n25.  The Ministry of Finance will onlend the ADB loan proceeds to CECEP on identical \nrepayment terms, tenors, and pricing terms of ADB\u2019s loan in euros. CECEP will bear the interest \nand  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  ADB  loan.  Fund  flow,  implementation,  and  risk-sharing \narrangements are described in the project administration manual (PAM).27 The financing plan for \nthe anticipated first batch of subprojects is in Table 2. \n \n                                                \n25 An entrusted loan refers to the extension of credit by a bank as an agent of entrusted funds from the facility or fund. \nThe bank will administer the debt but assumes no credit risk. \n26 A longer grace period is essential to seek the rollover of ADB loan proceeds and larger impacts. \n27 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nTable 1: Indicative Investment Amounts for First Batch of Subprojects \n(\u20ac million) \nItem   Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  CECEP will be the executing agency. CECEP\u2019s majority-owned subsidiary, CECEP Huayu \nFund Management Co., Ltd., (CECEP Huayu) or another CECEP subsidiary, with equivalent \nexperience, approved by ADB after due diligence, will be the facility and fund manager (the \nManagement  Company).28  CECEP  Huayu  has  extensive  experience  in  the  design, \nimplementation, supervision, evaluation, financing, and management of energy-efficiency and \nenvironmental protection funds. CECEP Huayu has managed many of CECEP\u2019s clean energy \nfunds. The project\u2019s implementation structure is in the figure on page 3. \n \n27.  CECEP has an excellent grasp of the best available technologies and how best to finance \nand implement them.29 CECEP\u2019s expertise will be made available to the Management Company, \nthe facility, and the funds by way of an experts\u2019 committee that will advise the Management \nCompany and the funds on potential investments. As the fund manager, the Management \n                                                \n28 CECEP Huayu was established in 2011 to focus on investments in energy conservation and environmental \nprotection, and has managed more than CNY7 billion in funds. CECEP Huayu has thee shareholders, with CECEP \nCapital, a second-tier subsidiary of CECEP, holding a controlling ownership interest of 55%. Integrity due diligence \nof CECEP, CECEP Huayu, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank has been undertaken in consultation with \nADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity and Office of Cofinancing Operations. \n29 CECEP\u2019s subsidiaries are involved in industrial and building energy efficiency, solid waste treatment, solar and wind \nenergy, soil remediation and pollution control, and organic and inorganic waste recycling. CECEP also has an \nextensive network of internal and external experts in these sectors; and extensive experience in planning, \nimplementing, and monitoring investments in them. \n ", "8 \nCompany will assess and approve investments in the funds and individual subprojects through \nan investment committee. The investment review and approval process will include investment \nstructuring to mitigate technical and financial risks and appraisal of environmental and social \nimpact  and  risk  under  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS).30  The \nManagement  Company\u2019s  due  diligence  will  consider  technical  merit,  credit  quality,  and \nenvironmental and social impacts based on the subproject selection criteria.31 \n \n28.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 27). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  May 2018\u2013May 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 November 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  NDRC and MOF \n(ii)  Executing agency  CECEP \n(iii)  Financial intermediary  CECEP will bear the credit risk of the facility. CECEP will establish investment \nand implementing agency  committees for the facility and each fund. ADB will require CECEP to obtain a no \nobjection from ADB for entrusted loans where the amount of ADB loan proceeds to \nbe invested is above the free limit of \u20ac80 million. CECEP and the facility will contract \nwith the entrusted bank to administer accounts and provide cofinancing. \n(iv)  Implementation unit  The PMO established in CECEP Huayu will act as the main implementation unit and \nwill have about 20 full-time staff. CECEP will enter into a strategic cooperation \nframework agreement with China Environmental Resources Technology Co., Ltd. to \nprovide expertise on environmental assessment and monitoring. CECEP will also \nestablish an experts\u2019 committee to support technical appraisal and monitoring. \nProcurement  The investee companies will use commercial practices acceptable to ADB for \nprocuring goods and services using the proceeds of the subloans and equity \ninvestments. ADB has prepared a procurement manual to provide guidance on how \ncommercial practices can be adopted in a manner consistent with ADB\u2019s procurement \nprinciples. \nRetroactive financing and/or  The executing agency may sign subloan agreements prior to the loan agreement \nadvance contracting  signing with ADB, and this will be deemed as advance contracting. Retroactive \nfinancing may be provided to refinance loans made for a subproject or to finance any \nsubproject that was self-financed by its owners and started before the effective date, \nprovided that expenditures being financed or refinanced were incurred not earlier \nthan 12 months prior to the signing of the loan agreement, and that the subproject \nwas vetted under CECEP\u2019s environmental and social management system and is \nfully compliant. Total retroactive financing will not exceed 20% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and ADB and described in the project administration manual as \nspecial disbursement guidelines.a \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CECEP = China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group; CECEP \nHuayu = CECEP Huayu Fund Management Co., Ltd.; MOF = Ministry of Finance; NDRC = National Development and \nReform Commission; PMO = project management office. \na  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n30 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). CECEP and CECEP Huayu will adopt and implement the ESMS for the facility and \nfor each fund following national policies and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). CECEP will \nconduct environmental and social due diligence to confirm compliance with the ESMS and national environment, \nhealth, and safety law and regulations before a subproject is approved. \n31 The eligibility criteria for the financed subprojects are in Appendix 3 of the Project Administration Manual and the \nFinancial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (footnote 27 and 30). \n ", "9 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  The PAM details the subproject selection criteria, covering applicable technical, financial, \neconomic, and environmental and social safeguard requirements. It also includes guidelines on \nthe screening and appraisal of individual transactions (footnote 31). ADB requires CECEP to \nprepare appraisal reports to verify compliance with the selection criteria and obtain ADB\u2019s no \nobjection for subprojects using debt financing that (i) are financed with retroactive financing, \n(ii) receive ADB financing exceeding the free limit of \u20ac80 million for entrusted loans, or (iii) require \nany equity investment to be undertaken. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n30.  ADB carried out a detailed appraisal of six representative potential subprojects with good \npotential  for  replication.32  The  cost  of  the  representative  subprojects  is  estimated  at \n\u20ac225.6 million. Another set of potential subprojects with total investment of \u20ac4 billion is currently \nbeing screened and appraised. Technical due diligence of representative subprojects verified (i) \nthe technical feasibility and appropriateness of the proposed technologies to maximize energy \nsavings and pollution reductions and (ii) the estimated cost. The high technologies used in the \nrepresentative subprojects are briefly described in paras. 31\u201336. \n \n31.  Deep-well geothermal district heating. The facility will support deployment of deep-well \ngeothermal technology to overcome barriers such as higher capital cost and weak capacity and \nunderstanding on drilling, geological condition, and perceived technical and financial risks. The \nfacility will support mature drilling technology for geothermal wells and use tailwater recharging \ntechnology for sustainable heat extraction without any water depletion.33 This subproject can \nprovide continuous heating, and even cooling, using 100% renewable energy with no direct \nemissions. By demonstrating the technology and its financial viability at existing heating tariffs, \nthe subproject will help its wider deployment.  \n \n32.  Industrial by-product gas use. The subproject will use coke oven gas to produce \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) for use in transportation, instead of the current practice of using coke \noven gas to generate onsite electricity and steam or to produce urea or methanol, which produce \nhigh air pollution.34 In addition, LNG is a cost-competitive and less polluting fuel for heavy-duty \nand long-distance transportation compared to diesel. This subproject will improve the availability \nof LNG supply and encourage more truck owners to retrofit their trucks to use LNG as fuel.  \n \n33.  Hydrogen-based low-emission transport. The subproject will use surplus wind energy \nto produce hydrogen in sustainable transport applications via investments in hydrogen fuel cell \nbuses. This is an innovative renewable energy storage solution that will help reduce curtailment \nof renewable energy, mainly from wind farms. Using hydrogen as transport fuel to displace diesel \nis one of the best applications in terms of reducing the public health hazards posed by PM  \n2.5\nemissions from diesel combustion in the greater BTH region.  \n \n \n                                                \n32 The technical description of the representative sample subprojects is in the Introduction of Technologies Used for \nRepresentative Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Tailwater recharging technology recharges water back to the underground reservoir after purification to avoid \nreservoir water depletion and environmental pollution. \n34 The coke oven by-gas utilization is a high policy priority in the greater BTH region. The ADB loan in footnote 2 \nincluded this policy action for Hebei. \n ", "10 \n34.  Advanced biogas and organic fertilizer. The subproject uses anaerobic fermentation \ntechnology for biogas production. The produced biogas is then purified and compressed. The \ncompressed biogas is sold to consumers to replace gasoline and diesel for transport in the filling \nstation. In the PRC, organic waste production from straw, livestock manure, and agricultural waste \nexceeds 3.5 billion tons per year. However, the lack of an appropriate business model has delayed \nthe scale-up of this technology. The special feature of this subproject is a well-designed business \nmodel that can solve the problems faced during the biogas industry development, such as low \neconomic performance and unsustainable feedstock supply. The organic fertilizer produced by \nthis subproject could improve soil and air quality in the long run. \n \n35.  Smart  industrial  zone  development.  The  subproject  creates  a  micro-energy  grid \nnetwork consisting of a few sub-micro-energy grids, including incorporating a broad spectrum of \nclean  energy  (natural  gas  trigeneration,  rooftop  solar,  and  concentrated  solar  thermal \ntechnologies); energy storage technology; energy efficiency; and intelligent energy management \nsystems to improve energy use in a high-technology industrial zone. It also optimizes energy use \nby allowing for energy trading between the sub-grids and with the regional grid for bidirectional \npower trade.  \n \n36.  Super energy service company. The subproject comprises a package of investments in \nindustrial waste heat recovery, energy-efficiency improvement, and emission-reductions. The \nbusiness model presented is important in that the energy recovery-and-use process effectively \npays for the emission-reduction requirements processes, which would otherwise be unprofitable, \ni.e., the subproject will prove that pollution control can be financially self-sustaining. The PRC\u2019s \niron and steel industry has great energy-saving and emission-reduction potential. The subproject \nis replicable throughout the iron and steel industry in the PRC.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n37.  Financial  due  diligence  confirmed  CECEP\u2019s financial  viability.  CECEP  has  a strong \nfinancial  standing  and  can  meet  financial  obligations  and  debt  service  payments  without \ndifficulty.35 The integrity due diligence on CECEP and CECEP Huayu showed no negative \nfindings. Subprojects, subborrowers, and equity investees will need to meet economic and \nfinancial viability criteria, as documented in the PAM. The financial assessment of the facility and \nthe funds demonstrated their sustainability under prudent loss assumptions.36  \n \n38.  ADB calculated the financial internal rate of return for the appraised representative \nsubprojects, which is 7.9%\u201338.0% and is higher than the weighted average cost of capital. The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  appraised  subprojects  is  7.5%\u201344.0%.37  The  non-\nincremental benefits of the representative subprojects include the avoided use of coal, diesel, \npetroleum, and nitrogenous fertilizer, as well as external benefits of CO  emissions and local \n2\npollutant abatement.  Global environmental benefits from CO  abatement are valued at the 2016 \n2\nglobal social cost of carbon of $36.30 per ton of CO , adjusted to 2017 price levels, and increased \n2\nannually by 2%.. Local environmental benefits from pollutant emissions abatement are valued by \nestimating the cost of premature mortality (labor loss) associated with the pollutants.  \n \n                                                \n35 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Based on ADB\u2019s Guideline for the Economic analysis of Projects, projects that primarily generate environmental \nbenefits (such as pollution control, protection of ecosystem, flood control and control of deforestation), the minimum \nrequired EIRR can be lowered to 6%.  \n ", "11 \nC.  Governance \n \n39.  Financial  management  assessment.  ADB  conducted  the  financial  management \nassessment  following  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.38  The  result \nshowed that CECEP has adequate financial management systems and procedures in place to \nmeet ADB requirements. CECEP\u2019s 2012\u20132015 external audit reports had an unqualified opinion. \nThe financial management risk before mitigation is moderate (footnote 35). \n \n40.  Procurement risk assessment. Procurement will follow ADB Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time) applicable to financial intermediation loans, and appropriate \nprocedures will be adopted. ADB conducted procurement assessment on representative potential \nsubprojects. It showed that candidate investees\u2019 procurement practices followed established \ndomestic commercial practices, and procurement procedures aligned with PRC procurement laws \nacceptable to ADB. Use of procurement agencies will be encouraged, where  procurement \ncapacity is weak. To provide guidance, ADB has prepared and included a project-specific \nprocurement manual in Appendix 5 of the PAM. \n \n41.  Corruption prevention. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and CECEP. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n42.  The project will reduce air pollution and mitigate the negative social and economic impacts \nof local pollution. Improved air quality will directly benefit 371 million people, of whom 155.4 million \nare women, including 15 million poor people in the BTH region, of whom 5.4 million are poor \nwomen. In addition, the project will indirectly create new employment. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n43.  The  project  is  classified  financial  intermediary  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.39 ADB conducted environmental and social due diligence \non CECEP\u2019s existing portfolio and safeguard policies, institutional capacity, and six sample \nsubprojects.  ADB  and  CECEP  jointly  developed  an  ESMS  to  meet  national  laws  and  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The ESMS provides guidance on (i) \nscreening, categorization, and review of subprojects; (ii) organizational structure and staffing, \nincluding skills and competencies in environmental and social areas; (iii) capacity building; (iv) \ngrievance redress; and (v) monitoring and reporting. Subprojects classified category A for the \nenvironment and category A and category B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nare excluded from ADB financing. The ESMS will be approved by ADB and fully implemented \nprior to first disbursement.  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n44.  Significant risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.40 The integrated project benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n38 ADB. 2005.

Based on the review of initial subproject proposals, demand for \nfinancing is strong and is expected to increase as the government \nmaintains regulatory pressure for air quality improvements. \nA possible conflict of interest may arise in  The following measures were included in the project design: (i) limiting \nsituations where the facility and the funds  financing of such subprojects to the regional fund with participation by \nwill finance subprojects of companies  non-CECEP-affiliated investors or otherwise with ADB approval, and \naffiliated with CECEP.  (ii) including mechanisms for review and approval or waiver of conflicts \nof interest, that are acceptable to ADB and approved by all fund \ninvestors. \nA potential fund mismatch may occur when  Equity investment by the facility or the funds will only be allowed if (i) it \nusing loan proceeds to invest equity.  is protected with a put option by a creditworthy third party or (ii) there is \nanother viable exit strategy. Every equity investment requires ADB\u2019s \nprior approval. ADB has set an aggregate limit for equity investments. \nCECEP will monitor the creditworthiness of the put provider for put-\nprotected equity, and actions will be taken if the creditworthiness drops. \nInsufficient fund management staffing.  The Management Company will get its new recruitment plan approved \nby CECEP and execute it in a timely manner.  \nPoor investment performance.  The  Management  Company  needs  to  get  the  market-based \ncompensation incentive policy for its staff approved by CECEP and \nimplement it. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BTH = Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei, CECEP = China Energy Conservation and Environment \nProtection Group. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n45.  The government and CECEP have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n46.  The government and CECEP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n47.
