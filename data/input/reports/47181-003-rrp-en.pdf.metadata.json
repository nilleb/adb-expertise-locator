The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant \nto  be  provided  by  the  Green  Climate  Fund  (GCF)  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Water \nResources Management in the Pyanj River Basin Project, and if the Board approves the proposed \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of \nthe grant. \n \n2. \nThe proposed additional financing will expand the scope of the current project to include \ncapacity  building  and  institutional  development  of  the  State  Agency  for  Hydrometeorology  of \nTajikistan  (Hydromet)  to  provide  quality  climate  services  for  water  resources  management \n(WRM),  agricultural  production,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  in  the  Pyanj  River  Basin  (PRB)  in \nsouthern Tajikistan.1 The project will address Hydromet\u2019s key underlying institutional weaknesses \nand support its development to a sustainable and well-resourced national agency for meteorology \nand hydrology. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale  \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nTajikistan is one of the most vulnerable countries in Central Asia to the adverse impacts \nof climate change, with the water resources and agriculture sectors most affected.2 Over 70% of \nthe population lives in rural areas, mostly relying on agriculture production for their livelihoods.3 \nAmong these, the poor are generally most exposed to prevailing climatic conditions and natural \nhazards. In the period 1990\u20132016, the country experienced approximately 45 significant climate-\nrelated natural disasters, of which 60% were floods. These disasters caused about 500 deaths \nand $1.5 billion in damages.4 Future climatic changes are expected to exacerbate such events \nand generate additional negative impacts. Annual and winter mean temperatures in Tajikistan are \nexpected  to  increase  by  up  to  2  degrees  Celsius  by  2050  from  the  1971\u20132000  baseline. 5 \nIncreased  temperatures  and  evapotranspiration  may  increase  irrigation  water  demand  and \ndecrease agricultural yields (footnote 3). Accelerated glacier retreat may increase monthly river \nflow rates in the medium term, followed by declines in the longer term. Flood events may increase \nin magnitude and frequency.6 \n \nThe Government of Tajikistan has recognized climate change as a key risk to its future \n4. \ndevelopment  and  has  prioritized  improving  resilience  and  adapting  to  its  adverse  impacts. \nTajikistan\u2019s  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  to  the  Paris  Agreement  of  the  United  Nations \nFramework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  prioritizes  reducing  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

It is economically vital to the country as it includes \nthe  majority  of  Khatlon  province,  which  is  the  country\u2019s  most  populated  and  agriculturally \nproductive province. However, districts in the PRB are among the poorest in the country and most \nexposed and vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.10 The Khatlon Province Flood \nRisk Management Project, completed in 2014, and the ongoing Building Climate Resilience in the \nPyanj River Basin Project have supported disaster and climate resilience in water resources and \nagriculture  through  investments  in  infrastructure  for  the  most  vulnerable  districts  and  capacity \nbuilding on community disaster preparedness.11 \n \nThe current project continues ADB\u2019s support in the PRB by improving the government\u2019s \n6. \nWRM  capacity  and  increasing  agricultural  productivity  and  water  use  efficiency  in  irrigated \nagriculture (footnote 1). The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MEWR) and the Agency \nfor  Land  Reclamation  and  Irrigation  (ALRI)  are  the  project  executing  agencies. 12 Under  the \nMEWR-led component,  the  project  will  establish river  basin organizations and strengthen their \ncapacity for river basin management, including improved monitoring of water use for irrigation. \nThe project will also support Tajikistan\u2019s contribution to joint management of the PRB through a \njoint Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan Pyanj River Basin commission.13 Under the ALRI-led component, the \nChubek  Irrigation  System  will  be  modernized  and  climate-proofed,  including  the  irrigation  and \ndrainage infrastructure and pumping stations. The project will also support capacity building of \nfarmers and water user associations on water use efficiency and agricultural productivity. \n \nTimely and accurate reporting, forecasting, and warning of weather, hydrometeorological, \n7. \nand climatic conditions are critical inputs to effective WRM, agricultural production, and disaster \nrisk reduction. ALRI and MEWR\u2019s operations rely on the provision of these inputs by the national \nforecasting  entity,  Hydromet.  The  importance  of  such  services  will  grow  under  future  climatic \nchanges. Market research has revealed interest and willingness to pay among key stakeholders \nfor a broad array of new specialized information services from Hydromet. However, Hydromet is \nhindered  by  many  of  the  weaknesses  of  post-Soviet  institutions,  including  limited  budget, \ndecaying  infrastructure,  and  poor  staff  retention.  Consequently,  it  has  insufficient  capacity  to \nprovide quality services. Its monitoring network is sparse, it has limited forecasting and warning \ncapabilities, and limited resources to improve or develop new outputs to meet users\u2019 needs.  \n\n                                                \n7 Government of Tajikistan. 2015.

Manila. (G0506-AFG) \n\n\f \n8. \nStrengthening  the  institutional  and  technical  capacity  of  Hydromet  is  critical  to  the \ncountry\u2019s  climate  resilience  and  adaptation  efforts.  Several  externally  supported  projects  have \nsought  to  improve  Hydromet\u2019s  capacity  in  data  collection,  analysis,  and  forecasting  through \ninvestments  in  training  and  equipment.  The  ongoing  World  Bank  Central  Asia  Hydromet \nModernization  Project  has  invested  in  the  monitoring  network  and  short-term  weather \nforecasting.14 ADB technical assistance for Building Capacity for Climate Resilience is investing \nin  long-term  climate  change  modeling. 15  However,  Hydromet  still  has  limited  capacity  for \nhydrometeorological  monitoring,  hydrological  modelling,  and  flood  forecasting.  In  addition,  no \nexternally  financed  projects  to  date  have  focused  on  Hydromet\u2019s  key  underlying  institutional \nweaknesses, which are the source of its problems. Unless these weaknesses are addressed, the \nsustainability and effectiveness of any capacity-building interventions are likely to be low. \n \n9. \nThe additional financing is needed to expand the scope of the current project to include \ncapacity building and institutional development of Hydromet. The report and recommendation of \nthe  President  of \nfor \nhydrometeorological  monitoring  and  forecasting  (footnote  1).  By  improving  the  quality  of \nHydromet\u2019s  services  to  ALRI,  MEWR,  and  other  key  stakeholders  in  the  PRB,  the  additional \nfinancing will directly support and enhance the outputs of the current project. Improved information \ndelivery,  forecasting,  and  warning  by  Hydromet  will  (i)  support  efficient  WRM  and  agricultural \nproductivity  among  river  basin  organizations,  water  user  organizations,  and  farmers;  and \n(ii) reduce  disaster  impacts  to  settlements,  water  resources  infrastructure,  and  irrigation \ninfrastructure.16 Engagement between Hydromet and its key users will be strengthened, thereby \nimproving the relevance and utility of its services.  \n \n10. \nFollowing  approval  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  on  28  September  2016,  the  current \nproject  was  made  effective  on  8  August  2017  and  is  performing  well  based  on  the  following \nassessment:17 \n\nthe  prospect  of  additional \n\nthe  current  project  raised \n\nfinancing \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. The current project is on track to meet its intended \noutputs:  (a)  water  resources  in  the  PRB  better  managed;  (b)  modernized  and \nclimate-proofed  Chubek  Irrigation  System  WRM  infrastructure  fully  operational; \nand (c) farm management capacity and water use skill improved. \nImplementation  progress.  Following  delayed  project  effectiveness  caused  by \nslower than expected internal government approvals, the project is now back on \nschedule. As of April 2018, cumulative contract awards were $3.2 million (12% of \ntotal) and disbursement was $1.1 million (4% of total) against 15% elapsed time. \nThree project implementation consultant (PIC) teams, one for each output, have \nbeen  recruited  and  mobilized  as  of  November  2017.  Bidding  for  the  major  civil \nworks  and  supply  contracts  will  commence  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018,  with \ncontract award targeted in the fourth quarter of 2018. The project closing date is \n30 June 2022.  \nSafeguard compliance. The current project is category B for environment and C \nfor involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. No significant adverse social \nor  environmental  impacts  are  expected  as  physical  activities  are  primarily \nconducted  on  existing  irrigation  systems.  The  project  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n14 World Bank. 2011. Central Asia Hydromet Modernization Project. Project appraisal document.

The  current  project  remains \ntechnically feasible and is expected to be economically viable and financially sound. Investments \nin  the  climate  resilience  of  WRM  are  a  high  government  priority,  in  line  with  climate  change \nadaptation  and  national  development  strategies.  The  current  project  and  proposed  additional \nfinancing are consistent with the current country partnership strategy.19 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  impacts  of  the  overall  project  will  be  (i)  irrigated  land  in  good  condition  and  food \nsecurity  increased  (unchanged), 20  (ii)  the  efficiency  of  water  resource  use  increased \n(unchanged), 21  and  (iii)  climate  resilience  of  agriculture  and  WRM  improved  (added). 22  The \noutcome  of  the  overall  project  will  be  agricultural  productivity  and  relevance  of  forecasting \nservices increased in the PRB (changed).23 \n  \nC. \n \n13. \nfollows.

The  project  will  build \nHydromet\u2019s capacity for flood forecasting and warning in the PRB area. It will install monitoring \ndevices  (e.g.,  river  gauges  and  weather  stations)  and  warning  systems,  and  develop  a  flood \nforecasting model for selected pilot areas. Target communities will be consulted and trained  in \nthe flood warnings and disaster preparedness. Hydromet staff will be trained in the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the flood forecasting and warning systems. \n \n15.  Modernize Hydromet\u2019s operations center. The project will relocate Hydromet\u2019s central \noperations in Dushanbe from its current dilapidated campus to a new compound in the capital \npreviously allocated to Hydromet. The project will complete the half-finished office building in the \ncompound and install a core information technology system for processing, networking, and data \nstorage.  The  project  will  also  construct  adjacent  ancillary  buildings  including  a  warehouse, \n\n                                                \n18 The project was erroneously rated potential problem in eOps in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of a system error. \n19 ADB. 2016.

The legal status of Hydromet \nwill  be  updated  to  that  of  a  state  entity  with  increased  management  and  financial  autonomy. \nHydromet will remain a public service entity, primarily funded by the government budget, providing \nforecasts  and  public  information  (including  critical  alerts)  free  of  charge.  However,  the  legal \nchange will allow Hydromet to seek, retain, and use additional commercial revenue to supplement \nits government budgetary support. Additional revenue sources are expected to include (i) the sale \nof specialty fee-based information products such as data, and customized forecasts and alerts; \n(ii) rental  of  facilities  such  as  office  and  conference  space  on  commercial  terms;  and \n(iii) consulting and other technical advisory services. The project will provide capacity building to \nHydromet staff on strategy, management, administration, and control in line with its updated legal \nframework.  The  project  will  develop  a  strategic  O&M  plan,  including  annually  updated  budget \nforecasts.  The  project  will  support  knowledge  sharing  events  between  Hydromet  with  other \nnational hydrometeorological (or related) agencies in the region. \n \n\nb.  \n\nOutput  3:  Farm  Management  Capacity  and  Water  Use  Skill  Improved \n(unchanged) \n\n17. \nFee-based  information  services.

Such products may include historical datasets, focused daily or weekly forecasts, \nand  location-  or  sector-specific  weather  alerts,  on  a  one-time  or  subscription  basis.  Such \ninformation  services  could  offer  significant  value  to  clients\u2019  planning  and  O&M  decisions,  e.g., \nirrigation,  planting,  and  harvesting  scheduling  by  farmers.  Pricing  will  be  tailored  to  the  target \nmarket, taking into account affordability. An information technology platform will be developed to \nallow the provision of such services through widely available communication media such as email, \nweb, short messaging service, and apps.

A PIC led by an international team leader will be recruited to \nsupport  project  implementation.  To  expedite  project  readiness,  Hydromet  will  aim  to  issue  the \nrequests  for  proposals  to  the  consulting  firms  before  Board  approval.  The  implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.26 For  the  additional  financing  project,  universal  procurement  will  apply,  as  ADB  and \nGCF\u2019s resources will jointly finance individual procurement packages. \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements for Additional Financing \n \nArrangements \nNovember 2018\u2013June 2023 \n30 June 2023 \n31 December 2023 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated grant closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nProject steering committee \nDeputy prime minister (chair) \nDirector of the ALRI; chairs of the Committee on Environmental \nProtection, Committee for State Investment and State Property \nManagement, and Committee for Women and Family Affairs; deputy \nministers of the ministries of agriculture, economic development and \ntrade, energy and water resources, foreign affairs, and finance \n(members) \nHydromet \nDushanbe, expected 13 Hydromet PIG staff \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive \nbidding \nShopping \n\nMultiple contracts \n\n5 contracts \n\n3 contracts \n\n$4.8 million \n(estimate) \n$2.0 million \n(estimate) \n$0.25 million \n(estimate) \n$1.9 milliona \n(estimate) \n\nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection \n(90:10) \n\n44 person-months \ninternational \n158 person-months \nnational (estimate) \n\nAdvanced contracting will be used to recruit the project \nimplementation consultant. \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ALRI = Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation, Hydromet = State Agency for \nHydrometeorology of Tajikistan, PIG = project implementation group. \nNote: Cost estimates exclude government contributions in the form of exemptions to taxes and duties. \na Includes travel, workshops, studies, surveys and design, office administration and equipment, and contingencies. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n                                                \n25 The executing agencies for the current project are MEWR (output 1) and ALRI (output 2 and 3). \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  was  designed  with  a  view  to  establish  a  sustainable  and  viable  national \n21. \ninstitution,  based  on  detailed  studies on  Hydromet\u2019s  organizational  and technical  capacity  and \nlegal  structure.  The  planned  legal  and  organizational  transformations,  along  with  the \nmodernization  of  the  operations  center,  will  help  overcome  key  institutional  weaknesses  and \nbarriers. This will provide a solid foundation upon which Hydromet may develop technical capacity \nfor monitoring, forecasting, and informing the public. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe  economic  assessment  confirmed  the  economic  viability  of  the  additional  financing \nproject.  The  calculated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  11%  and  the  economic  net  present \nvalue  is  $6.5  million  at  the  discount  rate  of  6%  for  disaster  risk  reduction  investments.27 The \nproject- quantified benefits are incremental avoided future impacts of flooding in the PRB area, \narising  from  a  strengthened  Hydromet  providing  improved  services.  The  economic  results  are \nrobust  to  alternative  cost  and  benefit  scenarios.  Nonquantifiable  benefits  include  increased \nagricultural productivity and avoidance of damage, displacement, and deaths from climate-related \ndisasters. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  also  expected  to  provide  significant  financial  benefits  to  Hydromet  and \ncontribute to its long-term viability. As with other national meteorological agencies, it is envisaged \nthat Hydromet will remain funded primarily through the government budget during and after the \nproject because of its public service mandate. The project will help Hydromet secure additional \ncommercial  revenues  to  support  increased  investment  and  O&M  expenditures  for  improved \nsustainability.  These  revenues  are  expected  to  contribute  about  10%  of  Hydromet\u2019s  annual \nbudget by project completion and 15% by 2030. In addition, effective annual salary packages for \nkey Hydromet staff are expected to more than double by 2025 against the without-project case, \nas a result of improved funding from commercial revenues and housing benefits, and thereby help \nHydromet attract and retain highly skilled staff. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Hydromet.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 26). \n \n25. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  Hydromet  concluded  that  it  represents  a \nsubstantial risk because of less effective internal controls, accounting and financial reporting, and \nfunds  flow.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design,  including \n(i) recruiting  experienced  and  qualified  staff  for  the  PIG;  (ii)  providing  financial  management \nsupport and training under the PIC; and (iii) providing training in ADB procedures related to audit, \ndisbursement, and project management. \n \n26. \nThe procurement capacity assessment concluded that Hydromet represents a substantial \nrisk because of (i) lack of qualified procurement staff; (ii) lack of experience and unfamiliarity with \ncompetitive  procurement  processes  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2017.

Mitigation measures have been incorporated into \nthe project design, including (i) recruiting experienced and qualified staff for the PIG; (ii) providing \nprocurement  support  and  training  under  the  PIC;  (iii)  providing  training  in  ADB  procurement \nprocedures, including ADB standard bidding documents; and (iv) use of prior review procedures. \n \nD. \n \nPoverty.  The  poorest  households  in  the  PRB  are generally  the  most  vulnerable  to  the \n27. \nimpacts of climate change. The project will improve the provision of climate services and warnings \nto stakeholder agencies, community groups, and individuals, including on damaging flood events \nin  the  PRB.  Improved  provision  of  information  products  marketed  at  farmers  and  local \ncommunities  will  support  decision  making  in  agriculture,  WRM,  and  other  climate-sensitive \nactivities, thereby improving the livelihoods and income of the poor. \n \n28. \nSocial  and  gender.  The  additional  financing  project  is  categorized  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  The  project  will  ensure  consultations,  training,  and  awareness  campaigns  for \nflood forecasting and fee-based information services are gender-sensitive, with significant female \nrepresentation.  The  project  will  narrow  gender  gaps  in  Hydromet  by  increasing  female \nrepresentation in key positions and providing training in management, administration, and control. \n \nE. \n \n29. \n \n30. \nEnvironment (category B). The project\u2019s residual adverse impacts are not expected to \nbe  significant,  after  the  implementation  of  feasible  environmental  management  measures. \nExpected  construction-phase \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website,  following  receipt  of  Hydromet\u2019s \nconcurrence, in January 2018.28 The Hydromet PIG will submit semiannual safeguard monitoring \nreports to ADB and establish and implement the grievance redress mechanism described in the \ninitial environmental examination. \n  \n31. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). No involuntary acquisition of land or involuntary \nrestrictions on land use are expected, according to the SPS definition. The Hydromet PIG and \nPIC  will  confirm  this  during  implementation.  If  any  additional  land  requirements  or  involuntary \nresettlement impacts are identified, a resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSPS and approved by ADB before any related civil works contract is awarded. \n \n32. \narea, according to the SPS definition. \n \nF. \n \n33.
