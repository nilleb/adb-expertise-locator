The project builds on a relationship that began when COVID-19 \n4. \nwas first identified. Before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, in early December 2019, ADB \nmet with the senior management of Jointown and visited the company\u2019s largest logistics center in \nWuhan city, Hubei Province, as part of due diligence to support Jointown\u2019s planned expansion \nin 2020. \n \n5. \nSoon after the visit, the COVID-19 pandemic began to intensify in the PRC, particularly in \nWuhan city where the client is headquartered. Quickly adapting to the needs of its DMCs and to \nclients  such  as  Jointown,  ADB  in  February  2020  approved  a  2-year  CNY130.0  million  loan  to \nJointown for the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project, to fund Jointown\u2019s short-term working \ncapital needs to support the company\u2019s operations during the pandemic in the PRC.3 Jointown \nwas  one  of  the  pharmaceutical  distributors  designated  by  the  government  to  procure  and \ndistribute  medical  supplies  to  ensure  continued  availability  of  pharmaceuticals  during  the \npandemic.4 ADB\u2019s emergency response loan to Jointown has been fully disbursed. \n \n6. \nProject  design.  ADB  will  provide  a  5-year  loan  to  Jointown  to  support  its  capital \nexpenditure needs to construct pharmaceutical distribution facilities in Haikou (Hainan Province), \nTangshan  (Hebei  Province),  and  Nanjing  (Jiangsu  Province)  through  Jointown\u2019s  regional \nsubsidiaries. These pharmaceutical distribution facilities will also include cold chain warehouses \n\nmedicines and medical equipment.  \n\n \n\n1   Pharmaceutical  distribution  facilities  consist  of  warehouses  and  logistics  fleets  (delivery  trucks)  for  distribution  of \n\n2   Although one of the three facilities funded by ADB is located in Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu Province, the facilities \n\nserve broader areas in the province including Tier 2 and 3 cities and other rural areas.   \n\n3  ADB. 2020.

[CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n7. \nThe loan is part of ADB\u2019s broader COVID-19 response. While the COVID-19 pandemic \nhas abated in the PRC, the country remains susceptible to a sudden surge in cases as there is \nno  proven  treatment  or  vaccine  for  COVID-19  (as  of  September  2020).  As  the  possibility  of \nanother  wave  of  infections  remains,  the  World  Health  Organization  has  recommended  that \nnational  authorities  ensure  operational  support  and  logistics,  including  by  preparing  surge \ncapacity and assessing the capacity of the local market to meet increased demand for medical \nand other essential supplies.5 ADB\u2019s support will ensure that Jointown can expand its distribution \ncapacity  to  help  meet  the  PRC\u2019s  pharmaceutical  surge  capacity  requirements  if  the  pandemic \npicks up once again in the PRC. The pharmaceutical distribution facilities will also have capacity \nto store COVID-19 vaccines.  \n\n1.   \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n8. \n \n \n9. \nGender  equality  has  reportedly  been  on  the  decline  in  the  labor  market  in  terms  of \nemployment and pay gaps, as well as physical and sexual harassment. Gender diversity within \nthe workforce is important in the pharmaceuticals industry to ensure outreach to diversified clients. \nGlobally,  women  outnumber  men  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  workforce,  yet  in  the  PRC, \nwomen  continue  to  be  underrepresented  in  senior  and  leadership  positions.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] Measures for gender equality will look at sustaining these numbers \ngiven the current constraints due to COVID-19 impacts. The project will address this through a \ngender action plan (GAP), further aiming to improve gender inclusion by formalizing aspects of \nanti-harassment and awareness of gender equality issues across Jointown sites.6 \n \n10. \nBorrower. Established in 1999 by Liu Baolin in Wuhan city, Jointown is the PRC's fourth \nlargest  pharmaceutical  distributor  and  the  only  privately  owned  distributor  among  the  top  five. \nJointown has been listed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange since 2010 and, as \nof 25 September 2020, had a market capitalization of CNY31.8 billion ($4.7 billion). \n \nJointown procures pharmaceutical products and small medical devices, storing them in its \n11. \nlarge network of pharmaceutical distribution facilities to be sold subsequently to hospitals, clinics, \nand retail pharmacies throughout the PRC.

The project is aligned with two \noperational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities,  and  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality.9 The  objectives  are  also  aligned \nwith  the  government\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2016\u20132020),  particularly  the  aim  to  expand \nservices (education, health and elderly care), and to encourage greater private sector participation \nin the economy.10 \n \n19. \nThe loan will support the development of smarter health care service delivery systems to \nexpand access to quality and affordable health care. The project will also create jobs directly at \nthe three pharmaceutical distribution facilities targeted for expansion. The GAP will incorporate \nmeasures  to  empower  women  by  generating  inclusive  employment  within  the  pharmaceutical \nindustry,  increasing  awareness  of  gender-based  harassment,  and  increasing  outreach  to  both \nmen and women on accessing pharmaceutical products. \n \n20. \nThe project is also aligned with private sector operations for inclusive economic growth \nwhich  is  one  of  the  strategic  priority  areas  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership strategy for the  PRC, \n2016\u20132020.

The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, which sets forth a plan for ADB to take a \nholistic approach to investing in health infrastructure. Through this plan, ADB envisioned investing \nin  strengthening  the  supply  of  quality  pharmaceuticals,  medical  goods,  and  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  systems  throughout  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  project  further \naligns with ADB support for private sector approaches to address quality, efficiency, and financing \nissues in health infrastructure, as outlined in the Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020.12 \n \n\n \n\n8  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2016.

Jointown\u2019s competitive advantage \nis its sophisticated ICT system, which allows it to collect data points to inform decision-making. \nIts efficient warehouse and inventory management systems were recognized when, at the peak \nof the COVID-19 pandemic in the PRC in early 2020, it was asked by the local government to \nmanage the warehouses of the Wuhan and Hubei branches of the Red Cross Society of China to \nclassify, store, and manage the inventory of donated goods. \n \nLessons from previous operations. The project builds on a relationship between ADB \n23. \nand Jointown that began when ADB approved the 2-year local currency loan to Jointown for the \nCOVID-19 Emergency Response Project (footnote 3). Since then, ADB has expanded its COVID-\n19 response as the pandemic has spread worldwide. The earlier transaction with Jointown has \ntaught  ADB  the  importance  of  having  a  sophisticated  logistical  network  of  pharmaceutical \nproducts and medical supplies to meet a sudden increase in demand related to the pandemic. \nWhile  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  abated  in the  PRC,  the  prolonged  global health  crisis  and \nresulting economic crisis make it vital that ADB continues to be ready to ensure health security \nby responding to the evolving needs of DMCs and the private sector. \n \nD. \n \n24. \n \n25. \n \nE. \n \n26. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.13 \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nThe National Medical Products Administration is the main agency in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) for regulating drugs and medical devices. It was established in 2018 as \npart  of  the  State  Administration  for  Market  Regulation.  Its  main  responsibilities  include \ndrafting  laws  and  regulations  for  drugs,  medical  devices,  and  cosmetics;  regulating  the \nregistration of drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics; and managing the standards of the \npharmaceutical  industry.  Other  relevant  regulatory  bodies  include  the  National  Health \nCommission,  the  Ministry  of  Human  Resources  and  Social  Security,  and  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission. \n \nKey legislation for the pharmaceutical industry includes the Drug Administration Law and \nits  implementing  rules.  The  law  was  first  implemented  in  1984  and  the  last  major \namendment was in August 2019. The National Medical Products Administration has issued \na wide range of other regulations and measures to guide the pharmaceutical industry. \n \nPrice control of pharmaceutical drugs in the PRC was previously based on a scheme of \nmaximum retail drug prices set by the National Development and Reform Commission. In \nJune 2015, the government abolished this scheme with the exception of price controls for \ncertain drugs. In July 2017, a \u201czero-mark-up\u201d policy for public hospitals was introduced to \nensure that the price of pharmaceutical drugs charged by public hospitals to patients would \nbe the same as that paid to suppliers.   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nNovember 2020\u2013October 2025 \n \n\nManagement \nImplementation period \nOperations arrangements \n\n \n\n13 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nAspects \n \n \n \nmaintenance \n\nRevenue structure \nMajor cost structure \nOperation and \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nArrangements \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n[CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED]  Each  subproject  subsidiary  will  enter  into \nseparate  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contracts  with  subcontractors. \nJointown,  at  the  group  level,  will  centrally  coordinate  the  construction  of  each  center. \nJointown  will  comply  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Procurement  Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time).  \nJointown will provide quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements to ADB. \nJointown will also report key performance indicators, including development indicators on \na regular basis. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. \n \nF. \n \n27. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide a 5-year senior secured loan of up to \u20ac30.0 million (or its equivalent in \n28. \nChinese  yuan)  to  finance  Jointown\u2019s  capital  expenditure  financing  needs  for  three  new  and/or \nexpanded facilities in Hainan, Hebei, and Jiangsu provinces and its working capital. The proceeds \nof ADB\u2019s loan and DEG\u2019s loan will expand Jointown\u2019s distribution capacity, and will expand access \nto and increase the availability of pharmaceuticals in the PRC.

External consultants conducted an audit \nof Jointown\u2019s existing corporate environmental and social management system (ESMS) and E&S \ncompliance audits of the three  pharmaceutical distribution facilities that will be financed by the \nADB loan.15  \n \n34. \nThe  audit  did  not  find  any  potential  significant  adverse,  irreversible,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented  E&S  impacts  that  may  be  caused  by  the  construction  and/or  expansion  and \noperation of the three pharmaceutical distribution facilities. Jointown\u2019s pharmaceutical distribution \nfacilities, including those that will be financed by the ADB loan, are within government-established \nindustrial  zones  equipped  with  ancillary  services  such  as  water  and  power  supply,  waste \ncollection,  and  wastewater  treatment.  There  are  no  natural  habitats;  critical  habitats;  legally \nprotected areas; or areas with cultural, historical, or religious significance within the project sites. \nJointown confirmed during due diligence that the three pharmaceutical distribution facilities are \ndesigned to withstand floods that may be caused by extreme weather events. Climate change \nimpact  from  the  project  will  be  minimal.  Jointown's resource  efficiency  program  includes  using \ninformation  technology  for  efficient  warehouse  management  and  delivery  fleet  movement; \nefficient insulation, air conditioning and lighting; installation of roof-top solar panels; and piloting \nelectric trucks as potential future alternative to diesel trucks. Land for each of the government-\nestablished  industrial  zones  was  acquired  by  the  government  by  using  national  laws  and \nregulations  concerning  notification  and  compensation.  The  audit  found  that  there  were  no \noutstanding compensation issues or grievances at any of the sites. It is not anticipated that any \nof the facilities will require any additional land and, therefore, there will be no economic or physical \ndisplacement as a result of involuntary resettlement. The audit also determined that the locations \nof the facilities are not inhabited, used, or claimed by potentially vulnerable ethnic minorities. As \nsuch, there will be no activities that will directly and/or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, \ntraditional  sociocultural beliefs  and  practices,  and  livelihood  systems  of  distinct  and  potentially \nvulnerable ethnic minority groups. \n \n35. \nJointown  has  an  existing  ESMS  which  is  cascaded  from  the  corporate  level  to  the \npharmaceutical  distribution  facilities.  The  audit recommended  corrective actions to  ensure  that \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  procedures  during  construction  and  operations  are \nadequate and compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and other social requirements. \nSpecifically, Jointown must: (i) adopt an enhanced ESMS by developing and updating existing \nstandard  operating  procedures  for  screening,  categorizing,  and  for  reviewing  of  potential  risks \nand impacts on environment, involuntary resettlement and ethnic minorities (indigenous peoples) \nrelated  to  new  pharmaceutical  distribution  facilities  and  expansion  of  existing  pharmaceutical \n\n \n\n14 ADB.
