These \ninclude (i) promotion of vocational and skills training to ensure continuing \nimprovement in national productivity; (ii) creation of jobs in the formal and \nnonformal sectors; (iii) an increase in agricultural productivity to create \njobs in rural areas; and (iv) the establishment of technical vocational \neducation and training (TVET) networks to assist both men and women, \nespecially the poor, disabled and vulnerable, to respond to labor market \nneeds.  \n \nThe Project will help ensure an expanded public TVET system that is \nendorsed by industry and is better aligned with the skills requirements of \nthe formal and informal economies. The project will develop replicable \nmodels for transforming the system so it is more relevant to industry, \nfocusing initially on three industry sectors: mechanics, construction, and \nbusiness  services  and  information  and  communication  technologies \n(ICT). These models can be used as the basis for continued reform in \nother industry sectors.  \n \nThree outputs will be produced. The first will be better access to formal \nmid-level TVET that is linked to identified industry demand, and employs \nindustry-endorsed  skills  and  competency  standards  as  the  basis  for \ntraining.  Five  of  the  21  provincial  training  centers  (PTCs)  will  be \ntransformed into regional training centers (RTCs) to expand access to \nformal mid-level TVET programs in rural areas. Hostels for women will \nincrease their access to these programs. Independent industry advisory \ngroups, consisting primarily of employers, will be established in the three \nindustry sectors, and will review and endorse standards and curriculum \nand assessment procedures.  \n \nThe second output will be an extension of national access, especially of \nthe  young  and  unemployed,  to  the  nonformal  TVET  training  offered \nthrough  PTCs.  The  Voucher  Skills  Training  Program  (VSTP)  piloted \nunder  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Second  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  provides  basic  nonformal  short,  community-\nresponsive  skills  training  in  poor  communes.  It  will  be  revised  and ", "ii \nexpanded and will provide qualifications that allow course graduates to \nenter the next level of training. PTCs will be strengthened and helped to \nsupport  and  manage  the  program,  while  two  new  PTCs  will  be \nestablished to allow delivery of the VSTP in all 23 rural provinces.   \n \nThe third output will be stronger capacity for policy development, planning \nand management through support to the Directorate General of Technical \nand Vocational Education and Training (DGTVET) of the Ministry of Labor \nand  Vocational  Training  (MOLVT),  provincial  offices  and  training \ninstitutions. Two policy studies will establish the long-term direction and \ndevelopment  of  the  TVET  system,  and  explore  ways  of  improving \nfinancing. Subsequently, a new Medium Term TVET Development Plan \nand Medium Term Expenditure Framework, 2011\u20132015 will be formulated. \nManagement information and labor market information systems will be \ndeveloped to improve system management and planning. Career guidance \nin  schools  and  a  system  for  disseminating  career  advice  will  also  be \ninstituted. \n   \nRationale  Current public TVET provision does not fully meet the need for basic and \nmid-level skills in the formal and informal economies. Lack of access to \nformal  training  on  a  national  basis,  weak  links  with  industry,  lack  of \nentrepreneurial focus, poor quality control, and inadequate institutional \nfinancing continue to limit the quantity and quality of system output.   \n \nThe  current  global  economic  downturn  has  increased  the  need  for \nstrategies  that  will  lead  to  a  wider,  more  internationally  competitive \nproduction base. Greater investment in formal vocational skills formation \nis essential to ensure the expansion of the skilled labor force, and a \nsubstantial increase in productivity through more effective and efficient \ntraining.    \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project is expected to expand the employment-ready, national mid-\nlevel workforce in both rural and urban areas. By 2020, it is expected that \nthere will be at least a 30% increase in the number of employees holding \nformal  TVET  qualifications,  and  greater  employer  satisfaction  with \nemployees holding new formal TVET qualifications.  \n \nThe  expected  outcome  is  an  expanded  and  more  integrated  training \nsystem that is endorsed by industry and better aligned with the basic and \nmid-level skills requirements of the formal and informal economies in the \nthree industry sectors of mechanics, construction and business services \nand ICT. Key success indicators by 2015 will include (i) a 20% increase \nin enrollments in the three sectors; (ii) a 25% increase in the number of \ngraduates  from  formal  programs  in  the  three  sectors;  (iii)  a  400% \nincrease in national access to nonformal, basic skills training programs \nrequested by communities; (iv) a 20% increase in the number of women \ngraduating from formal courses in RTCs and polytechnics or institutes; \n(v) at least 50% of all participants in the nonformal VSTP programs to be \nwomen; (vi) 40% of nonformal VSTP training to be enterprise- or  center-\nbased  and  (vii)  40%  of  graduates  from  enterprise-  and  center-based \nVSTP training to be placed in full-time employment or self-employment. ", "iii \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $27.52  million, \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $2.06 million. \n \nFinancing Plan  An  Asian  Development  Fund  grant  of  $24.50  million  is  proposed, \nsupported by $3.02 million from the Government of Cambodia. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 February 2010\u201331 July 2015 \n   \nEstimatedProject  31 January 2015 \n \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT) \n   \nImplementation  MOLVT will be the Executing Agency and DGTVET the Implementing \nArrangements  Agency. DGTVET will establish the project coordination unit (PCU) under \nthe guidance of the project director (the secretary of state), who will \noversee overall project implementation. The PCU will be headed by a \nproject  coordinator  (the  director  general,  DGTVET),  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation,  planning  and \nbudgeting,  procurement,  disbursement,  monitoring,  supervising, \noverseeing of implementation in the training institutions, and submitting \nthe required reports to the Government and ADB.  \n \nThe PCU will have at least 15 staff members, including procurement, \nfinance, monitoring, and administrative staff. Project implementation will \noccur  through  all  departments  of  DGTVET,  with  selected  technical \nspecialists from each department supporting the implementation of the \nproject's  technical  programs  and  working  closely  with  the  relevant \nconsultants.   \n \nThe National Training Board will act as the steering committee, chaired \nby a Deputy Prime Minister, and will provide overall guidance to the \nProject  on  general  policy  and  strategic  directions,  and  ensure \ncoordination with the concerned ministries and institutions. \n   \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  goods,  works  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be \nprocured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time).  \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  be  supported  by  600  person-months  of  consultancy \nservices  (160  person-months  international  and  440  person-months \nnational).  The  consultants  will  provide  technical  support  for \nimplementation,  system  and  institutional  monitoring,  training  and  staff \nupgrading,  and  project  monitoring.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The project implementation consultants will be \nengaged through a firm on the basis of quality- and cost-based selection \nwith an 80:20 weighting. Individual consultants will be engaged to give \ndirect support to the PCU. DGTVET will be responsible for selecting and \nhiring consultants.   \n ", "iv \nProject Benefits and  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  proposed  project  will  be  the  267,000 \nBeneficiaries  trainees: 2,200 in formal TVET institutions and 54,000 taking 1\u20136 month \ncourses and 210,000 taking nonformal training under the VSTP in PTCs.  \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  will  be  the  rural  underemployed,  including \nworkers recently displaced from the garment and other industries hit hard \nby the global financial crisis. The VSTP trainees will receive skills that will \nraise  their  productivity  and  incomes.  By  helping  to  provide  higher \nincomes  and  greater  economic  activity  for  this  otherwise  low-skilled, \nunderemployed and low-income section of the population, the country as \na whole will benefit.    \n \nThe upgrading of teacher training and the development of new industry \nstandards and curricula will benefit about 600 TVET trainee teachers per \nyear. The graduate teachers will be more capable of delivering mid-level \nskills training of the type and quality the modern corporate sector requires. \nThe major benefits from the establishment of the five RTCs will be (i) 1,350 \nnew skilled graduates per annum entering the labor market; (ii) greater \naccess to mid-level training for school-leavers outside the Phnom Penh \nregion; and (iii) improved and safer access for young women in provincial \nareas.  \n \nOther direct beneficiaries will include instructors and administrative staff \nin all formal and nonformal training institutions; and the staff of DGTVET \nand  the  provincial  offices  of  the  Labor  and  Vocational  Training \nDepartment.  \n   \nRisks and  The Government places a high priority upon TVET and it is assumed that \nAssumptions  this will continue into the medium term. Although there is a risk that a \ndelay in the global recovery could reduce the impact of this strategy in \nthe short term, over the longer term it will assist in lifting the skills and \nproductivity of workers. A closer aligning of local labor force skills with \nindustry requirements will allow Cambodian skilled workers to replace \nforeign skilled workers.   \n   \nWhile the TVET system will continue to focus on nonformal, rural-based \ntraining to improve livelihoods, the Government's reform agenda proposes \na parallel focus on formal, better quality vocational training to create a \nmore highly skilled, internationally competitive workforce.  \n \nAnother  important  assumption  is  that,  with  a  more  accessible  TVET \nsystem that is more relevant to industry and produces more appropriately \ntrained graduates, trust by enterprises in the employment-readiness of \nTVET graduates will grow. It is also assumed that, with more positive \nemployment  outcomes  from  TVET-level  skilled  training,  more  school \nleavers  and  graduates  will  seek  vocational  training.  Reforms  to  be \nundertaken  by  the  Project  to  strengthen  industry  links  and  introduce \ncareer  counseling  and  job  placement  services  will  increase  the \nappreciation of vocational training among students and their families.    ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \ngrant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education \nand Training Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The  Cambodian  economy  is  in  transition  and  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  global \neconomic and financial turmoil.  Until recently, its traditional agrarian economy was largely \ninsulated from external influences, but even the rural sector has been affected by the current \neconomic crisis.   \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Most labor force participants are employed in the agricultural sector; in 2004, 24% of \nlabor force participants had either no or only some formal education; a further 43% had not \ncompleted primary school; and over 75% were own account workers or employed as unpaid \nfamily workers. Only about 15% of employment is wage employment in the private sector. \nOfficial figures indicate that very few of those employed as mid-level technicians or in craft \ntrades have technical vocational education and training (TVET), and most have only low levels \nof formal schooling.1  \n \n4.  Over 80% of Cambodians still live in rural areas, and about 68% of the labor force is \nemployed in agriculture. However, productivity is low and agriculture's contribution to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) was only 7% in 2007.  The manufacturing sector is small, employing \nonly about 9% of the labor force in 2008, but it comprised 23% of GDP. The manufacturing \nsector also led the growth in GDP and non-agricultural employment over the decade prior to the \nworldwide economic downturn in 2008. The garment industry is by far the largest area of \nmanufacturing,  accounting  for  almost  75%  of  all  manufacturing,  90%  of  manufacturing  jobs \ngrowth, and 70% of export revenue in 2008. The services sector is the largest contributor to GDP, \naccounting for almost 42% of GDP, and is the second largest employer after agriculture. From \n2003\u20132008, employment growth in the services sector was dominated by tourism.   \n \n5.  Cambodia suffers from low productivity in its main economic sectors in comparison with \nother countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations, and with the People's Republic of \nChina and India. Employment losses due to the economic downturn have been significant, \nespecially in the garment industry, although the most likely outcome is underemployment rather \nthan unemployment.  Many of the least-skilled who have been retrenched have returned to their \nrural communities to work as unpaid family workers and own-account workers. The recovery of \neconomic growth and development is linked to the global economy. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the World Bank have both identified a lack of adequate investment in formal \nvocational skills training and a shortage of skilled labor as impediments to a speedy recovery, \nand to improvement in sector productivity.  \n \n6.  Technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  system.  This  system  is  in  its \ninfancy as a discrete post-school vocational training system that emerged from the Ministry of \n                                                 \n1  There is no up-to-date, detailed information on employment in the mid-level occupations (International Standard \nClassification of Occupations 2008 major occupational groups 3 to 8), for which TVET provides the skills training. \nThe last labor force survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics was in 2001, and the latest occupational \nstatistics are from the intercensal population survey of 2004. ", "2   \nEducation, Youth and Sport (MOEYS) in 2005 with the creation of the Ministry of Labor and \nVocational Training (MOLVT). The National Training Board (NTB) is the apex body for TVET \npolicy formation and for the approval of strategies to implement that policy. The NTB is chaired \nby a deputy prime minister and includes senior representatives of all ministries involved in \neconomic  development  and  training.  There is  also  limited  private  sector  membership.  The \nDGTVET acts as the secretariat for the NTB. The National TVET Development Plan, 2006\u2013\n2011 identifies economic development and poverty alleviation as the twin thrusts of the TVET \nsystem. The summary subsector assessment is in Appendix 2.  \n \n7.  The  public  TVET  system  managed  by  MOLVT  is  essentially  supply-driven  and \ncomprises  25 provincial training centers (PTCs) delivering nonformal programs in rural areas; \nand 11 polytechnics and institutes delivering formal TVET courses from post-lower secondary to \ndegree  level  to  a  predominantly  urban-based  population.  Some  health  and  agriculture \ninstitutions are still managed by their respective ministries, but come under the NTB. In addition \nprivate providers and nongovernment organizations offer mostly short nonformal programs. \nEnterprises conduct their own in-house training, including apprenticeship schemes. The system \nis small and remains largely uncoordinated and unregulated.   \n \n8.  Formal TVET is provided in polytechnics and technical institutes at certificate, diploma \nand degree level. Courses last longer than 1 year. In 2008, there were only 2,200 graduates \nfrom certificate and diploma courses, of whom just over 1,500 were graduates of technical \nprograms. A further 765 graduated with a TVET bachelor's degree, about half of which were in \ntechnical fields. Despite a 90% unemployment rate for recent university graduates, the number \nof students in TVET degree programs continues to increase while nondegree programs are \nlosing students. Most of the degree courses are in business studies and management, with the \ncertificate and diploma level focusing on technical and trades areas.  All except two of the \npolytechnics and institutes are in Phnom Penh.   \n \n9.  The formal TVET system recruits from lower-secondary graduates for certificate courses, \nand from upper-secondary graduates for diplomas and degrees. The Cambodian school system \nremains highly pyramidal, especially in rural areas, where only 30% of school starters reach grade \n9 and 9% reach grade 12. Nationally, 4,600 students complete grade 9 but do not continue to \ngrade 10. This is the feeder group for certificate programs. A further 90,500 drop out at grades 7, \n8 and 9 (81,000 of whom live in rural areas) and are generally ineligible to enter formal TVET.  \n  \n10.  High schools currently graduate about 40,000 grade 12 students per year, which is \nprojected to increase to 190,000 per year by 2015 if current trends continue. As only 10% of \ncurrent high school graduates can be accommodated in universities, the demand for alternative \nhigher education will grow dramatically. The formal TVET system can now absorb only 4,000 \nstudents annually, but more could be accommodated if facilities were better utilized.  Although \nthere is strong pressure to expand TVET programs at the upper level, further expansion needs \nto be linked to real employment growth and opportunities.  \n \n11.  Nonformal TVET is offered through the 25 PTCs that were established to provide short \nnonformal  training  programs  to  address  social  dislocation  and  poverty.  Programs  initially \nfocused on basic agriculture, construction, motor repair skills; crafts; and basic food processing. \nSubsequently, programs to provide extended training in 3\u20134 month programs in wider basic \ntechnical skills were developed largely through ADB project support under the First and Second ", "  3 \nEducation Sector Development Programs (ESDP).2 Such programs provide a continuing local \nsource of skills access in predominantly rural areas.  Short agricultural courses averaging 2 \nweeks still make up the majority of PTC programs (46%).  There are also courses of 3-4 months \nin technical trades (15%), textiles and garments (10%), hairdressing and beauty (5%), with \ncomputing,  tourism  and  hospitality,  business,  art,  design.  and  languages  making  up  the \nremaining 25%.  \n \n12.  The Voucher Skills Training Program (VSTP) successfully piloted a model for delivering \nlarge-scale nonformal programs to communes and villages in skills that they identified and \nrequested, with over 46,000 participants in 2008 alone. Most of this training was delivered in the \ncommunities.  The VSTP also encompasses short, more structured, courses delivered in the \nPTCs (e.g., motorcycle repair, small engine maintenance, weaving, and hairdressing), as well \nas  enterprise-based  training,  under  which  enterprises  are  contracted  to  provide  on-the-job \ntraining to individual trainees for about 4 months. Under the pilot VSTP, 60% of training was \ncommunity-based, 10% was delivered as short courses in PTCs, and 40% was enterprise-\nbased (see Supplementary Appendix A for a summary evaluation of the pilot).  \n \n13.  There is an array of other nonformal training, including that offered by private providers \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The major NGO provider of technical skills training \nis Don Bosco which has operated technical schools and training centers since 1991. Other \nnoninstitutional NGO provision varies widely depending on donor finance, and concentrates on \nnonformal agricultural provision, crafts, textiles and garments. The available registration data \nindicate that 30\u201350 organizations train 300\u2013500 people per year in short programs that last from \n1 week to 1 month.  About 750 private business concerns also offer fee-paying services, of \nwhich almost half are in Phnom Penh.  The majority (60%) offer computer training and/or \nEnglish,  or  are  private  driving  schools  or  dancing  academies.  A  further  30%  are  small \nbusinesses (e.g., auto repair and electrical maintenance) which offer informal apprenticeships \nthrough a pay-and-work arrangement.  \n \n14.  TVET instructors are recruited from the ranks of degree and diploma holders in relevant \nfields, but low salaries make it difficult to attract candidates with up-to-date industrial and \nenterprise experience. After completing pedagogical training in the National Technical Training \nInstitute (NTTI), they can teach in a polytechnic, technical institute, or PTC. Among polytechnic \nand  institute  teachers,  one-third  have  a  master's  degree  and  two-thirds  an  undergraduate \ndegree or diploma. About 90% of PTC staff have a degree or diploma. About 75% of instructors \nhave completed 12 months of pedagogical training at NTTI.  However, this training does not \nprepare  instructors  adequately  in  community  and  enterprise  development,  in  working  with \nindustry, in understanding the employment market, microenterprise support, career guidance, \nor,  most  importantly,  hands-on  practical  skills  in  their  technology.  The  result  is  a  poor  fit \nbetween the skills of the teaching staff and the needs of enterprises, particularly in technical \nfields.  To  compensate,  most  institutions  hire  part-time  staff  with  more  current  knowledge. \nHowever, as their hourly rate far exceeds that of full-time staff, they are primarily assigned to \nfee-paying programs, where they generally contribute little to institutional development and their \nskills and knowledge are rarely transferred. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001.

Manila.  \n \n ", "4   \n15.  National qualifications framework (NQF). There is currently no NQF or approved skills \nstandards. However, the Government recognizes that an NQF is critical for the overall education \nand training system. An NQF is a unified system of national qualifications covering schools, \nvocational education and training, and the higher education sector. It links together all of these \nqualifications into a national system of educational recognition and provides flexible pathways \nbetween different education and training sectors (e.g., between TVET and higher education). As \nan initial step, MOLVT has agreed to focus on the TVET band of the NQF and to create a \nnational vocational qualifications framework (NVQF) until the full framework can be agreed. \n16.  Financing.    Since  it  was  established,  the  Directorate  General  of  Technical  and \nVocational Education and Training (DGTVET) has received an annual average funding increase \nof 45%, bringing the 2009 budget to $2.55 million. Almost half of this ($1.2 million) was allocated \nto training programs, with 45% for nonformal training and 55% for formal training. Per capita \nspending on nonformal training has varied considerably, but under the VSTP it was generally \ntoo low, especially for enterprise-based training, and needs to be raised to include the cost of \neffective monitoring.  Per capita spending on formal training is quite high at $143 for 2007 and \n2008, or 32.5% of per capita GDP, compared with $123 (28% of per capita GDP) for higher \neducation. Government institutions may not charge fees to students who gain places in full-time \npost secondary programs through the public examination system. Institutions receive a grant \nfrom Government to cover recurring costs and staff salaries are paid centrally. However, many \ninstitutions also cater to fee-paying private students, whose fees are set to at least cover costs.  \nIn  some  cases,  private  students  outnumber  regular  (non-fee-paying)  students.  There  is  a \nsignificant  demand  for  fee-paying  post-secondary  education,  but  this  is  generally  not  for \ntraditional TVET occupations. Fee-paying courses generate significant revenues for institutions, \nbut can also skew their training priorities. Ambiguities in the enforcement of regulations mean \nthat institutions cannot build these revenues into their budgets. Their status as directly-managed \npublic institutions is a clear disincentive to revenue generation.   \n \n17.  Performance.  In 2008, the formal TVET system produced just under 2,200 graduates, \nfor a labor force of roughly 7.5 million people. Of these, 1,500 graduated from technician-craft-\ntrades courses; the remainder were from management, business studies and information and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT).  Only  0.8%  of  the  literate  adult population  holds  a  TVET \nqualification. The small size of the system greatly reduces the capacity of TVET to contribute to \nthe country's economic development. Furthermore, the formal system remains largely supply-\ndriven. The nonformal training system under the PTCs, on the other hand, is widely regarded as \nsuccessful. An assessment of trainee income 6 months after VSTP training completion indicated \nthat more than 50% of program graduates reported their income had increased by at least 15%. \nThe evaluation identified ways in which the program could be improved, such as more effective \noversight  and  agreed  competency  and  financing  standards.  A  significant  drawback  is  that \nparticipants receive no certification and therefore cannot proceed to higher training. In general, \nmore  effective  system  regulation,  setting  of  standards,  and  integration  of  the  formal  and \nnonformal sectors to broaden training opportunities would strengthen the TVET system.  \n \n18.  ADB country strategy.  Since the early 1990s, ADB's country strategy has included the \nbuilding of national capacity for human development. Three earlier projects have laid a good \nfoundation for ADB's present and future work in TVET. The Basic Skills Project3 established the \nframework for development and management of the TVET system. In particular, this involved \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Basic Skills Project. Manila.  \n ", "  5 \nsetting up a National Training Board to oversee and coordinate all TVET and the National \nTraining  Fund  (NTF)  through  which  Government  funds  all  of  its  TVET  programs.  Other \nimportant elements included a national center for instructor training and curriculum development \nand a microcredit scheme, as well as improvement of training institutions. The First and Second \nEducation Sector Development Programs (ESDP) strengthened this emerging system through \nsupport for planning, management and monitoring, and further expansion and upgrading of \ntraining institutions (footnote 2). Extensive support for nonformal training was provided under \nthe Second ESDP, which successfully introduced the VSTP for rural basic skills training that is \nresponsive to community needs.   \n \n19.   Most successful TVET development interventions are long-term.  The Project is the \nlatest in a series of interventions that began in 1996 with the Basic Skills Project and continued \nthrough the two ESDPs, with the aim of creating a demand-driven TVET system that is demand \ndriven and relevant to industry. These projects and programs have put in place a sound policy \nframework and management structure, but the formal TVET system remains small and driven \nby supply rather than the needs of industry. The rural\u2013urban and nonformal\u2013formal training \ndivides restrict the opportunities for rural youth, while the academic entry requirements for \nformal courses and the lack of training pathways between the formal and nonformal systems \nclose off further training opportunities for many. This Project addresses these shortcomings by \ndeveloping models for a system that is more relevant to industry. The first steps will involve \nbuilding  a  more  integrated  system  by  systematizing  and  upgrading  nonformal  training, \nexpanding access to formal courses in rural areas, developing an NVQF and skills standards, \nand devising procedures to allow progress from the nonformal to the formal system. Replicating \nthe  model  into  other  industry  sectors,  developing  a  full  NQF,  and  assuring  the  pathways \nbetween nonformal and formal training will be carried out in the next project.     \n \n20.  Government policy. The national socioeconomic planning framework for Cambodia is \nthe Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Phase II, which was launched in September 2008. Its \nstrategies include improvements to productivity and diversification of agriculture, private sector \ndevelopment,  employment  generation,  and  human  resource  development.  The  National \nStrategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006\u20132010, based on the Rectangular Strategy, reiterates \nthe importance of capacity building and human resource development. Stated strategies include \n(i) promotion of vocational and skills training; (ii) creation of jobs in both formal and informal \nsectors;  (iii)  an  increase  in  agricultural  productivity  to  increase  rural  employment;  and  \n(iv) the establishment of TVET and training networks to assist  both men and women, especially \nthe poor, disabled and vulnerable, to respond to labor market needs.  \n \n21.  The NSDP is implemented through detailed plans from each ministry. The Strategic Plan \nof the MOLVT, 2006\u20132010 identifies strategies designed to develop the economy and reduce \npoverty, including the development of technical and vocational skills. The MOLVT plan aims to  \n(i) establish TVET links with enterprises; (ii) establish mechanisms for labor market information; \n(iii) service both formal and informal sectors; (iv) upgrade TVET through a NVQF, competency \nstandards and testing, training of trainers, and accreditation of TVET programs and institutions;  \n(v) modernize training facilities and equipment; (vi) strengthen local planning for local training \nneeds; (vii) establish new centers in unserved provinces; (viii) expand TVET provision through \nthe NTF to reduce poverty more widely; (ix) encourage certificate-based TVET programs in all \nprovinces and municipalities; and (x) encourage TVET institutions to generate their own income. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n22.  There are several major issues relating to the Government's expectation of TVET, the \n ", "6   \nlack of interest in TVET training among Cambodia's urban youth, and the low quality and \nrelevance of existing programs.  \n \n23.  Technical and vocational education and training has a dual role. TVET is typically the \nprimary source of mid-level craft, trades and technician skills training for those seeking to enter \nthe labor force for the first time; workers already in the labor force seeking to upgrade their skills; \nand those wishing to re-enter the labor force. The focus is primarily on mid-level occupations. The \nTVET system produces technicians, para-professionals, and skilled workers and is integral to the \ngrowth and development of all sectors of a modern economy, providing training in the core skill \nrange employed in most agricultural, industrial and service sector operations.  \n \n24.  However, in Cambodia, the TVET system plays a dual role.  With 80% of the population \nliving  outside  the  cities  and  industrializing  areas,  poverty  alleviation  interventions  must  be \ndirected primarily at rural communities. TVET has a broad focus\u2014it is expected to help improve \nagricultural productivity through training and, coupled with increased microfinance, to provide \nthe rural population with livelihood skills for self-employment. At the same time, the Government \nrecognizes that the economy needs to diversify, and to do so it needs to attract new investment \nand new industries. The TVET system is expected to provide the pool of skilled labor that can \ncontribute to greater productivity in existing industries and help to attract investment in new, \ncompetitive industries. This dual requirement would be demanding in any circumstances, but is \nespecially so in a new system with limited capacity and resources.   \n \n25.  The two training systems that have arisen to meet these different demands are run as \nlargely separate systems. In addition to the geographical divide (in general, nonformal courses \nare offered in rural areas and formal training in urban areas), there are further divides in the \ntypes of institutions offering the training, in their funding and operations, and, importantly, in \ntheir certification. While formal training programs are certified, nonformal programs are not. \nGraduates of nonformal course cannot enter formal courses on the basis of their nonformal \ntraining, nor can they receive credit for other training. Indeed, people who have not graduated \nfrom grade 9 cannot enter formal training. This lack of pathways between the two systems is a \nsevere constraint on increased equity, efficiency, and broadened access to TVET.  \n \n26.  Low demand for technical training.  While the demand for places in nonformal TVET \ncourses in agriculture and livelihood skills is high, the demand for TVET training places in \ntechnical  and  trades  areas  is  relatively  low.  The  growth  in  student  numbers  in  the  post-\nsecondary TVET institutions is largely at the degree level, and, in response to student demand, \nit is biased toward business and commerce rather than mid-level technical skills. However, until \nthe recent downturn, the economy generated about 50,000 new wage jobs per year, of which it \ncan be assumed that about 65%\u201370% were in mid-level skilled occupations. Skill shortages \ntherefore  sat  side-by-side  with  substantial  unemployment  and  underemployment.    Market \ndemand has been met by employers recruiting foreign workers, and/or by taking on unskilled \nschool leavers.  Some of these they have trained themselves, while others have been left to \nperform at productivity levels below those of their counterparts across the region.   \n \n27.  The  drop  in  demand  may  be  linked  to  both  increasing  participation  rates  in  upper \nsecondary schooling, and the urban\u2013rural divide in formal training provision. In urban areas, \n90% of grade 9 students continue to grade 10, giving many of these students the chance to \nenter degree programs. The transition rate in rural areas is 80%. However, rural students who \nwish to take formal vocational courses must currently relocate to Phnom Penh. This can be \ndifficult as many TVET trainees come from the middle to lower income groups. Moving to the \ncapital is even more difficult for girls as they require supervised accommodation. As a result, ", "  7 \nalmost 5,000 students, or 20% of those currently taking uncertified nonformal courses in PTCs, \nhave completed grade 9. Students living in rural areas need access to formal TVET training in \nmid-level skills. \n \n28.  The changing structure of enrollments in the general education system has implications \nfor TVET programs. There are two issues. First, there is a high (50%) dropout from lower \nsecondary education (approximately 133,000 students in school year 2007/08).  This group is \nineligible  for  formal  TVET  courses  as  all  have  a  minimum  entry  requirement  of  a  lower \nsecondary school pass. Second, there is now a very high transition rate from lower secondary to \nupper secondary school, meaning that if a student does complete grade 9, he or she is very \nlikely  to  continue  to  grade  10.  This  means  that  the  traditional  source  of  recruitment  for \nCambodia's TVET certificate courses is drying up.4  The current structure of TVET programs \nmay not be pitched at the right level, as formal entry-level programs are currently geared toward \nan ever-shrinking group of students who have completed grade 9 while failing to serve a very \nlarge group of grade 7\u20139 school leavers. A complete rethink and revamp appears necessary.  \n \n29.  There are rigidities in the system which limit the attractiveness of TVET to young people. \nAt present, students cannot move from nonformal to formal TVET without completing lower \nsecondary school. There is no formal equivalence either between TVET qualifications and \ngeneral education qualifications, which means that students who choose TVET cannot move \nback  into  the  general  education  system  without  additional  study.  Consequently,  TVET \ninstitutions now offer their own bachelor degrees. A system that allows study pathways at all \nlevels would enhance the relevance and attractiveness of TVET as a study and career choice.   \n \n30.  There is a general lack of awareness of TVET careers and the availability of skills \ntraining programs. Further, institutions, instructors and curricula are not adequately focused on \nthe major issue of employment. To address this, MOLVT has just announced that it will open \nnew job centers, in association with the International Labour Organization (ILO), that will bring \ntogether employers, potential workers, and training providers. Better matching of TVET trainees \nwith vacancies for skilled jobs should eventually increase TVET demand. A comprehensive \nprogram  of  career  guidance  and  counseling  in  secondary  schools  at  the  provincial  and \nmunicipal  levels  will  be  put  in  place.  The  PTCs  will  support  this  by  conducting  outreach \nprograms in schools to introduce TVET as a viable pathway to employment after graduation. For \nTVET to be acceptable to secondary school graduates, it must be seen to lead to employment.  \n \n31.  Skills supply and demand mismatch.  The combination of growing demand for skilled \nlabor, the limited supply of TVET, and the lack of close links with industry has contributed to a \nshortage of skilled workers in particular fields, which can inhibit economic growth. A recent \nWorld Bank study5 found that, while there was no evidence of generalized skill constraints in \nCambodia, technical and vocational training was an exception, with evidence of mismatches \nbetween the skills required in the labor market and those being produced by post-secondary \neducational institutions.  A key aspect of this mismatch is that post-secondary institutions tend \nto produce too many generalists (e.g., managers) and too few graduates with specific skills \n(e.g.,  accounting  or  information  technology).  A  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP) study in May 20096 found that a lack of skills and a poorly trained workforce were \n                                                 \n4  There is a higher dropout rate (30%) at the grade 10 level, especially in rural areas. Nationally, 33,000 students \ndropped out of grade 10 in SY 2007/08, of whom  26,000 lived in rural areas.  Some of these students could be \ntargeted for TVET programs.   \n5  World Bank. 2007.

According to the \nstudy, Cambodia suffers from a lack of highly trained workers across a range of vocational skill \nareas, including construction (e.g., carpenters, electricians, welders, architects, and engineers) \nand information technology.  Employers have responded to such shortages by hiring skilled \nworkers from neighboring countries, a point that is echoed by the World Bank and a United \nStates Agency for International Development survey of garment manufacturers in 2006.7  The \nWorld Bank and UNDP recommend TVET reforms, including increasing the private sector role \nin the planning and delivery of vocational training.   \n \n32.  Poor  teaching  and  management.  With  a  few  exceptions,  the  quality  of  teaching \nthroughout both the public and private TVET system needs substantial improvement.  The PTCs \nand polytechnics have few teaching resources, curricula are not linked to industry practice and \nstandards,  and  assessment  lacks  reliability  and  validity.    Almost  all  TVET  instructors  and \nteacher trainers lack industrial experience, with the result that theory is emphasized at the \nexpense of practice. This is reinforced by the absence of adequate, industry-relevant equipment \nand training facilities in most institutions. There are no national teacher competency standards, \nand there are no nationally approved curricula. Voluntary upgrading and updating of full-time \nteaching staff is rare and NTTI does not provide inservice training.  The preservice training \nprogram offered by NTTI is particularly unsuited to the work of PTCs. Most TVET instructors in 7 \nPTCs teach 3-month courses in such subjects as dressmaking, weaving, and small engine \nrepair. However, the instructors lack skills to help communities develop training requirements \nand to link microcredit with training to support demand-driven community-based education for \npoverty alleviation.  \n \n33.  Only one-third of PTCs are managed effectively. A further one-third need improvement, \nwhile the remaining one-third are considered moribund. A survey of PTCs has indicated that the \nthere are a few exceptional institutions that are managed effectively. Through an entrepreneurial \napproach, these directors have managed to mobilize support from the local community, from \nlocal enterprises, and other nongovernment sources. The same applies to polytechnics. The \nbest  PTC  and  polytechnic  managers  provide  a  source  of  guidance  on  how  institutional \nmanagement  can  be  strengthened  and  made  more  relevant  to  managing  entrepreneurial \ninstitutions. Another issue that needs to be addressed is the fact that many curricula are rarely \nupdated after teachers complete their training. Any updating which does occur tends to be \nthrough the individual efforts of part-time teachers with regular jobs where they work with more \nrecent technology. Thus, curricula depend on the caliber of the teachers in each institution. \n \n34.  Weak industry links.  Despite the existence of the NTB, industry does not appear to be \nactively involved in the planning and development of TVET at the national level.  The same is \ntrue at the institutional level, with few public institutions having industry advisory bodies, industry \ninput into curriculum development, tracer studies of graduate employment, or on-the-job training \nthrough  student  placements.  As  a  result,  training  programs  are  not  meeting  the  needs  of \nemployers.  The USAID study of the garment sector (footnote 7) found that employers hired \nforeign workers because they were unable to find mid-level, skilled Cambodian technicians and \nmanagers.     \n \n35.  Other external support.  ADB\u2019s initial support to TVET built on support from the United \nNations Development Programme and ILO that began in the early 1990s and initially focused on \nbasic employment training for returnees, the displaced, demobilized soldiers, and female heads of \n                                                 \n7  Nathan Associates, Inc. 2006.

Subsequent  initiatives  supported  the  development  of  skills  for  training  needs \nassessment, curriculum and program development and instructor training.  Assistance to MOEYS \nwas provided by German development assistance through GTZ to develop recommendations for \na national training framework and staff training, and to plan an integrated national TVET system. \nADB\u2019s broad support for general education and TVET over the following decade has been further \nenhanced  by  specific  support  from  other  donors.  This  included  (i)  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency support (1990\u20132000) for an automotive training and auto repair center, and \nongoing  provision  of  specialist  volunteers  across  several  of  the  MOLVT  training  institutions;  \n(ii)  Republic  of  Korea  development  assistance  (2005\u20132009)  for  skills  standards  and  the \nestablishment of the National Polytechnic Institute of Cambodia; and (iii) grant assistance for the \nsupport of the Cambodia\u2013India Entrepreneurship Development Center from the India Technical \nand Economic Cooperation, 2004\u20132007. A National Garment Training Institute, proposed for \nfunding by the Garment Manufacturers' Association of Cambodia and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement, may provide a model for future public\u2013private TVET initiatives in key sectors \n(see Appendix 3 for a summary of external assistance).  \n \nC.  Lessons Learned \n \n36.  Industry links are the single most important factor in TVET success, as measured by \nemployment  outcomes.  In  Cambodia,  links  between  the  TVET  system  and  industries  and \nenterprises are ad hoc. The NTB provides a potential bridge between the training system and \nindustry  but  it  focuses  more  on  policy  development  and  system  governance  than  on  the \npractical  work  of  developing  standards,  qualifications,  and  assessment  practices  that  are \nrelevant to industry.  In other countries, sector-specific industry training bodies have been \nestablished and these are also proposed for this Project in the form of industry advisory groups, \nto be established in the three industry sectors. Experience shows that industry must have \nownership of the standards and play a major role in the assessment of trainees.  Lessons from \ntwo  evaluations  of  VSTP  pilots8 have  been  incorporated  to  ensure  that  the  new  national \nprogram will (i) have a better balance between enterprise-based skills training and agricultural \nskills, (ii) give greater power to communes and PTCs to make training more demand-driven and \nresponsive to community needs, (iii) give formal recognition for training, and (iv) provide training \nfor  microenterprise  development.  The  central  importance  of  entrepreneurial  institutional \nmanagement is also acknowledged through a comprehensive management training program.   \n \n37.  Project approach. As there is an absence of labor market data, it is not yet possible to \nidentify and address specific skills shortages with any validity, so the Project has not been \ndesigned to target specific shortages.  Instead, the objective is to build a platform for continued \nreform by developing replicable models so the system can be made more relevant to industry. \nThe key steps will include the establishment of industry advisory groups; the development of \nskills standards led by these groups; development of curricula and assessment procedures; \nretraining of instructors, including skills training; upgrading of facilities if needed; and training \ninstitute directors to operate in more enterprise-directed ways. Eventually this approach will \nneed to be replicated in all major employment sectors. \n \n                                                 \n8  MOLVT. 2008.

The Voucher Skills Training \nProgram: The Cambodian Experience in Seven Pilot Provinces. Phnom Penh. \n \n  \n \n ", "10   \n38.  The three sectors (mechanics, construction, and business services and ICT) were chosen \nto develop this model because they (i) represent general, mainstream skill areas with substantial \nnational coverage, (ii) are representative of skills provision in Cambodia, (iii)  cover both the lower \nand mid-levels of skills employment and (iv) are offered in all PTCs.  The selection was based on \ndata collected from employers and center directors, data on graduate placement and the rate of \ngrowth in these sectors, and training demand.  A further consideration for including business and \nICT is that it is the only area of TVET training where girls and young women are represented.  \n \n39.  The challenges identified in the TVET system can be addressed through complementary \nreforms to improve the quality of, and access to, nonformal and formal TVET. The longer-term \ngoal is a competency-based system that is responsive to the needs of industry and establishes \npathways  between  formal  and  nonformal  training.  Within  nonformal  TVET,  VSTP  will  be \nexpanded and an urban VSTP piloted to achieve national access. VSTP will be supported by \nprograms to improve instructor performance, institutional management, program development \nand assessment, and links with the local community and potential employers in PTCs. Within \nformal TVET, the strategy will focus on developing replicable pilots in the three sectors, along \nwith support for the retraining of teacher trainers; development of new standards, qualifications, \ncurriculum  and  assessment  tools  that  are  relevant  to  industry;  and  better  institutional \nmanagement. Substantial support will be provided for management training, the development of \nan NVQF, a vocational education and training management information system (VETMIS), and \na labor market information system (LMIS) will strengthen the capacity of DGTVET to manage \nthe reform agenda.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n40.  The Project is expected to expand the employment-ready, national mid-level work force \nin both rural and urban areas. By 2020, it is expected that there will be at least a 30% increase \nin  the  number  of  employees  holding  formal  TVET  qualifications,  and  greater  employer \nsatisfaction with employees holding new formal TVET qualifications.  \n \n41.  The  expected  outcome  is  an  expanded,  enterprise-endorsed  and  more  integrated \ntraining system that will be better aligned to the basic and mid-level skills requirements of the \nformal and informal economies in mechanics, construction, and business services and ICT. Key \nsuccess indicators to be achieved by 2015 include (i) a 20% increase in enrollments in the three \nsectors; (ii) a 25% increase in the number of graduates from formal programs in the three \nsectors; (iii) a 400% increase in national access to nonformal, basic skills training programs \nrequested by communities, including microenterprise training; (iv) a 20% increase in the number \nof women graduating from formal courses in RTCs and polytechnics/institutes; (v) at least 50% \nof all participants in the nonformal VSTP programs to be women; (vi) 40% of nonformal VSTP \ntraining to be enterprise- or  center-based and (vii) 40% of graduates from enterprise- and \ncenter-based VSTP training to be placed in full-time employment or self-employment.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n42.  The Project will produce three outputs: (i) more industry-relevant formal training programs \nin mechanics, construction, and ICT and business; (ii) expanded and better quality nonformal \ntraining; and (iii) strengthened institutional capacity to plan and manage the TVET system. \n \n ", "  11 \n1.  Formal Programs that are more Relevant to Industry \n \n43.  The Project will improve access to formal TVET that is linked to the demands of industry \nand  will  use  industry-endorsed  skills  competency  standards  as  the  basis  for  the  training \ncurriculum, trainer training, training equipment, and an assessment of trainee performance. It \nwill also facilitate expanded access to formal training for girls.  \n \n44.  Upgrade five provincial training centers to regional training centers.  PTCs in five \nprovinces (Battambang, Kampot, Siem Reap, Svay Rieng and Takeo) will be expanded and \nupgraded to RTCs so they can offer formal TVET programs in rural areas at entry, mid-level, \nand technician levels in mechanics, construction, and ICT and business. The RTC training \nprograms will be based on the new standards and curriculum. In addition, the RTCs will be the \nvenue for regional inservice training for instructors, organized from the NTTI. The institutional \nmanagement  and  development  skills  of  the  RTC  directors  will  be  sharpened  through \ncomprehensive  training  and  mentoring.  ICT  training,  trainer  training  and  subject-  and \ntechnology-based upgrading will be provided to all RTC instructors. The Project will also support \nthe construction of hostels for female trainees in each RTC. The PTCs to be upgraded were \nchosen  on  the  basis  of  their  institutional  performance,  geographic  location  and  a  growing \nenterprise base that could absorb skilled graduates.   \n \n45.  Develop training modules based on skills standards and train trainers.  The Project \nwill  develop  competency  standards  for  mechanics,  construction,  and  ICT  and  business. \nCapacity will be built among lead teachers from the specialist institutes, trainers from NTTI, and \nsenior officers of DGTVET. In addition, curricula and learning materials for the new standards \nwill be produced for the PTCs and RTCs; equipment for the new curriculum will be installed; \nassessment procedures will be developed; and assessors trained. Effective implementation of \nthe new standards-based programs will be supported through regular training of all PTC and \nRTC teachers in TVET skills development and instructional techniques for the new curriculum.   \n \n46.  Increase  industry  involvement.  Independent  industry  advisory  groups  consisting \nprimarily  of  employers  will  be  established  in  each  industry  sector  to  review  standards, \nendorsement, and ongoing assistance in curriculum, training development, and assessment \nprocedures.  More contracting of small-scale employers for VSTP training will also occur, both \nthrough increased allocations of training hours and increased numbers of trainees.   \n \n47.  Strengthen  the  National  Technical  Training  Institute  for  system  upgrading. An \nimportant project initiative is the establishment of a new, integrated system to develop skills \nstandards, curriculum and training materials, and TVET teacher training. This will be achieved \nthrough the closer integration of institutions in pedagogy, technical skills development and \nentrepreneurship. NTTI will be the lead institution for teacher training and curriculum and three \nspecialist institutes in mechanics, construction, and ICT and business will be responsible for \ndeveloping skills standards and training models for the target industry sectors (the Industrial \nTechnical Institute, the National Institute of business and the Preah Kossomak Polytechnic \nInstitute). A fourth institute (the Cambodia-India Entrepreneurship Development Center) will be \nresponsible for entrepreneurship.  Each technology institution will bring together an industry \nadvisory group; provide technical direction for the development of skills standards; assist the \ndevelopment  of  curriculum  and  learning  materials;  support  the  training  of  assessors  from \nindustry; provide skills strengthening for NTTI trainees and in-service training; and monitor \ntraining in the PTCs. The technical skills of lead teachers from each institute will be upgraded \nthrough regional training, and training equipment to match the new curriculum will be provided. \nA postgraduate TVET teacher-training program will also be introduced (Appendix 4).   \n ", "12   \n2.  Expanded and Better Quality Nonformal Training  \n \n48.  The second output of the Project will extend national access to (i) nonformal TVET \ntraining (including in urban areas); (ii) training provision for the young and unemployed, female \nand  male;  and  (iii)  nonformal  programs  at  different  levels  that  yield  qualifications  allowing \ngraduates to enter the next level of training. \n \n49.  Establish provincial training centers in unserved provinces.  PTCs now exist in 21 \nof the 23 rural provinces. All PTCs target rural poverty alleviation through courses that relate \ndirectly to enhancement of family income. The Project will support the development of a PTC in \nthe provincial capitals in each of the two remaining rural provinces (Mondulkiri and Preah \nVihear), providing classrooms, workshops, equipment and teacher upgrading.  Women will \nmake up 50% of enrollments at the newly constructed PTCs in Mondulkiri and Preah Vihear. \nThe Project will also support the rehabilitation of existing PTCs as needed. \n \n50.  Extend  the  voucher  skills  training  program  to  all  provinces.  The  pilot  VSTP \nsupported the development and delivery of nonformal, community-responsive training in seven of \nthe poorest provinces, covering 90,000 participants. The communes selected received a \u201cvoucher\u2019 \nto fund training linked to local commune planning. Under this Project, a revised VSTP will be \nextended to all 24 provinces (with a further 210,000 participants). Provinces will progressively \nengage with the scheme, to allow strengthening and preparation of inexperienced PTCs.  Each \nprovince will be funded for a 2-year period. To improve the quality of training, the expanded \nVSTP will be modified through (i) reductions in group size in field-based training, (ii) greater \nemphasis on enterprise attachments and center-based training and combinations of both, (iii) new \nincentives for placing VSTP graduates in employment, and (iv) the implementation of a pilot urban \nVSTP. The pilot will be located in Phnom Penh and will be implemented in the automotive sector \nthrough  contracted  enterprise  placements,  administered  by  the  Japan  Vocational  Center,  a \ntraining institution under MOLVT. At least 50% of the recipients of training under the expanded \nand rural VSTP will be women (see Appendix 5 for more information on the VSTP).     \n \n51.  Develop directors and staff of provincial training centers. The Project will strengthen \nmanagement capacity in all 24 institutions to develop and manage demand-responsive training. \nPTC directors who implemented the pilot VSTP will mentor other directors. DGTVET confirms \nthat some of the best PTC directors are women, and they will play a key role in the training and \nmentoring strategy for other directors. Staff directly managing the VSTP will be trained in  \n(i) linking with small employers through informal apprenticeships, (ii) management and planning, \n(iii) finance, (iv) community outreach, entrepreneurship, and revenue generation, (v) provincial \ntraining board (PTB) support, (vi) career guidance and job placement for graduates, and (vii) \ndata reporting.   \n \n52.  Upgrade training on skills standards in the provincial training centers.  All PTC \ninstructors will be trained for the new curriculum through in-service training in the five RTCs.  \nEquipment will be provided to the PTCs to meet the training requirements of the three industry \nsectors. Assessment services and new procedures for recognition of prior learning will be \nprovided to give workers credit for training and to support progress to further training. Technical \nstaff from the NTTI complex and DGTVET will undertake regular mentoring and compliance \nvisits.  \n \n53.  Increasing  accessibility  to  structured  skills  training.  Currently,  graduates  from \nnonformal training in PTCs cannot continue to government-provided mid-level training unless \nthey have higher academic qualifications (i.e., they have completed lower secondary school). ", "  13 \nThe  Project  will  take  the  first  steps  toward  a  more  integrated  system  by  developing  new \ncourses, curricula and standards to systematize nonformal training by introducing pathways to \nhigher  levels  of  training  within  the  nonformal  system.  To  improve  the  pathways  between \nnonformal  and  formal  programs,  strategies  that  allowing  more  students  to  progress  from \nnonformal  to  mid-level  formal  programs  will  be  identified.  This  will  eventually  allow  PTC \ngraduates to enter mid-level programs in the RTCs and elsewhere.   \n \n3.  Strengthened  Institutional  Capacity  to  Plan  and  Manage  Technical  and \nVocational Education and Training \n \n54.  The Project will strengthen the capacity of DGTVET, provincial offices, and the training \ninstitutions in policy development, management and supervision; planning; budget preparation \nand disbursement; financial management and reporting requirements; information collection, \nprocessing,  analysis  and  dissemination;  quality  assurance;  and  system  governance  and \nsupport.    The  proposed  strategies  for  the  development  of  management  capacity  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D and the human resource development plan is in Supplementary \nAppendix E.   \n \n55.  Assess technical and vocational education and training policies. The evolution of \nthe Cambodian economy, changes in the educational and social preferences of Cambodians that \naffect demand for education, and dramatic improvements in access to basic education, suggest \nthat it is time to review the TVET policy framework in Cambodia. The Project will undertake a \ncomprehensive review of current policies, strategies and structures to identify the reforms needed \nto help match the system to the needs of industry while still serving the needs of those who lack \nacademic qualifications. The study will examine the levels of training, the qualifications offered, \nand pathways between different levels and types of training, as well as the regulatory and \nfinancing framework for the TVET system, the scope for public\u2013private partnerships in training \nprovision, and improved institutional financing.  A second study will look at potential sources of \nadditional financing, including a training levy. Both studies will help to ensure that the TVET \nsystem can develop according to the country's emerging needs and demands.    \n \n56.  Strengthen  planning  capacity. DGTVET will formulate a new Medium-Term TVET \nDevelopment Plan (MTTDP), a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, 2012\u20132014 and annual \noperational plans for 2010 to 2015.  The Project will support system planning through a senior \nlevel study tour on regional TVET policy for NTB and PTB members and senior officials. \nSupport will also be provided for annual NTB policy reviews as a basis for preparing the \nMTTDP, the annual plan, and the expenditure framework.   \n \n57.  Strengthen management capacity. To build a stronger system for DGTVET monitoring \nof  training  institutions,  officers  will  be  trained  in  system  management,  supervision  and \ndevelopment (Supplementary Appendix D). Financial management in PTCs and DGTVET will \nbe strengthened, as well as the institutional management and development skills of directors in \nall PTCs, RTCs, and polytechnics. All mid-level female DGTVET officers will be selected for \nregional  training,  while  50%  of  officers  selected  from  the  provincial  Labor  and  Vocational \nTraining Department will also be women. \n \n58.  Improve technical and vocational education and training information systems. \nSystem  management  and  planning  will  be  supported  by  the  design,  development,  and \ncommissioning  of  a  vocational  education  and  training  management  information  system \n(VETMIS) and a labor market information system (LMIS) to provide essential data on the \ntraining system and the skill requirements of industry. ICT facilities and training will be provided \nfor MOLVT and all of its training institutions and provincial offices. Gender- and, where relevant, \n ", "14   \nethnicity-disaggregated indicators, including those related to TVET outcomes, efficiency and \neffectiveness,  will  be  incorporated  into  the  VETMIS  and  LMIS.  Further  information  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n59.  Develop  and  implement  skills  standards.  The  expertise  and  systems  for  skills \nstandards development in partnership with industry will be supported, leading to the agreement \nof an NVQF by 2015. Project activities will target the three selected industry sectors to ensure \nfull  development  of  relevant  standards  and  capacity  building,  and  effective  industry  and \nenterprise links for later replication and extension to other skills areas. Training will be provided \nto relevant national and provincial officers in the development and implementation of the new \nnational  skills  standards-based  training  system  and  skills  assessment.  More  detail  on  the \ndevelopment and implementation of skills standards is in Appendix 6. \n \n60.  Introduce career information systems. The Project will develop and distribute career \nguidance materials for schools, and develop a web portal for dissemination of career guidance \ninformation, to encourage young people to take up vocational training and consider a related \ncareer. The materials and outreach activities will also encourage young women to take up \ntraining in nontraditional skills areas.  As a condition of involvement in the VSTP, PTCs will be \nrequired to designate a staff member to take responsibility for career guidance and employment \nplacement for graduates of the program (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n61.  Focused approach.  The Project will focus on only three industry sectors, which will be \nused as models for system and training development.  Previous projects have shown the difficulty \nof ensuring sustainable change across many sectors and institutions. The activities in each sector \nwill  focus  on  (i)  program  development  against  industry-approved  competency  standards,  \n(ii) training curriculum and skills testing, and (iii) teacher training in the new curriculum. The \nlessons learned from the initial three sectors will then be used in others.    \n \n62.  Policy and regulation. The project will contribute significantly to strengthening TVET \nmanagement by developing a wide range of policies, regulations, and strategies, including  \n(i) the MTTDP, (ii) annual development plans for TVET, (iii) VETMIS and LMIS, (iv) TVET \ninformation management policy, (v) NVQF; (vi) TVET institutions management regulation and \npolicy,  and  (vii)  financial  management  and  reporting  systems.  These  areas  are  crucial  for \nenhancing and strengthening the TVET system in Cambodia. \n \n63.  Industry  and  private  sector  participation.  A  significant  innovation  to  strengthen \nindustry involvement in TVET will be the establishment of sector-specific industry advisory \ngroups in the three priority sectors. These groups will be responsible for the development (or \nadaptation) of industry-relevant standards that specify the level of competence required for \nTVET  qualifications.  They  will  also  be  significantly  involved  in  assessing  the  competency \nattainment of trainees, and will advise the NTB on skill development needs in their sectors by \ndrawing up and regularly updating national sector skill development plans. These plans will \nassist the NTB to determine priorities for national vocational skill formation.   \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n64.  The project investment cost is estimated at $27.52 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.06  million  (7.5%)  and  contingencies  of  $2.49  million  (9.0%).  The  foreign  exchange \ncomponent  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $12.27  million  (44.6%)  while  the  local  currency \ncomponent is $15.25 million (55.4%). Expenditure on the VSTP is estimated to be $6.24 million ", "  15 \n(24.9% of the base cost); equipment and furniture $5.09 million (20.3%); consulting services \n$4.12 million (16.4%); civil works $3.30 million (13.2%); training $1.89 million (7.6%); surveys \nand studies $0.4 million (1.6%); learning materials $0.26 million (1.1%); and administrative \nsupport costs $3.75 million (15%).   \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n65.  The Government has requested a grant of $24.5 million from the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) to help finance the Project. The Government\u2019s contribution of $3.02 million will be in \nthe form of the land for the two new PTCs, accommodation for the PCU, additional DGTVET \nstaff, as well as taxes and charges foregone. The ADF grant will fund 89% of the proposed \nproject, with the Government accounting for the remaining 11% (Table 2).

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n66.  MOLVT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  DGTVET  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency.  DGTVET  will  establish  the  PCU  under  the  guidance  of  the  project  director  (the \nsecretary of state, MOLVT), who will oversee overall project implementation. The PCU will be \nheaded by a project coordinator (the director general, DGTVET) who will be responsible for day-\nto-day project implementation, planning and budgeting, procurement, disbursement, monitoring, \n ", "16   \nsupervising, overseeing of implementation in the training institutions, and submitting required \nreports to the Government and ADB. The project coordinator will be supported by an executive \nadministration officer. The PCU will have at least 15 staff members, including procurement, \nfinance, monitoring and reporting, and administrative staff. Project implementation will occur \nthrough all departments of DGTVET, with selected technical specialists from each department \nsupporting the implementation of the project's technical programs and working closely with the \nrelevant consultants. PCU activities will be assisted by an international finance consultant, an \ninternational monitoring and evaluation (M&E) consultant, a national M&E consultant, and a \nnational consultant in civil works and procurement. The NTB will act as the steering committee, \nchaired by a deputy prime minister, and will provide overall guidance to the Project on general \npolicy  and  strategic  directions,  and  ensure  coordination with  the  concerned  ministries  and \ninstitutions.  The project management structure is in Appendix 8. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n67.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from 1 February 2010 to 31 January 2015. \nThe implementation schedule is provided as Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n68.  All ADB-financed goods, works and services will be procured in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The project director, \nassisted by the project staff, will be responsible for all procurement. The indicative procurement \nplan and a procurement capacity assessment have been prepared, along with details of the \nproposed equipment and unit costs of inputs.  \n \n69.  Supply contracts for goods such as laboratory and workshop equipment estimated at \n$500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. \nSupply contracts for goods such as motorcycles, computers and office equipment of more than \n$50,000  but  less  than  $500,000  will  follow  national  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Items \ncosting less than $50,000 will be procured through shopping. Details of procurement packages \nand technical specifications must be submitted to Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and \nADB for approval before procurement. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n70.  Civil works under the Project will consist of construction and/or rehabilitation of training \nfacilities, workshops, and dormitories. Civil works contracts estimated at $1 million or more will \nbe awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Civil works contracts of more than \n$50,000  but  less  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures, and contracts less than $50,000 may be procured through shopping.  \n \n71.  The procurement capacity assessment reveals that the DGTVET is experienced in the \nprocurement of goods, but less experienced in procuring works and services and consultants, \nand the site management and monitoring of civil works (Supplementary Appendix I). Training \nand mentoring will be provided by the consultants to strengthen capacity, specifically in the \npreparation of bid documents and bid evaluation reports for civil works, bid evaluation, training \nof  PCU  staff,  and  procurement  review  committees  on  procurement  regulations  and  ADB \nguidelines, preparation of detailed lists, and technical specifications of equipment, and selection \nand contracting of consulting services.  \n \n \n ", "  17 \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n72.  The Project will be supported by 600 person-months of consultants (160 person-months \nof international and 440 person-months of national consultants). The consulting services are \ndesigned to assist the Project to achieve sustainable outcomes by providing technical support \nfor implementation, system and institutional monitoring and training planning, management, and \ndelivery and staff upgrading. Ten of the international and nine of the national specialists will \nassist with skills standards and curriculum development, management and instructor training, \ndevelopment of management information systems and a web site, and implementation of the \nVSTP. Two of the international and two national consultants will support the PCU in finance, \nmonitoring and evaluation, procurement and civil works. All consultants will be selected in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Project implementation consultants will be engaged through a firm on the basis of quality- \nand cost-based selection with an 80:20 weighting. MOLVT, through the PCU, will be responsible \nfor selecting and hiring consultants. Additional individual consultants will be hired to support the \nPCU as needed. The Project will also recruit consulting or other firms who will facilitate regional \ntraining and study tours as well as carry out M&E baseline and impact studies using the \nconsultants' qualification selection method. In-country training will also be arranged using the \nconsultants'  qualification  selection  method.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix J.   \n \n  5.  Advance Contracting \n \n73.  The  EA  will  undertake  advance  contracting  of  consultants  to  speed  up  project \nimplementation. DGTVET may start consultant selection, but this will not include the signing of \ncontracts. An individual consultant may be hired to assist in this process. \n \n6.   Anticorruption Policy  \n \n74.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MEF  and  the  MOLVT.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n75.  The Project incorporates several additional measures to deter corruption and increase \ntransparency.  The  Project  will  (i)  build  capacity  within  DGTVET  and  training  institutions  to \nunderstand  and  comply  with  ADB  and  government  procedures  as  outlined  in  the  project \nadministration memorandum; and (ii) widely publicize in training institutions and MOLVT the \nexistence of the integrity division within ADB\u2019s Office of the Auditor General, as the initial point of \ncontact  for  allegations  of  fraud,  corruption,  and  abuse  in  ADB-financed  projects.  A  project \nwebpage will be developed to disclose information about project matters, including procurement. \nThe project good governance framework is provided in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n76.  The financial management capacity assessment (Supplementary Appendix L) identified \nareas where strengthening is required and these have been addressed in the proposed project \nactivities and specialist services, training, and hardware and software equipment inputs. The \n ", "18   \nProject will develop a financial management system, which will embrace training institutions as \nwell  as  MOLVT  and  provincial  offices.  This  will  be  a  component  of  the  Project's  planned \nVETMIS. There will also be a comprehensive training program for Department of Finance and \nState Property, provincial office and TVET institution staff in principles and practice of financial \nmanagement.  MOLVT  financial  management  activities  at  all  levels  will  be  supported  with \nsuitable  equipment  and  software.  With  these  actions,  and  current  reforms  in  financial \nmanagement, the assessment concluded that MOLVT will be able to successfully manage the \nproject.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n77.  A deposit account, under the control of the MEF, will be established at the National Bank \nof  Cambodia.  A  second  generation  imprest  account  under  the  control  of  MOLVT  will  be \nestablished at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account will have an initial \nadvance ceiling of $2 million, or the estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest \naccount for the first 6 months, whichever is lower. This account, and all subsidiary accounts, will \nbe  established,  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The amount to be deposited \ninto the second generation account shall be equivalent to the initial deposit into the imprest \naccount. The statement of expenditure procedure may be used to liquidate or replenish the \nsecond generation imprest account for contracts not exceeding $100,000. Funds for VSTP will \nbe transferred directly from the second generation imprest account to the bank accounts of the \nPTCs, each of which will be authorized to make payments agreed under the VSTP to PTBs, \ncommune councils and approved training providers. As the statement of expenditure procedure \ncannot  be  used  at  the  PTCs  (or  the  provincial  level),  all  supporting  documents,  including \nevidence  of  expenditures,  will  be  retained  by  the  PCU.  The  funds  flow  and  acquittal  and \nfinancial reporting mechanisms are shown in Appendix 11. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting   \n \n78.  Each  project  beneficiary  institution  will  be  required  to  keep  separate  accounts  and \nevidence of expenditures.  Each institution will submit to the PCU quarterly and annual financial \nreports.  The  PCU  will  review  and  retain  supporting  documents,  including  evidence  of \nexpenditures funded from the imprest account which will be maintained by MOLVT. The PCU \nmay from time to time arrange semi-annual audits of accounts and records. In cases where \nfinancial or other irregularities have occurred in relation to project funds, the PCU may suspend \nproject supported activities at the institution involved until the case is resolved to the satisfaction \nof  the  PCU.  Matters  of  funds  recovery  will  be  determined  on  the  advice  of  the  PCU  in \ncollaboration with ADB.   \n \n79.  MOLVT will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify all goods and services \nfinanced from the ADB grant proceeds, and ensure that all accounts and financial statements \nare audited annually by a certified, independent external auditor acceptable to ADB, and in \naccordance with corporate accounting standards in use in Cambodia at the time of each audit.  \nThe auditor will prepare a report on the use of grant funds, compliance with grant covenants, \nuse of the imprest account(s), and statement of expenditure procedures; issue findings of any \nirregularities or discrepancies; and recommend corrective measures so that financial statements \nand audited accounts will be certified by the auditor as meeting generally accepted corporate \naccounting practices in Cambodia. The auditor will provide and describe audit standards and \nkey procedures used in their report.   \n ", "  19 \n80.  MOLVT will submit the audited financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report on the \nproject accounts, including separate opinions on the imprest account and use of the statement \nof expenditure, to ADB in English within 6 months from the end of each fiscal year. The PCU will \nprepare and submit to ADB and DGTVET quarterly reports on the status and progress of project \nimplementation and use of funds within 1 month of the completion of each quarter.  The reports \nwill be in a format acceptable to ADB and indicate progress made against established targets; \nstatus of performance against stated indicators; problems encountered and remedial actions \ntaken; financial- and procurement-related information; compliance with grant covenants; and a \nproposed program of activities for the following quarter.  Within 3 months following the physical \ncompletion of the project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion \nreport in the agreed format.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n81.  A  comprehensive  and  gender-disaggregated  project  management  and  evaluation \nsystem will be designed for the Project.  This will include all levels of TVET reform activity, \nincluding NTB, DGTVET, provincial offices, industry advisory groups, TVET institutions, and the \nProject itself. It will specifically measure the impact, outcome and outputs of proposed TVET \nreform, concurrently evaluating the specific contribution of the Project to the achievement of \nreform goals during Project implementation. In addition to the monitoring of project performance, \nthe proposed system will assist the development of M&E as an integrated, mainstream activity \nof the TVET system itself.    \n \n82.  The comprehensive set of targets and indicators in the design and monitoring framework \nare at the core of project performance monitoring and evaluation.  A comprehensive study will \nbe undertaken during the first year to establish baseline data for all targets and indicators in the \ndesign and monitoring framework. Comprehensive data on the TVET system will be collected, \nincluding enrollments by program and qualification, completion rates, teachers and teacher \nqualifications, and detailed breakdowns of programs offered and qualifications obtained. As part \nof this study, analyses of each of the three priority industry sectors will be carried out, focusing \nparticularly on the profile of the members of each workforce holding TVET qualifications, current \nemployer satisfaction with TVET system graduates, and the expected skill needs in the medium \nterm. These analyses will be required to disaggregate data by gender, where relevant. Data \ngenerated by baseline studies will provide, in part, an information foundation upon which the \nVETMIS and LMIS will be constructed.  Independent midterm and final evaluation studies based \non the design and monitoring framework will also be conducted, covering the industry sector \nanalyses  as  part  of  the  assessment  of  project  results.  The  baseline,  midterm,  and  final \nevaluation studies will be contracted to a firm. Some of the data gathering and analysis relating \nto the industry sectors may be contracted to peak industry bodies. The PCU will be responsible \nfor monitoring and reporting on project implementation progress and performance, assisted by \ninternational and national consultants.  A user manual for Project M&E will be developed.    \n \n10.   Project Review  \n \n83.  The Government and ADB will review the Project\u2019s progress and MOLVT's use of funds, \njointly at least twice a year. They will jointly undertake a midterm review shortly after the PCU\u2019s \nsubmission of the third annual report. The midterm review will focus on overall project strategy \nand achievements, which may require adjustments of targets and processes and reallocation of \nresources.  Specifically,  the  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  project  scope,  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  institutional  development,  and  capacity  building;  (ii)  assess \nproject implementation against projections and performance indicators; (iii) review compliance \n ", "20   \nwith grant covenants; (iv) identify critical issues, problems, and constraints; and (v) recommend \nchanges in project design or implementation. One month before the review, the PCU will submit \nto ADB a comprehensive report on each of these issues. Finally, a project completion report will \nbe prepared to assess early impact and identify lessons learned.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts \n \n1.  Project Economic and Financial Justification \n84.  The direct beneficiaries of the proposed project will be the 267,000 trainees who receive \ntraining under the Project: 2,200 in formal TVET institutions, and, in PTCs, about 54,000 from \nshort courses and 210,000 from nonformal training under the VSTP. Other direct beneficiaries \ninclude (i) teacher trainers and trainee teachers at the NTTI; (ii) instructors and management \nstaff in the existing long-course training institutes, the five upgraded RTCs and two new PTCs \nand other existing PTCs; and (iii) the management and administrative staff of DGTVET and the \nprovincial offices of the Labor and Vocational Training Department.  \n \n85.  The primary beneficiaries will be the rural underemployed, including displaced workers \nfrom  the  garment  industry  and  other  industries  hit  hard  by  the  global  financial  crisis  and \neconomic downturn, who will receive training under the scheme. Most have few skills and are \nearly school leavers with no formal post-school training. The expanded VSTP will reach an \nestimated 210,000 people.  The training they receive will be PTC-, enterprise- and community-\nbased, but it is expected that the majority will receive community-based training.   \n \n86.  The expected benefits VSTP trainees will receive are skills, primarily in aspects of non-\npaddy agriculture that will raise their productive contribution to their communities.  In turn, this is \nexpected  to  (i)  raise  their  earnings  potential,  and  therefore  contribute  to  their  family  and \ncommunity incomes; and (ii) lead to greater diversity in and increased production of non-paddy \nagriculture, which will then raise the sector GDP. By helping to provide greater economic activity \nand  a  better  chance  of  making  an  independent  livelihood  for  this  otherwise  low-skilled, \nunderemployed and low-income section of the population, the country as a whole stands to \nbenefit.   \n \n87.  About 5,000 trainees completed PTC courses (non-VSTP) in 2008, mostly in agriculture-\nrelated programs. It is expected that project interventions will (i) expand that number by an \nestimated 600 a year, through the construction and equipping of two new PTCs; (ii) promote \ngreater  diversity  in  the  training  programs  offered  by  PTCs;  and  (iii)  improve  the  learning \nexperience of those that enroll in them. These quantitative and qualitative improvements are \nexpected to provide PTC trainees with skills that are more relevant to the changing needs of \nlocal informal economies.   \n \n88.  The establishment of the NTTI training complex and the development of the new industry \nstandards and curricula are projected to produce about 300 TVET teacher graduates per year \nafter the re-organized NTTI is fully operational. These graduates will be capable of delivering the \nmid-level  skills  training  of  the  type  and  quality  the  modern  corporate  sector  requires.  The \nupgrading of five PTCs into RTCs will be a major initiative. The expected benefits will be (i) an \nestimated 1,350 new skilled graduates per annum entering the labor market; (ii) greater access to \nthis level of training for school-leavers outside the Phnom Penh region; and (iii) through the \nspecial RTC dormitory provisions, better and safer access for young women in provincial areas.  ", "  21 \n89.  The additional 1,350 graduates entering the labor force each year from the upgraded \nRTCs will almost treble that entering from DGTVET long-course institutes at present.  This will \nput pressure on the relatively small corporate wage sector. However, they will form an important \npool of mid-level skilled workers that employers will be able to draw on as Cambodian economic \ndevelopment and growth picks up.  It is expected that the RTC upgrade initiative will generate \nan economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.2%.  An assessment of training outcomes of the \nVSTP pilot showed that the program generated increases in average family income as high as \n30% 3 months after training was completed, and 98% after 6 months. Taken together with the \n12.5% estimated rate of return on the RTC upgrades, these VSTP impacts demonstrate the \nhigh economic benefits the project will generate.   \n \n90.  The EIRR will be sensitive to changes in economic circumstances, and in particular how \nthese impact upon the labor force experiences of RTC graduates.  The most likely variations \nyielded EIRRs in the range 10%\u201315%, with a strong centering on 12%\u201313% (see the economic \nand financial analysis in Supplementary Appendix M).  \n \n91.  Management and administrative staff of DGTVET will benefit from training and upgraded \nequipment  and  systems  support.  Included  in  project  interventions  are  activities  aimed  at \nstrengthening  their  financial  management  capacity.  The  immediate  effect  will  be  a  better \nunderstanding of the issues and principles that underlie their work, practical and organizational \nskills that will help them perform better, and up-to-date systems, hardware and software. It can \nbe expected that the TVET system as a whole will benefit from the more effective planning and \nmanagement that will result.  In turn, employers and industry will benefit from a TVET subsector \nthat is more responsive to their needs for more and better-trained mid-level skilled workers.   \n \n2.  Financial Impact and Sustainability \n92.  The project requires a total Government contribution of $3.02 million over the 5-year life \nof the project, with the biggest contribution in the form of taxes and charges foregone on \nmachinery, equipment and supplies. Other contributions include the land upon which the two \nnew PTCs are to be built and office space for the PCU. The only contribution that has budgetary \nimplications  for  the  Government  over  the  life  of  the  project  is  an  estimated  $0.35  million \nresulting from the additional staff required at the new PTCs, the RTCs, and at NTTI.  \n \n93.  It  appears  that  the  project  is  financially  sustainable.  The  post-project  incremental \npersonnel expenditure, estimated at about 6% of the 2009 annual budget of $2.52 million, can \nbe absorbed. However, responsibility for some of the 22% incremental increase for operations \non non-VSTP programs will fall to the individual PTCs and polytechnics and institutes (which \nmay be able to meet this requirement from discretionary fee income, unlike PTCs, which do not \ncharge fees).  However, the proposed financial management training throughout the project will \nhelp ensure that PTC budgets improve to enable them to plan for this post-project cost.   \n \n94.  The expansion of VSTP represents the single largest project initiative. If it is to be \nmaintained at the project level after the Project ends, it is estimated that a further increase of \n28% over DGTVET's 2009 budget would be needed by 2015.  However, DGTVET has enjoyed \nan average annual increase of 45% in TVET funding from 2005 to 2009 and continues to be a \nhigh Government priority. There is no evidence that this level of increase will not continue, at \nleast until the end of the project. This would provide more resources than needed to cover all \nVSTP funding and all other post-project funding (an overall increase of 89% is needed).  In any \ncase, as the large expansion of VSTP is partly a response to the current economic downturn, it \nmay not have to continue at the same level after the Project.  \n ", "22   \n95.  To further safeguard sustainability, the Project will help in the development of the new 5- \nyear NTDP, 2011\u20132015, scheduled for development by the end of 2010.  A program-focused \nmedium-term expenditure framework (to reflect the new program budget approach being piloted \nby MEF in DGTVET), will be formulated in conjunction with the new NTDP. The expenditure \nframework,  once  agreed  with  MEF,  will  provide  a  stable  framework  for  medium-term \ngovernment financing to TVET; an approach that will help ensure that the major outputs and \noutcomes from the project will be sustainable in the longer term. \n \n3.  Social Aspects \n96.  Poverty  is  widespread  in  Cambodia.  However,  until  the  current  global  economic \ndownturn, the country was making good progress in reducing poverty. The GDP per capita was \ngrowing at an average annual rate of about 10% until 2007\u20132008, and the poverty rate, as high \nas 45% in the mid-1990s, fell to about 30%. In recent years, these gains have slowed or \nreversed as the country\u2019s key export industries have been badly hit.  Not only has this affected \nGDP,  but  displaced  workers,  mainly  women  from  the  garment  industry,  have  swelled  the \nnumbers of the unemployed and underemployed in rural areas. TVET is seen as a key driver of \nGovernment strategies to provide young early school-leavers, people with few if any skills, the \nunderemployed in rural areas and displaced factory workers with training that will make them \nmore attractive to employers and provide them with the opportunity to earn a living.  Nonformal \nTVET plays a particularly important role in this regard and therefore receives substantial support \nunder the proposed Project. The VSTP will provide greatly expanded access to nonformal \nprograms, while the two new PTCs will be in provinces that are among the least developed and \nhave the highest proportions of ethnic minorities. All other PTCs will have equipment and \nprogram upgrades, along with professional development of instructors, to enable them to deliver \nbetter and more relevant training for the most deprived. Special attention will be given to \ndelivering training programs that are attractive to women.  \n \n97.  The planned development of five RTCs will help to reduce poverty by increasing access \nto long-course programs outside Phnom Penh.  It is expected that improved course offerings in \nrelevant areas, as well as well-equipped dormitories, canteens and kitchen facilities dedicated to \nfemale students, will help attract more women.  The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n4.  Gender Benefits  \n \n98.  Women are under-represented in the formal TVET system.  The Project will address this \nby promoting increased enrollments of women in ICT and business. Career guidance courses in \nschools and training institutions will encourage girls to enter non-traditional training areas. The \ninclusion of women's hostels in the RTCs will also increase the likelihood that women will \nundertake  formal  training.  Nonformal  training  has  provided  many  training  opportunities  to \nwomen. Even though the training was not linked to qualifications, it led to increases in rural \nincomes. Under the pilot VSTP, 60% of trainees were women. One reason was that the training \nwas  short,  community-based,  and  directly  linked  to  daily  productive  activities.  Under  the \nexpanded VSTP, the Project will encourage women to train not only in basic agricultural skills, \nbut also in non-paddy agriculture and service-related skills that will further contribute to their \nlivelihood as self-employed or unpaid family workers. More women will be encouraged to join \nthe  1\u20136  month  PTC-based  courses  and  enterprise-based  training  as  these  can  qualify \ngraduates to continue to more advanced training. Studies will be carried out by the PTCs to \nidentify new courses that are attractive to women and that also provide good jobs, such as \nelectronics and graphic design. The gender and ethnic minorities analysis and action plan ", "  23 \nincludes several measures to promote opportunities for women and women\u2019s empowerment \n(Appendix 13). \n \n5.  Environmental Aspects \n99.  No negative environmental effect is anticipated.  The upgrading of five PTCs to RTCs \nwill  be  carried  out  on  existing  training  center  property,  while  the  two  new  PTCs  will  be \nconstructed on vacant government land that has already been identified and confirmed in \nwriting.   \n \nB.  Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigating Measures \n \n100.  An  important  justification  for  the planned  Project  is  the  need,  in  the  current global \neconomic  situation,  for  Cambodia  to  develop  a  wider,  more  internationally  competitive \nproduction base, including an adequate skills base to take advantage of a recovery.  The \nCambodian government is placing a high priority upon TVET and it is assumed that this will \ncontinue into the medium term. Although there is a risk that a major delay in global recovery \ncould reduce the impact of this strategy in the short term, over the longer term the strategy will \nlift the skills and productivity of Cambodian workers.  By more closely aligning local labor force \nskills with industry requirements, the strategy will allow Cambodian skilled workers to replace \nskilled foreign workers.     \n \n101.  While the latest government plans show that the TVET system will continue to have a \nmajor focus on the provision of nonformal rural-based training, they also propose a concurrent \nfocus on the provision of formal, better quality vocational training in both urban and rural areas \nto create a more highly skilled, internationally competitive workforce. In effect, the Government \nis using the downturn as a catalyst both to achieve productivity improvements in existing key \nindustries and to prepare for a more robust, broader economic base for the country post-\nrecovery.  There appears to be little risk that recovery and economic growth will not result in \nemployment growth in those sectors crucial to the Cambodian economy.  \n \n102.  Another important assumption underpinning the reform agenda is that, with a more \naccessible and industry-relevant TVET system producing more appropriately trained graduates, \nenterprises' trust in the employment-readiness of graduates of the system will grow.  It is also \nassumed that, with more positive employment outcomes from TVET-level skilled training, more \nschool leavers and graduates will seek vocational training. To address the low regard with which \nboth industry and many potential trainees hold publicly-provided TVET, the Project will support \nthe creation of key sector-specific industry advisory groups to ensure industry ownership of the \noutcomes  of  TVET  reforms.  In  addition,  the  planned  establishment  of  a  new  National \nEmployment Agency to facilitate the matching of TVET graduates with skill vacancies and to \nadvocate on behalf of TVET training through career counseling and guidance in secondary \nschools should contribute to a marked improvement in community perceptions of the worth of \nvocational training and the occupations to which it leads.   \n \n103.  The TVET system has failed to keep up with recent changes to the economy, changes in \nthe social demand for technical training, and significantly increased access to formal education \nthat have reduced the demand for skills training. However, the Government is keen to undertake \na comprehensive reform of the system. This will be supported through the Project by major \npolicy and regulatory studies, followed by implementation of their recommendations, including \nthe development of long-awaited industry-endorsed skills standards and an NVQF. \n \n ", "24   \n104.  Current proposals for decentralization and deconcentration may lead to major changes \nin the policy making and governance of TVET during the Project.  To mitigate these risks, the \nProject will (i) inform key stakeholders at the national level through the NTB and at the sub-\nnational level through the PTBs; and (ii) build on lessons learned and existing arrangements for \nimplementing demand-driven community-based skills training through commune councils.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n105.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents.   \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that construction of the new PTCs and RTCs will be \non the sites identified and agreed between MOLVT and ADB.  The Government \nwill ensure that these sites are not changed.  Prior to an award of any civil works \ncontract, the Government will ensure that: (a) legal title to the land on which the \nconstruction will be done is transferred to MOLVT; and (b) no land acquisition or \nresettlement is required at the relevant site. Although the identified and agreed \nsites are currently unoccupied, in the event that land acquisition and resettlement \nis  required  for  any  activities  funded  under  the  Project,  the  Government  will \nensure that land acquisition and resettlement is carried out in accordance with \nADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \n(ii)  The Government will continue to provide support for VSTP after Project support \nis completed in each province.   \n \n(iii)  To ensure that women benefit equally from the Project, the Government and \nMOLVT will ensure that the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998) and will meet the targets outlined in \nthe DMF attached in Appendix 1 and the gender and ethnic minorities analysis \nand action plan attached in Appendix 13. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n106.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the grant not exceeding $24,500,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  for  the  Strengthening  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training \nProject, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nC.

Economic Setting \n   \n1.  Cambodia has reached an important juncture in its economic development.  On the one \nhand, it is in transition from a traditional agrarian base to a more modern industrialized economy \nand, on the other, it is moving from a closed central command economy to one that is market-\nbased and open to a competitive, global environment.  At the same time, it has been caught up \nin a far-reaching economic recession and it possesses little of the financial capacity available to \nwealthier countries with which to protect its population. \n \n2.  Four years of double-digit gross domestic product (GDP) growth (averaging 11% per \nannum during 2004\u20132007) have been successfully translated into a reduction of the population \nliving on or below the poverty line, from about 34% to 30% of the total.  The Government \nrecognizes that much more needs to be done, particularly now that these gains are at risk. With \na small urban middle class and low rates of internal consumption, the external environment will \ncontinue to be the principal determinant of economic development.  \n \n3.  Over 80% of Cambodians still live in rural areas, and about 68% of the labor force still \nfinds employment in agriculture, but its productivity is very low. The estimated contribution to \nGDP of the whole agricultural sector was only 27% in 2007 and there has been little growth in \nreal terms over recent years. There is little commercial, plantation-style agriculture or livestock \nproduction. \n \n4.  The economy is very dependent on three economic sectors: agriculture, services, and \nmanufacturing. Manufacturing is built on a very narrow base, with the garment industry being its \nbackbone, contributing 23% of GDP and accounting for almost 75% of all manufacturing, 90% \nof manufacturing jobs growth, and 70% of all export revenue.  The services sector is the largest \ncontributor to GDP, accounting for almost 42%, and it is also the next most important sector to \nagriculture in terms of employment. While trade and other private services (principally personal \nand business and financial services) lead the services sector, since 2003 employment growth in \nthe sector has been dominated by tourism.  The number of tourist arrivals has fallen only slightly \nduring  the  current  global  crisis,  but  in  the  garment  industry  production  and  exports  have \ndropped dramatically. \n \n5.  With these three sectors, in total, accounting for 85% of employment and 92% of GDP, \nthe Government recognizes that the issue of productivity must be addressed, as must the need \nto attract new industries to increase the diversification of the economy.  It strongly believes \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) has an important role to play in the effort \nto meet these challenges, and it recognizes the need to transform TVET into a quality, demand-\ndriven training system that is relevant to industry.   \n \nB.  General Education and Technical and Vocational Education and Training \n \n6.  Until 2005, formal TVET provision was under the control and academic structures of the \nMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS), as an integral part of a 16-year multi-track \neducation system.  The transfer of its post-grade 9 technical and TVET programs to the newly-\nformed Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT) in 2005 to form a discrete post grade \n9 school vocational training system, has retained the basic pathway from grade 9 in basic \neducation to TVET training under MOLVT, but has removed the former pathways between \nTVET and formal education at senior high school, graduate and postgraduate levels. Further, \nand perhaps more seriously, the retention of the grade 9 entry level as the basis for entry to ", "Appendix 2  31 \nformal TVET programs has made transfer from the nonformal basic skills training, offered \nprimarily in provincial training centers (PTCs), to the formal levels of TVET virtually impossible.  \n \nC.  Technical and Vocational Education and Training Under the Ministry of Labor and \nVocational Training  \n \n7.  In  its  first  National  TVET  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132011  (NTDP),  MOLVT  and  its \nDirectorate-General for TVET (DGTVET) identified poverty alleviation as the continuing principal \nthrust of TVET (as it had been under MOEYS). This focus was, and is still, consistent with the \ngovernment\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan. Accordingly, MOLVT continued to direct a \ngreat deal of its limited resources under the National Training Fund for mostly nonformal, \nlivelihood training in rural areas with high levels of poverty incidence.  In its 2008 update of the \nNTDP, however, a new direction was signaled: \u201c... (while) there will be proposals to add to our \ngrowing strength in community based skills development, (there will also be) ... a new emphasis \non institution based TVET\u201d.1  It was clear MOLVT had identified a need to redress the imbalance \nbetween  nonformal  training  for  basic  skills  and  formal  training  for  qualifications,  with  an \nincreasing emphasis on formal training to meet the needs of the country\u2019s industrializing and \ncorporate service sectors. \n \n8.  In 2009, the TVET system under DGTVET has 36 polytechnics and institutes and 25 \nPTCs and offering programs from basic skills to advanced degrees. \n \n9.  Provincial training centers.  The 25 PTCs offer nonformal basic TVET training. They \noriginated in the centers established under assistance from the United Nations Development \nProgramme  and  the  International  Labour  Organization  in  the  mid-1990s  to  provide  short \nnonformal  training  programs  to  address  the  then  major  problem  of rural  and  urban  social \ndislocation and poverty.  Programs focused on basic agriculture, construction, metal cutting, \nelectronics, motor repair skills, crafts and food processing skills. Subsequently, programs to \nprovide  extended  training  in  3-  to  4-month  programs  in  wider  basic  technical  skills  were \ndeveloped, largely through Asian Development Bank (ADB) project support under the First and \nSecond Education Sector Development Programs (ESDP). Such programs provide a continuing \nlocal  source  of  skills  access  in  predominantly  rural  areas.  Table  A2.1  summarizes  recent \ntraining provision across all PTCs, and is representative of the majority of the training provision. \nNo systematic data on work, employment or earnings outcomes are available. \n \nTable A2.1:  Provincial Training Center Agriculture and Services Programs, 2007\u20132008 \n \n  No. of  Average  Person-\nTraining Program  Trainees  Length  Months \nAgriculture (including vegetable growing, poultry, pigs,  39,579  2 weeks  16,276 \npoultry,  cattle,  fish,  fertilizer,  and  basic  veterinary \nscience)   \nTechnical  Trades  Skills  (including  mechanical,  motor,  1,757  3 months  5,141 \nelectrical,  electronics,  plumbing,  welding,  and \nconstruction) \nTextiles, Garments and Handicrafts  763  4.6 months  3,490 \nHairdressing and Beauty  386  4.4 months  1,670 \nComputing   732  4.1 months  3,001 \nTourism and Hospitality  1,008  2 weeks  327 \nOther (including business, art, design, and languages)   8,911  12 days  4,964 \nTotal  53,136    34,869 \nSource:  Project Preparatory Technical Assistance Survey, March 2009.   \n                                                 \n1  DGTVET for the National Training Board. 2007. The National TVET Development Plan, 2008 Update. Phnom Penh.  \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n10.  There is wide variation in the coverage and quantity of provision between the centers, \nfrom centers offering as few as three programs for 60 students a year, to those offering 20 \nprograms for 9,000 students. While this presumably reflects local demand for training to some \nextent,  it  is  also  clear  that  there  is  considerable  variation  in  the  effectiveness  of  the \nmanagement of the different centers. Currently, there appears to be little established central (or \nprovincial) support for PTC directors in such areas as center management, training procedures \nor professional development. Some centers have established viable links to local employers, \nand these do reflect local employment needs.   \n \n11.  The variation in activity between the PTCs is reflected in a wide variation in the size of \nthe teaching staff, with an average of 20 across all PTCs, but with a range of between 10 and \n38 permanent teachers, and 11 to 46 when contractual teachers are included.  Permanent \nteachers  are  generally  recent  graduates  from  the  Phnom  Penh  formal  technical  training \ninstitutions and since 2000 have been required to complete formal teacher training as well.  \nCurrently, 74% of all permanent PTC teachers have a teacher training qualification in addition to \na minimum bachelor or diploma level technical qualification.  In general contractual teachers \nlack pedagogic training.  \n \n12.  All PTC programs are nonformal, lack formal certification, and carry no credit or link to \nformal training.  Overall, there is little employer input to curricula or to the determination of \ntraining needs, although some PTCs have now begun to develop significant community links \nfollowing their involvement in the recent Voucher Skills Training Programs (VSTP) under the \nADB Second ESDP Project.  Some PTCs have also recently begun to review training provision \nin  response  to  fee-paying  student  demand  for  basic  business  and  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) programs, although no approved central curriculum exists for \nthese programs, or for certification or credit award of programs.  \n \n13.  PTC trainees have generally had at least grade 5 formal education but this has not been \na requirement. Table A2.2 summarizes data from a recent survey of all PTCs, and reflects one \nof the key issues for the ongoing development of a viable, more industry-responsive TVET \nsystem.  Entry into certificated, longer program TVET training (longer than 1 year) currently \nrequires  the  successful  completion  of  grade  9  formal  education,  a  qualification  held  by  a \nminority of PTC trainees. The proportion of such trainees in programs covering the key TVET \ntrade skills areas is relatively high (60%), but in agricultural programs 90% of trainees have not \ncompleted grade 9. The overall proportion of 14% indicates the main obstacle to introducing \nstandard formal courses into most PTCs (see Table A2.2). \n \nTable A2.2:  Provincial Training Center Trainees by Formal Education Level,  \nAcademic Year 2008/2009 \n \n  Agriculture    Trade Short    Total   \nEducation Level of Trainees  Short Courses  %  Courses  %  % \nGrade 9 pass or above   3,530  10  1,947  59  5,477  14 \nGrade 9 fail or below  31,917  90  1,344  41  33,261  86 \nTotal Trainees  2008/ 2009  35,447  100  3,291  100  38,738  100 \nNote:  Data by trainee numbers not adjusted for length of programs.     \nSource:  Survey carried out for project preparatory technical assistance in July 2009. \n \n14.  Voucher Skills Training Program. The pilot VSTP provided financial allocations for \ntraining provision and support for program development, management and delivery, largely \ninvolving PTCs in the pilot areas. Training plans and delivery procedures were developed \nthrough the local commune councils, assisted by a community development specialist from the ", "Appendix 2  33 \nrelevant PTC.  Programs focused on identified areas of local skills needs and employment or \nself-employment. The pilot program covered 201 communes in seven poor provinces, and \n100,000  trainees.  A  major  extension  of  the  VSTP  is  planned  under  the  proposed  Project \nmodified to reflect the lessons learned in the pilot. \n \n15.  Formal  training  institutes. The MOLVT institutes provide longer, formal, internally-\nlinked programs after grade 9 from certificate to master's degree level (Table A2.3). Only 22% of \nstudents are enrolled in certificate-level programs, almost exclusively in technical areas. There \nare no mid-level business/ICT courses. Diploma and degree courses have become the first \npreference of most students, attracting 72% of all students in 2007/08.    \n \n16.  The 10 post-secondary institutions occupy modern facilities in attractive surroundings, \nthe majority in Phnom Penh. The current curricula for certificate, diploma and degree programs \nwere largely developed through donor support over the last decade. Despite relatively recent \nteacher training for most staff through National Technical Training Institute (NTTI), many lack \nup-to-date, practical technical skills, and institute directors identify this as a major problem. As a \nresult, programs at all levels appear to have become increasing academic and unrelated to \nskills performance, despite their original objectives.  \n \nTable A2.3:  Number of Graduates by Subject in MOLVT Formal Training Institutes,  \nAcademic Year 2007/2008 \nPercentage \nSubject   Certificate   Diploma  Bachelor's   Master's  Total \nof Total \nA.

Current staffing provision, qualifications of staff, and teacher training are summarized in \nTable  A2.4.  Across  the  post-secondary  institutes,  there  appears  to  be  a  well-established \ntradition of maintaining links with industry for program support, work experience and graduate \nemployment and, in the past at least, it appears there was high employment placement. Despite \nthis,  there  is  an  increasing  trend  away  from  enrollment  in  the  technical  programs  of  the \ninstitutes,  particularly  in  the  major  Phnom  Penh  institutions,  and  a  growing  move  towards \nbusiness and ICT. Such programs, often fee-paying, have become increasingly common in \nmost institutes. For the most recent academic year, over one-third of all programs were in \n\u201ccomputing, business and other\u201d fields and, more significantly for the future, current business \ngraduates at the bachelor\u2019s degree level equal the total of technical graduates (Table A2.3). \nThis trend does not appear to have occurred in the two institutions outside the capital, in \nKampot and Battambang. \n \nTable A2.4:  Teachers in  Formal Training Institutes,  \nAcademic Year 2008/2009 \n \n  Teachers  Qualifications \nBachelor's  Teacher \nInstitute  Permanent  Contract  Master's  or  Other  Training \nDiploma \nNational Polytechnic Institute of \n42  47  24  49    42 \nCambodia \nNational Institute of Business  34  10  33  5    34 \nNational Technical Training Institute  28    4  26    28 \nPreah Kossomak Polytechnic   45  21  20  61    45 \nPolytechnic Institute of Battambang  30  14  6  24    20 \nBattambang Institute of Technology  34  7  3  16  7  24 \nKampot Polytechnic Institute  38      38  2  32 \nIndustrial Technical Institute  59  0  7  52    45 \nCambodia\u2013India Entrepreneurship \n32  6  13  21    32 \nDevelopment Center \nCambodia\u2013Thai Skills Development \n19  4  4  8    19 \nCenter \nTotal  361  109  114  399  9  321 \nDGTVET = Directorate General of Technical and Vocational Education and Training, MOLVT = Ministry of Labor and \nVocational Training.     \nSource: DGTVET data, May 2009. \n \n18.  Teacher training in technical and vocational education and training.  The current 1-\nyear TVET teacher-training program offered by NTTI was largely developed under the ADB \nBasic Skills Project.2 It follows the then traditional teacher training model of formal lectures in \npsychology, curriculum development, pedagogy, philosophy of education and teaching materials \n(including practical development), plus formal practical training with at least one teaching class \nper week over eight weeks. No skills upgrading for specific skills teaching is included, although \nmost teachers lack practical skills. Recently, components in community and entrepreneurship \ndevelopment have been added. Postings of newly trained teachers are made by DGTVET. \n \n19.  The proposed Project will support the development of a more experiential program \ndirectly focused on the practical training responsibilities of TVET teachers, and will include direct \nskills enhancement in the specialist teaching areas.  It will include training for the community \ndevelopment activities of PTC instructors, and basic entrepreneurship training.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1995.

The major NGO provider of technical skills \ntraining is Don Bosco, which has operated technical schools and training centers in Cambodia \nsince  1991.    In  academic  year  2008/2009,  it  offers  2-year  programs  with  526  trainees  in \nwelding, mechanical, electricity, auto mechanics, and electronics (electronics is open to both \ngirls and boys).  Printing was formerly offered but has now been suspended because of the lack \nof jobs.  Programs are open to those who have undertaken grade 9 secondary education, \nalthough a successful exam pass is not required. Training is closely directed to employment, \nwith work placements and assistance with job search on completion. \n \n21.  Other non-institutional NGO provision varies widely depending on donor finance, and \nconcentrates  on  nonformal  agricultural  provision,  crafts,  textiles  and  garments.  The  limited \navailable registration data indicates that about 30\u201350 organizations are involved in training for \nabout 300\u2013500 people per year in 1-week to 1-month programs.  \n \n22.  Private provision. A 2009 survey of private providers estimated that about 750 private \nbusiness concerns are offering fee-for-training services in Cambodia, of which 46% (345) were \nlocated in Phnom Penh.  The majority (60%) offered computer training and/or English, or were \nprivate driving schools or dancing academies. A further 30% were small businesses (e.g., auto \nrepair and electrical maintenance), which offered informal apprenticeships through a pay-and- \nwork arrangement. The remaining 135 enterprises indicated that they trained in auto repair, \npainting and electrical, with a wide variation in fees charged and training arrangements. The \ntotal training capacity in the basic trade areas was a minimum of between 700 and 800 trainees \nper year for 6 to 12 months. Training center proprietors reported that most trainees obtained \nemployment, and were assisted in doing so. No assessment of the training quality could be \nmade. \n \n23.  Formal  apprenticeships.  All private enterprises employing 60 or more workers are \nobliged by law to take on an additional 10% of their workforce as apprentices. MOLVT reports that \nin 2008 there were about 100 registrations in technical trades and 6,200 in textiles/garments and \ntourism. No data on graduates are available.  \n \nE.  Major Issues \n \n24.  System capacity.  Total current TVET capacity is limited. The estimated total formal \ntraining output in 2008 was about 2,500 in formal programs. Nonformal output is difficult to \nquantify because of the wide variation in program type and length but is probably about 8,000 in \nall program types, irrespective of length. Importantly, in 2008, the MOLVT institutes graduated \nfewer than 1,100 trainees with formal, vocational level qualifications at certificate and diploma \nlevels. Correspondingly, only about 5,000 undertook PTC programs longer than 1\u20132 weeks. \nBefore  the  current  economic  downturn,  the  main  employer  organizations  pointed  to  the \nexistence of skill shortages side by side with significant numbers of unemployed and under-\nemployed unskilled adolescents and adults living on or below the poverty line.  The result is that \nskilled jobs are often filled by relatively expensive imported labor, thus increasing the cost of \nproduction or, conversely, by unskilled or semi-skilled labor that requires significant on-the-job \ntraining,  something  that  small  and  medium-sized  employers  are  usually  not  adequately \nequipped to provide. Either way, the consequence is low productivity, often coupled with poor \nproduct quality. \n \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \n25.  Access and equity. Access to skills training is currently limited to the major urban \nareas, or to nonformal training in the PTCs. The Project will support the extension of training \nprovided by PTCs to the remaining non-served provinces, and the upgrading of such training. It \nwill also support the development of regional training centers to enable the efficient provision of \nwider access to advanced training, and as centers for TVET teacher upgrading. \n \n26.  Quality and relevance.  The quality of teaching in most institutes and PTCs needs \nsubstantial improvement. Almost all TVET instructors lack industrial experience and there is a \nshortage of modern teaching resources.  Curricula across the system are not linked to relevant \nindustry practice and standards, and assessment lacks reliability and validity.  Moreover, most \ninstitutions  lack  adequate,  industry-relevant  equipment  and  training  facilities,  so  theory  is \nemphasized at the expense of practice, thereby ensuring that measurement of competency \nattainment, a cornerstone of modern TVET, is pointless. \n \n27.  The Project will address these challenges through (i) development of new standards- \nbased curriculum and training materials; (ii) a new teacher training curriculum; (iii) a system- \nwide teacher upgrading; (iv) provision of new facilities and equipment to meet the requirements \nof the new training curriculum; (v) the introduction of industry advisory committees to support \nand  assist  standards,  curriculum,  and  assessment  development;  and  (vi)  institutional \nmanagement development and support for the development of the capacity of DGTVET to \ncoordinate and manage the reform agenda. \n ", "                                                                                Appendix 3  37           \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nProject Name  Value and Years  Focus of Assistance \nILO Employment  $18 million  Promoted and provided direct employment skills for rural \nGeneration Program  Phase 1   and  urban  poor  (including  returnees,  displaced  persons, \nVocational Training for  (1992\u20131997)  demobilized  soldiers,  disabled  and  female  heads  of \nEmployment  Phase 2   households) through short vocational training programs for \nGeneration (VTEG)  (1997\u20131998)  identified  employment  opportunities.

The current system of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) reflects \nthe major directions of external assistance to the subsector since the early 1980s following the \nend of the Khmer Rouge period. Initially assistance from the former Soviet Union, Viet Nam and \ncountries in Eastern Europe resulted in large formal institutions for the training of skilled labor and \ntechnicians for specific, more-or-less guaranteed employment in state enterprises. By the mid- \n1990s, state-guaranteed employment of TVET graduates had ceased, program offerings in the \nformal institutions had few links to the needs of the newly emerging labor market, and enrollments \nin such institutions began to decline. At much the same time, the compounding effects of the long \nperiods  of  social  and  economic  dislocation,  and  lack  of  earning  skills  of  returnees,  the \ndemobilized, disabled and displaced, and the abnormal proportions of households headed by \nwomen, had resulted in a cycle of increasing poverty, both rural and urban. Short vocational \ntraining  programs  for  poverty  alleviation  and  income  supplementation  activities  became  a \nsignificant part of donor and nongovernment organization responses.  \n \n2.  While such short-term responses have continued, the ongoing series of projects largely \nassisted by the Asian Development Bank have also focused on the development of systems for \ngovernance,  institutional  development  and  professional  development  of  TVET,  and  the \nrevitalization of the TVET formal training sector, and in the longer term, skills, and advanced \nskills training. However, these reforms have not regained major public support for TVET, either \nin absolute terms or compared with the demand for university entry. The reforms do not appear \nto have been able to renew and maintain the key systemic links to enterprise essential for \neffective TVET planning, program redevelopment and provision, and the employment of its \ngraduates.  \n \n3.  The proposed Project will attempt to redirect the professional and operational focus and \nprocesses of TVET and its institutions to the labor market and the identified skills needs of \nenterprises. It will continue assistance for short training programs for poverty alleviation but will \nattempt  to  ensure  that  an  increasing  proportion  of  all  training  has  links  to  defined  skills \nstandards and labor market needs, and carries recognition for entry and access to further levels \nof accepted market-linked skills training. ", "                                                                                Appendix 4  39           \nESTABLISHING AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT \n \n1.  The Project will develop an integrated learning services system for the upgrading of \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) teacher training, skills standards, testing \nand  assessment;  curriculum  and  training  materials;  and  institutional  management  and \nupgrading. \n \nA.  Organization of Professional Support Services   \n2.  It is proposed that the major support activities for TVET will be channeled through a \ncoordinated  complex  of  senior  TVET  institutions  in  Phnom  Penh  based  on  the  National \nTechnical  Training  Institute  (NTTI),  which  is  responsible  for  TVET  teacher  training  and \ndevelopment. Initially four institutions will be designated as national centers of competence \n(NCC):  (i) Industrial Technical Institute (ITI); (ii) Preah Kossomak Polytechnic Institute (PPI);  \n(iii)  National  Institute  of  Business  (NIB);  and  (iv)  the  Cambodia-India  Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment Centre (CIEDC).   \n  \n3.  Three  of  the  four  NCCs  will  provide  specialist  system  development  support  in  a \nparticular technology: (i) ITI in mechanics; (ii) PPI in construction; and (iii) NIB in business and \ninformation technology. The CIEDC will provide expert services for professional support and \ndevelopment for entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises across each of the \nthree technology areas.  NTTI will be responsible for TVET teacher training and upgrading, and \nwill exercise overall coordination of the professional support services for the TVET system as a \nwhole under DGTVET.  \n \nB.  Proposed Professional Service Activities \n \n4.  Skills standards and curriculum.  In addition to its regular teaching role, each of the \nthree technology institutions will (i) bring together an industry advisory group; (ii) translate \nexisting international competency standards to Khmer for endorsement by the industry advisory \ngroup  and,  following  endorsement;  (iii)  send  the  endorsed  standards  to  the  director  of \nstandards,  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Vocational  Training  for  posting  on  the  NTB  website;  \n(iv) develop curricula and learning materials that meet these standards; (v) support the training \nof assessors from industry to ensure graduates meet the agreed standards; (vi) provide skills \nstrengthening to NTTI students preparing to teach in the new curriculum in each target skill \narea; (vii) partner with NTTI on in-service training for current teachers in the technical areas for \nteaching against the new standards; and (viii) monitor the provision of training as required \nthrough visits to the PTCs and other institutions ensuring the use of the new curriculum.  \n \n5.  Appropriate skills standards are available from countries such as Sri Lanka and the \nPhilippines. These can be adapted for submission to the industry advisory groups for validation.  \n \n6.  Teacher training and upgrading through NTTI.  It is proposed that a new 1-year \npreservice  teacher  training  program  (and  qualification)  be  developed  to  meet  the  specific \nfunctional  needs  of  TVET  trainers  and  community  development  specialists  who  will  be \nemployed for the provincial training centers (PTCs) and regional training centers (RTCs).  \n \n7.  The proposed program will comprise:  (i) pedagogy\u2014directly under NTTI (240 hours);  \n(ii) skills upgrading\u2014by specialization in the appropriate NCC with a specific focus on the \ncurrent  technical  skills-standards-based  curriculum  (240  hours);  and  (iii)  community \ndevelopment, enterprise development, marketing and micro enterprise support\u2014through CIEDC \n ", "40  Appendix 4 \n(240  hours).  The  program  will  also  include  supervised  teaching  experience in  the  specific \nspecialization of each trainee.   \n \n8.  The Project will support the development of programs for specialist training and work-\nplace  implementation  support  for  institutional  managers,  TVET  trainers,  community \ndevelopment specialists and finance officers.  It will support professional services development \nwith  specialist  fellowship  training,  consulting  services,  equipment  and  development  and \noperational costs on the basis of performance-based milestones. \n \n9.  Teaching equipment for their specific target technologies will be provided to the NCCs. \nThe three target technologies will be models for the development and implementation of other \nskills-standards-based  training  that  can  be  adapted  by  other  sectors  in  future.  Project \nassistance will also be provided for the establishment of a central NTTI complex office and \nsupport unit. \n  \nC.  Delivery of Teacher Training Through Regional Training Centers  \n \n10.  The five RTCs will have two major functions: (i) increasing access to technician level \n(grade 9 or equivalent plus 2 years) skills training, and (ii) providing facilities and support for the \ncontinuing in-service upgrading of existing TVET managers, trainers and staff by NTTI complex \nstaff. The Project will provide each RTC with new workshops and laboratories in the three target \ntechnologies, new classroom space, equipment to meet the requirements of the new skills- \nstandards-based curriculum in the three target technologies, and a female hostel for female \nPTC graduates and staff under the new professional support programs. \n \n11.  It is anticipated that the RTCs in Battambang, Kampot and Svay Rieng will begin training \nlate in year 3 of the Project, while Takeo and Siem Reap will begin training late in year 4.  \n ", "                                                                                Appendix 5  41           \nFINANCING AND IMPLEMENTING THE VOUCHER SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAM \n \n1.   The Voucher Skills Training Program (VSTP) will be expanded to all 24 provinces under \nthe Project. The revised procedures outlined below for this second phase reflect the lessons \nlearned  in  the  pilot  phase,  and  the  findings  of  a  survey  of  about  4,000  of  the  140,000 \nparticipants in the pilot program, plus provincial training centers (PTC) directors. \n \n2.  Adjustments have been made to reduce the cost of the program and to increase the \nnumber of trainees in the enterprise-based component (informal apprenticeship). An alternative \nmicroenterprise model has been introduced. Strategies have been developed to link training to \nappropriate entry-level standards in the new enterprise-endorsed curricula under the Project. A \nnew urban-based model has been initiated. Clear guidelines on the allocation of training by \ndelivery format using cost-per-training hour are provided to accelerate the expansion of VSTP in \ncredit-earning technical skills.  \n \nA.  Rural Areas and Micro-Enterprise Provision \n \n1.  Extending the Program to All Provinces \n \n3.  Commune selection criteria.  In line with its objective of poverty alleviation through \ncommunity-based skills training, the pilot VSTP selected the 40% poorest communes in the \nseven poorest provinces, as determined by the United Nations World Food Program, Commune \nBased Poverty Index, 2001. Selected communes were submitted to the Asian Development \nBank for approval.  \n \n4.  The expanded VSTP will include all provinces, and an estimated 210,000 of the poorest \nrural villagers will benefit directly from the program. No communes that formerly received VSTP \nmay be included in the revised program. Communes will be selected based on data on the \npoorest  communes  as  identified  in  the  commune  data  information  system  of  the  National \nInstitute of Statistics (2007 data).1 \n \n5.  Costing. Each province will receive $5,786 per commune for each of the 2 years in the \nVSTP  cycle.  Altogether  530  communes  will  receive  support.  Counting  the  original  210 \ncommunes that received support under the pilot program, a total of 740 out of 1,621 communes \nacross the country will have received support by the end of the Project. The allocation of $5,786 \nper  commune  was  determined  by  an  analysis  of  the  costs  of  the  pilot  program  and  the \neffectiveness of training modalities employed under it. Community development specialists from \nthe PTCs will help commune councils to conform to the requirements of the program. \n \n6.  Schedule.  The schedule ensures that all PTCs will complete 2 years of VSTP during \nthe Project. It provides for the continuation of the program in the seven pilot VSTP PTCs. \nImplementation in the two new PTCs is scheduled for late in the project.  The target group for \nenterprise- and center-based training will be out-of-school youth between the ages of 15 and 24, \nat least half of whom will be female. There needs to be some flexibility in these targets. Usually, \nin the first round of training, agriculture is the priority because it affects virtually all of the \nvillagers.  \n \n7.  Operational procedures. In the first year of training, no more that 60% of the total \ntraining hours will be allocated to community-based training, 20% to enterprise-based informal \n                                                 \n1 National Institute of Statistics. 2007. Commune Development Information System. Phnom Penh. \n ", "42  Appendix 5 \napprenticeships,  and  the  final  20%  to  center-based  training  (either  in  the  PTC  or  another \ntraining center). In the second year, community-based training will be limited to 40% of the \navailable hours with 30% allocated to each of the other categories. \n \n8.  A  community  development  specialist  will  prepare  a  listing  of  all  approved  training \navailable and the cost per training unit as well as an overview of local labor market opportunities \nand  of  microfinance  availability.  Villages  and  communes  will  be  invited  to  add  their  own \nresources to the value of the voucher to enhance the training provided. Operational procedures \nwill be further elaborated in the project administration memorandum. \n \n2.   Microenterprise Voucher Skills Training Program Provision \n \n9.  The Economic Institute of Cambodia estimates that 85% of the workforce was in the \nnonformal economy in 2003. Of these, about half worked in agriculture and about half in rural \nand urban services and other activities. There are two important implications of this (i) most \ngraduates of the skills training will work in the informal economy and thus need training in \nmicroenterprise operations; and (ii) currently most small enterprise workers, street vendors, \nbasic technical service providers, and microenterprise proprietors have little or no access to \nbasic training in finance, microcredit, entrepreneurship, or management.  \n \n10.  Proposed training.  Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) often have direct links to the \nnonformal economy in ways that government would find difficult to copy. Usually, some sense of \nmission is associated with these smaller organizations and their links to local communities and \nmicroenterprises. VSTP will expand the competence of selected NGOs to deliver a range of \nmicroenterprise skills in urban areas to increase family income. The Project will support the \nCambodia-India  Entrepreneurship  Development  Center  to  develop,  manage  and  supervise \nprograms to upgrade the skills of NGOs to deliver specific training targeted at the needs of \nmicroenterprises.  \n \n11.  The training will aim to develop the microbusiness skills of existing informal economy \nmicroenterprise  proprietors  to  increase  income.    Initially,  programs  will  be  confined  to \nenterprises in Phnom Penh:  10 in each of 10 selected communes. NGOs will be invited to apply \nfor a training grant. The NGOs will also coordinate related applications for microcredit under the \nexisting Self Employment Generation Fund.  \n \nTable A5.1:   Rural Voucher Skills Training Program and Microenterprise Funding \n \nAllowance per \nTotal Cost of \nNumber of Provinces  Years of VSTP   Commune/Trainee \nVSTP ($) \nper Year ($) \nRural (23)  2  5,786    6,133,160 \nPhnom Penh, CIEDC  2  278    111,,200  \nTotal        6,238,016 \n  CIEDC = Cambodia-India Entrepreneurship Development Center, VSTP = Voucher Skills Training \n  Program. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Urban Areas \n \n12.  A pilot urban VSTP will be provided in Phnom Penh in mechanics managed through the \nJapan Vocational Center and Work Shop (JVC). This will target automotive, auto machine shop, ", "                                                                                Appendix 5  43           \nmotor, small engines, diesel training, and placement jobs. Up to 400 young people will be \ntrained in informal apprenticeships or training courses contracted from TVET providers who \nhave agreed to use the new enterprise skills standards in mechanics that will be developed \nunder the Project. At least 10 trainees should be young women. The new mechanism will lead \nto entry-level skills for which credit may be earned in the future for further and higher levels of \ntraining.  The urban pilot will initially apply only in Phnom Penh, but it may be expanded to other \nurban settings or to other technologies. The urban pilot will begin in year 3 to ensure that the \nMinistry of Labor and Vocational Training supervises it and that the new skills standards are in \nplace.  \n \n13.  Advertisements will be placed to call for expressions of interest to provide training based \non the new standards and curriculum. Training providers that respond will be required to register \nwith the National TVET Trainers Network. Informal apprenticeship will be the preferred mode of \ndelivery, but classroom or on-the-job training will also be eligible. Selected providers will receive \na 20% mobilization allowance, 30% payment at the midpoint of training based on numbers of \ncontinuing students, and the remaining 50% on completion of training. A maximum allocation of \n20 trainees per provider will ensure a wide range of providers for the pilot. JVC may take up to \n20 trainees itself. \n \n14.  The costing is based the VSTP pilot of $0.29 per trainee hour for a 6-month technical \nskills program, with a cost per trainee of $278, made up of $218 for completing the training \ncourse and a $60 supplementary payment to the trainer for graduates who are fully employed 3 \nmonths after graduation. The target will be 200 trainees each year for 2 years. JVC will receive \n10% of each training contract as a management fee on the completion of training plus 5% for \nmonitoring of training, based on submission of quarterly reports. The total fee per student \npayable to the training provider will be of $236.    \n \n15.  The total financial provision for the urban VSTP program is summarized in Table A5.2. \nStandard VSTP mechanisms will apply, and the VSTP consultants will support implementation.  \n \nTable A5.2:  Pilot Urban Voucher Skills Training Program Funding \n \nNumber of  Cost per  Number of  Cost per Year   Total Cost of \nTrainees per Year  Trainee ($)  Years  ($)  Urban VSTP ($) \n200  278  2  55,600  111,200 \nVSTP = Voucher Skills Training Program. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 6 \nDEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SKILLS STANDARDS \n \n1.  The first stage in improving quality of delivery includes (i) developing and implementing a \nsystem of national skills standards, (ii) training of trainers to use the standards, (iii) ensuring the \nteaching equipment is available to meet the standards. The second stage is to strengthen the \nmanagement capacity of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions so \nthey meet the required standards.  \n \n2.  The National Training Board Policy 11 (2008) requires a quality control program for all \nTVET providers based on skills standards implementation. At present, TVET quality is uncertain \nand neither a national qualifications framework nor national competency standards are used. \nThe Accreditation Council of Cambodia covers higher education but there is no council for \nTVET.  The  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sports  and  some  municipal  offices  register \nproviders but this is not related to quality assurance. The National Training Board (NTB) will \nnow take responsibility for registering and maintaining a quality assurance system for all TVET \nproviders.  \n \nA.  Development, Validation, and Adaptation of Standards \n \n3.  Skills standards will be developed and applied through the Project in three industry \nsectors (mechanics, construction, and business services and information and communication \ntechnologies)  through  the  three  nominated  national  centers  of  competence  (NCC).  The \nstandards will act as models for other skills-standards-based training in other sectors. The three \ninstitutions will receive project support for the development of the standards and production of \ntraining materials.  \n  \n4.  In addition to its regular teaching role, each NCC will (i)  bring together an industry \nadvisory group in its assigned industry sector; (ii) translate international competency standards \nto Khmer, adapt them, and seek endorsement of the industry advisory groups; (iii) send the \nendorsed standard to the director of standards at MOLVT for posting on the NTB website; (iv) \nassist in the development of curricula and learning materials to support the standards; (v) \nsupport the training of assessors from industry to ensure graduates meet the agreed standards; \n(vi)  provide  skills  strengthening  to  National  Technical  Training  Institute  (NTTI)  students \npreparing to teach in the new curriculum in those subject areas; (vii) partner with NTTI on in-\nservice training for current teachers in the technical area; and (viii) monitor the provision of \ntraining as required through visits to the provincial training centers (PTCs) and other institutions \nto ensure the new curriculum is being used. \n  \n5.  Existing skills standards are available from Sri Lanka, and these can be adapted quickly \nand validated by the industry advisory groups. \n \n6.  The implementation model supports the development and adaptation of skills standards \nand curricula up to the technician level. It does not require new standards to be developed but \nrather the validation of existing skills standards from other countries in the region which have \nrecently  completed  the  work.  These  standards  will  be  adapted  to  the  agreed  format  and \nadjusted to meet enterprise requirements for validation.  \n \nB.  Upgrading of Teachers to Implement Standards-Based Training  \n \n7.  The  implementation  model  ensures  that  teachers  are  taught  how  to  deliver  the \ncurriculum. The demand in the PTCs is for basic hands-on skills training and this is not currently \nsupported  by  the  largely  theoretical  skills  of  the  graduates  of  the  national  TVET  trainers ", "                                                                                Appendix 6  45           \nprogram. This 1-year postgraduate program offered at NTTI will be revised so it has three \ndistinct  components:  (i)  pedagogy  in  TVET  and  for  adults;  (ii)  microenterprise,  community \ndevelopment, enterprise-based informal apprenticeship, and job matching career advice; and  \n(iii) technical hands-on skills improvement.  Each component will be delivered by specialists in \nthe NCCs, who will have been upgraded with fellowships provided by the grant.  \n \n8.  The  three  institutions  designated  as  NCCs  will  provide  hands-on  training  in  their \nspeciality areas. NTTI will provide a revised pedagogy curriculum with much more emphasis on \nskills that will make students more employable and on-the-job training. The Cambodia-India \nEntrepreneurship  Development  Center  (CIEDC),  a  specialist  small  business  development \nfacility within the NTTI campus, will provide training for area (ii) in paragraph 7. The NCCs will \nprovide technical skills improvement.  A revised curriculum is being developed. \n \n9.  NTTI has a mandate to train TVET teachers and it graduates 300 trainees a year. \nGraduates have completed 10 months of pedagogy and teaching experience after graduating at \nthe diploma or degree level in engineering or business, usually from a Directorate General of \nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (DGTVET) institution. The graduates of the \nNTTI program who are assigned to the PTCs and other TVET institutions have few hands-on \nskills, although 95% of the training done by these institutions is basic entry-level skills. Some \nNTTI graduates are assigned to PTCs as community development specialists. Their job is to  \n(i) help commune members develop microenterprises and access microfinance, (ii) provide job \nmatching and career guidance, (iii) provide community training needs analysis in support of \nvoucher skills training program (VSTP), and (iv) develop small enterprise links for informal \napprenticeship in support of VSTP. They receive no training for these tasks.  \n \n10.  The new TVET trainer programs will be coordinated by NTTI, which will also provide 240 \nhours of pedagogy and adult learning techniques. Teacher trainees will also receive 240 hours \nof hands-on skills or applied training in their specialties: mechanics, construction and business \nand information and communication technology in the specialist NCCs. Trainees will then spend \n240 hours with CIEDC to prepare for the service activities provided by the TVET institutions. As \n90% of opportunities for graduates will be in self-employment or family-based employment, \nmicroenterprise management will be integrated into most skills training.  \n \n11.  For the 400 NTTI graduates currently working in institutions, an in-service program is \nrequired. The five regional centers will form the network in which NTTI campus trainers will \nprovide annual in-service to all trainers and community development specialists. \n \n12.  In preparation for the development of skills standards in the three industry sectors, the \nProject will upgrade the senior teaching staff in the NTTI and NCC institutions through regional \nfellowships and support from consultants in standards and technical curricula and TVET trainer \ntraining  design.  Training  within  Asia  will  be  provided  for  two  lead  teachers  in  technical \nupgrading,  skills  standards  development,  TVET  curriculum  benchmarking  and  training \norganization and methodology. Two NTTI trainers will undertake similar programs, including \nwork experience, in order to develop skills standards and curricula. Two other NTTI teacher \ntrainers will undertake programs in pedagogy, work placement, and career guidance. One \nsenior  officer  of  DGTVET  will  undertake  regional  training  in  enterprise  relations,  social \nmarketing, and TVET partnerships.  \n \n ", "46  Appendix 7 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n Table A7.1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nCambodia's socioeconomic planning framework is the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Phase II, launched in September 2008. \nIts strategies include improvement of productivity and diversification of agriculture, private sector development, employment \ngeneration, and human resource development. The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006\u20132010, based on the \nRectangular Strategy, reiterates the importance of capacity building and human resource development, particularly (i) promotion \nof vocational and skills training, (ii) creation of jobs in both formal and informal sectors; (iii) increase in agricultural productivity to \nincrease rural employment; and (iv) establishment of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and training \nnetworks to assist  both men and women, especially the poor, disabled and vulnerable, to respond to labor market needs. The \nNSDP is carried out through detailed plans from each ministry. The strategic plan of the Ministry of Labor and Vocational \nTraining, 2006-2010 identifies strategies designed to develop the economy and reduce poverty, including development of \ntechnical and vocational skills. The Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT) Plan aims to: (i) establish TVET links \nwith  enterprises;  (ii)  establish  mechanisms  for  labor  market  information;  (iii)  service  both  formal  and  informal  sectors; \n(iv) upgrade TVET through a national vocational qualifications framework (NVQF), competency standards and testing, training \nof trainers, and accreditation of TVET programs and institutions; (v) modernize training facilities and equipment; (vi) strengthen \nlocal planning for local training needs; (vii) establish new centers in unserved provinces; (viii) expand TVET provision through \nthe National Training Fund to reduce poverty more widely; (ix) encourage certificate-based TVET programs in all provinces and \nmunicipalities; and (x) encourage TVET institutions to generate their own income. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nPoverty in Cambodia is characterized by low income and consumption; poor nutritional status; low educational attainment; poor \naccess to public services, including school and health services; poor access to economic opportunities; and vulnerability to \nexternal shocks.  Poor access to quality education has led to a low adult literacy rate of 69.4% (80.5% for males and 58.2% for \nfemales).  The highest poverty rates are found among farmers and those households whose heads have little or no formal \neducation. The poorest households are asset-less. Agricultural productivity is extremely low and food insecurity is still a serious \nproblem for people who are poor. Agriculture remains the backbone of the Cambodian economy, with 68% of the labor force \nearning their livelihood from agriculture. Cambodian women play an active role in the country\u2019s economy and civil society. They \nrepresent 53% of the active labor force, compared with 32% for economically active men, and are usually classified as \u201cunpaid \nfamily labor,\u201d primarily in agriculture.  Apart from agriculture, women work in the informal sector, particular commercial activities. \nThe garment industry provides the principal source of formal sector employment for women, but young women are employed \nthere only as semi-skilled workers with almost no opportunities to move into supervisory or management positions. Women \noutnumber men in the labor force from age 15 to 54, with the exception of the 25 to 29 age group. The shortage of skilled labor \nand the lack of adequate investment in formal vocational skill formation represent key development constraints for Cambodia \nand have been a persistent theme in recent assessments by the ADB and the World Bank.  \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nThe Project proposes a number of interventions to assist in addressing poverty issues.  First, it will help to strengthen the \ninformal TVET sector through the creation of two new provincial training centers (PTCs) in provinces that are among the poorest \nand least developed and have height proportions of ethnic minorities.  All other PTCs will have equipment and program \nupgrades, along with professional development of their teachers, to enable them to deliver better quality, more relevant training \nfor the most deprived.  Special attention will be given to the delivery of training programs attractive to women.  Under the \nVocational Skills Training Program (VSTP), 60% of those trained have been women.  The VSTP will be expanded to all 24 \nprovinces.  It is anticipated that the majority of these trainees will be women.  The training they receive will provide them with \nmostly non-paddy agriculture and service-related skills that will contribute to their livelihood as self-employed or unpaid family \nworkers.  The other major initiative that will help alleviate poverty in regional areas is the planned upgrade of five PTCs to \nregional training centers (RTCs).  This will increase access to long-course programs in areas of the country outside Phnom \nPenh.  When fully operational, these centers will be able to enroll an additional 1,500 students per year at these two vital levels \nof training.  It is expected that improved course offerings in relevant areas, as well as well-equipped dormitories, canteens and \nkitchen facilities dedicated to female students, will help attract more women into this stream of post-school education and \ntraining.  \n ", "Appendix 12  59 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThere is a direct link between a lack of education and poverty. Poverty rates are similar for the household head with no \nschooling and one with primary schooling only, but are significantly lower when the household head has secondary, technical, \nor higher education.  Many adults have no education at all, and there are wide rural\u2013urban and gender disparities in access to \neducation. Nearly 60% of women and 40% of men in the provinces of Mondolkiri and Rattanakiri have no education, compared \nwith fewer than 15% of women and 5% of men in Phnom Penh. In the province of Svay Rieng, girls are almost three times less \nlikely to attend school than boys. This reflects wide gender and rural\u2013urban disparities in access to education in Cambodia.  In \n2007, fully 61% of the literate population in Cambodia 25 years of age and over had not completed primary school, while only \n23% had completed primary level. Those who had completed lower secondary level of education comprised only 9% of the age \ncohort, while those who had a secondary level qualification constituted 3%. Fewer than 1% had qualifications higher than \nsecondary level.  Through its strengthening of the nonformal TVET system, the project will assist those with lower qualifications. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation.  \n \nProject preparation involved two stakeholder workshops with over 100 participants, two surveys of TVET graduates, a \nquestionnaire survey and interviews with seven provincial training center directors and 30 community development specialists \non recommended adjustments to VSTP, interviews with the teachers, managers and graduates of the seven Phnom Penh post-\nsecondary institutes; and a survey of the graduates of the national Technical Training Institute (NTTI) on the effectiveness of \nNTTI teacher training. A sample of 40 private sector TVET trainers was identified and interviewed about non-government \nprovision. \nThe project team also consulted stakeholders, including Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Cambodian Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry, Cambodian Federation of Employers and Business Associations, Cambodian Institute of Development \nStudies, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chamber of Professional and Micro Enterprises, the Federation of Employers, \nGarment Association in Cambodia, Garment Industry Productivity Centre and the Travel and Hospitality Institute. The Ministry of \nWomen's Affairs was also consulted. Donor agencies consulted were European Commission, International Labour Organization \nand the World Bank.  \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowermenti \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \n \nSeveral characteristics of the labor market and the education system are directly relevant to addressing issues related to \npoverty among women in Cambodia.  First, a large proportion of female employment is in the informal sector \u2013 only 17% of \neconomically active women are employed in the formal sector (versus 23% of men).  Informal employment is largely in the \nagricultural sector.  Second, occupational groups within the formal labor market in Cambodia are highly stratified by gender, \nwith men dominating higher level occupations (including technicians).  Even where there is gender parity in occupational \ngroups, there is considerable industry stratification.  For example, although there is gender parity among plant and machine \noperators, women are employed primarily in the garment industry and men in the transport sector.   Men, more so than women, \nare moving into a wider range of better-paid positions outside agriculture. For women, the options are largely limited to the \ngarment industry or the informal sector. There are signs that women are beginning to enter formal employment at a faster rate \nthan men, due mainly to growth in the garment sector and because more women are becoming paid labor in the agriculture \nsector.  Third, the education enrollment gap between boys and girls increases markedly as they progress to higher levels of \neducation.  While almost equal numbers of boys and girls are enrolled in preschool and primary school, only 63 girls are \nenrolled for every 100 boys in lower secondary school and fewer than 50 girls are enrolled for every 100 boys at the upper and \ntertiary education levels.    \n \n2.  Key Actions \n \nThe project design includes an expansion of the VSTP, as discussed above.  The expansion of VSTP to all 24 provinces will \nprovide considerable additional training to women.  The VSTP has been successful in redressing some of the imbalance in \ntraining opportunities for women. The training they receive will provide them with mostly non-paddy agriculture and service-\n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nrelated skills that will contribute to their livelihood as self-employed or unpaid family workers.    \nThe Gender and Ethnic Minorities Action Plan includes a number of measures aimed at promoting opportunities for women and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment.  These include ensuring that  (i)  dormitories for female students are secure, well equipped and have \nadequate kitchen and bathroom facilities, (ii) there is gender balance in both teaching and administrative staff at the newly \nupgraded RTCs, (iii)  training modules are developed for both male and female dominated skill areas and are gender-sensitive \nand free of gender bias, (iv)  males and females have equal access to management training and other capacity-building \ninitiatives, (v)  gender balance in the make-up of teams delivering training, (vi)  industries that employ large numbers of women \nare involved in the development and implementation of training programs, (vii)  gender-disaggregated indicators, including \nthose related to TVET outcomes, efficiency and effectiveness, are incorporated in the VETMIS and LMIS, and (viii) gender-\nbased factors are included in newly developed TVET provider registration and accreditation system.  \n \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nIII.

This gender and ethnic minorities analysis and action plan (GEMAP) is based on social \nanalysis and stakeholder consultations and highlights specific actions that will be implemented \nand monitored during implementation. The elements have been integrated into the project \ndesign, and indicators are included in the design and monitoring framework. The GEMAP was \nprepared in accordance with the Policy on Gender and Development (1998) and Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB).   \n \nA.  Background \n \n2.  Cambodia has made progress in improving gender equity and equality. The importance of \ngender equity is reflected in National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006\u20132010. In 1999 \nthe Ministry of Women's Affairs launched its first 5-year strategy, Neary Rattanak (Women are \nPrecious Gems). This was followed by Neary Rattanak II (2004-2008), and Neary Rattanak III \nwhich will be finalized in 2009. Gender mainstreaming action groups have been established in \nmost  technical  ministries  since  2004,  including  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport \n(MOEYS), chaired by a secretary or undersecretary of state. The gender mainstreaming strategic \nplan  in  education  was  updated  in  2007  for  the  period  2006\u20132010  to  increase  women's \nparticipation in the management and delivery of educational services at all levels, and to create \npositive social attitudes toward girls' education and gender equality. MOEYS is currently preparing \na gender mainstreaming policy for education.  The gender mainstreaming action plan for the labor \nand vocational training sectors 2008\u20132010 was developed in January 2008 and is currently being \nimplemented.   \n \nB.

Because of the growing mandate for an educated and skilled workforce, vocational and \ntechnical training, workforce training outside the classroom, and nonformal basic education are \nincreasing in importance. In the past, girls have been minority participants in these programs.  \nDespite improvements in education outcomes in recent years, there continue to be significant \nsociocultural and economic obstacles to girls' education in Cambodia.  Although enrollment \nrates for girls and boys are similar at the primary school level, significant disparities exist at the \nsecondary level and girls' enrollments are lower across all income and school levels. There is \nalso  significant  gender  stereotyping  at  the  TVET  level.  Female  TVET  enrollments  are low \ncompared with those of men and trainees are concentrated in traditionally female-dominated \noccupational areas. This is due to a number of factors, including the concentration of women in \ntraditional female occupations and the lack of TVET training opportunities beyond traditional \nfemale skill areas. The global economic crisis is likely to exacerbate these problems given its \nsignificant impact on sectors which employ disproportionate numbers of women in Cambodia.   \n \n4.  Most  of  the  indigenous  ethnic  minorities  in  Cambodia  live  in  the  four  northeastern \nprovinces of Ratanakiri (where they represent 66% of the population), Mondulkiri (71%), Stung \nTreng (7%), and Kratie (8%). Overall, ethnic minorities represent 1% of the country's population.  \nOne of the new PTCs will be built in Mondulkiri.    \n \nC.  Legal Framework and Regulations \n \n5.  Promotion of gender equality is one of the nine Cambodian Millennium Development \nGoals to be achieved by 2015.  This goal focuses on the elimination of gender disparities in \nbasic education, elimination of gender disparities in wage employment in all sectors, increased \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nrepresentation of women in decision making and public administration, and elimination of all \nforms of violence against women.  The Government's Rectangular Strategy for Growth states \nthat the Government will implement a systematic policy aimed at establishing skills training \nnetworks for the poor, linked to employment assistance, especially for young people and new \ngraduates in response to labor market needs.  Government and MOEYS policy is to enable and \nfacilitate a strongly demand-side approach to TVET and youth skills training through strong \npublic\u2013private partnership. MOEYS will effectively coordinate with the Ministry of Labor and \nVocational Training (MOLVT) in the implementation of policies and programs. Strategies for \nTVET were developed in 1999, which encouraged private sector participation in providing a \nlarge range of programs and activities.   \n \n6.  The NSDP includes the creation of decent work in both formal and informal sectors, the \ncreation  of  vocational  training  networks  for  both  men  and  women  in  the  workforce,  the \nestablishment of a labor force database system with data disaggregated by sex, a guarantee of \nbetter working conditions for the labor force, especially women workers inside and outside the \ncountry, addressing wage differentials between men and women and the enforcement of the \nLabor Law and Social Security Law.  The MOLVT 5-year strategic plan, 2006\u20132010 focuses on \nfour  areas:  (i)  job  creation,  (ii)  guarantee  of  better  working  conditions,  (iii)  promoting  the \nenforcement of the law on social security, and (iv) capacity development of TVET skills for \nCambodians.   \n \nTable A13: Gender and Ethnic Action Plan \n \nProject Output  Actions Proposed \nOutput 1: Formal Programs are More Industry Relevant \n1.1.
