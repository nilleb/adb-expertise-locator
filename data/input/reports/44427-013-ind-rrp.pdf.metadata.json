The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  Chhattisgarh  Public  Works \nDepartment  (CGPWD),  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  project  will  improve  about  916  kilometers  (km)  of  state  roads,  in  line  with  the \n2. \nChhattisgarh  Road  Master  Plan,  2005\u20132016.  It  will  involve  upgrading  roads  to  two  lanes, \nstrengthening  culverts  and  bridges,  and  building  new  road  sections  and  bridges.  Consulting \nsupport will be provided to support implementation of civil works.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nUnder  its  India  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132012,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  supports  all  levels  of  road  sector  development  as  a  core  infrastructure  operation  to \nfacilitate sustainable economic growth.3 The project is consistent with the strategic objective set \nout  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  which  recognizes  the  limited  network  capacity  and \nlimited  operational  capacity  for  management  of  road  assets  and  road  safety  as  the  main \nchallenges in the  road  transport  sector  in India; and recommends  the  expansion  of  support  to \nthe  state  road  sector  to  ensure  an  inclusive  approach  to  fill  the  gap  between  ADB\u2019s  financial \nsupport in the rural road sector and the Government of India\u2019s National Highway Development \nProgram. The  project  is included  in  ADB\u2019s India country  operations  business plan,  2012\u20132014 \nand  was  advanced  for  approval  in  2012  because  of  the  high  level  of  project  preparation  and \nproject readiness achieved.4 \n \n4. \nIn  India,  road  transport  accounts  for  68%  of  freight  movement  and  87%  of  passenger \ntraffic. The national highways and the secondary system are unable to cope with the rapid traffic \ngrowth. In the road sector, freight traffic increased by about 12% and passenger traffic by about \n8% per year from 2000 to 2008 (footnote 3). The rapid growth in traffic has led to congestion, \ndeterioration of roads, and increased transport costs. State roads, the secondary road system in \nIndia,  link  national  highways  with  district  headquarters  and  important  towns.  The  secondary \nsystem comprises about 13% of the road network and carries about 40% of traffic. About half of \nthe roads in the secondary system are estimated to be of poor riding quality. \n    \n5. \nChhattisgarh  is  one  of  the  underdeveloped  states  of  India  and  was  established  on  1 \nNovember 2000 through bifurcation from Madhya Pradesh state. Chhattisgarh is rich in mineral \nand  coal  deposits  and  is  located  in  the  east  of  central  India.  About  41%  of  its  21  million \npopulation  live  below  the  national  poverty  line.  Since  about  32%  of  its  population  is  tribal  and \nscheduled caste, and forests cover about 44% of its area of 135,194 square kilometers (km2), it \nis known as a tribal and forest state. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided TA to prepare the project. (ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to India \nfor Capacity Development to Enhance Project Readiness and Results Monitoring for Transport Projects. Manila TA \n7252-IND). \n\n3  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nRoads  are the main mode  of transportation  in  Chhattisgarh.  National  highways  provide \n6. \ngood  east\u2013west  connections  with  neighboring  states,  and  the  main  north\u2013south  connection \nwithin the state. However, state highways and major district roads in Chhattisgarh are mostly in \npoor condition, and are not usable in the monsoon season. This is especially true for roads in \nsouthern and northern Chhattisgarh, where most of the tribal people live.  Many roads are only \nsingle or intermediate lane roads, which lack sufficient capacity to cope with the growing traffic. \nThe total road length in Chhattisgarh is about 36,000 km, with road density less than 30 km per \n100 km2 against the national average of 100 km per 100 km2. Moreover, 80% of its existing road \nnetwork  has  an  international  roughness  index  worse  than  4.  Thus,  Chhattisgarh  lacks  an \nadequate  road  network  to  support the required mobility  between  areas with  natural resources, \nindustrial  centers,  and  economic  development  zones,  and  to  provide  better  access  to  social \namenities.  \n \n7. \nTo improve state roads, in 2002\u20132003, the CGPWD prepared a 10-Year Master Plan for \nRoad Sector Development for 2003 to 2012, which aims to (i) promote the development of six \nmain  road  corridors,  (ii)  remove  capacity  bottlenecks  from  the  network  to  better  connect  rural \nareas, and (iii) support socioeconomic development by improving road access and connectivity \namong  growth  centers.  Based  on  the  master  plan,  the  government  of  Chhattisgarh  (GOC) \nprepared  and  approved  a  priority  investment  program  for  the  improvement,  rehabilitation, \nstrengthening,  and  widening  of  about  5,000  km  of  state  roads  at  an  estimated  cost  of  about \nRs105 billion. The master plan was updated in February 2006 using ADB\u2019s TA for Preparing the \nChhattisgarh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  to  identify  road  sector  development  needs  for \n2005\u20132016.5 It recommended the development of 8,871 km of state highways and major district \nroads at a cost of Rs33 billion in 2004 prices. \n \n8. \nTo support improvement of the road network in Chhattisgarh, by implementing the road \nmaster plan, ADB provided a loan of $180 million6 in 2003 for improvement of 1,250 km of state \nroads  in  Chhattisgarh  as  well  as  TA  to  support  reforms  in  the  state  roads  sector.  The  project \nwas  successfully  implemented  and  completed  in  July  2011  but  it  faced  completion  delays  of \nabout 2.5 years. These were mainly due to (i) initial delays caused by a lack of project readiness \nat  the  time  of  loan  approval;  and  (ii)  limited  capacity  for  project  management  and  project \nimplementation in the CGPWD, which was at the time of loan approval being established as an \nindependent  department  for  the  state  of  Chhattisgarh,  which  was  bifurcated  from  Madhya \nPradesh only 3 years earlier. ADB provided capacity development for road sector management \nin Chhattisgarh through TA (footnotes 5), which supported (i) updating of the road master plan \nfor  2005\u20132016;  and  (ii) establishing  policies  for  planning  and  management  in  the  CGPWD, \nwhich  also  helped  to  prepare  this  project.  Therefore,  delays  in  project  implementation  are \nexpected  to  be  avoided,  as (i) project  readiness is  high,  with  the  detailed  design  of  all  sample \nroads  and  the  proposed  non-sample  roads  completed;  and  (ii)  the  institutional  capacity  of \nCGPWD has been substantially strengthened. \n \n9. \nThe  roads  proposed  for  inclusion  under  the  project  have  been  selected  from  this \nupdated road master plan for 2005\u20132016. The project will supplement ADB\u2019s support in the rural \nroad  sector  in  Chhattisgarh  by  linking  rural  roads  to the  state  and  national  highway  network\u2014\nproviding access for the rural population to markets, businesses, social services, and education. \n \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Chhattisgarh State Roads Sector Development. Manila \n\n(TA 3995-IND). \n\n6  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to India for the \n\nChhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project. Manila (Loan 2050-IND). \n\n\fThe project is prepared as a sector loan, as (i) the GOC has a sector development plan \n10. \nin place (the road master plan, 2005\u20132016); (ii) the CGPWD has sufficient institutional capacity \nto  implement  this  sector  development  plan,  as  demonstrated  by  the  successful  completion  of \nthe previous loan; and (iii) appropriate policies for project preparation and project management \nto implement the sector development plan have been established. The two sample subprojects \nare (i) the Simga\u2013Kurud road (SH-20, 110 km); and (ii) the Nandghat\u2013Gidhori road (SH-10, 91 \nkm).  These  represent  almost  25%  of  the  project  cost.  The  non-sample  roads  will  be  selected \nand approved in line with the process outlined in the project administration manual (PAM).7 \n  \n11. \nAs  the  sector  assessment  identified  lack  of  road  maintenance  in  the  past  as  the  key \nfactor  leading  to  the  deteriorated  status  of  many  project  roads,  the  main  focus  of  institutional \nstrengthening  by  the  capacity  development  TA  attached  to  the  proposed  loan  will  be  on \nimproving maintenance management and road asset management. The budget available to the \nCGPWD for road maintenance was found to be sufficient. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  envisaged  impact  of  the  project  is  improved  connectivity  in  Chhattisgarh.  The \n\n12. \noutcome of the project is an improved road transport system in Chhattisgarh. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe outputs of the project will be about 916 km of reconstructed and rehabilitated state \nroads in 15 road sections; the sample projects comprise of 2 roads with a total length of 201 km, \nthe proposed non-sample roads comprise of 13 roads with a total length of 715 km. Thus, after \ncompletion of this project, a total of 2,166 km out of the 8,871 km of state roads identified in the \nstate road sector development plan (2005\u20132016) for priority improvement and widening will be \ncompleted with ADB financing.  \n \n14. \nThe TA attached to the project will support improvement of the capacity of the CGPWD \nin procurement, contract management, and project management. Establishment of a road asset \nmanagement  system  initially  for  the  roads  financed  by  ADB  will  be  supported  by  the  TA \nincluding procurement, customization and commissioning of the information technology system, \ncollection of the baseline data, training of staff in the use of the road asset management system \nfor  planning  of  road  maintenance  activities,  and  training  of  staff  in  expanding  the  road  asset \nmanagement for use with all roads managed by CGPWD. \n \nD. \n \n15. \n \n16. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $300,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,8 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \ngovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $428.1 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                \n7  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8   The interest includes a maturity premium of 20 basis points. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n\n \nBase Costb \nIII. \n\nLand acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, utility \nshifting  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB. \n\nCivil Works, sample roads (2 roads, 201 km) \nCivil works, non-sample roads (13 roads, 715 km) \nConstruction supervision consulting services \nProject Management \nTotal Investment Component (A) \n\n \nContingenciesc \n \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\n \n\n     Amounta \n\n  \n\nIV. \n\n16.30 \n\n80.50 \n253.10 \n12.00 \n2.90 \n364.80 \n\n50.60 \n\nC. \n  \na  Includes taxes and duties of $18.7 million.

Based  on  the  above  loan  terms  and  this  repayment  option,  the \naverage  loan  maturity  is  18.31  years  and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.20%  per \nannum.  \n \n18. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. The ADB loan will finance 70% of the project cost. This \nis  considered  acceptable,  taking  into  account  that  the  GOC  has  allocated  its  counterpart \nfinancing for  30%  of the  cost.  By  including more  roads  in  the  loan,  the  benefits  will  be  spread \ninto more areas of the state. \n \n19. \nThe government  will  make  available  the  loan  proceeds  to  GOC  on  a  back-to-back  basis \nand GOC will bear the foreign exchange risk on the ADB loan in accordance with the policy of the \ngovernment. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Chhattisgarh \nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n300.00 \n128.10 \n428.10 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n70.00 \n30.00 \n100.00 \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nThe  executing  agency  for  the  project  will  be  the  GOC  acting  through  the  CGPWD.

Consultants  will  be  asked  to \nsubmit simplified technical proposals, and the selection will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s quality- \nand cost-based selection method using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nVI. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe project was prepared with the enhanced capacity of the CGPWD, which has been \n25. \ngained  through  the  first  loan  and  TA  provided  for  capacity  building.  The  CGPWD  engaged \ndetailed design consultants with its own funds to prepare detailed design for roads proposed for \nADB  financing,  incorporating  ADB\u2019s  requirements  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nstudies  into  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  GOC  asked  ADB  for  TA  to  conduct  due \ndiligence to ensure that the detailed design complies with ADB requirements. \n \n26. \nThe engineering design for the project roads was prepared to minimize land acquisition \nas well as social and environmental impacts. A road safety audit was performed as part of the \ndetailed  design  and  the  recommendations  were  incorporated  in  the  engineering  design  of  the \nproject. Advance actions have been taken to ensure that the construction can commence early. \nAll of these measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n \n27. \nThe selection criteria and approval process for non-sample roads is provided in the PAM \n(footnote  7).  All  non-sample  roads  must  be  technically  feasible,  economically  and  financially \nviable,  and  safeguard  reports  in  compliance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  environmental \nassessment and review framework, and the indigenous peoples planning framework must have \nbeen approved by ADB. The detailed design for the non-sample roads has been completed by \nGOC under its own funding and GOC asked ADB for TA to conduct due diligence to ensure that \nthe design for the non-sample roads complies with ADB requirements. The due diligence for the \nnon-sample roads is in an advance stage of preparation. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic evaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing life \n28. \ncycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net present value with a 12% \ndiscount  rate  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.  The  highway \ndevelopment  and  management  system  was  used  in  the  analysis,  which  focused  on  transport \ncost  savings.  Value  added  from  better  transport  links  resulting  in  new  industries  and \nemployment are not quantified in this analysis but are captured through benefits from generated \ntraffic. \n \n\n                                                \n10  The  portion  to  be  financed  by  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  will  be \napproved  as  a  subproject  under  ADB.  2011.  Cluster  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Advanced  Project \nPreparedness  for  Poverty  Reduction.  Manila  (C-CDTA  0003-IND)  following  the  procedure  for  approval  of \nsubprojects  under  cluster  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance.  Operations  Manual. \nOM D12/OP.  Manila  (issued  on  14  July).  The  TA  will  be  approved  by  the  vice-president  operations  1  under  the \npowers  currently  delegated  by  the  President  to  the  vice-presidents  to  approve  TA  projects.  See  ADB.  2008. \nIncreasing the Impact of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Technical Assistance Program. Manila (R87-08, May). \n\n\fThe EIRR for the sample roads evaluated is 19.8% for the Nandghat\u2013Gidhori road (SH-\n29. \n10, 91 km) and 21.0% for the Simga\u2013Kurud road (SH-20, 110 km). Overall, both sample roads \nare very robust, with high EIRR, satisfying the economic efficiency criteria. The sensitivity of the \nEIRR for the sample project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in the benefit and cost \nstreams. The following sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction costs increased by \n15%, (ii) time benefits reduced by 50%, (iii) benefits decreased by 15%, and (iv) a combination \nof  (i)  and  (iii).  The  results  show  that  the  quantified  economic  benefits  are  robust  to  various \nsensitivity tests. All selected roads have an EIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests.11 \n \n30. \nFinancial  sustainability.  Incremental  recurrent  costs  associated  with  the  project  are \nestimated  to  be  0.8%  of  the  current  maintenance  budget  of  Chhattisgarh  Public  Works \nDepartment  and  0.2%  of  the  overall  budget  on  an  annual  basis.  The  allocation  for  road \nmaintenance was on average around Rs2,800 million until FY2010\u201311, and has been increased \nto Rs3,040 million in FY2011\u201312 and Rs5,675 million in FY2012\u201313. The budget allocation for \nroad  maintenance  in  FY2012\u201313  was  assessed  to  fully  meet  the  maintenance  needs  for  the \nstate  roads  network  and  the  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  is  committed  to  maintain  a  similar \nlevel of budget for road maintenance works. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that funds will be \navailable to meet the maintenance costs. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nInstitutional  capacity.  A  team  of  individual  consultants  supplemented  the  CGPWD\u2019s \ncapacity  during  project  preparation.  The  CGPWD\u2019s  capacity  for  implementation  will  be \nsupported by the supervision consultant, who will also assist with the approval process for non-\nsample roads. For long-term capacity strengthening, TA will be provided to make the CGPWD \nmore effective in developing, operating, and maintaining state roads. \n \n32. \nFinancial  management. The CGPWD has experience in implementing an ADB-funded \nproject. It  has  satisfactory  capacity  for  project financial  accounting and  sufficient knowledge of \nADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures.  The  TA  will  support  the  introduction  of  a  computerized \naccounting  system  in  the  project  implementation  unit  and  strengthening  of  the  financial \nmanagement system.  \n \n33. \nProcurement.  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  civil  works  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding. All consulting firms will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using quality- and \ncost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  The  CGPWD  has  prepared  the  bid \ndocuments  for  the  first  four  works  contracts  and  the  supervision  consultant  for  the  project  as \npart of advance procurement action.  \n \n34. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  GOC,  and  the  CGPWD.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n35. \nChhattisgarh state has a population of 20,833,803, out of which 16,648,056 persons live \nin  rural  areas,  based  on  the  2001  census.  The  state  has  a  population  density  of  151  per  km2 \n\n                                                \n11 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nand almost 31.8% of the total population of the state is tribal. Chhattisgarh has a high incidence \nof poverty in the country\u201440.9% of people live below the poverty line.12 \n \n36. \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  surveyed  about  25,000  households  and  men  and \nwomen participated in focus group discussions. The majority stated that the project will increase \neconomic and employment opportunities by improving linkages to markets, production centers, \nand public and social service facilities. \n \nGender.  Focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  women  from  different \n37. \nsocioeconomic groups in the project influence area. Women stated that the project will benefit \nthem;  better  roads  will  promote  better  transport  services  and  give  everyone  better  access  to \nsocial  services,  markets,  workplaces,  higher  education,  health  facilities,  and  employment \nopportunities. \n \n38. \nThe  same  effects  are  expected  to  be  attained  under  this  project  for  both  men  and \nwomen.  The  bidding  documents  provide  clauses  designed  to  ensure  that  all  civil  works \ncontractors  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ  child  labor;  encourage  the \nemployment  of  the  poor,  particularly  women;  and  do  not  offer  different  wages  to  men  and \nwomen, particularly for work of equal value. \n \nHIV  and  AIDS.  India\u2019s  National  AIDS  Control  Organisation  estimates  the  number  of \n39. \npersons  living  with  HIV  in  India  at  2.31  million  in  2007,  and  adult  HIV  prevalence  at  0.34%. \nAccording to India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation, HIV infection is typically concentrated \namong the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex workers, drug \nusers,  migrant  laborers, and truck  drivers). These groups,  particularly  truckers,  propel the  HIV \nepidemic, and studies indicate that the infection is spreading rapidly to the general population. \nBut Chhattisgarh is a low-prevalence state. Based on the poverty and social assessment, there \nis no risk that the project will increase HIV/AIDS incidence. Contractors will carry out HIV/AIDS \nawareness  for  their  laborers  at  work  sites  and  this  will  be  monitored  by  the  construction \nsupervision consultants during project implementation. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n40. \nEnvironmental impact. The project is classified category B for environmental impact in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  two  sample  subprojects \ninclude  rehabilitation  of  existing  roads  within  the  right-of-way  for  most  of  their  length.  No \nprotected  areas,  environmentally  sensitive  habitats,  or  reserved  forests  exist  in  or  near  the \nproject area. Therefore, the project is unlikely to cause any significant, adverse, or irreversible \nenvironmental impacts. Initial environmental examination (IEE) reports, including environmental \nmanagement plans (EMP), have been prepared for each subproject. Anticipated impacts, which \nare mainly confined to the construction stage, include generation of dust, noise, exhaust, wastes, \nimpacts on water quantity and quality, soil erosion and siltation, tree removal, and occupational \nhealth  and  safety  issues.  These  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  mitigation  measures \nprovided  in  the  EMP,  which  will  be  included  in  the  agreement  with  the  contractor.  Extensive \npublic  consultations  have  been  conducted  while  preparing  the  IEE,  and  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism  has  also  been  prepared.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  environment  safeguards-related  preparatory  work  for  the \nnon-sample subprojects and to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \n\n                                                \n12  Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Office of Registrar General & Census Commissioner. 2002. Census \n\nof India 2001. New Delhi. \n\n \n\n\fthe environmental policies of the Government of India. According to the EARF, the non-sample \nsubprojects  will  follow  a  similar  approach  for  project  preparation  and  implementation  as  the \nsample subprojects. The EARF as well as the IEE reports for the sample subprojects have been \nendorsed  by  the  executing  agency  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  as  required  by  ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011). \n \n41. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for \nresettlement impacts. Resettlement plans have been prepared for the two sample subprojects. \nA resettlement framework has been prepared for the project. For all the subsequent subprojects \nthat  have  resettlement  impacts,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nsafeguard provisions in the resettlement framework. \n \nThe  project  was  developed  with  a  view  to  avoiding  or  minimizing  land  acquisition  and \n42. \ninvoluntary resettlement by adopting the most feasible technical design. The proposed widening \nof roads will occur within the existing right-of-way. A full census was conducted, based on the \ndetailed designs for the two sample subprojects. Resettlement plans were prepared for the two \nsample  subprojects  according  to  the  government\u2019s  National  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement \nPolicy (2007), the state resettlement policy, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. According \nto the census carried out for the two sample subprojects, 1,013 persons will be displaced, out of \nwhich  four  households  will  be  physically  displaced  and  143  economically  displaced.  The  total \nresettlement  budget  for  the  sample  subprojects  is  Rs14,961,691.  Compensation  rates  for  the \nloss  of  land  and  structures,  shifting  assistance,  income  restoration  assistance,  and  additional \nsupport  for  vulnerable  groups  are  provided  in  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement \nplans.  Meaningful  consultation  and  information  disclosure  were  undertaken  during  the \npreparation of resettlement plans, including with (i) project-displaced persons, and (ii) the public \nthrough  the  ADB  website.  If  any  changes  or  additional  land  requirements  or  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  are  identified  during  implementation,  a  related  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared  or  modified  according  to  the  applicable  laws  referred  to  in  the  resettlement  plan. \nADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before further implementation of the relevant section of the \nsubproject. \n \n43. \nImpact  on indigenous people. The project is classified category B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Scheduled tribes account for 31.8% of the total population \nin  Chhattisgarh.  The  tribal  population  is  scattered\u2014not  concentrated  in  any  particular  sample \nsubproject  areas\u2014and  interacts  freely  with  the  outside  community.  The  study  undertaken  for \npreparation  of  the  sample  subprojects  did  not  show  any  difference  in  impact  between \nindigenous  and  non-indigenous  groups  in  the  project  locations.  The  poverty  and  social \nassessment  survey  confirmed  that  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  project  will  not  differ \nsignificantly  for  tribal  groups  compared  with  the  remainder  of  the  population.  In  addition, \nmeaningful  consultations  were  conducted  with  both  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders  to \nobtain a comprehensive perspective on the project and its impacts, and to obtain an estimate of \nlosses they would suffer and to develop ways to mitigate those losses. Special provisions have \nbeen  made  under  the  resettlement  plans  to  address  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  An \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  address  any  unanticipated \nimpacts on indigenous peoples during the implementation of existing or additional subprojects. If \nany significant impacts on indigenous peoples are identified, an indigenous peoples plan will be \nprepared in accordance with the indigenous peoples planning framework and submitted to ADB \nfor approval. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n44.
