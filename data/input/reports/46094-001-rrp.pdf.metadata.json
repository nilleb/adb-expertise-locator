About 670,000 low-income families will benefit from improved access to social services and \nessential infrastructure.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nfor \n\n3. \nIndonesia  is  one  of  the  fastest  urbanizing  countries  in  Asia.  Currently,  about  half  of  the \npopulation (51%) lives in cities; this is projected to increase to 68% by 2025. Many of the growing \ncities  are  having  difficulty  coping  with  the  rapid  increase  of  in-migrants  seeking  new  economic \nopportunities.  They  are  forced  to  settle  in  disadvantaged  neighborhoods  due  to  limited  financial \nresources, lack of affordable adequate housing, and/or failure to find well-paid jobs.2 In 2011, about \n12.5%  of  the  urban  population  was  forced  to  live  in  slum  areas.3 The  project  will  demonstrate  an \nintegrated  approach  to  upgrade  slum  neighborhoods  by  (i)  providing  resources  directly  to \ndisadvantaged communities to improve their living conditions; (ii) establishing new settlements for \npoor  families;  and  (iii)  as  part  of  the  capacity  development  component,  assisting  local \nadministrations in managing pro-poor urban development including the development of multisector \nstrategies to address urban poverty issues beyond infrastructure upgrading.  \n \nBetter  public  infrastructure  is  considered  vital  to  sustain  inclusive  economic  growth  and \n4. \nstimulate  economic  opportunities \ninfrastructure \nimprovements  have  not  kept  up  with  the  rapid  urbanization;  infrastructure  investment  has  lagged \neconomic development. Most infrastructure and public services in poor neighborhoods do not meet \nthe  needs  of  the  increasing  number  of  inhabitants.  Environmental  and  social  problems  related  to \naccessibility  to  adequate  services  for  people\u2019s  daily  needs  are  increasing  due  to  widespread \nconstraints  in  the  provision  of  clean  water;  insufficient  sanitation  facilities;  deteriorating  roads, \npathways,  and  drainage;  ineffective  flood  control;  lack  of  constant  power  supply;  and  poor  solid \nwaste management. Only about 40% of the urban population has access to safe water; about 28% \ndoes  not  have  access  to  improved  sanitation  facilities.  About  35%  of  urban  areas  lack  proper \ndrainage  systems.  To  meet  local  needs  the  project  will  provide  grants  to  slum  communities  for \nupgrading basic infrastructure including improving sanitation facilities and access to safe water. \n \n5. \nProblems  are  aggravated  by  the  absence  of  sound  land  use  planning  and  land \nmanagement  regulations  that  are  contributing  to  increased  congestion  and  haphazard  informal \ndevelopment.  A  multifaceted  approach  is  required  to  address  these  challenges,  including \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  city  administrations  to  manage  urban  development  in  an \nenvironmentally and socially sustainable manner; modernizing land policies and permit regulations; \nexpanding  access  to,  and  targeting  of,  housing  finance  and  subsidies;  increasing  community \ninvolvement  in  spatial  planning;  and  engaging  the  private  sector  in  development  planning.  Rapid \n\nthe  growing  urban  population.  Yet \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Overall poverty incidence in Indonesia fell to 12% in 2012; the national urban poverty rate was estimated at 9.1%. \n3  The  official  government  publication,  Report  on  the  Achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  in  Indonesia \n\n2011, states that 12.57% of the urban population was living in slums. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nurbanization  has  triggered  growing  demand  for  housing;  the  availability  of  affordable  housing  in \ncities for low-income groups appears to be declining.4 \n \n6. \nThe  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132015  (RPJMN)  identifies  insufficient \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  as  one  cause  of  poverty.  Thus  improving  basic  infrastructure  is \nconsidered  an  effective  catalyst  to  reduce  poverty  and  close  gaps  in  income  inequality  in \ndisadvantaged  urban  neighborhoods.  While  Indonesia  has  generally  made  good  progress  in \naccelerating  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  the  MDG  targets  for \nachieving  significant  improvement  in  the  lives  of  slum  dwellers  (MDG  target  7D)  and  halving  the \nproportion  of  urban  households  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic \nsanitation  (MDG  target  7C)  need  special  attention.5 The  project,  which  aims  to  upgrade  basic \npublic infrastructure in slums, will contribute to meeting both MDG targets. To address issues of the \nrapid  urbanization,  the  government  launched  the  Cities  without  Slums  Program6 and  issued  Law \nNo.  1,  2011,  Housing  and  Settlement  Areas.7 To  contribute  to  the  Cities  without  Slums  Program, \nthe government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  prepare  and  partly  finance the \nNeighborhood  Upgrading  and  Shelter  Project  (Phase  2)  to  help  20  cities  improve  basic \ninfrastructure and living conditions in selected slums.8 \n \n7. \nThe project builds on lessons from the government's foremost poverty reduction program, the \nNational  Program for  Community  Empowerment (PNPM  Mandiri),  which  adopts  a  CDD  approach \nand provides nationwide assistance for improving essential social services and basic infrastructure \nby providing block grants to poor communities.9 Addressing poverty issues and basic infrastructure \nneeds  through  CDD  is  considered  more  effective,  sustainable,  and  equitable  than  use  of \ncentralized  arrangements,  as  communities  become  active  partners  in  development.  The  CDD \napproach  adopted  under  the  PNPM  gives  communities  control  over  planning  decisions  and \ninvestment  resources,  and  focuses  on  community  empowerment  to  improve  basic  infrastructure \nand service delivery. Community participatory planning and design of specific investments is a key \nfeature.  The  community  controls  resources;  hence  funds  are  transferred  directly  to  community-\nmanaged  bank  accounts.  The  community  also  manages  project  implementation  supported  by \nconsultants and facilitators when required. The CDD process is designed to systematically mobilize \nthe capacity of communities to prioritize their development needs, design activities, seek technical \nassistance,  manage  resources,  and  implement  and  sustain  development  actions.10 Building  on \n\n                                                 \n4   According  to  World  Bank  estimates  published  in  the  Indonesia  Economic  Quarterly  Report  (March  2013),  600,000\u2013 \n900,000  housing  units  are  required  per  year.  The  number  increases  as  urbanization  continues:  700,000\u20131,000,000 \nhousing units are estimated to be needed per year during 2014\u20132021. \n\n5   The  2015  MDG  target  for  the  proportion  of  the  urban  population  living  in  slums  is  6%;  in  2011,  12.6%  of  the  urban \npopulation  lived  in  slums.  The  2015  MDG  target  for  the  proportion  of  households  with  sustainable  access  to  an \nimproved water source is 75.5%; in 2011, 40.5% of urban households had access to an improved water source, 72.5% \nhad access to basic sanitation. The proportion of households with access to safe water and basic sanitation in slum \nareas is assumed to be much lower. \n\n6   The Cities without Slums Program is incorporated in the National Long-Term Development Plan, 2005\u20132025. It aims to \nreduce slum areas in cities by 2025 by promoting concerted initiatives by the central and local governments, private \nsector, and civil society. \n\n7   The law specifies the roles and responsibilities of central and local governments for providing housing and settlements, \n\nincluding housing for the poor, and upgrading slum areas. \n\n8   Relevance of the project is discussed in the Sector Assessment (Summary): Urban Infrastructure (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9   PNPM  Mandiri  was  launched  in  2007.  The  RPJM,  2010\u20132014  includes  PNPM  Mandiri  as  a  development  tool  to \n\naccelerate poverty alleviation with an indicative budget allocation of $6,754 million over 5 years. \n\n10  Encouraged  by  the  success  of  the  PNPM  scheme,  three  ADB-financed  infrastructure  improvement  projects  were \naligned  with  the  PNPM  using  the  project  loan  modality  and  adopting  a  CDD  approach:  (i)  ADB.  2008.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Rural \nInfrastructure  Support  to  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Project.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Loan and Administration of Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Indonesia for the Urban \nSanitation and Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nlessons  of  the  overall  PNPM  program  and  the  latest  ADB-financed  CDD  projects,  the  proposed \nADB project will follow a similar CDD approach.11 \n \n8. \nThe project builds on lessons from (i) the first Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector \nProject;12 (ii) the first and second Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM  Mandiri Projects, and \n(iii)  the  ongoing  Urban  Sanitation  and  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Project \n(footnote  10). The  Ministry  of  Public Works (MPW) has  been  implementing  the  projects.  Lessons \nincorporated  into  the  project  design  include  (i)  involve  beneficiaries  in  the  planning  and \nimplementation of neighborhood upgrading, (ii) support development of strong political commitment \nto support pro-poor urban development, (iii) promote integrated development approaches and link \nupgrading  investments  of  individual  communities  with  overall  city  development  planning,  (iv) \nreduce  the  number  of  project  cities  and  neighborhoods  to  lessen  transaction  costs  in  project \nmanagement, (v) increase the investment amount per neighborhood to boost means for improving \nliving conditions in slums, (vi) provide transparent fund flow and implementation mechanisms, and \npromote  community  control  of  decision-making  over  resources  and  investment  choices;  (vii) \ndevelop strong accountability procedures, such as public disclosure of budgets and contracts; and \n(viii) establish effective mechanisms for operation and maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure.13 The \nproject  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132014  for  Indonesia  and  will \ncontribute  to  achievement  of  the  targets  of  the  results  framework  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2012\u20132014  for  Indonesia  and  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.14 The  country  partnership  strategy \nincludes  support  for  government  efforts  to  achieve  more  inclusive  growth  by  improving  basic \ninfrastructure  for  poor  communities  in  selected  cities.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB's  Urban \nOperational  Plan,  2012\u20132020  as  it  (i)  provides  support  to  urban  shelter  sector  programs;  (ii) \ncontributes  to  upgrading  of  local  infrastructure  in  the  four  core  areas  of  water  supply,  sanitation, \nwater  management,  and  urban  transport;  and  (iii)  improves  community  services,  employment \nopportunities, and livelihood development.15  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the project will be improved living conditions in urban areas. The outcome will \n\n9. \nbe improved infrastructure and access to service delivery in slum neighborhoods in 20 cities.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  institutional  capacity  for  managing  pro-poor  urban \ndevelopment  strengthened;  (ii)  infrastructure  in  slum  neighborhoods  upgraded;  and  (iii)  new \nsettlements for poor families established.  \n \n                                                 \n11  The  project  loan  modality  was  applied  as  the  project  is  limited  to  providing  targeted  support  to  improve  basic \ninfrastructure in slum neighborhoods of 20 cities, adopts a CDD approach, and does not address overall policy issues \nor legal and regulatory frameworks, which would require involving other line ministries and government agencies. \n\n12  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the Republic \nof  Indonesia  for  the  Neighborhood  Upgrading  and  Shelter  Sector  Project.  Manila.  The  project  closed  in  December \n2010 and is rated successful. ADB. 2011. Completion Report: Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project in \nIndonesia. Manila. \n\n13 In addition to ADB, other development partners have had a long-standing engagement with Indonesia in infrastructure \ndevelopment.  In  1999,  the  WB  started  the  financing  of  the  Urban  Poverty  Project,  which  aimed  at  reducing  urban \npoverty by increasing income of the urban poor, empower urban communities and improve local government capacity \nto  assist  the  urban  poor.  The  UPP  has  created  momentum  for  addressing  poverty  issues  and  basic  infrastructure \nneeds  through  CDD,  which  was  further  developed  under  the  Government\u2019s  PNPM  scheme.  An  overview  on  the \ndevelopment cooperation related to urban infrastructure is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 6. \n14  ADB.  2012.

Manila. \n\n15  The  project  will  contribute  to  inclusive  development,  planning,  and  governance  through  capacity  building  support \n\nprovided under output 1 and adoption of a CDD approach.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nfrom \n\nthe  20 \n\nfor  selected  staff \n\n11. \nInstitutional  capacity  for  managing  pro-poor  urban  development  strengthened.  The \nproject  will  provide  capacity  building  assistance  to  local  administrations  in  the  project  cities  for  \n(i)  community-driven  settlement  upgrading  and  new  site  development  (NSD);  (ii)  building \ncommunity  member  awareness  on  sanitation  and  hygiene;  (iii)  project  management;  (iv)  public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  for  NSD,  with  special  focus  on  the  poor;  and  (v)  O&M  of  upgraded  facilities \nand NSD through community-based efforts. Within the first year of project implementation and with \nthe  help  of  consultants,  each  participating  city  will  conduct  a  capacity  assessment  identifying \nchallenges  and  capacity  building  needs  to  strengthen  spatial  planning  and  pro-poor  urban \ndevelopment.  Based  on the  results  of the  assessments,  city  administrations  will  prepare  capacity \nbuilding  and  training  proposals,  which  will  be  consolidated  by  MPW\u2019s  Directorate  General  of \nHuman  Settlements  (DGHS),  the  executing  agency.  DGHS  will  facilitate  joint  training  and  study \nprograms,  and  other  capacity  building  assistance \nlocal \nadministrations.  To  address  poverty  issues  beyond  infrastructure  upgrading,  the  project  will \nsupport the preparation of multisector slum improvement action plans. The plans will represent an \nattempt to combine physical environmental improvements with other support mechanisms that will \nrequire collective efforts from entities beyond MPW. \n \nInfrastructure in slum neighborhoods upgraded. About $60 million of the loan proceeds \n12. \nwill be allocated for upgrading basic infrastructure in slum neighborhoods in 20 cities. Participating \ncities have been preliminarily selected based on the following criteria: (i) local governments have \napproved  spatial  plans  (RTRWs)  and  development  strategies  (SPPIPs)  that  identify  slum  areas \nand  provide  guidance  to  improve  slums;  (ii)  at  least  5,000  households  live  in  slum  areas;  (iii)  at \nleast  5%  of  households located  in  slum  neighborhoods fall  in  the  category  of  extreme  poor;16 (iv) \nformal confirmation of the local government to participate in the project; and (v) confirmation that \nhouseholds  without  legal  title  to  the  land  (informal  dwellers)  in  the  selected  slum  neighborhoods \nwould be allowed to participate in and benefit from the project.17 \n \n13. \nTo be selected to participate in the project, local governments of the project cities will sign a \nmemorandum  of  agreement  with  DGHS  validating  their  readiness  and  contributions,  including  (i) \nestablishing  a  local  coordination  office  (LCO)  with  experienced  and  committed  staff;  (ii)  providing \nadditional resources to finance complementary infrastructure works and to improve public services \nin slum areas; (iii) ensuring compliance to adopt a CDD approach to identify the specific type and \nmix of interventions to be financed by the project based on needs assessments carried out by the \ncommunities; and (iv) adjusting and/or revising spatial plans and development strategies based on \nfeedback received during the consultation process with slum communities.  \n \n14. \nProject  funds  will  be  allocated  for  each  city  based  on  the  number  of  slums:  (i)  cities  with \nmore than 100 slums will receive up to $4.5 million; (ii) cities with 50\u2013100 slums will receive up to \n$3.5  million;  and  (iii)  cities  with  less  than  50  slums  will  receive  up  to  $2.4  million.  Funding  for \ninfrastructure  upgrading  investments  provided  to  each  slum  will  vary  and  depend  on  the  actual \nsituation and needs of the communities. \n \n15. \nCity  administrations  will  identify  the  specific  slum  neighborhoods  to  be  supported  by  the \nproject based on a close consultation process with slum communities and agreed selection criteria. \nThe  final  list  of  project  slum  neighborhoods  will  be  confirmed  by  a  bupati  (mayor)  decree  and \n\n                                                 \n16 Households living on a monthly income of less than Rp2.2 million are considered extreme poor. \n17  During  project  preparation,  50  cities  were  considered  eligible  to  participate  in  the  project  based  on  the  precondition \ncriteria. During a thorough consultation process between DGHS and the candidate cities, which included field visits to \nexplain  the  project  scope  and  CDD  approach  to  the  city  administrations  and  community  groups,  20  cities  confirmed \ntheir commitment to participate in the project. Based on lessons from earlier CDD infrastructure projects executed by \nMPW, the formal commitment of the city administration to participate in and contribute to project implementation and \nspecify resources is considered crucial. The preliminary list of project cities includes Ambon, Batam, Bandar Lampung, \nBanjarmasin,  Bengkulu,  Bima,  Bone,  Kapuas,  Kendari,  Makassar,  Palangkaraya,  Palembang,  Palopo,  Pasuruan, \nPekalongan, Semarang, Serang, Sukabumi, Tanjung Jabung Barat, Tanjung Balai. \n\n\f5 \n\nsubmitted to ADB by DGHS for endorsement within 3 months after loan effectiveness. The process \nof engaging with slum communities will start with road shows in each project city to inform potential \nslum  communities  of  the  project  scope  and  approach,  and  the  selection  criteria  to  be  eligible  for \nparticipation  in  the  project.  Selection  criteria  are  based  on  socioeconomic  indicators,  and  the \nreadiness and commitment to participate in the project.18 Overall information on the project and the \nselection  process  will  be  publicly  disclosed  in  each  project  city.  Cities  with  more  than  100  slum \nlocations will nominate at least 20 slum neighborhoods, but not more than 35; cities with 50 to 100 \nslum locations will nominate at least 15 slum neighborhoods, but not more than 20; and cities with \nless than 50 slum locations will nominate up to 15. \n \n16. \nEach  selected  neighborhood  will  work  through  a  community  implementation  organization \n(BKM). Supported by consultant teams, BKMs will facilitate infrastructure assessments for the slum \nneighborhoods, to be carried out by the community members, to assess basic infrastructure needs \nin  the  community;  evaluate  community  implementation  capacity;  establish  efficient  planning  and \ndecision-making  processes;  formulate  neighborhood  upgrading  plans  (NUAPs)  and  specific \nsubproject investment plans; prepare simple technical designs; organize works to be carried out by \nthe community members; and formulate O&M plans of completed project facilities.  \n \n17. \nTo achieve a wider development impact for cities and address infrastructure issues beyond \nthe boundaries of individual slum neighborhoods, LCOs with the help of consultants will establish a \nconsultation mechanism for project BKMs, and the city administration to formulate a consolidated \ninfrastructure upgrading investment plan, which will integrate the individual NUAPs. In the process \nof preparing the overall infrastructure upgrading investment plan, BKMs, and the city administration \nwill jointly evaluate NUAPs from each slum neighborhood, agree on collaboration to link upgrading \nactivities between neighborhoods, concur on fund allocations per neighborhood within the overall \ninvestment amount for the respective project city, and revise individual NUAPs to be aligned with \nthe  agreed  consolidated  infrastructure  upgrading  investment  plan  for  the  project  city.  The \nconsolidated  city  investment  plans  will  be  approved  by  DGHS  and  ADB  and  include  the  revised \nNUAPs  with  agreed  investment  amounts  for  each  project  slum  neighborhood.  The  project  will \nensure  that  the  consultation  process  is  conducted  in  a  transparent  and  fair  manner.  During  this \nconsultation  process,  BKMs,  and  city  administrations  will  assess  whether  individual  NUAPs  are \naligned with spatial plans and development strategies at the city level and agree on any necessary \nadjustments. \n \n18. \nBased on the complexity of infrastructure upgrading plans, civil works will be carried out by \nthe  communities  or  by  firms  to  be  engaged  by  DGHS.  Following  the  PNPM  approach,  funds  for \nworks  implemented  by  communities  will  be  based  on  contracts  between  the  BKM,  and  city \nadministration19 and  transferred  through  block  grants  directly  from  the  project  imprest  account  to \ncommunity  bank  account  managed  by  the  BKMs.20 Detailed  guidance  related  to  eligibility  criteria \nand  procedures  to  use  grant  funds  will  be  explained  in  the  guidelines  (JUKLAK)  and \n\n                                                 \n18  Selection criteria for the project neighborhoods include: (i) the neighborhood must be located in a participating city; (ii) \nformal confirmation of the head of the neighborhood or BKM verifying (a) interest and willingness to participate in the \nproject, (b) contribution to the planning and implementation of upgrading activities, (c) willingness to establish required \nO&M  arrangements  for  facilities  constructed  by  the  project;  and  (iii)  the  neighborhood  must  be  listed  as  a  slum \nneighborhood in the applicable city development plan. \n\n19  Contracts  will  specify  payment  modalities.  Detailed  information  on  the  fund  flow  mechanism  and  implementation  of \nneighborhood upgrading plans is in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n\n20  No  withdrawal  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  made  for  civil  works  for  output  2  until,  among  other  things:  (i)  the \nseparate bank account for the BKM of the corresponding slum neighborhood has been opened, (ii) the consolidated \ninvestment  plan  of  the  corresponding  participating  town,  integrating  the  NUAPs  of  project  slum  neighborhoods  has \nbeen  approved by  ADB  and DGHS,  and  (iii)  a  contract  for  the  relevant subproject  has been concluded  between  the \nBKM for the relevant slum neighborhood and the city administration. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nimplementation manuals (JUKNIS) to be developed with the help of consultants and approved by \nDGHS at the beginning of the project.  \n  \n19. \nNew  settlements  for  poor  families  established.  A  model  of  partnership  for  each  NSD \nbetween  the  central  government,  local  administrations,  developers,  and  financial  institutions  to \nprovide  housing  for  poor  people  will  be  developed.  The  project  will  take  a  catalytic  role  to  develop \nexamples  for  replication  and  promote  public\u2013private  alliances  in  five  cities 21  whereby:  (i)  local \ngovernments will provide land from their own resources and issue land titles for potential new house \nowners  (titles  are  required  as  collateral  to  receive  loans  from  financial  institutions);  (ii)  MPW  will \nprovide the basic infrastructure (roads, water and electricity supply, and sanitation facilities) financed \nby  loan  proceeds;  (iii)  private  developers  will  prefinance  the  house  construction,  and  coordinate \nconnections to the main networks of service providers (water and electricity); (iv) financial institutions \nwill provide loans to poor families to buy (or construct) new houses; (v) NGOs, in close cooperation \nwith  the  local  administration,  will  organize  socialization  campaigns  to  explain  the  NSD  scheme  to \npoor  families  living  in  slum  neighborhoods  of  the  project  city,  develop  transparent  criteria  to  select \npoor  beneficiary families  to be  eligible to  apply  under the  NSD  scheme, and facilitate  the  selection \nprocess. To establish the basic infrastructure for new settlements, the project will provide about $5.0 \nmillion to finance civil works. The legal title to the land of the NSD sites must be held in the name of \nthe participating cities. Within 18 months after loan effectiveness, the project cities will present a full \nNSD proposal, which is endorsed by the bupati (mayor), to ADB and DGHS for review and approval. \nThe  proposal  will  include  (i)  proof  of  land  ownership;  (ii)  detailed  technical  designs  with  cost \nestimates for infrastructure to be financed by the loan proceeds; (iii) basis for the selection of a local \ndeveloper; (iv) proposed loan schemes, including commitments from financial institutions to provide \nloans  to  poor  families  under  the  NSD  scheme;  and  (v)  a  transparent  selection  process  to  identify \nslum  dwellers  prepared  to  buy  houses  at  the  NSD  site.  DGHS  will  ensure  that  the  houses \nconstructed  under  the  project  will  not  be  sold  or  resold  within  10  years  after  completion.  The \nproposed NSD sites will be vacant and ready for infrastructure development, and will not be subject \nto environmental threats. \n \nD. \n \n20. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $102.0 million (Table 1).  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.  \n\nBase Cost \n\n  Output 1: Institutional capacity strengthened \n  Output 2: Slum neighborhoods upgraded \n  Output 3: New settlements developed \n \n\n  Subtotal (A) \n\nContingencies \nFinancing Charges During Implementationa \nTotal (A+B+C) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  \nC.  \n\nAmounta \n \n 5.0 \n76.4 \n16.2 \n97.6 \n 0.4 \n 4.0 \n102.0 \n\n  a Includes interest and commitment charges.

DGHS  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  project  will  be \nimplemented from July 2014 to December 2017. In each project city, a local project management \nunit  will  be  established  with  experienced  and  qualified  staff  to  facilitate  project  implementation. \nTheir tasks are described in detail in the PAM. All procurement financed under the ADB loan will be \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsultant  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2014\u2013December 2017 \n31 December 2017 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies  DGHS and administrations of 20 city districts \n(iv)  Project implementation unit  Project management unit, DGHS, MPW, 5 staff  \n\nHousing and Settlements Steering Committee \nMembers include BAPPENAS, MOF, MOHA, MPW, MPH, BPN, MOH \nDGHS within MPW \n\nBlock grants for basic \ninfrastructure upgrading \nComplex infrastructure upgrading \n\nConsulting services \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\n70 contracts \n\n$41.0 million \n\n1,000 contracts \n\nCity and district project management units in 20 participating cities and/or \ndistricts, 3\u20135 staff in each unit \nCommunity \nprocurement  \nProcurement through \nDGHS        \n2,297 person-months of national consultants \nFour management consultant packages will be procured using advance \ncontracting, including the national project management consultant team \n(estimated contract amount $6,623,000).

The \nexpected  economic  benefits  are  significant  and  include  (i)  improved  public  health  status  and \nreduced  per  capita  costs  for  health  care  and  medical  treatment  due  to  increased  coverage  of \nsanitation  services,  improved  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  and  improved  hygiene  particularly  in \ndensely  populated  neighborhoods;  (ii) \nthrough \nincreased \nimproving  essential  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  considerable  short-term  employment  generation. \nImproving the overall living environments of poor urban neighborhoods where people are engaged \nin informal economic activities will enhance income-earning opportunities of small home industries, \nparticularly related to food processing, handicraft, batik, and small repair services. Upgrading roads \nand pathways, and improving water and power supply will improve the overall business conditions \nfor informal entrepreneurs (including food-stall owners, small restaurants, repair shops). Improved \nroads  will  also  provide  easier  and  safer  access  for  residents  to  reach  their  places  of  work. \nTransportation costs in general will be reduced to improve access to local markets to deliver goods \nand services and buy products, and to schools and health centers. Improving drainage systems will \ncontribute to reducing damage and losses due to flooding.22 \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe  project  will  adopt  a  CDD  approach,  which  is  a  key  feature  of  instituting  good \ngovernance  practices. It  will  strengthen  the  ability  of  communities  to  articulate their needs  and to \nseek support for development plans; it will improve the ability of district governments to respond to \nthe  demands  of  poor  communities.  Evaluations  of  CDD  infrastructure  projects  suggest  that \ncommunity  choices  are  more  attuned  to  local  needs;  sustainable  O&M  is  more  likely  as \ninfrastructure  projects  chosen  by  the  community  members  have  a  direct  benefit.  Participation  in \nplanning  and  implementing  infrastructure  projects  yields  better  oversight  and  less  corruption,  and \ncommunities  become  active  partners  in  development.  The  project  will  ensure  transparency  to \nenable the community to know every aspect of the project decision-making process. Management \nof  funds  will  be  transparent  and  shared  with  the  entire  community.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. Within 3 months \nof loan effectiveness, DGHS will establish a project-specific website for public disclosure on use of \nthe loan proceeds, including details of procurement and contract awards.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe  project  will  target  poor  communities  in  slum  areas  that  lack  basic  services  and \ninfrastructure. The selected neighborhoods will have higher than average poverty rates and lower \nthan  average  achievement  of  the  MDGs.  Improvements  of  basic  infrastructure  will  increase \nincome-earning  opportunities  and  accessibility  to  education  and  health  services  for  the  poor  and \nnear  poor.  Improved  sanitation  and  cleaner  environments  resulting  from  project  activities  will \nreduce diseases linked to unsafe water and poor hygiene, thus contributing to improving the overall \nhealth  status  of  the  poor.23 The  project  will  address  the  key  gender  issues,  including  (i)  limited \nparticipation  and  leadership  of  women  in  local  decision-making  processes  related  to  community \ninfrastructure  investments;  (ii)  insufficient  access  of  women  to  employment  opportunities  in  local \ncivil  and  maintenance  works;  and  (iii)  inadequate  opportunities  for  female  government  staff  to \naccess  technical  training  opportunities.  The  project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  includes  (i)  developing \nslum  improvement  action  plans  based  on  the  needs  of  women  and  men  for  public  facilities;  \n(ii)  ensuring  women  comprise  40%  of  participants  in  decision-making  activities  and  20%  of  BKM \n                                                 \n22  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n23  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nmembers,  in  aggregate;  (iii)  undertaking  gender  audits  of  all  community  investment  plans;  (iv) \nproviding 20% of paid work created by the project to women; (v) ensuring women comprise 30% of \ntrainees  in  all  project  capacity  development  activities  and  30%  of  user  group  members;  (vi) \nproviding  gender  training  to  all  key  project  stakeholders;  and  (vii)  developing  and  using  gender \nindicators to track implementation of the gender action plan and project outcomes for women.24 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  will  not  include  physical  displacement; \nless  than  10%  of  productive  assets  will  be  lost  as  a  result  of  involuntary  land  acquisition.  In  the \ncontext of specific neighborhood upgrading activities, i.e., construction of public sanitation facilities, \nsmall  amounts  of  land  may  be  acquired  from  community  members  or  donated  voluntarily.25 The \nlegal  title  of  the  land  for  NSD  will  be  in  the  name  of  the  project  city;  the  land  will  be  vacant  and \nready for  implementation.  As the  scope  of  land acquisition  is  expected  to  be  insignificant  with  no \nexpected  resettlement,  the  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Since \ncommunities  will  be  identifying  specific  interventions  during  project  implementation,  potential \nissues  related  to  land  acquisition  can  be  identified  only  after  the  type  of  infrastructure  upgrading \nand  the  specific  location  are  agreed  on.  A  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  to  provide \nguidance to communities on managing land acquisition.26 The NUAPs will  record the potential for \nland acquisition. \n \nEnvironment.  Overall,  the  infrastructure  upgrading  activities  are  expected  to  create \n27. \npositive impacts on the environment and improve the livelihoods at slum communities. The project \nis  categorized  as  environment  category  B.  Since  it  will  use  a  CDD  approach,  communities  will \nidentify the specific project locations and types of infrastructure interventions during the first year of \nimplementation.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  the \nenvironmental  assessment  process  to  screen  specific  infrastructure  interventions  and  set  up \ninstitutional  arrangements  in  relation  to  environmental  management  and  monitoring.  Safeguard \nspecialists  and  trained  community  advisors,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  communities,  will \nconduct assessments in each project neighborhood in the process of preparing the NUAPs. 27 The \nNUAPs  will  record  results  of  the  environmental  screening  process.  For  the  NSD  under  output  3, \ninitial  environmental  examinations  will  be  prepared  at  each  site  after the  project  city  has formally \nconfirmed  its  readiness  to  participate  in  the  NSD  component  and  designated  the  land  for  the \nproject.  The  report  will  be  part  of  the  NSD  proposals  to  be  approved  by  DGHS  and  ADB.  NSD \nproposals without an initial environmental examination report will not be endorsed.  \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  negative  impacts  on \n28. \nindigenous  peoples.  It  will  not  discriminate  against  them  or  other  marginalized  groups.  Following \nCDD  principles,  the  project  will  include  opportunities  for  screening  project  impacts  on  indigenous \ngroups and incorporating mitigation measures, if any, into the consolidated city investment plans. \nIn accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified category C \nfor indigenous peoples.28  \n \n\n                                                 \n24  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n25  Community members will pay for land from their own resources; loan proceeds will not be used. \n26  Safeguard specialists will direct and supervise implementation of land acquisition by BKMs, and LCOs based on the \n\nresettlement framework, which has been disclosed (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n27  National and regional consultant teams will include environmental safeguard experts, who will guide communities and \nLCO  to  carry  out  environmental  screening  and  supervise  the  process.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework has been disclosed (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n28  Indigenous  people  and  other  vulnerable  groups  will  be  part  of  the  capacity-building,  planning,  implementation,  and \npost-implementation  processes;  minority  and  marginalized  groups  will  be  represented  on  BKMs;  and  indigenous \ngroups will benefit from easier access to service delivery, rural infrastructure, training, and construction-related jobs. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n29. \nOperation and maintenance. To ensure sustainability of infrastructure investments, DGHS \nwill  ensure  that  O&M  arrangements  are  well  reflected  in  the  NUAPs.  The  O&M  of  facilities \nupgraded  under  output 2  will  be  managed through  a community  participatory  approach,  involving \nthe local BKM and beneficiary communities. In the preparation of the NUAPs, consultant teams will \nguide  communities  and  LCOs  to  understand  the  need  for  O&M  provisions  and  ensure  that \nappropriate technical and financial measures for O&M are included. BKMs, supervised by the city \nadministrations, will handle O&M of new sites under output 3. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30. \nIn  the  past,  some  CDD  programs  have  bypassed  local  government  planning  procedures. \nThe project will mitigate this risk by facilitating a consultation process between BKMs and the city \nadministrations  to  jointly  formulate  consolidated  investment  plans  and  ensure  that  NUAPs  are \naligned  with  spatial  plans  and  development  strategies.  For  the  NSD,  a  potential  risk  involves \nsuccessfully  engaging  with  private  stakeholders  to  establish  new  housing  sites  for  poor  families. \nThis risk will be mitigated through targeted awareness campaigns to illustrate the mutual benefits \nfor  all  stakeholders.  Project  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  facilitate  dialog  among  developers, \nfinancial  institutions,  local  administrations,  and  community  members.  Previous  CDD  projects \nindicate  a  risk  of  \u201celite  capture\u201d\u2014where  wealthy  and/or  articulate,  educated  community  members \ndominate decision-making processes. This risk will be mitigated by (i) using transparent processes \nin  conducting  needs  assessments  and  preparing  NUAPs;  (ii)  working  through  BKMs  with  elected \nrepresentative  from  the  neighborhoods;  and  (iii)  publicly  displaying  decision-making  processes, \ntender  documents, fund transfers,  and  progress of  civil  works.  Experienced  consultant teams  will \nsupport  communities  in  preparing  technical  designs  and  implementing  civil  works  to  ensure  high \nquality  of  infrastructure  and  effective  O&M  arrangements.  DGHS  will  set  up  units  to  handle \ncomplaints at each project city that will review and address grievances from stakeholders.29  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all \n31. \napplicable ADB policies  including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration  manual  and  loan  documents.
