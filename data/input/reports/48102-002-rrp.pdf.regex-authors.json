THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Qinghai  Haidong  Urban\u2013Rural  Eco \nDevelopment Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will improve the ecological and environmental  services in Haidong City \nthrough more effective water resource and flood management, as well as ecosystem-based \nadaptation  in  the  Huangshui  River  watershed.  This  will  involve  the  improvement  of  flood \nmitigation embankments and practices, control of watershed soil erosion, the expansion of \nwater treatment and water supply to upstream rural communities and Haidong, as well as \nexpansion of the city\u2019s solid waste disposal capacity. This multidisciplinary approach to urban \nwatershed  management  will  play  a  critical  role  in  enhancing  environmental  protection, \necological rehabilitation, and climate change adaptation capacities in the river catchment area, \nthereby benefiting not only Haidong, but also many downstream communities. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Qinghai Province, situated mostly on the Qinghai\u2013Tibetan plateau in northwestern PRC, \nhas long been home to a number of ethnic groups due to its location along the old Silk Road.2 \nEthnically diverse and featuring a beautiful and rugged landscape with mountains and pastures, \nQinghai is the source of the Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers, making it a socially and \nenvironmentally significant province for the PRC.3 Given the fragile terrain, Qinghai is promoting \nurbanization within a northeastern corridor linking its capital, Xining, to Lanzhou,  in Gansu \nProvince. While protecting its natural resources, Qinghai also aims to protect urban areas from \nnatural hazards such as flash flooding, which has increased in cities across the PRC as a result \nof impermeable paved surfaces, deforestation, poor waterway management, and an overall \ndecrease in natural water collection areas. \n \n4.  Haidong, the second-largest city in Qinghai, is located within this corridor, immediately \neast of Xining. A city of 1.7 million residents (30.0% of Qinghai\u2019s total population of 5.7 million), \nHaidong  upgraded  to  a  prefecture-level  city  in  2013,  denoting  its  importance  in  regional \ndevelopment. Haidong has two districts\u2014Ping\u2019an and Ledu\u2014and four counties.4 Both districts \nstraddle the Huangshui River, an important tributary of the Yellow River. Strengthening the \necological function of the Huangshui River to protect these critical watersheds is an urgent \npriority. This involves managing flood risks, reducing soil erosion, improving water quality and \navailability, increasing climate change resilience, and limiting urban expansion.  \n \n5.  According to the Haidong master plan, the two districts are expected to add more than \nhalf  a  million  residents  by  2030.5 This  will  put  pressure  on  an  already  fragile  landscape; \n                                                \n1  The concept paper was approved on 19 December 2014. ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Qinghai Haidong Urban\u2013Rural Eco Development Project. Manila (TA 8846-PRC). \u201cEco \ndevelopment\u201d refers to ecological development. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Qinghai is home to 54 of the 56 ethnic groups in the PRC. It is also one of the less-developed western regions \ntargeted for accelerated socioeconomic development and poverty reduction by the preferential policies under the \nNational Strategy for Development of the West. \n3  Haidong\u2014located along the Silk Road near a number of significant Buddhist temples, Qinghai Lake, and the train \nlink to Lhasa\u2014attracts many tourists in summer, which generates significant revenue and local employment.  \n4  The current population of Ping\u2019an District is 68,100 while the current population of Ledu District is 109,800. \n5  Government of the PRC, Haidong Municipal Government. 2013. Master Planning of Haidong Urban Area (2013\u2013\n2030). Haidong.   ", "2   \n \nHaidong\u2019s location in the river valley, surrounded by steep and barren mountains, makes it \nvulnerable to flash flooding. According to Haidong\u2019s historical records, flood events of different \nlevels have occurred every year since 1949, with large-scale floods every 6\u20137 years. While \nsome flood infrastructure is in place, it is poorly maintained and unevenly distributed across \nurban and rural areas. Mountainside soil erosion exacerbates flooding risks, increasing the \nsediment loads and threatening agricultural land downstream.  \n \n6.  As  Haidong  continues  to  grow,  public  services  in  urban  and  rural  areas  remain \ninadequate; without upgrades, they will further fail to meet local water supply and solid waste \ndisposal needs. The steep terrain surrounding Haidong has led to the development of small \nvillages in the mountains, including minority villages, which will suffer socially and economically \nif public service investments remain unbalanced between rural and urban areas. \n \n7.  Strategic fit. The proposed project is closely aligned with both the PRC government\u2019s \npriorities and the country strategy and operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \nPRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014), \nand ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020, support strategic priorities, in the \nareas of urban and environmental management.6 Key thematic areas that coincide with the \nproposed project include (i) strengthening climate resilience; (ii) promoting sustainable use of \nland and natural resources; (iii) strengthening water security; and (iv) promoting integrated \nwater resource management, wetland protection, and afforestation. \n \n8.  Lessons and special features. The project design incorporates lessons from previous \nADB-financed projects and studies.7 These cover the need for (i) an integrated approach to river \nrehabilitation,  including  structural  and  nature-based  measures;  (ii)  strong  leadership  and \ngovernance in urban and environmental management;  and (iii) better coordinated decision-\nmaking on integrated water resource management. These lessons are reflected in several \ninnovative and special features: (i) preparatory in-depth provincial, local, and project-specific \nclimate risk and vulnerability assessments (CRVAs) to pinpoint and raise awareness of climate-\nrelated risks, and build ecosystem-friendly adaptation measures into the design of various \ninfrastructure  components;  (ii)  reuse  of  treated  urban  wastewater  for  mountainside  forest \nirrigation, which will showcase an integrated approach to managing both water scarcity and soil \nerosion;  (iii) use  of  nature-based  measures  for  the  temporary  storage  of  floodwaters;  and \n(iv) institutional strengthening to support better coordination and project implementation with \nregard to integrated water resource management.8 \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n9.  The  expected  impacts  will  be  enhanced  environmental  protection,  ecological \nrehabilitation, and climate change adaptation; and improved flood control standards and urban \naesthetics  along  the  Huangshui  River  (footnotes  5\u20136).   The  intended  outcome  will  be  an \nimprovement in ecological and environmental services in Haidong.  \n                                                \n6  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

The project will have four outputs: (i) integrated flood plain management infrastructure is \nprovided for Huangshui River; (ii) measures to control soil erosion in Haidong\u2019s urban catchment \nare implemented; (iii) rural\u2013urban water supply and solid waste infrastructure is constructed; \nand (iv) project management capacity is strengthened. \n \n11.  Output 1 will support the stabilization of riverbanks and improve integrated flood risk \nmanagement,  rehabilitate  riverine  wetlands,  increase  forest  coverage within  riparian  areas, \nprovide environmental education, and improve recreational opportunities for residents through \nthree components. First, the rehabilitation of existing and the addition of new embankments \nalong the main Huangshui River channel will stabilize the riverbanks, securing both agricultural \nand urban land. Based on the CRVA, climate-proofing measures were incorporated into the \nproject design; the embankment heights were increased to accommodate the projected average \nincrease in flood flows (8%). Second, the establishment of a riverside greenbelt, including new \nvegetation and pedestrian paths, will allow for public space and seasonal flood water storage, \nimproving  local  water  absorption  and  decreasing  downstream  flood  risks.  Third,  the \ndevelopment of an ecological wetland park will rehabilitate existing wetlands and allow seasonal \nflooding while educating the public on environmental issues.  \n \n12.  Output 2 will focus on controlling soil erosion to reduce siltation in Huangshui River, \npursue dust suppression, and set an urban growth boundary to protect the fragile mountainous \nlandscape adjacent to Ping\u2019an District\u2019s urban area. Recognizing the increasing local water \nscarcity (identified in the CRVA), treated urban wastewater from the existing Ping\u2019an wastewater \ntreatment plant will provide irrigation for the establishment of a mountainside forest. Output 2 \nwill have two components: (i) planting new vegetation to establish a mountainside greenbelt; \nand (ii) expanding the irrigation network to include approximately 663 hectares of existing \nmountainside greenbelt using treated wastewater. The irrigation of these afforested areas with \nreused water has minimal impact on existing water resources while decreasing soil erosion.  \n \n13.  Output 3 will focus on providing critical urban and rural services; it will contribute to \nreducing water insecurity for rural and urban areas in Ping\u2019an District, as well as improving solid \nwaste treatment capacity for Ledu District. Output 3 will have two components: (i) building three \nwater treatment plants and new conveyance pipe networks for raw and potable water; and \n(ii) adding  850,000  cubic  meters  of  capacity  to  the  Ledu  landfill  and  building  a  leachate \ntreatment  facility.  Based  on  the  CRVA,  climate-proofing  measures  include  providing  an \nalternative supply of drinking water to the Ping\u2019an urban area to reduce the water scarcity risk, \nand increasing drainage and leachate collection capacity at the landfill site. The provision of \nbasic services to urban and rural areas aims to reduce the rural-urban infrastructure gap. \n \n14.  Output 4 will support consulting services, training, and equipment to boost the capacity \nof the executing and implementing agencies  for (i) project implementation and operational \nmanagement, (ii) financial management, (iii) landfill operation and maintenance, (iv) wetland \nand forest operation and maintenance, (v) flood risk management, and (vi) nonrevenue water \nmanagement. The output will also contribute to institutional strengthening, promote cooperation \nand decision-making at the river basin level, and develop a water safety plan to mitigate water \ninsecurities in Haidong. A capacity development submodule was also included for climate-\nresilient urban development planning and regional water resource management. \n \n ", "4   \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  A comprehensive feasibility analysis of the engineering components was undertaken. \nThe engineering designs for the embankments, water supply, wastewater reuse, and landfill \nexpansion  are  suitable  for  local  circumstances,  topography,  and  climate;  consistent  with \nstrategic and sector priorities; and in line with PRC design guidelines and local regulations. A \n ", "6   \n \nCRVA was conducted confirming the project\u2019s medium climate risk categorization.10 Design \noptions  were  compared  before  selecting  the  best  possible  technologies  in  view  of  cost, \nenvironmental, and social impacts. Detailed baseline information collected from topographic \nsurvey  data,  geotechnical  field  data,  detailed  hydrological  analysis,  and  detailed  hydraulic \nanalysis was applied to the design and development of the flood mitigation component. The \nlandscape components (greenbelts and wetland park) incorporated lessons from international \nand national best practice, and took into account local climatic and hydrological conditions. The \ncapacity-building  components  were  based  on  a  needs  assessment  for  the  successful \nimplementation and operation of project facilities.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic  analysis.  This  was  prepared  for  the  overall  project  and  for  individual \ncomponents following ADB guidelines.11 Information available for the updated subcomponents \nwas verified to support design outcomes. The project components will have quantifiable and \nnonquantifiable benefits such as avoided flood damage, increased forest cover and landscaping \nto maintain the balance of soil and water resources, ecotourism and environmental education, \nimproved irrigation and avoided water scarcity, sustainable rural and urban water supplies, more \nefficient solid waste services and cleaner environment, and reduced health risks. The present \nvalue  of  the  economic  benefits  is  CNY1,100.7  million,  while  economic  costs  amount  to \nCNY1,019.3 million, resulting in a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 1.1. The economic internal rate of return \nfor the individual components is: output 1 at 12.1%; output 2 at 12.1%; and output 3 at 15.4% \nfor the water supply subcomponent and 23.8% for the solid waste subcomponent. For the \noverall project, the economic rate of return is 13.1%, with a net present value at CNY70.2 \nmillion. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the overall project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \ncould fall below 12.0% in the event of investment cost overruns, a decrease in benefits, and a 1-\nyear delay in project implementation. \n \n22.   The project will have nonquantifiable benefits such as a better microclimate, greater \nbiodiversity, and higher market value of affected land. Likewise, food for bird, fish, and wildlife \nspecies will be in abundance in the improved habitat, and will have significance in species \npropagation. The large-scale project construction works will provide jobs during implementation \nand thereafter. The project will promote ecotourism and achieve joint development of upstream \nand  downstream  industry  chains  that  foster  economic  growth  in  the  communities  and \nsurrounding areas.     \n \n23.  Financial analysis. The financial sustainability analysis for the project indicates that \nHMG,  receiving  regular  budget  transfers  to  cover  its  expenditures,  has  sufficient  funds  to \nfinance the counterpart contributions during project implementation and to pay debt service and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs during operation. Average annual counterpart funding \naccounts  for  3.3%  of  projected  revenues,  or  0.4%  of  the  expenditures  of  HMG  during \nimplementation.  Annual  debt  service  and  project O&M  costs  range from  0.8%  to  1.0% of \nprojected revenues during operations. Under the direction of the national Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan (footnote 6), requirements for local governments\u2019 counterpart funds will be reduced or \nwaived for poor areas in the country engaged in domestic investment projects. This will alleviate \n                                                \n10 Climate risks were assessed (i) at regional level to gauge the vulnerability of the integrated water management \nplan for the Huangshui River Basin; and (ii) at Haidong City level to evaluate the vulnerability of the designs of \nproposed project components and the water resource management elements of the Haidong City Master Plan. \n11 ADB.1999. Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila; ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, and Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Manila. \n ", "7 \nsome of the fiscal burden on local governments\u2019 domestic investment projects and divert more \nresources to foreign-funded projects such as this project. \n \n24.  Financial evaluation of the three water treatment plants indicates that full cost recovery \nis not possible at reasonable tariff assumptions, given the nature of low revenue collection for \nrural water supply and the relatively small scale of the plants. To achieve a financial internal rate \nof return of 3.5% for the water supply investment component (compared with the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 2.3%), the water tariff for urban areas should be raised from CNY1.8 \nper cubic meter to CNY4.9 per cubic meter. If water tariffs are maintained at current levels and \nabout 23.0% of the investment cost of this component is included, the financial internal rate of \nreturn may reach 3.5%. However, full recovery of O&M costs can be achieved from the overall \ntariff revenue generated. The operating margin (estimated based on current tariff levels and full \nO&M costs) is estimated at 21.6%. This component will generate a positive operating margin \neven with a 10.0% reduction in tariff revenues and a 5.0% increase in O&M costs. ADB\u2019s \ndecision to invest in this component is based on the benefits of bringing safe and adequate \nwater to rural populations as well as the government\u2019s commitment to maintain sound fiscal \ncapacity to absorb project costs. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  its  Accountability \nMechanism Policy (2012) were explained to and discussed with HMG. A procurement risk \nassessment of HMG and the project management office (PMO) confirmed that capacity is \nadequate with assistance of a procurement agency to prepare and arrange all procurement \nactivities according to the PRC\u2019s domestic rules; ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time); and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). The specific policy requirements and measures are described in the PAM. \n \n26.  A financial management assessment found that HMG and the implementing agencies\u2019 \nlack of knowledge of ADB financial management policies, lack of standardized procedures, and \ninadequate budget planning processes were the primary financial risks. Given the participation \nof Qinghai Provincial Government through Qinghai Finance Department, it is concluded that the \noverall pre-mitigation financial management risk of HMG and the implementing agencies is \nmoderate to substantial. To mitigate these risks, an action plan was agreed with the PMO. With \nthese  measures  and  domestic  supervision,  the  financial  management  arrangements  are \nadequate.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  regarding \nprocurement and financial management are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.   In  2015,  Haidong  had  a  poor  population  of  175,800  accounting  for  33.8%  of  the \nprovincial poor population. Ping\u2019an and Ledu districts are both key state-level counties for \ndevelopment-oriented poverty reduction. In 2014, Ping'an had 44 poor villages and 7,500 poor \npeople, and Ledu had 141 poor villages and 30,000 poor people. The poverty incidence of the \nproject area is 10.0%. \n \n28.  The  project  will  promote  the  sustainable  social  and  environmental  development  of \nHaidong\u2019s urban and rural areas. The project has a direct beneficiary population of 217,000 in \n180 villages of nine townships within the two districts, i.e., an urban population of 152,000 \n(70.1%) and a rural population of 65,000 (30.0%). The project has an indirect beneficiary \npopulation of 205,600, i.e., an urban population of 26,900 (13.1%) and a rural population of \n ", "8   \n \n178,700  (86.9%).  The  project  will  generate  135  skilled  and  404  unskilled  jobs  during \nconstruction  and  162  skilled  and  331  unskilled  jobs  during  operations.  The  PMO  and \nimplementing agencies provided assurance that the priority for employment will be vulnerable \ngroups such as women, the poor, and ethnic minorities. A social and gender action plan was \nprepared to ensure that the positive benefits of the project and programs will be conducted and \nsupported by output 4. These programs will particularly address the needs and risks for women \nand  children.  Social  and  gender  indicators  will  be  included  in  the  project  performance \nmanagement system and output 4 provides adequate consulting inputs on implementation and \nmonitoring.12 \n \n29.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. It will \nhave significant benefits for women because they are primarily responsible for water collection, \nsolid waste disposal, and related household activities. It will contribute to reducing the time and \neffort  spent  by  women  on  these  activities,  allowing  them  greater  participation  in  income-\ngenerating activities, leisure, or family entertainment. The social and gender action plan will help \nensure that (i) women\u2019s participation in the project is increased, including a target for at least \n30.0% employment for women; (ii) up to 50.0% of participants in gender-sensitive environmental \nawareness  and  education  programs  on  water  saving,  solid  waste  recycling,  and  forest \nmanagement are women; (iii) at least 30.0% of participants in capacity-building activities are \nwomen; and (iv) gender targets, indicators, and sex-disaggregated data for project monitoring \nand evaluation are adequate. International and national social development specialists with \ngender expertise will be provided under the capacity development output to ensure the effective \nimplementation of the social and gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination with an environmental \nmanagement plan was prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand disclosed on the ADB website.  The initial environmental examination incorporates findings \nof domestic environmental impact assessments and topical studies conducted under the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance.13 Construction  will  cause  no  loss  of  valuable  ecology  or \nphysical cultural resources. Construction dust, noise, erosion, and local disruption to traffic and \ncommunities will be temporary. The design of flood mitigation embankments will promote the \nreestablishment of riverside habitats. Downstream afflux effects of flood mitigation works will be \nminor and manageable. Strict reservoir operation planning will ensure drinking and irrigation \nwater security for the target rural communities as well as minimum environmental flows even in \ndry years. Landfill design, enforcement of buffer zone requirements, and operational control will \nminimize impacts on environment and communities. HMG will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  the  environmental  management  plan.  Environmental \nmanagement is supported by capacity development and institutional strengthening activities \nunder output 4. HMG conducted meaningful consultation with potentially affected people and \ncomplaints will be handled in accordance with the project\u2019s grievance redress mechanism. \n \n31.  Land acquisition and resettlement (category A). One resettlement plan was prepared \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project will need to acquire a total area of \n1,461 mu; 987 households and 3,535 people will suffer land acquisition impacts, distributed \nacross project components.14 The average annual income loss per household owing to land \n                                                \n12 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n13 Including a survey of wetland resources, biodiversity, and habitats along the Huangshui River within Haidong \nMunicipality; and a CRVA. \n14 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "9 \nacquisition is estimated to be 16%; all households losing land opted for cash compensation, as \nfarming is not the main source of income. Also, 744 mu of collective land will be leased for the \nPing\u2019an  urban  riverside greenbelt  component, affecting  736  households  and  2,721  people. \nAbout  106.8  mu  will  be  occupied  temporarily,  affecting  145  households  with  423  people. \nCompensation rates for land acquisition and leasing are at replacement cost and are adequate \nfor affected persons\u2019 livelihood restoration. Meetings with district officials and related agencies \nrevealed that about 80% of cultivated land to be leased is of poor quality and has low production \nvalue (less than CNY700 annually). Consultation results indicated that villagers prefer land \nleasing  to  acquisition  because  they  can  receive  CNY1,040  in  annual  compensation  while \nretaining land-use rights. Upon the expiration of the 5-year lease term, the lease will be renewed \nat  an  updated  compensation  rate  based  on  the  government\u2019s  published  land  values.  The \nleasing agreements will be signed between affected villages and/or affected persons and the \ndistrict forestry bureau.  \n \n32.  The resettlement plan was disclosed to the affected people and posted on the ADB \nwebsite in June 2016. During project implementation, HMG and the implementing agencies will \nestablish a proper grievance redress mechanism, allocate resettlement staff, and coordinate \nwith relevant government departments for land acquisition, leasing, and income restoration \nactivities. HMG has committed to provide adequate and timely budget for land acquisition, \nleasing, and resettlement costs; all compensation amounts and resettlement benefits to affected \npersons  will  be  distributed  prior  to  dispossession  of  land  or  livelihood.  HMG  and  the \nimplementing  agencies will  conduct  internal monitoring  and report  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities in project progress reports. HMG and the implementing agencies will also \nengage an external monitor for semiannual monitoring and evaluation of resettlement plan \nimplementation; these reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB.  \n \n33.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  four  counties  in  Haidong  are  minority \nautonomous counties; the local population includes 18 ethnic minorities. In 2014, Haidong had a \nminority population of 618,500, accounting for 44.3% of official city residents; among these, a \nHui population of 273,700 (19.0%), a Tibetan population of 132,400 (9.2%), and a Tu population \nof 115,000 (8.0%). Within the direct project areas, ethnic minorities comprise about 10.0% of the \npopulation. Of these, 10,054 Hui people  (4.6% of direct beneficiaries) and 4,192 Tibetans \n(1.9%), together with Menggu and Tu, will benefit from better access to public services and \nenjoy the improved living environment. While most of the minority populations in the direct \nproject  area  are  scattered  throughout  Ledu  and  Ping\u2019an  districts,  Shihuiyao  Xiang  County \ncontains three Tibetan villages with a concentrated total minority population of 370 that will \nbenefit from rural water supply.  \n \n34.  An ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) was prepared and focuses on measures to \nfacilitate  the  inclusion  of  ethnic minorities  in all  project  activities,  and  to  ensure that their \ncustoms and beliefs are respected throughout project implementation. Two key targets for the \nEMDP  are  for  15%  of  jobs  going  to  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities,  and  50%  of  those \nparticipating in the public awareness program are ethnic minorities. The EMDP was disclosed to \nethnic minorities in the areas targeted by the project. EMDP implementation and monitoring is \nsupported  under  output 4.  Monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements  for  the  ethnic  minority \nsafeguard are included in the PAM and the project agreement. \n \n ", "10   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The overall risk level is medium. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nOrganizational  and  financial\u2014lack  of  overall  Training has been, and will continue to be, provided to HPMO \ncapacity  to  manage  the  project  in  the  areas of  and the implementing agencies in (i) procurement, (ii) financial \ninteragency coordination, proper governance, and  management, (iii) and O&M.
