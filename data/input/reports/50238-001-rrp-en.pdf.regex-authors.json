THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nsecured debt financing of up to $50,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent) through nonconvertible \ndebentures (NCDs) to be issued by Northern Arc Capital Limited (NACL) for the Northern Arc \nCOVID-19 Livelihood Support Project in India. \n \n2.  NACL is a nonbank financial company (NBFC), which is a pioneer in the finance sector in \nIndia, first connecting microfinance institutions (MFIs) and now other NBFCs to mainstream \nfinanciers through a variety of products, such as partial risk guarantees for capital market \nissuances. NACL also lends directly to certain customer segments that have traditionally had \nlimited access to finance. The debt financing of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support \nNACL\u2019s  plan  to  restart  its  funding  and  guarantees,  which  came  to  a  standstill  during  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown, and will target individual micro borrowers; \nmicro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs);  and  home  loan  borrowers.  These \ncustomer segments have been particularly impacted by COVID-19. NACL will lend directly to \nthem and provide support to financiers lending to these segments by catalyzing private debt from \nbanks,  international  financial  institutions,  and  local  capital  markets.  As  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s \nintervention, NACL will implement measures under a gender action plan (GAP) to expand access \nto credit for women. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Constrained access to finance for individuals and micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises. About 190 million Indian adults still do not have a bank account despite account \nownership greatly increasing from 35% in 2011 to 80% in 2017.1 Less than 6.6% of borrowers \naccess credit through formal channels.2 In fiscal year (FY) 2017, India had an estimated 55.8 \nmillion (nonagricultural) MSMEs operating in the top-five industries: retail (46.0%), food products \nand  beverages  (6.0%),  apparel  (5.0%),  motor  vehicle  repair  (4.0%),  and  textiles  (3.0%).3 \nPredominantly unregistered, 94.9% of MSMEs were micro-, 4.9% small-, and 0.2% medium-sized \nenterprises.4 MSMEs accounted for about 31% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 45% of \nexports, and employed more than 124 million people. About 59.5% of MSMEs are in rural and \n40.5% in urban areas. The lack of adequate access to finance is a major obstacle to growth of \nMSMEs, with 84% self-financing or using informal finance sources and only 16% accessing credit \nfrom formal financial institutions. For women who own businesses, the issue is more acute, with \nmore than 90% of their finance requirements being met through informal sources. The reasons \ninclude limited awareness and understanding of financial products because of women\u2019s lack of \nfinancial education and unfamiliarity with formal banking institutions, lack of collateral to guarantee \ncredit, and difficulty in presenting their personal profiles and track records. Women also require \nsupport from male family members for loan applications and are subjected to other discriminatory \n \n1  Global Findex Database. 2017.

The number of unbanked people declined dramatically after the government launched the Pradhan \nMantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme, under which 404.1 million bank accounts were opened as of 26 August 2020. \n2  World Bank. Global Findex Database (accessed 26 July 2020). Of the people who borrowed money in the 12 months \nbefore the survey (survey carried out in 2017), 14% borrowed through a formal channel, 72% through family and \nfriends, and the rest via private money lenders. \n3  International Finance Corporation. 2018.

Washington, DC. \n4  Only 15% of MSMEs are registered as enterprises with district industry centers or the online Udyog Aadhaar system. \n ", "2 \npractices by loan officers.5 Access to long-term, larger loans, such as mortgages, are particularly \nproblematic.6 \n \n4.  Nonbank financial companies at the forefront of financial inclusion. As of the end of \nMarch 2020, 9,601 NBFCs were registered7 but only 278 were considered systemically important \nby the regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).8 State-owned banks, which have traditionally \ndominated the banking landscape, continue to focus on direct agriculture loans and collateral-\nbacked loans to MSMEs, allowing NBFCs to flourish, with their share of total credit rising sharply \nfrom 18% in FY2015 to 23% in FY2019. NBFCs have created a business niche in inclusive \nsectors, targeting lower-income segments, where banks have limited or negligible presence. \nNBFCs often rely on alternative credit lending models, such as assessing cash flows for informal \nbusinesses or relying on the social contract that exists in close-knit communities rather than \ntraditional collateral-backed lending models. NBFCs have reached underserved and unserved \ncustomers by establishing superior low-cost distribution models. Banks have also started relying \non NBFCs to support lower-income segments, lending to which qualifies as priority sector lending \n(PSL),9 by (i) purchasing portfolios originated by NBFCs through the securitization and direct \nassignment route,10 (ii) partnering with them through the business correspondent route,11 and \n(iii) entering into co-lending arrangements.12 The success of the NBFC business model can be \ngauged from the conversion, in 2016, of nine NBFCs into small finance banks (SFBs), a special \nbank category created by RBI to assist the underserved and unserved segments. Housing finance \ncompanies (HFCs) primarily target special customer segments (often outside urban areas), \nincluding affordable housing buyers and the self-employed, whom commercial banks do not \nserve. As of March 2020, HFCs accounted for 34% of the total mortgage loan market.13 \n \n5.  Constraints  in  raising  debt.  Access  to  medium-  and  long-term  finance  is  highly \nconstrained for NBFCs, especially small and medium-sized ones. Typically, the only formal \nsources of funding available to such NBFCs are domestic bank loans and, selectively, finance \nfrom multilateral development banks and development finance institutions for the larger, higher-\nrated NBFCs. Even then, the quantum of funding is often restricted because of the limited track \nrecord,  small  size,  and  lower  credit  ratings  of  many  NBFCs.  India\u2019s  bond  markets  have \n \n5  ADB. 2014. Gender Tool Kit: Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance and Development. Manila. \n6  India has low mortgage penetration (10.3%) and a shortage of housing units, last estimated at 18.7 million in urban \nand 43.7 million in rural areas. An estimated 90% of the shortage is in the affordable housing segment, primarily for \nthe economically weaker section and the low-income group. ICRA Research. 2020. Indian Mortgage Finance Market. \nAugust 2020. Delhi; Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation. 2017. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna. Delhi. \nAccording to the ministry, those in the economically weaker section have a family income of less than \u20b90.3 million \nper annum; in the low-income group, \u20b90.3 million\u2013\u20b90.6 million; and in the middle-income group, more than \u20b90.6 \nmillion and less than \u20b91.8 million. \n7  In this document, NBFCs include MFIs and housing finance companies (HFCs) unless specified. \n8  Those with total assets of more than \u20b95 billion. \n9  PSL is a requirement of RBI to support financial inclusion. As per current guidelines, commercial banks must lend at \nleast 40% of their adjusted net bank credit of the previous year to specified priority sectors such as agriculture, \nMSMEs, and export-oriented industries, focusing on rural borrowers. If a bank fails to achieve the PSL target, any \nshortfall needs to be deployed in funds, such as the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund run by the National Bank \nfor Agriculture and Rural Development, where the rates of interest are low and determined based on the extent of \nthe bank\u2019s PSL shortfall. RBI. Frequently Asked Questions.  \n10 Securitization allows a lender to pool certain assets and sell them to different investors. Please refer to a sample \nsecuritization structure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). As per estimates by ICRA \nResearch, a credit rating agency in India, the total volume of securitization and direct assignment increased to an \nestimated \u20b92.0 trillion in FY2020, nearly triple the \u20b9692.0 billion in FY2016. \n11 Business correspondents are essentially bank agents that extend services, such as opening accounts, mobilizing \ndeposits, accepting remittances, making remittance payouts, and originating loans on behalf of the bank. \n12 Customer origination, collection, and servicing are done by the NBFC while typically retaining 20% of a loan on its \nbalance sheet, with the balance booked by the partner bank. Co-lending is expected to increase. \n13 ICRA Research. 2020. Indian Mortgage Finance Market. August 2020. Delhi. \n ", "3 \ntraditionally catered to government entities and large top-rated corporates and thus have limited \ndepth. As a result, most small and medium-sized NBFCs do not access the bond markets, \nespecially for medium- and long-term paper. NBFCs that focus on financially inclusive sectors are \noften small, which limits their access to medium- and long-term bank funding and to debt capital \nmarkets. \n \n6.  Access to debt funding has been further constrained since the collapse, in September \n2018, of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IL&FS),14 a large and well-known \nNBFC, as well as certain other NBFCs. The mutual fund industry\u2019s exposure to NBFCs decreased \nsharply by 48% from July 2018 to July 2020.15 Banks bridged part of the gap, with lending to \nNBFCs as a percentage of total bank credit rising from 7.0% in October 2018 to 9.0% in June \n2020.16 The same was not adequate, however, to prevent a slowdown in credit growth in the \nNBFC sector, which saw its annual growth of 17.7% in FY2014\u2013FY2018 fall to an estimated \n11.3% in FY2018\u2013FY2020. By comparison, bank credit growth was 6.7% in FY2014\u2013FY2018 and \n12.0% in FY2018\u2013FY2020. \n \n7.  COVID-19 impact. The Government of India responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by \nimposing one of the most stringent lockdowns, starting 24 March 2020, before easing some \nrestrictions in May 2020 and easing them further in June 2020.17 The lockdowns halted business \noperations and mobility during April and May 2020, which not only impacted businesses but also \nresulted in increasing loss of livelihoods, primarily in the lower-income segment. As a result, \nIndia\u2019s GDP is expected to contract by 9.0% in FY2021.18 NBFCs and their customers have been \nheavily impacted by COVID-19. Most NBFC clients, who are largely in the informal segment, were \n(and, in certain locations, still are) affected by lockdowns. The effect of the pandemic and the \nresulting lockdowns was evident in the loan moratoriums availed by customers to conserve \nliquidity and tide them over during the shortfall of cash flows. As per NACL estimates, in April and \nMay 2020, NBFCs extended moratoriums to ~95% of micro borrowers, ~70% of MSMEs, and \n~35% of affordable housing customers. CRISIL estimates revenues for MSMEs to reduce by \n17%\u201321% and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins to decline \nby 30%\u201340% in FY2021.19 A slow recovery cycle because of extended or rolling lockdowns, \ncoupled  with  limited  credit  and  weakening  demand,  worsened  the  credit  profiles  of  these \ncustomers. NBFCs\u2019 ability to extend moratoriums allowed by RBI was compromised because they \ndid not get a moratorium from all their lenders thus adversely impacting the NBFCs\u2019 liquidity \nposition.20 The flow of fresh credit to the sector, especially to the lower-rated NBFCs, was curtailed \n \n14 IL&FS, a AAA-rated NBFC, defaulted on its payment obligations, driven by asset\u2013liability mismatches, with short-\nterm funding supporting the development of long-gestation infrastructure projects. The default caused a crisis of \nconfidence among capital market investors, leading to a liquidity crunch for NBFCs. Dewan Housing Finance \nCorporation, one of the largest HFCs in India, defaulted on its payments in June 2019. It had significant exposure to \nreal estate companies, which were in the middle of a prolonged slowdown and heavily dependent on short-term \ncommercial paper, which contributed to liquidity issues. In September 2019, Altico, an NBFC focused on real estate \nfinancing, defaulted because of large-ticket exposures to the troubled real estate developer segment and asset\u2013\nliability mismatches. \n15 Securities Exchange Board of India. 2020.

MSMEs Face Existential Crisis, Revenues to Fall a Fifth. Mumbai (15 June). \n20 RBI allowed banks and NBFCs to extend a moratorium to their clients for 3 months, from March to June 2020. During \nthis cycle, NBFCs, which are largely funded by banks and mostly non-deposit taking, received on average a \nmoratorium from 50% of their lenders (capital market investors were not covered by RBI\u2019s circular), while extending \nthe moratorium to a larger subset of their customers. RBI later extended the moratorium until the end of August 2020, \nafter which it allowed banks and NBFCs to offer a one-time restructuring of loans for businesses and/or individuals \nafflicted by the pandemic. \n ", "4 \ndespite some targeted government interventions.21 In its annual financial stability report of July \n2020, RBI expressed concern about the declining share of market funding for NBFCs, especially \nsmaller and medium-sized ones, which had not been supported by banks and the capital markets. \nRBI felt that this situation could accentuate the liquidity risk for the sector and the financial system. \nBecause of the expected slowdown in funding, the NBFC sector is expected to experience a 50%\u2013\n60% decline in disbursements and its first fall in assets under management (AUMs) in nearly 2 \ndecades, with negative growth of 1%\u20133% in FY2021. 22 \n \n8.  Lessons. The project draws on the experience of previous ADB loans to NBFCs and MFIs \nin India, as well as lessons from support to MSMEs during times of crisis.23 These lessons include \nthe following: (i) a timely and relevant response is needed (ADB supported the NBFC and MFI \nsector after demonetization in November 2016 and the IL&FS-linked challenges in September \n2018); (ii) local currency loans should be provided; and (iii) amortizing loans, which align with the \nclient\u2019s underlying cash flows, are preferable to bullet loan structures, to reduce asset\u2013liability \nmismatches and refinancing risk for the company. \n \n9.  Rationale. Underserved segments\u2019 access to finance, particularly during the pandemic, \nremains a problem. NACL, with its deep understanding of NBFCs and India\u2019s capital markets and \nstrong  originating  capabilities,  coupled  with  its  sound  risk  culture  and  innovative  product \ndevelopment capabilities, is a suitable candidate for ADB funding. NACL has been a partner in \nADB\u2019s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program since 2011.24 NACL is a pioneer \nin the capital markets, facilitating access to mainstream finance for MFIs through innovative risk-\nsharing structures. Initially, NACL facilitated financing to the microfinance segment as a strategy \nfor banks to meet PSL requirements. Over the years, however, NACL has expanded its support \nto other inclusive asset classes by offering MSME, vehicle, agriculture, and affordable housing \nfinancing,  among  others,  primarily  for  smaller  and  lower-rated  NBFCs.  NACL  also  started \nproviding direct loans to MSMEs and individuals for business purposes along with some personal \nloans. The direct loans are either originated by NACL (in the case of smaller corporates and \nmedium-sized enterprises) or through its NBFC partners, where NACL co-finances each exposure \nand thus takes the underlying credit risk  (in the case of micro and small enterprises and \nindividuals). More than 90% of total business volumes25 raised by NACL support the livelihood of \ncustomers, i.e., loans are for productive purposes. From its inception to the end of March 2020, \nNACL has raised funding of close to $12.0 billion to the inclusive finance sector. Given its \nsuccessful track record in limiting nonperforming loans (NPLs) in wholesale lending portfolios, \nNACL witnessed increased demand from other investors that did not have PSL requirements, \nsuch as impact funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign institutional investors. \n \n21 The Government of India has extended various measures to support NBFCs, including additional liquidity lines to \nbanks, through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Small Industries Development Bank \nof India; 20% first-loss guarantee for purchasing NBFC paper; guarantee cover to support onlending by banks and \nNBFCs to existing MSME customers, among others. \n22 RBI. 2020.

Manila: ADB. \n24 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Modalities for the \nMicrofinance Risk Participation Program in India. Manila. When the program was approved in December 2010, NACL \nwas not included since the program was focused on risk participation with a local lender. However, in May 2011, the \nprogram was amended to include the guarantee structure, given the compelling partnership potential of NACL.. \n25 Business volume refers to the total amount of debt capital and guarantees raised by NACL for its clients. NACL takes \na portion of this business volume exposure on its balance sheet, which is reflected in its AUMs. AUMs include all on-\nbalance assets and off\u2013balance sheet items with recourse to NACL. NACL earns an arranger fee on the business \nvolumes and earns net interest income on the AUMs.  \n ", "5 \n10.  ADB\u2019s funding is important to support much-needed access to long-term and stable debt \nfunding to NACL given COVID-19\u2019s impacts on the market and NBFCs\u2019 client base. NACL \nextended moratoriums to a large portion of its NBFC clients in April and May 2020 to allow them \nto cope with requests for moratoriums from their customers during the complete lockdown. As \nlockdowns started easing in June, moratorium requirements reduced, but still there were demand \nfor moratorium from significant number of clients. The moratoriums ended in August 2020. The \ntransaction will support plans of NACL to restart guarantee operations and disbursements to its \nclients. The support will address a key concern of smaller NBFCs, which is access to fresh credit, \nand allow them to lend to their customers in highly affected segments such as microfinance and \nMSME financing. Given NACL\u2019s business model, the transaction is expected to catalyze domestic \nand foreign capital financing for these inclusive segments. \n \n11.  NACL is well placed to mitigate some of COVID-19\u2019s impacts despite a large share of its \nportfolio being affected by the pandemic. The company has a strong capital adequacy ratio, which \nis expected to absorb possible increases in credit costs as per stress tests conducted by ADB. \nSimilarly, the company has maintained good liquidity buffers. Fresh debt funding from ADB will \nallow NACL to further boost its liquidity profile and allow it to increase disbursements to and \nguarantees for its clients, helping them recover faster. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n12.  Overview. NACL was established as IFMR Capital Limited in 2008 by Dvara Trust \n(erstwhile IFMR Trust), a not-for-profit foundation focused on financial inclusion. NACL was \nfounded to connect high-quality NBFCs with potential investors for debt fundraising, to enable \nthem to deepen their presence and improve the access of millions of financially excluded \nhouseholds in India to financial services. NACL has become a market-leading debt platform for \nNBFCs with a presence in 680 districts in 29 states and 5 union territories through its 242 partner \noriginators,  serving  more  than  33  million  underlying  borrowers  as  of  FY2020.  NACL  has \ndeveloped its expertise across sectors and a variety of products over the years. NACL acts as an \nintermediary between originators, which cater to financially excluded households and enterprises \nacross the country, and debt capital market investors by providing direct loans and by undertaking \nstructured transactions where NACL subscribes to a junior tranche (higher risk)26 or takes a \nsecond loss position in transactions that it originates for its clients. Such a structure often \nstrengthens the credit rating of the senior tranche, thus attracting mainstream financial investors. \nThe company, in effect, is a wholesale lender and provides debt financing to NBFCs through a \ncombination of its own balance sheet lending, syndications, securitizations, and guarantees. The \nbusiness volumes managed by NACL include all the fund raising it has arranged for its clients, \nwhile NACL\u2019s balance sheet exposure forms part of its  assets under management. NACL \nmanages an alternate investment fund investing in structured debt issued by financial service \ncompanies through its 100% subsidiary, Northern Arc Investment Managers.  \n \n13.  Business strategy. NACL plans to continue using its strong risk management capability \nto retain its core focus as a debt platform for NBFCs. The company also plans to make its \nexposures  more  granular  by  expanding  its  partnership  model  for  supporting  MSMEs  and \nconsumer lending businesses, while moving into new sectors such as gold loans. The total direct \norigination portfolio, through co-lending with partner financial institutions, including the MSME \nsegment, is expected to grow faster than the rest of the business and increase its contribution. \nThe company has established strong technology infrastructure to monitor and integrate the direct \nlending portfolio with its partner originators.  \n \n26 The senior tranche has preference in cash flows over a junior tranche, thus improving the credit rating of the structure. \nSecuritization Structure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n14.  Ownership.27 ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence  on  NACL,  its  managers  and \nshareholders,  and  their  fund  managers  and  shareholders. 28  NACL\u2019s  shareholders  are \npredominantly institutional investors, private equity funds, trusts, and a foundation.  \n \n15.  Corporate governance. NACL\u2019s board of directors is responsible for providing strategic \ndirection,  setting  policies,  supervising  the  company\u2019s  performance,  and  ensuring  NACL\u2019s \ncompliance with laws and regulations. NACL has a strong board with eminent and reputable \nmembers, each with decades of experience in financial services. In accordance with applicable \nregulatory guidelines, 36% of the board is represented by four independent board members. The \nother seven members include nominee directors of the shareholders and the managing director \nand chief executive officer of the company. The board has various committees, including for audit, \nremuneration, corporate social responsibility, and risk, which govern NACL\u2019s functions. \n \n16.  Management.  Kshama  Fernandes,  a  risk  professional  with  more  than  20  years  of \nexperience in financial services, consulting, and academia, heads a team of 227 people. She was \npreviously the chief risk officer of NACL. She is supported by Nandita Ganapathy, chief financial \nofficer, with more than 20 years of experience; Bama Balakrishnan, chief operating officer, with \nmore than 20 years of experience; and Pardhasaradhi Rallabandi, chief risk officer, with more \nthan 20 years of experience in organizations such as Standard Chartered and IDBI Bank. \n \n17.  Risk management. NACL has a strong risk culture as can be seen from its near-zero \ndelinquency track record in its direct wholesale lending portfolio. NACL follows an integrated risk \nmanagement approach to evaluate the complete credit cycle, from onboarding to monitoring, \nmaking extensive use of analytics and modeling to measure macro-, sector-, and company-\nspecific trends. Any new segment undergoes 12\u201318 months of evaluation with two or three clients, \nwith  the  board  having  final  responsibility  for  approving  the  onboarding.  The  board\u2019s  risk \nmanagement committee meets every quarter to review the portfolio, sets exposure limits for each \nclient, and is responsible for setting policy. The chief risk officer directly reports to the committee. \nAs a response to various crisis impacting the NBFC sector, NACL adopted stricter changes in its \nexposure limits and governance monitoring of portfolio entities. \n \nD.

ADB will provide a senior secured debt financing of up to $50 million (in rupee equivalent) \nto NACL at a tenor of up to 5 years by subscribing to NCDs.29  \n   \n \n27 For details on ownership, board of directors, senior management, and risk management, please refer to Ownership, \nManagement, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank's Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila; and Integrity Due Diligence Disclosure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n29 An NCD is a form of fixed-maturity debt security regulated by RBI and SEBI. Upon issuance, the NCD will be listed \non the Bombay Stock Exchange or National Stock Exchange. If a regulatory change makes it unfeasible to structure \nthe financing as an NCD issuance, ADB may provide a bilateral loan to NACL on substantially the same terms. \n ", "7 \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Use of proceeds. NACL will use the proceeds of the ADB financing to fund or provide \nguarantees to its NBFC and SFB clients, microfinance borrowers, and MSMEs. A small part of \nADB\u2019s proceeds will be used to provide housing loans to the economically weaker section and \nlow-income group. \n \n20.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration.30 NACL \nwill submit to ADB (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual audited financial \nstatements, (iii) quarterly loan portfolio and covenant reports, (iv) annual development indicators \nagreed  between  ADB  and  NACL,  (v)  annual  reports  on  safeguards  and  social  protection \ncompliance, and (vi) annual progress reports on the GAP implementation. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  Supporting livelihoods. The transaction will support NACL\u2019s funding and guarantee \nactivities for the inclusive finance sector,31 thus facilitating the flow of credit to MSMEs and \nmicrofinance borrowers adversely affected by COVID-19 and allowing them to restart their \noperations. Crucially, the transaction will catalyze funding to the sector from private investors. \nNACL\u2019s typical ratio of business volume to on\u2013balance sheet exposure is five times (i.e., NACL \nenables a significantly higher amount of credit flow for its clients for every dollar it provides \ndirectly). The funding from ADB to NACL is likely to give a positive signal to other lenders and, \nthus, catalyze additional funding for the company. \n \n22.  Providing access to longer tenor funding. By providing long-tenor financing, ADB will \nhelp NACL support longer-tenor asset classes such as affordable housing and MSME loans. More \nimportantly, ADB will provide a source of stable long-term funding, which is especially difficult to \nraise given market events since September 2018. ADB funding will allow NACL to offer longer-\ntenor financing to its NBFC and SFB clients, which is not readily available through India\u2019s bond \nmarkets, especially after the onset of COVID-19. \n \n23.  Helping develop capital markets. The transaction will support the issuance of debt \ncapital by small and medium-sized NBFCs by aiding the overall growth of NACL\u2019s operations. \nNACL has diversified the investor base for its inclusive finance clients, which has helped broaden \ncapital markets. ADB\u2019s support will help NACL continue expanding its innovative products and \nstructures, thereby crowding in private capital for the growth of the inclusive finance space. \n \n24.  Promoting  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  intervention,  the  gender \nmeasures for NACL include developing and using a gender equality scorecard to evaluate the \ngender equality actions of new institutional clients, the outputs of which may be used for an annual \nworkshop  with  institutional  clients  to  increase  gender  equality.  The  GAP  includes  NACL \nincreasing the proportion of loans of its MSME financiers that go to women borrowers or co-\nborrowers. \n   \n \n30 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 NACL may be required to put up cash collateral, which can be funded from ADB\u2019s proceeds, to provide guarantee \nsupport to its clients.  \n ", "8 \nD.

The project is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s COVID-19 Response \nStimulus Package to bank and nonbank financial institutions.32 \n \n26.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: NACL\u2019s support to financially \ninclusive institutions and MSMEs in India increased.33 \n \n27.  Outputs. The outputs will be to expand NACL\u2019s funding capacity for lending to and \nfacilitating financing for financially inclusive institutions in India; and enhance gender equality \nwithin NACL and for its clients. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n28.  The  project  will  contribute to  the following  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030:34 \n(i) tackling remaining poverty and reducing inequalities and (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality.  According  to  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022,  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign operations will continue to support the development of the finance sector.35 The \nproposed transaction will support the development of MSMEs, increasing financial inclusion and \naiding  affordable  housing  finance,  which  are  key  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and \nstrengthening the COVID-19 pandemic response.36 The project is consistent with the Strategy for \nNew India @ 75, the Government of India\u2019s defined objectives for FY2023, which indicates \nfinancial inclusion, Housing for All, and employment as drivers of economic growth.37 The project \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u2013\n2020.38 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  ADB has categorized the debt investment as category FI (treated as C) for environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). \n \n \n32 On 16 May 2020, the Government of India announced an economic stimulus package of \u20b920 trillion (about 10% of \nGDP) under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Scheme), which includes \u20b93 trillion support to \nbusinesses, including MSMEs; a \u20b9300 billion special liquidity facility for NBFCs, HFCs, and MFIs.

NACL\u2019s business activities have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and are \nunlikely to affect involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The potential environmental \nand social effects and associated risks of the debt investment, and NACL\u2019s commitment and \ncapacity for environmental and social management were assessed. NACL has an environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) policy and a responsible-investment code, which are applied to all \nNACL investments. During due diligence, ADB identified the following actions to strengthen \nNACL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement requirements: (i) adopt ADB's prohibited investment activities list in NACL\u2019s ESG \npolicy; (ii) screen subprojects, and if they are in category A and category B for the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, make them ineligible to use ADB proceeds; \n(iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nabide by applicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy; (iv) take measures to comply with international core labor standards; and (v) \nadopt these changes as a supplementary environmental and social plan of the ESG policy before \ndisbursement of funds.39 NACL will submit periodic reports to ADB to confirm the environmental \nand social impacts of ADB-funded NBFCs and MSMEs and their compliance with local and \nnational environmental, health and safety, and labor regulations and standards (footnote 41). The \nclimate change impact from the project is expected to be low because of the nature and scale of \nloans that may be financed by the ADB loan proceeds. \n \n31.  Effective gender mainstreaming. In 2016, 90% of women entrepreneurs surveyed had \nnot availed themselves of finance from formal institutional channels, and an estimated 70% or \n\u20b91.4 trillion of financing demand remained unmet.40 Nearly 3 million MSMEs are fully or partially \nowned by women, and about 78% are in services, which have been particularly hard hit by the \nCOVID-19 crisis.41 NACL is a pioneer in enabling finance to NBFCs that lend predominantly to \nwomen. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), NACL will commit to \nincorporate measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business \nactivities. Confidential information deleted. NACL will submit periodic reports on implementation \nof gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n32.  NACL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment documentation includes provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the \nfinancing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
