The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Support for Improving Public Expenditure Quality Program, and if \nthe  Board  approves  the  proposed  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  program  supports  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  improve  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure and service delivery to lift living standards and reduce poverty, and represents a \nmedium-  to  long-term  partnership  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \ngovernment.  The  government\u2019s  priority  areas  to  improve  service  delivery  include  (i)  efficiently \nallocating  public  financial  resources;  (ii)  strengthening  the  identification  and  management  of \nfiscal risks; and (iii) improving the monitoring, evaluation, and oversight of budget expenditure. \nThe program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Viet Nam2 and \nis included in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Viet Nam.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  development  problem.  Sustained  high  economic  growth,  averaging  6.5%  during \n2005\u20132015, has supported one of the highest levels of public expenditure on infrastructure and \nservices in Southeast Asia. For example, Viet Nam spent an average of 11% of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  per  year  on  public  infrastructure  during  2010\u20132015  and  plans  to  spend  $20.2 \nbillion  on  infrastructure  in  2016,  a  50%  increase  in  real  terms  since  2014.  Similarly,  the \ncombined nominal recurrent expenditure on health and education grew 98% during 2011\u20132015, \nincreasing  its  share  of  the  total  state  budget  from  18%  to  24%.  Yet  higher  government \nexpenditure  has  not  always  been  directly  associated  with  improved  outcomes.  Despite  nearly \nhalf of the state budget capital expenditure being allocated to infrastructure during 2011\u20132015, \nViet  Nam  ranked  85th  out  of  138  countries  in  the  2016  Global  Competitiveness  Index  for  the \nquality of its infrastructure, well behind its regional competitors (Figure 1). Similarly, results from \na Public Administration Performance Index survey revealed that in 2015, user satisfaction with \npublic hospitals had fallen to their lowest level since the survey began in 2011.4 \n \n4. \nThe  disconnect  between  high  levels  of  investment  and  the  quality  of  infrastructure  and \npublic services highlights the government\u2019s challenges in efficiently allocating and implementing \nscarce  budgetary  resources  due  to  weaknesses  in  public  expenditure  and  fiscal  management \n(PEFM)  systems. 5  For  instance,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  incremental  capital\u2013output  ratio,  a  common \nmeasure  of  investment  efficiency,  was  5.2  in  2014,  meaning  that  $5.20  spent  on  investment \nproduces  only  $1  of  income  (Figure  2).  The  incremental  capital-output  ratio  in  neighboring \ncountries  is  3\u20134.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  inefficient  investment  erodes  economic  growth  and  undercuts \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2016.

With  Viet  Nam\u2019s  fiscal  space  declining  and  public  debt  levels \napproaching  their  legislated  limit  of  65%  of  GDP,  enhancing  PEFM  will  be  vital  for  improving \ninfrastructure and service delivery and sustaining long-term poverty reduction. \n \n\n \nFigure 1: Infrastructure Quality Ranking \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Incremental Capital\u2013Output \nRatio, 2014 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNote: Higher values indicate lower productivity. \nSource:  World  Bank.  2016.

Geneva  \n \n5. \nBinding  constraints.  Sound  PEFM  can  be  defined  as  a  system  through  which  public \nfinancial resources are planned, directed, and controlled to enable the efficient (cost per unit of \noutput)  and  effective  (benefits  relative  to  costs)  delivery  of  public  service  goals.  Recent \ndiagnostics  highlight  four  binding  constraints  to  effective  PEFM  in  Viet  Nam. 6  These  are  \n(i) inefficient public resource allocation, including a lack of longer-term expenditure planning and \nconsideration  of  costs  associated  with  maintaining  public  assets;  (ii)  poor  identification  and \nmanagement of fiscal risks, which lead to unplanned fiscal costs and challenges in tracking and \nmitigating  risks;  (iii)  weak  oversight  and  evaluation  of  expenditure,  which  erode  accountability \nfor results; and (iv) inadequate domestic resource mobilization, which limits funds available for \npublic expenditure (footnote 6). These constraints are discussed in in paras. 6\u20139.  \n \n6. \nInefficient  public resource  allocation. While the Ministry of Finance (MOF) continues \nto  strengthen  its  PEFM  system,  weaknesses  remain  in  budget  planning  and  execution.  First, \nthere  is  no  medium-term  expenditure  framework  so  budgets  are  developed  and  approved  to \ncover 1 year at a time. As a result,  multiyear projects are often started without any assurance \nthat funds will be available to complete them. This hampers strategic investment planning and \nlimits  advance  project  preparation.  Second,  there  are  more  than  30  off-budget  funds,  each \nestablished  under  a  different  law  and  government  decision.  While  off-budget  expenditure  is \napproved by the National Assembly, under the supervision of the MOF, there is no consolidated \nreporting  on  how  the  funds  are  used  and  expenditure  is  not  coordinated  with  national \ninvestment  planning. In addition,  limited  information  on government  assets makes  it  difficult to \nmanage assets and allocate budget for maintenance expenditure, which undermines the quality \nof public infrastructure investment. While the government has introduced the concept of gender-\nresponsive budgeting into the national budget, the extent to which this is translated into better \nplanning  and  resource  allocation  has  been  limited.  Gender  analysis  is  rarely  a  part  of  policy \nanalysis, and there is a lack of sex-disaggregated data and evidence-based research to guide \n\n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam. 2013. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment. Ha Noi. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fplanning decisions. As a result, consideration of how public expenditure impacts gender has not \nbeen mainstreamed into the budget process.7 \n \n7. \nPoor  identification  and  management  of  fiscal  risks. There are significant deviations \nbetween  approved  budgets  and  expenditure  outturns  arising  from  limitations  in  fiscal  risk \nmanagement.  Capital  expenditure  exceeded  budget  plans  by  an  average  of  29.2%  during \n2011\u20132015,  while  recurrent  spending  on  health  fell  below  budget  targets  by  an  average  of \n13.3% during the same period. Further, limited controls over the use of government guarantees \nsignificantly erode budget reliability. Government guarantees accounted for over 18.0% of public \ndebt, or 11.4% of GDP, at the end of 2015. State policy banks are a major user of government \nguarantees, but a lack of information on these banks\u2019 financial status makes it difficult to assess \nhow this risk affects public debt management.8 Projects guaranteed by the government are risky, \nparticularly  those  issued  to  state  enterprises  with  opaque  balance  sheets  and  untested  debt \nservice  capacity.  Nevertheless,  guarantees  are  often  issued  without  any  charge  to  the \nborrowing  entity.  Finally,  Viet  Nam  has  progressively  devolved  fiscal  responsibilities  so  that \nmore  than  half  of  the  state  budget  is  now  spent  by  subnational  governments.  Yet  most \nprovinces  continue  to  rely  on  central  government  transfers  and  have  limited  accountability  for \nrepaying  debt  mobilized  by  the  central  government  on  their  behalf,  including  official \ndevelopment  assistance  (ODA).  Combined  with  unclear  responsibilities  over  the  provision  of \ncounterpart funding, this limits incentives for well-disciplined and accountable fund utilization. \n \n8. \nWeak  oversight  and  evaluation  of  expenditures.  The  government\u2019s  public \nexpenditure  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  require  strengthening  to  lift  spending  quality. \nFormal appraisal mechanisms are often not independent, with responsible agencies subordinate \nto  authorities  who  are  the  ultimate  project  owners.  The  National  Assembly  is  often  given \ninsufficient  time  to  thoroughly  review  budget  proposals.  Reporting  standards  for  evaluating \npublic  investment  projects  are  not  consistent,  and  information  systems  to  monitor  progress \nagainst targets are underdeveloped. Due to current resource limitations, the State Audit Office \nof  Vietnam  (SAV)  can  only  audit  50%\u201360%  of  government  reporting  units.  Moreover,  audit \nresults  are  not  consistently  released  publicly,  particularly  for  enterprises  with  large  state \nholdings.  Ongoing  decentralization  of  project  appraisal  also  presents  challenges.  Provincial \ngovernments, despite being in a better position to judge the success of a project, often lack the \nhuman capacity and systems to effectively undertake review and reporting functions. \n \n9. \nInadequate  domestic  resource  mobilization.  Weaknesses  in  mobilizing  domestic \nresources  are  creating  pressures  for  fiscal  consolidation.  While  Viet  Nam\u2019s  tax  administration \nperforms well compared with its peers, there has been a significant downward trend in revenue \nas a share of GDP since 2010.9 Viet Nam has reduced its tax base with tax and tariff reductions, \nexemptions  for  favored  firms,  and  incentives  to  encourage  new  foreign  direct  investment. \nReversing the decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio will be vital to stem a build-up in public debt \nand  restore  fiscal  policy  to  a  more  sustainable  path. 10 To  address  this,  significant  new  tax \nmeasures will be required.  Administrative measures will also be needed to reduce tax evasion \nand arrears, disclose incidents of tax fraud, and streamline value-added tax refund procedures. \n\n                                                \n7  United  Nations  Entity  for  Gender  Equality  and  the  Empowerment  of  Women  (UN  Women).  2015.

The government\u2019s Finance \nDevelopment  Strategy  (FDS),  2011\u20132020  and  its  rolling  3-year  medium-term  action  plan,  \n2015\u20132017 lay out a comprehensive reform plan to improve the impact of public expenditure on \npoverty reduction and sustainable growth.11 The FDS aims to reduce financial waste, enhance \nthe  accountability  and \ntransparency  of  budget  operations,  and  empower  subnational \ngovernments  to  provide  services  more  directly  to  the  public.  In  line  with  the  FDS,  the \ngovernment has approved PEFM reforms, including passing the Public Investment Law in 2014 \nand  the  State  Budget  Law  in  2015.  However,  the  government  now  faces  significant \nimplementation challenges because numerous decrees are needed to clarify how the principles \nof the laws will be implemented. Significant capacity development is required to ensure officials \ncan implement enhanced PEFM requirements. While reforms are focused on PEFM processes, \nthey are expected to catalyze incremental institutional reforms over the medium-term. To ensure \nreforms are sustainable, support for these planned institutional changes is needed.12 \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  experience.  The  program  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  long  engagement  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nPEFM reform through policy dialogue, loan programs, TA, and knowledge support (Figure 3).13 \nIn 2008,  ADB  began  supporting  civil  service reform,  developing  a standardized  system for job \nanalysis,  job  descriptions,  and  qualification  standards  in  government  agencies.  Following  this, \nADB supported the preparation of the government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2015  and  followed  this  up  with  capacity  building  and  TA  activities  aimed  at  (i)  enhancing  the \nefficiency  of  externally  financed  public  investments,  (ii)  further  improving  civil  service  capacity \nand  performance  management,  and  (iii)  strengthening  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  and \ntheir  links  to  national  strategies.  During  this  time,  ADB  also  supported  revisions  to  the \nProcurement Law, and related reforms that regulate investment through private sector models. \nSince 2014 ADB has stepped up its support for PEFM in Viet Nam, providing targeted support \nto the government for enhancing public asset management systems, strengthening public debt \nmanagement,  reducing  risks  associated  with  government  guarantees,  and  working  across \ncentral agencies and the National Assembly to strengthen oversight of budget implementation. \n \n12. \nLessons  and  program  synergies.  ADB\u2019s  past  engagement  has  demonstrated  that \naddressing  Viet  Nam\u2019s  PEFM  weaknesses  will  require  a  sequential  long-term  approach. \nRequests for support have often been dealt with in an ad hoc manner, leading to a wide array of \nactivities  with  few  synergies  between  them.  The  program  will  address  this  by  developing  a \nsequenced long-term plan for policy reform and institutional change addressing expenditure and \ninvestment quality. This approach  will facilitate  ADB\u2019s  deep  engagement  in policy  reforms  and \ngenerate synergies for ADB operations, particularly infrastructure, with direct links to road, rail, \nand  metro  asset  management  systems  as  well  as  to  secondary  education  reform.  The \nprogram\u2019s  support  for  enhanced  public  debt  and  ODA  management  and  strengthened  project \nevaluation  will  create  synergies  across  ADB\u2019s  portfolio.  The  program  will  also  complement \noperations  in  state-owned  enterprise  reform  and  the  financial  sector.  For  instance,  reforms  to \nstrengthen subnational capital mobilization will allow more direct lending from commercial banks \nto  provincial  governments,  contributing  to  financial  sector  deepening.  Likewise,  reforms  will \nsupport  ADB  efforts  to  commercialize  state-owned  enterprises  by  tightening  controls  over  the \nissuance  of  government  guarantees  to  these  entities,  and  strengthening  their  audit  standards \n(footnote 2). \n                                                \n11 Decision No. 450/QD-TTg of 18 April 2012 of the Prime Minister approving the Financial Strategy until 2020, and \nDecision No. 224/QD-BTC of 30 January 2013 of the Ministry of Finance approving the Action Plan of the Financial \nSector to Implement the Finance Development Strategy until 2020.

ADB  provided \n13. \ntechnical support for the preparation of the government\u2019s first 5-year public debt and borrowing \nplan  and  supported the introduction of new procedures to more comprehensively register public \ndebts  and  liabilities  for  national  and  subnational  governments.  ADB  also  conducted  a  risk \nassessment of provincial government debt mobilization through commercial banks to guide the \nimplementation of the revised State Budget Law. TA was provided to support the development \nof  a  risk management  system for  government guarantees  and to  tighten their  use. In  addition, \nADB  supported  the  development  of  life  cycle  management  systems  for  rail  and  metro  assets, \nand established  improved public  asset management  information systems.  Finally,  ADB  helped \ncomplete a National Assembly user guide for the State Budget Law, to enhance scrutiny of the \nstate  budget,  prepared  a  manual  to  govern  the  financial  management  of  ODA  projects,  and \ntrained 250 government officials to support its implementation. \n \n14. \nDevelopment partner coordination. The program was developed in close collaboration \nwith other development partners and led to the establishment of a development partner PEFM \nworking group in 2015 to ensure support is provided in a coordinated manner.14 Understanding \nthe  urgent  need  to  reverse  the  decline  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  revenue-to-GDP  ratio,  various \ndevelopment  partners  (European  Union,  International  Monetary  Fund,  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  World  Bank)  have  been  supporting  the  government  in  taxation  reform, \nwhich consequently will not form part of the program. ADB\u2019s added value through the program \nwill  be  maximized  by  its  deep,  long-term  engagement  on  issues  related  to  expenditure  and \ninvestment quality, particularly those that have strong synergies with ADB operations (para. 12). \nADB  will  also  actively  foster  new  partnerships  to  leverage  expertise,  such  as  with  the  United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  (UN Women) to assist in \noperationalizing a gender-responsive budgeting action plan for the transport sector.15 \n \n                                                \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 This  partnership  will  directly  assist  Viet  Nam  in  achieving  Sustainable  Development  Goal  5.c.1  \u201cProportion  of \ncountries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment.\u201d Inter-\nAgency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators. 2016.

A programmatic approach through \n15. \npolicy-based  loans  was  chosen  because  it  is  most  effective  in:  (i)  enabling  ADB  to  provide \nmedium-term support for the implementation of policies necessary to achieve FDS, 2011\u20132020 \ntargets; (ii) leveraging PEFM reforms to make nation-wide improvements to the quality of public \nexpenditure;  and  (iii)  contributing  to  filling  the  gap  in  government\u2019s  financing  to  meet  funding \nneeds  in  education,  health,  social  protection  and  infrastructure.  Subprogram  1  will  focus  on \nnational  legislative  and  regulatory  upgrades  in  PEFM,  while  subprogram  2  will  center  on  the \nimplementation of legislation introduced under subprogram 1. This approach uses policy-based \nlending  and  extensive  policy  dialogue  to  address  the  long-term  horizon  required  for  PEFM \nupgrades  and  to  ensure  reforms  are  properly  sequenced.  To  further  deepen  reforms,  a  third \nsubprogram may be considered subject to the successful implementation of subprograms 1 and \n2. It is envisioned that subprogram 3 would deepen  the program\u2019s impact by addressing fiscal \ndecentralization  issues  in  more  detail,  building  on  the  more  disciplined  provincial  borrowing \nrules and tighter subnational expenditure controls introduced under subprograms 1 and 2. \n \n16. \nEconomic impact of the program. The program is expected to enhance the quality of \npublic  expenditure.  Potential  economic  gains  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  improving  project  quality \nthrough  stronger  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  implementing  more  proficient  investment \nplanning, budget management, and life cycle asset management; and (iii) strengthening control \nover and reducing government-guaranteed loans (para. 29). \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe  impact  will  be  the  improved  provision  of  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  to  lift \nliving  standards  and  reduce  poverty.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  public  financial \nmanagement  systems.  The  program  is  structured  around  three  policy  outputs:  (i)  a  more \nproductive  allocation  of  public  resources,  (ii)  strengthened  identification  and  management  of \nfiscal  risks,  and  (iii) \nimproved  oversight  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  budget \nimplementation.16 Subprogram 1 has 14 policy actions, which the government completed during \nNovember  2014\u2013September  2016.  Subprogram  2  contains  14  policy  actions,  of  which  10  are \nprior expected actions (triggers). \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nof \n\nthe \n\nintroduction \n\n18. \nOutput  1:  Public  financial  resources  more  productively  allocated.  This  output  will \nstrengthen systems that guide the allocation and disbursement of public funds and improve the \nmanagement of assets created by this expenditure. Achievements included under subprogram 1 \ninclude \nand  \n5-year  medium-term \n5-year public investment plans that allow for more strategic and disciplined expenditure planning. \nBy  requiring  additional  public  revenues  and  expenditures  to  be  recorded  in  annual  budget \ndocumentation, wasteful off-budget spending will be reduced. Subprogram 1 also supported the \nintroduction  of  gender-responsive  and  performance-based  budgeting  as  principles  of  state \nbudget  management.  To  ensure  that  investments  are  sustainable,  subprogram  1  introduced \nmore  stringent  life  cycle  public  asset  management  focusing  on  establishing  transparent \ninformation systems for improved metro, rail, and road asset management. \n \n19. \non  performance-based  budget  management.  The  government  will  complete \n\nUnder subprogram 2, the government will roll out measures to provide detailed guidance \nfirst  \n\nexpenditure \n\nframeworks \n\nits \n\n                                                \n16 Future  support  beyond  the  program  period  may  target  the  implementation  of  PEFM  reforms  in  provincial \ngovernments, subject to the successful implementation of national reforms and agreement of relevant authorities. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f5-year expenditure plans and release them publicly. It will also realize direct budgetary savings \nby reducing off-budget expenditure and curtailing use of state budget contingency funds. User \nfees will be introduced to fund maintenance and operational costs of major infrastructure assets. \n \nOutput  2:  Identification  and  management  of  fiscal  risks  strengthened. This output \n20. \nstrengthened  the  government\u2019s  management  of  fiscal  risks,  improved  transparency,  and \ntransferred responsibility for repaying liabilities to fund users. Achievements under subprogram \n1  include  the  government  strengthening  its  control  over  the  provision  and  management  of \ngovernment guarantees, reducing the maximum guarantee from 100% of investment capital to \nbelow  80%.  The  government  is  now  holding  parent  companies  directly  responsible  for \nguaranteed debts in the event of subsidiary default.17 The government completed a detailed risk \nassessment  of  the  implications  of  allowing  provincial  governments  to  mobilize  capital  from \ncommercial  banks  and  introduced  onlending  procedures  for  provinces  that  increased  their \nresponsibility for loan repayment based on their own-source revenue raising ability. In addition, \nthe  government  enhanced  transparency  and  accountability  by  requiring  state  policy  banks  to \npublicly  disclose  the  total  capital  mobilized  by  issuing  government-guaranteed  bonds  and  to \ndisclose their financial status at the time the bonds are issued. \n \n21. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the government  will  prioritize  adhering  to  sustainable  public  debt \nlimits  and  will  ensure  that  the  overall  stock  of  government  guarantees  declines.  To  further \nincrease  transparency,  the  government  will  prepare  a  consolidated  annual  public  debt  report \ndisclosing  all  types  of  central  government  debt,  including  government  guarantees.  Under \nsubprogram  2, the government  will  encourage discipline  in the  use  of government guarantees \nby developing a methodology for calculating risk-based user fees to offset fiscal costs created \nby  the guarantees. The government  will  ensure provincial  governments comply  with onlending \npolicies  to  increase  their  accountability  for  borrowing,  and  will  issue  guidelines  to  define  ODA \nand concessional borrowing financial management mechanisms in more detail. \n \n22. \nOutput  3:  Oversight  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  budget  implementation \nimproved.  This  output  strengthened  systems  for  evaluating  public  investment  and  enhanced \nthe legal framework for preventing the misuse of public funds. Achievements under subprogram \n1  include  the  government  upgrading  the  State  Audit  Law  to  require  a  state  audit  of  all \nenterprises in which the state holds more than 50% of charter capital. This reform requires (i) a \nstate audit of agencies that mobilize and manage public debts, and (ii) the public disclosure of \naudit  reports  along  with  the  government\u2019s  annual  report  of  consolidated  audit  results.  The \ngovernment strengthened the supervision of public investment by mandating the preparation of, \nand  compulsory  funding  allocations  for,  annual  project  evaluation  reports.  It  established \nevaluation criteria to systematically assess the efficiency and effectiveness of public investment \nand  introduced  a  uniform  data  management  framework  for  results-based  monitoring.  The \ngovernment also strengthened budget oversight by the National Assembly. The reforms provide \nfor  a  review  of  5-year  financial  and  public  debt  repayment  plans  and  any  supplementary \nappropriations  using  over-realized  revenues.  To  allow  for  a  more  comprehensive  review  of \nbudget  submissions,  the  government  increased  the  amount  of  time  that  budget  screening \ncommittees may take to review budget documentation from 45 days to 55 days. \n \n23. \nUnder subprogram 2, the government will upgrade information management systems to \nprovide  results-based  monitoring  data  for  public  investment  nationally  and  provincially.  It  will \nfurther  strengthen  supervision  and  evaluation  by  introducing  minimum  quality  standards  to  all \nproject  evaluation  reports.  To  increase  transparency,  the  government  will  publish  SAV\u2019s \n                                                \n17 In 2015, domestically guaranteed debt by the central government was equal to $9.2 billion, or 4.9% of GDP. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nconsolidated audit results for 2015 and 2016, as well as all complete state audits for enterprises. \nIt will also publish monitoring and evaluation reports for at least 50% of capital expenditure on \nthe public investment information portal of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n24. \nTo finance subprogram 1, the government has requested a loan of $200 million, with an \nequivalent amount programmed for subprogram 2. The loans for subprogram 1 will include one \nof $117.3 million equivalent financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) and another of $82.7 million financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an \ninterest rate of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ordinary capital resources loan will have a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  Policy-based  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n25. \nIn 2016, the government plans to borrow approximately $20.9 billion to cover a budget \ndeficit of 5% of GDP, with an estimated $4.9 billion to be mobilized from ODA to fill the financing \ngap.  The  size  of  the  loan  reflects  the  government\u2019s  financing  needs  and  the  weight  of  the \nprogram as highlighted by the net economic benefits and the costs of implementation calculated \nin the program impact assessment.18  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n26.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  MPI,  the  National  Assembly  Committee  for \nFinancial  and  Budgetary  Affairs,  and  SAV  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  A  steering \ncommittee,  chaired  by  MOF  and  with  implementing  agencies  as  members,  will  oversee  the \nprogram.  The  implementation  period  is  from  November  2014  to  September  2016  for \nsubprogram 1, and from October 2016 to July 2018 for subprogram 2. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n27. \nThe  government  has  requested  TA  to  support  the  implementation  of  reforms  under \nsubprogram  2. 19 The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $650,000,  of  which  $575,000  equivalent  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  MOF  and \nMPI  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other \nfacilities.  The  scope  of  the  TA  parallels  the  three  program  outputs  and  provides  (i)  technical \nsupport to enhance infrastructure asset management, (ii) an analysis of risk-sharing mechanisms \nbetween the central and provincial governments, (iii) upgrades of public debt management toward \ninternational  standards,  (iv)  support  to  implement  the  Public  Investment  Law  (2014)  and  the \nDecree  on  Supervision  and  Evaluation  of  Public  Investment,  and  (v)  capacity  building  to \nimplement gender-responsive budgeting practices in targeted line agencies. \n \n28.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  MOF  and  MPI  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. The TA  will  begin in January  2017  and  will  be  implemented  over  15 months  ending \n\n                                                \n18 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fMarch  2018.  The  TA  will  provide  8  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  \n22  person-months of  national  consulting services. The consultants  will  work  on  an  intermittent \nbasis  and  will  be  engaged  following  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  following  ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29. \nA  growing  body  of  empirical  research  demonstrates  the  strong  link  between  quality \npublic financial management systems and economic growth and poverty reduction.20 A program \nimpact assessment was prepared to estimate the potential benefits and costs of subprogram 1 \nusing a cost\u2013benefit analysis framework. Once fully implemented, the net benefits are expected \nto  approximate  $1.04  billion  per  annum.  The  benefits  will  come  from  budget  efficiencies  and \nsavings generated through (i) better government planning and asset management, (ii) a transfer \nof extra-budgetary accounts into the consolidated budget, (iii) a reduction in the amount and risk \nfrom government guarantees, and (iv) efficiencies derived from enhanced project evaluation and \nmonitoring systems.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nA  governance  risk  assessment  was  conducted 21 and  the  government  undertook  and \n30. \npublished its first public expenditure financial accountability assessment in July 2013 (footnote \n6).  While  there  have  been  improvements  in  the  quality  of  budget  operations,  the  government \ncontinues  to  face  challenges  in  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  public  fund  usage.  To \naddress these challenges, the government is pursuing a progressive  reform agenda. ADB has \nsupported  these  efforts since  2008  with initiatives  to  improve planning,  strengthen PEFM,  and \nincrease  legal  transparency  and  accessibility.  These  efforts  are  being  further  expanded  and \ndeepened  under  the  planned  program  (footnote  13).  Consistent  with  commitments  to  good \ngovernance,  program \nfor \nimplementation  will \nImplementing the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.22 \n \n31. \nwith the government and the MOF. \n \nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Revised  Staff  Guidelines \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nThe  program  will  have positive impacts  on  poverty  and social  issues.  The program  will \nsupport  higher  economic  growth  from  better  quality  infrastructure  and  services  as  a  result  of \nmore efficient state budget expenditure. At the same time, economic growth will become more \nsustainable  by  alleviating  fiscal  pressures  and  putting  in  place  a  more  disciplined  system  of \npublic  debt  management.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  program  will  be  classified  some  gender \nelements  because  of  its  support  for  introducing  gender  equity  and  performance measurement \nprinciples  into  state  budget  systems.  This  will  allow  for  a  more  targeted  allocation  of  public \nresources to the poor and other vulnerable groups such as women.  \n\n                                                \n20 Peterson.

Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan (footnote 21). The expected net benefits and impacts of the program are \nexpected  to  outweigh the risks.  At  the macroeconomic  level, medium  risks  include  public debt \nconstraints  which could disrupt  investment  plans  and weak  institutional  coordination  that  limits \nthe  ability  of  the  authorities  to  fully  implement  reforms.  Development  partners  are  providing \ncoordinated policy dialogue and support to the government to improve public debt management \nand  rebuild  economic  buffers.  At  the  microeconomic  level,  medium  risks  include  reforms  that \nmay  make  it  more  challenging  for  provincial  governments  to  raise  capital,  and  insufficient \nhuman  capacity  that  might  hamper  the  achievement  of  targeted  reforms,  particularly  if  vested \ninterests  resist  new  accountability  and  transparency  measures.  ADB  will  work  with  central \ngovernment ministries and the National Assembly to mitigate these risks. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied that  the proposed programmatic  approach and  policy-based  loans  would \n36. \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Improving  Public  Expenditure  Quality \nProgram; \nthe loan of $82,700,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Improving  Public  Expenditure  Quality  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15  years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board; and \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR85,483,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Improving  Public  Expenditure \nQuality  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund),  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n21 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nProvision of infrastructure and service delivery improved (Finance Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020)a \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \na\u2013c.
