THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $152,500,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $24,500,000 and (ii) a B loan of up to \n$128,000,000, to Dau Tieng Tay Ninh Energy Joint Stock Company (DTE) for the B.Grimm Viet \nNam Solar Power Project (Dau Tieng Project) in Viet Nam. The report also describes the proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $8,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private \nInfrastructure Fund (LEAP)1 for the B.Grimm Viet Nam Solar Power Project (Dau Tieng Project) \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the LEAP loan. \n \n2.  The loan will support DTE to operate a 240-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic power plant \nand its associated facilities in Tay Ninh Province, Viet Nam, which is one of the largest solar power \nprojects in Southeast Asia to date. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing will meet the \nborrower\u2019s  requirements  for  longer-tenor  United  States  (US)  dollar-denominated  project \nfinancing, which local financial institutions are unable to provide, and will also catalyze commercial \ncofinancing with a high cofinancing ratio. Further, the project will help Viet Nam achieve its long-\nterm targets for solar power capacity and greenhouse gas emissions, and will accelerate progress \nin gender equality. In addition, the loan will be an internationally verified green loan. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. High rates of economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization \nare leading to growing electricity demand in Viet Nam, which has become the second largest \npower  market  in  Southeast  Asia  (after  Indonesia).  Electricity  demand  has  grown  rapidly, \naveraging 11.5% per year from 2005 to 2019, and is projected to grow at more than 8.0% per \nyear through 2030. However, meeting fast-growing electricity demand and sustaining high rates \nof economic growth will be a significant challenge for Viet Nam. According to the Revised National \nPower Development Master Plan, 2011\u20132020, Viet Nam needs to invest about $148 billion in \npower transmission and generation infrastructure from 2016 to 2030.2 Because of financial \nconstraints on the state utility Vietnam Electricity (EVN) and limits on sovereign borrowing, private \nsector investment will be essential to avoid future power shortages. \n \n4.  In 2019, large hydropower, coal, gas, and other fossil fuel projects comprised nearly 90% \nof Viet Nam\u2019s 55.9 gigawatts (GW) of installed power capacity. With (i) limited room to develop \nlarge-scale hydropower plants, (ii) depleting domestic coal reserves, and (iii) growing public \nconcern over environmental issues, renewable energy development is receiving significantly \ngreater focus. \n \n5.  In  April  2017,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  issued  a  decision  to  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of private sector solar projects. This decision included a provision for a 20-year feed-\nin tariff (FIT) of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour for utility-scale solar power projects, the provision under \nwhich the power purchase agreement (PPA) for this project was agreed. Although the new FIT \npolicy sparked significant private sector interest, project developers and financiers faced two \nmajor challenges. First, developers wishing to receive the FIT were required to be commissioned \n \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Industry and Trade. 2016.

Ha Noi. \n ", "2 \nby the end of June 2019\u2014a compressed development and construction time frame. Second, they \nwere required to use the standard (PPA) issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which is \nnot considered bankable for international lenders on a nonrecourse project finance basis because \nof  its  lack  of  sufficient  protection  for  curtailment,  changes  in  law,  and  various  termination \nscenarios. Since developers were unable to obtain long-term project financing under these \nconditions, they proceeded with project construction using a combination of sponsor equity, short-\nterm supplier credit, or corporate loans with short tenors and in local currency (dong). This was \nconsidered  an  interim  arrangement  for  many  developers,  and  experienced  international \ndevelopers such as B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited (B.Grimm) continued their efforts to \nstructure more sustainable long-term financing solutions. \n \n6.  By June 2019, 82 solar power plants, with a total capacity of nearly 4.5 GW, had been \ncommissioned and connected to the national grid. In latest forecasts, installed solar power \ncapacity is projected to increase to 18.6 GW, a target nearly achieved in 2020, when installed \nsolar power capacity reached 16.6 GW.3 However, while the rapid development of solar power \ncapacity is considered a great success, the need for sustainable financing solutions remains of \nparamount importance to support the renewable energy sector\u2019s long-term viability and stability. \nFurther, rapid development has resulted in network congestion in some areas, and certain \nprojects have experienced curtailment issues because of grid capacity constraints. \n \n7.  Since 2018, ADB has engaged in discussions with project developers to explore options \nfor financing solutions. Establishing a viable long-term financing structure is critical to support the \nsustainable development of Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector. The ADB approach has been \nto (i) selectively support high-quality landmark projects developed by reputable sponsors, and \n(ii) take the lead in developing a bankable structure to help catalyze commercial bank cofinancing \nto Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector by reducing the market perception that long-term financing \nis not feasible. In late 2018, B.Grimm approached ADB to discuss its development pipeline in Viet \nNam and potential financing structures.4 The projects were considered suitable because of their \nsize and strategic location, and B.Grimm\u2019s strong technical capacity and record as a developer. \n \n8.  In response to market conditions and sponsor demand, ADB has taken the lead to develop \nan innovative project finance solution with tailor-made sponsor support to address the key risks \nin Viet Nam\u2019s standard PPA. ADB\u2019s involvement in this project will showcase one of the first \ninternational limited-recourse financings for one of the biggest solar power projects in the country \n(and in Southeast Asia). Through its B loan, ADB will also mobilize one of the largest commercial \ncofinancing packages for a renewable energy project to date in Viet Nam. The entire ADB loan \nwill be externally verified as a green loan based on the Green Loan Principles.5 \n \n9.  Project design. The project consists of the development and operation of a 240 MW solar \nphotovoltaic power plant and its associated facilities in Tay Ninh Province, Viet Nam. The project \nis connected to the national grid and has entered into a 20-year PPA with EVN. It will directly \n \n3  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Industry and Trade. 2021.

While Viet Nam has made considerable progress in addressing gender \ndisparities,  women\u2019s  economic  opportunities  remain  constrained  because  of  significant \nsegregation of men and women in terms of occupation and industry of employment, an unequal \nburden of unpaid care work, and general resistance to women taking up leadership positions.6 In \nthe renewable energy sector, only a small proportion of women are in management, technical, \nand field-based roles, with the highest concentrations of women in administration, finance, and \nhuman resources. This project incorporates gender measures that seek to support the closing of \nsome of the identified gender gaps. \n \n11.  Borrower and sponsor. The borrower, DTE, was established in 2018 to develop, build, \nand operate the project. DTE will be fully owned by B.Grimm. B.Grimm, established in 1993, is \none of the largest private power generation companies among Thailand\u2019s small power producer \noperators. As of October 2020, B.Grimm had total generating capacity of  3.0 GW from a \ndiversified portfolio including 17 gas-fired cogeneration plants, 24 solar power plants, and 3 \nhydropower plants. B.Grimm has also established climate targets to increase the share of \nrenewable energy as a percentage of installed capacity in its portfolio from 8% in 2017 to 30% in \n2022. B.Grimm is ADB\u2019s existing private sector client. It issued Thailand\u2019s first certified climate \nbond in 2019 with ADB assistance.7 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n12.

Development Impact, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n13.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: the proportion of power produced \nfrom renewable energy sources in the power generation mix in Viet Nam increased and the solar \npower capacity increased. \n \n14.  Outcomes. The project has the following outcomes: renewable power delivered to the \ndomestic grid increased, green loan status maintained during the life of the loan, and additional \njobs and revenues generated.  \n15.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are as follows: (i) a 240 MW solar photovoltaic power \nproject and its associated facilities are operational, (ii) green loan status is achieved, (iii) gender \nequality in staffing is enhanced, (iv) gender inclusiveness of the work environment is enhanced, \nand (v) capacity of women in renewable technologies is enhanced. \n  \nC.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  outlines  seven  operational  priorities  to  address  development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific.9 The project supports three of those priorities: (i) tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability; (ii) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; and (iii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality. It also supports Strategy 2030\u2019s objectives to expand the role of \nprivate sector operations and mobilize additional resources in addition to ADB\u2019s own financing. \n \n17.  The project is aligned with two of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020: (i) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery, \nand (ii) improving environmental sustainability and climate change response.10 The project is also \naligned with Viet Nam\u2019s climate commitments as highlighted in its updated Nationally Determined \nContribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, targeting an \nunconditional reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 9% and a conditional reduction of 27% \nbelow business as usual by 2030.11 \n \n18.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments in energy \nefficiency and renewable energy projects.12 It will contribute to ADB\u2019s 2030 targets for climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation financing, cofinancing for private sector operations, and the \npromotion of gender equality. Consistent with a One ADB approach, the project benefited from \nclose cross-departmental coordination with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department in assessing and \nanalyzing Viet Nam\u2019s energy sector. \n \n19.  Lessons from previous operations. The project builds on results and lessons from the \nclose cooperation between ADB sovereign operations and the government for energy sector \nreform.13 It also adds to ADB\u2019s growing portfolio of solar projects in Viet Nam, such as the Floating \nSolar Energy Project, the Gulf Solar Power Project, and the B.Grimm Viet Nam Solar Power \nProject (Phu Yen Project).14 Building on these other projects, the project improves the tailor-made \nsponsor support and will scale up ADB\u2019s assistance and cofinancing to make it one of the largest \nsolar power projects in Southeast Asia. \n \n20.  The total ADB A loan and cofinancing amount of up to $160,500,000 will be counted as \nclimate change financing (mitigation) because it matches the criteria according to the joint \nmultilateral development banks methodology.15 \n \nD.

To meet the June 2019 \ndeadline for the commercial operation date under the PPA, the project was initially financed \nwith sponsor\u2019s equity and a deferred payment arrangement with the EPC contractors. \nConstruction  The EPC contractors are Power China Huadong Engineering Corporation and Sinohydro \nCorporation Limited, which are both subsidiaries of Power Construction Corporation of \narrangements \nChina, Ltd. The EPC contracts are standard fixed-price, date-certain turnkey contracts. \nThe photovoltaic panels were manufactured by Jinko Solar Holding Company Limited. \nRevenue structure  DTE sells electricity generated by the project to Vietnam Electricity under a 20-year PPA \nat a fixed feed-in tariff of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour. The tariff is paid in dong but indexed \nto the United States dollar. ADB will receive sponsor support to mitigate key risks from \nViet Nam\u2019s standard PPA for renewable energy. \nOperation and  DTE has entered into two separate operation and maintenance contracts: the first is for \nthe power plant and was entered into with Power China Huadong Engineering \nmaintenance \nCorporation; the second is for the substation and was entered into with a consortium \nconsisting of V.T.E.C.H Electrical Technology Co., Ltd. and Technical Service Center 4.  \nPerformance  DTE will submit to ADB (i) development effectiveness reports on key performance \nindicators, (ii) semiannual unaudited and annual audited financial statements, and \nmonitoring \n(iii) environmental and social monitoring reports. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; DTE = Dau Tieng Tay Ninh Energy Joint Stock Company; EPC = engineering, \nprocurement, and construction; PPA = power purchase agreement.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s assistance will have three components: (i) a direct senior secured loan (A loan) of \nup to $24,500,000, (ii) a B loan of up to $128,000,000 to be funded by participating financial \ninstitutions, and (iii) administration of a parallel senior secured loan of up to $8,000,000 to be \nprovided  by  LEAP.  The  A  loan  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  ADB adds value by mobilizing a long-term financing package that would not have been \navailable without ADB. International lenders are not comfortable offering long-term US dollar-\ndenominated debt on a nonrecourse basis in the Vietnamese renewables market because of \nconcerns regarding the PPA and the nascency of the sector. Local banks are unable to offer US \ndollar-denominated  longer-tenor  debt.  As  one  of  the  first  and  biggest  international  limited-\nrecourse project finance transactions in Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector, together with the \nPhu  Yen  project  (footnote  4),  the  project  will  demonstrate  the  potential  for  private  sector \n \n16 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \ninvestment in the sector, send a strong signal to the market, and attract other investors for similar \ninvestments. ADB has led the structuring of the transaction and is crowding in commercial banks \nunder the B loan structure, at a cofinancing ratio of $5.2 for every $1 of ADB assistance.17 ADB \nwill offer a longer tenor than participating commercial banks, help to improve debt service \ncoverage ratios for lenders, and thereby improve the project\u2019s financial viability. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s support for the project will demonstrate that innovative financing solutions can \naddress existing challenges in this nascent market. The support also contributes to B.Grimm\u2019s \ntarget of increasing the share of renewable energy in its portfolio, and will confirm the loan as a \ngreen loan, allowing B.Grimm to showcase its commitment to climate-friendly investments. ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement  and  due  diligence  will  ensure  that  the  project  is  developed  and  operated  to \ninternational best practice standards and will perform to expectations over the project life. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation in the project will enable gender design features and targets to be incorporated and \nwill also ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC.

ADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  B),  and \nindigenous peoples (category C). Safeguard Requirement 4 for existing facilities is applicable.18  \n \n26.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures implemented by DTE to avoid, minimize, and mitigate \nthe  adverse  impacts.  An  environmental  and  social  compliance  audit,  including  on-site \nassessment, was conducted by the borrower\u2019s consultant to identify past or present concerns \nrelated to the impacts on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nenvironmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of DTE to \nmanage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts according to the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement are deemed adequate. DTE commits to address and implement the \nenvironmental and social corrective action plan for the project. \n \n27.  Environment. The project\u2019s local environmental impact assessment report was approved \nby the People\u2019s Committee of Tay Ninh Province on 12 June 2018 with Decision No. 1483/QD-\nUBND. The project occupies a total land area of 274.1 hectares (ha) located at the western edge \nof Dau Tieng Reservoir; about 90% of the project area experiences seasonal inundation from \nOctober to March. The Dau Tieng Reservoir Authority confirmed that the reservoir is not classified \nas a key biodiversity area and does not support globally or nationally threatened species. The \nproject was designed based on a 200-year return period of Dau Tieng Reservoir, which is deemed \nadequate to address the climate high risk factors (e.g., flood, increased precipitation) identified in \nthe report produced by the Aware for Projects climate risk screening tool.19 The environmental \nand social compliance audit report proposed a corrective action plan to comply with ADB\u2019s \n \n17 The overall cofinancing ratio is 5.6 times, including the LEAP parallel loan of $8 million. \n18 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n19 Aware for Projects is an online tool used by ADB project teams to screen projects for climate risks. \n ", "7 \nrequirements, which includes the following: (i) strengthen the environmental and social capacity \nof the project team, (ii) implement an occupational health and safety plan and emergency plan to \nrespond to operational safety risks and incidents, (iii) implement a waste management plan and \nstrengthen housekeeping practices, and (iv) enhance the project\u2019s grievance redress mechanism \nand adopt a stakeholder engagement plan. DTE will implement the corrective action plan to \naddress the gaps before the loan drawdown. It will regularly report to ADB on the project\u2019s \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s requirements and applicable local environmental, health, and safety laws \nand regulations. \n \n28.  Social. The solar farm and other project facilities are located on 274.1 ha of state-owned \nand managed land. The 270.2 ha solar farm has been leased by the government to DTE for a \nperiod of 50 years. Land use rights for project-related facilities such as the transmission line, \ntransmission towers, and access road (comprising about 4 ha) were acquired by DTE directly \nfrom land users through negotiated settlement following statutory requirements and procedures. \nThe land for the solar farm is low-lying, situated along the western edge of Dau Tieng Reservoir \nand seasonally inundated. During other seasons, and depending upon the soil condition, it was \nmostly used for cassava or sugarcane cultivation by informal land users. These users did not \nhave any legal title to the land, but had been using it for sustenance and livelihood purposes. \nAlthough the affected users were not solely dependent on this land for their livelihoods, the land \ntake for the project caused the loss of or disruption to the livelihoods of 88 households (352 \npersons), of which 7 affected households (28 persons) were assessed to have lost 10% or more \nof their income sources. The affected households include one temporary household with two \ninformal occupants who were physically displaced from a seasonal dwelling made of temporary \nmaterials situated near the boundary of the solar plant within the vicinity of the reservoir. The \nenvironmental and social compliance audit confirmed that the project took measures to address \nthe impact on income and livelihood losses to the affected households, despite the informal land \nuse and in the absence of a binding statutory requirement. In lieu of land compensation and in \nrecognition  of  the  partial  economic  dependence,  the  affected  land  users  were  provided \n(i) compensation for loss of trees and crops, (ii) additional support to cope with the transition or \nsubsistence loss, and (iii) an additional financial incentive for surrendering informal land use rights \nto the project. The audit further confirmed that compensation unit prices for crops and other assets \nwere in accordance with the local regulations and broadly equivalent to the market price. The one \ntemporary household that was physically displaced has been relocated, awarded with land use \nrights for a plot of community land by the commune people\u2019s committee, and received financial \nsupport from DTE for their newly constructed house. \n \n29.  The environmental and social compliance audit assessed that (i) the transfer of land rights \nwas done following statutory requirements, (ii) all affected households were compensated for  loss \nof income resulting from loss of access to land and other productive assets and in recognition of \ntheir informal user rights, (iii) no legacy or ongoing encumbrances or risks are associated with \nproject lands, and (iv) the compensation process provided enhanced compensation and other \nbenefits that exceed statutory requirements and were generally aligned with ADB\u2019s requirements. \nTo address the long-term impact of income and livelihood loss and build on the livelihood support \nalready provided to affected households, DTE has committed to develop a livelihood restoration \nplan  for  significantly  affected,  willing,  and  vulnerable  households  before  the  first  loan \ndisbursement. The plan will include a detailed assessment of affected households\u2019 socioeconomic \nconditions and the provision of opportunities for skills building and alternative livelihoods to ensure \nthe restoration of sustenance and livelihood status to at least pre-project levels. The project has \nno known impacts on indigenous peoples. It is not located in an area which is owned, claimed, or \nused by any ethnic minorities. \n \n ", "8 \n30.  Effective gender mainstreaming. As of February 2021, 7 of DTE\u2019s 17 staff were female, \nbut none of the management or technical roles were held by women. DTE does not have an anti-\nsexual harassment policy or an internship program. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment  (1998),  DTE  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as \nfollows: (i) an increase in the number of women employed by DTE in technical or managerial \nroles,  (ii)  50%  of  the jobs  in  grass  cutting  are  held  by  women, (iii) the  development  and \nimplementation of an internship program with at least 50% of internships offered to women, \n(iv) inclusion of anti-sexual harassment provisions in DTE\u2019s code of conduct, and (v) training of \nstaff  on  anti-sexual  harassment  provisions.  DTE  will  submit  periodic  reports  on  the \nimplementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n31.  DTE will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards.20 \nDTE will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such laws and \n(ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will follow \nADB requirements.21 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n32.  DTE and B.Grimm were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n33.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n34.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),22 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Viet \nNam has no objection to the proposed assistance to DTE. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$152,500,000, comprising  (i)  an  A  loan  of  up  to  $24,500,000  from ADB\u2019s  ordinary capital \nresources and (ii) a B loan of up to $128,000,000, to Dau Tieng Tay Ninh Energy Joint Stock \nCompany for the B.Grimm Viet Nam Solar Power Project (Dau Tieng Project) in Viet Nam, with \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, \n \n20 ADB. 2003.
