FSPL  II  takes  a  cluster  approach  and  consists  of  two  back-to-\nback  subprograms.  Implementation  of  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I  is \nscheduled for completion in December 2004. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Financial Sector \nSubsector: Nonbanking \nThemes:  Sustainable  economic  growth,  Governance,  and  Pivate \nsector development \n \nCategory C. \nThe  environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no  significant \nadverse impact was identified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C. \nImpact on Indigenous People: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  financial  sector  mirrors  its  economy  and  is  in  transition. \nThe  Government  has  made  persistent  efforts  to  modernize  and \ntransform  the  financial  sector,  recognizing  its  significance  to  the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  performance.  Still,  plagued  by  many  factors \ninherited from the former regime, the formal financial system remains \nunderdeveloped, inefficient, and inaccessible to many. \n \nFinancial  intermediation  is  low,  and  is  dominated  by  bank  savings \nand \nlevels  of \nnonperforming \nfully  support  economic \ndevelopment  and  generate  employment.  The  Government  has \ninitiated the process for financial and operational restructuring of the \nbanking  subsector  with  assistance  from  the  International  Monetary \nFund (IMF) and World Bank under the poverty reduction and growth \nfacility (PRGF) and poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) in June \n2001.  FSPL  II  was  formulated  to  complement  this  process.  It \nspecifically  addresses  the  need  to  develop  alternative  channels  of \nfinancial intermediation to support Viet Nam\u2019s broad-based economic \ngrowth  and  socioeconomic  development  objectives, \nincluding \npoverty reduction. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Board  approved  the  cluster \nconcept of FSPL II and subprogram I for $50 million from the Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  on  20  November  2002.  Subprogram  I \nachieved  concrete  outputs  and  all  subprogram  I  second-tranche \nrelease  conditions  had  been  fully  or  substantially  complied  with  by \n\nloans.  The  banking  system\u2014with \nloans\u2014is  unable \n\nits  high \n\nto \n\n\fiii \n\nto  support \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  effort \n\nOctober 2004. The Government has shown solid commitment to the \nreform program and is ready to continue with subprogram II.    \n \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II, building on achievements of subprogram I, \nto  develop \nwill  continue \nalternative  channels  of  financial  intermediation  such  as  money  and \ncapital  markets,  insurance,  leasing,  and  financial  infrastructure  to \nenhance  public  confidence.  The  nonbanking  subsector  and  the \ncapital  market  will  provide  long-term  funds  and  investment  capital \nthat  are  largely  lacking  in  Viet  Nam.  Higher  efficiency  may  be \nachieved  through  increased  competition  from  the  nonbanking \nsubsector. The financial system as a whole will be broader, better \nbalanced, and more resilient to external shocks. \n \nThe objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to enable the \ndevelopment  of  alternative  channels  of  market-based  financial \nintermediation.  Necessary  components  include  (i)  economic \npolicies  conducive \nfinancial  sector \ndevelopment;  (ii)  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  that  will \npromote innovation and healthy competition while monitoring and \nreducing systemic risks; (iii) regulators with the authority, budget, \nskills,  and  established  procedures \nto  monitor  and  enforce \nregulations; and (iv) supporting financial infrastructure. \n \nTo achieve the objective, the FSPL II focuses on \n(i) \n\nestablishing  a  regulatory  framework  for  insurance  business, \nstrengthening  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  frameworks, \nand promoting the development of key professionals; \n(ii)  promoting  the  leasing  industry  by  creating  a  coherent\nregulatory  framework,  establishing  ground  rules  for  contract \nenforcement, and enhancing public awareness; \n\nto  sound  and  vibrant \n\n(iii)  enabling interbank and money market development through \nphased  interest  rate  deregulation,  more  money  market \ninstruments,  and  increased  development  of  the  market \nmicrostructure; \nfostering  the  capital  markets\u2019  financial  intermediation  by  (a) \nestablishing \nregulatory \nframework  for  increasing  quality  shares  trading  on  the \nsecurities market, (b) strengthening market surveillance, and \n(c) building the basis for institutional investors; and \n\nincentives  compatible  with \n\nthe \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  continuing  to  support  financial  infrastructure  such  as  the \naccounting  and  auditing  systems,  a  secured  transactions \nsystem, a deposit insurance system (assisted under FSPL I), \nand the beginnings of an anti-money-laundering regime. \n\n \nObjective and \nScope \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms  Subprogram II of FSPL II will comprise a loan to be drawn from the \nADF that will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  and  carry  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Subprogram \nII of FSPL II is also proposed to be cofinanced by Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) for \u20ac12 million. \n\niv \n\n \n\n \nProgram Period and  \nTranches \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n \n\nthird \n\ntranche \n\n \nThe loan for subprogram II of $35 million will be released in three \ntranches:  (i)  $10  million  upon  fulfillment  of  specified  first  tranche \nrelease conditions, (ii) $15 million subject to fulfillment of specified\nsecond  tranche  release  conditions,  and  (iii)  $10  million  after \nrelease  conditions. \ncompletion  of  specified \nImplementation of subprogram II is planned for 1 April 2005 to 1 \nApril 2007. \n \nThe  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  will  continue  to  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  for  subprogram  II.  To  coordinate  program \nimplementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned,  a  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  has  been \nformed.  The  PSC,  chaired  by  a  deputy  governor  of  SBV, \ncomprises  senior  officers  from  all  ministries  and  government \nagencies concerned. The PSC will continue to meet twice yearly \nand  on  an  ad-hoc  basis  to  review  pending  issues  and  propose \nconcrete  actions  to  resolve  them,  thus  ensuring  timely  program \nimplementation. A program implementation and coordination unit, \nformed  within  SBV  and  headed  by  a  senior  SBV  officer,  will \ncontinue to assist ADB and the PSC in implementation. \n \nThe proceeds of the FSPL II\u2014subprogram II will be disbursed for \na  broad  range  of  imports,  subject  to  a  negative  list  of  ineligible \nitems.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in  and \noriginating  from  ADB  member  countries  will  be  made  with  due \nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with \nstandard public sector procedures in Viet Nam and normal private \nsector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. The Borrower will \ncertify  that  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from \nnonmember \n(iii) \ndisbursements made under other official development assistance \nis  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  the \nyear. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n \nThe  policy  framework  for  FSPL  II  includes  specific  components \nthat bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The counterpart \nfunds to be generated from loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe structural adjustment costs arising from FSPL II. \n \n\nimports,  and \n\ncountries, \n\nineligible \n\n(ii) \n\n\fRisks and Safeguards \n\nv \n\nFSPL  II  faces  three  principal  risks.  The  first  is  the  resurfacing  of \nsociopolitical  pressure  that  could  delay  reform.  Materialization  of \nthis risk is contingent on economic performance. Judging from the \ncurrent  status  of  the  economy  and  its  outlook\u2014as  well  as  pro-\nreform  statements  and  achievements  made  by  the  Government \nwith full public support\u2014this risk is currently limited. Nevertheless, \nmacroeconomic  conditions  and  the  sociopolitical  situation  will  be \nclosely monitored against program objectives. \n \nThe  second  risk  relates  to  progress  in  restructuring  state-owned \nbanks and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), both of which weigh \nheavily on Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector. Many technical difficulties \nremain, and slower-than-expected progress has had implications \non achieving the objectives of FSPL II. However, the momentum \nbuilding  toward  carrying  out  the  reform  process  is  strong  within \nthe  Government.  The  comprehensive  frameworks  that  the  World \nBank  developed  under  the  PRSC  for  restructuring  banks  and \nSOEs,  as  well  as  associated  technical  assistance  from  bilateral \nagencies,  will  provide  the  necessary  technical  support.  ADB's \nclose coordination with IMF and the World Bank will continue, in \norder  to  synchronize  the  subsectoral  reform  measures  and \nachieve the full benefits of FSPL II.  \n \nThe third risk pertains to the technical capacities of implementing \nagencies.  The  Government\u2019s  track  record  suggests  that,  given \nadequate  technical  support,  its  commitment  to  undertake  the \nproposed  reforms  is  strong.  In  implementing  subprogram  I,  for \nexample, delays were predominantly a result of a lack of technical \nexpertise  in  the  financial  sector,  particularly  for  drafting  laws, \nrules,  and  regulations.  The  delays  were  exacerbated  by  the \nconsensus building approach taken for their enactment, requiring \ninterministerial  coordination.  To  reduce  this  risk,  comprehensive \ndiscussions were undertaken with the implementing agencies and \nthe  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  capacity  building  will \ntackle  the  technical  difficulties  anticipated  with  implementing  the \npolicy actions proposed under FSPL II. \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram II of the Financial Sector Program Loan II \n(FSPL II). \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nOn 20 November 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board approved FSPL II,1 \n2. \n(i)  the  cluster  concept  of  3  subprograms  for  $75  million,  and  (ii)  subprogram  I  for  $50  million \nfrom the Asian Development Fund (ADF) to be released in two tranches: one of $20 million and \none of $30 million. The program\u2019s objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts in building an \nenabling  environment  for  alternative  channels  of  market-based  financial  intermediation. \nAlternative  financial  intermediation  is  becoming  increasingly  important  for  Viet  Nam,  whose \nfinancial sector remains dominated by bank savings and loans. The banking sector alone, with \nits high-level of nonperforming loans and planned restructuring, cannot support the economy in \nachieving  its  potential  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth,  nor  can  it  generate  employment \nfor  the  expanding  labor  force.  Necessary  components  for  an  enabling  environment  include  (i) \neconomic  policies  conducive  to  sound  and  vibrant  financial  sector  development;  (ii)  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks  that  will  promote  innovation  and  healthy  competition  while  monitoring \nand  reducing  systemic  risks,  (iii)  regulators  with  the  authority,  budget,  skills,  and  established \nprocedures to monitor and enforce regulations, and (iv) support for financial infrastructure.  \n \n3. \nTo achieve these objectives, FSPL II focuses on (i) establishing a regulatory framework \nfor  the  insurance  industry,  strengthening  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \npromoting the development of key professionals; (ii) promoting the leasing industry by creating a \ncoherent  regulatory  framework,  establishing  ground  rules  for  contract  enforcement,  and \nenhancing  public  awareness;  (iii)  enabling  interbank  and  money  market  development  by \ngradually deregulating interest rates, increasing the number of money market instruments, and \ndeveloping the market microstructure; (iv) fostering capital market financial intermediation by (a) \nestablishing  incentives  compatible  with  the  regulatory  framework  for  increasing  the  number  of \nquality shares on the market, (b) strengthening market surveillance, and (c) building the basis \nfor participation by institutional investors; and (v) continuing to build financial infrastructure such \nas accounting and auditing systems, secured transactions system, a deposit insurance system, \nand  an  anti-money-laundering  regime.  (The  logical  framework  is  in  Appendix  1  and  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2.) \n \n4. \nSubprogram I was envisioned to be completed within 15 months from loan effectiveness. \nSubprograms  II  and  III  were  to  be  processed  sequentially  upon  completion  of  the  previous \nsubprogram and completed within 12 months from effectiveness of each proceeding loan. The \ncluster  approach  provides  the  opportunity  to  refine  proposed  policy  actions  of  succeeding \nsubprograms  in  order  to  reflect  the  Government's  achievements,  the  changing  policy \nenvironment,  and  lessons  learned  from  the  previous  subprogram.  The  program  cluster \napproach thus allows flexibility and gives leverage to implement reform measures in a dynamic \npolitical, economic, and financial environment. \n \n5. \nFSPL II loan agreement for subprogram I was signed on 29 January 2003. An inception \nmission was fielded from 17 to 18 February 2003. The Government submitted the legal opinion \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \n\nCluster to Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Program Loan II. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndated 16 May 2003 to ADB, and subprogram I of FSPL II became effective as of 23 May 2003. \nA review mission fielded from 16 to 20 June 2003 confirmed that solid progress had been made \nin fulfilling the first tranche release policy actions under subprogram I. Upon confirmation that all \nseven  conditions  were  met,  the  first  tranche  was  released  on  28  August  2003.  Subsequent \nreview missions were fielded in December 2003 and June 2004. On the basis of the progress \nmade  in  subprogram  I  implementation,  the  fact-finding  mission  for  subprogram  II  was \nundertaken from 21 to 30 June 2004.  \n \nIn  support  of  FSPL  II  implementation,  ADB  also  provided  two  technical  assistance \n6. \nprojects  (TAs).2  Technical  inputs  provided  through  the  two  projects  were  indispensable  for \ntimely completion of policy actions under subprogram I. \n \n\nIII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS \n\n7. \nViet Nam's annual economic growth rate increased from 5.8% in 2001 to 6.4% in 2002, \nand 7.1% in 2003. Growth in the industrial and construction sector was 8.9% in 2002 and 9.6% \nin 2003. Faster-paced economic growth has caused inflation to rise. The consumer price index \n(CPI) rose from 0.8% in 2001 to an average of 3-4% in 2002 and 2003. Against the backdrop of \nrobust GDP growth, fiscal and trade deficits increased, with the budget deficit widening to 4.8% \nof  GDP  in  2003  from  3.8%  in  2002.  The  current  account  deficit  rose  to  5.8%  of  GDP  in  2003 \nfrom  2.8%  in  2002.  The  overall  macroeconomic  situation  is  stable,  however,  and  the  fiscal \ndeficit sustainable. Stable macroeconomic conditions for the past 2 years, a key precondition for \nimplementing financial sector reforms, has supported FSPL II implementation. \n \nThe economic targets set by the National Assembly in November 2003\u2014GDP growth of \n8. \n7.5\u20137.8%, a CPI increase of less than 5%, and fiscal deficit below 5% of GDP\u2014are generally \nviewed  by  the  Government  and  the  donor  community  as  achievable.  The  macroeconomic \nenvironment carries no immediate risks to FSPL II implementation. However, the relatively low \nlevel of financial intermediation continues and the nonbanking sector\u2014specifically the insurance \nsector  and  the  capital  markets,  the  two  main  components  of  FSPL  II\u2014have  gained  their \nrelevance as important means of domestic savings mobilization. \n \n Viet Nam is making steady progress in structural reforms. The package of tax reforms \n9. \nwas approved by the National Assembly in May 2003 and has become effective as of January \n2004. The number of value-added taxes and exemptions has been reduced and the corporate \ntax  rates  unified  for  domestic  and  foreign-owned  enterprises.  Progress  is  also  seen  in  Viet \nNam's  commitments  toward  international  integration,  including  the  bilateral  trade  agreement \nwith the United States effective December 2001 and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) tariff \nreductions,  which  are  proceeding  as  scheduled.  Viet  Nam  also  plans  to  join  the  World  Trade \nOrganization (WTO) in 2005. On the other hand, implementation of critical reforms planned for \nlarge  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  the  four  major  state-owned  commercial  banks \n(SOCBs) have been slower than expected, with implications for the money and capital market \ncomponents  of  FSPL  II.  Accelerating  privatization  and  listing  of  large  SOEs  would  bring  the \nmuch-needed  increase  in  supply  of  securities  to  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  Securities  Trading  Center \n(STC).  Stronger  pressure  on  SOCBs  to  improve  profitability  would  also  encourage  more \ntransactions on the secondary money market. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2002.

Many measures required extensive coordination to \nascertain stakeholders' understanding, acceptance, and actual adoption. Of the 17 subprogram \nI  second  tranche  release  conditions,  15  have  been  fully  complied  with  and  2  substantially \ncomplied with (Appendix 3).  \n \n11. \nThe  insurance  component  under  subprogram  I  had  seven  second  tranche  release \nconditions,  three  of  which  are  in  support  of  creating  equal  opportunities  to  enhance \ncompetitiveness of the insurance market. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe Ministry of Finance to adopt a simple and transparent approval system \nfor changes in the operation of insurance companies (complied with). \n\n \n12. \nThe revised Circular 71, issued by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) as Circular 98 on 15 \nOctober  2004,  streamlines  the  approval  system  for  changes  in  the  operation  of  insurance \ncompanies, opening of new branches, and introduction of new products, reducing considerably \nthe time and steps required for obtaining MOF clearance. \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Ministry of Finance to continue to grant licenses for insurance brokers, \nregardless  of  the  ownership  form,  to  enhance  competitiveness  in  the \nbrokerage business (complied with). \n\n \n13. \nThe number of licensed insurance brokers rose from one state-owned company in 2001 \nto five, including one foreign-owned company and several joint-stock companies, by the end of \nSeptember 2004. \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  to  specify  incentive  measures  for  insurance \ncompanies  to  develop  new  insurance  products,  especially  for  products  in \nsupport  of  agricultural,  forestry,  and  fisheries  activities  (substantially \ncomplied with). \n\n \n14.  MOF awarded additional incentives to promote industry segments that have experienced \nsubstantial  losses  for  insurers  and  led  to  withdrawal  of  insurance  products.  To  develop \nagricultural insurance, for example, MOF licensed Groupama, a French insurance company, to \nestablish a 100%-foreign-owned, non-life insurance company and gave it preferential treatments \nin  terms  of  agents'  commissions  and  operational  scope.  General  guidelines  on  incentives  will \nneed to be prepared in future. Such guidelines, however, will require rigorous actuarial studies \nand cost/benefit analyses. \n \n15. \nsupervision and prudential regulations of the insurance sector. \n \n\nThere  are  three  subprogram  I  second  tranche  release  conditions  for  strengthening \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Ministry of Finance to adopt procedures for onsite inspection and off-\nsite surveillance for insurance companies (complied with). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe  Notice  on  the  Issuance  of  Procedures  for  On-site  Inspections  and  Off-site \n16. \nSupervisions  over  Insurance  Business,  issued  by  MOF  on  28  September  2004,  provides \ncomprehensive guidelines for conducting off-site surveillance and onsite inspection of insurance \ncompanies.  During  subprogram  I  implementation,  MOF  conducted  several  off-site  surveillance \nsessions and onsite inspections in accordance with adopted procedures. \n \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  to  adopt  accounting  system  for  insurance \ncompanies (complied with). \n\n17.  MOF  revised  Circular  72,  providing  regulations  on  financial  issues  of  insurance \nenterprise and insurance brokerage enterprise, and issued it as Circular 99 on 15 October 2004, \naligning  the  accounting  principles  for  insurance  companies  to  international  practice.  The \npreviously  adopted  accounting  system  for  calculating  reserves  of  unearned  premiums, \noutstanding  claims,  and \nincurred-but-not-reported  claims  was  particularly  problematic. \nReserving  for  non-life  insurers,  for  example,  following  the  pure  statistical  methods,  resulted  in \noverstatements  of  profits  and  commensurate  understatement  of  liabilities,  and  policyholder \nreserves in particular. \n\n \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  to  introduce  detailed  sanction  mechanisms  for \nadministrative violations in insurance businesses (complied with). \n\n \n18. \nDecree  118/2003/ND-CP  on  sanctioning  of  administrative  offences  by  insurance \ncompanies  was  issued  on  13  October  2003.  Measures  stipulated  under  the  decree  tighten \nenforcement of sanctions for administrative offences in the management and usage of licenses, \nassignment  of  insurance  contracts,  unlawful  competitive  action,  forced  purchase  of  insurance, \nbreaches  in  provisions  on  reserve  requirements,  appropriation,  management  and  usage  of \noperational reserves, investment of capital, and financial prudence. \n \n19. \ncomponent concerns developing professionals in the insurance sector. \n \n\nThe last of the seven subprogram I second tranche release conditions for the insurance \n\n  \n(vii)  The Ministry of Finance to endorse plans for development of actuaries and \nloss adjusters submitted by insurance businesses (complied with). \n\n \n20. \nIn  2002,  a  3-year  program  on  actuarial  science  opened  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC), \ncomprising  2  years\u2019  training  in  universities  in  Viet  Nam  and  1  year  of  overseas  training  at  the \nInstitute of Financial Science and Insurance at Universit\u00e9 de Lyon in France. MOF also merged \nseveral  subdepartments  at  the  Finance  Institute  of  MOF  to  create  the  Banking  Insurance \nDepartment.  The  Department  has  a  4-year  official  training  program  on  finance  and  insurance. \nPreparation  is  also  underway  for  establishing  the  insurance  training  program  for  insurance \nregulators at the Finance Institute. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), cofinancier of \nFSPL  II,  is  supporting  training  of  trainers  to  ensure  quality  of  programs  being  offered  at  the \nFinance Institute. \n \nThere  is  one  subprogram  I  second  tranche  release  condition  under  the  leasing \n21. \ncomponent.  This  condition  supports  establishing  a  regulatory  environment  conducive  to \nbusiness development. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\n(viii)  The State Bank of Viet Nam, in cooperation with related ministries and \n\nagencies, to issue guidelines on  \n \na. \nb. \nc. \n\nissuance of an import code for financial leasing companies;  \ncustom clearance procedures to facilitate importing leased assets; \navoidance of dual registration fees when the ownership of leased assets \nis transferred to the lessee upon termination of leasing period; and \nlegal recognition of a notarized copy of vehicle registration (complied \nwith).  \n\nd. \n\n \n22.  All four regulatory changes were effected as of October 2003. Concerning items a. and b. \nabove,  General  Customs  Department  issued  Circular  07,  for  the  import  code  of  leasing \ncompanies and Official Dispatch 5415/Tchq-GSOL to provide guidance on custom clearance for \nimporting lease assets to provincial and city customs on 28 October 2003.  To address item c. \nabove, MOF issued Circular 53 on 25 June 2002 for avoidance of dual registration fees and for \nitem d., the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) issued Official Dispatch 1448/TP-CC on the Notarization of \nCopies of Registration Certificates, recognizing notarized copies of vehicle registration papers.  \n \n23. \nthe development of money market instruments. \n \n\nThere  are  three  conditions  under  the  money  market  component,  two  of  which  support \n\n(ix) \n\nThe Ministry of Finance to issue short-term treasury bills with maturities of \nless than 1 year (complied with). \n\n \n24.  MOF has been issuing short-term treasury bills since 2000 under Decree 01 on an ad-\nhoc basis. The issuance is now regularized with notification on the auction publicly made on a \nquarterly  basis.  The  Treasury  now  also  issues  directions  for  issuance  of  treasury  bills  with \nmaturities of 6 months, 9 months, and 364 days to SBV. \n \n\n(x) \n\nThe State Bank of Viet Nam to issue a regulation on interbank repurchase \nagreement of valuable papers in the market and a standardized repurchase \nagreement contract to be used for interbank trading (complied with). \n\n \n25. \nSBV  issued  a  regulation  on  trading  valuable  papers  among  credit  institutions  on  15 \nOctober 2004 as Decision 1325/2004/QD-NHNN. This regulation covers regulation on interbank \nmarket for repurchase agreements. A standardized repurchase agreement contract was issued \nby the Council of the Bankers Association of Viet Nam on 13 September 2004 as Decision 284-\nQD/HHNH.   \n \n26. \ncomponent supports improvements to the structure of the money market.   \n \n\nThe  third  subprogram  I  second  tranche  release  condition  under  the  money  market \n\n(xi) \n\nThe  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  to  issue  a  regulation  on  brokerage  activities \n(complied with). \n\n \n27. \nThe  SBV  governor  issued  Decision  315/2004/QD-NHNN  on  7  April  2004  on  brokerage \nactivities, allowing licensed credit institutions to apply for licenses in money brokerage activities \nfor  certificates  of  deposit,  foreign  exchange,  interest  rate  swaps,  and  foreign  exchange  swaps \nand options. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThere were two conditions under the capital market component, the first supporting the \n\n28. \nestablishment of market surveillance system as part of the necessary regulatory framework. \n \n\n(xii)  The  State  Securities  Commission  to  adopt  (a)  a  procedure  for  market \nsurveillance,  and  (b)  an  inspection  procedure  for  securities  companies \n(complied with). \n\n \n29.  MOF,  on  behalf  of  SSC,  issued  Decision  259/QD-UBCK  on  market  surveillance  and \nDecision  258/QD-UBCK  on  inspection  procedures  for  securities  companies  both  on  27 \nSeptember 2004. All securities companies underwent SSC's onsite inspection in late 2003.  \n \n30. \ncomponent supports development of institutional investors. \n \n\nThe  second  subprogram  I  second  tranche  policy  condition  under  the  capital  market \n\n(xiii)  The  State  Securities  Commission  to  draft  an  amendment  to  Decree  48  to \ninclude  regulations  on  the  establishment  of  securities  investment  funds \n(complied with). \n\n \n31. \nDecree 144/2003/ND-CP, amending Decree 48, was issued on 28 November 2003. The \nmajor changes include (i) SSC's expanded authority to regulate initial public offerings (IPOs), (ii) \nless  stringent  requirements  for  listing,  particularly  for  those  to  be  listed  on  the  small-  and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) board, (iii) new provisions on information disclosure, increased \ncontent  and  frequency  of  information,  (iv)  rules  and  requirements  on  securities  investment \nfunds, and (v) regulations on mergers and acquisitions (M&A). \n \n32. \nThere  are  four  conditions  supporting  strengthening  of  the  financial  infrastructure.  Two \nare  for  developing  a  secured  transactions  system,  one  for  developing  a  computerized  system \nand one on resolving legal inconsistencies. \n \n\n(xiv)  The  Ministry  of  Justice  to  carry  out  necessary  activities  to  develop  a \ncentralized,  computerized,  and  networked  registration  system  for  secured \ntransactions  and  to  develop  a  national  database  system  for  the  secured \ntransactions (complied with). \n\n \n33. \nThe feasibility study for a centralized, computerized, and networked registration system \nfor secured transactions was completed in May 2002. However, the approval of the study was \ndelayed  because  of  government  concerns  over  its  cost  estimate.  The  system  design  was \nrevised during the consultative process and the Minister of Justice approved the feasibility study \non 15 October 2004 under Decision 560/QD-BTP. Implementation will begin in 2005. \n \n\n(xv)  The  Ministry  of  Justice  and  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  to  review \nregulations  on  secured  transactions  and  on  registration  of  secured \ntransactions,  and  to  ensure  the  consistency  of  current  regulations  on \nsecured transactions and their registration (substantially complied with). \n\n \n34. \nThe major inconsistency between Decree 165 drafted by MOJ and Decree 178 drafted \nby  SBV  on  the  use  of  a  single  asset  to  secure  multiple  obligations  was  reconciled  by  the \nissuance  of  Decree  85  on  25  October  2002,  revising  Decree  178.  However,  inconsistencies \nremain, principally because Decree 85 assumes no other lender than financial institutions. SBV \nand MOJ continue discussions and plan to further revise Decree 85 to ensure incorporation of \nlenders other than financial institutions.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nFSPL  II  supports  the  Government  to  further  develop  and  strengthen  the  Deposit \n35. \nInsurance  Corporation  of  Viet  Nam  (DIV).  A  subprogram  II  second  tranche  release  condition \nrelates to joint SBV-DIV on-site inspection of covered financial institutions. \n \n\n(xvi)  The  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  to  issue  a  regulation  on  procedures  for  State \nBank  of  Viet  Nam/Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  of  Viet  Nam  joint  on-site \ninspections for covered institutions (complied with). \n\n \nSubsequent  to  discussions  between  DIV  and  SBV\u2019s  Bank  Inspectorate  Division,  an \n36. \nOfficial  Dispatch  329/NHNN-TTr  was  issued  by  the  SBV  governor  on  5  April  2004.  This \nspecifies procedures for DIV in requesting a joint SBV on-site inspection when DIV encounters \nproblems with covered financial institutions. \n \n37. \nmoney-laundering system. \n \n\nThere was one subprogram II second tranche release condition for establishing the anti-\n\n(xvii)  The  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  to  submit  a  decree  on  anti-money-laundering \nregulation for the consideration of the Government (complied with). \n\n  \n38. \nSBV  submitted  a  draft  decree  on  anti-money-laundering  to  the  National  Assembly\u2019s \nstanding  committee  on  21  May  2004  under  Official  Dispatch  518/NHNN-TTr.  The  decree \ncontains  the  essential  elements  required  for  an  effective  anti-money-laundering  regime, \nincluding  provisions  for  (i)  customer  identification  by  financial  institutions,  (ii)  reporting  of \nsuspicious  transactions,  (iii)  functions  of  the  financial  intelligence  unit;  and  (iv)  international \ncooperation to fight money laundering. The Decree is expected to be issued in 2005. \n \nB. \n\nProgram Implementation  \n\n1. \n\nInsurance and Leasing Sectors \n\n \n\na.  \n\nInsurance Sector \n\n39. \nFSPL  II  supports  development  of  the  nonbanking  subsector,  represented  by  insurance \nand leasing, both of which are at the early stages of development. While the two industries are \nsmall, their growth has been exceptional. During subprogram I implementation, steady progress \nwas  made  in  putting  in  place  the  necessary  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  building  an \nenvironment to support the sound development of insurance and leasing. \n \n \n \n40. \nFSPL II aims to promote the sound development of the insurance sector by supporting \nthe  Government  in  (i)  creating  a  competitive  business  environment,  (ii)  enhancing  corporate \ngovernance of insurance companies, (iii) strengthening supervision and prudential regulations, \nand  (iv)  developing  insurance  sector  infrastructure.  The  Government,  as  a  first  step  toward \nmeeting these objectives, upgraded the insurance management division to department status in \nAugust 2003 and strengthened its supervisory capacity. MOF also hosted the 6th Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Insurance  Regulators\u2019  Meeting  and  the  ASEAN  Council  of \nInsurance Meeting from 19 to 23 August 2003. The meeting had more than 80 participants and \nconcluded  with  an  agreement  on  concrete  measures  for  cooperation  among  insurance \nsupervisors.  Viet  Nam,  as  the  host  country,  presented  thematic  reports  on  the  liberalization \nprocess of financial services in ASEAN countries and the initial results of opening up Viet Nam\u2019s \ninsurance market to foreign companies. \n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nLeasing Sector \n\nDuring  implementation  of  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I,  several  deregulatory  measures  were \n41. \nadopted to create a competitive environment for financial services (paras. 11-14), strengthening \nsupervision  and  prudential  regulations  (paras.  15-18)  and  developing  insurance  sector \ninfrastructure (paras. 19-20).  \n \n42. \nRecent  achievements  for  improving  corporate  governance  in  the  insurance  sector \ninclude  Decision  175/2003/QD-TTg  issued  by  the  prime  minister  approving  the  2003-2010 \ninsurance market development strategy. The strategy addresses, in a phased manner, some of \nthe  major  corporate  governance  issues  in  the  insurance  sector.  The  ownership  and \nmanagement of the state-owned insurance companies were reviewed and Bao Viet, the largest \nstate-owned  insurance  company,  will  be  transformed  into  a  one-member  limited  liability \ncompany  operating  under  the  Enterprise  Law.  In  accordance  with  the  strategy,  the  prime \nminister  endorsed  equitization  of  two  other  state-owned  insurers:  HCMC  Insurance  Company \n(Bao  Minh)  and  Vietnam  Reinsurance  Company  (VINARE).  In  July  2004,  Bao  Minh  issued \nshares  worth  D97  billion  or  32%  of  its  equity  to  the  public  while  VINARE  is  planned  for \nequitization and listing on the Ho Chi Minh City STC by 2007. Although the majority stake will \nremain with the state, concrete steps forward have been made toward privatization of the state-\nowned insurance companies. \n \n \n \n43. \nTo  support  the  emergent  leasing  sector,  FSPL  II  addresses  two  critical  issues:  (i)  the \nregulatory environment is not conducive to business development, and lacks clear ground rules \nfor contract enforcement; and (ii) public awareness of the leasing industry is inadequate. With \nSBV\u2019s  solid  commitment  to  developing  the  sector,  progress  was  made  not  only  in  adopting \nmeasures to fulfill FSPL II policy actions but also to enhance the operating environment for the \nsector.  \n \nA second tranche release policy action under subprogram I, requiring consultation with \n44. \nvarious government ministries and agencies, was fulfilled by October 2003 (paras. 21-22). The \nGovernment  has  taken  actions  to  improve  the  environment  for  business  development.  These \ninclude  (i)  issuance  of  a  new  regulation  facilitating  the  opening  of  new  branches,  and  (ii) \nstreamlined tax system for financial leases under Circular 24 issued by MOF on 20 March 2003. \nSBV is also revising the decree and circular on leasing and is scheduled to submit them to the \nGovernment in early 2005. The revised decree will contain provisions on methods to deal with \nleased assets in cases of default on lease contracts (policy action subprogram III, B. 1). SBV, \nMOJ, and the Peoples' Supreme Court are involved in discussions on regulations, procedures, \nand methods to deal with leased assets in the case of default.  \n \n45. \nTo promote public awareness of leasing, as well as capacity building for those engaged \nin leasing, conferences with leasing professionals from other developing countries were held in \nHanoi and HCMC on 25 and 27 August 2004, respectively. The conferences were successful in \npromoting better public awareness of leasing, as well as in demonstrating SBV's commitment to \ndeveloping the sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nMoney and Capital Markets \n\n46. \nFSPL  II  also  supports  development  of  the  money  and  capital  markets.  The  overall \ndevelopment  of  the  two  markets  was  constrained  by  slower-than-expected  progress  in  SOCB \nand  SOE  restructuring.  Nevertheless,  steady  progress  was  made  during  subprogram  I  in \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\na. \n\nInterbank and Money Market \n\nimplementing the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks for expanding the role of the two \nmarkets within the financial sector. \n \n \n \n47. \nFSPL  II  supports  the  Government's  initiative  to  develop  the  interbank  and  money \nmarkets by focusing on (i) deregulating interest rates, (ii) developing money market instruments, \n(iii)  improving  the  market  structure,  and  (iv)  enhancing  the  treasury  function  and  capacity  of \nSOCBs.  Availability  of  money  market  instruments  has  increased  as  a  result  of  a  regulation \nallowing the issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit (a first tranche release condition under \nsubprogram  I),  regularized  issuance  of  short-term  treasury  bills  by  MOF  and  issuance  of \nregulations on repurchase agreements (second tranche release conditions under subprogram I, \nparas. 23-25). \n \n48. \nTo further develop money market instruments, FSPL II also supports an integrated legal \nframework  that  will  allow  for  growth  and  innovation,  and  proposes  adoption  of  a  negotiable \ninstruments  law  (policy  actions  subprogram  II,  C.  2,  and  subprogram  III,  C.  1).  With  technical \ninputs  from  ADB  consultants  engaged  under  TA4035-VIE,  the  first  draft  of  the  negotiable \ninstruments  law  was  completed  and  the  draft  is  currently  under  review  by  the  steering \ncommittee  that  was  established  on  2  April  2004  for  that  purpose.  The  committee  comprises \nrepresentatives from SBV, MOF, the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), MOJ, and the \nGovernment's  Office.  The  draft  law  is  scheduled  for  submission  to  the  National  Assembly  for \ndeliberation  in  2006.  Progress  outside  of  FSPL  II  includes  successful  completion  of  the  first \nphase of a World-Bank-funded project on modernizing the banking and payment systems. The \nsystem  created  the  foundation  for  a  national  payment  system,  integral  for  development  of  the \ninterbank and money markets. \n \n\nb. \n\nCapital Market \n\n49. \nDevelopment  objectives  for  the  capital  market  component  of  FSPL  II  include  (i) \nbroadening  the  capital  market  base,  (ii)  establishing  a  consolidated  regulatory  framework  and \nmarket surveillance system (paras. 28-31, and 90), (iii) developing institutional investors (paras. \n31  and  71),  (iv)  developing  self-regulatory  organizations  (para.  72),  and  (v)  enhancing  market \nmicrostructure. Solid steps forward were taken in all five areas during FSPL II\u2014subprogram I.  \n \n50. \nIn order to broaden the capital market base, FSPL II supports measures to link the SOE \nequitization program and STC listing through adoption of a list of SOEs as candidates for listing \n(policy action subprogram II, D. 1). In 2003 the Steering Committee on Enterprise Reform and \nDevelopment (SCERD) prepared a list of 2,000 SOEs to be equitized during the next 3 years. \nThe  Government  approved  the  list  at  the  end  of  2003.  Among  those  listed,  230  SOEs  have \nbeen identified as having chartered capital above D10 billion, thus meeting one qualification for \nlisting.  Furthermore,  MOF  is  revising  Decree  64  on  equitization,  providing  tax  incentives  for \nlisting to SOEs undergoing equitization.  \n \nFSPL II also supports a trading board for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \n51. \nto  further  broaden  the  capital  market  (policy  action  subprogram  II,  D.  2).  The  prime  minister \ngave approval to open the Hanoi STC for SMEs in 2002. Subsequently, SSC Chairman issued \nDecision  329/QD-UBCK  on  17  December  2003  on  the  functions,  duties,  powers,  and \norganization of the Hanoi STC and on 17 June 2004, MOF approved implementing guidelines \nfor the operation of the Hanoi STC. Candidates for listing will have registered capital of D5-30 \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nbillion. The official opening of the Hanoi STC is scheduled for 2005 and as of September 2004 \napproximately 10 companies have been identified for listing.3  \n \n52.  Measures  taken  to  enhance  market  structure  during  subprogram  I  implementation \ninclude progress in establishing a centralized depository and an automated clearing/settlement \nsystem.  In  April  2004,  the  SSC  finalized  an  Information  Technology  (IT)  Master  Plan,  which \nincludes  the  depository  and  clearing/settlement  systems.  The  IT  Master  Plan  also  includes  an \nautomated surveillance system as well as a circuit breaker system based on market index. Full \nimplementation of the IT system is scheduled for 2007. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Infrastructure \n\nFSPL  II  includes  four  components  under  financial  infrastructure  development  (i) \n53. \nstrengthening  the  accounting  and  auditing  system,  (ii)  implementing  the  registry  for  secured \ntransactions  system,  (iii)  strengthening  the  deposit  insurance  system,  and  (iv)  developing  the \nanti-money-laundering regime. \n \n\na. \n\nAccounting and Auditing System \n\n54. \nThe  accounting  and  auditing  system  is  widely  recognized  as  the  key  financial \ninfrastructure,  largely  determining  the  soundness  and  efficiency  of  a  market-based  financial \nsystem. This component of FSPL II seeks to (i) establish accounting enforcement mechanisms, \nand  (ii)  develop  a  competitive  accounting  industry.  The  Accounting  Law  passed  on  17  June \n2003 and Decrees 128 and 129 issued on 31 May 2004, providing guidelines on the Accounting \nLaw, brings accounting practices significantly closer to international standards. Decree 105 on \nIndependent Audit,4 issued on 30 March 2004, stipulates that all banks, insurance companies, \nlisted firms, SOEs, foreign invested enterprises, and nationally important Group A projects must \nbe audited by independent auditors who are fully liable for their work. Furthermore, the decree \nbans establishment of any new state-owned auditing companies and requires all currently state-\nowned auditing companies and joint stock companies operating under the Enterprise Law to be \nconverted  into  partnerships,  private  firms,  or  foreign-invested  companies.  The  decree  became \neffective on 14 April 2004. \n \n\nb. \n\nSecured Transactions System \n\nThe  Government  has  made  steady  progress \n\n55. \ntoward  developing  a  nationwide, \ncomputerized  secured  transactions  registration  system.  In  2002,  registration  centers  for  asset \ntransactions were established in Hanoi and HCMC. MOJ is preparing to open a Danang office \nby end 2004. During 10 months of operations in 2003, the Hanoi registration center had 6,043 \napplications  to  register  assets,  and  HCMC  had  6,047  applications.  In  the  6  months  starting \nJanuary 2004, the two centers had 4,674 and 4,423 applications, respectively. Some procedural \nissues  need  to  be  addressed,  but  pilot  testing  at  the  two  registration  centers  has  been \nsuccessful.  A  feasibility  study  of  the  nationwide  computerized  registration  system  was \ncompleted  and  submitted  to  the  Minister  of  Justice  in  July  2004.  Following  approval  of  the \nfeasibility  study,  building  a  networked,  and  computerized,  nationwide  secured  transactions \nregistration system will begin in 2005. \n                                                 \n3  The Hanoi Securities Trading Center is currently designed as a board for small- and medium-sized enterprises to \nbecome  an  over-the-counter  board  in  2007.  A  Ministry  of  Finance  circular  says  that  companies  may  list  on  the \nHanoi  STC  if  they  have  capital  between  VND5-30  billion,  while  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  STC's  minimum  capital \nrequirement will be raised to VND30 billion. \n\n4   The decree replaces Decree 7 of 1994. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\nFor the system to function smoothly, interministerial coordination needs to improve. The \n56. \nprime  minister  issued  Directive  21-2003-CT-TTG  on  2  October  2004  to  direct  government \nministries  and  agencies  involved  in  registration  of  secured  transactions  to  resolve  several \npending  issues.  Included  are  (i)  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  on  secured \ntransactions for register of immovable properties, (ii) Ministry of Transport and Communication \nfor  registration  of  aircraft  and  ships  for  secured  transactions,  (iii)  Ministry  of  Interior  for  the \nposition of registrar at the registration offices, and (iv) SBV on compliance by credit institutions \nwhen  providing  loans  secured  by  registered  assets.  The  drafting  of  the  ordinance  for  secured \ntransactions\u2014submission  of  which  to  the  National  Assembly  is  a  FSPL  II  policy  action \n(subprogram III, E-2. 2)\u2014has begun. The ordinance will contain all procedural matters related to \nsecured  transactions,  while  the  civil  code,  currently  being  revised,  will  cover  all  substantive \nmatters.  The  third  draft  of  the  ordinance  was  produced  and  consultations  with  stakeholders \nbegun  during  subprogram  I.  The  National  Assembly\u2019s  deliberation  on  the  ordinance,  however, \nhas been delayed to 2005 due to the full legislative schedule of the National Assembly. \n \n\nc. \n\nDeposit Insurance System \n\n57. \nDIV officially became operational in July 2000 under Decision 218 QD/TTg issued by the \nPrime  Minister  on  9  November  1999.  DIV  has  the  mandate  to  (i)  protect  the  legal  interest  of \nsmall depositors, (ii) contribute to maintaining the stability of credit institutions, and (iii) ensure \nthe  safe  and  sound  development  of  the  banking  business.  As  of  May  2004,  DIV  had  paid  out \nD14,067 billion to 1,353 depositors of 32 failed people's credit funds.  \n \n58. \nPolicy  actions  supported  under  FSPL  II  include  measures  to  (i)  address  moral  hazard \nproblems  by  specifying  strict  conditions  under  which  DIV  can  provide  financial  support  to \nproblem  banks  (policy  action  subprogram  II,  E-3.  8),  and  (ii)  legally  empower  DIV  to  finance \nfrom  outside  sources  the  payout  for  depositors  in  cases  of  large  failures  and  charge  different \npremiums in accordance to distinct categories of credit institutions being covered (policy action \nsubprogram II, E-3. 7). DIV management reviewed its operations 3 years after establishment in \n2004  and  identified  eleven  policy  changes  needed,  including  policy  actions  supported  under \nFSPL II. The process of revising the decree on deposit insurance will begin in 2005. \n  \n\nd. \n\nAnti-money Laundering Regime \n\n59. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  growing  importance  of  the  fight  against  money \nlaundering,  and  there  is  a  rising  interest  in  establishing  an  effective  anti-money-laundering \nregime. Of critical importance are measures to (i) enhance awareness of anti-money-laundering \nactivities  within  the  Government  and  private  businesses,  (ii)  establish  the  legal  and  regulatory \nbasis  for  combating  money  laundering,  and  (iii)  devise  systems  for  reporting  suspicious \ntransactions.  SBV  and  MOJ  have  sent  representatives  to  observe  meetings  held  by  the  Asia \nPacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)5 in the past. Government representatives were also \npresent at the 2003 and 2004 APG annual meetings. \n \n60. \nThe  process  of  establishing  an  anti-money-laundering  regime  in  Viet  Nam  began  with \nthe  drafting  of  an  anti-money-laundering  decree  with  SBV  as  the  lead  agency.  The  draft  was \npresented  for  discussion  among  all  ministries  and  government  agencies  concerned  in  a \nroundtable  discussion  held  28-29  August  2002.  After  official  comments  from  government \n                                                 \n5   The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering  was established in 1997 to facilitate the adoption, implementation, \nand  enforcement  of \nthe  40 \nrecommendations  and  8  special  recommendations  on  terrorist  financing  of  the  Financial  Actions  Task  Force  on \nMoney Laundering. Currently, it has 28 members and ADB is an observer international organization. \n\ninternationally  accepted  anti-money \n\nlaundering  standards  as  set  out \n\nin \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nministries and agencies, and appraisal by MOJ, the draft decree was submitted to the Standing \nCommittee of the National Assembly on 21 May 2004, thereby fulfilling a subprogram I second \ntranche release condition. The decree contains the essential elements required for an effective \nanti-money-laundering  regime,  including  provisions  for  (i)  customer  identification  by  financial \ninstitutions, (ii) reporting of suspicious transactions, (iii) functions of the financial intelligence unit \nand  (iv)  international  cooperation  to  fight  money  laundering.  ADB  will  continue  to  provide \ntechnical input for establishing the financial intelligence unit, as stipulated in the Decree on Anti-\nmoney Laundering through TA4290-VIE.  \n \nC. \n\nPerformance Monitoring \n\nTo  facilitate  performance  monitoring,  baseline  data  was  collected  for  each  subsector. \n\n61. \nKey data is below: \n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Performance Monitoring Baseline Data \n\n  \u2013 Non-life (D billion) \n\nPerformance Data \nM2/GDP (%) \nTotal financial assets/GDP (%) \nGross insurance premiums  \u2013 Life (D billion)  \n \nInsurers \u2013 State-owned (D billion) \n \n \u2013 Private (D billion) \nTotal Premium (% of GDP) \nState-owned Insurers (% of total) \nPrivate Insurers (% of total) \nTotal value of lease contracts outstanding (D billion) \nTotal money market transactions \nSTC market capitalization (D billion) \nSTC turnover (D billion) \n\n2002 \n64 \n74 \n4,368  \n 2,624  \n 4,265  \n 2,727  \n1.3 \n61 \n39 \n2,770 \n\u2013\u2013 \n2,539 \n1,083 \n\n \n\n2003 \n67 \n84 \n 6,317  \n3,875 \n5,868 \n4,632 \n1.8 \n56 \n44 \n3,980 \n\u2013\u2013 \n2,405 \n2,998  \n\n\u2013\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = money supply, STC = Securities Trading Center. \nSources: Ministry of Finance, State Bank Of Viet Nam, And State Securities Commission. \n\n \n62. \nDuring  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I  implementation,  the  insurance  sector  experienced \nimpressive  growth,  averaging  over  40%  growth  per  annum  in  total  premiums  earned  during \n2001-2003. As of December 2003, there were 24 licensed insurance companies in Viet Nam: 4 \nstate-owned  insurers,  7  joint-stock  companies,  7  joint  ventures,  and  6  wholly-foreign-owned \ncompanies.  Total  capital  of  the  insurance  companies  amounted  to  D1,715  billion  in  2001, \nD1,900  billion  in  2002  and  D2,269  billion  in  2003.  The  total  insurance  premiums  amounted  to \nD4,982 billion in 2001, D6,632 billion in 2002, and D10,192 billion in 2003. Insurance premiums \nfor life insurance policies were D2,793 billion in 2001, D4,368 billion in 2002 and D6,317 billion \nin 2003. Insurance premiums for non-life insurance policies were D2,189 billion in 2001, D 2,624 \nbillion in 2002, and D3,875 billion in 2003.  \n \n63. \nAt  present  there  are  eight  financial  leasing  companies\u2014five  state-owned,  one  joint \nventure, and two wholly-owned foreign leasing companies\u2014operating in Viet Nam. Total assets \nof the leasing companies amounted to D1,950 billion in 2001, D3,120 billion in 2002 and D4,360 \nin  2003.  The  total  amount  of  lease  contracts  outstanding  amounted  to  D1,630  billion  in  2001, \nD2,770  billion in 2002, and D3,980 billion in 2003.  Leasing companies\u2019 high asset growth has \nprompted all leasing companies to apply for an increase in chartered capital in 2004. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nTo  date,  the  money  market  transactions  have  been  limited  to  trade  in  valuable  papers \n64. \nbetween  SBV  and  credit  institutions  as  a  monetary  policy  tool.  Secondary  market  trading \nvolumes  for  valuable  papers  have  been  insignificant.  Trading  between  SBV  and  the  credit \ninstitutions  through  open  market  operations  amounted  to  a  total  of  D21,184  billion  in  2003. \nDecision 477 issued on 28 April 2004, replacing Decision 516, will require that credit institutions \nreport trading volumes of valuable papers in the secondary market as of 1 January 2005. This \nwill allow SBV to better track money market transactions between credit institutions. \n \nThe  capital  market,  on  the  other  hand,  is  experiencing  steady  expansion.  As  of  May \n65. \n2004, the HCMC STC had 24 listed companies, with total market capitalization of D3,906 billion. \nAlso as of May 2004, the total value of government bonds and corporate bonds listed stood at \nD16,472  billion  and  D157.7  billion, respectively.  The  daily  turnover  for  each  trading  session is \nD12.1  billion.  There  are  currently  13  securities  firms  in  Viet  Nam  with  total  capital  of  D605.73 \nbillion and 1 licensed investment fund with a total value of D300 billion.  \n \n66. \nAvailable data shows that the financial subsectors being supported under FSPL II, with \nthe exception of the money market, are experiencing solid growth. Although it is still too early for \nassessments, the program objective to develop alternative channels of financial intermediation \nappears  to  be  on  track.  Performance  of  each  subsector  will  continue  to  be  closely  monitored \nand relevant data compiled throughout FSPL II implementation. \n \nD. \n\nConclusion on Implementation of Subprogram I \n\n67. \nThe implementing agencies' commitment to complete FSPL II\u2014subprogram I was visible \nin the steady progress made toward fulfilling all policy actions throughout implementation. Of the \n17  second  tranche  release  conditions,  15  are  fully  met  and  2  substantially  met,  with  ongoing \ncompliance.  Quality  of  outputs  under  subprogram  I  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  The \ncapacity to implement reforms varied, however, and periodic shortages of qualified staff caused \ndelays in the reform agenda. Capacity of implementing agencies is being developed under the \ntwo  TAs  and  it  is  assessed  that  with  strong  commitment  to  continue  with  the  reform  program, \nthe Government is ready to proceed to FSPL II\u2014subprogram II. Moreover, there is momentum \nbuilding in undertaking reform measures within the financial sector components covered under \nFSPL  II  and  continuing  with  FSPL  II\u2013\u2013subprogram  II  without  interruption  will  be  important  for \nachieving program objectives. In view of the significant progress made in the implementation of \nthe overall Program and the substantial compliance with the second tranche conditions, release \nof the second tranche of the FSPL II\u2013\u2013subprogram I is justified. \n \n\nV. \n\nFSPL II SUBPROGRAM II\u2014PROPOSED LOAN \n\nA. \n\nProgress in Policy Actions under Subprograms II and III \n\n68. \nThe  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  reform  by  taking  advanced \nactions in a number of key areas. These are discussed below. Details of the progress with all \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II and III policy actions are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n1. \n\nInsurance Sector  \n\n69. \nFSPL II proposed MOF to develop and apply an early warning system to detect risks of \nfailure  at  insurance  companies  by  reviewing  operations  and  financial  positions  (policy  action \nsubprogram  II,  A.  4).  With  the  assistance  and  technical  inputs  from  experts  engaged  under \nTA4035-VIE,  the  early  warning  system  was  developed  and  issued  on  27  September  2003  as \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nDecision  153:  System  Monitoring  Indicators.  To  build  the  overall  capacity  of  insurance \nprofessionals,  MOF  was  to  establish  an  insurance  department  in  the  Finance  Institute  (policy \naction subprogram II, A. 6). MOF has combined subdepartments of the Finance Institute into a \nBanking  and  Insurance  Department,  currently  offering  a  4-year  insurance  training  program. \nMOF trainers for the insurance program are being trained with support from AFD.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLeasing Sector  \n\nFSPL II identified regulatory and administrative gaps to be addressed for developing an \n70. \nenabling  business  environment  for  the  leasing  sector.  A  major  gap  was  that  the  leasing \ncompanies  were  only  able  to  engage  in  financial  leasing.  FSPL  II  proposed  that  SBV  issue  a \nregulation  allowing  leasing  companies  to  provide  both  finance  and  operating  leases  (policy \naction subprogram II, B. 1). SBV issued a regulation to allow operating leases on 15 June 2004. \nSBV intends to further strengthen the legal framework of the leasing sector by revising Decree \n16, governing the leasing industry, in which operating and financial leases will be both covered \nas the main activities of leasing companies. \n \n\n3. \n\nCapital Market \n\n71. \nIn  order  to  foster  the  capital  market,  FSPL  II  supported  the  establishment  of  a  trading \nboard  for  SMEs  and  developing  institutional  investors  in  Viet  Nam.  Specifically,  FSPL  II \nproposed that (i) SSC to approve a trading board for SMEs in Hanoi (policy action subprogram II, \nD.  2),  and  (ii)  the  Government  to  issue  the  amended  Decree  48  including  regulations  on \nestablishment  of  securities  investment  funds  (policy  action  subprogram  II,  D.  4).  The  policy \naction to approve a trading board for SMEs in Hanoi was also specified as a trigger condition for \nprocessing  subprogram  II.  Both  policy  conditions  have  been  met.  The  MOF,  on  behalf  of  the \nSSC, issued an implementing circular on 17 June 2004 detailing the operational design of the \nHanoi STC. So far, SSC has a preliminary list of 10 SMEs that may list on the Hanoi STC. The \nGovernment  also  issued  Decree  144,  a  revision  of  Decree  48,  on  28  November  2003.  It \nincludes  provisions  for  (i)  participation  in  an  investment  fund,  (ii)  form  of  investment  fund,  (iii) \nestablishment  of  an  investment  fund,  (iv)  application  documents  and  a  timeframe  for  granting \nlicenses  for  establishment  of  an  investment  fund,  (v)  dissolution  of  an  investment  fund,  (vi) \ninvestment  fund  board,  (vii)  a  custodian  bank,  and  (viii)  operational  principles  of  a  fund \nmanagement company. Subsequently, the SSC licensed Vietnam Securities Investment Fund to \nbegin operations in March 2004 (policy action subprogram III, D. 2). The closed-end fund has \nmobilized D300 billion, the ceiling as of 20 May 2004.  \n \n72. \nDecree 144 also acknowledges the establishment of a securities association to operate \non  a  voluntary,  self-regulated,  and  self-funded  basis.  Promoting  and  recognizing  a  securities \nindustry  association  is  a  policy  condition  under  FSPL  II  (subprogram  II,  D.  5).  The  Vietnam \nStock  Exchange  Business  Association  was  established  under  Decision  29/QD-BNV,  dated  11 \nJune 2003, by the Minister of Home Affairs. The first general meeting of the Securities Business \nAssociation was held on 17 December 2003. All 14 securities brokers are now members of the \nassociation. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Infrastructure \n\n73. \nFSPL  II  also  proposes  to  strengthen  Vietnam  Accounting  and  Auditing  Association's \n(VAA's)  role  within  the  private  sector,  which  is  constituted  predominantly  of  SMEs.  The \nEnterprise Law of 2000 requires the adoption of the Vietnamese Accounting System, but most \nSMEs  lack  the  capacity  to  adopt  it.  FSPL  II  requires  that  MOF  support  establishment  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\ndevelopment  of  an  accounting  assistance  center  for  SMEs  under  the  VAA  (policy  action \nsubprogram II, E-1. 5). With the support of MOF, an assistance center has been housed within \nthe newly refurbished VAA and 10 training courses are being provided. It is estimated that more \nthan 1,300 SME staff have attended these training courses. \n \n74. \nAlso, at the time FSPL II was being prepared, many accounting firms were owned by the \ngovernment. MOF was both regulator and owner of accounting firms, raising the possibility that \na  competitive  market  could  be  compromised.  Accordingly,  FSPL \nII  supported \nprivatization/equitization  of  state-owned  auditing  firms  (policy  action  subprogram  III,  E-1.  1). \nDuring FSPL II\u2014subprogram I implementation, MOF took steps to equitize several state-owned \nauditing  firms  and  to  change  the  corporate  structure  of  VACO,  the  country\u2019s  largest  auditing \ncompany.  One  state-owned  auditing  firm,  A&C,  was  equitized  in  accordance  with  Decision \n721/QB-BTC of 2 April 2003. The equitization was completed in the fourth quarter of 2003. Two \nothers,  AFC  and  AASC,  are  undergoing \nfor \ntransformation  of  their  ownership.  VACO's  transformation  into  a  one-member  limited  liability \ncompany was endorsed by the MOF under Decision 1927/QD-BTC issued on 30 June 2003 and \nthe auditing firm officially became a one-member limited liability company as of 1 January 2004. \n \nB. \n\nthe  required  administrative  procedures \n\nLessons Learned \n\ntime \n\nImplementing  agencies  required  more \n\nThe Government has shown strong commitment to undertaking policy actions agreed to \n75. \nunder  FSPL  II.  Throughout  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I,  steady  progress  has  been  made  in \nimplementing  the  overall  program  and  fulfilling  the  policy  conditions  in  line  with  program \nobjectives. However, completing policy measures required significantly more time than originally \nto  understand  concepts  and \nenvisioned. \nmechanisms that were new to the country. Furthermore, mandatory consensus building before \nactual  reform  implementation  proved  time-consuming.  Technical  inputs  were  indispensable  in \nenacting rules and regulations such as the anti-money-laundering decree and revised circulars \non  accounting  systems  for  insurance  companies.  The  TAs  ensured  that  best  practices  were \nincorporated  and  consolidated  throughout  the  consultation  period  to  achieve  the  intended \nresults.  \n \nFostering  a  solid  understanding  of  the  underlying  concepts  and  mechanisms  for \n76. \nmodernizing the financial system and ensuring consultation with all stakeholders, including the \nprivate  sector,  are  assessed  as  having  a  long-term  positive  impact  on  the  sustainability  of \nprogram outputs. Given the experience of FSPL II\u2014subprogram I, and specifically the need for \nconsensus building, more time has been allocated to meet specific policy measures for tranche \nreleases under subprogram II, allowing time for consultation particularly with the relevant private \nsector stakeholders. \n \n77.  While  progress  was  good  in  some  areas  of  the  Government's  planned  reforms,  others \nconfronted  formidable  challenges,  such  as  those  related  to  SOCB  and  SOE  restructuring.  For \nexample,  by  mid-2002,  most  interest  rates  had  been  liberalized  and  the  Government's  priority \nshifted  to  developing  the  money  market  by  issuing  short-term  treasury  bills  on  a regular  basis \nand  improving  SOCBs\u2019  treasury  function.  FSPL  II  supports  developing  money  market \ninstruments  such  as  certificates  of  deposit  and  short-term  treasury  bills  and  improving  the \nmarket  structure  by  introducing  money  brokerage  firms  to  penetrate  through  the  segmented \nbanking  sector.  However,  SOCBs\u2019  commercial  orientation  must  significantly  improve  for  active \nsecondary  trade  on  the  money  market  to  take  place.  While  SOCBs'  operational  and \norganizational  restructuring  is  outside  the  scope  of  FSPL  II,  delays  in  banking  sector  reforms \nwere  identified  as  a  risk  factor  at  the  time  of  program  formulation.  This  was  to  be  mitigated \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nthrough  the  comprehensive  reform  package  formulated  with  the  assistance  from  World  Bank \nunder its poverty reduction support credit (PRSC). ADB will continue to consult IMF and World \nBank  on  measures  to  strengthen  SOCBs'  commercial  orientation  and  treasury  function  during \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II. ADB's participation in PRSC would have the potential of providing an \neffective platform for developing yet closer cooperation with the World Bank and other bilateral \ndonors involved in banking sector reforms. \n \n78. \nSOE restructuring has also experienced delays, with a number of implications for FSPL \nII.  The  most  prominent  issue  has  been  the  quantity  and  quality  of  companies  listed  on  the \nHCMC  STC.  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  has  two  policy  measures  under  the  capital  market \ncomponent  for  increasing  the  number  of  listed  state-owned  enterprises.  One  policy  measure \ncalls for SCERD, in cooperation with SSC, to issue a list of SOEs that are candidates for listing \n(policy action subprogram II, D. 1). The second policy action requires companies meeting listing \ncriteria  to  disclose  the  same  information  as  listed  companies  in  order  to  prevent  regulatory \narbitrage  (policy  action  subprogram  II,  D.  3).  An  assessment  of  SOE  restructuring  concluded \nthat  proposing  policy  actions  to  complement  the  latest  developments  in  SOE  reform  would  be \nmore  meaningful.  As  consensus  on  the  broad  framework  on  SOE  restructuring  is established, \ntargeting  a  specific  group  of  SOEs  to  move  forward,  and  possibly  to  list,  would  be  more \nrelevant.  The  two  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  policy  actions  relating  to  listing  of  SOEs  and \ndisclosure of information have therefore been refined (paras. 88-90). \n   \nC. \n\nRefined Policy Framework and Actions for Subprogram II \n\n79. \nThe Government requested to combine FSPL II\u2014subprograms II and III (in accordance \nwith paragraph 94 of FSPL II RRP) during the 2004 country programming mission (12-27 April \n2004).  The  request  was  made  on  the  basis  of  (i)  relatively  small  loan  sizes,  and  (ii)  more \ncertainty in completing specific policy actions. \n \nFSPL  II\u2014subprograms  II  and  III  are  proposed  to  be  consolidated  into  a  single \n80. \nsubprogram  with  three  tranches.  In  formulating  the  subprogram,  all  policy  actions  proposed \nunder  the  FSPL  II  cluster  were  discussed  with  the  Government.  Essentially  all  policy  actions \nthat  were  proposed  in  subprograms  II  and  III  have  been  maintained.  (For  details  see \nRefinements under Proposed Subprogram II in Appendix 4.)  \n \n81. \nUnder the insurance component, proposed revisions comprise (i) exclusion of one policy \naction on an approval system for opening new branches and representative offices of insurance \ncompanies,  (ii)  replacing  one  policy  action  for  strengthening  corporate  governance  with  two \npolicy  actions  specifically  addressing  concerns  of  the  current  operations  of  the  insurance \nindustry,  (iii)  adding  one  policy  action  on  strengthening  supervision  and  prudential  regulation, \nand (iv) adding a new policy action on enhancing industry professionals. \n \n82. \nUnder the capital markets component, a policy action for broadening the capital market \nbase and another policy action for establishing a consolidated regulatory framework have been \nrefined  to  better  reflect  developments  in  SOE  restructuring  and  progress  in  the  Government's \nplans to upgrade the legal framework of the capital market.  \n \n83. \nUnder the component for improving the financial infrastructure, minor refinements have \nbeen  made  for  establishing  the  secured  transactions  systems  and  strengthening  the  deposit \ninsurance corporation, taking into account the progress made by the Government and specific \nbottlenecks found during FSPL II\u2014subprogram I implementation. In terms of preventing money \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nlaundering, more specificity have been added to the policy action on establishing the financial \nintelligence unit, reflecting the Government's advanced understanding of the requirements. \n \n84. \nA complete set of reforms to be implemented in FSPL II\u2014subprogram II is in the Policy \nMatrix (Appendix 5). Policy actions that have been refined or added to reflect the Government's \nachievements,  the  evolving  policy  environment,  and  lessons  learned  from  subprogram  I \nimplementation are discussed in detail below.  \n \n\n1. \n\nInsurance Sector \n\n85. \nPolicy  actions  under  the  insurance  component  were  revised  to  consider  the  sector\u2019s \ngrowth,  which  has  given  rise  to  the  need  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  and  prudential \nregulations. The policy action proposed for development and introduction of an approval system \nfor  opening  new  branches  and  representative  offices  of  insurance  companies  and  insurance \nbrokers (policy action subprogram II, A. 1) was sufficiently covered under the revised Circular 71 \nand is excluded from the newly formulated FSPL II\u2014subprogram II.   \n \n86. \nTo strengthen corporate governance, a policy action requiring MOF to submit a plan to \nthe Government to improve corporate governance, including ownership structure of state-owned \ninsurance companies and joint stock insurance companies (policy action subprogram III, A. 3), \nis replaced by two policy actions. The two new policy actions address specific concerns of the \ncurrent  operations  within  the  insurance  industry.  The  first  is  the  lack  of  reliability  of  annual \naccounts, and the second is the absence of institutional frameworks to monitor and control risks \ninherent to the sector. The newly formulated FSPL II\u2014subprogram II policy actions proposes to \nenhance  corporate  governance  of  insurance  companies  by  MOF  by  (i)  requiring  insurance \ncompanies  to  have  the  annual  accounts  cosigned  by  an  MOF  authorized  auditor;  and  (ii) \nrecommending that insurance companies adopt compliance manuals and establish compliance \ncommittees,  audit  committees,  and  risk  management  committees  by  holding  seminars, \nworkshops, and publishing reference materials on MOF\u2019s web site. \n \n87. \nTo strengthen supervision and prudential regulations, a policy condition has been added \nencouraging MOF to introduce regulations requiring signoff of reserves in the annual accounts \nby  an  actuary  approved  by  MOF.  A  policy  action  mandating  that  at  least  50%  of  MOF\u2019s \nInsurance Department staff complete insurance-related courses at the Finance Institute or other \nMOF-recognized institutes is now included under FSPL II\u2014subprogram II. \n \n\n2. \n\nCapital Market \n\n88. \nTwo  policy  actions  under  the  capital  markets  component  have  been  refined  to  ensure \nthat concrete actions are taken toward meeting the program objectives of broadening the capital \nmarket  base  and  establishing  a  consolidated  regulatory  framework.  The  two  original  policy \nactions are (i) the SCERD, in cooperation with SSC, issue a list of SOEs that are candidates for \nlisting  (policy  action  subprogram  II,  D.1);  and  (ii)  MPI,  together  with  SSC,  require  joint-stock \ncompanies  that  meet  listing  requirements  to  disclose  the  same  information  as  the  listed \ncompanies to the National Business Information Center (policy action subprogram II, D.3).  \n \n89. \nSCERD has prepared a list of more than 200 companies with registered capital of more \nthan  D10  billion  as  candidates  for  listing,  but  whether  these  companies  will  actually  list  is \nuncertain.  The  Government  has  prepared  concrete  plans  for  SOE  equitization.  However,  the \noption  to  list  must  be  considered  by  the  SOEs  themselves  in  the  process  of  equitization, \nparticularly  large  SOEs  with  the  potential  to  benefit  from  listing.  To  make  listing  attractive  for \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nSOEs,  the  newly  formulated  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  requires  that  SSC,  in  cooperation  with \nMOF, revise Decree 64 on SOE equitization to provide incentives for equitizing SOEs to list. \n \n90. \nFurthermore,  to  consolidate  the  regulatory  framework  and  surveillance  system,  SSC \nplans to draft a securities and exchange law for submission to the National Assembly in 2007. \nEnactment  of  a  securities  and  exchange  law  is  a  welcome  move  given  the  capital  markets\u2019 \nfragmented legal framework and the limited effectiveness of a decree as a legal basis for capital \nmarket  operations.  SSC  is  expected  to  be  given  more  concrete  legal  power  to  undertake \nsupervision,  surveillance,  and  enforcement  of  laws  over  the  securities  market.  To  support  the \nSSC in this endeavor, FSPL II\u2014subprogram II includes a policy action to draft and submit the \nsecurities  and  exchange  law  to  the  Government  which  would  include  (i)  corporate  disclosure \nrequirements;  and  (ii)  supervisory,  investigation,  surveillance,  and  enforcement  mechanisms. \nDisincentives  for  listing  on  the  HCMC  STC,  such  as  requiring  substantially  more  corporate \ndisclosure  than  unlisted  companies,  will  be  addressed  in  a  comprehensive  manner  under  the \nsecurities and exchange law. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Infrastructure \n\na. \n\nSecured Transactions System \n\n91.  MOJ  was  to  continue  implementing  the  registry  of  secured  transactions  in  three  other \nprovinces  and  cities  under  central  management  on  the  basis  of  a  centralized,  and  networked \nregistration  system.  It  was  also  tasked  with  building  a  national  database  system  for  secured \ntransactions  (policy  action  subprogram  II,  E-2.  6).  FSPL  II  also  supports  MOJ  in  submitting  a \ndraft law or ordinance on registration of secured transactions to the National Assembly (policy \naction subprogram III, E-2, 2). The Government has determined that an ordinance will be issued \nfor secured transactions, incorporating all procedural matters related to registration of secured \ntransactions. Rather than continuing with registration system expansion, it is important for MOJ \nto  take  stock  of  all  activities  of  current  registries  to  improve  the  system  and  ensure  that  the \nordinance  submitted  in  2005  supports  those  improvements.  Accordingly,  the  two  conditions \nwere  revised  as  follows:  (i)  MOJ  to  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  on  the  experience  of \noperating registries and list specific measures for increasing the use of the registration system; \nand (ii) MOJ to submit a draft ordinance on registration of secured transactions to the Standing \nCommittee of the National Assembly, containing all procedural requirements for registration. \n \n\nb. \n\nDeposit Insurance \n\n92. \nFSPL II also revisits the issue of phasing out people's credit funds from DIV coverage. \nThe  original  policy  condition  required  the  Government  to  consider  revising  the  Decree  on \nDeposit  Insurance  to  gradually  remove  people's  credit  funds  from  DIV  coverage  once  the \nsystem safety fund, which will serve to cover depositors of failed people's credit funds, is fully \noperational  (policy  action  subprogram  III,  E-3.  3).  However,  little  progress  has  been  made  in \nestablishing and operationalizing the system safety funds. Both DIV and SBV stressed the need \nto conduct a more detailed and pragmatic study on the different models before proceeding with \nthe establishment of the system safety fund. Given the importance of this issue and the need for \ncareful planning, the newly formulated FSPL II\u2014subprogram II sequences measures to phase \nout  people's  credit  funds  in  two  steps:  (i)  to  complete  a  feasibility  study  for  determining  the \nappropriate  model  for  depositor  protection  in  people's  credit  funds  (subprogram  II  second \ntranche  release  condition),  and  (ii)  the  Government  to  approve  a  funded  system  for  depositor \nprotection in people's credit funds (subprogram II third tranche release condition). \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nc. \n\nAnti-money Laundering  \n\n93. \nSubsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Decree,  it  was  agreed  that \nconcrete  steps  should  be  taken  to  establish  a  financial  intelligence  unit.  Two  conditions  were \nadded  to  strengthen  the  anti-money-laundering  component,  specifically  for  the  purposes  of \nestablishing and operationalizing the financial intelligence unit. The newly formulated FSPL II\u2014\nsubprogram  II  supports  the  Government  in  establishing  and  operationalizing  the  financial \nintelligence unit with adequate staffing and internal procedures. The compliance programs will \nbe developed in consultation with the private sector.  \n \n94. \nFurthermore,  the  policy  action  to  join  an  international  organization  for  anti-money-\nlaundering  activities  was  upgraded  to  require  full  membership  rather  than  observer  status. \nJoining APG will help Viet Nam gain recognition from the international community as a country \nwith  a  firm  commitment  to  fighting  money  laundering  and  financing  of  terrorism.  Viet  Nam  will \nalso benefit from the contacts, information, and training provided through such an organization. \n \nD. \n\nSubprogram II Loan Amount and Tranches \n\n95. \nThe proposed loan for FSPL II\u2014subprogram II will comprise an ADB loan of $35 million \nequivalent from ADF. Subprogram II will be released in three tranches: (i) $10 million equivalent \nfrom ADF upon compliance with the first tranche conditions, (ii) $15 million equivalent from ADF \nsubject to fulfillment of second tranche release conditions, and (iii) $10 million equivalent from \nADF  subject  to  completion  of  third  tranche  release  conditions.  The  implementation  period  for \nsubprogram II is proposed to be 24 months. The first tranche is expected to be released after 6 \nmonths  from  loan  effectiveness.  Completion  of  policy  actions  for  second  and  third  tranche \nrelease is expected within 18 and 24 months, respectively, from loan effectiveness. \n \n96. \nAFD has proposed to cofinance \u20ac35 million for FSPL II: \u20ac23 million for subprogram I and \n\u20ac12 million for subprogram II. AFD will disburse subprogram II in tranches simultaneously with \nADB disbursements, on the same schedule and conditions. The proceeds will be disbursed to a \nspecial account and will be used to finance costs of projects, which are directly linked to reforms \nin  the  financial  sector,  6  according  to  procedures  defined  between  AFD  and  the  Government. \nThe  details  of  the  cofinancing  arrangement  have  been  finalized  under  a  separate  loan \nagreement between the Government and AFD. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangement \n\n97. \nImplementation  arrangements  adopted  for  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I  have  been  effective. \nThe procedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds \nfor subprogram II, will be the same as for subprogram I. With respect to fiduciary risk, the World \nthe  Country  Financial \nBank  conducted  a  comprehensive  assessment  and  produced \nAccountability  Assessment  (CFAA)  dated  15  October  2001.7  Following  the  CFAA,  the  World \nBank  has  provided  a  PRSC,  one  aspect  of  which  is  to  finance  a  public  financial  management \n\n                                                 \n6  The projects that have been identified thus far include the establishment of the Hanoi STC, training the insurance \nsector professionals at the Finance Institute, support for future financial intelligence unit, the purchase of equipment \nfor  the  transaction  center  for  money  market  operations  at  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam,  and  support  for  the \nimplementation of the secured transactions system under the Ministry of Justice.  \n\n7   Country Financial Accountability Assessment indicated that there is a certain degree of fiduciary risk in the use of \npublic  resources,  given  that  the  budget  process  is  not  yet  transparent,  public  access  to  government  financial \ninformation is limited, and effective legislative oversight is not fully in place. \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nsystem.  The  PRSC  is  currently  under  implementation  and  the  Government  is  taking  steps  to \nimprove the transparency of the budget process.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n98. \nSBV will continue to be the Executing Agency for FSPL II\u2014subprogram II. SBV, MOF, \nMPI,  MOJ,  SSC,  and  DIV  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  SBV  will  continue  to  be \nresponsible for the overall program implementation, including administration and disbursement \nof loan proceeds, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of semiannual progress reports. \n \n99. \nA program steering committee (PSC) was formed to coordinate program implementation \namong  government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned.  The  PSC  is  chaired  by  the  deputy \ngovernor  of  SBV  and  comprises  senior  officers,  duly  empowered  to  make  decisions  on \nsubprogram II implementation, from ministries and government agencies including SBV, MOF, \nMPI, MOJ, SSC, and DIV. The program implementation and coordination unit has been formed \nwithin  SBV,  headed  by  a  senior  officer  of  SBV,  and  staffed  with  SBV  officials  with  sufficient \nknowledge and capacity to assist the PSC and ADB. The unit will continue to be responsible for \nday-to-day implementation of subprogram II.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMonitoring \n\n100.  ADB, jointly with AFD and in cooperation with SBV, MOF, MPI, MOJ, SSC, and DIV, has \nfielded semiannual reviews to monitor the progress in FSPL II implementation and assess the \nimpact on the structure and development of the financial sector. ADB jointly with AFD and the \nimplementing agencies will continue to conduct semiannual reviews to ascertain the progress in \nFSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  implementation  and  in  particular  to  confirm  compliance  with  tranche \nrelease  conditions.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  AFD  will  continue  to  engage  in  active  policy \ndialogue  on  sector  issues,  reforms,  and  other  measures  and  advice  on  actions  to  maintain \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II on course.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \n101. \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard \npublic  procedures  in  Viet  Nam  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to \nADB.8  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  markets  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \n102.  The  proceeds  of  the  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  will  be  disbursed  for  a  broad  range  of \nimports, except for a list of ineligible items (Appendix 6). The Borrower will certify that the value \nof  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii) \ndisbursements  made  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount \nexpected  to  be  disbursed  during  the  year.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 1998.

The  disbursement  of  three  tranches  under  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  is  subject  to \nfulfillment  of  specified  first,  second,  and  third  tranche  release  conditions  and  satisfactory \ncompliance with the overall program, as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 5).  \n \n\nVII. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION \n\n105. \nIn  view  of  the  substantial  progress  made  in  the  implementation  of  subprogram  I  and \nsubstantial  compliance  with  each  of  the  17  conditions  for  release  of  the  second  tranche  of \nsubprogram I, I, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of \nthe  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  have  authorized  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  the \nSecond  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan\u2013\u2013subprogram  I.  Accordingly,  in  accordance  with  the \nestablished  procedure,  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  will  be  effected  not  less  than  10 \nworking days after the circulation of this report. \n \n106. \nI am also satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  23,766,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \nNam for subprogram II of the Financial Sector Program Loan Cluster, from ADB's special funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         Vice-President \n\nJoseph B.

The benefits of FSPL II\u2014including broader access to financial services and a more \ncompetitive,  diversified  financial  sector  that  reduces  systemic  vulnerabilities\u2014are  expected  to  become  substantive \nwith the concomitant growth  of subsectors  such as insurance and leasing. Beneficiaries are expected to include the \npoor  and  near-poor.  A  broader  and  more  balanced  financial  system  will  have  higher  resilience  to  external  shocks, \nwhich have serious implications for the poor. \n\nB.

The Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) to adopt a simple \nand transparent \n\u201capproval system\u201d for \nchanges in the operation \nof insurance companies. \n\n STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION  \nSUBPROGRAM I SECOND TRANCHE RELEASE POLICY ACTIONS \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\nComplied with. \n\nThe approval procedures have been specified in Circular 71. \n(Article 5 on revisions and amendments of the business license, \nCircular 71 issued on 28 August 2001, providing implementation \nguidelines to Decree 42 issued on 1 August 2001.) MOF, in \nconsultation with insurance companies and the Viet Nam \nInsurance Association, has considered further measures to \nsimplify the approval system for changes in the operation of \ninsurance companies. Revisions to Circular 71 resulted in \nsimplified application procedures for insurance licenses, reduced \ntime for new product registration for non-life insurance companies \n(from 2 weeks to 3-5 days), and new product approval procedure \nfor life insurers (from 1-2 months to 21 days). The revised circular \nhas been drafted, undergone consultation with the private sector, \nand has been submitted to the Minister of Finance for approval. \nThe revised circular, Circular 98, was approved by the Minister of \nFinance and issued on 15 October 2004.  \n\nIn 2001, there was only one insurance broker: a joint venture with \nthe state. There were concerns that this might result in an unfairly \nhigh volume of insurance policies referred to state-owned \ninsurance companies. In December 2001, MOF licensed one joint-\nstock insurance broker and in May 2003, MOF issued approval for \nestablishment and license for operation to a French insurance \nbroker (Gras Savoy Insurance Broker). Two other domestic \ninsurance brokers (Dai Viet and Adong) were also given operating \nlicenses. MOF intends to approve operation of several other \ninsurance brokers to better meet the growing demand for \ninsurance. At the same time, efforts are being made to improve \nthe quality of insurance agents to protect consumers from fraud, \nas stipulated under Decree 118-2003-ND-CP. \n\nSubstantially complied with. \n\nMOF recognizes the need to diversify insurance products offered \nin Viet Nam, especially for products in support of agricultural, \nforestry and fisheries activities. MOF has granted several \nincentives to insurers on a case-by-case basis. For example, MOF \nlicensed a French insurance company (Groupama) to establish a \n100% foreign-owned non-life insurance company providing \nagricultural insurance. To encourage development of insurance \noutreach, MOF granted the company a number of preferential \ntreatments, including favorable commission rates for agents and \nexpanded its scope of operation. Actual impact has thus far been \nlimited. \n\nContinued on next page \n\nComplied with. \n\n2.  MOF to continue to grant \nlicenses for insurance \nbrokers, regardless of \nthe ownership form, to \nenhance \ncompetitiveness in the \nbrokerage business. \n\n3.  MOF to specify incentive \nmeasures for insurance \ncompanies to develop \nnew insurance products, \nespecially for products in \nsupport of agricultural, \nforestry, and fisheries \nactivities. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3  \n\n33\n\nSecond Tranche Release \nPolicy Actions \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\n4.  MOF to adopt \n\nComplied with. \n\nprocedures for on-site \ninspection and off-site \nsurveillance for \ninsurance companies. \n\n5.  MOF to adopt \n\nComplied with. \n\naccounting system for \ninsurance companies. \n\n \nGeneral guidelines on incentive measures will need to be \nprepared. Such guidelines, however, will require rigorous actuarial \nstudies and cost/benefit analyses. Support for actuarial studies \nand cost/benefit analyses for agricultural insurance are being \nconsidered under the proposed technical assistance (TA) for \ndeveloping agricultural insurance to be funded by the Cooperation \nFund Support of the Formulation and Implementation of National \nPoverty Reduction Fund and the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund. \n\nMOF had conducted annual onsite inspection and regular off-site \nsurveillance. However, formal procedures were yet to be adopted. \nMOF initiated drafting the procedure and produced the first draft in \nOctober 2002. Feedback on the draft was given from the industry \nand MOF revised the draft. Starting July 2003, an Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) consultant under TA4035-VIE provided \ntechnical inputs into the revised draft procedure to incorporate \nbest practices. MOF has undergone a second round of \nconsultation with the insurance companies and the procedure was \nissued on 28 September 2004. Off-site surveillance incorporates \nprocedures for information gathering, review of insurance \ncompanies' files, financial and operational calculations of basic \nratios, financial and other reviews, and preparation of a report. The \non-site inspection procedures include selection of full-scale or \npartial review, preparation for and arrangement of meetings with \nthe insurance company under inspection, review of internal \ncontrol, underwriting procedures, reinsurance procedures and \ncontracts, price or premium setting, claims handling, reserving \nprocess, discussion of results with the insurance company, \npreparation of a report, and follow-up actions.  \n\nThe existing framework for accounting system for insurance \ncompanies consisted of (i) Decree 42 on a Finance Regime for \nInsurers and Insurance Brokers, (ii) Circular 72 on a Financial \nRegime Applicable to Insurers and Insurance Brokers, and (iii) \nDecision 150/1296 System of Accounts for Insurance Business. \nAn ADB consultant under TA 4035-VIE closely reviewed the \nexisting framework and found gaps that required immediate \nattention. Practices adopted under the framework led to \nsubstantial underreserving by insurance companies and was \nperceived as a major risk in a market experiencing 40% annual \ngrowth rate in premiums received. To correct ongoing practices, \nthe methodologies for calculating claims reserves of unearned \npremiums, outstanding claims, and incurred-but-not-reported \nclaims (IBNR) was aligned to international best practices under the \nrevised Circular 72 drafted and submitted to the Minister of \nFinance for issuance. The circular was issued as Circular 99 on 15 \nContinued on next page \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSecond Tranche Release \nPolicy Actions \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\nOctober 2004. The accounting rules would follow international best \npractices for timing of income recognition for insurance premiums \nand requirement to maintain minimum capital by insurers at all \ntimes.  \n\nMOF will need to adopt a full set of accounting standards for \ninsurance companies\u2014standard practice for many developed \ncountries\u2014given the special features and intricacies relating to \ninsurance products. However, this will only be feasible for the \ninsurance industry after accounting standards have been issued \nfor industries in general. A full set of accounting standards for all \nindustries is scheduled to be completed and issued by the end of \n2005. Consideration should be given on developing a full set of \naccounting standards for insurance companies at that time.  \n\nThe standing committee of the National Assembly adopted the \nnew ordinance for administrative violations in July 2002. The draft \ndecree for sanctions against administrative violations incorporated \nthe required revisions in accordance to the Ordinance and was \nsubmitted to the Government in January 2003. The decree was \nreviewed by the Government and issued as Decree 118-2003-ND-\nCP of the Government on Dealing with Administrative Offences in \nthe Insurance Business. The decree includes breaches of \nlicensing provisions, unauthorized assignment of insurance \ncontracts, unlawful competitive acts, forcing persons to buy \ninsurance or to use insurance or reinsurance broking services, \nbreaching of mandatory capital security deposit and reserve \nrequirements, and breaches of capital investment restrictions and \nsolvency requirements. Under the decree, insurance firms may be \nfined up to D20 million for unlawful competitive acts and D5 million \nfor compelling persons to buy insurance. Subsequently, the MOF \nissued Circular 3-2004-TT-BTC on 12 April 2004 providing \nguidelines for implementation of Decree 118. The circular provides \nguidelines for jurisdiction to impose penalties, application of \nminimum and maximum levels of penalties, procedure for \nimposition of penalties, and coordination between functional \nbodies for imposition of penalties. \n\nSince 1999, insurance companies have been conducting internal \ntraining on actuaries and loss adjusters. In 2002, 20 students \nstarted attending the 3-year program on actuarial science opened \nin Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), which comprises 2 years\u2019 university \ntraining and 1 year\u2019s training overseas. In October 2003, two \nadditional classes opened, one in HCMC and the other in Hanoi. \nAs of April 2004, there were 17 students completing the first year \nof the program and 15 students preparing for a third year training \ncourse in Lyon, France to attend the Institute of Financial Science \nand Insurance at Universit\u00e9 de Lyon.  \n\nContinued on next page \n\n6.

MOF to issue short-term \ntreasury bills with \nmaturity less than 1 \nyear. \n\n10.  SBV to issue a \n\nComplied with. \n\nregulation on interbank \nrepurchase agreement \nof valuable papers in the \nmarket and a \nstandardized repurchase \nagreement contract to be \nused for interbank \ntrading. \n\nAll conditions were met as of October 2003. The banking and \nnonbanking departments of SBV took proactive measures to \nresolve constraints to the leasing sector as follows: \n(i)  General Customs Department issued Circular 07-2001 in July \n\n2001, covering the import code for financial leasing \ncompanies. \n\n(ii)  SBV, in coordination with the General Customs  \n\nDepartment, drafted an official dispatch for customs clearance \nprocedures for importing leased assets. On 28 October 2003, \nthe General Department of Customs issued the Official \nDispatch No.5415/TCHQ-GSQL providing guidance on \ncustom clearance for importing lease assets to provincial and \ncity customs. \n\n(iii)  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  Circular  53/2002/TT-BTC  on  25 \n\nJune 2002 for avoidance of dual registration fees. \n\n(iv)  Ministry of Justice issued the Official Dispatch 1448/TRCC as \nNotarization of Copy of Registration Certificate for recognition \nof notarized copy of vehicle registration.  \n\nComplied with. \n\nAlthough MOF has been issuing short-term treasury bills since \n2000 under Decree 01, the issuance is now held with public \nnotification on a quarterly basis. The treasury issues directions for \nissuance of treasury bills with maturities of 6 months, 9 months, \nand 364 days through SBV. The total amount of treasury bills \nissued in 2002 that had maturities of less than 364 days was \nD7,362 billion. In 2003, that amount rose to D12,806 billion. \n\nSBV\u2019s monetary policy department has completed the draft \nregulation on trading valuable papers among credit institutions and \nclients. The regulation includes provisions on repurchase \nagreements between credit institutions. The regulation was \nsubmitted to the SBV governor for issuance, subsequent to \nconsultation within SBV as well as financial institutions. The \nregulation was issued on 15 October 2004 under Decision \n1325/2004/QD-NHNN. \n\nThe Credit Department of SBV, together with the Bankers' \nAssociation of Viet Nam, prepared the draft standardized \nrepurchase agreement contract to be used for interbank trading \nwith technical inputs from the ADB consultant engaged under \nTA4035-VIE. Subsequent to discussions within SBV and \nworkshops held for financial institutions potentially participating in \nthe repurchase market, the standardized repurchase agreement \ncontract was issued on 13 September 2004 by the Council of the \nBankers\u2019 Association of Viet Nam under Decision 284-QD/HHNH.  \n\nContinued on next page \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSecond Tranche Release \nPolicy Actions \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\nBoth the regulation and standardized contract will become \neffective as of 1 October 2004 to coincide with the effectiveness of \nthe revised Law on Credit Institutions, under which the two legal \ndocuments will be governed.      \n\n11.  SBV to issue a \n\nComplied with. \n\nregulation on brokerage \nactivities. \n\nSBV\u2019s credit department drafted the regulation on brokerage \nactivities, with the assistance of the ADB consultant engaged \nunder TA4035-VIE. In June 2003, an SBV representative went on \na study tour to South Korea to become familiar with the money \nmarket and the role brokers play in it. Subsequent to consultations \nwith the private sector, SBV\u2019s credit department finalized the \nregulation in early 2004 and the SBV governor issued the \nregulation on brokerage activities as Decision 315/2004/QD-\nNHNN on 7 April 2004. The regulation allows licensed credit \ninstitutions to apply for licenses to carry out money brokerage \nactivities, including borrowing, lending, certificates of deposit, \nforeign exchange, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps, and \nforeign exchange options. Brokerages may not charge fees \nexceeding 0.02% of total transaction value. Money brokers are \nexpected to overcome banking sector segmentation and initiate \ntransactions among state-owned, joint stock, and foreign-owned \ncommercial banks. \n\n12.  The State Securities \n\nComplied with. \n\nCommission (SSC) to \nadopt (i) a procedure for \nmarket surveillance, and \n(ii) an inspection \nprocedure for securities \ncompanies. \n\nThe capital markets component of TA4035-VIE started in June \n2003 and gave support to SSC in drafting the procedures for \nmarket surveillance and inspection on securities companies. The \ndraft procedures underwent interdepartmental consultation in \nDecember 2003. In early 2003, SSC finalized the procedures and \nbased on the prime minister\u2019s Decision 271 on regulation and \nsurveillance of the financial sector in 2003, the regulation was \nsubmitted to MOF to be issued as a decision of the Minister of \nFinance. Decision 259/QD-UBCK containing procedures for \nmarket surveillance and Decision 258/QD-UBCK for inspection for \nsecurities companies were issued on 27 September 2004.  \n\n13.  SSC to draft an \n\nComplied with. \n\namendment to Decree \n48 to include regulations \non establishment of \nsecurities investment \nfunds. \n\nDecree 48 on Securities and Securities Markets issued on 11 July \n1998 provide the basic legal framework for the capital market in \nViet Nam. Subsequent to 3 years of operation under Decree 48, \nthe SSC recognized the need for its amendment and initiated \ndrafting of an amended Decree 48. SSC submitted the draft of the \nrevised Decree 48 to the Office of Government on 9 May 2003. \nDecree 144/2003/ND-CP (amended Decree 48) was issued on 28 \nNovember 2004 and its implementing circular, providing guidelines \nfor publishing securities market information was issued on 17 June \n2003. The major changes in the decree include (i) SSC's \n\nContinued on next page \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3  \n\n37\n\nSecond Tranche Release \nPolicy Actions \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\n14.  Ministry of Justice (MOJ) \nto carry out necessary \nactivities to develop a \ncentralized, \ncomputerized, and \nnetworked registration \nsystem for secured \ntransactions and to \ndevelop a national \ndatabase for secured \ntransactions. \n\n15.  MOJ and SBV to review \nregulations on secured \ntransactions and on \nregistration of secured \ntransactions, and to \nensure the consistency \nof current regulations on \nsecured transactions \nand their registration. \n\nexpanded authority to regulate initial public offerings (IPOs); (ii) \nless stringent requirements for listing, particularly for companies to \nbe listed on the board for small- and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs); (iii) new provisions on information disclosure, increased \ncontent, and frequency of information; (iv) rules and requirements \non securities investment funds; and (vi) regulations on M&A.  \n\nComplied with. \n\nThe feasibility study for the project was completed in May 2002. \nMOJ engaged a firm to design the infrastructure required for a \nsecured transactions system, including the establishment of the \ndatabase. Relevant government agencies have been consulted \nand have reviewed the proposed system. The system design has \nbeen revised during this consultative process. The feasibility study \nwas finalized and appraised in accordance with the requirement of \nthe Government. The Minister of Justice approved the feasibility \nstudy on 15 October 2004 under Decision 560/QD-BTP.  \n\nSubstantially complied with. \n\nOn 25 October 2002, the Government issued Decree 85-2002-ND-\nCP to address the discrepancies found between Decrees 165 and \n178. SBV also issued Circular 07-2003-TT-NHNN on Security on \nLoan and Credit on 19 May 2003. The issue of inconsistency \nbetween Decree 165 on Security Transactions and Decree 178 on \nSecurity for Loans Obtained from Credit Institutions was mainly on \nthe use of single item of property as security for multiple \nobligations. While this was allowed under Decree 165, it was \nprohibited under Decree 178 in accordance to the so-called \"one \nlender\" rule. Under Article 11 of Decree 178, a single item of \nproperty could only be used as security for multiple obligations to a \nsingle credit institution and only in cases where (i) the ownership \nrights with respect to the property had been registered and (ii) the \nvalue of the security property exceeded the total value of the \nsecured obligations. \n\nUnder Decree 85, a single item of property can now be used as \nsecurity for multiple obligations for one or multiple credit institutions \nprovided that (i) all secured transactions relating to the single item \nof property are registered at the office for secured transactions, (ii) \nall lenders agree in writing on the appointment of a representative \nto retain the original documentation on the secured property, and \n(iii) the value of the security property exceeds the total value of the \nsecured obligations, unless otherwise provided by law. Circular 07 \nprovides detailed guidelines on the use of a single item of property \nas security for multiple obligations and specifically states that the \norder of priority for payment among credit institutions secured by \nthe same single property will be determined in accordance to the \norder in which the secured transactions were registered in the \nsecured transactions registry. Article 11 of Decree 85 is now \nconsistent with Decree 165. \n\nContinued on next page \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSecond Tranche Release \nPolicy Actions \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\nWhile the major issue has been resolved, inconsistencies remain, \nprincipally because Decree 85 assumes no other lender than \nfinancial institutions. SBV and MOJ are continuing discussions and \nplan to further revise Decree 85 to ensure incorporation of lenders \nother than financial institutions under the Decree. \n\n16.  SBV to issue a \n\nComplied with. \n\nregulation on procedures \nfor SBV/Deposit \nInsurance Corporation of \nViet Nam (DIV) joint on-\nsite inspections for \ncovered institutions. \n\nDIV lacks the technical capacity to undertake on-site inspection of \nthe financial institutions it covers, and would require coordination \nand cooperation with the SBV inspectorate. However, there were \nno prearranged procedures for requesting such cooperation, or for \nSBV fielding on-site inspections at the request of DIV. Subsequent \nto discussions between DIV and SBV\u2019s bank inspectorate division, \nthe SBV governor issued Official Dispatch 329/NHNN-TTr on 5 \nApril 2004, specifying exact steps for DIV requesting SBV for joint \non-site inspection, as well as for the timing of such inspections. \n\n17.  SBV to submit a decree \n\nComplied with. \n\non anti-money-\nlaundering regulation for \nthe consideration of the \nGovernment. \n\nIn July 2002, SBV consulted the National Assembly\u2019s standing \ncommittee on drafting the anti-money-laundering decree. The \nstanding committee approved SBV\u2019s request in November 2002, \nand the prime minister appointed SBV to lead the process. The \nfirst draft was completed in January 2003 and circulated to \nrelevant SBV departments. After consolidating comments, \nstakeholder consultations were undertaken, including with the \nstate-owned commercial banks. Substantial technical inputs were \nalso provided by an ADB consultant engaged under TA4035-VIE. \nSubsequent to series of redrafting, the fifth draft was tabled for \ndiscussion in a workshop held on 28-29 August 2003. Following \ninterministerial discussions, the eighth and final draft was \nsubmitted to the standing committee of the National Assembly on \n21 May 2004. The decree is expected to be issued in 2005. \n\nThe draft decree contains the basic elements for initiating a \nfunctioning anti-money-laundering regime, including (i) customer \nidentification by financial institutions, (ii) reporting of suspicious \ntransactions by financial institutions, (iii) functions of the financial \nintelligence unit, and (iv) international cooperation in the fight \nagainst money laundering. SBV began preparations for the \nfinancial intelligence unit in July 2004. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSTATUS OF FINANCIAL SECTOR PROGRAM LOAN II IMPLEMENTATION \nSUBPROGRAMS II AND III \n \n\nSubprogram/Policy Actions \n\nProgress Made as of October 2004 \n\nInsurance Sector \n\nA. \n\n \n\nSubprogram II \n\n \n\n1.

(Article 5 on Revisions and Amendments of the \nBusiness License, Circular 71 dated 28 August 2001 \nproviding implementing guidelines for Decree 42 dated 1 \nAugust 2001 on Implementing Guidelines for Insurance \nBusiness Law provides a transparent \"approval system\".) \nThe approval system for opening new branches and \nrepresentative offices has undergone consultation with \nthe private sector, including review of specific requests \nfrom insurance companies. Revisions incorporated in \nCircular 71 further streamlined the approval system for \nopening new branches and representative offices. \n\nOn 25 February 2003, MOF issued Decision 23 on \nRules, Tariff and Compulsory Insurance of Civil Liabilities \nof Motor Vehicles Owners. MOF is working on terms and \nconditions for five other types of compulsory insurance, \nincluding fire insurance, but is constrained by the fact \nthat it lacks an appropriate database. Experiences of \nother developing countries in setting up terms and \nconditions of insurance and tariffs for different types of \ncompulsory insurance are under review.

This decree established \na number of new agencies, including the Insurance \nDepartment which was upgraded from a division under \nthe Bank and Finance Department. The Insurance \nDepartment increased its staff and began operation as a \nfully-fledged department on 1 August 2003.  \n\nAt present, there is no plan to separate the Insurance \nDepartment from MOF. However, recognition is growing \nwithin MOF that substantial capacity building and \nresources would be required to monitor and supervise \nthe sector. A proposal to support financial independence \nof the Department by collecting fees from insurance \ncompanies has the backing of the industry. \n\nAwaiting supporting documents to review \ncompliance \n\nAn ADB consultant engaged under TA4035-VIE drafted \nan early warning system on non-life insurance in October \n2002. MOF received industry feedback and finalized the \ndraft for both life and non-life insurance companies. \nDecision No.153/QD-BTD on the System of Insurance \nBusiness Monitoring Indicators was issued on 22 \nSeptember 2003. The system is designed to detect \ninsolvency risks of insurance companies as early as \npossible, and to enable prompt action for monitoring and \nresolving such risks. MOF will use the system to \nenhance industry supervision, and the insurance \ncompanies will apply the system for improved internal \nrisk assessment and control. \n\n4\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nRefinements under \nProposed \nSubprogram II \nSubprogram II\u20142nd \ntranche release \ncondition.

More specifically, Decree 42 \nissued on 1 August 2001 provides regulations on \nfinancial issues of insurers and brokers, including steps \nto deal with problem insurance companies in Article 51. \nSteps include (i) warning; (ii) temporary suspension of \noperations; (iii) restricting the contents, scope, and \ngeographical area of operation; and (iv) withdrawal of \nlicense. The Insurance Department, as industry \nregulator, also has the power to dissolve an insurance \ncompany. \n\nThe ADB consultant engaged under TA4035-VIE gave \ntechnical inputs into specific procedures to deal with \nproblem insurance companies, including international \nbest practices. A draft procedure has been presented to \nMOF and the relevant officials have reviewed the \nproposal. The draft procedure, however, has yet to be \ndiscussed with the private sector. MOF and the \nInsurance Department recognize the fact that adopting a \nset procedure to deal with problem insurance companies \nas a key supervisory function of the Insurance \nDepartment would be important. \n\nAwaiting supporting documents to review \ncompliance \n\nIn 2002, MOF combined a few departments of the \nFinance Institute into a Banking and Insurance \nDepartment.

Code of conduct on fair \ninsurance and on chief owner liabilities was adopted for \nnon-life insurers. For life insurance, a code of conduct for \nagent recruitment was adopted. To improve the code of \nconduct, MOF established a forum for all life insurance \ncompanies. For sound development of the sector, a \nconcerted effort will be required to ensure that higher \ndemand for insurance products are being met by \nqualified insurance brokers and agents, adhering to a \nstrict, industry-endorsed code of conduct. \n\nGood progress made \n\nCircular 71 on Insurance Underwriting issued on 28 \nAugust 2001, provides implementing guidelines for \nDecree 42 dated 1 August 2001.

However, this was refuted on the basis of \nthe provision in Decree 16 that allowed leasing \ncompanies to engage in activities other than financial \nleasing.
