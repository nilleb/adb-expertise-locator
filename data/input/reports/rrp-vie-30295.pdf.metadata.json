FSPL II takes a cluster approach and consists of two back-to-\nback  subprograms.  Implementation  of  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I  is \nscheduled for completion in December 2004. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Financial Sector \nSubsector: Nonbanking \nThemes:  Sustainable  economic  growth,  Governance,  and  Pivate \nsector development \n   \nEnvironment  Category C. \nAssessment  The  environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no  significant \nadverse impact was identified. \n   \nSocial Sector  Involuntary resettlement: Category C. \nAssessment  Impact on Indigenous People: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected. \n   \nThe Program   Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector mirrors its economy and is in transition. \nRationale  The  Government  has  made  persistent  efforts  to  modernize  and \ntransform  the  financial  sector,  recognizing  its  significance  to  the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  performance.  Still,  plagued  by  many  factors \ninherited from the former regime, the formal financial system remains \nunderdeveloped, inefficient, and inaccessible to many. \n \nFinancial intermediation is low, and is dominated by bank savings \nand  loans.  The  banking  system\u2014with  its  high  levels  of \nnonperforming  loans\u2014is  unable  to  fully  support  economic \ndevelopment  and  generate  employment.  The  Government  has \ninitiated the process for financial and operational restructuring of the \nbanking subsector with assistance from the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) and World Bank under the poverty reduction and growth \nfacility (PRGF) and poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) in June \n2001.  FSPL  II  was  formulated  to  complement  this  process.  It \nspecifically addresses the need to develop alternative channels of \nfinancial intermediation to support Viet Nam\u2019s broad-based economic \ngrowth  and  socioeconomic  development  objectives,  including \npoverty reduction. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Board approved the cluster \nconcept of FSPL II and subprogram I for $50 million from the Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  on  20  November  2002.  Subprogram  I \nachieved  concrete  outputs  and  all  subprogram  I  second-tranche \nrelease conditions had been fully or substantially complied with by ", "iii \nOctober 2004. The Government has shown solid commitment to the \nreform program and is ready to continue with subprogram II.    \n \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II, building on achievements of subprogram I, \nwill  continue  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  develop \nalternative channels of financial intermediation such as money and \ncapital markets, insurance, leasing, and financial infrastructure to \nenhance  public  confidence.  The  nonbanking  subsector  and  the \ncapital market will provide long-term funds and investment capital \nthat are largely lacking in Viet Nam. Higher efficiency may be \nachieved  through  increased  competition  from  the  nonbanking \nsubsector. The financial system as a whole will be broader, better \nbalanced, and more resilient to external shocks. \n   \nObjective and  The objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to enable the \nScope  development  of  alternative  channels  of  market-based  financial \nintermediation.  Necessary  components  include  (i)  economic \npolicies  conducive  to  sound  and  vibrant  financial  sector \ndevelopment;  (ii)  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  that  will \npromote innovation and healthy competition while monitoring and \nreducing systemic risks; (iii) regulators with the authority, budget, \nskills,  and  established  procedures  to  monitor  and  enforce \nregulations; and (iv) supporting financial infrastructure. \n \nTo achieve the objective, the FSPL II focuses on \n(i)  establishing a regulatory framework for insurance business, \nstrengthening  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  frameworks, \nand promoting the development of key professionals; \n(ii)  promoting  the  leasing  industry  by  creating  a  coherent\nregulatory  framework,  establishing  ground  rules  for  contract \nenforcement, and enhancing public awareness; \n(iii)  enabling interbank and money market development through \nphased  interest  rate  deregulation,  more  money  market \ninstruments,  and  increased  development  of  the  market \nmicrostructure; \n(iv)  fostering the capital markets\u2019 financial intermediation by (a) \nestablishing  incentives  compatible  with  the  regulatory \nframework  for  increasing  quality  shares  trading  on  the \nsecurities market, (b) strengthening market surveillance, and \n(c) building the basis for institutional investors; and \n(v)  continuing  to  support  financial  infrastructure  such  as  the \naccounting  and  auditing  systems,  a  secured  transactions \nsystem, a deposit insurance system (assisted under FSPL I), \nand the beginnings of an anti-money-laundering regime. \n   ", "iv   \nLoan Amount and Terms  Subprogram II of FSPL II will comprise a loan to be drawn from the \nADF that will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Subprogram \nII of FSPL II is also proposed to be cofinanced by Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) for \u20ac12 million. \n   \nProgram Period and   The loan for subprogram II of $35 million will be released in three \nTranches  tranches: (i) $10 million upon fulfillment of specified first tranche \nrelease conditions, (ii) $15 million subject to fulfillment of specified\nsecond  tranche  release  conditions,  and  (iii)  $10  million  after \ncompletion  of  specified  third  tranche  release  conditions. \nImplementation of subprogram II is planned for 1 April 2005 to 1 \nApril 2007. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  will  continue  to  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  for  subprogram  II.  To  coordinate  program \nimplementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned,  a  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  has  been \nformed.  The  PSC,  chaired  by  a  deputy  governor  of  SBV, \ncomprises  senior  officers  from  all  ministries  and  government \nagencies concerned. The PSC will continue to meet twice yearly \nand on an ad-hoc basis to review pending issues and propose \nconcrete actions to resolve them, thus ensuring timely program \nimplementation. A program implementation and coordination unit, \nformed  within  SBV  and  headed  by  a  senior  SBV  officer,  will \ncontinue to assist ADB and the PSC in implementation. \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the FSPL II\u2014subprogram II will be disbursed for \na broad range of imports, subject to a negative list of ineligible \nitems. All procurement of goods and services produced in and \noriginating from ADB member countries will be made with due \nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with \nstandard public sector procedures in Viet Nam and normal private \nsector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. The Borrower will \ncertify  that  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from \nnonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii) \ndisbursements made under other official development assistance \nis greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the \nyear. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The policy framework for FSPL II includes specific components \nthat bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The counterpart \nfunds to be generated from loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe structural adjustment costs arising from FSPL II. \n   \n ", "v \nRisks and Safeguards  FSPL II faces three principal risks. The first is the resurfacing of \nsociopolitical pressure that could delay reform. Materialization of \nthis risk is contingent on economic performance. Judging from the \ncurrent status of the economy and its outlook\u2014as well as pro-\nreform statements and achievements made by the Government \nwith full public support\u2014this risk is currently limited. Nevertheless, \nmacroeconomic conditions and the sociopolitical situation will be \nclosely monitored against program objectives. \n \nThe second risk relates to progress in restructuring state-owned \nbanks and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), both of which weigh \nheavily on Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector. Many technical difficulties \nremain, and slower-than-expected progress has had implications \non achieving the objectives of FSPL II. However, the momentum \nbuilding toward carrying out the reform process is strong within \nthe Government. The comprehensive frameworks that the World \nBank  developed  under  the  PRSC  for  restructuring  banks  and \nSOEs, as well as associated technical assistance from bilateral \nagencies,  will  provide  the  necessary  technical  support.  ADB's \nclose coordination with IMF and the World Bank will continue, in \norder  to  synchronize  the  subsectoral  reform  measures  and \nachieve the full benefits of FSPL II.  \n \nThe third risk pertains to the technical capacities of implementing \nagencies. The Government\u2019s track record suggests that, given \nadequate  technical  support,  its  commitment  to  undertake  the \nproposed reforms is strong. In implementing subprogram I, for \nexample, delays were predominantly a result of a lack of technical \nexpertise  in  the  financial  sector,  particularly  for  drafting  laws, \nrules,  and  regulations.  The  delays  were  exacerbated  by  the \nconsensus building approach taken for their enactment, requiring \ninterministerial coordination. To reduce this risk, comprehensive \ndiscussions were undertaken with the implementing agencies and \nthe ongoing technical assistance (TA) for capacity building will \ntackle the technical difficulties anticipated with implementing the \npolicy actions proposed under FSPL II. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram II of the Financial Sector Program Loan II \n(FSPL II). \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  On 20 November 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board approved FSPL II,1 \n(i) the cluster concept of 3 subprograms for $75 million, and (ii) subprogram I for $50 million \nfrom the Asian Development Fund (ADF) to be released in two tranches: one of $20 million and \none of $30 million. The program\u2019s objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts in building an \nenabling  environment  for  alternative  channels  of  market-based  financial  intermediation. \nAlternative financial intermediation is becoming increasingly important for Viet Nam, whose \nfinancial sector remains dominated by bank savings and loans. The banking sector alone, with \nits high-level of nonperforming loans and planned restructuring, cannot support the economy in \nachieving its potential gross domestic product (GDP) growth, nor can it generate employment \nfor the expanding labor force. Necessary components for an enabling environment include (i) \neconomic policies conducive to sound and vibrant financial sector development; (ii) legal and \nregulatory frameworks that will promote innovation and healthy competition while monitoring \nand reducing systemic risks, (iii) regulators with the authority, budget, skills, and established \nprocedures to monitor and enforce regulations, and (iv) support for financial infrastructure.  \n \n3.  To achieve these objectives, FSPL II focuses on (i) establishing a regulatory framework \nfor  the  insurance  industry,  strengthening  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \npromoting the development of key professionals; (ii) promoting the leasing industry by creating a \ncoherent  regulatory  framework,  establishing  ground  rules  for  contract  enforcement,  and \nenhancing  public  awareness;  (iii)  enabling  interbank  and  money  market  development  by \ngradually deregulating interest rates, increasing the number of money market instruments, and \ndeveloping the market microstructure; (iv) fostering capital market financial intermediation by (a) \nestablishing incentives compatible with the regulatory framework for increasing the number of \nquality shares on the market, (b) strengthening market surveillance, and (c) building the basis \nfor participation by institutional investors; and (v) continuing to build financial infrastructure such \nas accounting and auditing systems, secured transactions system, a deposit insurance system, \nand an anti-money-laundering regime. (The logical framework is in Appendix 1 and summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2.) \n \n4.  Subprogram I was envisioned to be completed within 15 months from loan effectiveness. \nSubprograms II and III were to be processed sequentially upon completion of the previous \nsubprogram and completed within 12 months from effectiveness of each proceeding loan. The \ncluster  approach  provides  the  opportunity  to  refine  proposed  policy  actions  of  succeeding \nsubprograms  in  order  to  reflect  the  Government's  achievements,  the  changing  policy \nenvironment,  and  lessons  learned  from  the  previous  subprogram.  The  program  cluster \napproach thus allows flexibility and gives leverage to implement reform measures in a dynamic \npolitical, economic, and financial environment. \n \n5.  FSPL II loan agreement for subprogram I was signed on 29 January 2003. An inception \nmission was fielded from 17 to 18 February 2003. The Government submitted the legal opinion \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

", "2   \ndated 16 May 2003 to ADB, and subprogram I of FSPL II became effective as of 23 May 2003. \nA review mission fielded from 16 to 20 June 2003 confirmed that solid progress had been made \nin fulfilling the first tranche release policy actions under subprogram I. Upon confirmation that all \nseven conditions were met, the first tranche was released on 28 August 2003. Subsequent \nreview missions were fielded in December 2003 and June 2004. On the basis of the progress \nmade  in  subprogram  I  implementation,  the  fact-finding  mission  for  subprogram  II  was \nundertaken from 21 to 30 June 2004.  \n \n6.  In  support  of  FSPL  II  implementation,  ADB  also  provided  two  technical  assistance \nprojects (TAs).2 Technical inputs provided through the two projects were indispensable for \ntimely completion of policy actions under subprogram I. \n \nIII.  MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS \n7.  Viet Nam's annual economic growth rate increased from 5.8% in 2001 to 6.4% in 2002, \nand 7.1% in 2003. Growth in the industrial and construction sector was 8.9% in 2002 and 9.6% \nin 2003. Faster-paced economic growth has caused inflation to rise. The consumer price index \n(CPI) rose from 0.8% in 2001 to an average of 3-4% in 2002 and 2003. Against the backdrop of \nrobust GDP growth, fiscal and trade deficits increased, with the budget deficit widening to 4.8% \nof GDP in 2003 from 3.8% in 2002. The current account deficit rose to 5.8% of GDP in 2003 \nfrom 2.8% in 2002. The overall macroeconomic situation is stable, however, and the fiscal \ndeficit sustainable. Stable macroeconomic conditions for the past 2 years, a key precondition for \nimplementing financial sector reforms, has supported FSPL II implementation. \n \n8.  The economic targets set by the National Assembly in November 2003\u2014GDP growth of \n7.5\u20137.8%, a CPI increase of less than 5%, and fiscal deficit below 5% of GDP\u2014are generally \nviewed  by  the  Government  and  the  donor  community  as  achievable.  The  macroeconomic \nenvironment carries no immediate risks to FSPL II implementation. However, the relatively low \nlevel of financial intermediation continues and the nonbanking sector\u2014specifically the insurance \nsector  and  the  capital  markets,  the  two  main  components  of  FSPL  II\u2014have  gained  their \nrelevance as important means of domestic savings mobilization. \n \n9.   Viet Nam is making steady progress in structural reforms. The package of tax reforms \nwas approved by the National Assembly in May 2003 and has become effective as of January \n2004. The number of value-added taxes and exemptions has been reduced and the corporate \ntax rates unified for domestic and foreign-owned enterprises. Progress is also seen in Viet \nNam's commitments toward international integration, including the bilateral trade agreement \nwith the United States effective December 2001 and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) tariff \nreductions, which are proceeding as scheduled. Viet Nam also plans to join the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) in 2005. On the other hand, implementation of critical reforms planned for \nlarge  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  the  four  major  state-owned  commercial  banks \n(SOCBs) have been slower than expected, with implications for the money and capital market \ncomponents of FSPL II. Accelerating privatization and listing of large SOEs would bring the \nmuch-needed increase in supply of securities to the Ho Chi Minh Securities Trading Center \n(STC).  Stronger  pressure  on  SOCBs  to  improve  profitability  would  also  encourage  more \ntransactions on the secondary money market. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

FSPL II SUBPROGRAM I\u2014STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION \nA.  Status of Subprogram I Second Tranche Release Policy Actions  \n10.  In  line  with  the  objectives  of  FSPL  II,  the  Government  adopted  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional measures under subprogram I. Many measures required extensive coordination to \nascertain stakeholders' understanding, acceptance, and actual adoption. Of the 17 subprogram \nI second tranche release conditions, 15 have been fully complied with and 2 substantially \ncomplied with (Appendix 3).  \n \n11.  The  insurance  component  under  subprogram  I  had  seven  second  tranche  release \nconditions,  three  of  which  are  in  support  of  creating  equal  opportunities  to  enhance \ncompetitiveness of the insurance market. \n \n(i)  The Ministry of Finance to adopt a simple and transparent approval system \nfor changes in the operation of insurance companies (complied with). \n \n12.  The revised Circular 71, issued by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) as Circular 98 on 15 \nOctober 2004, streamlines the approval system for changes in the operation of insurance \ncompanies, opening of new branches, and introduction of new products, reducing considerably \nthe time and steps required for obtaining MOF clearance. \n \n(ii)  The Ministry of Finance to continue to grant licenses for insurance brokers, \nregardless  of  the  ownership  form,  to  enhance  competitiveness  in  the \nbrokerage business (complied with). \n \n13.  The number of licensed insurance brokers rose from one state-owned company in 2001 \nto five, including one foreign-owned company and several joint-stock companies, by the end of \nSeptember 2004. \n \n(iii)  The  Ministry  of  Finance  to  specify  incentive  measures  for  insurance \ncompanies to develop new insurance products, especially for products in \nsupport  of  agricultural,  forestry,  and  fisheries  activities  (substantially \ncomplied with). \n \n14.  MOF awarded additional incentives to promote industry segments that have experienced \nsubstantial  losses  for  insurers  and  led  to  withdrawal  of  insurance  products.  To  develop \nagricultural insurance, for example, MOF licensed Groupama, a French insurance company, to \nestablish a 100%-foreign-owned, non-life insurance company and gave it preferential treatments \nin terms of agents' commissions and operational scope. General guidelines on incentives will \nneed to be prepared in future. Such guidelines, however, will require rigorous actuarial studies \nand cost/benefit analyses. \n \n15.  There  are  three  subprogram  I  second  tranche  release  conditions  for  strengthening \nsupervision and prudential regulations of the insurance sector. \n \n(iv)  The Ministry of Finance to adopt procedures for onsite inspection and off-\nsite surveillance for insurance companies (complied with). \n \n ", "4   \n16.  The  Notice  on  the  Issuance  of  Procedures  for  On-site  Inspections  and  Off-site \nSupervisions  over  Insurance  Business,  issued  by  MOF  on  28  September  2004,  provides \ncomprehensive guidelines for conducting off-site surveillance and onsite inspection of insurance \ncompanies. During subprogram I implementation, MOF conducted several off-site surveillance \nsessions and onsite inspections in accordance with adopted procedures. \n \n(v)  The  Ministry  of  Finance  to  adopt  accounting  system  for  insurance \ncompanies (complied with). \n \n17.  MOF  revised  Circular  72,  providing  regulations  on  financial  issues  of  insurance \nenterprise and insurance brokerage enterprise, and issued it as Circular 99 on 15 October 2004, \naligning  the  accounting  principles  for  insurance  companies  to  international  practice.  The \npreviously  adopted  accounting  system  for  calculating  reserves  of  unearned  premiums, \noutstanding  claims,  and  incurred-but-not-reported  claims  was  particularly  problematic. \nReserving for non-life insurers, for example, following the pure statistical methods, resulted in \noverstatements  of  profits  and  commensurate  understatement  of  liabilities,  and  policyholder \nreserves in particular. \n \n(vi)  The Ministry of Finance to introduce detailed sanction mechanisms for \nadministrative violations in insurance businesses (complied with). \n \n18.  Decree  118/2003/ND-CP  on  sanctioning  of  administrative  offences  by  insurance \ncompanies was issued on 13 October 2003. Measures stipulated under the decree tighten \nenforcement of sanctions for administrative offences in the management and usage of licenses, \nassignment of insurance contracts, unlawful competitive action, forced purchase of insurance, \nbreaches in provisions on reserve requirements, appropriation, management and usage of \noperational reserves, investment of capital, and financial prudence. \n \n19.  The last of the seven subprogram I second tranche release conditions for the insurance \ncomponent concerns developing professionals in the insurance sector. \n    \n(vii)  The Ministry of Finance to endorse plans for development of actuaries and \nloss adjusters submitted by insurance businesses (complied with). \n \n20.  In 2002, a 3-year program on actuarial science opened in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), \ncomprising 2 years\u2019 training in universities in Viet Nam and 1 year of overseas training at the \nInstitute of Financial Science and Insurance at Universit\u00e9 de Lyon in France. MOF also merged \nseveral  subdepartments  at  the  Finance  Institute  of  MOF  to  create  the  Banking  Insurance \nDepartment. The Department has a 4-year official training program on finance and insurance. \nPreparation is also underway for establishing the insurance training program for insurance \nregulators at the Finance Institute. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), cofinancier of \nFSPL II, is supporting training of trainers to ensure quality of programs being offered at the \nFinance Institute. \n \n21.  There  is  one  subprogram  I  second  tranche  release  condition  under  the  leasing \ncomponent.  This  condition  supports  establishing  a  regulatory  environment  conducive  to \nbusiness development. \n \n \n \n ", "    5 \n(viii)  The State Bank of Viet Nam, in cooperation with related ministries and \nagencies, to issue guidelines on  \n \na.  issuance of an import code for financial leasing companies;  \nb.  custom clearance procedures to facilitate importing leased assets; \nc.  avoidance of dual registration fees when the ownership of leased assets \nis transferred to the lessee upon termination of leasing period; and \nd.  legal recognition of a notarized copy of vehicle registration (complied \nwith).  \n \n22.  All four regulatory changes were effected as of October 2003. Concerning items a. and b. \nabove,  General  Customs  Department  issued  Circular  07,  for  the  import  code  of  leasing \ncompanies and Official Dispatch 5415/Tchq-GSOL to provide guidance on custom clearance for \nimporting lease assets to provincial and city customs on 28 October 2003.  To address item c. \nabove, MOF issued Circular 53 on 25 June 2002 for avoidance of dual registration fees and for \nitem d., the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) issued Official Dispatch 1448/TP-CC on the Notarization of \nCopies of Registration Certificates, recognizing notarized copies of vehicle registration papers.  \n \n23.  There are three conditions under the money market component, two of which support \nthe development of money market instruments. \n \n(ix)  The Ministry of Finance to issue short-term treasury bills with maturities of \nless than 1 year (complied with). \n \n24.  MOF has been issuing short-term treasury bills since 2000 under Decree 01 on an ad-\nhoc basis. The issuance is now regularized with notification on the auction publicly made on a \nquarterly basis. The Treasury now also issues directions for issuance of treasury bills with \nmaturities of 6 months, 9 months, and 364 days to SBV. \n \n(x)  The State Bank of Viet Nam to issue a regulation on interbank repurchase \nagreement of valuable papers in the market and a standardized repurchase \nagreement contract to be used for interbank trading (complied with). \n \n25.  SBV issued a regulation on trading valuable papers among credit institutions on 15 \nOctober 2004 as Decision 1325/2004/QD-NHNN. This regulation covers regulation on interbank \nmarket for repurchase agreements. A standardized repurchase agreement contract was issued \nby the Council of the Bankers Association of Viet Nam on 13 September 2004 as Decision 284-\nQD/HHNH.   \n \n26.  The  third  subprogram  I  second  tranche  release  condition  under  the  money  market \ncomponent supports improvements to the structure of the money market.  \n \n(xi)  The State Bank of Viet Nam to issue a regulation on brokerage activities \n(complied with). \n \n27.  The SBV governor issued Decision 315/2004/QD-NHNN on 7 April 2004 on brokerage \nactivities, allowing licensed credit institutions to apply for licenses in money brokerage activities \nfor certificates of deposit, foreign exchange, interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange swaps \nand options. ", "6   \n28.  There were two conditions under the capital market component, the first supporting the \nestablishment of market surveillance system as part of the necessary regulatory framework. \n \n(xii)  The  State  Securities  Commission  to  adopt  (a)  a  procedure  for  market \nsurveillance,  and  (b)  an  inspection  procedure  for  securities  companies \n(complied with). \n \n29.  MOF, on behalf of SSC, issued Decision 259/QD-UBCK on market surveillance and \nDecision  258/QD-UBCK  on  inspection  procedures  for  securities  companies  both  on  27 \nSeptember 2004. All securities companies underwent SSC's onsite inspection in late 2003.  \n \n30.  The second subprogram I second tranche policy condition under the capital market \ncomponent supports development of institutional investors. \n \n(xiii)  The State Securities Commission to draft an amendment to Decree 48 to \ninclude regulations on the establishment of securities investment funds \n(complied with). \n \n31.  Decree 144/2003/ND-CP, amending Decree 48, was issued on 28 November 2003. The \nmajor changes include (i) SSC's expanded authority to regulate initial public offerings (IPOs), (ii) \nless stringent requirements for listing, particularly for those to be listed on the small- and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) board, (iii) new provisions on information disclosure, increased \ncontent and frequency of information, (iv) rules and requirements on securities investment \nfunds, and (v) regulations on mergers and acquisitions (M&A). \n \n32.  There are four conditions supporting strengthening of the financial infrastructure. Two \nare for developing a secured transactions system, one for developing a computerized system \nand one on resolving legal inconsistencies. \n \n(xiv)  The  Ministry  of  Justice  to  carry  out  necessary  activities  to  develop  a \ncentralized, computerized, and networked registration system for secured \ntransactions and to develop a national database system for the secured \ntransactions (complied with). \n \n33.  The feasibility study for a centralized, computerized, and networked registration system \nfor secured transactions was completed in May 2002. However, the approval of the study was \ndelayed  because  of  government  concerns  over  its  cost  estimate.  The  system  design  was \nrevised during the consultative process and the Minister of Justice approved the feasibility study \non 15 October 2004 under Decision 560/QD-BTP. Implementation will begin in 2005. \n \n(xv)  The  Ministry  of  Justice  and  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  to  review \nregulations  on  secured  transactions  and  on  registration  of  secured \ntransactions,  and  to  ensure  the  consistency  of  current  regulations  on \nsecured transactions and their registration (substantially complied with). \n \n34.  The major inconsistency between Decree 165 drafted by MOJ and Decree 178 drafted \nby SBV on the use of a single asset to secure multiple obligations was reconciled by the \nissuance of Decree 85 on 25 October 2002, revising Decree 178. However, inconsistencies \nremain, principally because Decree 85 assumes no other lender than financial institutions. SBV \nand MOJ continue discussions and plan to further revise Decree 85 to ensure incorporation of \nlenders other than financial institutions.  ", "    7 \n35.  FSPL  II  supports  the  Government  to  further  develop  and  strengthen  the  Deposit \nInsurance Corporation of Viet Nam (DIV). A subprogram II second tranche release condition \nrelates to joint SBV-DIV on-site inspection of covered financial institutions. \n \n(xvi)  The State Bank of Viet Nam to issue a regulation on procedures for State \nBank of Viet Nam/Deposit Insurance Corporation of Viet Nam joint on-site \ninspections for covered institutions (complied with). \n \n36.  Subsequent to discussions between DIV and SBV\u2019s Bank Inspectorate Division, an \nOfficial  Dispatch  329/NHNN-TTr  was  issued  by  the  SBV  governor  on  5  April  2004.  This \nspecifies procedures for DIV in requesting a joint SBV on-site inspection when DIV encounters \nproblems with covered financial institutions. \n \n37.  There was one subprogram II second tranche release condition for establishing the anti-\nmoney-laundering system. \n \n(xvii)  The State Bank of Viet Nam to submit a decree on anti-money-laundering \nregulation for the consideration of the Government (complied with). \n  \n38.  SBV submitted a draft decree on anti-money-laundering to the National Assembly\u2019s \nstanding  committee  on  21  May  2004  under  Official  Dispatch  518/NHNN-TTr.  The  decree \ncontains  the  essential  elements  required  for  an  effective  anti-money-laundering  regime, \nincluding  provisions  for  (i)  customer  identification  by  financial  institutions,  (ii)  reporting  of \nsuspicious transactions, (iii) functions of the financial intelligence unit; and (iv) international \ncooperation to fight money laundering. The Decree is expected to be issued in 2005. \n \nB.  Program Implementation  \n1.  Insurance and Leasing Sectors \n39.  FSPL II supports development of the nonbanking subsector, represented by insurance \nand leasing, both of which are at the early stages of development. While the two industries are \nsmall, their growth has been exceptional. During subprogram I implementation, steady progress \nwas made in putting in place the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks for building an \nenvironment to support the sound development of insurance and leasing. \n \n    a.   Insurance Sector \n \n40.  FSPL II aims to promote the sound development of the insurance sector by supporting \nthe Government in (i) creating a competitive business environment, (ii) enhancing corporate \ngovernance of insurance companies, (iii) strengthening supervision and prudential regulations, \nand (iv) developing insurance sector infrastructure. The Government, as a first step toward \nmeeting these objectives, upgraded the insurance management division to department status in \nAugust 2003 and strengthened its supervisory capacity. MOF also hosted the 6th Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Insurance Regulators\u2019 Meeting and the ASEAN Council of \nInsurance Meeting from 19 to 23 August 2003. The meeting had more than 80 participants and \nconcluded  with  an  agreement  on  concrete  measures  for  cooperation  among  insurance \nsupervisors. Viet Nam, as the host country, presented thematic reports on the liberalization \nprocess of financial services in ASEAN countries and the initial results of opening up Viet Nam\u2019s \ninsurance market to foreign companies. \n ", "8   \n41.  During implementation of FSPL II\u2014subprogram I, several deregulatory measures were \nadopted to create a competitive environment for financial services (paras. 11-14), strengthening \nsupervision  and  prudential  regulations  (paras.  15-18)  and  developing  insurance  sector \ninfrastructure (paras. 19-20).  \n \n42.  Recent  achievements  for  improving  corporate  governance  in  the  insurance  sector \ninclude  Decision  175/2003/QD-TTg  issued  by  the  prime  minister  approving  the  2003-2010 \ninsurance market development strategy. The strategy addresses, in a phased manner, some of \nthe  major  corporate  governance  issues  in  the  insurance  sector.  The  ownership  and \nmanagement of the state-owned insurance companies were reviewed and Bao Viet, the largest \nstate-owned  insurance  company,  will  be  transformed  into  a  one-member  limited  liability \ncompany  operating  under  the  Enterprise  Law.  In  accordance  with  the  strategy,  the  prime \nminister endorsed equitization of two other state-owned insurers: HCMC Insurance Company \n(Bao Minh) and Vietnam Reinsurance Company (VINARE). In July 2004, Bao Minh issued \nshares  worth  D97  billion  or  32%  of  its  equity  to  the  public  while  VINARE  is  planned  for \nequitization and listing on the Ho Chi Minh City STC by 2007. Although the majority stake will \nremain with the state, concrete steps forward have been made toward privatization of the state-\nowned insurance companies. \n \n    b.  Leasing Sector \n \n43.  To support the emergent leasing sector, FSPL II addresses two critical issues: (i) the \nregulatory environment is not conducive to business development, and lacks clear ground rules \nfor contract enforcement; and (ii) public awareness of the leasing industry is inadequate. With \nSBV\u2019s solid commitment to developing the sector, progress was made not only in adopting \nmeasures to fulfill FSPL II policy actions but also to enhance the operating environment for the \nsector.  \n \n44.  A second tranche release policy action under subprogram I, requiring consultation with \nvarious government ministries and agencies, was fulfilled by October 2003 (paras. 21-22). The \nGovernment has taken actions to improve the environment for business development. These \ninclude  (i)  issuance of  a  new  regulation  facilitating  the  opening  of  new  branches,  and  (ii) \nstreamlined tax system for financial leases under Circular 24 issued by MOF on 20 March 2003. \nSBV is also revising the decree and circular on leasing and is scheduled to submit them to the \nGovernment in early 2005. The revised decree will contain provisions on methods to deal with \nleased assets in cases of default on lease contracts (policy action subprogram III, B. 1). SBV, \nMOJ, and the Peoples' Supreme Court are involved in discussions on regulations, procedures, \nand methods to deal with leased assets in the case of default.  \n \n45.  To promote public awareness of leasing, as well as capacity building for those engaged \nin leasing, conferences with leasing professionals from other developing countries were held in \nHanoi and HCMC on 25 and 27 August 2004, respectively. The conferences were successful in \npromoting better public awareness of leasing, as well as in demonstrating SBV's commitment to \ndeveloping the sector. \n \n2.  Money and Capital Markets \n46.  FSPL II also supports development of the money and capital markets. The overall \ndevelopment of the two markets was constrained by slower-than-expected progress in SOCB \nand  SOE  restructuring.  Nevertheless,  steady  progress  was  made  during  subprogram  I  in ", "    9 \nimplementing the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks for expanding the role of the two \nmarkets within the financial sector. \n \n    a.  Interbank and Money Market \n \n47.  FSPL  II  supports  the  Government's  initiative  to  develop  the  interbank  and  money \nmarkets by focusing on (i) deregulating interest rates, (ii) developing money market instruments, \n(iii) improving the market structure, and (iv) enhancing the treasury function and capacity of \nSOCBs. Availability of money market instruments has increased as a result of a regulation \nallowing the issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit (a first tranche release condition under \nsubprogram  I),  regularized  issuance  of  short-term  treasury  bills  by  MOF  and  issuance  of \nregulations on repurchase agreements (second tranche release conditions under subprogram I, \nparas. 23-25). \n \n48.  To further develop money market instruments, FSPL II also supports an integrated legal \nframework that will allow for growth and innovation, and proposes adoption of a negotiable \ninstruments law (policy actions subprogram II, C. 2, and subprogram III, C. 1). With technical \ninputs  from  ADB  consultants  engaged  under  TA4035-VIE,  the  first  draft  of  the  negotiable \ninstruments  law  was  completed  and  the  draft  is  currently  under  review  by  the  steering \ncommittee that was established on 2 April 2004 for that purpose. The committee comprises \nrepresentatives from SBV, MOF, the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), MOJ, and the \nGovernment's Office. The draft law is scheduled for submission to the National Assembly for \ndeliberation in 2006. Progress outside of FSPL II includes successful completion of the first \nphase of a World-Bank-funded project on modernizing the banking and payment systems. The \nsystem created the foundation for a national payment system, integral for development of the \ninterbank and money markets. \n \nb.  Capital Market \n49.  Development  objectives  for  the  capital  market  component  of  FSPL  II  include  (i) \nbroadening the capital market base, (ii) establishing a consolidated regulatory framework and \nmarket surveillance system (paras. 28-31, and 90), (iii) developing institutional investors (paras. \n31 and 71), (iv) developing self-regulatory organizations (para. 72), and (v) enhancing market \nmicrostructure. Solid steps forward were taken in all five areas during FSPL II\u2014subprogram I.  \n \n50.  In order to broaden the capital market base, FSPL II supports measures to link the SOE \nequitization program and STC listing through adoption of a list of SOEs as candidates for listing \n(policy action subprogram II, D. 1). In 2003 the Steering Committee on Enterprise Reform and \nDevelopment (SCERD) prepared a list of 2,000 SOEs to be equitized during the next 3 years. \nThe Government approved the list at the end of 2003. Among those listed, 230 SOEs have \nbeen identified as having chartered capital above D10 billion, thus meeting one qualification for \nlisting. Furthermore, MOF is revising Decree 64 on equitization, providing tax incentives for \nlisting to SOEs undergoing equitization.  \n \n51.  FSPL II also supports a trading board for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \nto further broaden the capital market (policy action subprogram II, D. 2). The prime minister \ngave approval to open the Hanoi STC for SMEs in 2002. Subsequently, SSC Chairman issued \nDecision  329/QD-UBCK  on  17  December  2003  on  the  functions,  duties,  powers,  and \norganization of the Hanoi STC and on 17 June 2004, MOF approved implementing guidelines \nfor the operation of the Hanoi STC. Candidates for listing will have registered capital of D5-30 ", "10   \nbillion. The official opening of the Hanoi STC is scheduled for 2005 and as of September 2004 \napproximately 10 companies have been identified for listing.3  \n \n52.  Measures  taken  to  enhance  market  structure  during  subprogram  I  implementation \ninclude progress in establishing a centralized depository and an automated clearing/settlement \nsystem. In April 2004, the SSC finalized an Information Technology (IT) Master Plan, which \nincludes the depository and clearing/settlement systems. The IT Master Plan also includes an \nautomated surveillance system as well as a circuit breaker system based on market index. Full \nimplementation of the IT system is scheduled for 2007. \n \n3.  Financial Infrastructure \n53.  FSPL  II  includes  four  components  under  financial  infrastructure  development  (i) \nstrengthening the accounting and auditing system, (ii) implementing the registry for secured \ntransactions system, (iii) strengthening the deposit insurance system, and (iv) developing the \nanti-money-laundering regime. \n \na.  Accounting and Auditing System \n54.  The  accounting  and  auditing  system  is  widely  recognized  as  the  key  financial \ninfrastructure, largely determining the soundness and efficiency of a market-based financial \nsystem. This component of FSPL II seeks to (i) establish accounting enforcement mechanisms, \nand (ii) develop a competitive accounting industry. The Accounting Law passed on 17 June \n2003 and Decrees 128 and 129 issued on 31 May 2004, providing guidelines on the Accounting \nLaw, brings accounting practices significantly closer to international standards. Decree 105 on \nIndependent Audit,4 issued on 30 March 2004, stipulates that all banks, insurance companies, \nlisted firms, SOEs, foreign invested enterprises, and nationally important Group A projects must \nbe audited by independent auditors who are fully liable for their work. Furthermore, the decree \nbans establishment of any new state-owned auditing companies and requires all currently state-\nowned auditing companies and joint stock companies operating under the Enterprise Law to be \nconverted into partnerships, private firms, or foreign-invested companies. The decree became \neffective on 14 April 2004. \n \nb.  Secured Transactions System \n55.  The  Government  has  made  steady  progress  toward  developing  a  nationwide, \ncomputerized secured transactions registration system. In 2002, registration centers for asset \ntransactions were established in Hanoi and HCMC. MOJ is preparing to open a Danang office \nby end 2004. During 10 months of operations in 2003, the Hanoi registration center had 6,043 \napplications to register assets, and HCMC had 6,047 applications. In the 6 months starting \nJanuary 2004, the two centers had 4,674 and 4,423 applications, respectively. Some procedural \nissues  need  to  be  addressed,  but  pilot  testing  at  the  two  registration  centers  has  been \nsuccessful.  A  feasibility  study  of  the  nationwide  computerized  registration  system  was \ncompleted and submitted to the Minister of Justice in July 2004. Following approval of the \nfeasibility  study,  building  a  networked,  and  computerized,  nationwide  secured  transactions \nregistration system will begin in 2005. \n                                                 \n3  The Hanoi Securities Trading Center is currently designed as a board for small- and medium-sized enterprises to \nbecome an over-the-counter board in 2007. A Ministry of Finance circular says that companies may list on the \nHanoi STC if they have capital between VND5-30 billion, while the Ho Chi Minh City STC's minimum capital \nrequirement will be raised to VND30 billion. \n4  The decree replaces Decree 7 of 1994. ", "    11 \n56.  For the system to function smoothly, interministerial coordination needs to improve. The \nprime  minister  issued  Directive  21-2003-CT-TTG  on  2  October  2004  to  direct  government \nministries  and  agencies  involved  in  registration  of  secured  transactions  to  resolve  several \npending issues. Included are (i) Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on secured \ntransactions for register of immovable properties, (ii) Ministry of Transport and Communication \nfor registration of aircraft and ships for secured transactions, (iii) Ministry of Interior for the \nposition of registrar at the registration offices, and (iv) SBV on compliance by credit institutions \nwhen providing loans secured by registered assets. The drafting of the ordinance for secured \ntransactions\u2014submission  of  which  to  the  National  Assembly  is  a  FSPL  II  policy  action \n(subprogram III, E-2. 2)\u2014has begun. The ordinance will contain all procedural matters related to \nsecured transactions, while the civil code, currently being revised, will cover all substantive \nmatters. The third draft of the ordinance was produced and consultations with stakeholders \nbegun during subprogram I. The National Assembly\u2019s deliberation on the ordinance, however, \nhas been delayed to 2005 due to the full legislative schedule of the National Assembly. \n \nc.  Deposit Insurance System \n57.  DIV officially became operational in July 2000 under Decision 218 QD/TTg issued by the \nPrime Minister on 9 November 1999. DIV has the mandate to (i) protect the legal interest of \nsmall depositors, (ii) contribute to maintaining the stability of credit institutions, and (iii) ensure \nthe safe and sound development of the banking business. As of May 2004, DIV had paid out \nD14,067 billion to 1,353 depositors of 32 failed people's credit funds.  \n \n58.  Policy actions supported under FSPL II include measures to (i) address moral hazard \nproblems  by  specifying  strict  conditions  under  which  DIV  can  provide  financial  support  to \nproblem banks (policy action subprogram II, E-3. 8), and (ii) legally empower DIV to finance \nfrom outside sources the payout for depositors in cases of large failures and charge different \npremiums in accordance to distinct categories of credit institutions being covered (policy action \nsubprogram II, E-3. 7). DIV management reviewed its operations 3 years after establishment in \n2004 and identified eleven policy changes needed, including policy actions supported under \nFSPL II. The process of revising the decree on deposit insurance will begin in 2005. \n  \nd.  Anti-money Laundering Regime \n59.  The  Government  recognizes  the  growing  importance  of  the  fight  against  money \nlaundering, and there is a rising interest in establishing an effective anti-money-laundering \nregime. Of critical importance are measures to (i) enhance awareness of anti-money-laundering \nactivities within the Government and private businesses, (ii) establish the legal and regulatory \nbasis  for  combating  money  laundering,  and  (iii)  devise  systems  for  reporting  suspicious \ntransactions. SBV and MOJ have sent representatives to observe meetings held by the Asia \nPacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)5 in the past. Government representatives were also \npresent at the 2003 and 2004 APG annual meetings. \n \n60.  The process of establishing an anti-money-laundering regime in Viet Nam began with \nthe drafting of an anti-money-laundering decree with SBV as the lead agency. The draft was \npresented  for  discussion  among  all  ministries  and  government  agencies  concerned  in  a \nroundtable  discussion  held  28-29  August  2002.  After  official  comments  from  government \n                                                 \n5  The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering was established in 1997 to facilitate the adoption, implementation, \nand  enforcement  of  internationally  accepted  anti-money  laundering  standards  as  set  out  in  the  40 \nrecommendations and 8 special recommendations on terrorist financing of the Financial Actions Task Force on \nMoney Laundering. Currently, it has 28 members and ADB is an observer international organization. ", "12   \nministries and agencies, and appraisal by MOJ, the draft decree was submitted to the Standing \nCommittee of the National Assembly on 21 May 2004, thereby fulfilling a subprogram I second \ntranche release condition. The decree contains the essential elements required for an effective \nanti-money-laundering regime, including provisions for (i) customer identification by financial \ninstitutions, (ii) reporting of suspicious transactions, (iii) functions of the financial intelligence unit \nand  (iv)  international  cooperation  to  fight  money  laundering.  ADB  will  continue  to  provide \ntechnical input for establishing the financial intelligence unit, as stipulated in the Decree on Anti-\nmoney Laundering through TA4290-VIE.  \n \nC.  Performance Monitoring \n61.  To facilitate performance monitoring, baseline data was collected for each subsector. \nKey data is below: \n \nTable 2: Performance Monitoring Baseline Data \n \nPerformance Data  2002  2003 \nM2/GDP (%)  64  67 \nTotal financial assets/GDP (%)  74  84 \nGross insurance premiums  \u2013 Life (D billion)   4,368    6,317  \n    \u2013 Non-life (D billion)   2,624   3,875 \nInsurers \u2013 State-owned (D billion)   4,265   5,868 \n   \u2013 Private (D billion)   2,727   4,632 \nTotal Premium (% of GDP)    1.3  1.8 \nState-owned Insurers (% of total)  61  56 \nPrivate Insurers (% of total)  39  44 \nTotal value of lease contracts outstanding (D billion)  2,770  3,980 \nTotal money market transactions  \u2013\u2013  \u2013\u2013 \nSTC market capitalization (D billion)  2,539  2,405 \nSTC turnover (D billion)  1,083  2,998  \n\u2013\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = money supply, STC = Securities Trading Center. \nSources: Ministry of Finance, State Bank Of Viet Nam, And State Securities Commission. \n \n62.  During  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I  implementation,  the  insurance  sector  experienced \nimpressive growth, averaging over 40% growth per annum in total premiums earned during \n2001-2003. As of December 2003, there were 24 licensed insurance companies in Viet Nam: 4 \nstate-owned insurers, 7 joint-stock companies, 7 joint ventures, and 6 wholly-foreign-owned \ncompanies.  Total capital  of the  insurance companies  amounted  to  D1,715  billion  in  2001, \nD1,900 billion in 2002 and D2,269 billion in 2003. The total insurance premiums amounted to \nD4,982 billion in 2001, D6,632 billion in 2002, and D10,192 billion in 2003. Insurance premiums \nfor life insurance policies were D2,793 billion in 2001, D4,368 billion in 2002 and D6,317 billion \nin 2003. Insurance premiums for non-life insurance policies were D2,189 billion in 2001, D 2,624 \nbillion in 2002, and D3,875 billion in 2003.  \n \n63.  At  present  there  are  eight  financial  leasing  companies\u2014five  state-owned,  one  joint \nventure, and two wholly-owned foreign leasing companies\u2014operating in Viet Nam. Total assets \nof the leasing companies amounted to D1,950 billion in 2001, D3,120 billion in 2002 and D4,360 \nin 2003. The total amount of lease contracts outstanding amounted to D1,630 billion in 2001, \nD2,770 billion in 2002, and D3,980 billion in 2003.  Leasing companies\u2019 high asset growth has \nprompted all leasing companies to apply for an increase in chartered capital in 2004. ", "    13 \n64.  To date, the money market transactions have been limited to trade in valuable papers \nbetween  SBV  and  credit  institutions  as  a  monetary  policy  tool.  Secondary  market  trading \nvolumes for valuable papers have been insignificant. Trading between SBV and the credit \ninstitutions through open market operations amounted to a total of D21,184 billion in 2003. \nDecision 477 issued on 28 April 2004, replacing Decision 516, will require that credit institutions \nreport trading volumes of valuable papers in the secondary market as of 1 January 2005. This \nwill allow SBV to better track money market transactions between credit institutions. \n \n65.  The capital market, on the other hand, is experiencing steady expansion. As of May \n2004, the HCMC STC had 24 listed companies, with total market capitalization of D3,906 billion. \nAlso as of May 2004, the total value of government bonds and corporate bonds listed stood at \nD16,472 billion and D157.7 billion, respectively. The daily turnover for each trading session is \nD12.1 billion. There are currently 13 securities firms in Viet Nam with total capital of D605.73 \nbillion and 1 licensed investment fund with a total value of D300 billion.  \n \n66.  Available data shows that the financial subsectors being supported under FSPL II, with \nthe exception of the money market, are experiencing solid growth. Although it is still too early for \nassessments, the program objective to develop alternative channels of financial intermediation \nappears to be on track. Performance of each subsector will continue to be closely monitored \nand relevant data compiled throughout FSPL II implementation. \n \nD.  Conclusion on Implementation of Subprogram I \n67.  The implementing agencies' commitment to complete FSPL II\u2014subprogram I was visible \nin the steady progress made toward fulfilling all policy actions throughout implementation. Of the \n17 second tranche release conditions, 15 are fully met and 2 substantially met, with ongoing \ncompliance.  Quality  of  outputs  under  subprogram  I  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  The \ncapacity to implement reforms varied, however, and periodic shortages of qualified staff caused \ndelays in the reform agenda. Capacity of implementing agencies is being developed under the \ntwo TAs and it is assessed that with strong commitment to continue with the reform program, \nthe Government is ready to proceed to FSPL II\u2014subprogram II. Moreover, there is momentum \nbuilding in undertaking reform measures within the financial sector components covered under \nFSPL II and continuing with FSPL II\u2013\u2013subprogram II without interruption will be important for \nachieving program objectives. In view of the significant progress made in the implementation of \nthe overall Program and the substantial compliance with the second tranche conditions, release \nof the second tranche of the FSPL II\u2013\u2013subprogram I is justified. \n \nV.  FSPL II SUBPROGRAM II\u2014PROPOSED LOAN \nA.  Progress in Policy Actions under Subprograms II and III \n68.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  reform  by  taking  advanced \nactions in a number of key areas. These are discussed below. Details of the progress with all \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II and III policy actions are in Appendix 4. \n \n1.  Insurance Sector  \n69.  FSPL II proposed MOF to develop and apply an early warning system to detect risks of \nfailure at insurance companies by reviewing operations and financial positions (policy action \nsubprogram II, A. 4). With the assistance and technical inputs from experts engaged under \nTA4035-VIE, the early warning system was developed and issued on 27 September 2003 as ", "14   \nDecision  153:  System  Monitoring  Indicators.  To  build  the  overall  capacity  of  insurance \nprofessionals, MOF was to establish an insurance department in the Finance Institute (policy \naction subprogram II, A. 6). MOF has combined subdepartments of the Finance Institute into a \nBanking and Insurance Department, currently offering a 4-year insurance training program. \nMOF trainers for the insurance program are being trained with support from AFD.  \n \n2.  Leasing Sector  \n70.  FSPL II identified regulatory and administrative gaps to be addressed for developing an \nenabling  business  environment  for  the  leasing  sector.  A  major  gap  was  that  the  leasing \ncompanies were only able to engage in financial leasing. FSPL II proposed that SBV issue a \nregulation allowing leasing companies to provide both finance and operating leases (policy \naction subprogram II, B. 1). SBV issued a regulation to allow operating leases on 15 June 2004. \nSBV intends to further strengthen the legal framework of the leasing sector by revising Decree \n16, governing the leasing industry, in which operating and financial leases will be both covered \nas the main activities of leasing companies. \n \n3.  Capital Market \n71.  In order to foster the capital market, FSPL II supported the establishment of a trading \nboard  for  SMEs  and  developing  institutional  investors  in  Viet  Nam.  Specifically,  FSPL  II \nproposed that (i) SSC to approve a trading board for SMEs in Hanoi (policy action subprogram II, \nD.  2),  and (ii)  the  Government  to  issue  the amended  Decree  48  including  regulations  on \nestablishment of securities investment funds (policy action subprogram II, D. 4). The policy \naction to approve a trading board for SMEs in Hanoi was also specified as a trigger condition for \nprocessing subprogram II. Both policy conditions have been met. The MOF, on behalf of the \nSSC, issued an implementing circular on 17 June 2004 detailing the operational design of the \nHanoi STC. So far, SSC has a preliminary list of 10 SMEs that may list on the Hanoi STC. The \nGovernment  also  issued  Decree  144,  a  revision  of  Decree  48,  on  28  November  2003.  It \nincludes provisions for (i) participation in an investment fund, (ii) form of investment fund, (iii) \nestablishment of an investment fund, (iv) application documents and a timeframe for granting \nlicenses for establishment of an investment fund, (v) dissolution of an investment fund, (vi) \ninvestment  fund  board,  (vii)  a  custodian  bank,  and  (viii)  operational  principles  of  a  fund \nmanagement company. Subsequently, the SSC licensed Vietnam Securities Investment Fund to \nbegin operations in March 2004 (policy action subprogram III, D. 2). The closed-end fund has \nmobilized D300 billion, the ceiling as of 20 May 2004.  \n \n72.  Decree 144 also acknowledges the establishment of a securities association to operate \non a voluntary, self-regulated, and self-funded basis. Promoting and recognizing a securities \nindustry association is a policy condition under FSPL II (subprogram II, D. 5). The Vietnam \nStock Exchange Business Association was established under Decision 29/QD-BNV, dated 11 \nJune 2003, by the Minister of Home Affairs. The first general meeting of the Securities Business \nAssociation was held on 17 December 2003. All 14 securities brokers are now members of the \nassociation. \n \n4.  Financial Infrastructure \n73.  FSPL II also proposes to strengthen Vietnam Accounting and Auditing Association's \n(VAA's)  role  within  the  private  sector,  which  is  constituted  predominantly  of  SMEs.  The \nEnterprise Law of 2000 requires the adoption of the Vietnamese Accounting System, but most \nSMEs lack the capacity to adopt it. FSPL II requires that MOF support establishment and ", "    15 \ndevelopment  of  an  accounting  assistance  center  for  SMEs  under  the  VAA  (policy  action \nsubprogram II, E-1. 5). With the support of MOF, an assistance center has been housed within \nthe newly refurbished VAA and 10 training courses are being provided. It is estimated that more \nthan 1,300 SME staff have attended these training courses. \n \n74.  Also, at the time FSPL II was being prepared, many accounting firms were owned by the \ngovernment. MOF was both regulator and owner of accounting firms, raising the possibility that \na  competitive  market  could  be  compromised.  Accordingly,  FSPL  II  supported \nprivatization/equitization of state-owned auditing firms (policy action subprogram III, E-1. 1). \nDuring FSPL II\u2014subprogram I implementation, MOF took steps to equitize several state-owned \nauditing firms and to change the corporate structure of VACO, the country\u2019s largest auditing \ncompany. One state-owned auditing firm, A&C, was equitized in accordance with Decision \n721/QB-BTC of 2 April 2003. The equitization was completed in the fourth quarter of 2003. Two \nothers,  AFC  and  AASC,  are  undergoing  the  required  administrative  procedures  for \ntransformation of their ownership. VACO's transformation into a one-member limited liability \ncompany was endorsed by the MOF under Decision 1927/QD-BTC issued on 30 June 2003 and \nthe auditing firm officially became a one-member limited liability company as of 1 January 2004. \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n75.  The Government has shown strong commitment to undertaking policy actions agreed to \nunder  FSPL  II.  Throughout  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  I,  steady  progress  has  been  made  in \nimplementing  the  overall  program  and  fulfilling  the  policy  conditions  in  line  with  program \nobjectives. However, completing policy measures required significantly more time than originally \nenvisioned.  Implementing  agencies  required  more  time  to  understand  concepts  and \nmechanisms that were new to the country. Furthermore, mandatory consensus building before \nactual reform implementation proved time-consuming. Technical inputs were indispensable in \nenacting rules and regulations such as the anti-money-laundering decree and revised circulars \non accounting systems for insurance companies. The TAs ensured that best practices were \nincorporated  and  consolidated  throughout  the  consultation  period  to  achieve  the  intended \nresults.  \n \n76.  Fostering  a  solid  understanding  of  the  underlying  concepts  and  mechanisms  for \nmodernizing the financial system and ensuring consultation with all stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector, are assessed as having a long-term positive impact on the sustainability of \nprogram outputs. Given the experience of FSPL II\u2014subprogram I, and specifically the need for \nconsensus building, more time has been allocated to meet specific policy measures for tranche \nreleases under subprogram II, allowing time for consultation particularly with the relevant private \nsector stakeholders. \n \n77.  While progress was good in some areas of the Government's planned reforms, others \nconfronted formidable challenges, such as those related to SOCB and SOE restructuring. For \nexample, by mid-2002, most interest rates had been liberalized and the Government's priority \nshifted to developing the money market by issuing short-term treasury bills on a regular basis \nand  improving  SOCBs\u2019  treasury  function.  FSPL  II  supports  developing  money  market \ninstruments such as certificates of deposit and short-term treasury bills and improving the \nmarket structure by introducing money brokerage firms to penetrate through the segmented \nbanking sector. However, SOCBs\u2019 commercial orientation must significantly improve for active \nsecondary  trade  on  the  money  market  to  take  place.  While  SOCBs'  operational  and \norganizational restructuring is outside the scope of FSPL II, delays in banking sector reforms \nwere identified as a risk factor at the time of program formulation. This was to be mitigated ", "16   \nthrough the comprehensive reform package formulated with the assistance from World Bank \nunder its poverty reduction support credit (PRSC). ADB will continue to consult IMF and World \nBank on measures to strengthen SOCBs' commercial orientation and treasury function during \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II. ADB's participation in PRSC would have the potential of providing an \neffective platform for developing yet closer cooperation with the World Bank and other bilateral \ndonors involved in banking sector reforms. \n \n78.  SOE restructuring has also experienced delays, with a number of implications for FSPL \nII. The most prominent issue has been the quantity and quality of companies listed on the \nHCMC  STC.  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  has  two  policy  measures  under  the  capital  market \ncomponent for increasing the number of listed state-owned enterprises. One policy measure \ncalls for SCERD, in cooperation with SSC, to issue a list of SOEs that are candidates for listing \n(policy action subprogram II, D. 1). The second policy action requires companies meeting listing \ncriteria to disclose the same information as listed companies in order to prevent regulatory \narbitrage (policy action subprogram II, D. 3). An assessment of SOE restructuring concluded \nthat proposing policy actions to complement the latest developments in SOE reform would be \nmore meaningful. As consensus on the broad framework on SOE restructuring is established, \ntargeting  a specific  group  of  SOEs  to  move  forward,  and  possibly  to  list,  would  be  more \nrelevant.  The  two  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  policy  actions  relating  to  listing  of  SOEs  and \ndisclosure of information have therefore been refined (paras. 88-90). \n   \nC.  Refined Policy Framework and Actions for Subprogram II \n79.  The Government requested to combine FSPL II\u2014subprograms II and III (in accordance \nwith paragraph 94 of FSPL II RRP) during the 2004 country programming mission (12-27 April \n2004). The request was made on the basis of (i) relatively small loan sizes, and (ii) more \ncertainty in completing specific policy actions. \n \n80.  FSPL  II\u2014subprograms  II  and  III  are  proposed  to  be  consolidated  into  a  single \nsubprogram with three tranches. In formulating the subprogram, all policy actions proposed \nunder the FSPL II cluster were discussed with the Government. Essentially all policy actions \nthat  were  proposed  in  subprograms  II  and  III  have  been  maintained.  (For  details  see \nRefinements under Proposed Subprogram II in Appendix 4.)  \n \n81.  Under the insurance component, proposed revisions comprise (i) exclusion of one policy \naction on an approval system for opening new branches and representative offices of insurance \ncompanies, (ii) replacing one policy action for strengthening corporate governance with two \npolicy  actions  specifically  addressing  concerns  of  the  current  operations  of  the  insurance \nindustry, (iii) adding one policy action on strengthening supervision and prudential regulation, \nand (iv) adding a new policy action on enhancing industry professionals. \n \n82.  Under the capital markets component, a policy action for broadening the capital market \nbase and another policy action for establishing a consolidated regulatory framework have been \nrefined to better reflect developments in SOE restructuring and progress in the Government's \nplans to upgrade the legal framework of the capital market.  \n \n83.  Under the component for improving the financial infrastructure, minor refinements have \nbeen made for establishing the secured transactions systems and strengthening the deposit \ninsurance corporation, taking into account the progress made by the Government and specific \nbottlenecks found during FSPL II\u2014subprogram I implementation. In terms of preventing money ", "    17 \nlaundering, more specificity have been added to the policy action on establishing the financial \nintelligence unit, reflecting the Government's advanced understanding of the requirements. \n \n84.  A complete set of reforms to be implemented in FSPL II\u2014subprogram II is in the Policy \nMatrix (Appendix 5). Policy actions that have been refined or added to reflect the Government's \nachievements,  the  evolving  policy  environment,  and  lessons  learned  from  subprogram  I \nimplementation are discussed in detail below.  \n \n1.  Insurance Sector \n85.  Policy actions under the insurance component were revised to consider the sector\u2019s \ngrowth, which has given rise to the need to strengthen corporate governance and prudential \nregulations. The policy action proposed for development and introduction of an approval system \nfor opening new branches and representative offices of insurance companies and insurance \nbrokers (policy action subprogram II, A. 1) was sufficiently covered under the revised Circular 71 \nand is excluded from the newly formulated FSPL II\u2014subprogram II.   \n \n86.  To strengthen corporate governance, a policy action requiring MOF to submit a plan to \nthe Government to improve corporate governance, including ownership structure of state-owned \ninsurance companies and joint stock insurance companies (policy action subprogram III, A. 3), \nis replaced by two policy actions. The two new policy actions address specific concerns of the \ncurrent operations within the insurance industry. The first is the lack of reliability of annual \naccounts, and the second is the absence of institutional frameworks to monitor and control risks \ninherent to the sector. The newly formulated FSPL II\u2014subprogram II policy actions proposes to \nenhance corporate governance of insurance companies by MOF by (i) requiring insurance \ncompanies to  have  the  annual  accounts cosigned  by  an  MOF  authorized  auditor;  and  (ii) \nrecommending that insurance companies adopt compliance manuals and establish compliance \ncommittees,  audit  committees,  and  risk  management  committees  by  holding  seminars, \nworkshops, and publishing reference materials on MOF\u2019s web site. \n \n87.  To strengthen supervision and prudential regulations, a policy condition has been added \nencouraging MOF to introduce regulations requiring signoff of reserves in the annual accounts \nby  an  actuary  approved  by  MOF.  A  policy  action  mandating  that  at  least  50%  of  MOF\u2019s \nInsurance Department staff complete insurance-related courses at the Finance Institute or other \nMOF-recognized institutes is now included under FSPL II\u2014subprogram II. \n \n2.  Capital Market \n88.  Two policy actions under the capital markets component have been refined to ensure \nthat concrete actions are taken toward meeting the program objectives of broadening the capital \nmarket base and establishing a consolidated regulatory framework. The two original policy \nactions are (i) the SCERD, in cooperation with SSC, issue a list of SOEs that are candidates for \nlisting (policy action subprogram II, D.1); and (ii) MPI, together with SSC, require joint-stock \ncompanies  that  meet  listing  requirements  to  disclose  the  same  information  as  the  listed \ncompanies to the National Business Information Center (policy action subprogram II, D.3).  \n \n89.  SCERD has prepared a list of more than 200 companies with registered capital of more \nthan D10 billion as candidates for listing, but whether these companies will actually list is \nuncertain. The Government has prepared concrete plans for SOE equitization. However, the \noption to list must be considered by the SOEs themselves in the process of equitization, \nparticularly large SOEs with the potential to benefit from listing. To make listing attractive for ", "18   \nSOEs, the newly formulated FSPL II\u2014subprogram II requires that SSC, in cooperation with \nMOF, revise Decree 64 on SOE equitization to provide incentives for equitizing SOEs to list. \n \n90.  Furthermore, to consolidate the regulatory framework and surveillance system, SSC \nplans to draft a securities and exchange law for submission to the National Assembly in 2007. \nEnactment of a securities and exchange law is a welcome move given the capital markets\u2019 \nfragmented legal framework and the limited effectiveness of a decree as a legal basis for capital \nmarket  operations.  SSC  is  expected  to  be  given  more  concrete  legal  power  to  undertake \nsupervision, surveillance, and enforcement of laws over the securities market. To support the \nSSC in this endeavor, FSPL II\u2014subprogram II includes a policy action to draft and submit the \nsecurities and exchange law to the Government which would include (i) corporate disclosure \nrequirements; and (ii) supervisory, investigation, surveillance, and enforcement mechanisms. \nDisincentives for listing on the HCMC STC, such as requiring substantially more corporate \ndisclosure than unlisted companies, will be addressed in a comprehensive manner under the \nsecurities and exchange law. \n \n3.  Financial Infrastructure \na.  Secured Transactions System \n91.  MOJ was to continue implementing the registry of secured transactions in three other \nprovinces and cities under central management on the basis of a centralized, and networked \nregistration system. It was also tasked with building a national database system for secured \ntransactions (policy action subprogram II, E-2. 6). FSPL II also supports MOJ in submitting a \ndraft law or ordinance on registration of secured transactions to the National Assembly (policy \naction subprogram III, E-2, 2). The Government has determined that an ordinance will be issued \nfor secured transactions, incorporating all procedural matters related to registration of secured \ntransactions. Rather than continuing with registration system expansion, it is important for MOJ \nto take stock of all activities of current registries to improve the system and ensure that the \nordinance submitted in 2005 supports those improvements. Accordingly, the two conditions \nwere revised as follows: (i) MOJ to undertake a comprehensive review on the experience of \noperating registries and list specific measures for increasing the use of the registration system; \nand (ii) MOJ to submit a draft ordinance on registration of secured transactions to the Standing \nCommittee of the National Assembly, containing all procedural requirements for registration. \n \nb.  Deposit Insurance \n92.  FSPL II also revisits the issue of phasing out people's credit funds from DIV coverage. \nThe  original  policy  condition  required  the  Government  to  consider  revising  the  Decree  on \nDeposit  Insurance  to  gradually  remove  people's  credit  funds  from  DIV  coverage  once  the \nsystem safety fund, which will serve to cover depositors of failed people's credit funds, is fully \noperational (policy action subprogram III, E-3. 3). However, little progress has been made in \nestablishing and operationalizing the system safety funds. Both DIV and SBV stressed the need \nto conduct a more detailed and pragmatic study on the different models before proceeding with \nthe establishment of the system safety fund. Given the importance of this issue and the need for \ncareful planning, the newly formulated FSPL II\u2014subprogram II sequences measures to phase \nout people's credit funds in two steps: (i) to complete a feasibility study for determining the \nappropriate  model  for  depositor  protection  in  people's  credit  funds  (subprogram  II  second \ntranche release condition), and (ii) the Government to approve a funded system for depositor \nprotection in people's credit funds (subprogram II third tranche release condition). \n ", "    19 \nc.  Anti-money Laundering  \n93.  Subsequent to the issuance of the Anti-Money Laundering Decree, it was agreed that \nconcrete steps should be taken to establish a financial intelligence unit. Two conditions were \nadded to strengthen the anti-money-laundering component, specifically for the purposes of \nestablishing and operationalizing the financial intelligence unit. The newly formulated FSPL II\u2014\nsubprogram  II  supports  the  Government  in  establishing  and  operationalizing  the  financial \nintelligence unit with adequate staffing and internal procedures. The compliance programs will \nbe developed in consultation with the private sector.  \n \n94.  Furthermore,  the  policy  action  to  join  an  international  organization  for  anti-money-\nlaundering activities was upgraded to require full membership rather than observer status. \nJoining APG will help Viet Nam gain recognition from the international community as a country \nwith a firm commitment to fighting money laundering and financing of terrorism. Viet Nam will \nalso benefit from the contacts, information, and training provided through such an organization. \n \nD.  Subprogram II Loan Amount and Tranches \n95.  The proposed loan for FSPL II\u2014subprogram II will comprise an ADB loan of $35 million \nequivalent from ADF. Subprogram II will be released in three tranches: (i) $10 million equivalent \nfrom ADF upon compliance with the first tranche conditions, (ii) $15 million equivalent from ADF \nsubject to fulfillment of second tranche release conditions, and (iii) $10 million equivalent from \nADF subject to completion of third tranche release conditions. The implementation period for \nsubprogram II is proposed to be 24 months. The first tranche is expected to be released after 6 \nmonths from loan effectiveness. Completion of policy actions for second and third tranche \nrelease is expected within 18 and 24 months, respectively, from loan effectiveness. \n \n96.  AFD has proposed to cofinance \u20ac35 million for FSPL II: \u20ac23 million for subprogram I and \n\u20ac12 million for subprogram II. AFD will disburse subprogram II in tranches simultaneously with \nADB disbursements, on the same schedule and conditions. The proceeds will be disbursed to a \nspecial account and will be used to finance costs of projects, which are directly linked to reforms \nin the financial sector, 6 according to procedures defined between AFD and the Government. \nThe  details  of  the  cofinancing  arrangement  have  been  finalized  under  a  separate  loan \nagreement between the Government and AFD. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangement \n97.  Implementation arrangements adopted for FSPL II\u2014subprogram I have been effective. \nThe procedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds \nfor subprogram II, will be the same as for subprogram I. With respect to fiduciary risk, the World \nBank  conducted  a  comprehensive  assessment  and  produced  the  Country  Financial \nAccountability Assessment (CFAA) dated 15 October 2001.7 Following the CFAA, the World \nBank has provided a PRSC, one aspect of which is to finance a public financial management \n                                                 \n6  The projects that have been identified thus far include the establishment of the Hanoi STC, training the insurance \nsector professionals at the Finance Institute, support for future financial intelligence unit, the purchase of equipment \nfor the transaction center for money market operations at the State Bank of Viet Nam, and support for the \nimplementation of the secured transactions system under the Ministry of Justice.  \n7  Country Financial Accountability Assessment indicated that there is a certain degree of fiduciary risk in the use of \npublic resources, given that the budget process is not yet transparent, public access to government financial \ninformation is limited, and effective legislative oversight is not fully in place. ", "20   \nsystem. The PRSC is currently under implementation and the Government is taking steps to \nimprove the transparency of the budget process.  \n \n1.  Program Management \n98.  SBV will continue to be the Executing Agency for FSPL II\u2014subprogram II. SBV, MOF, \nMPI,  MOJ,  SSC,  and  DIV  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  SBV  will  continue  to  be \nresponsible for the overall program implementation, including administration and disbursement \nof loan proceeds, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of semiannual progress reports. \n \n99.  A program steering committee (PSC) was formed to coordinate program implementation \namong government ministries and agencies concerned. The PSC is chaired by the deputy \ngovernor  of  SBV  and  comprises  senior  officers,  duly  empowered  to  make  decisions  on \nsubprogram II implementation, from ministries and government agencies including SBV, MOF, \nMPI, MOJ, SSC, and DIV. The program implementation and coordination unit has been formed \nwithin SBV, headed by a senior officer of SBV, and staffed with SBV officials with sufficient \nknowledge and capacity to assist the PSC and ADB. The unit will continue to be responsible for \nday-to-day implementation of subprogram II.  \n \n2.  Monitoring \n100.  ADB, jointly with AFD and in cooperation with SBV, MOF, MPI, MOJ, SSC, and DIV, has \nfielded semiannual reviews to monitor the progress in FSPL II implementation and assess the \nimpact on the structure and development of the financial sector. ADB jointly with AFD and the \nimplementing agencies will continue to conduct semiannual reviews to ascertain the progress in \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II implementation and in particular to confirm compliance with tranche \nrelease conditions. The Government, ADB, and AFD will continue to engage in active policy \ndialogue on sector issues, reforms, and other measures and advice on actions to maintain \nFSPL II\u2014subprogram II on course.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n101.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with standard \npublic procedures in Viet Nam and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to \nADB.8 Goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets will be procured in \naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \n102.  The proceeds of the FSPL II\u2014subprogram II will be disbursed for a broad range of \nimports, except for a list of ineligible items (Appendix 6). The Borrower will certify that the value \nof total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) \ndisbursements made under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount \nexpected to be disbursed during the year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1998.

In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents; \n   \n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nof FSPL II\u2014subprogram II as described in the development policy letter of FSPL \nII will continue to operate. \n \n(ii)  The Government will promptly adopt the policies and actions included in FSPL \nII\u2014subprogram II, and specified in the development policy letter of FSPL II, and \nwill ensure that such policies and actions continue to operate. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n104.  The  disbursement  of  three  tranches  under  FSPL  II\u2014subprogram  II  is  subject  to \nfulfillment  of  specified  first,  second,  and  third  tranche  release  conditions  and  satisfactory \ncompliance with the overall program, as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 5).  \n \nVII.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION \n105.  In view of the substantial progress made in the implementation of subprogram I and \nsubstantial compliance with each of the 17 conditions for release of the second tranche of \nsubprogram I, I, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of \nthe Articles of Agreement of ADB, have authorized the release of the second tranche of the \nSecond Financial Sector Program Loan\u2013\u2013subprogram I.
