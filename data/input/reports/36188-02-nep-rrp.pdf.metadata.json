Integrated  urban  environmental  improvements,  including  sewerage  and \ndrainage  systems,  solid  waste  management  facilities,  and  urban  roads  and  lanes,  will  be \nimplemented  in  Biratnagar,  Birgunj,  and  Butwal  municipalities.2 A  water  supply  development \nsubproject will also be carried out in three other municipalities\u2013Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti\u2013 \nin the Kavre valley.3 At the same time, the project will make communities more aware of health \nand  hygiene  and  the  need  to  reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle  (the  3Rs),  and  it  will  invest  in \nsmall-scale community facilities. It will also strengthen the capacity of the municipalities and the \ncentral government to manage and run the project. The environment for development work has \ngreatly improved since 2006, when the decade-long conflict ended. The experience of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  shown  that  active  community  participation  can  insulate \ndevelopment  work  from  a  country\u2019s  wider  challenges  and  thus  bring  about  effective  service \ndelivery. The scope of the project is well aligned with the priorities of the municipalities; strong \nsupport  from  stakeholders,  including  local  representatives  of  all  major  political  parties  was \nconfirmed  during  project  preparation.  The  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements \nhave  fully  taken  into  account  the  current  political  context  in  Nepal,  with  the  implementation \nexpected to proceed amid the ongoing peace process. 4 The project is also closely aligned with \nthe priorities and areas of focus under ADB\u2019s Nepal country partnership strategy,5 and supports \nthe country's peace and development through improved access to basic services.  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe  National  Urban  Policy  adopted  by  the  government  in  2007  gives  priority  to              \n\n3. \n(i)  achieving  a  balanced  national  urban  structure6 by  directing  infrastructure  development  and \ninvestment; (ii) improving the quality of urban life by building a clean, safe, and well-developed \nurban  environment;  and  (iii)  setting  up  effective  urban  management  by  empowering  capable \nlocal  institutions.  The  3-year  interim  plan  (FY2008\u2013FY2010)  under  the  policy  looks  forward  to \ngovernment  investments  in  urban  infrastructure  and  other  services,  and  to  local  institutions \n                                                 \n1   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  Nepal  in  2008  for \n\nPreparing the Secondary Towns Integrated Urban Environmental Improvement Project. \n\n2   The National Urban Policy (2007) refers to Biratnagar, Birgunj, and Butwal as possible regional economic centers \n\nin the Eastern, Central, and Western regions, respectively.  \n\n3   This subproject was to have been implemented under the ongoing Urban and Environmental Improvement Project \n(ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Urban and Environmental Improvement Project. Manila [Loan 1966-NEP]). But only the \nproject  preparatory  work  (detailed  design  and  environmental  impact  assessment)  will  be  completed  under  the \nongoing  project.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  support  for  the  physical  investment  under  the  proposed \nproject.   \n\n4  On 28 May 2010, the Constituent Assembly extended its term for one year to draft the new constitution.  \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila.  \n6   A \u201cbalanced urban structure\u201d is a state of evenly managed urban development in every development region. Every \n\nregion should have at least one regional urban center with industrial and commercial activities.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nempowered and strengthened to build a clean, safe, and prosperous urban environment. While \nproductivity  in  the  urban  areas  is  higher  and  poverty  substantially  lower,  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  service  delivery  have  fallen  behind  in  those  areas.  Public  investments  have \nnot  kept  pace  with  the  growth  of  the  urban  population,  swelled  (by  more  than  5%  yearly)  by \ninternal conflicts and the dearth of economic and employment opportunities in the countryside. \nUrban  environmental  conditions,  already  deteriorating,  have  worsened:  inaccessible  and \npoor-quality  drinking  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  uncollected  or  improperly  dumped  waste, \nwater pollution from untreated domestic and industrial wastewater, and waterlogging. Moreover, \nurban  services  outside  the  Kathmandu  valley  are  scarce. 7  As  a  result,  premature  death, \ndisease,  and  associated  economic  burdens  disproportionately  affect  the  poor  and  the \nvulnerable.  The  World  Bank  estimates  annual  urban  health  costs  related  to  inadequate  water \nand sanitation at $12 million,8 and the World Health Organization ascribes 24% of the burden of \ndisease in Nepal to environmental factors.9 Poor health saps economic growth by reducing labor \nproductivity and holding back educational attainment. \n \n4. \nFurther development in the Kathmandu valley has its physical limits. New urban centers \nwill  inevitably  emerge.  But  the  urban  environment  in  the  urban  centers  urgently  needs \nimprovement  to  make  up  the  lag  in  economic  development  in  towns  outside  the  valley  and \npromote  social  and  economic  development  in  the  regions  of  Nepal.  The  municipalities  of \nBiratnagar,  Birgunj,  and  Butwal  were  selected  for  the  project  from  13  candidate  towns  on  the \nbasis  of  (i)  economic  growth  potential,  (ii)  demand  for  urban  services,  and  (iii)  urban \nmanagement  capacity.10 Each  town  is  the  main  urban  center  of  an  industrial  corridor  and  of \nimportance in external trade.11 \n  \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s Nepal country partnership strategy, which rests on four \n5. \npillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance \nand  capacity  building,  and  climate  change  adaptation  and  environmental  sustainability. \nReflecting lessons from similar projects,12 the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically \nimprovement,  and  solid  waste \nintegrated  components  (drainage,  sewerage  and  road \nmanagement in the same area) to simplify administration and coordination; (ii) is confined to a \nfew larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the \nproject  and  create  visible  impact;  (iii)  fully  involves  stakeholders  in  project  identification  and \ndesign  from  an  early  stage;  and  (iv)  provides  capacity  development  support13 before  project \nimplementation.   \n\n                                                 \n7   According to the most recent living standard survey in Nepal, only 30.4% of households in urban areas outside the \nvalley  have  access  to  sewerage  systems  (compared  with  98.1%  in  the  valley)  and  only  24.1%  have  access  to \ngarbage  collection  and  disposal  systems  (compared  with  83.0%).

Geneva. \n10 The evaluation criteria were arrived at and the analyses made under  the project preparatory TA (footnote 1). The \ngovernment, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction, was fully engaged \nin the whole process and endorsed the conclusions. In 2008, Biratnagar had an estimated population of 199,000, \nBirgunj 157,000, and Butwal 108,000.  \n\n11 The  project  will  have  a  regional  (cross-border)  aspect.  Urban  environmental  improvements  in  Biratnagar  and \nBirgunj  will  have  positive  spillover  effects  in  India,  as  (i) many  daily  visitors  from  India  engage  in  trade,  and \n(ii) rivers going through the two municipalities immediately flow into India. (Customs points at Birgunj handled about \n80% of overseas trade in 2008, and Biratnagar, about 16%.) \n\n12  Including the ongoing Urban and Environmental Improvement Project (footnote 3).  \n13  Capacity development TA was approved in September 2009 to strengthen the capacity of Biratnagar, Birgunj, and \nButwal  municipalities  in  (i) financial  management  including  revenue  enhancement,  (ii) technical  aspects  of  urban \nservice  delivery,  and  (iii) development  of  geographic  information  system\u2013based  urban  mapping.

Manila.  \n\n\fB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  quality  of  life  and  higher  and  more  socially  inclusive \neconomic growth in key regional centers in Nepal. The expected outcome will be improved and \naffordable  municipal  services  delivered  effectively,  efficiently,  and  reliably  by  accountable \nproject municipalities.  \n\nC. \n\nOutput \n\n7. \nThe  project  will  have  two  components.  In  component  1  priority  subprojects  will  be \nimplemented  and  reliable,  affordable,  and  effective  municipal  infrastructure  developed  in  each \nmunicipality. The selection of subprojects follows the priorities set by the municipalities in their \nmunicipal  periodic  plans.14 During  detailed  design,  the  municipalities  will  assess  the  possibility \nof private sector participation in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the infrastructure from \nthe viewpoint of effective and efficient system operation, determine the appropriate form of such \nparticipation,  and  reflect  the  findings  in  the  institutional  arrangement.  The  capacity  of  the \nmunicipalities and the central government to manage and run the project will be strengthened in \ncomponent 2.  \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Developing Reliable, Affordable, and Effective Municipal \nInfrastructure  \n\nDrainage  and  sewerage.  Biratnagar  and  Birgunj,  on  the  flatland  of  the  Terai,15 are \n8. \nchronically  waterlogged  because  of  inadequate,  poorly  built,  and  poorly  maintained  drainage \nand  obstructions  from  solid  waste  dumping.  Stormwater  drainage  systems  are  being  used  as \nopen  sewers,  causing  bad  odors  and  health  risks,  and  polluting  the  watercourses.  These \nsystems  will  be  improved  together  with  wastewater  management  systems,  and  wastewater \ntreatment plants16 will be built in both municipalities. Urban roads and lanes will be restored or \nupgraded in places where work is done on drainage and sewerage pipe networks.  \n \n9. \nSolid  waste  management. Without a sanitary landfill, Birgunj and Butwal dump waste \nhaphazardly along riverbanks and into open spaces, with little recycling, causing pollution and \npublic health hazards. The project will take an integrated approach to solid waste management, \nreviewing  and  improving  the  entire  system  from  segregation  and  collection,  through  the  3Rs \n(including the composting of organic waste), to transportation and final disposal at the sanitary \nlandfill. The necessary equipment and vehicles will thus be procured and a sanitary landfill site17 \nbuilt  in  each  municipality.  A  preliminary  assessment  of  the  potential  for  using  the  Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  for  composting  has  been  made;  further  studies  will  be  done  during \ndetailed design.  \n \n10.  Water  supply.  Water  supply  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  the  municipalities  of \nBanepa,  Dhulikhel,  and  Panauti  in  the  Kavre  valley18 and  in  Butwal,  where  there  is  a  severe \nshortage.  The  Kavre  valley  subproject  will  take  a  regional  approach.  A  single  project \n\n                                                 \n14  Periodic  plans  are  medium-term  development  plans  prepared  in  a  participatory  manner  by  each  municipality,  in \ncompliance  with  the  Local  Self  Governance  Act  (1999).  A  periodic  plan  was  prepared  in  Biratnagar  in  2007  and \nBirgunj in 2009, and is being prepared in Butwal.  \n15  The Terai is the southern plain area bordering India. \n16  Waste stabilization ponds will be established as the least-cost option. In Biratnagar, a reed-bed treatment plant will \n\nalso be built.  \n\n17  The  site  will  be  developed  as  an  integrated  resource  recovery  center  to  optimize  resource  recovery,  although \n\nfacilities for resource recovery are not part of the project.  \n\n18  The three municipalities in the Kavre valley had a total population of about 59,000 in 2009.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nOther \n\nimplementation unit (PIU) will be formed to implement the project, and the Kavre Water Supply \nManagement Board19 will be created to take charge of O&M.  \n \n11. \ninfrastructure.  Auto-related  enterprises  (workshops;  motor  parts  makers, \npainters, welders, repairers) have clustered in Butwal, at the strategic juncture of the East\u2013West \nHighway  and  the  Siddhartha  Highway  (north\u2013south  corridor).  The  project  will  improve  basic \ninfrastructure  such  as  roads,  wastewater  management,  and  water  supply  in  this  auto  industry \nzone (auto village) through public\u2013private partnership.  \n \n12. \nCommunity  development  programs.  This  subcomponent  will  consist  mainly  of \n(i) health  and  hygiene  education  in  communities  and  schools, 20 particularly  for  women  and \nvulnerable  groups  including  the  poor;  (ii)  household  and  community  3R  activities,  particularly \norganic  waste  composting;  (iii)  skills  training,  mainly  for  the  poor;  and  (iv)  investment  in \nsmall-scale facilities that are community priorities, such as public, school, and community toilets \nand communal water taps, to achieve social inclusiveness and improve sanitation in Biratnagar, \nBirgunj, and Butwal municipalities.21 A portion of this subcomponent could be devoted to making \nit  easier  for  the  poor  to  connect  to  sanitation  (mainly  for  on-site  sanitation)  and  water  supply \nservices with the help of performance-based grants such as output-based aid.22 As the project \nwill  bring  tangible  benefits  to  women  through  better  access  to  municipal  services  and  more \nmeaningful participation, it is classified as effective gender mainstreaming (para. 26).  \n \n13. \nConsulting  services  for  design,  construction  supervision,  and  support  for  the  initial \noperation of facilities for the above subcomponents (except community development programs) \nwill also be part of this component. The services will include (i) the development of the technical \ncapacity of municipal staff to carry out O&M of the facilities built under the project; (ii) support in \nsetting  and  collecting  adequate  tariffs,  taxes,  and  other  charges  to  ensure  that  enough  is \nallocated  in  the  budget  for  O&M,  repayment  to  the  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF), \nreplacement,  and  future  expansion;  and  (iii)  assessment  of  the  possibility  of  private  sector \nparticipation in service delivery and its appropriate form. Local nongovernment organizations will \nbe hired to assist in the community development programs.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Strengthening the Capacity of Municipalities and the Central \nGovernment for Project Management and Operation  \n\n14. \nThis  component  will  support  the  smooth  and  effective  implementation  and  operation  of \nthe project. Project municipalities will be provided with capacity development programs sufficient \nfor  the  creation  or  strengthening  of  institutions  such  as  the  units  responsible  for  O&M.23 To \nestablish the Kavre Water Supply Management Board and make it operational, support will be \nprovided in (i) asset valuation and transfer, (ii) institutional development including the drafting of \nregulations and a business plan, and (iii) system integration.  \n\n                                                 \n19 According to the Water Supply Management Board Act (2006).  \n20 The program will follow the community-led or school-led total sanitation approach.  \n21 Subprojects to be prepared after Board approval, including the water supply suproject in Butwal, will conform to the \n\nsubproject selection criteria described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.  \n\n22 An  appropriate  mechanism  for  output-based  aid  is  being  studied  under  the  ongoing  Second  Small  Towns  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project. ADB. 2009.

Manila (Grant 0157-NEP). Under output-based aid, those eligible for grants will first be \ndetermined. Eligible beneficiaries or municipalities will prefinance a part of the connection costs (private latrines or \nwater supply), and will later be reimbursed the grant amounts after the intended outputs have been confirmed by \nverification parties such as local nongovernment organizations.  \n\n23 Since  May  2010  a  separate  team  of  consultants  has  been  assisting  municipalities  in  institutional  strengthening \n\nunder the capacity development TA (footnote 13).  \n\n\fD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n15. \nThe  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $106.3  million.

The loan from ADB will finance (i) a part of civil works costs, (ii) consulting \nservices, (iii) a part of incremental recurrent government staff costs, and (iv) financing charges \nduring  implementation.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n17. \nThe government has also requested OFID to jointly finance the sewerage and drainage \ncivil  works  with  a  loan  of  $17  million.  The  OFID  loan,  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  will  have  a \nmaturity of 20 years with a grace period of 5 years, and will carry interest of 1.0% per annum \nand  a  service  charge  of  1.0%.  ADB  typically  seeks  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of \ncofinancing from cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place.  In the case of \nthe  proposed  loan  from  OFID,  approval  is  anticipated  during  June  2010.  To  facilitate  Project \nimplementation,  the  Board  is  requested  to  approve  the  administration  of  the  proposed  loan, \nwhich  is  expected  to  be  confirmed  close  to  or  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval.  \nApproval  of  the  OFID  loan  will  be  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the  standard \nreporting procedures.  In the unlikely event that the OFID does not provide cofinancing within 6 \nmonths  of  the  effective  date  of  the  loan  agreement,  the  government  will  make  available  all \ncounterpart funds required for the timely and effective completion of the project, either through \n\n                                                 \n24  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nbudget  allocations  or  through  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB;  otherwise,  the \ngovernment  and  ADB  will  agree  to  scale  down  the  project,  and  if  applicable  to  adjust  the \nrelevant financing arrangements. The government will provide $19.7 million equivalent to cover \n(i)  taxes  and  duties,  (ii)  a  part  of  civil  works  costs,  (iii)  a  part  of  incremental  recurrent \ngovernment  staff  costs,  and  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  The  municipalities \n(including beneficiaries) will contribute $9.6 million equivalent.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund for International Development   \nGovernment \nMunicipalities and beneficiaries \n \n\nTotal \n\nSource: ADB estimates.  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n60.00 \n17.00 \n19.72 \n9.61 \n106.33 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n56.43 \n15.99 \n18.54 \n9.04 \n100.00 \n\n \n\n \nThe  government  will  relend  about  $12.7  million  of  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  TDF25 at  a \n18. \nproposed interest rate of 2%\u20133% per annum for a term of 20\u201323 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, through a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nThe government will assume the foreign exchange risk. The TDF will in turn provide subloans to \nthe municipalities at an interest rate of not more than 5% per annum and a maturity of 20 years \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  through  onlending  agreements  on  terms  and  conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. The balance of the loan amount ($47.3 million) will be channeled through \nthe  government  to  the  municipalities  as  a  grant  portion,  to  cover  subproject  investment  costs, \nconsulting  services,  and  other  costs  of  the  project.  Most  subprojects  will  be  financed  in  part \nthrough  the  TDF  subloans  and  in  part  through  government  financing  of  the  municipalities  and \nother  sources;  in  respect  of  all  subprojects,  the  government  will  manage  approval  and \nimplementation. \n \n19. \nCost-sharing  arrangements  between  the  government  and  the  municipalities,  and  the \nrelative  share  of  subloan  proceeds  and  municipal  cash  contribution,  will  vary  between \nsubcomponents  (drainage  and  sewerage,  solid  waste,  and  water  supply)  in  line  with \ngovernment  policy,  prevailing  practices  in  the  country,  and  the  possibility  of  direct  cost \nrecovery.26  \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nThe  executing  agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works,  working \nthrough its Department of Urban Development and Building Construction. It will set up a project \ncoordination office (PCO) to be headed by the project director. Biratnagar, Birgunj, and Butwal \nmunicipalities, each with a PIU headed by a project manager, will be the implementing agencies \nfor  the  subprojects.  Another  PIU,  comprising  representatives  from  Banepa,  Dhulikhel,  and \nPanauti municipalities, will be created for the Kavre valley water supply subproject.  \n \n\n                                                 \n25 The  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF)  is  a  government-owned  autonomous  body  established  under  the  TDF  Act \n(1997) that provides financial, technical, and institutional support to institutions engaged in town development. The \nTDF has satisfactory financial management arrangements and project accounting systems in place, gained through \nexperience working on ADB projects in the past.  \n\n26  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n\fThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n21. \nthe  PAM.

An  economic \nanalysis  of  the  combined  public  investment  in  each  municipality  measured  the  consequent \nreduction in the occurrence of waterborne diseases and the private health-care cost and found \nthese  to  be  economically  viable.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  range  from  13.9%  to \n                                                 \n27  Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n23.2%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital. Moreover, underestimation of the \neconomic returns is likely because only a portion of the benefits can be captured in numerical \nvalues. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  brought  out  common  financial  management \n23. \npractices among the implementing agencies. A sound financial management system is in place, \nalthough  the  implementing  agencies  still  use  a  cash-based  accounting  system.  The  financial \nmanagement  specialist  will  assist  the  implementing  agencies  in  maintaining  the  project \naccounts according to double-entry accrual accounting. An assessment of the financial position \nof the municipalities has found these public investments financially sustainable. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nA  governance  risk  assessment  of  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and \ncorruption in the urban development sector was made when the country partnership strategy for \nNepal  was  prepared  in  2009.  The  financial  management  risks  of  the  municipalities  are  being \naddressed  through  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (footnote  13).  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners are supporting the capacity building of relevant government agencies to \nlessen public procurement and corruption risks. Transparency, in procurement and financing as \nwell  as  other  matters,  will  be  maximized  under  the  project  to  reduce  central  and  local \ngovernment risks. \n  \n25. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  has  been  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  improvements  to  be \nmade  in  drainage  and  sewerage  infrastructure  and  solid  waste  management  systems  will \nproduce significant public health benefits for the community in general, including the poor. While \ndrainage and sewerage system improvement will not cover the entire municipal areas, the poor \nliving  in  the  peripheral  areas  will  also  benefit  from  the  project,  as  community  development \nprograms  will  be  directed  at  women  and  vulnerable  groups  including  the  poor.  Small-scale \nfacilities,  such  as  communal  water  taps  and  communal  toilets  that  will  give  the  poor  better \naccess to water supply and sanitation, will be supported. The promotion of 3R programs is also \nexpected to benefit the poor and women. These programs will be participatory, with women and \nvulnerable groups appropriately represented. A gender equality and social inclusion action plan \nwill  be  implemented  to  ensure  inclusiveness  in  the  project  and  address  the  different  needs  of \nwomen and vulnerable groups. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  category  B  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \n27. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies \nprepared  initial  environmental  examinations,  including  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs), for the subprojects during the feasibility study. Specific locations were identified for all \nmajor infrastructure and facilities; for some small-scale facilities, such as water supply in Butwal \nand  community  and  school  toilets,  the  locations  will  be  fixed  after  Board  approval.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework was therefore also prepared. The framework \nsets  out  the  requirements  for  project  screening  and  classification,  subproject  selection, \n\n\finformation disclosure to and consultation with the affected people, environmental assessment, \nEMP development and implementation, and monitoring and reporting. The initial environmental \nexaminations found the planned subprojects to have only small and localized adverse impact on \nthe environment, which can be mitigated with the mitigation measures proposed in the EMPs. \nOn  the  other  hand,  the  improvements  in  drainage  and  sewerage  systems  and  in  solid  waste \nmanagement  will  have  significant  positive  impact  on  community  hygiene  and  sanitation.  The \nEMPs will be implemented by the PIUs and the implementation will be monitored by the PCO. \nDesign and supervision consultants will assist the PIUs in implementing the EMPs.  \n \n28. \nSocial safeguards. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement and category \nB  for  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Several \nsubprojects \ninvoluntary \nresettlement impact is not considered significant.28 Draft resettlement plans have been prepared \nfor  these  subprojects  in  compliance  with  the  government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements.  A \nresettlement framework has also been prepared. The PCO will see to it that the PIUs update the \nresettlement plan, if needed, during detailed design and implement the final resettlement plan. \nConsidering the nature and scale of these subprojects, the impact on indigenous peoples will be \nlimited to a few involuntary resettlement and land acquisition cases. The draft resettlement plan \nincludes  an  indigenous  peoples  plan,  and  the  resettlement  framework  includes  an  indigenous \npeoples planning framework, with special assistance measures for indigenous people and other \nvulnerable  groups.  As  sanitation  services  improve,  so  will  the  health  benefits  for  indigenous \npeople.  In  addition,  the  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  plan  contains  specific  actions \nfavorable to indigenous people.  \n\ninvoluntary  resettlement,  but \n\nland  acquisition  and \n\ninvolve \n\nthe \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The major risks, such \nas  political  instability,  the  continued  absence  of  elected  mayors,  and  frequent  transfer  of \nexecutive  officers  in  municipalities,  can  be  mitigated  to  a  manageable  level.  The  intended \nbenefits and impact of the project are therefore expected to outweigh the costs.   \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk \nTransition to a federal structure, the peace \nprocess, and the political instability related \nto these may cause frequent strikes in \nparticular in the Terai, and may delay \ndecentralization and devolution.  \n\nThe continued absence of elected mayors \nand frequent transfer of executive officers \nin municipalities deputed from the Ministry \nof Local Development may undermine \ntop-level commitment and delay decision \nmaking. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nDevelopment partners will maintain close dialogue with the \ngovernment and all political parties to ensure that the development \nand reform process is not derailed and keeps its momentum beyond \nthe political challenges. The direction of federalism being deliberated \nis in line with increased roles and functions of local governments. \n\nStrong support of stakeholders, including local representatives of all \nmajor political parties, was confirmed during project preparation. ADB \nexperience shows that active community participation in all major \nsteps can ensure effective service delivery by insulating development \nwork from the country\u2019s wider challenges. In general, political parties \nare united for local development and committed to resolving the \nconstraints on project implementation. \n\nMunicipalities may default on subloans \nfrom TDF.  \n\nSubloans to municipalities will be relatively small, given the nature of \nthe subprojects and the repayment capacity of the municipalities. \n\nThe TDF, which has a wealth of experience in financing the \nmunicipalities, will adequately assess the repayment capacity of \nmunicipalities. Revenue enhancement of municipalities is being \n\n                                                 \n28  Involuntary  resettlement  impact  is  considered  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impact. \n\u201cMajor impact\u201d involves (i) physically displacing people from housing; or (ii) causing people to lose 10% or more of \ntheir productive, income-generating assets.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisk \n\nsupported under capacity development TA.  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe government will bear the credit risk of the onlending by TDF to the \nmunicipalities, with an undertaking to TDF in the subsidiary loan \nagreement to cover default amounts from central funds otherwise \ndesignated for support to the relevant municipalities, and with \nagreement thereto by the relevant municipalities in the onlending \nagreements.  \n\nUrban environmental management guidelines are undergoing \ngovernment approval. The project steering committee will monitor the \nprogress of enforcement of the guidelines. Coordination with SEAM-Na \nfor effective industrial pollution control will continue. \n\nIndustrial wastewater flowing into \nmunicipalities remains untreated, \njeopardizing sanitation improvement. \n\nSEAM-N = Strengthening of Environmental Administration at the Local Level in Nepal (funded by the Government of \nFinland), TA = technical assistance, TDF = Town Development Fund. \na  Implemented  in  the  eastern  region  (including  Biratnagar).
