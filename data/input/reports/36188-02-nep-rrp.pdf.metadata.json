I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the OPEC Fund for \nInternational Development (OFID), both to Nepal for the Secondary Towns Integrated Urban \nEnvironmental Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The project1 will improve the quality of life in key regional centers in Nepal and help \nachieve higher and more socially inclusive economic growth in those centers through effective, \nefficient, and reliable delivery of improved and affordable municipal services by accountable \nproject municipalities. Integrated urban environmental improvements, including sewerage and \ndrainage  systems,  solid  waste  management  facilities,  and  urban  roads  and  lanes,  will  be \nimplemented in Biratnagar, Birgunj, and Butwal municipalities.2 A water supply development \nsubproject will also be carried out in three other municipalities\u2013Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti\u2013 \nin the Kavre valley.3 At the same time, the project will make communities more aware of health \nand  hygiene  and  the  need  to  reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle  (the  3Rs),  and  it  will  invest  in \nsmall-scale community facilities. It will also strengthen the capacity of the municipalities and the \ncentral government to manage and run the project. The environment for development work has \ngreatly improved since 2006, when the decade-long conflict ended. The experience of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  shown  that  active  community  participation  can  insulate \ndevelopment work from a country\u2019s wider challenges and thus bring about effective service \ndelivery. The scope of the project is well aligned with the priorities of the municipalities; strong \nsupport from stakeholders, including local representatives of all major political parties was \nconfirmed during project preparation. The project design and implementation arrangements \nhave fully taken into account the current political context in Nepal, with the implementation \nexpected to proceed amid the ongoing peace process. 4 The project is also closely aligned with \nthe priorities and areas of focus under ADB\u2019s Nepal country partnership strategy,5 and supports \nthe country's peace and development through improved access to basic services.  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  National  Urban  Policy  adopted  by  the  government  in  2007  gives  priority  to              \n(i) achieving a balanced national urban structure6 by directing infrastructure development and \ninvestment; (ii) improving the quality of urban life by building a clean, safe, and well-developed \nurban environment; and (iii) setting up effective urban management by empowering capable \nlocal institutions. The 3-year interim plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010) under the policy looks forward to \ngovernment investments in urban infrastructure and other services, and to local institutions \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to Nepal in 2008 for \nPreparing the Secondary Towns Integrated Urban Environmental Improvement Project. \n2   The National Urban Policy (2007) refers to Biratnagar, Birgunj, and Butwal as possible regional economic centers \nin the Eastern, Central, and Western regions, respectively.  \n3   This subproject was to have been implemented under the ongoing Urban and Environmental Improvement Project \n(ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Urban and Environmental Improvement Project. Manila [Loan 1966-NEP]). But only the \nproject preparatory work (detailed design and environmental impact assessment) will be completed under the \nongoing project. The government has requested ADB support for the physical investment under the proposed \nproject.   \n4  On 28 May 2010, the Constituent Assembly extended its term for one year to draft the new constitution.  \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila.  \n6  A \u201cbalanced urban structure\u201d is a state of evenly managed urban development in every development region. Every \nregion should have at least one regional urban center with industrial and commercial activities.  ", "2 \nempowered and strengthened to build a clean, safe, and prosperous urban environment. While \nproductivity  in  the  urban  areas  is  higher  and  poverty  substantially  lower,  infrastructure \ndevelopment and service delivery have fallen behind in those areas. Public investments have \nnot kept pace with the growth of the urban population, swelled (by more than 5% yearly) by \ninternal conflicts and the dearth of economic and employment opportunities in the countryside. \nUrban  environmental  conditions,  already  deteriorating,  have  worsened:  inaccessible  and \npoor-quality drinking water and sanitation facilities, uncollected or improperly dumped waste, \nwater pollution from untreated domestic and industrial wastewater, and waterlogging. Moreover, \nurban  services  outside  the  Kathmandu  valley  are  scarce.7 As  a  result,  premature  death, \ndisease,  and  associated  economic  burdens  disproportionately  affect  the  poor  and  the \nvulnerable. The World Bank estimates annual urban health costs related to inadequate water \nand sanitation at $12 million,8 and the World Health Organization ascribes 24% of the burden of \ndisease in Nepal to environmental factors.9 Poor health saps economic growth by reducing labor \nproductivity and holding back educational attainment. \n \n4.  Further development in the Kathmandu valley has its physical limits. New urban centers \nwill  inevitably  emerge.  But  the  urban  environment  in  the  urban  centers  urgently  needs \nimprovement to make up the lag in economic development in towns outside the valley and \npromote  social  and  economic  development  in  the  regions  of  Nepal.  The  municipalities  of \nBiratnagar, Birgunj, and Butwal were selected for the project from 13 candidate towns on the \nbasis  of  (i)  economic  growth  potential,  (ii)  demand  for  urban  services,  and  (iii)  urban \nmanagement capacity.10 Each town is the main urban center of an industrial corridor and of \nimportance in external trade.11 \n  \n5.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Nepal country partnership strategy, which rests on four \npillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance \nand  capacity  building,  and  climate  change  adaptation  and  environmental  sustainability. \nReflecting lessons from similar projects,12 the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically \nintegrated  components  (drainage,  sewerage  and  road  improvement,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement in the same area) to simplify administration and coordination; (ii) is confined to a \nfew larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the \nproject and create visible impact; (iii) fully involves stakeholders in project identification and \ndesign from an early stage; and (iv) provides capacity development support13 before project \nimplementation.   \n                                                 \n7   According to the most recent living standard survey in Nepal, only 30.4% of households in urban areas outside the \nvalley have access to sewerage systems (compared with 98.1% in the valley) and only 24.1% have access to \ngarbage collection and disposal systems (compared with 83.0%).

Country Profiles of Environmental Burden of Disease. Geneva. \n10 The evaluation criteria were arrived at and the analyses made under the project preparatory TA (footnote 1). The \ngovernment, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction, was fully engaged \nin the whole process and endorsed the conclusions. In 2008, Biratnagar had an estimated population of 199,000, \nBirgunj 157,000, and Butwal 108,000.  \n11 The project will have a regional (cross-border) aspect. Urban environmental improvements in Biratnagar and \nBirgunj will have positive spillover effects in India, as (i) many daily visitors from India engage in trade, and \n(ii) rivers going through the two municipalities immediately flow into India. (Customs points at Birgunj handled about \n80% of overseas trade in 2008, and Biratnagar, about 16%.) \n12  Including the ongoing Urban and Environmental Improvement Project (footnote 3).  \n13  Capacity development TA was approved in September 2009 to strengthen the capacity of Biratnagar, Birgunj, and \nButwal municipalities in (i) financial management including revenue enhancement, (ii) technical aspects of urban \nservice delivery, and (iii) development of geographic information system\u2013based urban mapping. ADB. 2009. \nTechnical Assistance to Nepal for Institutional Strengthening of Municipalities. Manila.  \n ", "3 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  will  be  improved  quality  of  life  and  higher  and  more  socially  inclusive \neconomic growth in key regional centers in Nepal. The expected outcome will be improved and \naffordable  municipal  services  delivered  effectively,  efficiently,  and  reliably  by  accountable \nproject municipalities.  \nC.  Output \n7.  The  project  will  have  two  components.  In  component  1  priority  subprojects  will  be \nimplemented and reliable, affordable, and effective municipal infrastructure developed in each \nmunicipality. The selection of subprojects follows the priorities set by the municipalities in their \nmunicipal periodic plans.14 During detailed design, the municipalities will assess the possibility \nof private sector participation in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the infrastructure from \nthe viewpoint of effective and efficient system operation, determine the appropriate form of such \nparticipation,  and  reflect  the  findings  in  the  institutional  arrangement.  The  capacity  of  the \nmunicipalities and the central government to manage and run the project will be strengthened in \ncomponent 2.  \n1.  Component 1: Developing Reliable, Affordable, and Effective Municipal \nInfrastructure  \n8.  Drainage and sewerage. Biratnagar and Birgunj, on the flatland of the Terai,15 are \nchronically waterlogged because of inadequate, poorly built, and poorly maintained drainage \nand obstructions from solid waste dumping. Stormwater drainage systems are being used as \nopen  sewers,  causing  bad  odors  and  health  risks,  and  polluting  the  watercourses.  These \nsystems will be improved together with wastewater management systems, and wastewater \ntreatment plants16 will be built in both municipalities. Urban roads and lanes will be restored or \nupgraded in places where work is done on drainage and sewerage pipe networks.  \n \n9.  Solid waste management. Without a sanitary landfill, Birgunj and Butwal dump waste \nhaphazardly along riverbanks and into open spaces, with little recycling, causing pollution and \npublic health hazards. The project will take an integrated approach to solid waste management, \nreviewing and improving the entire system from segregation and collection, through the 3Rs \n(including the composting of organic waste), to transportation and final disposal at the sanitary \nlandfill. The necessary equipment and vehicles will thus be procured and a sanitary landfill site17 \nbuilt  in  each  municipality.  A  preliminary  assessment  of  the  potential  for  using  the  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism for composting has been made; further studies will be done during \ndetailed design.  \n \n10.  Water supply. Water supply subprojects will be implemented in the municipalities of \nBanepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti in the Kavre valley18 and in Butwal, where there is a severe \nshortage.  The  Kavre  valley  subproject  will  take  a  regional  approach.  A  single  project \n                                                 \n14  Periodic plans are medium-term development plans prepared in a participatory manner by each municipality, in \ncompliance with the Local Self Governance Act (1999). A periodic plan was prepared in Biratnagar in 2007 and \nBirgunj in 2009, and is being prepared in Butwal.  \n15  The Terai is the southern plain area bordering India. \n16  Waste stabilization ponds will be established as the least-cost option. In Biratnagar, a reed-bed treatment plant will \nalso be built.  \n17  The site will be developed as an integrated resource recovery center to optimize resource recovery, although \nfacilities for resource recovery are not part of the project.  \n18  The three municipalities in the Kavre valley had a total population of about 59,000 in 2009.  \n ", "4 \nimplementation unit (PIU) will be formed to implement the project, and the Kavre Water Supply \nManagement Board19 will be created to take charge of O&M.  \n \n11.  Other  infrastructure.  Auto-related  enterprises  (workshops;  motor  parts  makers, \npainters, welders, repairers) have clustered in Butwal, at the strategic juncture of the East\u2013West \nHighway and the Siddhartha Highway (north\u2013south corridor). The project will improve basic \ninfrastructure such as roads, wastewater management, and water supply in this auto industry \nzone (auto village) through public\u2013private partnership.  \n \n12.  Community  development  programs.  This  subcomponent  will  consist  mainly  of \n(i) health and hygiene education in communities and schools,20 particularly for women and \nvulnerable groups including the poor; (ii) household and community 3R activities, particularly \norganic  waste  composting;  (iii)  skills  training,  mainly  for  the  poor;  and  (iv)  investment  in \nsmall-scale facilities that are community priorities, such as public, school, and community toilets \nand communal water taps, to achieve social inclusiveness and improve sanitation in Biratnagar, \nBirgunj, and Butwal municipalities.21 A portion of this subcomponent could be devoted to making \nit easier for the poor to connect to sanitation (mainly for on-site sanitation) and water supply \nservices with the help of performance-based grants such as output-based aid.22 As the project \nwill bring tangible benefits to women through better access to municipal services and more \nmeaningful participation, it is classified as effective gender mainstreaming (para. 26).  \n \n13.  Consulting  services  for  design,  construction  supervision,  and  support  for  the  initial \noperation of facilities for the above subcomponents (except community development programs) \nwill also be part of this component. The services will include (i) the development of the technical \ncapacity of municipal staff to carry out O&M of the facilities built under the project; (ii) support in \nsetting and collecting adequate tariffs, taxes, and other charges to ensure that enough is \nallocated  in  the  budget  for  O&M,  repayment  to  the  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF), \nreplacement, and future expansion; and (iii) assessment of the possibility of private sector \nparticipation in service delivery and its appropriate form. Local nongovernment organizations will \nbe hired to assist in the community development programs.    \n2.  Component 2: Strengthening the Capacity of Municipalities and the Central \nGovernment for Project Management and Operation  \n14.  This component will support the smooth and effective implementation and operation of \nthe project. Project municipalities will be provided with capacity development programs sufficient \nfor the creation or strengthening of institutions such as the units responsible for O&M.23 To \nestablish the Kavre Water Supply Management Board and make it operational, support will be \nprovided in (i) asset valuation and transfer, (ii) institutional development including the drafting of \nregulations and a business plan, and (iii) system integration.  \n                                                 \n19 According to the Water Supply Management Board Act (2006).  \n20 The program will follow the community-led or school-led total sanitation approach.  \n21 Subprojects to be prepared after Board approval, including the water supply suproject in Butwal, will conform to the \nsubproject selection criteria described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.  \n22 An appropriate mechanism for output-based aid is being studied under the ongoing Second Small Towns Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project. ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Asian Development Fund Grant to Nepal for Second Small Towns Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project. Manila (Grant 0157-NEP). Under output-based aid, those eligible for grants will first be \ndetermined. Eligible beneficiaries or municipalities will prefinance a part of the connection costs (private latrines or \nwater supply), and will later be reimbursed the grant amounts after the intended outputs have been confirmed by \nverification parties such as local nongovernment organizations.  \n23 Since May 2010 a separate team of consultants has been assisting municipalities in institutional strengthening \nunder the capacity development TA (footnote 13).  \n ", "5 \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n15.  The project cost is estimated at $106.3 million. The investment plan is summarized in \nTable 1.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR40,927,000 ($60 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project (Table 2). The loan from ADB will finance (i) a part of civil works costs, (ii) consulting \nservices, (iii) a part of incremental recurrent government staff costs, and (iv) financing charges \nduring implementation. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum  during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n17.  The government has also requested OFID to jointly finance the sewerage and drainage \ncivil works with a loan of $17 million. The OFID loan, to be administered by ADB, will have a \nmaturity of 20 years with a grace period of 5 years, and will carry interest of 1.0% per annum \nand a service charge of 1.0%. ADB typically seeks Board approval for the administration of \ncofinancing from cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place.  In the case of \nthe proposed loan from OFID, approval is anticipated during June 2010. To facilitate Project \nimplementation, the Board is requested to approve the administration of the proposed loan, \nwhich is expected to be confirmed close to or subsequent to the date of Board approval.  \nApproval of the OFID loan will be reported to the Board in accordance with the standard \nreporting procedures.  In the unlikely event that the OFID does not provide cofinancing within 6 \nmonths of the effective date of the loan agreement, the government will make available all \ncounterpart funds required for the timely and effective completion of the project, either through \n                                                 \n24  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nbudget  allocations  or  through  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB;  otherwise,  the \ngovernment and ADB will agree to scale down the project, and if applicable to adjust the \nrelevant financing arrangements. The government will provide $19.7 million equivalent to cover \n(i)  taxes  and  duties,  (ii)  a  part  of  civil  works  costs,  (iii)  a  part  of  incremental  recurrent \ngovernment staff costs, and (iv) land acquisition and resettlement costs. The municipalities \n(including beneficiaries) will contribute $9.6 million equivalent.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  60.00    56.43 \nOPEC Fund for International Development    17.00    15.99 \nGovernment  19.72    18.54 \nMunicipalities and beneficiaries  9.61    9.04 \n  Total    106.33    100.00 \nSource: ADB estimates.  \n \n18.  The government will relend about $12.7 million of the loan proceeds to the TDF25 at a \nproposed interest rate of 2%\u20133% per annum for a term of 20\u201323 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, through a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \nThe government will assume the foreign exchange risk. The TDF will in turn provide subloans to \nthe municipalities at an interest rate of not more than 5% per annum and a maturity of 20 years \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, through onlending agreements on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. The balance of the loan amount ($47.3 million) will be channeled through \nthe government to the municipalities as a grant portion, to cover subproject investment costs, \nconsulting services, and other costs of the project. Most subprojects will be financed in part \nthrough the TDF subloans and in part through government financing of the municipalities and \nother  sources;  in  respect  of  all  subprojects,  the  government  will  manage  approval  and \nimplementation. \n \n19.  Cost-sharing arrangements between the government and the municipalities, and the \nrelative  share  of  subloan  proceeds  and  municipal  cash  contribution,  will  vary  between \nsubcomponents  (drainage  and  sewerage,  solid  waste,  and  water  supply)  in  line  with \ngovernment  policy,  prevailing  practices  in  the  country,  and  the  possibility  of  direct  cost \nrecovery.26  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, working \nthrough its Department of Urban Development and Building Construction. It will set up a project \ncoordination office (PCO) to be headed by the project director. Biratnagar, Birgunj, and Butwal \nmunicipalities, each with a PIU headed by a project manager, will be the implementing agencies \nfor  the  subprojects.  Another  PIU,  comprising  representatives  from  Banepa,  Dhulikhel,  and \nPanauti municipalities, will be created for the Kavre valley water supply subproject.  \n \n                                                 \n25 The Town Development Fund (TDF) is a government-owned autonomous body established under the TDF Act \n(1997) that provides financial, technical, and institutional support to institutions engaged in town development.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The public investment to be made under the project, coupled with various programs to \nincrease community awareness of sanitation and numerous community sanitation schemes, will \nhave a significant impact on the environment and public health improvement. An economic \nanalysis of the combined public investment in each municipality measured the consequent \nreduction in the occurrence of waterborne diseases and the private health-care cost and found \nthese to be economically viable. The economic internal rates of return range from 13.9% to \n                                                 \n27  Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n23.2%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital. Moreover, underestimation of the \neconomic returns is likely because only a portion of the benefits can be captured in numerical \nvalues. \n \n23.  The  financial  management  assessment  brought  out  common  financial  management \npractices among the implementing agencies. A sound financial management system is in place, \nalthough the implementing agencies still use a cash-based accounting system. The financial \nmanagement  specialist  will  assist  the  implementing  agencies  in  maintaining  the  project \naccounts according to double-entry accrual accounting. An assessment of the financial position \nof the municipalities has found these public investments financially sustainable. \nB.  Governance \n24.  A  governance  risk  assessment  of  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and \ncorruption in the urban development sector was made when the country partnership strategy for \nNepal was prepared in 2009. The financial management risks of the municipalities are being \naddressed through capacity development technical assistance (footnote 13). ADB and other \ndevelopment partners are supporting the capacity building of relevant government agencies to \nlessen public procurement and corruption risks. Transparency, in procurement and financing as \nwell  as  other  matters,  will  be  maximized  under  the  project  to  reduce  central  and  local \ngovernment risks. \n  \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) has been explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \nC.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The Project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The improvements to be \nmade  in  drainage  and  sewerage  infrastructure  and  solid  waste  management  systems  will \nproduce significant public health benefits for the community in general, including the poor. While \ndrainage and sewerage system improvement will not cover the entire municipal areas, the poor \nliving in the peripheral areas will also benefit from the project, as community development \nprograms will be directed at women and vulnerable groups including the poor. Small-scale \nfacilities, such as communal water taps and communal toilets that will give the poor better \naccess to water supply and sanitation, will be supported. The promotion of 3R programs is also \nexpected to benefit the poor and women. These programs will be participatory, with women and \nvulnerable groups appropriately represented. A gender equality and social inclusion action plan \nwill be implemented to ensure inclusiveness in the project and address the different needs of \nwomen and vulnerable groups. \nD.  Safeguards \n27.  Environmental safeguards. The project is category B in accordance with the ADB \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies \nprepared  initial  environmental  examinations,  including  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs), for the subprojects during the feasibility study. Specific locations were identified for all \nmajor infrastructure and facilities; for some small-scale facilities, such as water supply in Butwal \nand  community  and  school  toilets,  the  locations  will  be  fixed  after  Board  approval.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework was therefore also prepared. The framework \nsets  out  the  requirements  for  project  screening  and  classification,  subproject  selection, \n ", "9 \ninformation disclosure to and consultation with the affected people, environmental assessment, \nEMP development and implementation, and monitoring and reporting. The initial environmental \nexaminations found the planned subprojects to have only small and localized adverse impact on \nthe environment, which can be mitigated with the mitigation measures proposed in the EMPs. \nOn the other hand, the improvements in drainage and sewerage systems and in solid waste \nmanagement will have significant positive impact on community hygiene and sanitation. The \nEMPs will be implemented by the PIUs and the implementation will be monitored by the PCO. \nDesign and supervision consultants will assist the PIUs in implementing the EMPs.  \n \n28.  Social safeguards. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement and category \nB for indigenous peoples in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. Several \nsubprojects  involve  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement,  but  the  involuntary \nresettlement impact is not considered significant.28 Draft resettlement plans have been prepared \nfor these subprojects in compliance with the government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policy requirements. A \nresettlement framework has also been prepared. The PCO will see to it that the PIUs update the \nresettlement plan, if needed, during detailed design and implement the final resettlement plan. \nConsidering the nature and scale of these subprojects, the impact on indigenous peoples will be \nlimited to a few involuntary resettlement and land acquisition cases. The draft resettlement plan \nincludes an indigenous peoples plan, and the resettlement framework includes an indigenous \npeoples planning framework, with special assistance measures for indigenous people and other \nvulnerable groups. As sanitation services improve, so will the health benefits for indigenous \npeople. In addition, the gender equality and social inclusion plan contains specific actions \nfavorable to indigenous people.  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The major risks, such \nas  political  instability,  the  continued  absence  of  elected  mayors,  and  frequent  transfer  of \nexecutive officers in municipalities, can be mitigated to a manageable level. The intended \nbenefits and impact of the project are therefore expected to outweigh the costs.   \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nTransition to a federal structure, the peace  Development partners will maintain close dialogue with the \nprocess, and the political instability related  government and all political parties to ensure that the development \nto these may cause frequent strikes in  and reform process is not derailed and keeps its momentum beyond \nparticular in the Terai, and may delay  the political challenges.
