The \nimproved road will become a backbone of the northeastern part of \nthe state, and connect it to National Highway 2 (NH2), the state\u2019s \nmain highway, and to the larger national highway network. \n \nThe Project will also enhance the project management skills of the \nofficials of the Road Construction Department (RCD) of the state \ngovernment  of  Jharkhand  (GOJH)  through  involvement  in \nactivities that are central to project management, such as project \ndesign, implementation planning, procurement, land acquisition, \nresettlement and rehabilitation, environmental management, utility \nshifting, contract management, and financial management. This \nwill be replicated by RCD for future road improvement projects.  \n   \nRationale  Jharkhand is one of four states in India with a poverty incidence \nabove 40%. It was created in 2000 out of the southern half of the \nstate of Bihar, and a high proportion of its population is tribal. \nSocioeconomic indicators reveal that significant improvements are \nneeded in terms of income, literacy, health, and access to basic \namenities.    \n \nJharkhand has  prominent  industrial  cities,  due  to  its  abundant \nnatural  and  mineral  resources,  but  also  has  the  highest  rural \npoverty incidence in India. Industrial activities are concentrated in \nthe area south of NH2, which connects Delhi to Kolkata and forms \npart  of  the  core  national  transport  network  called  the  \u201cgolden \nquadrilateral.\u201d The area to the north of NH2 lacks major industrial \nactivities despite its rich mineral reserves. The poor quality of the \nroad infrastructure is one factor constraining the development of \nthis part of the state. \n \n  The Project proposes to address the disparities within Jharkhand \nby providing a good transportation network in a hitherto neglected \narea, and will contribute to reducing interstate disparities in India, ", "ii   \nwhich is one of the key goals of the Government\u2019s 11th Five Year \nPlan for 2007\u20132012.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  improve  transport  connectivity  in  the  state  of \nJharkhand through improvement of a key state road section in one \nof the state\u2019s least developed but resource-rich areas. This will \ncontribute to expansion of economic opportunities and poverty \nreduction in the area that the project road serves, and in turn \nimprove  the  overall  economic  wellbeing  of  the  state.  Since \nJharkhand is one of the least-developed states (as measured by \nsocial and economic indicators), this development is expected to \ncontribute to the overall reduction of interstate disparities in India. \nThe  Project\u2019s  immediate  outcome  will  be  improved  transport \nconnectivity in the project area resulting from reduction in vehicle \noperating costs and travel time on the project road.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The  Project\u2019s  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $240.0  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of about $21 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $200,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of India will provide the loan proceeds in local \nTerms  currency to the state government of Jharkhand on the same terms \nand conditions as received from ADB. The state government will \nbear the foreign exchange risk on the loan.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The state government of Jharkhand, through RCD \n   \nImplementation  A dedicated project implementation cell (PIC) established within \nArrangements  RCD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management \nthroughout the Project implementation period. The PIC is headed \nby a director reporting to the RCD secretary, and will have enough \nstaff to handle duties related to consulting services, civil works, \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  environment,  and  financial \nmanagement  (disbursement,  accounting,  and  internal  auditing). \nThe PIC finance and accounts wing will handle project payments \nand accounting. For each civil works contract package, the PIC \nwill have a project implementation unit headed by an assistant \ndirector (at the level of assistant engineer) to interact on a daily ", "  iii\nbasis with the civil works contractor and construction supervision \nconsultant (CSC). \n \nTwo  project-related  committees  were  established  in  December \n2008: (i) a high-level project coordination committee (chaired by \nthe chief secretary of GOJH), which will facilitate preconstruction \nactivities concerning different GOJH line departments; and (ii) a \nproject monitoring committee, chaired by the secretary of RCD, to \nmonitor project implementation.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the proposed ADB loan will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding will be used for all civil works contracts.  Shopping will be \nused  for  supply  contracts  less  than  $100,000.  Advanced \ncontracting and retroactive financing will be used to facilitate rapid \nimplementation. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). RCD will hire a consulting firm as CSC, which \nwill assume the role of the \u201cEngineer\u201d for the civil works contracts. \nThe CSC will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedure with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  aims  to  redress  the  sharp  urban\u2013rural  divide  by \nBeneficiaries  improving a key state road in one of the state\u2019s underdeveloped \nareas. The improvement to the road infrastructure will contribute \nto expansion of economic activities and poverty reduction in the \narea  that  the  road  serves,  and  in  turn  improve  the  overall \neconomic wellbeing of the state. \n \n  The direct beneficiaries will be the poor living in the project area, \nwho are primarily farmers engaged in subsistence farming. The \nexpected  reduction  in  transport  time  and  cost  will  generate \nopportunities  for  farmers  to  expand  production  and  market \nagriculture produce outside their own villages. They will also have \nbetter employment opportunities outside agriculture, both through \nimproved access to economic centers and increased industrial \nactivities  in  the  project  area  resulting  from  improved  transport \nconnectivity. \n \nEnhancement of the project management skills of RCD officials \nwill benefit all road users through long-term improvements in the \ncondition of the overall state road network. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  risk  of  initial  delays  has  already  been  largely  mitigated \nthrough RCD\u2019s advance actions and support provided by ADB for \nvarious preconstruction activities. District-level task forces have \nbeen  formed  for  interdepartmental  coordination.  Training  on \nprocurement and safeguard requirements was provided to RCD ", "iv   \nstaff and staff of other concerned departments to mitigate the risk \nof  initial  delays  due  to  lack  of  coordination,  and  poor \nunderstanding of ADB requirements. \n \nThe  risks  related  to  obtaining  the  statutory  environmental  and \nforest clearance could also delay the civil works and could lead to \nincreased construction costs and delays in project completion. To \nmitigate these risks, RCD has taken advance actions to obtain the \nrequisite  clearances.  An  environmental  clearance  has  already \nbeen  obtained  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest. \nProposals for forest clearance have also been submitted to the \ndistrict  forest  offices.  The  high-level  project  coordination \ncommittee  chaired by the chief secretary is closely monitoring \nprogress on the needed clearances. \n \nProject roads were identified in accordance with the state's road \ndevelopment priorities. The Project will entail land acquisition due \nto proposed road widening and construction of bypasses to avoid \nbuilt-up  areas.  Detailed  planning  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement actions has been carried out with assistance from \nADB and its consultants, and through extended consultations with \nthe project-affected communities.   \n \nThe risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated \nby  reflecting  the  state  context  in  the  planned  institutional \nstrengthening, which takes into account both the actions already \ntaken by GOJH, and the availability of resources.  \n \nIn  Jharkhand,  the  road  maintenance  budget  allocation  almost \ntripled  from  FY2003  to  FY2007.  Actual  spending  has  also \nincreased steadily, but is still well below the allocated budget. \nSecuring maintenance funds is not an immediate concern. Parallel \ncapacity development TA is to be provided under a TA cluster for \nAdvanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction in India. \nConsequently,  the  Project  will  focus  on  improving  RCD's  road \nasset management capability for better and more efficient usage \nof allocated funds.  \n ", "84 o 00'E 87 o 00'E\nI N D I A\nJHARKHAND STATE ROADS PROJECT\nSahebganj\nB I H A R\n25 o 00'N GodBdaarhBeatrhaPrwaakur Ganga River 25 o 00'N\nAmrapara\nKodarma Deoghar\nDumka\nU T T A R Madhupur\nP R A D E S H Barhi Giridih\nChatra\nGarhwa Jamtara\nDaltonganj\nHazaribagh Govindpur\nGumia Dhanbad\nKumardhubi\nSaunda Bokaro\nRamgarh\nPatratu N\nGola\nLohardaga RANCHI W E S T\nSilli B E N G A L\n0 20 40 60 80\nKhunti\nC H H A T T I S G A R H Gumla Kilometers\nMango\nJamshedpur State Capital\nChakradharpur City/Town\nGhatshila\nSimdega Chaibasa Project Road\nChakulia\nNational Highway\nBahalda\nHat Gamaharia Other Road\nNoamundi Railway\n22 o 00'N River 22 o 00'N\nState Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nO R I S S A\n0\n9\n-0\n7\n8\n9 H 84 o 00'E 87 o 00'E\nR", " \nI.   THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Jharkhand State Roads Project.  \n \nII.   RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  India's achievement in economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years has been \nremarkable. The reforms initiated in 1991 are widely considered to have resulted in more rapid \neconomic growth. India's per capita income grew at a moderate rate of 3.8% per annum in \nFY1992\u2013FY2002, and increased more rapidly at a rate of 7.0% per annum in FY2003\u2013FY2008. \nThe poverty incidence fell from 36% in FY1993 to 27.5% in FY2004.1 However more than 300 \nmillion people still live below the poverty line. Regional imbalances and disparities in income \nand poverty persist. While the poverty incidence is less than 15% in some northwestern and \nsouthern states, in many central eastern states more than 40% of the population remains below \nthe poverty line.  \n \n3.  Jharkhand is one of four Indian states with a poverty incidence above 40%.2 It was \ncreated in 2000 from the southern half of the state of Bihar. Jharkhand\u2019s population is about \n26.9 million (26% of which is tribal), with an area of 79,714 km2. Compared to the current state \nof Bihar, Jharkhand is less-densely populated, and its population is still highly rural.3 While the \nstate\u2019s socioeconomic indicators are generally better than those of Bihar, they still lag behind \nthe average for India in terms of income, literacy, health, and access to basic amenities.   \n \n4.  On the other hand, the state is one of the richest in India in terms of natural and mineral \nresources. Forest cover is high (about 30%), and the state has extensive mineral resources, \nwith India\u2019s largest deposits of iron ore, copper ore, mica, and uranium; second-largest deposits \nof chrome; and third-largest deposits of coal and bauxite. This has produced a number of highly \nindustrialized cities, such as Jamshedpur, Bokaro, and Dhanbad.   \n \n5.  The state\u2019s recent economic development has been impressive, due to the increasing \ndemand for raw materials. Per capita income increased by 85% from the creation of Jharkhand \nin 2000 to 2006, compared with the average national increase of 54% over the same period. \nHowever, in absolute terms, the state\u2019s per capita income is still 27% below the average for \nIndia.  \n \n6.  The state is along the main transport corridor connecting New Delhi (the capital) and \nKolkata (India\u2019s third largest city). The state's industrial areas are concentrated in the central \nand eastern parts of Jharkhand, and are fairly well served by both the railway network and \nnational highways. The state's two airports (at Ranchi and Jamshedpur) also serve these areas. \nRoads are the main means of transport in the rest of the rural areas, where 78% of the state's \npopulation lives.  \n \n7.  Jharkhand\u2019s road network includes 1,844 kilometers (km) of national highways, 1,886 \nkm of state highways, 4,155 km of major district roads, and about 6,300 km of rural roads.4 \n                                                 \n1  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

Figures are as of FY2004. \nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance. 2008. Economic Survey 2007\u20132008. Delhi. \n3  When Bihar was divided, Jharkhand received 46% of the state\u2019s land but just 25% of the population. \n4  Including other district roads and village roads. ", "2   \nJharkhand has 58 km of road per 100,000 population (compared to the average for India of 257 \nkm per 100,000 population), and a road density of 18 km per 100 square km (km2), (compared \nto the average for India of 75 km per 100 km2). The state\u2019s road penetration is inadequate, with \nsome 74% of communities not connected with all-weather roads.  \n \n8.  The condition of the roads in Jharkhand is very poor. In 2002, 60% of the state's national \nhighways and state highways were in bad condition, with half of them barely drivable. The \nsituation  has  improved  little  in  the  last  6  years,  and  can  be  attributed  to  longstanding \nunderinvestment in road construction and maintenance; this has contributed to the poor state of \nroad infrastructure in many other Indian states as well.    \n \n9.  Three organizations are involved in the management of road infrastructure in Jharkhand. \nThe National Highways Authority of India is entrusted to maintain and improve, under the \nNational Highway Development Program, key sections of national highways including a 190 km \nstretch of National Highway 2 (NH2) forming part of the Delhi\u2013Kolkata link of the \u201cGolden \nQuadrilateral.\u201d Other national highways, state highways, and district roads (totaling about 6,900 \nkm) are the responsibility of the Road Construction Department (RCD) of the state government \nof  Jharkhand  (GOJH).  Other  district  roads  and  village  roads  are  under  the  Rural  Works \nDepartment, which executes the rural roads improvement scheme under the Pradhan Mantri \nGram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).5  \n \n10.  RCD is the nodal department in the state for overall development of road infrastructure. \nRecognizing the importance of road infrastructure for the state's economic development and \nreduction of poverty, GOJH has steadily increased the budgetary allocation to RCD from $65 \nmillion  in  FY2003  to  $187  million  in  FY2008.  The  share  of  the  budget  allocated  to  road \nmaintenance ranged from 10% to 15% of the overall budget during this period. Budget utilization \nfor capital investment improved significantly in FY2008, but has been stagnant for maintenance, \nat around 85%. Considering the relatively small size of its road network and the lean structure of \nRCD, the constraints on road maintenance appear to be related to RCD\u2019s institutional capacity \nto utilize allocated funds efficiently, rather than the size of the budget allocation. \n \n11.  The Project will be the first major road infrastructure development since the creation of \nJharkhand in 2000.  A design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Main Sector Issues  \n \na.  In-State Disparities \n \n12.  Jharkhand has a few prominent industrial centers, dense forest that covers 30% of the \nland area, and mostly unirrigated agricultural land. The incidence of urban poverty is 23%, \nwhich is much lower than neighboring Bihar and Orissa, but the rural poverty incidence is 49% \n(the highest in India), pointing to a sharp urban\u2013rural divide.  \n \n13.  Industrial activities in Jharkhand are concentrated in the area south of NH2, which links \nDelhi to Kolkata. The area northeast of NH2 (called Santhal Parganas) lacks major industrial \nactivities despite its rich mineral reserves. It is heavily forested, and its rural population is mainly \nengaged in subsistence farming. There are no major national highways or high-standard state \nhighways connecting Santhal Parganas to NH2, to the state capital (Ranchi) or to outside \n                                                 \n5 Meaning \"Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program.\"  ", "  3\neconomic centers. Rail service in this area is also marginal. Poor transport has been a factor \nconstraining the development of this part of the state. Jharkhand needs to significantly improve \nits road network to reduce intrastate disparities and accelerate the pace of economic growth and \npoverty reduction. \n \nb.  Institutional Capacity \n \n14.  Jharkhand\u2019s RCD is a new organization created out of the old (pre-Jharkhand) Bihar \nRCD. The road network in Jharkhand comprises about one-third (in terms of length) of the \nnational and state highways and major district roads in the former undivided state of Bihar, but \nthe allocation of RCD staff to Jharkhand was not proportional. With the exception of executive \nengineers for works implementation, Jharkhand\u2019s RCD has far fewer engineers of all types.6 \nThe staff shortage is particularly acute at RCD headquarters, where planning and management \ntakes place. \n  \n15.  The lean structure and recent formation of Jharkhand\u2019s RCD has some limited but \nimportant positive impacts. RCD\u2019s staff outsources all works\u2014including maintenance works\u2014to \ncivil works contractors. Supervision consultants are used for larger contracts. RCD has been \nfreed of the financial burden and inefficiency of engaging laborers directly to carry out works on \nits own. Staff costs, which equaled 20.2% of RCD expenditures in FY2008, are declining, and \ndo not place a major burden on the budget.  \n \n16.  Some mid-level RCD  staff have experience in externally funded projects from their \ninvolvement in the World Bank-financed Bihar Plateau Development Project in the 1990s. This \nexperience has facilitated the project team's policy dialogue with GOJH. Overall Jharkhand\u2019s \nRCD is more receptive to new ideas and the adoption of international best practices than its \nolder, better-staffed peer organizations in other states.     \n \n  2.  Strategies of the Central Government and GOJH \n \n17.  Addressing regional disparities is a pillar of the Government of India\u2019s 11th Five Year \nPlan (FYP) for 2007\u20132012.7 Poor infrastructure is widely recognized as one of the biggest \nconstraints to poverty reduction. The 11th FYP maintains the same emphasis on development \nof infrastructure and continues the national programs initiated in 10th FYP, such as the National \nHighway Development Program and Bharat Nirman,8 while introducing various fiscal incentives \nand directly targeted programs to remove infrastructure bottlenecks. \n \n18.  State roads in India are the responsibility of the state governments, and the Government \nhas  historically  limited  its  involvement  to  transferring  financial  resources  to  the  state \ngovernments  for  general  road  maintenance  and  removal  of  specific  bottlenecks,  such  as \nbridges. However, these transfers have been insufficient, and additional problems have arisen \nincluding (i) financial resources thinly spread for too many projects; (ii) delays in preconstruction \nactivities; (iii) weak management by contractors; and (iv) poor implementation capacity, as \nacknowledged by the Government in its 11th FYP. The result is the generally poor condition of \nstate highways found throughout India.  \n                                                 \n6  For example, Jharkhand RCD has only three chief engineers and 11 superintending engineers. Bihar RCD has \nseven chief engineers and 28 superintending engineers. Jharkhand RCD has only seven executive engineers for \nsurvey, planning and design, whereas Bihar RCD has 21 for these functions.    \n7  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008. Eleventh Five Year Plan 2007-2012. New Delhi. \n8  Bharat Nirman (meaning \"build India\") is a comprehensive rural infrastructure development scheme begun in 2005 \nthat consists of six components, including irrigation, rural housing, rural drinking water, rural electrification, rural \ntelecommunication, and rural roads. ", "4   \n19.  To assist with state roads, direct intervention has been sought from external financing \ninstitutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. Since 2001 ADB \nhas extended assistance for state roads to Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, \nand West Bengal states. Jharkhand will be the sixth state to receive ADB assistance for its state \nroads.  \n \n20.  GOJH has initiated several reforms, based on lessons from other states in India that \nhave received external assistance. The Jharkhand Highway Act was enacted in 2006 to provide \na legal framework for overall highway corridor management by GOJH and future establishment \nof a highway authority. Rules under the act came into force in 2007. RCD has drafted its own \nPublic Works Department (PWD) code to replace the Bihar PWD code that is currently in use. \nRCD also entered into a project development agreement with Infrastructure Leasing & Financial \nServices to identify highway schemes and projects that could be undertaken under public\u2013\nprivate partnership options. A special-purpose vehicle has been formed for this purpose. GOJH \nhas been proactive in creating an enabling environment for private sector participation. \n \n  3.  External Assistance and ADB Strategy \n \n21.  Substantial external assistance has been provided to India for roads. ADB has provided \nabout $3.7 billion in loans and technical assistance (TA), and the World Bank has provided \nloans and grants totaling $5.6 billion for upgrading national highways, improving state highways, \nand upgrading rural roads. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) (currently \nknown as Japan International Cooperation Agency [JICA]) has provided five loans for a total of \n$0.33  billion  to  upgrade  national  highways  and  construct  bridges.  The  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom has provided TA to support the sector, \nincluding financing for project preparatory TA (PPTA) for the Project.9 A TA for institutional \nstrengthening is being processed as part of a TA cluster\u2014also to be financed by DFID\u2014for \npoverty reduction in India. ADB support has been developed in close collaboration with these \nkey development partners\u2014ADB  and DFID  hold regular coordination meetings, and active \ncoordination has been undertaken with the World Bank. Mini-retreats for transport operations in \nSouth Asia have become a regular practice for ADB headquarters staff, while a broad-based \nsector collaboration mechanism has been instituted to facilitate the exchange of information \nbetween key sector coordinators of the resident missions of both ADB and the World Bank. \nCooperation with the Government of Japan has also been active, particularly for the railway and \nurban subsectors.  \n \n22.  Since 2001, ADB has provided six loans to improve India\u2019s state road network (to West \nBengal in 2001,10 Madhya Pradesh in 200211 and 2007,12 Chhattisgarh in 2003,13 Uttarakhand \n                                                 \n9  Project preparatory technical assistance for State Roads Projects in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, processed in \n2007 as a component technical assistance under ADB. 2006.

Typically,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  this  subsector  comprises \ncapacity development to enhance the project and asset management capacity of the executing \nagency (EA), along with financial assistance for physical investment to improve the state road \nnetwork. ADB facilitates experience sharing by holding workshops during project preparation \nutilizing TA resources. The tripartite portfolio review meetings\u2014in which representatives of the \nEAs from ADB-assisted states gather and review the progress of their respective projects and \ndiscuss sector issues\u2014have been an important forum for cross-learning.16  \n \n23.  An ongoing World Bank-financed rural roads project in Jharkhand is supporting PMGSY \nto  improve  road  connectivity  in  rural  areas.17  The  Jharkhand  State  Roads  Project  will \ncomplement the World Bank rural roads project by addressing intrastate disparities, and will \nalso contribute to reducing interstate disparities in India, which is a key goal of the 11th FYP. \nThe latest country partnership strategy has been developed to support the goals of the 11th \nFYP. The Project is relevant to achieving the result of the country partnership strategy. An \nanalysis of India's state road subsector is in Appendix 2. A summary of external assistance to \nthe roads sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n  4.  Lessons \n \n24.  Key recommendations of ADB\u2019s 2007 sector assistance program evaluation (SAPE) \ninclude the following: (i) work closely with the EA to identify and resolve problems that lead to \nimplementation delay; (ii) give equal emphasis to good portfolio management and the volume of \nloan approvals; and (iii) take into account local variations in implementation capabilities and \nmake  better  use  of  past  experience  to  improve  the  design  of  future  projects.18  These \nrecommendations were fully considered in designing and implementing PPTA for the Project. A \nsimple project design based on a project lending modality to focus on proper execution of core \nRCD functions has been adopted, in consideration of RCD's relatively low staffing level and \nlimited exposure to externally assisted projects. Detailed action plans have been drawn up for \npreconstruction activities, and form the basis for ongoing support in safeguard, procurement, \nand financial management by ADB consultants and missions. A unit has been created within \nRCD for project formulation and implementation, and key positions have been filled by officials \nwho have undergone ADB training on project management. ADB will provide TA to continue \nproject management support and assist RCD in strengthening its core technical functions. \n  \n25.  The 2007 SAPE also recommends further support for private sector participation. The \nimplementation of public\u2013private partnership projects has faced roadblocks in Jharkhand as a \nresult of a lack of investor interest.19 This was considered in developing the Project's financing \nand execution modality. The Project will be the first major infrastructure development project \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2006.

To attract \ninvestors to the highway portions, the National Highways Authority of India has recast these build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \nprojects on an annuity basis, in which contractors that are awarded projects would be paid a guaranteed amount in \ninstallments, thus eliminating the risk of investors recovering their investment through tolls. ", "6   \ninvolving external financiers and following international competitive bidding procedures, which \nare  themselves  new  challenges  for  the  state.  The  Project  will  showcase  the  adoption  of \ninternational best practices in a local context, and aim to instill confidence in the private sector in \nentering into a longer-term partnership that is not limited to project\u2019s design and construction \nphases.  \n \n26.  The 2007 SAPE further recommends that policy dialogue be strengthened regarding \nroad safety, sector governance and corruption, and achieving socially inclusive objectives. Road \nsafety has been addressed by adopting a wider right-of-way that provides adequate space \noutside the roadway for pedestrians and nonmotorized traffic. The detailed design was reviewed \nfrom a road safety viewpoint and changes made to improve road geometry. A full-fledged \nfinance  and  accounting  unit  for  project  implementation,  staffed  with  qualified  officials  and \nequipped  with  internal  audit  mechanisms,  has  been  largely  established,  with  rules  and \nprocedures for the unit already in place. The selection of the project location is in itself an \nexpression of GOJH's focus on socially inclusive development. In the course of social analysis \nand resettlement plan preparation, project communities were consulted on the project design \nthrough intensive stakeholder consultation.20  \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n27.  The  Project  will  improve  transport  connectivity  in  the  state  of  Jharkhand  through \nimprovement of a key state road section in one of the state\u2019s least developed but resource-rich \nareas. This will contribute to expansion of economic opportunities and poverty reduction in the \narea  that  the  project  road  serves,  and  in  turn  lead  to  balanced  development  and  overall \neconomic well-being of the state. Since Jharkhand is one of the least-developed states in terms \nof social and economic indicators, this development is expected to contribute to the overall \nreduction of interstate disparities in India. \n \n28.  The Project\u2019s immediate outcome will be improved transport connectivity in the project \narea resulting from reduction in vehicle operating costs and travel time on the project road.       \n \nB.  Outputs \n29.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  improve  a  311  km  state  road  from  Govindpur  to \nSahebganj (via Jamtara, Dumka, and Barhet) to a two-lane standard. The improved road will \nbecome a backbone of the northeastern part of the state, and connect this part to NH2, and to \nthe larger national highway network. A description of the project roads and a summary of design \nstandards are in Appendix 4. \n \n30.  The Project will also enhance project management skills of the officials of RCD through \ninvolvement under the Project in activities that are central to project implementation, such as \nproject  design,  implementation  planning,  procurement,  land  acquisition,  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation, environmental management, utility shifting, contract management, and financial \nmanagement.  Systems  to  enhance  project  management  skills\u2014such  as  a  management \ninformation system and a quality assurance system\u2014will be developed as part of this exercise. \nThis approach will be replicated by RCD for future road improvement projects.  \n                                                 \n20  During the course of social assessment, 14 focus group discussions were organized. Resettlement plans based on \na complete (100% coverage) census of affected persons are already in place. Preparation of the plans involved 17 \nblock-level meetings. ", "  7\nC.   Special Features \n \n31.  This is the first ADB intervention in the transport sector in Jharkhand, which is a newly-\ncreated state. Jharkhand\u2019s RCD has had no experience with externally financed projects since \nseparating from Bihar\u2019s RCD. A simple design has therefore been adopted for the Project, which \nwill allow RCD to concentrate on its core mandate: improving and maintaining the assets it is \nresponsible  for  in  a  good  state.  The  Project  will  adopt  international  best  practices  in \nprocurement  and  contract  management,  e.g.,  international  competitive  bidding,  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \nInternationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils (FIDIC)-based contracts, and outsourcing of construction \nsupervision.  It  is  expected  that  these  arrangements  will  facilitate  participation  of  qualified \ncontractors.  Contracts  will  be  provided  in  large  packages  to  experienced  and  qualified \ncontractors who will transfer the necessary technical and managerial skills to local contractors \nthrough  association-type  subcontracts.  RCD  officials  will  be  exposed  to  international  best \npractices in project management through the use of a computerized financial management \nsystem and a management information system, which will be linked to a quality assurance \nsystem to be established by the construction supervision consultant (CSC). \n  \n32.  ADB will continue its assistance to RCD in preconstruction activities under a newly \napproved TA for Capacity Development to Enhance Project Readiness and Results Monitoring \nfor Transport Projects, financed by the Government of Japan.21 Assistance will be provided for \nprocurement, social safeguard, and environmental impact management.  \n  \n33.  To further strengthen its project management capacity, a capacity development TA for \ninstitutional strengthening of Jharkhand road sector has been developed in the amount of \n$750,000, which is included in a TA cluster for Advanced Project Preparedness for Poverty \nReduction in India, financed by the Government of the United Kingdom.22 Consultants to be \nengaged under the TA will assist the RCD in (i) improving its business procedure for project \nmanagement and asset management; (ii) adopting best practices and tools for project planning, \ndesign, road asset management, and road safety; and (iii) enhancing its staff's skills through \ndedicated, structured training on these issues.  \n \n34.  The scope of the TA may also include assistance in (i) establishing Jharkhand\u2019s state \nengineering academy, (ii) strengthening RCD\u2019s central design office, and (iii) establishing a \ncentral testing laboratory. Advisory assistance will be provided under the grant-financed TA, \nwhile necessary equipment and facilities will be financed out of ADB loan proceeds.  \n \nD.   Project Investment Plan \n \n35.  The project investment cost is estimated at $240.0 million, including taxes and duties of \nabout $21 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest and \nother charges during implementation (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are \nin Appendix 5. \n \n36.  ADB will finance the local taxes and duties, estimated at $21 million. On average, taxes \nand duties, which amount to 9%\u201313% of project costs for construction of state highways in India, \nare considered reasonable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory. \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2009.

Financing Plan \n \n37.  The Government has requested a loan of $200,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n38.  The Government will provide the loan proceeds in local currency to GOJH on the same \nterms and conditions as received from ADB. GOJH will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloan.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n39.  Jharkhand\u2019s RCD will be the EA for the Project.  A dedicated project implementation cell \n(PIC)23 established within RCD will be responsible for overall project management throughout \nthe Project implementation period. The PIC is headed by a director reporting to the RCD \nsecretary, and will have enough staff to handle duties related to consulting services, civil works, \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  environment,  and  financial  management  (disbursement, \naccounting,  and  internal  auditing).  The  PIC  finance  and  accounts  wing  will  handle  project \npayments and accounting. For each civil works contract package, the PIC will have a project \nimplementation unit headed by an assistant director (at the level of assistant engineer) to \ninteract on a daily basis with the civil works contractor and CSC.  \n \n40.  Two project-related committees were established in December 2008: (i) a high-level \nproject  coordination  committee,  chaired  by  the  GOJH  chief  secretary,  to  facilitate \npreconstruction  activities  concerning  different  GOJH  line  departments;  and  (ii)  a  project \nmonitoring committee, chaired by the RCD secretary, to monitor project implementation. The \norganizational structure for project implementation is in Appendix 6.  \n \n41.  Task forces were formed in October 2007, at the start of the PPTA, in each of the five \ndistricts along the project road to coordinate project formulation and preconstruction activities \namong different district-level functionaries. Each of the task forces is chaired by the deputy \ncommissioner and includes district-level representatives from the forest, land, and program \ndepartments. The executive engineer of RCD serves as secretary of the task forces. The task \nforces have served as effective vehicles to facilitate project formulation, and will remain in place \nduring project implementation. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n42.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, inclusive of preconstruction activities in \n2009, and a defects notification period of 1 year. The construction part of the civil works contract \nwill be for 36 months (June 2010 to May 2013), followed by a 1-year defects notification period. \nThe CSC will be engaged 2 months prior to commencement of civil works to assist RCD in \npreparatory activities, and continue to be engaged until the expiry of the 12-month defects \nnotification period in May 2014. An indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n  \n3.  Procurement \n43.  All procurement to be financed under the proposed ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nInternational competitive bidding will be used for all civil works contracts. Shopping will be used \nfor goods with supply contracts estimated at less than $100,000. Advance contracting and \nretroactive financing will be used to facilitate rapid implementation. A procurement plan is in \nAppendix 8. \n \n4.   Consulting Services \n44.  Consultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). RCD will select and engage a \n                                                 \n23 The PIC was established in March 2008.  ", "10  \nconsulting firm as CSC, which will assume the role of the \u201cengineer\u201d for the civil works contracts. \nThe CSC will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection procedure with a quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20.  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n45.  ADB approved advance contracting of civil works in July 2008. An EA procurement \ncapacity assessment was carried out during loan processing with positive findings on both \norganizational and procedural aspects (Supplementary Appendix C). It is expected that RCD\u2019s \nprocurement  activities  for  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  will  progress  to  an \nadvanced stage in which contracts may be ready to be awarded before loan effectiveness. \nBased on this, the Government and GOJH requested that the scope of advance contracting be \nenlarged to cover procurement of equipment and retroactive financing for works, equipment and \nconsulting services. Up to 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred on works, equipment, and consulting services for the \nProject (i) prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months prior to signing of the loan \nagreement; and (ii) in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines, Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, and safeguard policies. The Government and GOJH have been informed that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n46.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  GOJH.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47.  GOJH  will  also  (i)  establish  a  separate  finance  and  accounts  wing  within  the  PIC; \n(ii) introduce a financial management system prior to commencement of project implementation, \nfor which a firm of consultants has been appointed under GOJH financing; (iii) engage an \ninternal auditor to be placed in PIC for verification of records and reports; (iv) post signboards at \nthe worksites furnishing relevant contract details; and (v) provide information on procurement \nand progress of project implementation on its website. In addition, GOJH will assign a senior \nfinance and accounts officer from its accountant general's office to the PIC to ensure proper \nrecording of financial matters. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Reimbursement procedures will be used for civil works, \nconsulting services, and equipment. The statement of expenditures procedure will be used to \nreimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per individual payment. \n ", " 11\n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  RCD will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, expenditures incurred, and the use of local funds \nunder the project components. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples.  Independent  auditors,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  audit  the  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements annually. The Government will submit consolidated annual audited reports \nand related financial statements to ADB within 6 months from the end of the previous fiscal \nyear. The annual audit report will include an audit of the statement of expenditure procedures \nand will include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds and compliance with \nstatement of expenditure procedures. \n \n50.  RCD will prepare and provide ADB with quarterly project progress reports, including any \nchanges to the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered and remedial \nactions taken, anticipated problems and the proposed remedial measures, and work to be \nundertaken in the following period. RCD will submit the quarterly progress reports to ADB within \n45 days from the close of each quarter. These reports will include a summary financial account \nfor each contract, expenditures to date, reports on performance monitoring, and results of \nmonitoring of social and environmental impacts. \n \n51.  RCD will prepare and provide ADB with a project completion report within 3 months of \ncompletion of transactions under the Project. This report will provide a detailed evaluation of the \ndesign,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact, \neconomic rate of return, and other details relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n52.  A project performance monitoring system for the Project has been developed under the \nPPTA in consultation with the RCD. Baseline data have also been collected under the PPTA, as \npart of social assessment and traffic survey for economic analysis. The system will be further \nrefined during the inception stage of the Project with the assistance of the CSC. \n \n10.  Project Review \n53.  ADB and RCD will meet regularly as required to discuss the progress of the Project and \nany changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures required to achieve the \nproject  objectives.  They  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  focusing  on  issues  related  to \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  agree  on  changes,  if  needed,  to  achieve  the  project \nobjectives. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Economic and Financial Justification \n \n54.  The approach used to evaluate the Project follows the standard practice of comparing \ninvestment costs and road user costs with and without the Project, using net present value with \na 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criterion. The \nHighway  Development  and  Management  Model  (HDM-4)  was  used  for  the  analysis.  The \nanalysis focuses on savings in direct transport costs in terms of vehicle operating costs and \nvalue of passenger time. Value added from better transport links resulting in new industries and \nemployment are not quantified in this analysis but are partially captured through benefits to ", "12  \ngenerated traffic. Other benefits such as flood mitigation, crop spoilage savings and safety are \nalso not quantified, so the results presented here can be considered conservative. \n \n55.  The proposed improvements of the project road are economically viable yielding an \noverall EIRR of 21%. Among the four contract packages, three have EIRRs above 20% and one \nhas an EIRR of 17.6%. The Project is very robust with a high economic rate of return and \nsatisfies the economic efficiency criterion. \n \n56.  The sensitivity of the EIRR for the project road was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined: \n(i) construction costs increase by 15%; (ii) no time savings; (iii) benefits decrease by 15%; and \n(iv) costs increase by 15%, and benefits decrease by 15%. The results show that the quantified \neconomic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests and all road sections have an EIRR of \nmore than 12% in all sensitivity tests. In the worst case scenario, the EIRR for the Project as a \nwhole is 17% and the lowest EIRR of any individual contract package is 14%. More details of \nthe economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n57.  As the Project is non-revenue-generating, the FIRR was not calculated.  \n \nB.  Social Aspects \n \n58.  Poverty Reduction and Social Impact. According to the National Human Development \nReport 2001, 24 the state of Jharkhand, along with the neighboring states of Bihar, Orissa, and \nUttar Pradesh, consistently ranks among the poorest performers in terms of nearly all of 21 \nindicators (including demographic, health care, education, unemployment, poverty, and social \ndeprivation indicators). Although Jharkhand has many natural resources (e.g., coal, iron, and \nforests), 80% of the population is engaged in a combination of low-skilled occupations such as \nsubsistence agriculture, nonagricultural labor and small business or petty trade. Due to the \nsmall size of average landholdings (0.4\u20130.8 hectares), having more than one livelihood is \nnecessary to supplement the basic income and subsistence harvests generated through rain-\nfed agriculture.  \n59.  Jharkhand lags behind most other Indian states in terms of road connectivity, resulting in \nhigh transportation costs and long travel times to traverse even short distances within the \nstate.25 A poverty and social assessment was undertaken during project preparation. The \nassessment indicated that by rehabilitating the proposed Govindpur\u2013Sahebganj road, travel \ntime will be reduced by as much as half. Reduced travel times and costs will mean better \naccess for local communities to markets and social services such as education and health. \nThese improvements will lead to increased human, physical, financial, and social capital within \nthe  project  districts,  thereby  helping  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  inclusive  growth.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy report is in Appendix 9.  \n60.  Gender. In Jharkhand, the gender ratio of the population is 941 females for every 1,000 \nmales (2001 census). The literacy rate for females (38.9%) is low in comparison to the national \nlevel (53.7%, in the 2001 census). A gender analysis was undertaken during the social study to \nassess the impact of the Project. Six focus group discussions were undertaken with women \nbelonging to different socioeconomic groups, such as the scheduled tribes and the scheduled \ncastes.  The  discussions  revealed  that  women  in  the  project  area  are  engaged  mainly  in \n                                                 \n24  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2001.

", " 13\nhousehold chores and farming. At the primary level, the enrollment ratio of male and female \nstudents is about equal, but as the school level increases female enrollment begins to decrease. \nThe dropout rate for girls is especially high after middle school due to (i) lack of higher education \nopportunities within the villages they inhabit, and (ii) difficulties involved in traveling back and \nforth to such schools located outside the villages. Access to health facilities is also nearly \nimpossible for many women at night and during the rainy season, jeopardizing the lives of both \nmother and child in emergencies during childbirth. Women at the focus group discussions said \nthat the Project would considerably improve their access to higher education, better health care \nservices outside their villages, and markets, and would provide access to better employment \nopportunities for both women and men.   \n61.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Project was developed with a view to minimizing the \nneed for land acquisition. A census survey based on the detailed design was undertaken from \nJanuary to August 2008 to assess the resettlement impacts. On average, the existing road will \nbe widened to 30\u201345 meters, and a total of 150 hectares of private land needs to be acquired. \nThe census identified a total of 4,515 households whose assets will be impacted, including \n4,143 agricultural plots, 1,489 residential structures and 680 commercial or commercial-cum-\nresidential structures. In 93% of all cases involving land, these impacts will affect less than 10% \nof the area of the plot. In terms of structures, 56% of impacts will affect only boundary walls, \ngates and gardens with little or no impacts on the main structures.  \n62.  Four resettlement plans were prepared in accordance with the Government's National \nRehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy  2007,  Land  Acquisition  Act  (1894),  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) to address the losses of people affected by the Project. \nDetails of compensation rates for the loss of land and structures at replacement cost, shifting \nassistance,  transitional  assistance,  and  income  restoration  assistance  are  provided  in  the \nentitlement matrix of the resettlement plans. Additional support provisions for affected people \nbelonging to vulnerable groups are also included in the resettlement plans. The total cost for \nresettlement is estimated at $16.2 million. A summary of the resettlement plans is in Appendix \n10.   \n63.  Indigenous  People. The project road runs through a part of Jharkhand known as \nSanthal Parganas. All six project-affected districts have Santhal populations. The Santhals are \none of the largest tribal communities in India and are distributed widely throughout the states of \nWest  Bengal,  Bihar,  Jharkhand,  Assam,  and  Orissa.  Taking  into  account  the  significant \npresence of scheduled tribes in the project area, detailed social assessments were undertaken \nto study the potentially different impacts of the Project on tribal and nontribal households. The \nresults clearly showed that tribal households in the project area have similar socioeconomic \ncharacteristics to the overall population and are largely assimilated into the local communities. It \nis not expected that the Project will have any differential impacts on tribal population. However, \nspecific provisions have been incorporated in the entitlement matrix of the resettlement plans to \nmitigate project impacts on tribal households. \n64.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking. The state of Jharkhand has been categorized as a \n\u201clow prevalence state,\u201d with 258 officially reported cases of HIV/AIDS infection as of August \n2006.26 Similarly, interactions with stakeholders at the district and block levels revealed that no \ncases of either HIV/AIDS or human trafficking were reported during the course of the social \nassessments. Awareness campaigns and programs are organized in villages on a monthly \nbasis. However, RCD will ensure that all civil works contractors disseminate information at \nworksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those employed during \n                                                 \n26 National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 2007. HIV Fact Sheets. Delhi.  ", "14  \nconstruction. All civil works contracts will include specific clauses on these undertakings, and \nRCD, with support from the CSC, will strictly monitor compliance during project implementation. \nC.  Environmental Aspects  \n \n65.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The Project is also classified as a category B \nproject  in  accordance  with  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  environmental  impact  assessment \nrequirements.  However,  expansion  of  the  carriageway  requires  some  forest  land  to  be \nconverted as part of the right of way. The Forest Act requires that forest clearance be obtained \nfrom the regional office of the Ministry of Environment and Forest. An assistant director has \nbeen added to the PIC to deal with the environmental aspects of the Project, which include \nobtaining the forest clearance, implementing any conditions attached to forest clearance, as well \nas implementing the overall environmental management plan, and conducting environmental \nmonitoring.   \n \n66.  Based on the project categorization, an environmental assessment study was carried out \nunder the PPTA. The findings of the environmental assessment study, which are presented in \nthe initial environmental examination (IEE) report, indicate that the Project is not expected to \npresent any major environmental and ecological concerns. Most impacts will be temporary, and \noccur  during  construction.  The  main  causes  are  land  clearing  for  widening  the  roadway, \nearthwork involving cut and fill, and quarrying and transportation of construction materials to \nsupport construction activities. After the opening of the improved roads, direct local impacts will \nbe mostly related to road accidents. The IEE report details mitigation measures to minimize \nthese  adverse  impacts  presented  in  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to  guide \nimplementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  by  civil  works  contractors,  CSC,  and  RCD.  To \nensure strict implementation of the EMP by the civil works contractors, the EMP will be included \nin  the  bidding  document.  The  PIC,  assisted  by  the  CSC,  will  supervise  and  monitor \nimplementation by the contractor of the mitigation measures stated in the EMP. In addition, the \nPIC, in close coordination with relevant state agencies (such as the Forest Department and \nJharkhand Pollution Control Board) will be responsible for carrying out environmental monitoring \nand preparing an environmental monitoring report on behalf of RCD. A summary IEE report is in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \nD.  Risks  \n \n67.  The SAPE identified issues relating to state road projects in India, including (i) initial \nimplementation  delays,  (ii)  risk  of  incomplete  network  development  resulting  from  avoiding \nareas  that  require  involuntary  resettlement  and  are  environmentally  sensitive,  (iii) \nappropriateness of the sector development framework, and (iv) a need for government discipline \nto efficiently and effectively secure the maintenance budget.  \n \n68.  The risk of initial delays has already been largely mitigated through RCD\u2019s advance \nactions and support provided by ADB under the PPTA (footnote 9) and the newly approved \ncapacity development TA (footnote 21) for various preconstruction activities. District-level task \nforces  have  been  formed  for  interdepartmental  coordination.  Training  on  procurement  and \nsafeguard requirements was provided to RCD staff and staff of other concerned departments to \nmitigate the risk of initial delays due to lack of coordination, and poor understanding of ADB \nrequirements. \n \n69.  The risks related to obtaining the statutory environmental and forest clearance could \nalso delay the civil works and could lead to increased construction costs and delays in project ", " 15\ncompletion. To mitigate these risks, RCD has taken advance actions to obtain the requisite \nclearances.  An  environmental  clearance  has  already  been  obtained  from  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment and Forest. Proposals for forest clearance have also been submitted to the district \nforest offices. The high-level project coordination committee chaired by the chief secretary is \nclosely monitoring progress on the needed clearances. \n \n70.  Project roads were identified in accordance with the state's road development priorities. \nThe Project will entail land acquisition due to proposed road widening and construction of \nbypasses to avoid built-up areas. Detailed planning of land acquisition and resettlement actions \nhas been carried out with assistance from ADB and its consultants, and through extended \nconsultations with the project-affected communities.   \n \n71.  The risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated by reflecting the state \ncontext in the planned institutional strengthening, which takes into account both the actions \nalready taken by GOJH, and the availability of resources.  \n \n72.  In Jharkhand, the road maintenance budget allocation almost tripled from FY2003 to \nFY2008.  Actual  spending  has  also  increased  steadily,  but  is  still  well  below  the  allocated \nbudget.  Securing  maintenance  funds  is  not  an  immediate  concern.  Parallel  capacity \ndevelopment TA is to be provided under the TA cluster for Advanced Project Preparedness for \nPoverty Reduction in India. Consequently, the Project will focus on improving RCD's road asset \nmanagement capability for better and more efficient usage of allocated funds (footnote 22).  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n73.  In addition to the standard assurances, the governments of India and Jharkhand have \ngiven the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n74.  Implementation.

GOJH will cause RCD to report to ADB any change in the alignment of any project road, \nso as to determine if additional environmental assessment study is necessary. \n \n83.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Government through GOJH will cause RCD to ensure \nthat \n(i)  the Project is implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  the  Government's \nrelevant laws and policies, and the resettlement plans; \n(ii)  all affected people are given adequate opportunity to participate in resettlement \nplanning and implementation;  \n(iii)  the  resettlement  plans  are  disclosed  to  the  affected  people,  who  are \ncompensated and assisted prior to displacement from their houses, land, and ", " 17\nassets; and before commencement of civil works in the relevant section of the \nproject road;  \n(iv)  affected people receive priority for wage employment in project construction; \n(v)  additional assistance is provided for vulnerable groups;  \n(vi)  resettlement  plans  are  updated,  if  necessary,  in  the  course  of  project \nimplementation,  disclosed  to  the  affected  people,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval and disclosure on its website;  \n(vii)  implementation of the resettlement plans is monitored by the PIC, which shall \nreport the results quarterly to ADB; and  \n(viii)  affected people have an opportunity to express grievance at appropriate levels, \nand local officials are instructed to resolve disputes and implement measures \npromptly. \n84.  Execution of Civil Works. The Government through GOJH will  ensure that (i) subject \nto compliance with the requirements of the related resettlement plans and IEE/EMP, and the \napplicable laws and regulations of the Government and GOJH, RCD will make available land \nand  rights  in  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances,  and  clear  the  utilities,  trees,  and  any \nobstruction on such land, in a timely manner, as required for commencement of construction \nactivities relating to each road or section of a road in the works contract; and (ii) subsequent to \naward of a contract package to a contractor, roads or sections of roads in that package are not \nhanded over to the contractor unless all applicable provisions of the related resettlement plans \nand IEE/EMP are satisfied. \n \nVI.

Road Sector Overview \n \n1.  The Road Network \n1.  India\u2019s  road  network  mainly  consists  of  three categories of  roads:  (i)  about  60,000 \nkilometers (km) of national highways, (ii) a secondary system comprising about 600,000 km of \nstate highways and major district roads, and (iii) a tertiary system consisting of 2.7 million km of \nmainly rural roads. The total road length is estimated to be about 3.4 million km. The national \nhighways are high-density interstate linkages, which comprise just 2% of the network but carry \nabout  40%  of  the  traffic.  State  highways  link  national  highways  with  district  headquarters, \nimportant towns, and minor ports, while major district roads run within districts, connecting areas \nof production with markets, and rural areas to district headquarters, and state and national \nhighways. The secondary system comprises about 18% of the network and carries about 40% \nof the traffic. Rural roads link rural communities with the highway network, providing access to \nhigher agricultural incomes, employment opportunities, and social services. They represent \nabout 80% of the network and carry about 20% of traffic. \n \n2.  Sustained underinvestment in road infrastructure in India has affected all levels of the \nroad network.1 National highways and the secondary system have proven inadequate to meet \nthe rapid growth in traffic. In the last decade, road-based freight traffic increased at about 12% \nper year and passenger traffic at about 8% annually, leading to congestion, road deterioration, \nand high transport costs. Widespread overloading of freight vehicles damages the road surface, \nwhile mixed use of the roadway by both motorized and nonmotorized vehicles (bicycles, animal-\ndrawn vehicles, etc.) causes congestion and high levels of traffic accidents. Rural areas are \nhome to 70% of India\u2019s population, and many villages continue to rely on (i) earthen tracks that \nare unsuitable for motorized traffic and become impassable during the rainy season due to the \npoorly  finished  road  surface;  (ii)  missing  bridges;  and  (iii)  an  inadequate,  defective,  or \nnonexistent drainage structure. Even where all-weather connections have been provided, the \nstandard of rural roads is low, maintenance is poor, and many roads are in need of rehabilitation. \n \n2.  Government Strategy and Asian Development Bank Involvement \n3.  Two major national initiatives for road infrastructure development were initiated at the \nturn of the century. The National Highway Development Program (NHDP) was launched in 1998 \nfor the upgrading and widening of the national highway network. For rural roads, Pradhan Mantri \nGram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)2 was initiated in 2000 as a centrally-financed scheme. This was \nlater subsumed within Bharat Nirman.3 To meet the funding requirements, the Government \nestablished the Central Road Fund under the Central Road Fund Act in 2000 as a mechanism \nfor using fuel tax proceeds exclusively for road development in the country.4 An explicit tax on \n                                                 \n1  Since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 1980\u20131985, annual investments in roads varied at 0.6%\u20131.5% of gross domestic \nproduct, with an average of 1.1%. \n2  Meaning \" Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program.\" \n3  Bharat Nirman (meaning \"build India\") is a comprehensive rural infrastructure development scheme begun in 2005, \nand  consisting  of  six  components  (irrigation,  rural  housing,  rural  drinking  water,  rural  electrification,  rural \ntelecommunication, and rural roads). \n4 The tax was initially set at Rs1 per liter, for both gasoline and diesel, and then increased to Rs1.50 per liter (about \n$0.03 per liter) in 2003. In 2004, $438 million from the Central Road Fund  went to the construction and \nmaintenance of national highways, $222 million to state highways, and $511 million to rural roads (Source: Ministry \nof Finance). \n \n ", "Appendix 2  21 \n \nfuel (gasoline and high-speed diesel oil) provides the funds for the Central Road Fund, and \ncollects around $1.23 billion yearly. The tax is first deposited in the Consolidated Fund of India \nand is then transferred into the Central Road Fund with the approval of Parliament. The Central \nRoad Fund is controlled by the Ministry of Finance. Its funds are allocated for national, state, \nand rural roads as defined in the act. Central Road Fund allocations for the national highways \nare earmarked for implementing the NHDP. This assured revenue stream has enabled the \nNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to raise debt funds to finance its program. The \ncorresponding allocations for state highways and rural roads are significant additional resources \nfor these subsectors. \n \n4.  India\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP)  for  2007\u20132012  continues  to  emphasize  the \ndevelopment of physical infrastructure as the key to promoting broad-based economic growth, \ndeveloping agriculture and the rural economy, and enhancing the competitiveness of Indian \nindustry and services. While the infrastructure development programs initiated during the 9th \nand 10th FYPs (including both the NHDP and Bharat Nirman) will continue, the Government \nplans to supplement these by setting up special economic zones and special economic regions \nto promote focused infrastructure development.5 The public sector would take the lead in \nmaking infrastructure investment in the lagging parts of India. In tandem, the Government is \nalso promoting the use of public\u2013private partnership (PPP) in areas such as highways, urban \ninfrastructure, mass rapid-transit systems, and tourism infrastructure. To mobilize long-term \nfunds for infrastructure development, the 11th FYP will aim to develop and tap the insurance \nand pension industry. In addition, long-term funding from development partners such as ADB \nwould continue to be important, especially in view of the current financial and economic crisis.  \n \nTable A2.1: Government Strategy and ADB Assistance \nSecondary Network: State \nItem  Primary Network:  Highways and Major District  Tertiary Network: \nNational Highways  Roads  Rural Roads \nLength  (km)  60,000  600,000  2,700,000 \nGovernment  NHDP I (Golden  Special Accelerated Road  PMGSY: connect all \nScheme and  Quadrilateral) by 2007    Development Program for the  habitations with population \nImmediate  North-Eastern Region (SARDP- of 1,000 and above (500 in \nNHDP II (north\u2013south and \nTarget   NE) to complete by 2012  the case of hilly or tribal \neast\u2013west corridors) by \nareas) by 2009 \n2009  For other states, allocation of \nfinancial support to capital \nNHDP III 1st phase by 2009 \ninvestment and maintenance \nSARDP-NE phase A to \n \ncomplete by 2012 \nLength  6,000 under NHDP I  2,500 in the northeastern region  370,000 under PMGSY \nTargeted for  under SARDP-NE \n7,300 under NHDP II   \nImprovement  \n \n(km)  10,000 under NHDP III \n3,251 under SARDP-NE \nFunding  NHDP I and II: $15.1 billion  $2.7 billion for SARDP-NE  $11 billion by 2009 \nRequirements  for capital financing \n(including national highway) \nto Meet \nNHDP III: $12.5 billion \nImmediate \nTarget   $2.7 billion for SARDP-NE \n(including secondary roads) \n                                                 \n5  Special economic regions differ from special economic zones in that they are not eligible for export tax benefits. \n ", "22  Appendix  2 \n \nSecondary Network: State \nItem  Primary Network:  Highways and Major District  Tertiary Network: \nNational Highways  Roads  Rural Roads \nGovernment  Earmarked cess on petrol  Earmarked cess on petrol and  Earmarked cess on petrol \nFunding  and diesel  diesel and other budgetary  and diesel \nStrategy   support  \nTolls  Multilateral funding for \nState budgetary allocation  10 core states \nMultilateral funding  \nTolls  Market borrowing by states \nMarket borrowing \n(proposed) \nMultilateral funding \n \nMarket borrowing \nOngoing ADB  For NHDP II  West Bengal: $79.2 million  Rural Roads Sector I: \nAssistance  (2001)  $400 million (2003, \nEast\u2013West Corridor: \nChhattisgarh and Madhya \n$320 million (2002)  Madhya Pradesh: $150 million \nPradesh) \n(2002) \nNational Highway Corridor \nRural Roads Sector II \n(Sector): $400 million (2003)  Chhattisgarh: $180 million \nInvestment Program: \n(2003) \nNational Highway Sector II:  $750 million MFF (2005; \n$400 million (2004)  Uttaranchal: $550 million MFF  Assam, Orissa, and West \n(2006)  Bengal) \nNational Highway Corridor \n(Sector) \u2013 supplementary:  Madhya Pradesh II: $320 million \n$100 million (2009)  (2007) \n  Bihar: $420 million (2008) \n \n   \nSources: Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

Upkeep of the \nstate  roads  and  districts  roads  are  normally  entrusted  to  state  government  public  works \ndepartments (or their equivalent). The Government\u2019s strategy has been to provide financial \nsupport to the state governments from the earmarked tax on gasoline and diesel oil, or through \nbudgetary allocation. The 12th Finance Commission recommended additional grants of Rs150 \nbillion  for  maintenance  of  roads  and  bridges  from  FY2006  through  FY2009.  Despite  the \nsubstantial central assistance, funds have been inadequate and generally poorly managed. Half \nof the secondary network has a poor-quality road surface.  \n \n6.  Following the launch of the NHDP and PMGSY, with strong central backing for funding \nand project management, the secondary network is now seen as the weakest link of the overall \nroad network in India. In addition to funding shortages, the 11th FYP lists the following as key \nconstraints in the state road subsector: \n \n(i)  Inadequate resources. More projects are sanctioned than can be undertaken using \navailable resources, leading to available funds being spread too thinly, and resulting \nin time and cost overruns. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  23 \n \n(ii)  Preconstruction  activity  delays.  Work  has  at  times  been  awarded  without \nacquisition  of  all  the  land  required  for  the  project,  affecting  acquisition  of  the \nenvironmental clearance and the shifting/removal of utilities. \n \n(iii)    Weak management by contractors. Several measures have been taken by the \ncontracting industry to acquire state-of-the-art equipment and procure good technical \nand  managerial  staff,  but  considerable  scope  exists  for  improving  project \nmanagement, and scheduling of human resources and equipment. \n \n(iv)     Poor implementation capacity. The state public works departments are required to \nbe capable of meeting current needs, in terms of modern technology and commercial \nmanagement principles. In many states there is a need to improve their capacity for \nplanning, designing, and executing works to meet the transport demands of users. \nConsiderable  scope  also  exists  for  enhancing  the  training  arrangements  for \nengineering personnel. Improvement is also required in the contracting industry and \nconsultancy sector. \n \nC.  Jharkhand Road Sector\u2014Overview \n  \n1.  Background \n \n7.  The state of Jharkhand, which was created in November 2000 by dividing the state of \nBihar, has an area of around 79,700 square km (km2). It is surrounded by Bihar (to the north), \nWest Bengal (to the east), Orissa (to the south), Chhattisgarh (to the southwest), and Uttar \nPradesh (to the west). The 2001 census recorded a population of 26.9 million, 26% of which \nwas tribal. \n \n8.  The main transport corridor connecting New Delhi (the capital) and Kolkata runs through \nthe state. Industry is concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the state, which are fairly \nwell-served by both the railway network and national highways. The state's two airports (at \nRanchi and Jamshedpur) also primarily serve these areas. Roads are the primary form of \ntransport in rural areas, where 78% of the state's population lives.  \n \n2.  The Road Network and Administration \n \n9.  The road network in Jharkhand in 2008 is described in Table A2.2. Jharkhand has 58 km \nof road per 100,000 population (compared to the average for India of 257 km per 100,000 \npopulation), and a road density of 18 km per 100 km2, (compared to the average for India of 75 \nkm per 100 km2). The state\u2019s road penetration is inadequate, with some 74% of habitations not \nconnected with all-weather roads. \n \n10.  There are three organizations involved in the management of road infrastructure in \nJharkhand. NHAI is entrusted to maintain and improve, under NHDP, key sections of national \nhighways including 190 km of National Highway 2 (NH2), which forms part of the Delhi\u2013Kolkata \nlink of the \u201cgolden quadrilateral\u201d. Other national highways, state highways, and district roads \ntotaling about 6,900 km are the responsibility of the Road Construction Department (RCD) of \nthe state government of Jharkhand (GOJH). Other district roads and village roads are under the \nRural Works Department, which executes the rural roads improvement scheme under PMGSY. \n \n11.  RCD is the primary state department involved in development of road infrastructure, and \nis responsible for construction and maintenance of roads on behalf of GOJH. Its organizational \n ", "24  Appendix  2 \n \nstructure is typical for public works departments in Indian states. It is headed by a politically \nappointed minister. A secretary, who reports to the minister, is responsible for assisting with \nframing  and  implementing  state  policy,  monitoring  the  progress  of  road  works and  overall \ndepartmental performance. The engineer-in-chief reports to the secretary and is in charge of the \nimplementation of works program. The engineer-in-chief is supported by three chief engineers\u2014\none each for communication, central design organization, and national highways\u2014who are all \nbased in Ranchi. \n \nTable A2.2: Roads in Jharkhand \nLength  Allocation of Ownership and Responsibility of  \nNo.  Class of Road  (km)  Development and Maintenance  \n1.

The chief engineers are supported by superintending engineers, who oversee \u201ccircles\u201d, \nunder which there are divisions headed by executive engineers. Executive engineers are the \nbasic operations units and are responsible for management of works including contracts and \npayment for works. In every division, subdivisions are headed by assistant engineers who \nmanage  and  supervise  works  within  their  subdivision.  This  involves  design  and  contract \nmanagement including quality control and testing. Assistant engineers are required to check the \nquality and quantity of works. Under every subdivision are sections headed by junior engineers \nwho are the basic field functionaries and responsible for managing actual construction activity in \nthe field, taking measurements, giving day-to-day guidance, and reporting to the assistant \nengineer. The overall staff strength of RCD includes, in addition to the engineer-in-chief and the \nthree  chief engineers, 16  superintending  engineers,  43  executive  engineers,  255  assistant \nengineers and approximately 800 junior engineers. These are sanctioned positions and actual \nstaffing levels are lower.  \n \n13.  The chief engineer (communication) is responsible for all state highways and major \ndistrict roads, under five circles and 23 divisions across the state. In addition, a superintending \nengineer (mechanical) based in Ranchi is responsible for rollers, hot-mix plants, and other \ndepartmental equipment, which was reserved for use on departmental works. However, the \ndepartment  currently  does  not  carry  out  its  own  works,  and  contractors  are  supposed  to \nmobilize their own equipment, meaning this wing is now defunct. The chief engineer (national \nhighways) is supported by two superintending engineers, one each at Ranchi and Dhanbad. \nThese superintending engineers in turn supervise seven divisions across the state. \n \n14.  The central design organization prepares, checks, and clears the design of roads and \nbridges under the state's responsibility and has been outsourcing the detailed project report \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \n \npreparation to consultants since 2002. The original reports for the Govindpur\u2013Sahebganj road \nwere also prepared by consultants.  \n \n3.  Road Expenditures \n \n15.  The budget allocation for both the plan (capital expenditure) and non-plan (recurrent \nexpenditure) budget has increased steadily.6 The budget allocation for RCD increased by a \nfactor of 2.5 from FY2003 to FY2007, while the budget expenditure increased by only a factor of \n1.8. Much of the underspending comes under the plan budget.7 Compared to the historically low \nspending ratio under plan budget, the maintenance budget is better utilized (about 85% of the \nbudget allocation for FY2007 was used).  Table A2.3 summarizes the plan and non-plan budget \nallocations and expenditures. \n \nTable A2.3: Road Construction Department Budget Allocation and Expenditure \n(Rs million) \nItem  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007 \nBudget Allocation               \n   Plan  1,950.0  2,600.0  3,000.0  5,240.0  5,469.6 \n   Non-plan  1,108.5  1,380.6  1,929.6  1,970.3  2,300.1 \n     Wages and Salaries  688.5  880.6  1,189.6  1,230.3  1,120.9 \n   Maintenance of   \n420.0  500.0  740.0  740.0  1,179.2 \n     Roads and Bridges \n   Total  3,058.5  3,980.6  4,929.6  7,210.3  7,769.7 \nExpenditure               \n   Plan  1,680.0  2,210.0  2,370.0  1,452.1  3,005.1 \n   Non-plan  1,101.7  1,078.6  1,715.7  1,801.1  2,015.2 \n     Wages and Salaries  688.4  689.0  1,064.1  1,226.3  989.5 \n   Maintenance of   \n413.3  389.6  651.6  574.8  1,025.7 \n     Roads and Bridges \n   Total  2,781.7  3,288.6  4,085.7  3,253.2  5,020.3 \n   Source: State Government of Jharkhand. \n \nD.  Jharkhand Road Sector\u2014Issues and Government Approach \n \n16.  The constraints identified in the 11th FYP self-assessment are also present in Jharkhand \nand are much more pronounced. However, Jharkhand's state road sector has several unique \nfeatures that would necessitate adjustments to the approach adopted by ADB in designing \ninterventions in other states. \n \n1.  Underdeveloped Road Network \n  \n17.  Except for West Bengal, the states receiving ADB financial assistance for the state road \nsector are those which were divided in 2000: Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were created \nfrom the former Madhya Pradesh; Uttarakhand (formerly Uttaranchal) occupies the hilly portion \nof the former Uttar Pradesh; and the present-day Bihar occupies the plain areas of the former \nundivided Bihar (Jharkhand was created by dividing Bihar). Of these five bifurcated states, \n                                                 \n6  Recurrent expenditure includes expenditure for road maintenance and wages and salaries. \n7  A preliminary figure from FY2008 shows a significant improvement, with 94% of the allocated plan budget utilized. \n ", "26  Appendix  2 \n \nUttarakhand is a hill state, and its road network differs from those of the four flatter plain states. \nComparison of the four plain states reveals stark differences between the road network in \nJharkhand and the other three states.  \n \n18.  Jharkhand\u2019s road network is much smaller and less dense than those of the other three \nplain states. In 2002, the overall road length was less than one-third that of Chhattisgarh, which \nhad a smaller population, and an area not more than double that of Jharkhand. The total length \nof surfaced roads was approximately one-tenth that of Chhattisgarh. In terms of the size and \nquality of the road network, Jharkhand was severely underdeveloped. Since it was formed in \n2000, Jharkhand has not implemented any major road investments that alter the nature of its \nroad network. Considering the relative progress made in the other three states, Jharkhand's \npresent standing among these states may have slipped even further since 2002. 8    \n \nTable A2.4: Comparison of Road Network in ADB-Financed States  \nItem  Madhya Pradesh  Chhattisgarh  Bihar  Jharkhand \nPopulation (2001 census)  60,348,023  20,833,803  82,998,509  26,945,829 \nLand Area (km2)  308,252  135,237  94,164  79,714 \nRoad Length (km, in 2002)  160,968  35,372  76,065  11,486 \nOf which sealed (km, in 2002)  78,191  24,476  32,858  2,840 \nSealed Road Density (km/km2)  0.254  0.181  0.348  0.036 \nSource: Road Lengths from Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. \n \n19.  A 2002 RCD study (Road Infrastructure in Jharkhand\u2014Vision 2010) identified five major \ncorridors for focused investment, including the Govindpur\u2013Sahebganj road, which is proposed \nfor improvement under the Project.  To expand the state's road network, four stretches of road \ntotaling 554 km were newly declared as national highways, increasing the national highway \nlength  in  Jharkhand  to  1,844  km.  These  attempts  have  not  yet  resulted  in  any  visible \nimprovement to the state's road network, however. RCD expects that the proposed Project will \nbecome a breakthrough for sustained improvement of its road network.  \n \n2.  Smaller Organization \n  \n20.   Jharkhand\u2019s RCD has a much smaller staff than the Bihar RCD, with just 43 sanctioned \nexecutive engineer positions, compared to 378 in Bihar. The Jharkhand RCD is responsible for \n6,900 km of road, and the Bihar RCD for 14,000 km, meaning the staff strength of Jharkhand \nRCD is not proportional to its responsibility.  \n  \n21.  Staff costs in Jharkhand RCD accounted for 20.5% of the RCD budget allocation in \nFY2007 (a decrease from 24.7% in FY2003). During this period staff costs increased by 1.4 \ntimes, while works executed by Jharkhand RCD doubled. RCD suffers less from the financial \nburden  posed  by  the  staff  costs,  which  often  divert  non-plan  resources  away  from  road \nmaintenance in other public works departments.  \n \n3.  Road Construction Department Receptive to New Ideas \n  \n22.  RCD has been outsourcing construction works, in part because of its small staff size. It \nalso outsources detailed project report preparation and supervision of larger construction works. \nRCD has also initiated several reforms, based on lessons from other states in India. The \nJharkhand  Highway  Act  was  enacted  in  2006  and  provides  a  legal  framework  for  overall \n                                                 \n8  For consistency and ease of comparison, the data on road lengths was obtained from the website of the Ministry of \nRoad Transport and Highways (http://morth.nic.in/index2.asp?sublinkid=376&langid=2). \n ", "Appendix 2  27 \n \nhighway corridor management by GOJH, and future establishment of a highway authority. Rules \nunder the act came into force in 2007. RCD has drafted its own public works department code \nto replace the public works department code of Bihar that is currently in use. RCD also entered \ninto  a  project  development  agreement  with  Infrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  to \nidentify  highway  schemes  and  projects  that  could  be  undertaken  under  public\u2013private \npartnership options. A special purpose vehicle has been formed for this purpose. \n \n23.  RCD established a dedicated project implementation cell well in advance of the start of \nloan processing, and has increased its staff size. The required organizational setup for project \nimplementation is in place, including the high-level project coordination committee (chaired by \nthe chief secretary) and district-level task forces comprising district-level officers from all the \nconcerned  state  departments.  These  are  functional  and  helping  RCD  meet  the  readiness \nrequirements listed in the checklist developed by the Government\u2019s Ministry of Finance. \n \nE.  Jharkhand Road Sector\u2014ADB Approach \n \n24.  ADB's past assistance in India's state road subsector was designed to improve the \nphysical condition of road infrastructure while introducing various reforms to state-level road \nadministration. The results are mixed, as ADB\u2019s 2007 sector assistance program evaluation \n(SAPE) points out.9 One of the SAPE's key recommendations was to take into account local \nvariations in implementation capabilities and make better use of past experience to improve the \ndesign of future projects. In this regard, review of the two loans provided in 2002\u20132003 to the \nnewly bifurcated states is useful. \n \n25.  The recently completed Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Development Program \nwas generally seen as a successful intervention.10 Under the program loan, Madhya Pradesh \nRoad Development Corporation was created out of the Public Works Department with a lean \norganizational structure and many features of a modern organization for road infrastructure \nmanagement.  Under  the  Chhattisgarh  State  Roads  Development  Sector  Project,  similar \ninstitutional changes were attempted but the envisaged creation of a dedicated road authority \nhas not taken place.11 The policy action plan for institutional reform is being restructured to \naddress the changed scenario under which a special purpose vehicle was created in 2007 that \ncan function as a dedicated road authority.  \n \n26.  In  the  case  of  Jharkhand,  policy  decisions  and  enabling  legislation  for  efficient \ndevelopment and management of road infrastructure and greater private sector participation are \nalready  in  place.  However,  other  factors\u2014notably  the  frequent  changes  in  the  state's \ngovernment12\u2014have not encouraged or been conducive to the commencement of major road \nsector projects with private sector participation. NHAI invited tenders for the Ranchi\u2013Barhi road \n(one of the state\u2019s highest traffic corridors) three times on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis with no \nresponse from the private sector. How the recently formed special purpose vehicle will interest \nthe private sector remains to be seen.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2007.

ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance13 to RCD and helped design the \nProject,  which  has  a  simple  design  and  clear  decision-making  requirements  for ADB  loan \nprocessing. By strictly adhering to these requirements, all the necessary institutional changes \nare expected to be in place before the start of the Project. This will allow RCD to focus its \nscarce human resources on discharging its responsibility as the \u201cemployer\u201d of the FIDIC-based \ncivil works contracts, to effectively deliver the Project outputs and outcome.  \n                                                 \n13 Project preparatory technical assistance for State Roads Projects in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, processed in \n2007 as a component technical assistance under ADB. 2006.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBetween 2002 and 2006, India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 8.6% (based on 1999 constant \nprices). Transportation and communication (including trade), agriculture, and manufacturing were particularly strong, \nwith transportation, communication, and trade combined accounting for the highest share of the country\u2019s GDP \n(25.6%). This performance is largely responsible for the country\u2019s impressive economic growth, and for reducing \npoverty. Gains from economic growth have yet to be distributed equitably in some poor areas, however, including in \nthe state of Jharkhand. In December 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the 2009 country operations \nbusiness plan,a under which support for infrastructure development to promote inclusive growth will remain the core \nfocus of ADB\u2019s India assistance strategy. The Jharkhand State Roads Project, which aims to improve transport \nconnectivity within the state, will be the first support by ADB for Jharkhand\u2019s roads. The Project will augment transport \ncapacity in a financially sustainable manner. Jharkhand is one of the least-developed states in India, and the Project is \nexpected to have significant development impacts. Its short-term impacts on poverty reduction include employment of \npoor people in road construction and ensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly increase earnings, \nespecially for those who are largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment. Over the long term, the \nProject is expected to have a significant development impact\u2014e.g., through expanded economic activities due to \nimprovement of access to markets and other economic centers, and improved health and education caused by \nimproved access to health and educational facilities\u2014and thereby contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues \n  \nThe state of Jharkhand (India\u2019s 28th state) was created in November 2000 from the southern portion of the former \nundivided state of Bihar. It is bounded by five states: the (now smaller) state of Bihar to the north, West Bengal to the \neast, Orissa to the south and Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh to the west. Jharkhand covers an area of 79,714 square \nkilometers, with 22 districts, 32,616 revenue villages and a population of 27 million (according to the 2001 census). A \nsocioeconomic survey covering 20% of the affected population (1,243 household were interviewed) was conducted in \nAugust 2007, as well as community consultations and a focus group discussion. In addition, poverty analysis using \nprimary and secondary data, and a review of government programs and schemes were conducted. The data revealed \nthat Jharkhand has one of the highest levels of poverty in India, with a sharp contrast between rural and urban poverty. \nThe poverty incidence in Jharkhand is 44%, compared with 26% for India as a whole. Although Jharkhand has \nextensive natural resources (mainly minerals and forests), the majority of its population (80%) resides in rural areas \nand remains largely dependant on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihoods. Agricultural activities are usually \nundertaken during the monsoon period, as this provides the only source of irrigation for most agricultural land. By \nrehabilitating  the  Govindpur\u2013Sahebganj  road,  the  Project  will  connect  regional  communities  to  the  district  and \ncommercial centers. Some of the immediate benefits will be improved access to socioeconomic facilities, safe and \ncomfortable journeys with reduced fuel consumption and vehicle operating costs, and development of the rural \neconomy. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe August 2007 socioeconomic survey revealed that only 1.45% of interviewed households reported agriculture as \ntheir main source of livelihood. Most (80%) reported having more than one livelihood, for example combining \nagriculture with nonagricultural labor and business or trade. The average landholding is small (1\u20132 acres or 0.4\u20130.8 \nhectares),  necessitating  multiple  livelihoods  to  supplement  the  basic  income  and  harvests  generated  through \nsubsistence agriculture. The households interviewed felt that road improvements would lead to more frequent and \nmore reliable bus services, thereby considerably reducing travel costs and times. Households engaged in wage labor \nviewed improved mobility as providing the opportunity to obtain better-paying jobs outside their villages. Labor \nopportunities in the Project\u2019s road construction work were seen as additional immediate project benefits for wage \nlaborers.     \n \n ", "Appendix 9  39 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations and meetings with the project communities were organized during the course of the social analysis to \nascertain their response to the construction of roads, their needs and demands from the Project, and any risks or \nconcerns emerging from the Project. A total of 14 focus group discussions were organized during the course of the \nsocial assessment with local communities, and included men, women, farmers, indigenous people, Scheduled Castes, \nhigh-income groups, the poor, shopkeepers, truckers, etc., to ensure a comprehensive perspective was obtained on \nthe Project and its impacts. Other key stakeholders, such as Panchayati Raj (local government) members (e.g., village \nhead, village health workers, block development officers, health workers, and school teachers) were also consulted by \nmeans of key stakeholder discussions. In addition, consultations were also undertaken with the affected households \nand communities during the course of the resettlement census surveys undertaken for each of the Project\u2019s four \n\u201cpackages\u201d. Details of these consultations are provided in the respective resettlement plans.  \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?                       Yes      No  \n \nInformation dissemination material such as brochures, pamphlets and posters detailing resettlement information \nincluding measurement of losses, detailed asset valuations, entitlements and special provisions, grievance procedures, \ntiming of payments and displacement schedules will be printed for distribution to affected people. This will be carried \nout during implementation of resettlement plans by local nongovernment organizations. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey Issues. During the social study a gender analysis was undertaken to assess the Project\u2019s impact. Six focus group \ndiscussions were held with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups, such as scheduled tribes and castes. \nThe discussions revealed that the women in the project area are engaged primarily in household chores and farming. \nThe primary school enrollment ratio of males and females is about equal, but female enrollment decreases at higher \neducation levels, with a sharp drop in female enrolment after middle school. One reason quoted for the drop in female \nenrolment was the lack of higher schools in and around villages, and the lack of access to higher education. \nConsequently, many households declined to send their girls to schools outside the village, because of concerns about \nsecurity and the lack of mobility. It is also nearly impossible for many women to access health facilities at night and \nduring the rainy season, jeopardizing the lives of both mother and child in emergencies during childbirth. Women said \nthat the Project would considerably improve their access to better health care services outside their villages. They also \nvoiced some concerns with regard to the safety of their children, as they were of the opinion that the widening and \nrehabilitating the road would increase the number of the vehicles, thereby increasing hazards for children, the elderly, \nand women.   \n \n2.

The results indicated the scheduled tribe/  Peoples \nindigenous households have similar characteristics to the  Framework \noverall population and are largely assimilated into the     No Action \nlocal communities. This can be attributed to the fact that \nthe road to be improved under the Project has been in \nexistence for many years, exposing both the scheduled \ntribes and non-scheduled-tribe households to the outside \nworld.  Consequently,  the  Project  will  not  have  any \nadverse  or  differential  impacts  on  customary,  tribal, \nsocial,  cultural,  economic  or  political  behaviors  or \ninstitutions, and indigenous peoples will benefit equally \nfrom  the  socioeconomic  opportunities  created  by  the \nProject.  \n \nThe adverse impact of the  Project on the scheduled \ntribes will be due to land acquisition.

The Jharkhand State Roads Project will upgrade 310.7 kilometers of existing roads in \none of the state\u2019s least developed areas. The state of Jharkhand, formerly part of southern \nBihar, became India\u2019s 28th state in November 2000. The Project, which will be the first ADB \nintervention in Jharkhand\u2019s road sector, aims to improve transport connectivity within the state \nto facilitate balanced development and reduce regional socioeconomic disparities. Under the \nProject, the existing road will be widened and converted into a two-lane state highway.1 The \nProject has been subdivided into four packages, with the detailed design of all alignments \ncompleted for all packages. Resettlement plans for each of these packages have been prepared \nbased on these detailed designs. The details of the four road sections are listed in Table A10.1.  \nTable A10.1: Project Road Packages \nLength \nPackage No.  Name   Districts Covered  (km) \nI  Govindpur\u2013Jamtara  Dhanbad, Jamtara  69.7 \nJamtara Bypass  11.0 \nII  Jamtara\u2013Dumka  Jamtara,  Dumka,  75.5  \nDumka Bypass  Deoghar  6.5 \nIII  Dumka\u2013Barhet  Sahebganj,  Dumka,  98.1 \nPakur \nIV  Barhet\u2013Sahebganj  Sahebganj  49.9  \nkm = kilometer  \nSource: Road Construction Department, State Government of Jharkhand \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n2.  To assess the Project\u2019s resettlement impacts, a census survey based on detailed road \ndesigns was undertaken from January to August 2008. The census revealed that despite having \nmade considerable efforts to minimize resettlement impacts, a total of 150 hectares of private \nland will need to be acquired.2 The resettlement census found that 4,515 households will incur \nimpacts on the following assets: 4,143 agricultural plots, 1,489 residential structures, and 680 \ncommercial or commercial-cum-residential structures. In 93% of all cases involving land, these \nimpacts will affect less than 10% of the area of the plot. Over half (56%) of the impacts to \nstructures will affect only boundary walls, gates and gardens, with little or no impacts on the \nmain structures. These project impacts are presented in Table A10.2. \n                                                 \n1   Jharkhand state highway technical specifications call for an average width of 30\u201340 meters. In the case of Jamtara \nand Dumka bypasses, technical specifications call for a total widening of up to 60 meters in some places.  \n2  To minimize resettlement impacts (i) community bypasses will be constructed in several village areas, (ii) the \nproject has been designed to largely follow the existing road alignment outside of developed areas, (iii) \u201ctoe\u201d \nretaining walls will be introduced in some areas of high fill construction, and (iv) traffic will be managed during \nconstruction.

Resettlement Policy and Legal Framework \n3.  In accordance with the Jharkhand resettlement and rehabilitation norms for the Project, \nand incorporating the ADB Involuntary Resettlement  Policy (1995) and Operations Manual \nsection on involuntary resettlement,3 all affected households will be entitled to a combination of \ncompensation  measures  and  resettlement  assistance,  depending  on  the  nature  of  their \nownership rights over the affected assets and the scope of the impact, including the social and \neconomic vulnerability of the affected persons. In general terms, the affected persons in the \nproject will be entitled to six types of compensation and assistance:  \n(i)  compensation for loss of land, trees, etc. at replacement value;  \n(ii)  compensation  for  structures  (residential/commercial)  and  other  immovable \nassets at replacement value;  \n(iii)  assistance for loss of business/wage income;  \n(iv)  assistance for shifting;  \n(v)  rebuilding and/or restoration of community resources/facilities; and \n(vi)  special additional assistance for vulnerable households.  \n4.  Based on the inventory of losses conducted during the resettlement census carried out \nin  consultation  with  affected  households,  an  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A10.3)  has  been \ndeveloped. The matrix provides the basic tools and guidelines for preparation of compensation \nand resettlement benefits. Compensation rates and assistances have been fixed in consultation \nwith state and local officials and other stakeholders.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006.

Public Consultation and Disclosure of Information \n5.  Local stakeholders were consulted during the social and poverty assessment. Similarly, \ncommunity  consultations  were  conducted  during  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plans. \nSummaries of the resettlement plans will be translated into Hindi and Santhali and will be made \navailable for review and comments by means of four package-level disclosure workshops prior \nto loan negotiations. Copies of the summary resettlement plans will also be made available at \nlocal-level public offices (such as revenue offices and gram panchayat). The final resettlement \nplan endorsed by the executing agency (EA) will also be disclosed on the RCD and ADB \nwebsites. Furthermore, experienced and well-qualified nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) \nor agencies will be engaged to assist the EA in the effective, timely and efficient implementation \nof  the  resettlement  plans  for  each  road  package.  The  NGOs  and/or  agencies  will  act  as \nfacilitators and serve to link the project implementation cell (PIC) within RCD and the affected \ncommunities. The NGOs and/or agencies will inform the affected persons regarding project-\nrelated  land  acquisition  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  measures  and  ensure  proper \ncompensation and assistance are extended to the affected persons under the resettlement and \nrehabilitation entitlement package.  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements and Grievance Redress \n6.  The Jharkhand RCD is the EA and will be responsible for overall strategic guidance, \ntechnical supervision, project execution, and ensuring compliance with loan covenants. The PIC \nwill be established in Ranchi (the state capital), headed by a full-time director who reports to the \nRCD secretary. The PIC will ensure internal monitoring and report any changes in the project \ndesign.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  if  design  changes  are  made  that  have \nresettlement impacts. The PIC will also ensure that resettlement budgets are delivered on time \nfor resettlement plan implementation. A field-based district implementation cell, headed by an \nexecutive engineer and assisted by a dedicated resettlement and rehabilitation officer will be \nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  district \nimplementation  cell  will  be  assisted  by  local  NGOs/resettlement  and  rehabilitation \nimplementation agencies.  \n7.  A grievance redress cell comprising the executive engineer, local NGO representative, \ncommunity leaders (nonpolitical), and representatives of affected persons (including women and \nvulnerable groups) will be established at the district level to address and resolve community \ngrievances.  To  facilitate  interdepartmental  coordination  and  ensure  speedy  resolution  of \ngrievances,  a  task  force  chaired  by  the  district  collector  and  comprising  the  district  land \nacquisition officer, district forest officer, executive engineer, and additional district magistrate \nand relief officer has been constituted at each district.  \nF.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n8.  The  cost  of  resettlement  plan  implementation  (including  all  costs  related  to  land \nacquisition, compensation, resettlement assistance, transport, monitoring and evaluation) is \n$17.09 million. The EA will make the required funds available to cover all compensation and \nresettlement and rehabilitation costs.  \nG.  Implementation Schedule \n9.  The  proposed  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  activities  are  divided  into  three  broad \ncategories\u2014the  project  preparation  phase,  resettlement  plan  implementation  phase,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation\u2014based on the stages of work and implementation process. The \n ", "Appendix 10  47 \nmajor activities to be performed during the preparation phase include establishment of PIC at \nproject  and  subproject  levels,  submission  of  a  resettlement  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  approval, \nappointment of NGOs, and establishment of the grievance redress cell. An orientation and \ntraining in resettlement management will be provided under the Project by the ADB consultant \nto the NGOs/resettlement and rehabilitation implementing agencies. The information campaign \nand community consultation will be initiated at this stage and continue until the end of the \nProject. Implementation of the resettlement plan will follow the preparatory phase and includes \n(i) issuing  of  compensation  and  awards  by  the  EA,  (ii)  payment  of  eligible  assistance, \n(iii) relocation  of  affected  persons,  and  (iv)  initiation  of  economic  rehabilitation  measures. \nSubsequent  activities  include  site  preparation  for  delivering  the  site  to  contractors  for \nconstruction, and commencement of civil works. \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n10.  The resettlement plan will have both internal and external monitoring. Internal monitoring \nwill be a regular activity for the PIC, which will oversee the timely implementation of resettlement \nand rehabilitation activities. Internal monitoring will be carried out by the PIC and its agents, \nsuch  as  the  NGOs/resettlement  and  rehabilitation  implementing  agencies  and  will  prepare \nmonthly reports on the progress of resettlement plan implementation.
