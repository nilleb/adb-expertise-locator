The project is in line with \nthe  ongoing  efforts  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  to \nsupport the progressive upgrading of the entire national road network.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nFrom  1975  to  1999,  a  struggle  for  independence  in  Timor-Leste  led  to  a  prolonged \n3. \nviolent  conflict.  Timor-Leste  gained  independence  in  2002  after  a  brief  period  under  United \nNations  administration.  However,  it  had  suffered  massive  losses  of  livelihoods,  social  capital, \nand  basic  social  services.  Public  infrastructure  had  been  destroyed  or  become  dilapidated. \nInternational  assistance  was  provided  to  start  building  government  institutional  capacity  and \nstate  authority  from  scratch.  However,  from  2006  to  2008,  internal  factionalism  resulted  in  the \ntemporary displacement of nearly a quarter of the population, which disrupted recovery efforts. \nInternational  support  for  maintaining  law  and  order  was  again  required  until  2012.  While \nconsiderable  progress  has  been  made,  Timor-Leste  remains fragile  and  its  institutions  remain \nweak in many respects. ADB\u2019s institutional approach to achieving development effectiveness in \na fragile and conflict-affected situation (FCAS) is relevant to the design of the project.3 \n \n4. \nSince 2005, Timor-Leste's economy has derived most of its income from offshore oil and \ngas.  Its  sovereign  wealth  fund  had  accumulated  more  than  $13  billion  by  March  2013.4   With \nwithdrawals  from  the  fund  prudently  managed,  it  is  well  placed  financially  to  invest  in \ndevelopment.  Government  spending  has  generated  strong  economic  momentum  with  gross \ndomestic  product  (excluding  the  petroleum  sector  and  United  Nations  contribution)  growing  at \nan  average  annual  rate  of  11.7%  between  2008  and  2012.  The  economy  is  forecast  to  grow \n9.5%  in  2013  and  10%  in  2014,  driven  by  continuing  government  spending. 5 The  effect  of \ngovernment  spending  on  stimulating  business  opportunities  and  investment  are  expected  to \nunderpin long-term prospects for private sector development and future economic growth.  \n \n5. \nIn  2011,  the  government  published  its  Strategic  Development  Plan  (SDP),  2011\u20132030, \nwhich  aims  to  sustain  economic  growth  and  fast-track  economic  development  to  achieve  a \nmodern  and  diversified  economy  with  high-quality  infrastructure.  The  SDP  envisages  three \npillars  for  development:  social  capital  development,  infrastructure  development,  and  economic \ndevelopment. Public investment (including roads) over the first 5 years of the SDP is intended to \ncreate  the  conditions  to  attract  private  investment  and  ensure  an  economy  led  by  the  private \nsector  by  2030.  An  efficient  and  safe  transport  system  is  essential  to  achieving  the  three \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2012.

Pacific Economic Monitor July 2013, Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndevelopmental  pillars.  The  SDP  and  the  operational  plans  of  the  government  emphasize  the \nupgrading of roads.  \n \n6. \nAlignment  with  country  strategies  is  an  important  element  of  engagement  in  an  FCAS. \nAdditionally, engagement in an FCAS should promote inclusive growth. Economic expansion in \nDili is encouraging rural\u2013urban migration, but high youth unemployment and high demands on \nbasic services in the city are emerging issues. Diversification of economic activity beyond Dili is \nneeded to help stem these pressures and spread the benefits of petroleum wealth more widely. \nAn efficient transport network is central to economic diversification and national integration. \n \n7. \nThe  poor  condition  of  the  roads  results  in high  costs  and  unreliable services. The core \nnetwork comprises 1,426 km of national roads and 869 km of district roads. About 3,000 km of \nrural roads provide access to villages and more remote areas. Only about 8% of the core road \nnetwork  is  assessed  to  be  in  fair  condition  and  about  70%  in  very  poor  condition,6 which  is \nconstraining  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to  emerge  from  fragility.  Support  is  essential  to  bring  about \n\u201cquick wins\u201d and transformational changes to the road network to underpin economic progress \nand social stability.  \n \n8. \nThe  MPW,  with  ADB  assistance,  has  developed  the  Medium-Term  Road  Network \nDevelopment  Program,  the  implementation  of  which  started  in  2010.  The  Road  Network \nDevelopment  Sector  Project,  the  Road  Network  Upgrading  Project,  and  projects  supported  by \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  World  Bank  are  being  implemented  and \nwill  upgrade  about  356  km  of  road.7 These  projects  supported  by  Timor-Leste\u2019s  development \npartners  are  closely  coordinated  and  are  piloting  performance-based  road  maintenance  by \nincluding  2-year  post  construction  maintenance  in  the  construction  contracts.  Performance-\nbased  maintenance  will  help  alleviate  capacity  shortages  that  constrain  effective  road \nmaintenance.  Local  contractors  now  have  the  capacity  for  such  maintenance,  but  they  do  not \nhave the capacity for major upgrading work. International contractors will be needed in the short \nand medium term.8   \n \n9. \nRoad  safety  is  a  related  and  emerging  issue.  Inadequate  enforcement  of  regulations, \nlack  of  road  safety  awareness,  and  poor  road  conditions  contribute  to  high  accident  rates.  In \n2012,  76  people  died  on  Timor-Leste\u2019s  roads,  according  to  traffic  police  data.  However,  the \nWorld  Health  Organization\u2019s  2013  Global  Status  Report  on  Road  Safety  suggests  significant \nunderreporting of fatalities and gives a likely point estimate of 190 deaths\u2014or 19.5 per 100,000 \npopulation. 9 The  vehicle  fleet  is  expanding  rapidly,  especially  motorcycles,  with  a  threefold \nincrease in motorcycles between 2005 and 2009.  \n \n10. \nThe MPW is responsible for planning, developing, and maintaining roads. In many FCAS, \nhuman  capacity  shortages  are  a  major  constraint.  The  MPW\u2019s  Directorate  of  Roads,  Bridges, \nand Flood Control (DRBFC) has only 12 engineers, severely limiting its capacity to manage the \nroad  infrastructure.  More  professional  staff,  particularly  new  graduates,  are  required  to  make \n\n                                                \n6  ADB.  2008.

ADB supports the preparation of a medium-term capacity \ndevelopment    framework    for    the    MPW.10   Ongoing    technical    assistance    (TA)    supports \nscholarships  and  a  technical  upgrading  program.11 Twinning  arrangements  with  public  works \nand  highways  departments  in  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines  are  being  developed.  A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will continue to be essential for the management of projects financed \nby development partners. In line with FCAS principles, the PMU will be gradually integrated with \nthe line ministry.  \n \nSince  1999,  ADB  has  been  the  lead  development  agency  in  the  road  sector.  It  has \n11. \nprovided  six  TA  projects,  three  project  grants,  one  sector  grant,  and  two  loans  for  the  road \nsector. The  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2011\u20132015 12  continues  ADB\u2019s  strategic \ndirections  by  concentrating  on  infrastructure  development  and  management.  ADB  plans  to \nprovide  complementary  assistance  in  the  core  specializations  of  finance,  regional  cooperation \nand  integration,  and  education.  ADB  will  also  support  the  private  sector  as  a  key  driver  of \nchange to help make the transition from an economy led by the public sector.13 ADB support for \ninfrastructure,  financial  services,  and  skills  training  will  help  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing \neconomy. An emphasis on the provision of services outside the capital will support growth of the \nrural  economy.  Poverty  will  be  reduced,  particularly  in  rural  areas,  by  connecting  the  poor  to \nmarkets and expanding the availability of basic public services.  \n \nThe emphasis in the CPS on infrastructure reflects its importance to the achievement of \n12. \nthe government\u2019s development priorities for 2011\u20132017, as well as ADB\u2019s established presence \nand comparative strength in infrastructure. ADB will help coordinate capacity development and \ninvestment  programming  across  infrastructure  sectors  (particularly  road  transport,  and  water \nand sanitation), and help mobilize financial resources for infrastructure investment. \n \n13. \nThe Road Network Upgrading Sector Project will upgrade priority sections of the national \nroad  network. The  project  will finance  the  upgrading  of the  trans-island  road from  Manatuto  to \nthe \nNatarbora,  which  will  greatly \ngovernment\u2019s  petroleum  and  gas  developments  on  the  south  coast. 14 The  project  will  also \nfinance the preparation of other high-priority road links. \n \nThe  project  seeks  to  increase  the  scale  of  ADB\u2019s  support  by  leveraging  the \n14. \ngovernment\u2019s financial capacity for investment in infrastructure, as effective programs in FCAS \noften have fewer but larger projects consistent with priority public investment programs (footnote \n3).  Other  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  projects  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  These \ninclude  (i)  paying  sufficient  attention  to  climate  resilience  in  project  design,  (ii)  using  sector \napproaches to allow the government to progressively expand its leadership in the road sector, \n(iii) paying  attention  to  institutional  capacity  and  long-term  road  maintenance  strategies  to \nachieve sustainability,  and (iv)  encouraging community  participation  in roadwork  to extend the \nbenefits of national road development to roadside communities.15 \n \n\nimprove  national  connectivity  and  directly  support \n\n                                                \n10  ADB. 2007.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility,  a commitment charge  of  0.15%  per  year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreements.16 The  ordinary  capital  resources \nloan  from  ADB  will  finance  civil  works,  consultants\u2019  services,  taxes  and  duties,  late  payment \ncharges  imposed  by  suppliers  and  contractors,  bank  charges,  local  transport  and  insurance \ncharges, and interest during construction.17  \n \n19. \nThe  government  has  also  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR \n6,672,000  ($10  million)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per \nannum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  agreement.

While  each  development  partner  maintains  separate  responsibility  for  its  respective \nprojects,  close  collaboration  reduces  project  management  costs  by  facilitating  the  use  of \nstandardized  approaches,  as  well  as  safeguards  assessments  and  monitoring.  The  basic \nfunctions of the PMU are financed by ongoing projects. The project will create an environmental \nand social unit within the PMU by providing international and national environmental specialists, \nresettlement specialists, and a social and gender development specialist. \n                                                \n16 The government has opted for a straight-line repayment option; the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the \n\nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per annum. \n\n17 Financing  of  late  payment  charges  and  bank  charges  will  avoid  potential  administrative  delays.  The  amount  of \ntaxes and duties (i) is within the reasonable threshold identified during the CPS preparation, (ii) does not represent \nan  excessive  share  of  the  project  investment  plan,  and  (iii)  will  only  be  financed  for  ADB-financed  expenditures. \nFinancing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThe  PMU  will  undertake  the  day-to-day  project  management,  and  assist  the  National \n23. \nProcurement  Commission  with  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  and \nconsultants  services. To  align  the  project  with government  systems, the  National  Procurement \nCommission will also procure civil works and consultants\u2019 services contracts  using quality- and \ncost-based  selection. The Ministry  of Transport and Communications  will  be  the  implementing \nagency for a National Road Safety Action Plan and for the public transport policy review. It will \nbe the focal point for coordination among stakeholders.  \n \nAdditional  financing  may  be  considered  in  the  future  if  the  project  performs  well.  The \n24. \noriginal  loans  will  be  used  to  prepare  designs  and  undertake  safeguards  due  diligence  for  an \nadditional 169 km of national roads. The feasibility assessment and design of the Manatuto to \nNatarbora  subproject  has  been  completed  and  procurement  of  civil  works  and  consultants \nservices is being undertaken in advance.  \n \n25. \nthe project administration manual.18 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nJanuary 2014\u2013December 2019 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  December 2019 \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nConselho de Administracao do Fundo Infraestrutura \nPrime Minister (chair)  \nMinister of Public Works (member) \nMinister of Transport and Communications (member) \nMinister of Finance (member) \nConselho de Administracao do Fundo Infraestrutura \nMPW \nMOTC \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU, Department of Roads Bridges and Flood Control, 12 staff \n\n3 contracts \n2 contracts \n\n$82.0 million \n$8.0 million \n\nCivil works \nNational competitive bidding (financed \nby the Government of Timor-Leste) \nShopping \nQCBS \nQCBS \nICS \nCivil works packages for Manatuto to Natarbora road \nConstruction supervision for Manatuto to Natarbora road \nDetailed design and safeguard due diligence (169 km of national road) \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\n$ 0.5 million \n10 contracts \n56 person-months \n$ 1.8 million \n326 person-months  $ 5.6 million \n$ 0.9 million \n84 person-months \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, km = kilometer, MOTC = Ministry of Transport \nand Communications, MPW = Ministry of Public Works, PMU = project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\n                                                \n18  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nUpgrading  will  include  strengthening  and  widening  from  a  width  of  generally  less  than \n26. \n4.5  meters  to  6  meters.  Climate  resilience  will  be  emphasized  in  subproject  engineering \ndesigns. Vulnerability to damage from severe rainfall, sea level rise, and other potential effects \nof  climate  change  will  be  reduced  through  engineering  countermeasures,  including  ensuring \nsuitably  sized  drainage  structures,  raising  road  levels  in  flood-prone  areas,  and  using \nbioengineering to promote slope stability. \n   \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n27. \nTimor-Leste still exhibits many of the characteristics of an FCAS. Consequently, rates of \nreturn on investments are likely to be lower and associated risks higher as the country seeks to \nreintegrate socially and economically, while ensuring that the benefits of stability and economic \ngrowth  are  inclusive.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  engaging  with  weakly  performing \ncountries,  economic  internal  rates  of  return  in  Timor-Leste  should  not  be  expected  to  be  the \nsame as in other developing member countries (footnote 3). \n \nThe  core  subproject\u2014the  Manatuto  to  Natarbora  road\u2014links  the  north  coast  road  to \n28. \nlarge-scale  development  planned  to  support  the  oil  and  gas  industries  on  the  south  coast. \nBecause the condition of the existing road is poor, all forms of development are suppressed. By \nconsidering only the demand generated by those south coast developments for which there is a \nhigh  level  of  certainty,  a  conservative  approach  to  estimation  of  future  traffic  has  been  taken. \nOther  nonquantifiable  benefits,  such  as  road  safety,  and  improved  access  to  health  and \neducation, have not been included. The economic assessment also does not take into account \nbenefits  such  as  political  stability  and  national  integration,  which  are  potentially  significant. \nBecause of the mountainous terrain, the cost of constructing the road to a standard sufficient to \ncatalyze the development as envisaged is relatively high.19 The economic internal rate of return \nof the preferred option has been calculated to be 10.2%.   \n \nUpgrading of the road while incorporating climate resilience measures  will substantially \n29. \nreduce  future  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  Maintaining  the  unimproved  road  to  a  basic \nserviceable standard is estimated to cost $1.25 million a year, nearly four times the $0.32 million \nfor  upgraded  the  road.  Current  budget  allocations  for  maintenance,  which  include  for \nemergencies,  are  sufficient.  Needs  will  reduce  as  roads  are  upgraded  and  maintenance \npractices improve.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  public  financial  management  system  is  heavily  centralized  with  numerous  controls \n30. \nthat  have  resulted  in  bottlenecks \nthat  slow  payment  processes  and  weaken  budget \nimplementation.  Decentralization  of  noncore  financial  management  functions  from  the  Ministry \nof  Finance  to  line  ministries  has  been  promoted,  as  capacity  within  these  agencies  has \nincreased.  However,  the  system  for  payments  continues  to  involve  a  number  of  agencies  in \nreviewing the payment certificates provided by the PMU and MPW. \n \nThe Procurement Commission was established in 2011. With the assistance of the PMU, \n31. \nthe commission satisfactorily administered bidding processes in 2012 for ADB-financed projects \n                                                \n19 To accommodate container traffic, a minimum 6 meter carriageway with 1 meter shoulders is needed. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. However, the transparency and efficiency of procurement \nstill  needs  improvement,  and  a  balance  between  risk  and  accountability  for  projects  without \ndevelopment partner oversight has not yet been achieved. \n \nThe executing agency, Conselho de Administracao do Fundo Infraestrutura (CAFI),  was \n32. \nestablished in 2011 to oversee the use of the Infrastructure Fund.20 The Civil Service Act (2004) \nprovides standards, principles, definitions, and guidelines for civil service administration; a code \nof ethics for civil servants; and an administrative disciplinary mechanism. A law creating the new \nAnti-Corruption Commission became effective in 2009, and the first anticorruption commissioner \nwas  appointed  in  2010.  However,  the  independence  of  this  commission  needs  to  be  assured \nand it needs to be resourced effectively. \n \nTo  mitigate  the  risks,  the  MPW  has  implemented  a  number  of  ADB-supported \n33. \ninfrastructure projects through the PMUs. A PMU was created within the MPW to administer the \nRoad Network Development Sector Project and was expanded for the Road Network Upgrading \nProject. It will be strengthened to administer this project. The PMU has a financial administrator \nwho  has  considerable  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects.  Based  on  previous  project \nimplementation experience, the PMU has sufficient capacity to manage the project. \n \n34. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \ngovernment  and  the  CAFI.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n35. \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  project  are  (i)  road  users,  including  vehicle  drivers, \npassengers, and/or nonmotorized transport users; (ii) households in communities that sell cash \ncrops and other agricultural produce; (iii)  providers of passenger and goods transport services \nand commercial truck drivers; and (iv) small businesses and traders, including vendors at local \nmarkets,  trade  store  owners,  coffee  and  other  produce  buyers,  and  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises in the district capitals and towns. Key social service providers, such as those in the \neducation and health sectors, will also benefit from road upgrading. \n \n36.  Women  have  been  generally  excluded  from  infrastructure-related  jobs  and  decision \nmaking  related  to  infrastructure  development.  The  project  aims  to  redress  this.  Classified  as \n\u201ceffective gender mainstreaming,\u201d the project is designed to support women\u2019s empowerment by \nconsidering  their  views  and  requirements  in  the  design  of  the  subprojects.  Women\u2019s \ninvolvement  in  all  jobs  under  the  project  will  be  promoted. 21 The  project  will  (i) incorporate \nwomen\u2019s views in the project design; (ii) raise awareness of gender and transport security, and \nHIV/AIDS; (iii) have a quota for women in the construction work, favoring unemployed widows, \nfemale heads  of  households,  and other  vulnerable groups; and (iv)  have  a quota for  women\u2019s \ninvolvement in bioengineering and maintenance works. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory B for resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The improvement of roads \nis  expected  to  be  mostly  within  the  existing  road  corridor,  but  will  require  some  resettlement \n\n                                                \n20 The  Infrastructure  Fund  is  derived  from  the  petroleum  revenue-financed  sovereign  wealth  fund  and  used  for \n\nfinancing infrastructure development. \n\n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\finvolving  small  areas  of  land,  some  houses  and  shops,  and  roadside  stalls  and  kiosks.  A \nresettlement  framework  has  been  prepared,  providing  guidelines  on  screening,  assessment, \nand  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  for  road  subprojects.  A  draft  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen  prepared  for  the  core  subproject.  This  has  been  disclosed,  along  with  the  resettlement \nframework on the government and ADB websites. Resettlement plans for other subprojects will \nbe  prepared  during  implementation  following  the  resettlement  framework.  The  MPW  will \nendorse  and  publicly  disclose  the  resettlement  framework  and  draft  resettlement  plan,  and \ndisseminate relevant information in local languages in subproject areas. \n \n38.  \nThe MPW will finalize the resettlement plan for each subproject after the detailed design \nis prepared, and ensure that affected persons receive compensation following the resettlement \nframework. The MPW will (i) appoint a focal person for land issues; (ii) set up an environmental \nand  social  unit  within  PMU,  including  social  safeguard  specialists;  (iii)  coordinate  with  the \nDepartment of Land, Property and Cadastral Services and other relevant agencies; and (iv) set \nup  national  and  district  committees  to  implement  resettlement  activities.  The  project  will \nstrengthen  the  MPW\u2019s  social  safeguard  capacity  by  providing  resettlement  specialists  (30 \nperson-months) and by conducting training.   \n \n39. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared to ensure that the \nproject  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  Timor-Leste  laws.  An \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) has been prepared for the core subproject based on the \ndetailed design. This has been publicly disclosed, along with the EARF on the government and \nADB websites. IEEs of five candidate subprojects have also been undertaken, and these will be \nupdated  based  on  the  detailed  design.  The  environmental  impacts  of  road  upgrading  works \nduring  construction  and  operation  have  been  assessed,  and  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable \nlevels.  \n \nThe Environmental Management Plan (EMP) from the updated IEE for each subproject \n40. \nwill  be  incorporated  in  civil  works  contracts.  The  EMP  will  guide  the  PMU,  supervision \nconsultants,  and  contractors  in  managing,  monitoring,  and  reporting  environmental  impact \nmitigations and compliance. Civil works will not start until (i) the contractor has received training \non  environmental  management  and  has  submitted  the  site-specific  EMP;  (ii)  the  site-specific \nEMP  has  been  reviewed  and  cleared  by  the  PMU  and  supervision  consultant;  and  (iii)  an \nenvironment  license  has  been  obtained from  the  National  Directorate  for  Environment.  During \nimplementation,  the  environmental  management  capacity  of  the  DRBFC  and  PMU  will  be \nstrengthened through environment specialists who will provide training.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n41.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 22  The  risks  can  be  managed  and  are \nmitigated  by  the  design  of  the  project.  The  intended  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nLand acquisition delays the \nstart of civil works. \nDifficult environment (high \nrainfall and unstable terrain)  \nMPW in-house capacity for \ntechnical guidance and \nsupervision is weak. \nCorruption \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nResettlement plans will be finalized and compensation will be paid before \ncivil works begin.
