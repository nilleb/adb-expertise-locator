First, it is substantially cheaper to run trains on electric traction compared with diesel-\npowered trains. Despite carrying 65.4% of all freight and 51.2% of the passenger load of Indian \nRailways, electric traction accounts for only 36% of the total energy bill, with diesel accounting for \nthe balance 64%. Second, electric traction is not dependent on a specific primary source of energy \n(in contrast to diesel) and can therefore be sourced from a range of energy forms taking price and \nother characteristics into consideration, such as increasing renewable energy capacity in India. \nThird,  electric  traction  makes  regenerative  braking  possible,  where  energy  is  recovered  from \nbraking or slowing down of the train and thereby saving energy by up to 20%.2 Finally, it reduces \ndependence on imported energy (diesel), thereby helping manage the current account deficit, and \nremoves variability  of  input  energy  prices  which  are  dependent  on  international  crude  oil  price \nmovements.  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s  20-year  loan  will  allow  IRFC  to  match  the  cash  flows  from  the \nassets to loan repayment with no foreign exchange risk.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n3. \nThe Government of India has placed significant emphasis on investing in infrastructure, \nand has developed a 5-year, $132 billion capital expenditure program for the modernization of \nIndian Railways, which it owns through the Ministry of Railways (MOR). The program comprises \nof  network  expansion  and  decongestion,  enhancement  of  safety  and  passenger  amenities, \ndevelopment  of  dedicated  freight  corridors,  station  redevelopment,  and  procurement  of  rolling \nstock and other related assets. The electrification of railway tracks is part of this overall master \nplan, which is critical for the movement of goods and people within the country. Indian Railways \nlaunched Mission Electrification in November 2016 under the guidance of MOR, and has set an \nelectrification  target  of  38,000  route  km  by  FY2022.3  With  a  substantial  part  of  its  network \nelectrified,  Indian  Railways  is  expected  to  achieve  cumulative  savings  of  \u20b9260  billion  over  a \ndecade because of reduced diesel bills from FY2021 onwards.4 \n \n4. \nIndian Railways is the third largest railway network in the world, comprising over 121,407 \nkm of total track length and a total route length5 of 67,368 km as of 31 March 2017.6 In FY2017, \nIndian Railways carried over 8.2 billion passengers and 1.1 billion tons of freight. As of 31 March \n2017, 25,367 route km were electrified out of the total 61,680 route km of broad-gauge network.6  \n \n\n                                                \n1  Government of India, Ministry of Railways. 2017.

New Delhi. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nExisting sources of funds for Indian Railways include internal cash generation, sovereign-\n5. \nbacked loans from multilateral and bilateral agencies, budgetary support from the government, \njoint ventures with other state-owned enterprises, resource mobilization by undertaking public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships,  commercial  borrowings  from  banks,  financial  institutions,  and  capital \nmarkets. In its effort to mobilize funding from a new avenue, MOR, through IRFC (its fully owned \nand captive financing vehicle), has approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider \na nonsovereign loan to meet a part of the funding requirements for railway track electrification. \nThe proposed financing, aimed at supporting key infrastructure development, represents a unique \nopportunity  for  ADB  to  engage  with  a  commercially  viable  and  professionally  managed  state-\nowned enterprise, which has embarked upon a highly ambitious fund-raising plan to support the \ngovernment\u2019s railway modernization aspirations. To ensure success of this initiative, IRFC needs \nto  explore  all  possible  sources  of  long-term  financing,  including  from  multilateral  development \nbanks. ADB will play a critical role in funding this capital expenditure program. \n \n\nProject Design \n\n2. \n \nPayment structure: The figure below shows the payment structure for the project. ADB \n6. \nwill enter into a facility agreement with IRFC. IRFC (the owner of the assets financed by the ADB \nloan) will be entering into a lease agreement with MOR. In addition, ADB, IRFC, and MOR will be \nentering  into  a  substitution  agreement.  ADB  will  have substitution rights under the  substitution \nagreement,  which  will  enable  it  to  replace  IRFC  with  a  nominated  company  in  case  of  its \nnonperformance.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n7. \nProject implementation. For electrification, MOR currently relies on in-house agencies: \nCentral Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE), Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, and railways \nzonal  offices,  which  historically  have  undertaken  the  track  electrification  work.  To  achieve  the \nelectrification target, MOR has increased the number of agencies executing electrification projects \nfrom the existing 3 to 6 by entrusting works to new agencies\u2014the Indian Railway Construction \nCompany Limited, Rail India Techno Economic Service Limited, and the Power Grid Corporation \nof India Limited. CORE was set up in 1979 and since then has been the key executing agency for \nrailway electrification, having electrified 22,522 route km of tracks.7 For the railway tracks to be \nelectrified under the ADB project, CORE would be the implementing agency. \n \n8. \nExecution  and  monitoring  strategy.  MOR  has  allocated  sections  of  the  track  to  the \nimplementing agency based on its capacity to implement. Since CORE is the most experienced \nand largest agency, it has secured most of the work, followed by other agencies. CORE and other \nimplementing  agencies  have  been  advised  by  MOR  to  implement  electrification  on  an \nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) basis. The selection of the contractor is based \non the contractor\u2019s technical and financial capacity. The EPC contracts awarded are typically lump \nsum, turnkey contracts. EPC contracts follow open tendering and are awarded after completion \nof  the  predevelopment  work  such  as  acquisition  of  land  (if  required),  procurement  of  various \nconsents  and  permits,  and  completion  of  design  and  technical  specifications.  The  technical \nspecifications are provided by the Research Designs and Standards Organisation, which is the \nresearch  arm  of  Indian  Railways.  Monitoring  of  the  construction  activity  is  undertaken  by  an \nindependent technical firm and an authorized representative of CORE. \n \n\n                                                \n7  Central Organisation for Railway Electrification. 2017.

The  project  also \ninvolves  construction  of  traction  substations  and  the  installation  of  electricity  poles  along  the \nrailway track.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n10. \nLocation, land, and project details. A long list of electrification subprojects (sections) is \ncurrently under consideration. These sections are located in 13 states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, \nBihar,  Chhattisgarh,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  Jharkhand,  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa, \nRajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  Two  subprojects\u2014Rohtak\u2013Panipat  (location: \nHaryana,  length:  71  route  km,  cost:  \u20b9713  million)  and  Ranchi\u2013Lohardaga\u2013Tori  (location: \nJharkhand,  length:  116  route  km,  cost:  \u20b91,050  million)\u2014have  been  selected  for  the  initial \nsafeguards due diligence, and the due diligence has been completed. Other sections to be funded \nunder the project will be selected from this long list based on a pre-agreed set of screening and \ndue diligence criteria to arrive at approximately 3,378 route km of subprojects. Land required for \nthe traction overhead equipment is owned by Indian Railways and additional land acquisition is \nnot  envisaged.  However,  transmission  lines  from  the  nearest  feeder  substation  to  the  track \nsubstation  will  involve  right-of-way  acquisitions.  As  confirmed  by  CORE,  the  transmission  line \nworks  from  feeder  substations  to  track  substations  are  executed  by  the  respective  state \ntransmission utility. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nFinancing  strategy.  Based  on  the  average  cost  of  electrification  per  route  km,  it  is \n11. \nestimated that the $750 million of the ADB loan can finance the electrification of approximately \n3,378 route km of existing railway tracks. Debt financing is being structured as a standard secured \nproject finance loan for a tenor of 20 years. \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrower and Sponsors \n\n \n12. \nBorrower. IRFC was set up in 1986 as the dedicated financing arm of Indian Railways for \nmobilizing  funds  from  domestic  and  international  capital  markets.  It  is  fully  owned  by  the \ngovernment and is registered as a nonbanking finance company. IRFC\u2019s principal business is to \nraise funds from the financial markets to finance the acquisition or creation of assets which are \nthen leased out to MOR. IRFC is rated BBB\u2013 by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Baa2 by \nMoody\u2019s Investors Service, which are at par with India\u2019s sovereign rating, and AAA by all three \ndomestic rating agencies (Crisil, ICRA, and CARE). \n \n13. \n \n\nBorrower financials.

Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nImpact.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  Indian  Railways\u2019  goals  of  (i) \nproviding an efficient, affordable, customer-focused, and environmentally sustainable integrated \ntransportation  solution;  and  (ii)  securing  at  least  10%  of  its  total  energy  requirements  from \nrenewable energy sources such as solar and wind power and biomass by 2020, apart from using \nelectricity from the national grid, which also has a component of clean and renewable energy.10 \nFollowing ADB guidelines to calculate climate change mitigation from projects of this nature, and \ngiven the high grid emission factor of the current Indian electricity grid, no net emission reductions \nfrom the project can be identified at this stage.  However, a significant shift towards renewable \nenergy  is  expected  in the Indian grid mix  in  coming  years.  Moreover, the  Indian  Railways  has \nitself made strong commitments to directly source electricity from renewable sources. These two \ndevelopments will contribute to climate change mitigation benefits from the project in the future, \nalthough it is not possible to quantify such benefits at this stage. \n \n17. \nand cargo transported by electric traction on the additionally electrified tracks. \n \n18. \nOutput. The output of the project is that 3,378 km of railway routes are electrified. The \nwork  related  to  the  electrification  will  also  generate  employment  for  the  local  community  and \nstimulate the local and national economy. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure, one of ADB\u2019s five core operational areas, which are based on ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nand  reaffirmed  through  its  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.11  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2018\u20132022  for  India  is  based  on  three  development  pillars:  (i)  boosting  economic \ncompetitiveness to create more and better jobs, (ii) inclusive provision of infrastructure networks \nand services, and (iii) addressing climate change and increasing climate resilience.12 The project \nparticularly supports pillars (i) and (ii). \n \n20. \nConsistency  with  sector  initiative  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  which  defines  a  sustainable  transport \n\nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: Increased number of passengers \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n                                                \n8  Government  of  India,  Indian  Railways.  2018.

In 2011, ADB approved a $500 million multitranche financing facility \nfor the Railway Sector Investment Program.14 Part of tranche 1 within the multitranche financing \nfacility  was  used  towards  electrification  of  640  km  of  railway  tracks.  Lessons  learnt  from  the \nimplementation  of  the  multitranche  financing  facility  have  been  considered  in  designing  this \nproject. One of the key lessons learnt was that the project implementation gets delayed due to \nland acquisition issues. This lesson has been incorporated in the project design. Initial selection \nof the subprojects will be undertaken to minimize land acquisition, and payment under the lease \nagreement will start on a pre-specified date irrespective of the subproject construction progress.  \n \nD. \n \n21. \n \n22. \n \nE. \n \n23. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.15 \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nImplementation period \n\nArrangements \nIndian Railways initiated the Mission Electrification program with the intention to electrify \n38,000  route  km  by  FY2022.  The  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  regulates  the  track \nelectrification and has entrusted the following government entities to achieve the target \nset  by  Indian  Railways:  Central  Organisation  for  Railway  Electrification,  Rail  Vikas \nNigam  Limited,  Indian  Railway  Construction  Company,  Rail  India  Techno  Economic \nService Limited, Power Grid Corporation, and Indian Railways zonal offices. \nThe track electrification work for the project has commenced and will be completed in \nsections. EPC contractors for one of the sections (in Jharkhand) have been appointed. \nBids  for  the  other  sections  will  progressively  be  called.

The 20-year tenor comprises of a 4-year availability period and a 16-year \nrepayment period. Customary project finance security package will be available to ADB. \n \nA proposed technical assistance (TA) grant to Indian Railways, with CORE acting as the \n26. \nimplementing agency is being separately processed for ADB internal approval. This TA will help \nbuild capacities on environmental and social safeguards systems required for implementing the \nproposed railway electrification subprojects. The TA support will include deployment of a team of \nconsultants  to  assist  the  corporate  and  subproject  teams  of  CORE  in  implementing  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards provisions. Through the establishment of an environmental and social management \nsystem  and  procedures,  the  TA  will  strengthen  CORE\u2019s  position  as  a  safeguards-compliant \norganization with adequate capacities to mitigate and manage environmental and social impacts \nin its railways electrification program. The TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months. \n \nB. \n \n27. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nThe value additions of ADB\u2019s assistance are as follows: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nADB  is  providing  a  20-year  amortizing  local  currency  loan.  Structuring  the \ntransaction in this manner allows IRFC to match the cash flows from the assets to \nloan repayment with no foreign exchange risk.  \nits  ongoing \nThe  aggregate  funding  requirements  of  Indian  Railways  for \nmodernization  program  is  immense\u2014about  $132  billion.  ADB\u2019s  participation  will \nhelp  crowd-in  private  sector  insurance  companies  by  way  of  unfunded  risk \ntransfers, which is an important and new source of mobilization. The precedent set \nthrough this transaction will encourage other private sector institutions to provide \nfinancing to IRFC for its project pipeline. \nADB's  TA  will  help  Indian  Railways  enhance  its  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  evaluation  and  monitoring  systems.  This  will  help  Indian  Railways \nachieve  the  international  norms  for  safeguard  compliance,  thus  improving  its \naccess to various other international funding sources. \n \n\nRisks \n\nLease agreement framework.

An  environmental  compliance  audit  was  additionally \nundertaken as part of the initial environmental examination for ongoing construction projects of \nthe Ranchi\u2013Tori section. Safeguard documents for other subprojects will be prepared by CORE, \non behalf of IRFC, prior to disbursement, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction, and in line with ADB\u2019s safeguard \nframeworks. Subprojects categorized A for any of the three safeguard categories will not be taken \nup for ADB funding. The institutional capacity and commitment of IRFC and CORE to manage \nthe project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n35. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  track  electrification \nsubprojects are generally site specific, reversible, and mostly caused by associated construction \nactivities.  These  impacts  typically  include  land  and  vegetation  clearing  for  site  preparation, \ntransportation and delivery of equipment and materials, and excavation and laying of foundations \nfor  electricity  poles  and  transmission  towers.  Issues  may  potentially  include  occupational  and \ncommunity  health  and  safety  during  the  construction  phase,  which  includes  short-term  and \nlocalized generation of dust, air emission, noise, wastes, soil erosion, and water pollution. There \nare  no  protected  areas  or  environmentally  sensitive  areas  along  these  two  corridors.  The \ntransmission  lines  will  be  aligned  through  agricultural  or  government  land  avoiding  residential \nareas or lands, and any impacts on forests or water bodies. Recommended mitigation measures \nto address the project environmental impacts are presented in the environmental management \nplan  and  will  be  monitored.  IRFC  through  CORE  commits  to  implement  the  corrective  actions \n                                                \n16 India\u2019s sovereign rating is upgraded by Moody\u2019s from Baa3 to Baa2, with outlook changed from positive to stable. \n17  Sources: (i) S&P Global Ratings.

The framework is outlined in the linked document. \n\n\f8 \n \n\nidentified  in  the  environmental  audit  to  address  the  improvements  to  occupational  health  and \nsafety  practices  during  construction  of  the  Ranchi\u2013Tori  section.  The  respective  state  power \ntransmission agencies will implement the transmission lines. \n \nSocial safeguards. The railways electrification will be carried out along the existing tracks \n36. \nwithin  land  owned  by  Indian  Railways  and  is  unlikely  to  result  in  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement impacts. New facilities such as traction substations and sectioning and paralleling \nposts will be located on railway land. No permanent land acquisition will be carried out for the \ntransmission line alignments. These alignments will be finalized to avoid impacts on structures \nand permanent assets and minimize impacts on agricultural land. Compensation for temporary \ndamage to crops and trees will be paid at replacement costs to the landowners. In addition, IRFC, \nthrough CORE and the state power transmission agencies, commits to implement the guidelines \nof the Ministry of Power of the Government of India to compensate 85% of the land value for the \nfootprint of the transmission towers and 15% of the land value for the corridor impacted  by the \nstringing of the transmission lines. A section of the 8.8 km transmission line for the Ranchi\u2013Tori \nsubproject passes through scheduled areas occupied by tribal groups. The impacts will be limited \nto  temporary  crop  damage  during  construction.  Preliminary  consultations  along  the  tentative \nalignments indicate that the lands are privately owned without any traditional or customary rights. \nUpon finalization of the alignment, vulnerability assessment of the households will be carried out \nand provisions of the safeguard frameworks will be applied. \n \n37. \nSocial  dimensions.  IRFC,  through  CORE,  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and, \npursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.19  IRFC,  with  inputs  from  CORE,  will  report \nregularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures \ntaken.  IRFC,  through  CORE,  is  committed  to  incorporate  provisions  in  subproject  contract \nagreements that provide for equal opportunities and support non-discrimination of women in the \nemployment  opportunities  generated.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  no  gender  elements. \nInformation  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  will  be  conducted  in  accordance \nwith ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n \n38. \nIRFC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n39. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),20 \n40. \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India \nhas  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  IRFC.
