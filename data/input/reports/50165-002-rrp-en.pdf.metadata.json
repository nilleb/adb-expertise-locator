It will also develop common infrastructure \non about 66 hectares (ha) of new urban land to enable the safe and sustainable expansion of \nhuman  settlements  and  commercial  activities.  Finally,  it  will  support  capacity  development  to \nimprove flood risk management and the delivery of urban services.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nBhutan,  which  is  located  entirely  within  the  Himalayan  mountain  range,  is  increasingly \n3. \nexperiencing  water-induced  disasters  such  as  landslides,  floods,  and  flash  floods.  Major  cities \nsuch  as  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Paro  are  encroaching  on  scarce  agricultural  land  and \nunsafe  terrain,  including  steep  hillsides  and  floodplains.  This  situation,  coupled  with  rapid \nurbanization,  is  making  it  extremely  difficult  for  Bhutan  to  achieve  its  vision  of  balanced  and \nenvironmentally sustainable development. \n \n4. \nAn important focus of Bhutan\u2019s development strategy is the potential of growth centers in \nthe south near the Indian border to boost export-oriented industrial development. The advantages \nof these centers compared to others elsewhere in the country include better access to transport, \ncheaper  wage  labor  from  India,  access  to  cheaper  raw  materials,  and  an  abundant  and \ninexpensive power supply.2 Under its Economic Development Policy, 2010, Bhutan is prioritizing \ninfrastructure  investments  and  improved  connectivity  to  stimulate  the  development  of  these \ncenters as economic hubs for trade, transport, storage, and manufacturing.3 However, the centers \nare constrained by a dearth of adequate and suitable land for development. \n \nBhutan\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan,  2014\u20132018  identified  Phuentsholing  as  a  regional \n5. \ngrowth center that can be safely expanded through the construction of flood protection works and \nplanned  urbanization.4 Located  on  two  major  trade  corridors  developed  under  the  South  Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  framework,  Phuentsholing  handles  over  80%  of  Bhutan\u2019s \ntrade, and is the country\u2019s largest commercial and industrial hub and main trading gateway with \nIndia. Phuentsholing is also Bhutan\u2019s second most populous city, with 25,000 residents, and is \nanticipated  to  grow  by  5%  per  year  subject  to  land  availability.  Due  to  housing  constraints  in \nPhuentsholing, many Bhutanese people reside on the Indian side of the border in Jaigaon.5  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Amochhu Land \nDevelopment and Township Project (TA 9140-BHU), of which the Phuentsholing Township Development Project will \ndevelop  the  first  66  ha  of  460  ha  that  are  ultimately  planned.  The  government  requested  the  project\u2019s  name  be \nchanged to Phuentsholing Township Development Project following loan negotiations.  \n\n2   ADB. 2013.

Phuentsholing receives more inward migration from rural areas than any other city in Bhutan.  \n\n \n\n\f \n6. \nLand scarcity is a key growth constraint for Phuentsholing, which is physically confined by \nsteep and unstable Himalayan foothills, the Amochhu River, and international borders. The city is \nsignificantly  exposed  to  precipitation-  and  earthquake-triggered  landslides,  which  have  a  high \nmortality rate, and has also been significantly impacted by flood damage and riverbank erosion \nover  the  past  25  years.  Flash  floods  triggered  by  monsoon  rains  are  also  occurring  more \nfrequently  due  to  dense  development,  the  loss  of  natural  ground  cover,  and  climate  change.6 \nSince  2002,  the  Government  of  Bhutan  has  been  working  to  mitigate  Phuentsholing\u2019s  land \nconstraints  and  exposure  to  geophysical  and  flood  hazards  by  constructing  flood  and  erosion \ndefenses along the left and right banks of the Amochhu River, and expanding the city away from \nthe mountain slopes to areas of flat riparian land suitable for residential, commercial, institutional, \nand recreational uses.7  \n \n7. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported Phuentsholing\u2019s development through \n(i)  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Road  Connectivity  Project;8 (ii)  various \nurban  infrastructure  initiatives  under  three  separate  investment  projects;9 and  (iii)  a  transport, \ntrade facilitation,  and  logistics  project.10 These  investments  aim to  enhance  trade,  productivity, \nand connectivity in the region, but do not address land and housing constraints or quality of life. \nThe project will complement and leverage these investments to provide an incubator for economic \ngrowth. Specifically, it will develop about 66 ha of vacant riparian land immediately adjacent to \nthe existing city along the left bank of the Amochhu River, based on the Amochhu Development \nMaster  Plan.11 The  project  will  also  (i)  construct  river  walls  and  common  urban  infrastructure, \n(ii) raise land, (iii) install a flood early warning system, (iv) implement a flood management plan, \nand (v) help the government prepare subsequent phases of development. \n \n8. \nBeyond  infrastructure  investments,  the  project  will  help  Bhutan  improve  its  urban  land \nmanagement  and  municipal  service  delivery.  Like  many  other  local  governments,  which  are \nsimilarly  under-resourced,  the  Phuentsholing  municipality  currently  lacks  the  capacity  to \nimplement and operate the project. Therefore, the project will help the municipal government build \nthis capacity. Meanwhile, the government has entrusted the project\u2019s development and operation \nto Druk Holding and Investments Limited (DHI), a fully government-owned enterprise responsible \nfor  Bhutan\u2019s  strategic \nthe  Construction \nDevelopment Corporation Limited (CDCL).12 Under this project, DHI and the CDCL are applying \n                                                 \n6   The most devastating event in recent history was Cyclone Alia, which caused loss of land and infrastructure when it \n\nincome-generating  entities,  and \n\nits  subsidiary \n\noccurred in 2009. \n\n7   Government of Bhutan. 2004.

The project will also \nbuild the capacity of both the new township office and Phuentsholing municipality to ensure that \ncoordination and high service standards are achieved.  \n \n9. \nThe project is expected to provide opportunities for investment, create jobs, and relieve \nexisting  housing  pressures.  Integrated  planning  and  infrastructure,  and  strengthening  DHI \ninstitutionally  will  ensure  the  sustainability  of  investments  in  a  climate-  and  disaster-resilient \ntownship. The project\u2019s commercial approach, support for investor outreach, and strong focus on \nO&M will ensure the new township\u2019s financial and operational sustainability. Moreover, expanding \nthe municipality\u2019s tax base will help it finance its own investments and operations.  \n \n10. \nLessons. The project design incorporates lessons from disaster risk reduction initiatives \nand  recent  greenfield  urban  development  projects  within  Bhutan  and  the  South  Asian  region. \nLessons  are  incorporated  primarily  from  (i)  ADB\u2019s  recently  completed  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment  project,  which  supported  the  planned  southern  expansion  of  Thimphu  through  a \nparticipatory  process;  and  (ii)  riverfront  development  projects  in  India,  such  as  Naya  Raipur \n(Chhattisgarh),  Sabarmati  (Ahmedabad),  and  Lavasa  (Maharashtra).  Most  notably,  the  project \nwill incorporate the following lessons: (i) construct strong flood and erosion defenses that account \nfor  climate  change  projections,  install    flood  early  warning  systems,  and  establish  community-\nbased flood management procedures; (ii) phase capital expenditure in line with planned growth \ninstead of completing all components upfront, and develop land incrementally; and (iii) ensure a \nrobust  institutional  arrangement  for  O&M,  including  the  application  of  build\u2013operate  works \npackages. Positive lessons from other projects in Bhutan (footnote 9) have been applied to the \nproject\u2019s urban components, such as the successful expansion of Thimphu to accommodate an \nadditional  19,000  people  (about  16%  of  the  city\u2019s  population)  in  livable  urban  environments \nwithout encroaching into hazardous areas. \n \n11. \nValue added by ADB\u2019s assistance. During preparation, ADB has helped the government \nincorporate  in  the  township  master  plan  integrated  urban  planning  principles  that  address  the \nsocial,  economic,  environmental,  and  physical  aspects  of \ntownship.  During \ntownship  and \nimplementation,  ADB  will  (i)  streamline  coordination  between \nPhuentsholing  municipality  to  enhance  service  delivery,  connectivity,  and  linkages  with  the \nexisting  city  and  ongoing  and  future  multisector  ADB  projects;  (ii)  develop  a  sustainable  and \neffective  model  for  township  management;  (iii)  ensure  sustainability  by  embedding  the  project \nwithin  longer  term  strategic  plans  for  the  wider  economic  area;  and  (iv)  ensure  that  strong \nmarketing  machinery  is  in  place  to  attract  investors.  The  project  will  improve  the  capacity  and \ncompetitiveness  of  the  Phuentsholing  urban  area  and  complement  the  efforts  of  the  ADB-\nsupported South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program, which has enabled greater \nconnectivity and facilitated trade between Bhutan and other countries in the region. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  balanced  and  sustainable \n12. \ndevelopment of human settlements ensured (footnote 4); and (ii) smart growth principles applied \nin planning and development to promote Phuentsholing\u2019s cultural and social vibrancy (footnote 5). \nThe project will have the following outcome: Phuentsholing\u2019s urban area protected from floods \nand expanded with improved amenities and services.13 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nthe  new \n\nthe  new \n\n                                                 \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Flood and erosion protection measures installed. The riverbank protection \nworks  will  protect  Phuentsholing  from  flooding  and  erosion.  Specifically,  the  project  will \n(i) construct  4  kilometers  of  erosion-resilient  river  walls  to  protect  against  a  100-year  probable \nflood, (ii) raise ground levels behind the new walls to reclaim at least 66 ha of flood-protected land \nfor urban development, and (iii) establish and operationalize a flood early warning system and \nflood management plan in consultation with the community. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Municipal infrastructure constructed. The project will provide serviced plots \nof land by constructing common urban infrastructure comprising (i) about 10 kilometers of roads \nwith  footpaths,  landscaping,  and  streetlights,  which  are  planned  in  consultation  with  women; \n(ii) modern  drinking  water  supply  and  distribution  systems,  and  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment systems that service the new township and adjoining areas; (iii) a resource recovery \nsystem for managing solid waste in both the new and old townships; and (iv) power distribution \nand  telecommunication  systems  throughout  the  new  township.  The  plots  will  be  leased  to \nresidential and commercial investors as prescribed by the Amochhu Development Master Plan, \nwhich emphasizes principles of sustainable urban design such as maximum walkability, greenery, \nand open spaces. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Township management systems installed. The project will (i) establish asset \nmanagement systems, (ii) build the capacity of township staff to ensure sustainable and effective \nurban management, and (iii) initiate investor promotion activities. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $63  million  (Table  1).

Two \nwidely  accepted  methods\u2014flood  frequency  analysis  and  synthetic  unit  hydrograph  analysis\u2014\nwere  used  to  derive  the  design flood  estimate for  the  Amochhu  River  at  Phuentsholing.  Flood \nevents were simulated using one- and two-dimensional computer models, with sensitivity testing \nof  various  parameters  to  confirm  the  designs.  Physical  modelling  of  the  ultimate  development \nscenario  will  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation.  The  walls  have  a  100-year  flood \ndesign  standard  and  1-meter  freeboard  between  the  design  flood  levels  and  building  platform \nlevels. This is a normal standard of protection for urban areas adjacent to major rivers. The impact \nof climate change on future flood magnitudes may reduce the freeboard by up to 33%, which is \nacceptable. Cross-drainage structures have been designed to convey 50-year floods from local \ncatchments,  including  an  allowance  for  climate  change.  The  foundation  design  of  the  walls \naccounts  for  scour,  and  any  accumulation  of  sedimentation  will  be  managed  during  O&M. \nAdditional erosion control measures, such as installation of spurs, will be considered using the \nphysical model. A flood early warning system and management plan will be established under the \nproject to ensure residents\u2019 safety during all flood events. \n \n22. \nUrban planning and municipal infrastructure. An urban master plan and development \ncontrol regulations was prepared for the new urban area and is consistent with the project\u2019s vision \nand  appropriate  for  the  country\u2019s  context.  The  plan  and  regulations  will  ensure  that  the  new \ntownship is livable, vibrant, inclusive, affordable, sustainable, and safe. The plan and regulations \nalso guided the design of common urban infrastructure to be installed under the project, including \nlocal roads, drainage, footpaths, parks, treated water supply and distribution systems, sewerage \ncollection  and  treatment  systems,  telecommunication  facilities,  and  electricity  distribution \nsystems. The works contract for constructing the common urban infrastructure will include 5 years \nof O&M to augment the CDCL\u2019s capacity to operate the new township while transferring skills. \nThe  designs  incorporate  hard  and  soft  linkages  with  the  existing  city.  For  example,  the  water \nsupply and sewerage treatment systems will service existing built up areas adjacent to the new \ntownship, solid waste management facilities will be shared, and traffic management studies are \nplanned to mitigate or avoid traffic congestion. \n \n23. \nSustainable  township  management  systems.  The  project  will  establish  a  township \nmanagement  office  within  the  project  area  and  will  strengthen  the  CDCL\u2019s  ability  to  manage, \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\noperate,  and  maintain  the  new  township  effectively  and  sustainably.  This  includes  installing \nsupervisory control and data acquisition technology to operate the water supply and sanitation \nfacilities,  and  introducing  modern  asset  management,  customer  service,  and  financial \nmanagement  systems.  The  project  will  also  help  market  the  new  township  to  potential \ninternational  and  national  commercial  investors,  and  provide  transaction  advisory  services. \nCapacity-building activities will benefit both new township and Phuentsholing municipality staff. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic  analysis.  Increased  land  value  accounts  for  about  76%  of  total  project \nbenefits,  with  reduced  flood  damage  to  infrastructure  and  increased  benefits  from  water  and \npower supply accounting for the remaining 24%. Given several uncertainties related to the project, \na risk modeling framework was used to estimate the value of the project benefits. The economic \nanalysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with a mean economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) of 11.3%. The project\u2019s economic feasibility is not sensitive to unfavorable changes \nin investment costs and economic benefits; the EIRR only drops below the economic opportunity \ncost  of  capital  of  9%  if  investment  costs  increase  by  30%  or  benefits  decrease  by  22%.  The \nproject\u2019s EIRR is far less sensitive to changes in management and O&M costs. The poverty impact \nratio was estimated at 5.2%. It is assumed that occupants of residential housing\u2014including social \nhousing reserved for the poor\u2014will value the new land they occupy at higher lease rates than \nwould be payable to the government, primarily because the quality of urban infrastructure and \nservices will be much better than can be found elsewhere in Bhutan. \n \n25. \nFinancial analysis. The project\u2019s financial sustainability was assessed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). The project\u2019s \ncash inflows mainly comprise revenues generated from the lease of newly developed land, which \nthe government will promote to investors with new financial and regulatory incentives. Revenue \nwill  also  include  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste  management  service \ncharges.  Although  the  project  will  not  fully  recover  its  capital  costs,  it  will  generate  enough \ncashflow to pay for O&M and its debt service obligations, since a portion of the capital costs is \ngrant-financed. Expected financial internal rate of return of 4.3% is slightly lower than the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4.5%, mainly due to the opportunity cost of ADB grants. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment of DHI and the CDCL was \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of \nProjects.15 The project\u2019s overall risk assessment is low. The CDCL will assign a suitably qualified \nfull-time project accountant to be trained in ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. Further, the Royal \nAudit  Authority  of  Bhutan,  an  independent  and  nonpartisan  institution  authorized  to  audit \ngovernment  agencies,  will  audit  the  CDCL\u2019s  financial  statements  annually  in  accordance  with \ninternational  auditing  standards.  An  integrity  due  diligence  of  DHI  and  the  CDCL  yielded \nsatisfactory results. \n \nProcurement.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \n27. \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and all consultants will be recruited following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nA procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  the  project\u2019s  overall  procurement  risk  is \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n15  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fflooding  experienced  by \n\nThe  erosion  and  annual \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nmoderate.16 Procurement specialists will help the CDCL prepare and evaluate bids. Funds will be \nallocated under the project to provide procurement training to the implementing agency and local \ncontractors. \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n28. \nto and discussed with the government, DHI, and the CDCL. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  14).  The  Anti-Corruption \nCommission of Bhutan, the constitutional anticorruption agency, is empowered to investigate any \nproject irregularities. The CDCL will follow government rules and procedures for all expenses and \nrevenue items, and will establish both a project website to ensure transparency and a system for \nhandling complaints related to contracts and procurement. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nthe  existing  municipality \ndisproportionately  affects  the  poor,  who  lack  the  resources  to  cope  and  recover  quickly.  By \naddressing this problem, the project is expected to boost the economy, create more and better \nemployment  opportunities  in  the  longer  term,  and  help  alleviate  poverty.  Moreover,  adding \nhousing  stock  to  the  new  township  will  relieve  pressure  in  the  existing  municipality  by  making \nhousing more affordable. Therefore, the project will directly benefit vulnerable local inhabitants in \nseveral ways. The second project output includes the development of recreation areas, pedestrian \nsafety features such as streetlights, public toilets, road markings, ramps, and footpaths. Women \nand  women\u2019s  organizations  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  public  planning  meetings \nassociated with the project, especially those related to the development of municipal infrastructure \nand  the  flood  early  warning  system.  The  civil  works  contracts  will  include  labor  provisions  to \nensure  that  women  and  men  receive  equal  pay  for  equal  work,  and  that  HIV  awareness \ncampaigns are conducted for laborers and local communities. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy has been prepared.17 \n \nE. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.18 \n \n31. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  significant \nenvironmental impact. However, due to its location on Bhutan\u2019s border with India and upstream \nof  India\u2019s  Jadalpara  National  Park,  the  project  has  been  classified  as  category  A  for  the \nenvironment, and an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study was prepared.19 The EIA\u2019s \nscope covers the full extent of the government\u2019s ultimate plan to develop 460 ha of new urban \nland  along  both  banks  of  the  Amochhu  River  under  their  Amochhu  Land  Development  and \nTownship Project, although the current project area is limited to 66 ha on the left bank. The EIA \nfound that most impacts occur during construction due to river bed levelling, the transportation of \nconstruction materials and equipment, and the construction of urban facilities. These impacts are \ntemporary, local, and reversible. Mitigation measures have been proposed, and an environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  has  been  prepared  and  will  be  strictly  implemented  throughout  the \nconstruction  period.  Nonetheless,  the  project  may  impact  aquatic  ecology  due  to  river  bed \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n16  Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  ADB.

The  EMP  includes  a  mitigation  measure  to  avoid \nspecies disruption by maintaining some natural river flows during the river bed levelling activities; \nif environmental monitoring finds a decline in any important fish species, replenishment will be \nundertaken. The EIA also confirmed that elephants occasionally roam along the right bank. The \nproject will finance a more detailed study of elephant behavior and movement patterns to develop \nappropriate mitigation measures to reduce impacts on their habitat if the right bank is eventually \ndeveloped. During the EIA\u2019s preparation, two public consultations were carried out and the study \nfindings were disclosed. The EIA report was disclosed through ADB\u2019s website on 29 May 2017.20 \n \n32. \nThe implementing agency has adequate capacity to manage the potential impacts. The \nenvironmental officer will be responsible for addressing overall environmental concerns related to \nthe project. The project implementation unit will oversee the overall implementation of the EIA\u2019s \nrecommendations  and  the  EMP,  and  will  be  assisted  by  the  environment  specialist  under  the \nproject  implementation  consultants.  The  contractors  will  have  an  environment  and  safeguard \nspecialist who will manage environmental impacts related to construction. The project will also \nengage  an  external  monitoring  expert  to  monitor  compliance  with  environmental  safeguards \nindependently. The project grievance redress mechanism will be used to resolve complaints in a \ntimely and systematic manner. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). As the entire 66 ha \narea to be developed for flood defenses and the new township is under government control, no \nhouseholds  face  resettlement,  and  no  private  structures  will  be  affected.  A  poverty  and  social \nassessment  found  no  indigenous  people,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement, \nliving near or affected by the project. \n \nF. \n \n34. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nLower than expected demand for \nleasable land \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nThe grant financing will be on-granted to DHI, and favorable \non-lending terms will apply to the loan financing amount. \nThese measures will enable DHI to offer competitive lease \nrates. The project also will appoint a reputable firm to help \nDHI attract investors and provide transaction advisory \nservices. \nThere are no plausible mitigation measures to manage \ndisasters triggered by natural hazards that may prevent or \ndelay implementation. Otherwise, delays in the project are not \nexpected, and at least 30% of packages are expected to be \nunder contracting before the ADB Board consideration date. \n\nDisasters triggered by natural hazards \nand extreme weather conditions lead \nto implementation delays. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DHI = Druk Holding and Investments Limited. \nSource: ADB. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n20 Amochhu Land Development and Township Project: Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government, DHI, and the CDCL have assured ADB that implementation of the project \n35. \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM, loan, and grant documents. \n \n36. \nproject, which are set forth in the draft loan, grant, and project agreements.  \n \n\nThe government, DHI, and the CDCL have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n37. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan of $28,740,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Phuentsholing Township \nDevelopment  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  concessional \nterms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period \nand 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board; \nand \nthe grant not exceeding $24,260,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund),  for  the  Phuentsholing  Township \nDevelopment Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant  and  project  agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n14 May 2018 \n\nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f Appendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\na.
