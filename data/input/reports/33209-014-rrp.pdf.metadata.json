The project \nwill expand project outputs and activities to additional areas. It has a high degree of readiness in \ndesign,  implementation,  and  safeguards.  Its  design  and  implementation  arrangements  have \nbeen  reviewed  during  loan  processing,  and  adjustments  have  been  made  as  necessary.  The \nproject  remains  technically feasible,  economically  viable,  and financially  sound.  It  supports the \ngovernment\u2019s development objectives and is accorded top priority by the government.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nAgriculture  is  Nepal\u2019s  primary  economic  sector;  about  80%  of  the  population  is \ndependent on it. Since most of the poor reside in rural areas, Nepal\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \nrecognizes that agricultural growth is essential for attaining broad-based economic growth and \nimproving  livelihoods.  Agriculture  is  largely  based  on  low-value  crops  and  subsistence \nproduction,  with  only  about  17%  of  output  traded  in  markets.  Because  agriculture  growth  has \nbeen erratic, determined to a large extent by climatic factors, food production remains unstable.2 \nIrrigation  is  an  essential  input  to  improve  agriculture  productivity.  Nepal\u2019s  recently  completed \nAgriculture Development Strategy recognizes the importance of expanding the irrigated areas in \nan equitable and viable manner, and improving irrigation efficiency and management.3 The new \nIrrigation Policy (2013) also promotes improved agency- and farmer-managed irrigation systems \nto improve water efficiency and year-round irrigation.   \n\n4. \nThe expansion of irrigation from the mid-1970s provided an enabling environment for the \nuse of new high-yielding varieties and fertilizer. Irrigation expansion has also imparted a greater \ndegree  of  stability  to  farm  production.  Of  the  2.64  million  hectares  (ha)  of  cultivable  land  in \nNepal, 1.77 million ha is irrigable and about 1.33 million ha has access to irrigation. Investments \nare required to rehabilitate and improve existing irrigation  systems and strengthen water users \nassociations  (WUAs) \nImproved  agricultural \ntechnologies,  availability  of  inputs,  and  the  provision  of  supplementary  irrigation  during  the \nmonsoon season and full irrigation in the dry season can increase rice yields from about 3 tons \nper ha per year to as high as 10\u201312 tons per ha per year.4 Dependable irrigation also provides \nfarmers  with  an  incentive  to  diversify  from  low-value  cereal  crops  to  high-value  crops  such  as \nfruits and vegetables, and increase their incomes and nutrition at the same time.   \n\nto  operate  and  maintain \n\nthem  efficiently. \n\n                                                \n1   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Loan to Nepal for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project. Manila. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the overall project is in Appendix 1 and has been updated to conform with current ADB \nstandards. \n\n2   Agricultural  production  depends  on  a  4-month  monsoon,  when  75%  of  annual  rains  fall.  Climate  variability  and \nchange  in  Nepal  is  projected  to  exacerbate  existing  threats  to  food,  water,  and  livelihood  security  through \nalterations  in  the  quantity  and  timing of  precipitation  and  runoff, more atmospheric  water  vapor  and  evaporation, \nand progressive loss of glacier and snowpack storage in basin headwaters.  \n\n3   ADB.  2013.

Consultant\u2019s  report. \n\n(TA 7762-NEP). \n\nKathmandu (TA 7762-NEP). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nThe government has a mature program of assisting farmer-managed irrigation systems \n5. \n(FMIS)  to  upgrade  their  primary  infrastructure.  The  total  number  of  FMIS  is  estimated  at  over \n15,000, and about 3,000 have received some form of support from the government and various \ndevelopment  partners.  The  government  estimates  that  a  large  number  of  FMIS,  with  a \ncombined command area of about 250,000 ha, never received assistance. Additional financing \nfor the current project will allow rehabilitation and expansion efforts to reach a larger number of \nFMIS.  \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the current project on 17 November 2004 \n6. \nand  it  became  effective on  13  January  2006. It will  close  on  30  September  2014. The  current \nproject  had the  overall  goal  of  promoting  inclusive  economic  growth  while  reducing  poverty  in \nrural  areas.  Its  specific  objective  is  to  improve  the  agriculture  productivity  and  sustainability  of \nexisting  medium-sized  FMIS5 and  thereby  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  poor  men  and  women, \nincluding  ethnic  minorities  and  Dalit.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  project  is  rehabilitating \n111 FMIS,  with  strengthened  WUAs  in  the  central  and  eastern  development  regions.  The \ngovernment  also  provides  agricultural  extension  and  livelihood  enhancement  services  in \nsubproject areas. \n\nProject performance was assessed during preparation of the additional financing.6 Some \n7. \nof the targets for the current project were revised at midterm because of cost escalations. The \ncurrent  project  is  likely  to  meet  the  revised  targets.  Upon  completion  of  the  current  project  in \nSeptember  2014,  the  total  irrigation  command  area  improved  is  expected  to  be  15,677  ha \n(target 13,700 ha). The beneficiaries will total 178,285 (target 115,600). Although it is too early \nto  assess  achievement  of  agricultural  production  targets,  the  government\u2019s  initial  findings \nindicate  that  the  average  cropping  intensity  in  subproject  areas  has  increased  by  30%  (target \n40%), and annual major crop production has increased by 42,000 tons (target 32,100 tons). The \ncurrent  project  supported  the  reformulation  and  strengthening  of  WUAs,  and  nearly  80% \nfarmers  enrolled  as  members,  on  average.  Beneficiary  contributions \ntotaled  4.5%  of \nconstruction costs (target 3.0%). Its gender targets have been met. Women\u2019s representation in \nWUA  executive  committees  was  30%  (target  33%)  and  48%  in  agriculture  extension  activities \n(target 35%).  \n\nThe  quality  of  subproject  implementation  was  also  assessed.  Construction  works \n8. \nperformed  by  both  contractors  and  WUAs  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  Construction \nsupervision and timely supervision by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will be improved during \nthe  project  in  light  of  lessons  learned  from  the  current  project. 7  Social  and  institutional \ndevelopment focused on strengthening WUAs to manage their irrigation systems independently. \nThe current project trained lead farmers in preparing operation and maintenance (O&M) plans, \nbut more hands-on technical assistance is required through additional financing to ensure these \nplans are implemented. A new target of having an O&M and financing mechanism established \nfor each WUA has been set.  \n\n9. \nOnce the irrigation infrastructure is approved, equitable and adequate water distribution \nsystems should be established to optimize agricultural productivity. The current project did not \nallocate  resources or  expertise  to guide WUAs  in  constructing water  courses  to  bring  water to \nfarm  fields  or  in  agreeing  on  water  distribution  arrangements  to  meet  agricultural  goals.  The \n\n                                                \n5  Irrigation schemes covering 25\u2013500 ha in the hills and 200\u20132,000 ha in the Terai (the southern plains) are defined \n\nas medium-sized. \n\n6  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7   Actions to improve construction management have been agreed with the government and delineated in the Project \n\nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fadditional  financing  project  has  significantly  enhanced  procedures  and \narrangements for building WUA capacity in integrated crop and water management (ICWM). \n\nimplementation \n\n10. \nAs  of  28  February  2014,  overall  physical  progress  was  estimated  at  96%  against  the \nelapsed  loan  period  of  94%.  The  cumulative  contract  award  was  $16.13  million  (89.6%)  and \ndisbursement  was  $15.25  million  (84.7%).  Of  the  $7  million  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment  (OFID)  loan,  the  cumulative  contract  award  is  $5.88  million  (84%)  and \ndisbursement  was  $4.33  million  (61.85%).  The  current  project  is  expected  to  complete  the \nremaining  works  by  the  loan  closing  date  of  30  September  2014.  Due  to  construction  bids \nsubstantially below engineering cost estimates and significant currency fluctuation, $2 million of \nthe loan was cancelled in November 2013. Compliance with loan covenants and environmental \nand  social  safeguards  is  satisfactory.  The  eligibility  requirements  for  additional  financing  have \nbeen met.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nAdditional  financing  will  continue  to  focus  on  rehabilitating  and  extending  the  irrigation \n11. \ncoverage of farmer-managed irrigation systems in the central and eastern development regions. \nIt will also support the rehabilitation of select irrigation systems that are currently receiving direct \ngovernment  support;  the  management  will  be  transferred  to  WUAs  after  system  development \nand  WUA  strengthening.  The  project  will  be  implemented  through  about  70  community-based \nsubprojects. \n \n12. \nThe expected impact will be increased national food security. The expected outcome is \nthat participating farmers increase agricultural production. Productivity will be measured through \n(i) yields of major crops increased by at least 30% in subproject areas, and (ii) cropping intensity \nin irrigated areas increased by at least 30%.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nTo  achieve  its  expected  outcome,  the  project  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  farmers  in \nsubproject  areas  have  improved  irrigation  infrastructure;  (ii)  WUAs  independently  manage \nirrigation  systems  in  a  socially  inclusive  and  equitable  manner;  (iii)  farmers  adopt  improved \nagricultural  practices;  and  (iv)  national  institutions  are  strengthened  for  effective  irrigation \nservice delivery.    \n \nImproved  irrigation  infrastructure. The project will support the participatory planning, \n14. \ndetailed design, and construction of infrastructure such as diversion structures, cross-drainage \nworks,  improved  and  extended  canal  systems,  and  flood  protection  facilities.  All  subproject \ninfrastructure design will be done in close consultation with WUAs. The project will also support \nthe construction of tertiary water courses that bring the water to farm fields. WUAs will provide \nbeneficiary  contribution  in labor  and/or  cash for subproject  infrastructure  costs,  consistent  with \nthe government\u2019s Irrigation Policy (2013). \n \nIrrigation  systems  management.  The  project  will  empower  WUAs  to  manage  the \n15. \nrehabilitation  of  the  infrastructure,  operate  and  maintain  their  systems  without  government \nsupport, and distribute the water equitably and adequately throughout the command area. WUA \nexecutive committees will be reconstituted, as necessary, to ensure equal representation of the \nhead,  middle,  and  tail  of  the  canal  system,  and  to  empower  women  and  other  disadvantaged \nfarmers  to  lead  in  system  management.  WUAs  in  subprojects  that  are  currently  agency-\nmanaged will develop plans to manage their systems without government support.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nImproved  agricultural  practices.  Agricultural  practices  in  subproject  areas  are \n16. \npredominantly conventional. Farmers are using their own seed stock repeatedly for 5\u201310 years, \nresulting in lost production potential. Chemical fertilizer use is unbalanced, and farmers are not \nwell  trained  in  making  organic  fertilizers.  Inefficient  plot-to-plot  flooding  irrigation  is  regularly \npracticed rather than constructing field channels. The project will provide agricultural extension \nservices to subproject areas to build the capacity of farmers in sustainable agricultural systems.  \n \n17. \nInstitutional  strengthening and project management. The project has supported the \npreparation  of  policies  for  irrigation  and  integrated  water  resources  management,  a  national \nwater  plan,  improved  procedures  for  project  management,  revised  engineering  manuals,  and \ninstitutional strategy and action plans. The next phase of policy and institutional reforms will be \nsupported  through  additional  financing,  including  preparing  an  irrigation  act,  updating  the \nirrigation regulation, and preparing guidelines for management transfer and O&M. \n \nD. \n \n18. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $38.3 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\n  \n\n \n\n23.0 \n4.0 \n3.0 \n\n4.0 \n34.0 \n3.6 \n1.0 \n38.6 \n\n21.5 \n1.3 \n3.4 \n\n6.0 \n32.2 \n5.1 \n1.1 \n38.3 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n44.5 \n5.3 \n6.4 \n\n10.0 \n66.2 \n8.7 \n2.1 \n76.9 \n\nItem \nA.  \n\nBase Costc \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n\nOutput 1: Improved Irrigation Infrastructure \nOutput 2: Irrigation Systems Management \nOutput 3: Improved Agricultural Practices \nOutput 4: Institutional Strengthening and \nProject Management \n\nSubtotal (A) \nContingenciesd \nFinancing Charges During Implementatione \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\n \nB.  \nC.  \n \nNote: Figures may not sum precisely because of rounding. \na  Refers to the original amount and any previous additional financing.

It has already established a central project management \noffice (CPMO) for the current project. The CPMO will be headed by a full-time project director.8 \nIn  addition,  it  will  include  the  following  full-time  staff:  deputy  project  director,  account  officer, \naccountant,  and  supporting  staff  (administrative  assistant).  The  CPMO  is  responsible  for \nmanaging all aspects of project implementation.  \n\nThe  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  is  the  implementing  agency.

Activities supported by \nKFAED  will  be  financed  on  a  parallel  basis,  with  ADB  assuming  no  supervision  or  fiduciary \nobligations. OFID has also expressed interest to provide a loan of $30 million equivalent to the \ngovernment to finance additional subprojects beyond those to be financed by ADB and KFAED. \nThe  details  of  OFID\u2019s  involvement  are  being  finalized.  Once  the  nature  of  cofinancing \narrangement  is  finalized  with  OFID,  if  necessary,  a  separate  approval  of  the  Board  will  be \nsought. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n25. \nThe  implementation  systems  and  procedures  for  subproject  preparation,  design, \nconstruction  supervision  and  quality  control,  and  post-construction  support  for  O&M  were \nreviewed  during  loan  processing.  Relatively  simple  methodologies  and  tools  were  introduced, \nusing  the  latest  technologies  and  internet,  to  achieve  a  higher  and  more  consistent  level  of \nquality  in  project  preparation,  detailed  design,  and  monitoring  of  small-  and  medium-scale \nirrigation  schemes.  This  has  included  (i)  the  introduction  of  global  positioning  system  and \ngeographic  information  system-based  survey  and  mapping  methodologies;  (ii)  the  use  of \navailable  digital  topographic  mapping;  (iii)  high  resolution  satellite  imagery;  and  (iv)  the \n\n\fdevelopment  and  introduction  of  templates  and  automated  procedures  for  project  design, \nincluding  online  data  processing  and  report  generation.  These  standardized  procedures \nsignificantly  improved  the  quality  of  subproject  preparation  and,  as  all  documents  are  now \navailable  online,  review  and  quality  control  has  also  improved.  The  capacity  of  DOI  field  staff \nhas  improved,  and  they  take  the  lead  on  infrastructure  planning,  design,  construction \nsupervision, and O&M training. \n \n26. \nThe current project carried out very limited activities to support O&M, partly because of \nimplementation  delays.  To  improve  long-term  sustainability,  the  project  includes  support \nactivities for post-construction, including O&M training, on-farm level demonstrations, and ICWM \ntraining.  Post-construction  support  will  also  be  extended  for  one  full  year  after  completion  of \ninfrastructure rehabilitation. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n27. \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  on  a  sample  of  both  FMIS  and  agency-managed \nirrigation  system  (AMIS).  The  cultivated  command  area  (CCA)  of  sample  schemes  is  about \n50 ha  in  the  hills,  and  200  ha  to  300  ha  for  the  schemes  located  in  the  Terai.10 The  AMIS \nscheme is larger, with a CCA of 450 ha. The number of households cultivating land in the FMIS \nschemes analyzed is 35 to 300 in the hills, and 170 to 350 in the Terai. In the AMIS scheme, the \nnumber of households is 850. The percentage of households cultivating less than 1 ha is 54% to \n92%, and those cultivating less than 0.5 ha is 41% to 54%. \n \n28. \nEconomic  benefits  will  derive  from  an  increase  in  crop  yields  and  diversification  of \ncropping patterns toward higher value crops, resulting from improved irrigation delivery. Overall, \nan  increase  in  the  production  of  cereals  of  about  100  tons  per  year  on  FMIS  schemes  in  the \nhills, and 480 tons per year on schemes in the Terai is expected. On the larger AMIS scheme \nanalyzed,  cereal  production  is  expected  to  increase  by  almost  800  tons  per  year.  Incremental \nproduction  of  vegetables  varies  significantly  across  schemes  but \n100\u2013800 tons per year. Annual increases in the value of production across all schemes range \nfrom  NRs12  million  to  NRs76  million.  Economic  analysis  indicates  that  for  the  FMIS,  the \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  range  from  29.6%  to  55.8%.  The  economic  internal  rates  of \nreturn  of  the  AMIS  scheme  analyzed  is  35.5%.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  scheme \neconomic  viability  is  not  sensitive  to  adverse  changes  in  benefits  or  costs  or  delays  in  the \nattainment  of  benefits.  The  project  is  also  financially  sustainable.  Farm  income  analysis \nindicates  significant  increases in farm  incomes, suggesting that farm  households will  have the \nirrigation \nthe \ncapacity \ninfrastructure through their contributions to WUAs. \n \nC. \n\nincreased  O&M  costs  associated  with  rehabilitated \n\nGovernance \n\nis  expected \n\nfinance \n\nto \n\n29. \nThe project supports local governance, financial and administrative decentralization, and \noversight of public development expenditure by deepening the transparency and accountability \nof  public  service  delivery  through  local  government  units  that  select  and  manage  their  own \nsubprojects,  and  by  building  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  for \nfinancial  discipline,  responsibility,  transparency,  and  accountability.  A  financial  management \nassessment of the DOI and DOA was conducted, and a risk assessment and risk management \nplan was prepared.11 The assessment concluded that the DOI\u2019s and DOA\u2019s capacity is sufficient \n\n                                                \n10  The southern plains region. \n11  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\nto  be                 \n\n\f8 \n\nto  carry  out  the  project  with  training  and  oversight  from  ADB.  The  project  aims  to  support  the \npost-conflict  approach  outlined  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132012  by  identifying \nand managing potential conflict risks and opportunities.12 \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith  the  government  and  the  DOI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 9). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThe  project  involves  rehabilitating  existing  irrigation  systems  that  serve  the  poor, \ndisadvantaged and vulnerable farmers, and sharecroppers in the eastern and central regions of \nNepal;  and  addresses  the  issues  of  hunger  and  undernutrition  and  improving  access  to  agri-\ntechnology and inputs through improved irrigation and crop diversification and intensification\u2014\nresulting  in  an  increase  in  household  income  for  a  more  food-secure  future.  Defined  on  the \nbasis of food sufficiency, 30% of the proposed beneficiaries are $1.25-a-day poor.13 The project \nis based on demand-driven, participatory planning processes. A shift to irrigated agriculture and \nvegetable farming is expected to lift most of the poor above the poverty line. \n \n32. \nThe project is classified as having an effective gender mainstreaming theme. A gender \nequity  and  social  inclusion  plan  has  been  made  an  integral  part  of  the  project  design  and  is \ncovered by one of the covenants.14 The current project\u2019s adherence to the government policy\u2014\nrequiring  at  least  33%  women\u2019s  representation  in  all  registered  WUAs\u2014has  gradually \ndiminished  opposition  to  women\u2019s  involvement  in  WUA  committees.  However,  as  women\u2019s \nparticipation is deemed to be a token, this highlights the need for extra capacity building training \nfor women WUA executive members to enable them to participate on a par with local elites and \nmale counterparts. This project addresses such issues through leadership and technical training \nfor WUA executive committee members, gender equity and social inclusion sensitization training \nfor members of WUA executive committees, and training for leader farmers. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment. The  project  is  classified category  B for  environment  as  it  is  unlikely  that \n33. \nany  proposed  subprojects  will  lead  to  irreversible  damage.  Any  subproject  screened  as \ncategory A will not be financed. Potential impacts from climate change and natural disasters on \nthe  project  and  its  proposed  interventions  have  been  screened.15 Rehabilitation  of  irrigation \nheadworks  and  canals  may  result  in  a  few  negative  impacts  that  can  easily  be  mitigated. \nScreening  for  environmental  impacts  will  be  conducted  on  each  subproject  and  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  prepared.  The  approved  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework,  as  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  provides  guidance  on  categorization  and \nprocedures  to  be  followed  during  implementation. 16  Contracts  for  subprojects  that  require \nenvironmental  assessments  will  be  awarded  only  after  approval  of  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations and environmental management plans by ADB and the government (if required), \n\n                                                \n12  ADB.  2009.

A grievance redress committee will be established \nin  each  subproject  area  to  receive,  evaluate,  and  facilitate  resolution  of  affected  people\u2019s \nconcerns on environmental and social issues. \n\nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is categorized C for involuntary resettlement. It is \n34. \ndesigned  to  be  based  on  voluntary  donation  of  land,  on  demand,  from  the  poor  and \nmarginalized farmers, sharecroppers, and leaseholders. A voluntary land donation due diligence \nframework17 has been prepared to help assess the involuntary resettlement safeguard status of \na proposed subproject, and confirm that the selection criteria involving the voluntary donation of \nland  have  been  met.  Any  subproject  requiring  involuntary  land  acquisition  will  be  dropped. \nIrrigation  improvement must  be  desired  by  a community.  If  any  land  acquisition  is  required for \nirrigation enhancement, community members will voluntarily donate small parcels of their land, \nand they will be considered primary beneficiaries of the enhanced irrigation facility. Procedures \nhave been established to verify that the land is being provided voluntarily by those who stand to \ngain  directly,  and  to  verify  that  the  subproject  will  cause  no  impoverishment.  Land  donation \nshould not exceed 10% of a farmer\u2019s agricultural landholding within the command area, or the \nWUA  must  provide  livelihood  restitution  measures.  The  land  donation  will  be  verified  by \nwitnesses  and  documented.  Grievance  redress  committees  will  address  any  grievances.  The \nDOI has a long history of facilitating voluntary land donation, and the due diligence arrangement \nhas been working well under the current project which was also categorized C. No grievances \nare outstanding. \n \n35. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  While  the \nproject  expects  to  reach  areas  with  high  percentages  of  Janajatis  (the  indigenous  peoples \ncommunities), the indigenous peoples safeguard requirements will not be triggered because the \nproject  does  not  directly  or  indirectly  affect  their  dignity,  human  rights,  livelihood  systems,  or \nculture or cultural properties. The project is demand-driven, based on voluntary donation of land \nand  is  for  the  benefit  of  the  poor,  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  farmers,  sharecroppers,  and \nleaseholders  that  include  the  indigenous  peoples  communities.  A  due  diligence  framework  for \nindigenous peoples impact screening, with a checklist, has been prepared. Subproject selection \ncriteria  will  exclude  proposals  that  involve  any  adverse  impact  on  the  indigenous  peoples \ncommunities and that will not qualify as category C for the indigenous peoples safeguard.18  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in  detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nProject implementation will be through two \ngovernment agencies and 65 units. They have \nlimited understanding of ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement guidelines and will incur a large \nvolume of small transactions. This could result in \ninadequate financial reporting. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe DOI will establish a computerized project \naccounting system. A computer-based financial \ninformation system with necessary hardware and \ninternet access will be established at district level \nimplementing entities. A financial management \nconsultant will provide regular financial management \ntraining for accounting staff in all project implementing \nentities, in particular in project budgeting, reporting \n\n                                                \n17  Voluntary Land Donation Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Indigenous Peoples Screening Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nMalfeasance could occur in bidding for civil \nworks contracts. Potential risks include the \nimposition of informal conditions, illicit payments \nfor officials, bid rigging, collusion and fraud, and \ndeviations from original bid documents. \n\nGovernment staff could provide insufficient \noversight and monitoring of performance of civil \nworks contractors. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nrequirements, and ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. \nThe DOI will closely supervise procurement to \nminimize such risks, and ADB will conduct prior review \nof bid evaluations before contract awarding. A \nprocurement specialist will conduct annual audits to \ncheck for irregularities in the bidding and awarding of \ncontracts, and report findings to the DOI and ADB for \nfollow-up. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) will be disseminated to all project \nstaff and stakeholders. Upon the recommendation of \nthe CPMO, the public procurement monitoring office \nwill blacklist contractors and suppliers proven to be \ninvolved in corrupt activities. The chief district officer, \nwho has responsibility for anticorruption, will receive \nand act upon genuine complaints. \nThe DOI has agreed on actions for improving contract \nmanagement. Performance conditions have been \nstrengthened in bidding documents. Project \nconsultants will train and assist government staff in \nmonitoring performance. The DOI will establish a \nperformance-based incentive system to reward the \nDOI staff with strong performance. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CPMO = central project management office, DOI = Department of Irrigation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n37. \nThe government and the DOI have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n38. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n\nThe  government  and  the  DOI  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n39. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \nSDR19,418,000  to  Nepal  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Community-Managed  Irrigated \nAgriculture Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;
