No  negative  environmental  impact  from  the  Project  is \nAssessment  foreseen. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  affirms  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  promote  the \ninclusive socioeconomic development of the most disadvantaged groups, \nparticularly ethnic minorities and girls, in 103 of the poorest districts in \nViet Nam, through universal lower secondary education.  \n \nThe Project will improve access to more equitable learning opportunities \nfor  disadvantaged  groups  and  will  strengthen  social  and  economic \ninclusion through universal secondary education. Specifically, the Project \nwill (i) improve access to lower secondary education, (ii) enhance the \nquality and relevance of secondary education, (iii) pilot-test and evaluate \ninnovative approaches to give disadvantaged groups better access to \neducation, and (iv) strengthen capacity to plan and manage targeted \nsupport for ethnic minorities and girls. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  net  enrollment  rate  in  lower  secondary \neducation in the 103 target districts from 76.4% in 2005 to 85% in 2013. \nIt  will  achieve  this  improvement  by  (i)  building  schools,  classrooms, \nsemi-boarding  facilities,  and  teacher  housing  in  remote  areas; \n(ii) providing  in-service  and  pre-service  teacher  training  to  meet  the \nneeds of ethnic minorities and girls; (iii) developing instructional materials \nincluding  bilingual  materials  in  the  Vietnamese  and  ethnic  minority \nlanguages, and materials for information and communication technology \ntraining  and  on  the  ethnic  minority  education  management  system; \n(iv) providing  targeted  scholarships;  and  (v)  pilot-testing  innovative \ninitiatives  including  school  feeding  programs  and  awareness-raising \nprograms to promote secondary education among the hardest-to-reach \ngroups.  \n   \nRationale  Viet Nam has enjoyed remarkable economic growth accompanied by \nsignificant  reduction  in  poverty  over  the  past  decade.  But  disparities \nremain. The locus of poverty has shifted: formerly widespread throughout \nthe  population,  poverty  afflicts  particularly  vulnerable  groups  that  are \nharder  to  reach.  The  Government,  as  stated  in  its  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010,  is  committed  to  the  inclusive \ndevelopment  of  the  disadvantaged  groups  through  more  equitable \ndelivery of social services and more equitable economic growth. \n ", "ii   \n  Ethnic  minorities,  about  14%  of  the  population,  are  particularly \ndisadvantaged. In 2004, ethnic minorities composed 39% of all those \nliving in poverty, and 61% of all ethnic minorities were poor. While the \ncountry  has  made  solid  progress  toward  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals,  ethnic  minorities  score  lower  on  most  social \nindicators. The low level of human capital among minorities due to lack \nof basic education is a critical challenge.  \n \nThe  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  (SESMP)  2006\u20132010, \nidentifies constraints on the education of ethnic minorities and girls in \nViet  Nam  in  three  key  areas:  (i)  access  and  equity,  (ii)  quality  and \nrelevance,  and  (iii)  efficiency  and  sustainability.  Improvements  in \nparticipation  rates  are  hampered  by  (i)  physical  distance  to  schools, \n(ii) unaffordable direct and indirect costs of secondary education, (iii) lack \nof proficiency in the Vietnamese language, (iv) lack of public awareness \nof the value of schooling, (v) poor quality of teaching, (vi) high dropout \nand repetition rates, and (vii) limited capacity to plan targeted support for \ndisadvantaged groups. \n \nTo  tackle  these  challenges,  SESMP  2006\u20132010  proposes  a  national \naction plan for providing targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups by \n(i) building  more  boarding  schools  and  training  more  ethnic  minority \nteachers,  (ii)  offering  flexible  scholarship  programs  to  increase \nopportunities in secondary and higher education in disadvantaged areas, \n(iii) creating the conditions for minority students to learn and become \nfluent  in  Vietnamese  along  with  their  own  languages,  (iv)  prioritizing \ntraining for minority teachers and teachers with knowledge of minority \nlanguages,  and  (v)  giving  specific  incentives  and  support  to  girls  in \nremote areas. The Project is the first investment that directly supports \nthis action plan. \n    \nImpact and  The Project is expected to promote universal secondary education and, \nOutcome  hence,  greater  social  and  economic  inclusion  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ndisadvantaged groups. Its outcome will be improved lower secondary \neducation participation rates, particularly for girls and ethnic minorities, in \n103 of the most disadvantaged districts in 17 provinces. \n   \nProject  Investment  The investment cost of the project is estimated at $64 million equivalent, \nPlan   including taxes and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing Plan \n \nTotal \nSource  ($ million)    % \nAsian Development Bank  50.00    78.1\nGovernment of Viet Nam     \nCentral Government  9.90    15.5\nProvincial Government  4.10    6.4\nTotal    64.00    100.0\n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "iii \n  ADB will provide a loan of SDR31,860,000 ($50 million equivalent) from \nits Special Funds resources to cover 78.1% of the cost. The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year after \nthat, and other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  financing  for  the  remaining \n$14 million equivalent (21.9%)\u2014$9.9 million equivalent (15.5%) from the \ncentral  budget  and  $6.4  million  equivalent  (6.4%)  from  provincial \nbudgets\u2014for land acquisition, maintenance of facilities, and procurement \nof equipment under the Project. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 31 December 2014 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \n   \nImplementation  MOET  will  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  with  overall \nArrangements  responsibility for project management and implementation. A national \n  project  implementation  unit  (NPIU)  and  17  provincial  project \n  implementation  units  (PPIUs)  will  be  established,  with  technical  and \n  implementation  support  from  project  consultants,  advisers,  and \nfacilitators. District coordination committees will include school principals \nand staff of teacher training colleges. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and works will be procured according to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \ngovernment procedures. The NPIU, in close cooperation with relevant \nPPIUs and bureaus of education and training, will be responsible for all \nprocurement. National competitive bidding procedures consistent with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines will be used. ADB and the Borrower must \nagree on any modification or clarification of the procedures. \n   \nConsulting  All consultants whose services are to be financed from the proceeds of \nServices  the loan will be selected according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consulting \nservices for the Project will total 489 person-months (74 international and \n415 national). The consultants will have expertise in educational planning \nand management, procurement, civil works, resettlement, scholarship, \nteacher training, ethnic minority and gender education, and monitoring \nand evaluation. Project facilitation advisers will be selected and hired \nindividually. The international firm will be selected and hired through \nquality- and cost-based selection, weighted according to ADB\u2019s standard \nquality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  The  overseas  training  provider  will  be \nselected through consultant qualification. \n   \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits  Improved access to secondary education will directly benefit the entire \nand Beneficiaries  lower  secondary  education-eligible  cohort  in  the  103  target  districts \n(totaling about 700,000 children aged 11\u201314). The direct benefits to the \nsector  will  accrue  from  (i)  significantly  narrower  gaps  in  access  to \nsecondary  schooling  between  ethnic,  gender,  and  socioeconomic \ngroups;  (ii) teaching  and  learning  that  is  more  relevant  and  more \nresponsive  to  local  demands;  and  (iii)  stronger  capacity  of  local \neducation authorities to plan, manage, and deliver education services. \n \nKey social benefits will include (i) better awareness of the benefits of \nlower  secondary  schooling  among  minority  commune  leaders  and \nparents; (ii) improved participation of girls in lower secondary education; \n(iii)  more  ethnic  minority  youth  able  to  find  nonfarm  employment, \nresulting in higher average household incomes; (iv) more ethnic minority \nteachers, particularly women, serving as role models for ethnic minority \nstudents;  (v) a  stable  supply  of  qualified  teachers  to  remote  minority \nschools  to  help  preserve  minority  languages  and  culture;  and  (vi) \ncontinuing education opportunities for out-of-school youth. \n   \nRisks and  Project risks could come from (i) low demand for secondary education \nAssumptions  among the hardest-to-reach groups, (ii) high teacher turnover, (iii) low \n  financial sustainability in the medium term, and (iv) resettlement.  \n   \nA key assumption is that all civil works will be done on existing school \ngrounds or on government-owned land, and that no land acquisition or \nresettlement  will  be  necessary.  To  mitigate  the  risk,  a  resettlement \nframework has been developed in accordance with Government Decree \nNo. 197/2004/ND-CP (2004) regarding compensation, assistance and \nresettlement where land is recovered by the state and ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). \n \nOne of the risks of an education project that strives to reach the most \nexcluded students with new school buildings and physical facilities is that \ndemand for education will remain low. To mitigate this risk, the Project is \ndesigned to balance interventions on the supply side\u2014new classrooms, \ntraining for teaching staff, etc.\u2014with activities on the demand side such \nas scholarships, school feeding programs, and community awareness \nactivities.  In  remote  schools  in  the  poorest  areas,  where  teacher \nretention rates are low, the Project attempts to deal with one of the main \nreasons why teachers leave, namely, poor-quality teacher housing. \n \nA drop in the recurrent budget allocations for operation and maintenance \nand teachers\u2019 salaries is a medium-term risk, in view of the revenue-poor \ndistricts and disadvantaged students targeted by the Project. However, \nanalysis indicates the Government\u2019s sustained commitment to education \nin  budgetary  allocation.  In  2006,  20%  of  public  expenditure  went  to \neducation. While the sector will most likely continue to be a priority for \nthe Government, as set out in SEDP 2006\u20132010, special assistance \nprograms for targeted districts and disadvantaged students should hold \nfirm for the targets related to universal lower secondary education to be \nachieved and project investments to be sustainable. \n ", "i \n \n ", "1 \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Lower  Secondary  Education  for  the  Most \nDisadvantaged Regions Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Indicators and Analysis of Performance \n \n2.  Viet Nam has enjoyed remarkable economic growth accompanied by significant income \npoverty reduction over the past decade. Gross domestic product per capita increased from $288 \nin 1993 to $622 in 2004. The incidence of income poverty fell from 58% in 1993 to 23% in 2004 \nas  broad-based  reforms  after  doi  moi  (renewal)  led  to  vigorous  growth  with  diversified \nemployment opportunities, greater macroeconomic and political stability, and targeted programs \nto provide basic public infrastructure and services. With this overwhelmingly positive transition, \nhowever, has come socioeconomic polarization. From being widespread throughout the general \npopulation, poverty has become concentrated among specific vulnerable groups that are much \nharder to reach. The incidence of poverty is 18% nationwide and only 14% in urban areas, but it \nis a much higher 26% in rural areas. Regional disparities are striking: the incidence of poverty in \nthe Northwest region was 52% in 2004, compared with just 6% in the Southeast region. Poverty \nlevels in the Northeast (29%) and Central Highlands (33%) regions were also well above the \nnational average.1 \n \n3.  Ethnic minorities\u201412 million in all, or about 14% of the population of Viet Nam\u2014are \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  poverty.  Ethno-linguistically,  they  represent  a  diverse  range  of \n53 minorities that live mostly in the remote mountainous areas and lowland river deltas. The \npoorest areas of Viet Nam tend to have a high concentration of ethnic minorities. In 2004, \nminorities composed 39% of the population living in poverty, and 61% of all ethnic minority \npeople were poor (as opposed to only 14% of the majority Kinh and Chinese).2 The proportion \nof ethnic minorities in the poor population has nearly doubled in 11 years. If these trends persist, \nby 2010 poverty will be overwhelmingly an issue of ethnicity.3 \n \n4.  Poverty  among  minority  groups  is  closely  associated  with  low  or  limited  access  to \neducation and training opportunities. The main reasons are lack of infrastructure, physical \ndistance,  language  and  cultural  barriers,  the  small  number  and  poor  quality  of  teachers, \nunsuitability  of  the curriculum  to  local  needs,  low  investment  in  education  because  of  the \nperceived  low  returns,  and  high  opportunity  costs.  Enrollment  and  completion  rates  for \nminorities are generally below the average, and for minority girls they are even lower. In the \n2005 school year, girls made up 48% of lower secondary students nationwide. In the Northwest, \nwhere 82% of lower secondary students come from minorities, less than 44% of these students \nare girls. Dropout rates tend to be higher for minorities. In 2004\u20132005, the dropout rate for the \nMekong River Delta region was 13%, almost twice the national average of 7%. \n \n5.  The Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010. The Government prepared the \n5-year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010  to  promote  inclusive  social \ndevelopment  and  sustained  economic  growth.  SEDP  2006\u20132010  underscores  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to 14 major economic, social, and environmental policy targets, \n                                                 \n1  Government of Viet Nam. 2005.

Draft background paper for the Committee for Ethnic Minorities/Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment Meeting on Ethnic Minority Poverty, September 2006. ", "2 \nincluding (i) a slower population growth rate of 1.14%, (ii) reduced poverty, (iii) universal lower \nsecondary education (LSE),4 (iv) a contraction in the agricultural labor force to 50% of the total, \n(v) job creation and a stable unemployment rate, and (vi) less malnutrition. Key features of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010  are  an  emphasis  on  the  equitable  delivery  of  social  services  to \ndisadvantaged groups, and a strong results orientation with performance indicators including the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the localized but in many ways more ambitious \nViet Nam development goals (VDGs).  \n \n6.  In the social sectors, SEDP 2006\u20132010 accords priority to the further development of \neducation  and  training.  The  MDGs  and  VDGs  include  the  following  education  targets: \n(i) universal  primary  education  by  2015,  (ii)  universal  progression  to  grade  5  by  2015, \n(iii) universal youth (aged 15\u201324) literacy by 2015, (iv) gender parity in basic education by 2005, \n(v) gender parity in youth literacy, and (vi) preservation of the ability to read and write in ethnic \nminority languages. SEDP 2006\u20132010 notes the positive performance of the education sector \nbut also significant constraints such as the lower enrollment and poor quality of secondary \neducation in remote areas, an outmoded and ineffective training system, and an inadequate \nframework for regulating private educational institutions and the quality of services they provide. \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 points out as well the limited learning opportunities for ethnic minorities and \ngirls as a major shortcoming.  \n \n7.  While the country has made solid progress toward achieving the MDGs and VDGs, \nethnic minority groups fare badly on most social indicators\u2014hunger and poverty, literacy and \nenrollment, maternal health care, gender equality, and access to clean water and sanitation. \nThe  low  level  of  human  capital  among  minorities  is  a  critical  challenge.  In  response,  the \nGovernment has issued a decree that specifically directs special assistance programs to the 18 \nsmallest ethnic minority groups.5 \n \n8.  Overview of the Education Sector. In Viet Nam, education is viewed as strongly linked \nto  economic  growth,  and  a  principal  investment  option  for  long-term  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. The national education policy rests on the central pillar of rapid human resource \ndevelopment to meet the labor needs of a highly competitive market economy, within a socialist \nframework to ensure a high degree of equity. With the achievement of near-universal primary \neducation,  the  Government\u2019s  principal  sector  goal  is  now  universal  secondary  education, \ndefined as a net enrollment rate (NER) of 90% for LSE. The education sector is analyzed in \ndetail in Appendix 1. \n \n9.  Government efforts so far have significantly expanded the general coverage of LSE\u2013 \nNER was 83% in the 2005\u20132006 school year.6 However, as with the incidence of poverty, the \nnational  average  masks  persistent  disparities  in  the  quality  and  accessibility  of  schooling, \nparticularly between genders and between ethnic communities. The 6% of the population that is \nilliterate mostly belongs to minority groups, and is made up for the most part of women and girls. \nThe 2004 Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey revealed that less than one third (only \n29%) of all ethnic minority adults (18 years and older) had completed LSE. Many people \nbelonging  to  minority  groups  are  not  fluent  in  the  Vietnamese  language,  and  this  factor \ncontributes to low school enrollment and high dropout rates, and a general sense of exclusion. \nIn the culturally diverse Northern Mountain region, the Hmong and Dao people rank among the \npoorest, living at higher elevations where access is difficult and agricultural productivity low. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

Data on 2005\u20132006 from the education management information \nsystem. ", "3 \nBecause of this low productivity, more children are needed to assist in agricultural activities, and \nhouseholds are therefore larger. The Hmong have the lowest education participation rates in the \ncountry: in 2002, the gross enrollment rate for Hmong children was less than 10%.7 Enrollment \nrates  for  the  Dao  were  only  slightly  better,  at  20%.  Strategic,  innovative,  and  targeted \nassistance is required to include the most difficult-to-reach groups (e.g., ethnic minorities and \ngirls in the poorest regions). \n \n10.  The national education and training system extends from nursery school to postgraduate \ndoctoral programs, and comprises both formal and nonformal and continuing education. There \nare  four  levels  of  formal  education:  pre-primary,  primary  (grades  1\u20135),  lower  secondary \n(grades 6\u20139), and upper secondary (grades 10\u201312). At the upper secondary level, students \neither enroll in upper secondary education (USE) and possibly continue to higher education, or \nopt  for  professional  secondary  education  and  vocational  training.  Continuing  education \nprograms cater to students who drop out of school but wish to continue their education in a less \nformal  setting  or  hope  to  qualify  for  re-enrollment  in  formal  education.  These  nationwide \nprograms use a modified curriculum and take place at continuing education centers (CECs) in \nthe provinces and districts. \n \n11.  The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has overall responsibility for setting the \nbroad policy direction for all levels of education. Responsibility for managing school buildings, \nstaffing, and distribution of financial resources is progressively decentralized. MOET manages \nthe  universities  directly,  but  has  delegated  the  management  of  upper  secondary  and \nprofessional  secondary  schools  to  the  provincial  departments  of  education  and  training \n(DOETs), and lower secondary and primary schools to the district bureaus of education and \ntraining (BOETs). Education sector spending in relation to gross domestic product (GDP) has \nrisen, from 3.5% in 1994 to 4.6% in 2004. Compared with other sectors, education receives \npriority, its share of public expenditure increasing to 20% in 2006.8 \n \n12.  The Government passed a new education law in June 2005 to improve the quality of \neducation and make it more generally accessible. The law outlines the goals and principles of \neducation. In addition, these supporting policy documents guide decision making for the sector: \n(i) the  Education  Strategic  Development  Plan  2001\u20132010,  (iii)  the  National  Action  Plan  for \nEducation for All (NAPEFA) 2003\u20132015, (iii) the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth \nStrategy, and (iv) the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (SESMP) 2006\u20132010.9  \n \n13.  The  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  2006\u20132010.  Despite  steadily \nincreasing  enrollment  rates,  MOET  realizes  that  achieving  universal  LSE  requires  a  more \nstrategic policy framework based on a detailed subsector review and better-harmonized aid. \nMOET therefore developed the SESMP 2006\u20132010 in 2006, with assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO);  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA);  and  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF).  SESMP  2006\u20132010,  grounded  in  a  results-based  monitoring \nframework,  comprises  (i)  goals  and  targets for  secondary  education,  (ii)  a  national  school \nmapping program, (iii) an action plan for targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups, (iv) a \nprogram of fiscal review of secondary education, and (v) a donor coordination matrix.  \n \n14.

Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n15.  The review of the secondary education subsector based on the SESMP 2006\u20132010 has \nidentified the following problems in access and equity, quality and relevance, and efficiency and \nsustainability that are key obstacles to the achievement of universal LSE.  \n \n1.  Challenges in the Secondary Education Subsector \n \na.  Access and Equity \n \n16.  Low Access. The high enrollment rate of 83% in lower secondary school is a national \naverage that masks disparities in access and quality of schooling by gender, ethnic, regional, \nand socioeconomic status. Only 34 out of 64 provinces have achieved universal LSE. In some \nprovinces, the disparities are widening. Innovative and targeted assistance is needed to bring \nthe most difficult-to-reach groups, such as ethnic minorities and girls in the poorest communes, \ninto the education system.  \n \n17.  Physical distance is the main obstacle to school enrollment and participation, especially \nin remote rural areas. In the Northern Mountain and Central Highland regions, it can take \nstudents the better part of a day to walk to school in very mountainous terrain. In the Mekong \nRiver Delta, students travel to school by boat and on foot but are often kept from attending \nschool by flooding. Remote areas have limited semi-boarding facilities, where students can stay \nduring the week, but most are severely inadequate. The demand for such facilities in minority \nareas  is  high,  despite  their  poor  condition,  and  far  exceeds  the  supply.  In  their  absence, \nstudents resort to staying in private homes, usually in exchange for physical labor or a nominal \nrent. Both lower secondary schools (LSSs) and CECs do not have enough classrooms to \nabsorb the ethnic minority youth. More schools and CECs and secure semi-boarding facilities in \nrural remote areas will relieve the constraints on access. \n \n18.  Financial and Cultural Barriers. Households incur substantial direct and indirect costs \nfor education, including school fees and the cost of textbooks, materials, uniforms, food, and \ntransportation, all of which combine to hinder school enrollment among poor families. A large \npart of the opportunity cost of education, which increases at the LSE level, is the loss of child \nlabor from household production. Poor families, for this reason, are held back from investing in \nthe  education  of  their  children,  particularly  daughters,  for  whom  the  opportunity  costs  are \ngreater. The contribution of the child to the family income  may be more important to the \nhousehold in the short term. Primary pupils from the poorest quintile of the population work \ntwice as long as students from the richest quintile, and female students work 20\u201350% longer \nhours than males across all income quintiles and ethnic groups. There is a need for more \nfocused measurements of the financial burden of direct education costs on poor families and \ninnovative awareness-raising programs to promote the longer-term benefits of investing in their \nchildren\u2019s secondary education. \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2006. Action Plan for the Targeted Assistance to the Disadvantaged Groups. Appendix 4 of Secondary \nEducation Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010. Manila. ", "5 \n19.  Language  Barriers.  Lack  of  fluency  in  the  Vietnamese  language  also  limits  the \nparticipation rate of minority students.11 A recent UNICEF ethno-linguistic study found a close \nlink between language barriers and poor academic performance among minority students, and \nthe consequent grade repetitions and dropouts.12 Many minority children with little or no prior \nexposure to the Vietnamese language have difficulty understanding lessons. In the northern \nuplands  in  particular,  this  situation  can  be  heightened  by  the  confusing  mix  of  minority \nlanguages spoken in the same classroom and by teachers who have not been trained to teach \nin a multilingual and multicultural environment. To address this issue, methods of teaching in a \nmulticultural environment and of teaching Vietnamese to ethnic minority students must be made \npart of pre-service teacher training. \n \n20.  Gender Disparities. A gender imbalance in educational attainment persists. There are \nfewer girls than boys enrolled at all levels of the education system except in professional \nsecondary education. A small but significant gender gap in enrollment in both primary education \nand LSE has not improved significantly over the last 5 years.13 Mean years of schooling offer a \nstark illustration of this gap: on average, girls complete only 5.6 years of schooling compared \nwith 6.8 years for boys. This gap widens dramatically when ethnicity is factored in: Kinh boys \nachieve 8.5 mean years of schooling, compared with just 4.5 years for ethnic minority girls. \nImproved, girl-friendly school facilities and programs aimed at making parents more aware of \nthe benefits of educating their daughters will help reduce this imbalance.  \n \n21.  Out-of-School  Youth.  Dropout  rates  are  highest  in  the  provinces  where  relatively \nwell-paid unskilled work is readily available. In some provinces in the Mekong River Delta\u2014\nwhere tourism and garments are growth industries\u2014families often consider sending children to \nwork rather than to school as a more profitable option. In some provinces an estimated 20% of \n11- to 14-year-olds do seasonal work in the factories in neighboring provinces. Motivating \noverage youth dropouts to reenter the formal school system is hard . In such cases, CECs can \nprovide alternative learning opportunities. Continuing education can be better tailored to meet \ntheir needs for vocational and life skills while earning them a secondary leaving certificate, \nwhich may even induce them to rejoin the formal education system later on. CECs in poor areas \nare currently limited in number, and many suffer from overcrowding. More CEC facilities are \nneeded to ease the overcrowding and improve access for out-of-school youth. \n \nb.  Quality and Relevance \n \n22.  Poor Quality of Teaching. Real improvement in student learning will occur and become \nsustainable  only  when  teachers  are  fully  trained,  prepared,  and  supported  through  the \ncomplexities of teaching ethnic minority students. But ethnic minority schools in remote areas \ntend to suffer even more than schools elsewhere in the country from poor-quality teaching, \nlimited learning resources, high teacher absenteeism, and rapid turnover of staff. While the \nteachers generally have good knowledge and the majority are certified, they have significant \nweaknesses in practical teaching skills. These weaknesses are due to such factors as the \nfollowing: (i) an intense focus on the acquisition of knowledge at the expense of teaching \nmethods  in  both  pre-service  teacher  training  (PRESETT)  and  in-service  teacher  training \n(INSETT), (ii) culturally and linguistically inappropriate education, (iii) gender and ethnicity bias \nin instructional materials, and (iv) a lack of effective strategies for motivating young teachers \nstruggling in difficult teaching environments and providing them with long-term career paths.  \n \n23.  It is difficult to recruit experienced teachers for remote areas, and current recruitment \n                                                 \n11  Kosonen, Kimmo. 2004. Language in Education Policy and Practice in Vietnam. Hanoi. \n12  Benson, Carol. 2006. UNICEF Report on Consultancy in Bilingual Education. Hanoi. \n13 MOET. 2005. Statistical Yearbook 2005. Hanoi. \n ", "6 \nand deployment strategies coerce rather than motivate. Teachers in remote schools are often \nnew graduates from teacher training colleges (TTCs) who are inexperienced, unfamiliar with \nethnic minority languages and culture, and ill-equipped to teach disadvantaged students. New \nteachers need mentoring and guidance by teacher trainers, but opportunities to develop skills \nand  gain  support  are  meager.  Schools  in  the  poorest  areas  are  under-resourced,  lacking \nteaching and learning materials, as well as adequate teacher accommodation. Providing on-site \nhousing as part of the employment package would address a key reason for the high turnover \nrate of teachers in ethnic minority areas. \n \n24.  Limited Learning Materials and Facilities. An effective learning environment requires \nwell-equipped facilities\u2014such as libraries and science laboratories\u2014and enough good-quality \nlearning materials that match the needs and interests of ethnic minority students and girls. \nHowever, the recurrent budgets of most schools are far from adequate to cover supplementary \nmaterials, and, for most poor ethnic minority families, textbooks are unaffordable unless highly \nsubsidized. Suitable resource facilities, equipment, and supplementary materials, as well as \ntraining of teachers in their use, would significantly improve the quality of learning and student \nachievement. \n \nc.  Efficiency and Sustainability \n \n25.  Low Retention, High Repetition and Dropout Rates. The average number of years \nneeded to complete LSE in 2004 was 4.8 nationwide, but 5.7 in the Mekong River Delta, 5.0 in \nthe Central Highlands, and 5.3 on average for ethnic minorities. The average LSS completion \nrate that same year was 76% for the country as a whole but only 58% in the Mekong River Delta \n(footnote 6). These figures highlight the lower efficiency of services in remote areas. Minorities \ncompose 14% of enrollment in LSE and 12% in USE\u2014roughly equivalent to their overall share \nof the population. However, at both lower and upper secondary levels overage enrollment is \nlikely to be significant as minorities in remote areas often delay enrolling their children in primary \nschool because of the long distances they must travel to school.  \n \n26.  For minority students, repetition rates at the primary level are higher, leading to overage \nentry  into  LSE,  and  correct-age  enrollment  is  likely  to  be  lower  than  the  total  figures. \nNationwide, the minority population aged 11\u201314 is higher than the minority LSE enrollment, \nindicating that ethnic minority enrollment is lower than it should be. About 1 in 5 children do not \ncomplete primary school, and about 70% of those dropouts are girls. At the secondary level, \ndropout rates are much higher in poor regions. This reflects the high contribution that education \nrequires of households. Dropout data show a gender difference that is small at the LSE level but \nbecomes much larger at the USE level. The reasons commonly given for dropping out of school \nare physical distance from school; high direct, indirect, and opportunity costs; and low quality \nand  relevance  of education.  To  increase system  efficiency  and  the  student  retention  rate, \neducation administrators must be trained to plan and manage better the limited education \nresources and to emphasize assistance policies for girls and minorities. \n \n27.  Ineffective Planning for Disadvantaged Groups. Data-gathering systems at MOET \nand DOET record total population and enrollment, but do not disaggregate data by district, \nethnicity,  or  gender.  Disaggregated  data  are  needed  for  planning  and  managing  effective \ntargeted  support  for  disadvantaged  groups.  Accurate  data  on  enrollment  patterns  from  an \neducation management information system (EMIS) will enable the cost-effective targeting of \neducation interventions. \n \n28.  Limited Accountability of Local Stakeholders. In the context of the decentralization of \nresponsibilities and resources, MOET is working to improve accountability practices to ensure \nthat resources are used efficiently and that schools and offices report the impact of such use. ", "7 \nAccountability frameworks hold schools accountable and compel the educational system to \nprovide key data for making decisions and improving outcomes. MOET\u2019s new school charter \nand  inclusive  school  development  plan  (ISDP)  requirements  are  intended  to  establish \naccountability by linking the school and the community in defining the school organization and \nactivities. ISDPs cover issues of school performance and student learning outcomes and set \nstandards for teachers. In the majority of the rural provinces, the school charter and ISDP \nprocesses are not yet participatory and seem to be undertaken more as an administrative task \nthan  as  functional  planning.  Training  administrators  and  community  representatives  and \nincreasing their awareness of the use of ISDPs will improve the efficiency, sustainability, and \naccountability of education services. \n \n2.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n29.  Many donor agencies and NGOs have been involved in the education sector since the \n1990s.  According  to  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),14 the  share  of \nhuman  resource  development  projects  generally  remained  stable  in  2003,  with  total \ndisbursements in the sector increasing to $278 million. In the past 5 years, official development \nassistance  (ODA)  funds  for  education  and  training  composed  5.5\u20136%  of  total  public \nexpenditures for education. While basic education gets the largest share of the ODA funds, all \nlevels of education, from nursery to tertiary, have received substantial assistance from donor \npartners. ADB is the principal donor in the education sector, followed by the World Bank and \nJICA. Major external assistance to the sector is summarized in Appendix 2. Improved resource \ntargeting and demand-driven initiatives will help even out the impact of the considerable funding \nof education by the Government and its partners.  \n \n30.  Multilateral  Donor  Partners.  The World Bank has supported primary, tertiary, and \nspecial education, while ADB has focused on secondary and vocational/technical education and \ntraining.  Since  2000,  World  Bank  assistance  has  dealt  primarily  with  issues  related  to \ninstitutional capacity development and decentralization of education planning and finance. The \nWorld Bank and the like-minded donor group15 have been working toward a medium-term \nexpenditure framework in primary education. UNESCO is also a key development partner in \nboth primary and secondary education. It is a focal agency for NAPEFA and for girls\u2019 education, \ncapacity  development  of  local  education  authorities,  literacy  though  adult  education,  and \nHIV/AIDS  preventive  education.  UNICEF  is  active  in  early  childhood  care  and  education, \nbilingual education for ethnic minority youth, and the introduction of \u201cchild-friendly\u201d schools. It is \nalso the lead agency for the United Nations Girls\u2019 Education Initiatives. The European Union is \nworking on the renovation of the EMIS in the primary education subsector.  \n \n31.  Bilateral Donor Partners. The Government of Japan is a key bilateral donor in the \neducation  sector.  JICA  has  been  working  mainly  on  primary  education  through  school \nconstruction and equipment provision since the early 1990s, but recently indicated a shift in \npriority from primary to secondary and tertiary education. The Japan Bank for International \nCooperation  supported  a  higher  education  project,  providing  fellowships  to  upgrade  the \nacademic qualifications of young researchers. France, another major bilateral donor, allocated \n8%  of  its  ODA  in  2002  to  education,  mainly  for  language  training,  research  studies, \nscholarships, and vocational training. Australia and Belgium have also financed scholarships \nand  have  provided  grant  assistance  to  LSE  as  cofinanciers  of  ADB  TA  projects.  The \nUnited Kingdom has similarly participated in World Bank projects as a cofinancier. \n \n                                                 \n14  UNDP Viet Nam. 2005.

Experience of ADB. As the lead donor in the education sector, ADB has a current \nproject portfolio valued at about $150 million including four ongoing loan projects, a Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant, and $110 million worth of projects in the pipeline (until \n2010), the proposed project among them. The ADB loan for teacher training (Loan 1718) has \nupgraded TTC pre-service teacher training for LSE through curriculum revision, rehabilitation of \nTTC facilities, equipment provision, and overseas training.16 The Upper Secondary Education \nDevelopment Project (Loan 1979) is aimed at expanding access to USE and improving the \nquality  of  in-service  teacher  training  for  USE  teachers.17 The  Second  Lower  Secondary \nEducation Development Project (Loan 2115), launched in March 2005,18 is improving the quality \nof LSE by developing a new assessment framework for student learning outcomes and setting \nfundamental  levels  of  quality  for  schools.  A  loan  project  approved  in  December  2006  is \nimproving pre-service teacher training for USE and professional secondary education teachers \nby  supporting  teacher  training  universities.  A  JFPR  grant  for  the  expansion  of  learning \nopportunities for ethnic minority youth (JFPR 9099) is providing scholarships and academic \nsupport to enable ethnic minority upper secondary students to attend TTCs and become LSE \nteachers in their communes.19 \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n \n33.  The key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience are that successful projects require (i) a \nresults-based  approach,  (ii)  project  site  selection,  and  (iii)  a  project  design  tailored  to  the \nspecific needs of target areas. How the proposed project incorporates these issues is discussed \nin the Special Features section of this report (paras. 59\u201362). \n \n34.  Focus on Results. Many education projects tend to set out vague project outcomes \nsuch as \u201cimproved quality of secondary education,\u201d and do not have a time-bound action plan \nwith monitoring indictors. More attention is paid to individual activities and inputs rather than to \nresults (e.g., the project outcome and impact). For this reason, although several large-scale \ninvestment projects in secondary education have been implemented successfully in Viet Nam, \ntheir impact and outcomes have no synergy and the country has not achieved universal LSE. \nThe SESMP 2006\u20132010 analysis finds that the principal policy goal of a 90% NER by 2010 can \nbe  achieved  through  more  effective  resource  mobilization  and  strategic  pedagogical \napproaches.  \n \n35.  Geographic Targeting. In previous ADB projects where targeted assistance was to be \nprovided  to  disadvantaged  areas,  the  Government  identified  disadvantaged  areas  at  the \nprovince level and with a very broad geographic spread, covering almost one third of Viet Nam\u2019s \nprovinces. The assistance, as a result, was spread too thinly\u2014within a given area it was too \nsmall  in  real  terms  to  have  significant  impact.  Survey  data  show  marked  intra-provincial \ndisparities: the education conditions in some districts belonging to relatively wealthy provinces \nare often far worse than in better-off districts in poorer provinces. However, these poor districts \nin wealthy provinces were neglected in past projects, where province-based target selection \nwas the norm. To provide substantial assistance to the most disadvantaged groups, project \nsites should be identified at the district level on the basis of an integrated assessment of \neducation, socioeconomic, and poverty indicators. \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1999.

Project \nactivities have been piecemeal, as opposed to being strategically linked. In many cases loan \nproceeds were allocated to the project components according to a \u201cbalanced percentage\u201d\u2014for \nexample, 30% of loan funds for teacher training, 25% for civil works, and 20% for equipment. \nThese were stock ratios, which were not based on the actual outputs required to produce the \ndesired results. They were used partly because education planners and teachers in remote \nareas generally had limited opportunities to participate in project design. To be more effective, \nthe  Project  will  be  better  tailored  to  local  conditions.  It  will  implement  a  well-considered \ncombination of supply- and demand-side interventions to encourage the most hard-to-reach \npopulations\u2014the Project\u2019s intended targets\u2014to participate in LSE. \n \n37.  Minimized Implementation Delay. A number of ADB\u2019s education projects have had a \nlate start-up because of delay in the declaration of loan effectiveness or the signing of the \ntechnical assistance letter. With better-harmonized procedures for project administration, the \nperformance of many projects has gradually improved. Close consultation and communication \nwith the Office of the Government, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of \nFinance,  and  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  has  helped  develop  the  executing  agencies\u2019 \nownership and commitment to smooth implementation. However, there are still delays caused \nby such factors as the slow and complex approval of procurement plans and the limited number \nof staff in the State Treasury assigned to the education sector. To ensure timely, good-quality \nimplementation, there is need for close monitoring and intensive support from the Government \nand ADB. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n38.  The Project is expected to lead to universal lower secondary education, and hence to \ngreater social and economic inclusion of disadvantaged groups. Its outcome will be improved \nNER in lower secondary education, particularly for ethnic minorities and girls, in 103 of the most \ndisadvantaged  districts  from  the  Project  provinces.20 The  first  investment  to  provide  direct \nsupport  to  the  SESMP 2006\u20132010  action  plan,  it  is  designed  to  be  synergistic  with  other \nongoing ADB education interventions in Viet Nam. The project design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 3.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n39.  To improve education outcomes for ethnic minorities and girls, the Project will have four \noutputs: (i) improved access to LSE, (ii) enhanced quality and relevance of lower secondary \neducation, (iii) pilot innovations to improve access and equity, and (iv) improved planning and \nmanagement capacity for lower secondary education in the most disadvantaged regions. \n \n  1.  Output 1: Improved Access to Lower Secondary Education \n \na.  Construction of Classrooms and Semi-Boarding Facilities \n \n40.  The primary result expected from this subcomponent is increased capacity to absorb \nstudents who now cannot attend LSSs because of lack of physical access in the target districts. \nSchools, classrooms, and semi-boarding facilities will be constructed to expand access for \n                                                 \n20  The 17 target provinces are Ca Mau, Cao Bang, Dac Lac, Dac Nong, Dien Bien, Gia Lai, Ha Giang, Kien Giang, \nKon Tum, Lai Chau, Lao Cai, Ninh Thuan, Son La, Tra Vinh, Yen Bai, Bac Kan, and Soc Trang.  \n ", "10 \nethnic minority and poor students who live in remote communes. The Project will build 819 new \nLSS classrooms with furniture for (i) new schools identified through a school mapping scheme in \nthose communes with no LSSs, or new schools built to solve the problem of long distance from \nschool;  (ii) schools  with  a  currently  high  student\u2013classroom  ratio;  (iii) schools  that  need  to \nreplace classrooms in poor condition and temporary classrooms; and (iv) newly established \nsemi-boarding schools for ethnic minorities.21 The number was determined through an in-depth \nsurvey  of  schools,  which  included  projections  of  classroom  demand  based  on  school-age \npopulation  density,  demographic  trends,  and  internal  migration  analysis.  Assuming  a \nconservatively estimated 40 students per classroom in double shifts, the Project will support \n65,500  new  places.  Considering  the  resource  gap  in  school  construction  and  general \nmaintenance  capacity  of  the  beneficiary  communities,  the  civil  works  will  meet  MOET\u2019s \nfundamental school quality level.22  \n \n41.  The Project will also construct 960 semi-boarding rooms at schools in ethnic minority \nareas, and provide furniture for these rooms. At eight students per room, the semi-boarding \nfacilities will provide spaces for 7,680 additional students, 50% of whom will be girls. Clean \nwater and sanitation facilities and cooking facilities will be included in all construction. All project \nfacilities will be \u201cgirl-friendly\u201d and will include separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys, and \nsecure rooms that maintain privacy. Many existing semi-boarding facilities are not sturdy; the \nwalls separating girls\u2019 from boys\u2019 rooms are flimsy and do not reach the ceiling. Parents worry \nabout the safety of their daughters. The semi-boarding facilities will be constructed mainly in the \nNorthern provinces and the Central Highlands, where the need is greatest. The selection of \nsites will be based on demand criteria, including the average and farthest distances that children \nlive  from  the  schools,  difficulty  of  terrain,  and  availability  of  home-stay  alternatives.  The \neducation facilities and teacher housing development plan is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nb.  Construction of Continuing Education Center Classrooms \n \n42.  Universal secondary education can be achieved only through support for both formal \nsecondary education and alternative learning opportunities for out-of-school youth not served by \nthe formal education system (including school dropouts and school leavers). The Project will \nprovide  the  first  large-scale  assistance  to  CECs,  creating  equitable  access  to  LSE  for \nout-of-school youth in disadvantaged districts by constructing, furnishing and equipping CEC \nlearning facilities. The Project will build and equip 48 new classrooms and sanitation facilities \nwhere there are none or where only poor sanitation facilities exist. At 40 students per classroom, \nthe Project will provide 1,920 new CEC spaces. Emphasis will be given to districts with a high \nproportion of out-of-school youth.  \n \n  2.  Output 2: Enhanced Quality and Relevant of Lower Secondary Education  \n \na.  Better In-Service Teacher Training \n \n43.  To enhance the quality and relevance of LSE, the Project will strengthen INSETT and \nwill draw on local expertise by selecting 170 provincial TTC lecturers for intensive training to \nbecome  core  trainers. The  core  trainers  will participate  in  the  following  training  programs: \n(i) student-centered  and  active-learning  methodologies  including  teaching  practice  and \nclass-based  student  assessment;  (ii)  mentor  training,  career  counseling,  and  continuing \n                                                 \n21  According to Prime Minister\u2019s Decision Nos. 186/2001/Q\u00a7-TTg, 168/2001/Q\u00a7-TTg and 112/2005/ Q\u00a7-TTg, there \nshould be at least one boarding school for ethnic minorities per district in the six most disadvantaged provinces in \nthe Northern Mountainous and Central Highland areas. \n22  MOET is developing three sets of standards for lower secondary schools on the basis of local financial capacity, as \nfollows: (i) international standard; (ii) national standard; and (iii) fundamental school quality level, i.e., the minimum \nstandard for facilities and teacher qualifications that all schools must meet.  ", "11 \nprofessional  development  (CPD);23 (iii)  effective  use  of  new  materials  for  disadvantaged \nstudents;  (iv)  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  the  classroom; \n(v) support for the teaching of Vietnamese to ethnic minority students and in a multicultural \nenvironment; and (vi) gender and cultural awareness programs. The core trainers will act as the \nmain resource persons and change agents. \n \n44.  The 170 core trainers will in turn train 2,900 key teachers (two from each LSS in the \n103 project districts). After this intensive training, the key teachers will disseminate the training \nto the 30,000 lower secondary teachers through cluster school\u2013based INSETT, using new \nnoncore curriculum modules and materials designed for teaching ethnic minorities and girls. Key \nteachers will also be responsible for: (i) mentoring and supporting new teachers, and (ii) working \nwith  the  school  principal  on  ISDPs.  The  Project  will  introduce  a  \u201cwhole-school  approach,\u201d \ncurrently considered best practice internationally, in which the school or cluster becomes the \ncenter for in-service activities. This approach will be embedded in school development planning \nso the school principal must support the program and have the resources to implement the plan. \n \nb.  Better Pre-service Teacher Training \n \n45.  The Project will build capacity among TTC lecturers to deliver new PRESETT modules \nto  teacher  trainees.  The  170  core  trainers  will  (i)  develop  seven  pro-poor,  ethnicity-  and \ngender-relevant PRESETT modules for use in the 17 TTCs in the target provinces; (ii) provide \ntraining based on the seven modules to 6,200 new-intake trainee teachers at their TTCs; and \n(iii) act as mentors and points of contact to maintain linkages between PRESETT and INSETT. \nSustainable  change  will  be  rooted  in  skills  development:  student  teachers  will  apply \nactive-learning methodologies first in a \u201csafe environment\u201d through micro and peer teaching and \nthen practice them in the real classroom environment. The introduction to inclusive education at \nTTCs will raise awareness of equity, gender, and ethnic minority education issues. These \nconcepts will require more than just one-off training and the principles will need to be endorsed \nat the school level in ISDPs. \n \nc.  Continuing Professional Development \n \n46.  CPD, while still a relatively new concept in Viet Nam, is a widely adopted scheme for \nlifelong career development for the teaching profession. CPD is a response to the inadequacy of \none-off training and summer courses that are insufficient in themselves to effect the transfer of \nboth knowledge and skills. It not only upgrades qualifications but continually improves and \nstrengthens teachers\u2019 professional and cognitive skills. Through CPD, the Project expects to \nensure the sustainability of training and to reduce attrition rates among teachers from remote \nschools. A CPD framework and action plan will be elaborated as part of the training of the 170 \ncore trainers. Later in the implementation phase, CPD plans will be further developed as a \nsub-module of the general PRESETT and INSETT activities, as described above.  \n \nd.  Supplementary Instructional Materials \n \n47.  Selected key teachers will work with the 170 core trainers to adapt (or develop where \nnecessary) (i) culturally appropriate and gender sensitive INSETT and PRESETT materials and \nhandouts, (ii) supplementary lesson materials for teachers, and (iii) learner support materials. \nSupplementary materials will be based on the new textbooks, with specific focus on relevant \nmaterials  for  minority  and  girl  students.  Materials  for  peer  teaching,  observation  and \nconstructive feedback, and classroom action research will also be developed. The Project will \n                                                 \n23  Traditionally, CPD was delivered through in-service courses and school events, but new strategies are being \ncreated to broaden delivery systems. In the UK, CPD includes secondments, mentoring, advanced skills courses, \nand e-networking. \n ", "12 \nprovide  overseas  and  local  training  for  instructional  material  development  and  produce \n7,900 sets of the materials. Supplementary materials for new LSE teacher trainees will cover (i) \neffective  use  of  new  textbooks,  (ii)  improvement  of  students\u2019  study  skills,  (iii) classroom \nmanagement in mixed-culture and mixed-language classes, (iv) a pupils\u2019 book for teaching \nVietnamese to ethnic minority students, and (v) bilingual material for minority students who need \nadditional support. Similar materials will be prepared for INSETT purposes and distributed to \n30,000 LSS teachers. Students\u2019 materials will be prepared and pilot-tested in schools, and \n110,000 copies (70 sets per school) will be made available throughout the 103 target districts.  \n \ne.  New Housing for Teachers \n \n48.  This subcomponent will support improvements in the quality of education by attracting \nmore qualified and experienced teachers to remote minority schools through the provision of \nteacher housing facilities. The survey showed that among financial and nonfinancial incentives \nfor teachers, the availability of teacher housing exerts the strongest positive influence on the \ndecision of qualified teachers to work in remote schools. Conversely, the lack of decent teacher \nhousing is a key reason for the high attrition rates among teachers in minority areas. The \nProject will construct dwellings for 867 teachers, single as well as married, to encourage teacher \nretention in the remote regions. Basic facilities will include separate sanitation facilities, cooking \nfacilities, and water storage tanks. The construction of teacher housing will be prioritized in the \nmost  remote  schools  where  semi-boarding  facilities  will  be  provided.  This  will  ensure  that \nresponsible adults are always on hand wherever there are semi-boarding students. Eligibility of \nteachers will follow government regulations, but priority will be given to female and ethnic \nminority teachers. The school will own the housing and will make it available to teachers \nrent-free for as long as they remain at the school. The right of occupation will revert to the \nschool once the teachers retire or otherwise leave the school.  \n \nf.  New Laboratories and Libraries \n \n49.  The Project will construct and equip 180 libraries and 112 laboratories at selected LSSs \nand CECs where such educational resource facilities are currently unavailable. These facilities \nwill contribute to improving the quality of teaching and the learning outcomes of the minority \nstudents. The facilities will also serve as function rooms for awareness-raising activities, teacher \ntraining workshops, and community events. Communities and parent-teacher associations of \ntarget schools will receive maintenance manuals.  \n \ng.  Information and Communication Technology Applications in the \nEducation of Girls and Ethnic Minorities \n \n50.  Though the main focus of ICT activities will be on the use of ICT for the development of \nmanagerial and planning capacity, the Project will also promote the effective use of ICT for \nteaching in disadvantaged regions. This subcomponent will support better access to educational \nresources through ICT for teachers in remote areas. Web-based instructional materials will be \ndeveloped. The Project will provide pilot ICT facilities for networking with TTCs and selected \nethnic minority schools. Through this e-mentoring network, TTCs will help teachers in remote \nschools to strengthen their pedagogical skills\u2014teaching, coaching, and mentoring adolescents \nand guiding minority students in making career choices and in dealing with such issues as \nlanguage barriers, low self-esteem, drugs and smoking, and early marriage and pregnancy.  \n \nh.  Scholarship Program for Teacher Training for Minority Students  \n \n51.  The \u201cnew transitional program\u201d is a package of assistance in support of the development \nof ethnic minority students in upper secondary school into lower secondary teachers in their own ", "13 \ncommunities. Priority will be given to the teaching of ethnic minority languages and subjects that \nare in short supply in remote areas. The program was pilot-tested under a JFPR grant (see \nfootnote 19), and the lessons learned\u2014such as that the financial support should extend over the \nentire 3 years of TTC to encourage completion\u2014will feed into the expansion and scaling-up \neffort under the Project. The Project will provide 250 minority students (50% of these, girls) with \n(i) an academic preparatory course (1 year) and (ii) financial support of $455 per year for 4 \nyears, for textbooks and food. Scholarship recipients are expected to become teachers who, \nwith their understanding of their own minority languages and culture, can be successful role \nmodels  for  ethnic  minority  youth.  Minority  teachers  are  more  likely  to  return  to  their  own \ncommunities to work.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Pilot Innovations to Improve Access and Equity for Minorities and \nGirls to Lower Secondary Education \n \na.  Pilot Scholarship Program for Ethnic Minorities  \n \n52.  The Project will provide 4-year scholarships to 800 students from the 18 smallest ethnic \nminority groups to improve access to and completion of LSE for the neediest students (see \nfootnote 5). The scholarship scheme will help in the successful transition of grade 5 minority \nstudents from primary to lower secondary level. In this pilot phase, target students will receive \nfinancial support of $200 per year for the duration of LSS, and dropout rates will be monitored. \nThis subcomponent will serve as a basis for policy dialogue with the Government on the \ncountry\u2019s future scholarship policy. The impact of this financial support and its ability to attract \nminority students to upper levels of education will be assessed. The Project will organize a \nnational workshop to disseminate the results of the pilot program and will help the Government \nfurther develop policy options for scholarship schemes, including tuition exemption and student \nloans. The scholarship program plan is in Appendix 4. \n \nb.  Public Awareness Campaign to Promote Lower Secondary \nEducation \n \n53.  The Project will address demand-side issues in education in ethnic minority areas by \nraising public awareness of the importance and value of lower secondary schooling, particularly \nfor girls. These demand-side activities will be targeted at parents, commune and village leaders, \neducation planners, and students, and will use a combination of approaches including: (i) print \nmedia such as posters, discussion cards, and stickers; (ii) mass media including radio and \ncommune broadcasting and village meetings; and (iii) promotional activities at local community \nand  school  events.  The  CECs  will  play  a  central  role  in  the  campaign  activities.  The \nawareness-raising activity plan is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n  \nc.  Pilot Semi-Boarding School Feeding Program \n \n54.  This subcomponent will ensure that all students in semi-boarding facilities have adequate \nnutrition during the food-scarce preharvest months. Currently, children in semi-boarding facilities \nmust bring their own food from home and cook their own meals. In practice, many poor students \nsubsist on little more than rice, and even rice becomes scarce particularly in the preharvest \nmonths. Seasonal poverty is at its peak during this time, and nearly two thirds of all ethnic \nminorities have incomes below the poverty line even under normal circumstances. The school \nfeeding program for semi-boarders will provide 15 kilograms of rice per student per month for \n3 months over 4 years. It will reduce the burden on parents to provide food during the season \nwhen food is most scarce, encourage children from poor minorities to attend school and reduce \nattrition, and improve educational outcomes, as well-nourished children are better able to learn. \n \n \n ", "14 \nd.  Research Studies on Pilot Innovations \n \n55.  MOET will commission four research studies to evaluate the innovative pilot initiatives \nunder  Output  3  \u2014scholarships,  awareness-raising  activities  and  school  feeding.  Research \ninstitutes and universities will conduct the studies with the assistance of the international ethnic \nminority education adviser. The national project implementation unit (NPIU) will develop and \nsubmit a detailed research study plan to ADB, but the overall emphasis will be on examining the \ndemand side of ethnic minority education (i.e., the efficacy of interventions that encourage \nschool enrollments and retention of the hardest-to-reach populations, complementing supply-\nside interventions such as building physical facilities). NPIU will post the research findings on \nthe project website. The results will be used in refining the related subcomponents such as the \nscholarship program, INSETT, and educational planning training. \n \n4.  Output 4: Improved Planning and Managing Capacity for Lower Secondary \nEducation in the Most Disadvantaged Regions \n \na.  Capacity Development for Education Planning and Management \n \n56.  The Project will complement MOET\u2019s ongoing capacity development initiatives in general \neducation planning and management. The focus will be on the planning and management \nneeds of schools in remote and disadvantaged areas, where more flexible approaches and \ngreater community involvement are required. The Project will introduce performance-based \nmanagement training for school principals and staff of the BOETs, DOETs, and MOET. The \ngoal  is  to  promote  better  planning  at  the  start  of  the  school  cycle;  greater  transparency, \nconsistency, and fairness in assessment; and wider access to CPD. School principals will \nreceive leadership framework training to enable them to develop ISDPs and carry out their \nschool charter, neither of which is fully functional at present. The Project will train 1,450 school \nprincipals as well as 150 BOET, DOET, and MOET staff in planning and managing targeted \nassistance for disadvantaged groups. In addition, 25 MOET staff will have the opportunity to \nundergo overseas training within the region to learn from international best practices in policy \nplanning for disadvantaged groups. \n \nb.  School-Based Education Management Information System for Ethnic \nMinorities \n \n57.  This subcomponent will help secondary school principals and their staff to develop \nISDPs and apply their school charter to school-based monitoring and planning. ADB\u2019s Upper \nSecondary Education Development Project is currently pilot-testing a student-based EMIS for \nvulnerable  children.  This  subcomponent  will  carefully  review  the  results  and  scale  up  the \nstudent-based EMIS to cover the target schools that have access to electricity and to ICT \ntraining. The school-based EMIS will capture detailed gender- and ethnicity-disaggregated data \nto support effective planning and management for targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups. \nSchools and BOETs will receive hardware, software, and training to implement this component. \nThe training will also be made available to relevant MOET, DOET, BOET, and TTC staff.  \n \nc.  Project Implementation and Administration Support \n \n58.  The  Project  will  provide  implementation  support  to  NPIU  and  other  implementing \npartners through consulting services, procurement of equipment and materials, and operational \ncosts  and  logistics.  A  project  implementation  network  will  be  established  among  NPIU, \nprovincial project implementation units (PPIUs), and district coordination committees comprising \nthe target districts and communes together with relevant schools and the BOETs. Provincial and \ndistrict  people\u2019s  committees  will  also  play  an  important  role  in  civil  works  processing  and ", "15 \nawareness-raising activities, though overall responsibility for civil works will lie with the DOET \ndirectors.  This  subcomponent  will  support  reporting  requirements\u2014including  annual  audit \nreporting, and review and monitoring requirements\u2014and capacity development workshops and \nseminars that are not covered under other subcomponents. The tracer study on the beneficiary \nlower secondary school graduates will be undertaken.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n59.  Results-Oriented  Approach.  The  Project  has  a  strong  results  orientation,  with \ntime-bound monitoring indicators developed and agreed on by the Government and other donor \npartners in SESMP 2006\u20132010. The Project has a clearly stated and measurable expected \nimpact and outcome. All component activities are designed to directly address the identified \nconstraints on universal secondary education in the most disadvantaged regions, and will be \ntracked with the use of the results-based monitoring framework in Appendix 5.  \n \n60.  Geographic  Targeting.  The  Project  developed  a  rigorous  selection  procedure  for \nidentifying and targeting the most disadvantaged districts and schools. District-based selection \nis an innovative design approach for education sector projects in Viet Nam. Intensive social and \npoverty analysis was undertaken to select the target districts. Districts were evaluated and \nranked according to (i) socioeconomic indicators including average per capita income, poverty \nincidence, MDGs, minority population ratio, ratio of minorities in the 11\u201314 age range to whole \npopulation in that age range, Gini coefficient for education,24 proportion of households belonging \nto the bottom income quintile, and unemployment rate; (ii) education indicators including gross \nenrollment rate and net enrollment rate, disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and household \nincomes  where  possible,  dropout  rate,  cohort  survival  rate,  average  learning  outcomes  at \nnational  examinations,  average  commuting  distance  to  schools,  average  qualification  of \nteachers,  teacher\u2013student  ratio,  average  number  of  textbooks  per  student,  financial \nsustainability of education expenditures of local authorities, and percentage of double- and \ntriple-shift classes; and (iii) other factors such as the availability of government or donor support, \ngeographic balance, priority for natural disaster-prone regions, and priority for provinces that \nhave never received support from education projects. The detailed selection methodology is in \nAppendix 6 and a brief profile of each of the 103 target districts in the 17 provinces is in \nAppendix 7. \n \n61.  Activities Tailored to Local Needs. To identify the actual needs of each target district \nand  to  encourage  ownership  by  local  stakeholders,  a  questionnaire-based  survey  and  a \nreferendum  on  proposed  activities  were  undertaken  with  MOET,  DOET,  and  BOET\u2014a \nconsultation procedure similar to that adopted by Viet Nam\u2019s line ministries. The survey results \nconfirmed a high degree of approval (more than 90%) from the target districts for the proposed \ncore activities. Hence, project activities are tailored to the expressed needs of target districts. \nThe extensive consultation process contributed greatly to generating commitment and project \nownership from local stakeholders at the central and district levels.  \n \n62.  Innovative Approaches. The Project will implement several innovative approaches to \nimproving  educational  access  and  equity  for  ethnic  minorities  and  girls.  Some  of  these \napproaches  are  being  pilot-tested  under  other  ADB-funded  projects;  others  will  build  on \ninternational experience. Technical innovations to focus support where it will be most effective in \nmeeting the real needs of disadvantaged groups include assistance to CECs, construction of \nteacher  housing  and  school  semi-boarding  facilities,  scholarships  for  minority  students  to \nsupport the transition from primary education through LSE to USE, scholarships to TTCs for \nethnic  minorities,  a  school  feeding  program,  and  awareness-raising  activities  for  minority \n                                                 \n24  The education Gini coefficient is a measure of distributive educational attainment that reflects education inequality. \n ", "16 \nparents and communities. Pedagogical innovations to make secondary education more relevant \nand interesting to girls and ethnic minorities include Vietnamese language teaching for children \nwhose mother tongue is not Vietnamese, and development of teachers\u2019 classroom skills and \ncareer planning through INSETT and CPD. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n63.  The project cost is estimated at $64 million equivalent, including $1.65 million equivalent \nin taxes and duties, and $5.98 million equivalent in physical and price contingencies. The costs \nare summarized in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n \n64.  The Government of Viet Nam has requested a loan of $50 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate charge of 1% per year during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  year  after  that.  ADB  will  finance  78.1%  of  the  project  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  counterpart  financing  for  the  remaining  21.9%,  or  $14  million \nequivalent\u2014$9.9 million equivalent (15.5%) from the central budget, and $4.1 million equivalent \n(6.4%) from provincial budgets\u2014for land acquisition, maintenance of facilities, and equipment to \nbe procured under the Project.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n65.  Project Management. In line with Decree 131, MOET will take the role of \u201cproject owner\u201d \nand will be responsible for both overall project management and guidance as the Executing \nAgency (EA). An NPIU will be established in MOET to oversee day-to-day project implementation. \nThe NPIU will comprise the project manager, a deputy project manager, and key technical staff, \nincluding  finance,  procurement,  civil  works,  staff  development,  social  and  community \ndevelopment, and ICT/EMIS experts. Each of the 17 target provinces will establish a PPIU in the \nDOET. DOET directors will bear responsibility for civil works. PPIUs will obtain approval for all civil \nworks activities from the relevant provincial people\u2019s committees and district people\u2019s committees. \nThe PPIUs will be responsible for implementing, coordinating, monitoring, and reporting activities \nat the provincial level under NPIU instruction and guidance. PIUs are appointed by government, \nand all their recurrent costs will be borne by government. The district coordination committees will \ncollaborate with communities and local leaders in participatory planning and awareness raising in \nthe target districts, and will be responsible for implementing and supervising project activities in \nschools and coordinating with DOETs. A chart showing the project organization structure and \nrelationships is in Appendix 9. \n \n66.  Implementation Period. The Project will be implemented over 6 years, from June 2008 \nto June 2014. The closing date for loan utilization will be 31 December 2014. The Government \nhas given its assurance that adequate budgetary provision for the Project will be included in the \n2007/2008 fiscal year budget. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n67.  Procurement.  ADB-financed goods and works will be procured according to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The NPIU, in close cooperation \nwith relevant PPIUs and BOETs, will be responsible for all procurement. National competitive \nbidding consistent with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines will be carried out. Modifications and \nclarifications  that  need  to  be  made  regarding  the  Borrower\u2019s  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures must be agreed on by ADB and the Borrower. Given the broad geographic range of \nthe Project, and the resulting high number of relatively small contract packages anticipated, all \ncivil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding.  An  indicative \nprocurement plan and packages for 18 months are in Appendix 11. \n \n68.  Contracts for goods estimated at $1 million equivalent or more will be awarded through \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  and  those  for  goods  (other  than  instructional  materials) \nestimated at less than $1 million but more than $100,000 equivalent through national competitive \nbidding. Contracts estimated at less than $100,000 equivalent will follow shopping procedures. \nInstructional materials will be procured through national competitive bidding or direct contracting.25 \nAwareness-raising materials will be procured through least-cost selection. Details of procurement \n                                                 \n25 Some kinds of instructional material produced by the Education Publishing House can be procured through direct \ncontracting with Education Publishing House if the publishing house retains copyright of the materials. \n ", "18 \npackages and technical specifications will be submitted to ADB for approval before procurement. \nMOET will take advance procurement action for the recruitment of individual consultants in the \ncase  of  the  international  project  facilitation  adviser  and  the  national  project  facilitation  and \nmanagement adviser, to expedite implementation. ADB\u2019s concurrence to advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance related expenditure under the Project or to finance the Project.  \n \n69.  Consulting  Services.  The  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  489  person-months  of \nconsulting  services\u201474  international  and  415  national.  The  international  consultants  will \ncomprise experts in project facilitation (3 person-months), education planning and management \n(18; this consultant will also be the team leader), procurement (14), resettlement (1), teacher \ntraining design and planning (16), ICT (4), gender and ethnic minority education planning (8), \nmonitoring and evaluation (6), and scholarship policy and planning (4). The national consultants \nwill have expertise in national civil works and procurement (48 person-months), construction \nsupervision (51), resettlement (10), school-based INSETT (24), pro-poor PRESETT (48), ethnic \nminority education management (48), gender education management (24), scholarship policy \nand  management  (48),  project  facilitation  and  management  (12),  education  planning  (26), \neducation management and administration (52), ICT/EMIS management (12), and monitoring \nand quality control (12). The consulting services are summarized in Appendix 12 and described \nin  detail  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The  overseas  training  will  be  provided  by  an \ninternational training provider, which will be selected through consultant qualification. Detailed \nterms of reference and selection criteria for the overseas training provider will be developed by \nNPIU with the assistance of international consultants during implementation. \n \n70.  The international and national consultants to be financed under the Project will be selected \nand hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). For smooth start-up, the project facilitation adviser will be selected and hired individually to \nhelp NPIU develop a solid implementation framework. The remaining services will be provided by an \ninternational firm, to be selected and hired through quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS). The \nQCBS weighting will follow the standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20.  \n \n71.  Staff Development. The beneficiary schools and BOETs will select participants for the \nin-country training. Female and ethnic minority teachers and administrators will be given priority \nwhen training opportunities arise. For the overseas training, the NPIU will draw up the criteria for \nthe selection of participants and a list of candidates and submit these to ADB for review and \napproval. The indicators for quality assurance of training content and management, and plan for \ndissemination by the training participants, will be developed and submitted to ADB. Details of all \nthe  teacher  training,  ICT  training,  and  educational  planning  and  management  training  are \nincluded in the staff development plan in Appendix 13.  \n \n72.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any allegations of corruption, fraud, collusion, or coercion relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be \nincluded in the Loan Agreement and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will specify the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. In addition to these \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency, the Government  will disclose \ninformation about public procurement, including that related to the Project, on the procurement \nwebsite. For each contract, the list of participating bidders, the name of the winning bidder, \nbasic details on the bidding procedures adopted, the amount of the contract award, and the list \nof goods and services procured, among other things, will be found on the website.  ", "19 \n \n73.  Disbursement Arrangements. The ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed according to \nthe procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo speed up project implementation through the timely release of loan proceeds for eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank chosen by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The ceiling of the account \nand the initial amount deposited in it will not exceed $2 million equivalent. The imprest account \nwill  be  managed  and  administered  by  the  NPIU.  The  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure may be used when seeking reimbursement of eligible expenditures and liquidating \nadvances made into the imprest account according to the guidelines. Each payment to be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the SOE will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. The project \nfunds flow arrangement is in Appendix 14. \n \n74.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  MOET,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will \nmaintain separate records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and services financed \nfrom the loan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, and SOE and imprest \naccount records, will be audited yearly by independent external auditors selected through a \ncompetitive procedure acceptable to ADB, according to the provisions of the Loan Agreement. \nThe auditors\u2019 services will be financed from the loan proceeds. The audit report and copies of \nthe certified accounts and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB no later than \n6 months after each fiscal year. The audit report will include the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of \nloan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use of the imprest account under \nADB\u2019s SOE procedure. The NPIU will prepare monthly reports on project implementation and \nsubmit them to ADB. These reports, which will include data on the implementation targets and \ntheir fulfillment, problems and constraints faced, and proposed actions and solutions, will be \nsubmitted  in  English,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB.  Within  3 months  after  the  physical \ncompletion of the Project, the NPIU will submit to ADB a project completion report providing \ndetails of project implementation, accomplishments, and impact. \n \n75.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. To monitor the progress made by \nthe  Project  in  achieving  the  outcome,  MOET/NPIU  will  establish  a  project  performance \nmonitoring system using the results-based monitoring indicators from SESMP 2006\u20132010 with \nbaseline information from MOET\u2019s existing benefit monitoring and evaluation system. \n \n76.  Project Review. The Government and ADB will undertake joint reviews of the Project \nevery 6 months. The reviews will assess progress in component activities, the quality of activities \nand the outputs produced, the performance of the Project and its stakeholders, and the status of \ncompliance with loan covenants; identify issues and challenges; and provide management and \ntechnical advice and support. In the third year of the Project, the Government and ADB will \nconduct a midterm review covering a comprehensive assessment of achievements against the \nProject\u2019s  expected  impact  and  outcomes,  the  identification  of  possible  loan  savings  and \nreallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  and  the  modification  of  implementation  arrangements  where \nnecessary for the successful completion of the Project. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impact \n \n77.  Direct Beneficiaries. The direct beneficiaries will be the whole LSE-eligible cohort in the \n103 target districts (totaling about 700,000 children aged 11\u201314), who will have better access to \nLSE and good-quality teaching and learning. Output 1 will create more than 65,500 new lower \nsecondary school places and 1,920 new CEC places through the construction of classrooms. \nOutput 2 will train 170 core trainers from TTCs and 2,900 key teachers from LSSs and CECs to \n ", "20 \ndevelop minority-focused modules and materials and active-learning teaching methodology. The \nPRESETT courses will cover 6,200 new intake of lower secondary teacher trainees, and 30,000 \nlower secondary teachers will receive cluster school\u2013based INSETT and CPD. More than 8,000 \nstudents, of whom at least half will be girls, will have access to improved semi-boarding facilities \nincluding food support in the preharvest season, and 867 teachers (and their families) will \nbenefit from better living conditions in improved teacher housing. Scholarships will be extended \nto 250 ethnic minority TTC students in Output 2, as well as to 800 most needy ethnic minority \nLSS students in Output 3. Output 4 will provide educational planning and management training \nto 1,450 LSS principals and 140 administrators.  \n \n78.  Educational Benefits. The Project will have a substantial strategic impact on the three \nkey dimensions of secondary education in the most disadvantaged regions: access and equity, \nquality and relevance, and efficiency and sustainability. The direct benefits to the sector will \naccrue from (i) significantly narrowed gaps in access to secondary schooling between ethnic, \ngender, and socioeconomic groups, (ii) teaching and learning that is more relevant and more \nresponsive to local demands, and (iii) strengthened capacity of local education authorities to \nplan,  deliver,  and  manage  education  services.  The  Project  will  introduce,  through  the \nwhole-school approach, innovative and international best practice pedagogical concepts such \nas  CPD,  student-centered  active-learning  methods,  and  cluster  school-based  INSETT. \nEducation planning and management will benefit from improved efficiency. Internal efficiency \nwill increase through reduced pupil repetition and dropout rates as well as reduced teacher \nturnover  (a  result  of  improved  teacher  housing).  Learning  support  through  supplementary \ninstructional materials in ethnic minority languages and awareness-raising activities will improve \nlearning outcomes and lower the dropout rate.  \n \n79.  Social  Benefits.  The Project will give the lower secondary school cohort of  about \n700,000 ethnic minority and poor students the immediate benefit of a better education. Key \nsocial benefits will accrue from significantly narrowed gaps in access to secondary education \nbetween ethnic and gender groups. The Project will make participation in secondary education \nmore attractive to ethnic minorities and girls by (i) reducing the physical distance to schools; \n(ii) providing more semi-boarding facilities, school feeding programs, and separate sanitation \nfacilities for males and females in schools; (iii) awarding scholarships for LSE and TTCs; and \n(iv) improving teacher training and making it more student-centered and responsive to gender \nand cultural diversity. These initiatives are aimed at addressing some of the demand-side issues \nand alleviating the direct and indirect costs of education. In addition, more ethnic minority \nteachers, particularly females, will be positive role models for ethnic minority students and will \ndemonstrate  the  tangible  output  of  education.  A  stable  supply  of  qualified  ethnic  minority \nteachers  to  remote  minority  schools  will  help  preserve  minority  languages  and  cultures. \nCommunity  awareness-raising  activities  will  focus  on  demonstrating  the  benefits  of  school \nparticipation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15. \n \n80.  There  are  considerable  and  well-documented  gains  to  society  from  improved \neducational  attainment,  and  social  benefits  are  most  profound  where  girls\u2019  education  is \nimproved. The empirical record demonstrates that educated girls have reduced fertility rates, \nprovide better nutrition for their families, and are more likely to use health services. Educated \nmothers  are  more  likely  to  send  their  own  daughters  to  school,  thus  breaking  the \nintergenerational transmission of poverty. Educated young people are better prepared to enter \nthe  labor  market  and  have  increased  earning  potential.  Household  income  is  positively \ncorrelated with mean years of schooling, and education reduces child labor. To maximize the \nsocial  benefits  of  the  Project,  a  specific  gender  and  ethnic  minority  action  plan  will  be \nimplemented and monitored. Elements of the plan have been mainstreamed in the project \ndesign  and  targets  are  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  in  the  loan \nassurances. A gender and ethnic minority action plan (GEMAP) is in Appendix 16. ", "21 \n \n81.  Economic Benefits. The major economic benefits of the Project will be as follows: \n(i) increased  numbers  and  enhanced  productivity  of  secondary  school  graduates,  and \n(ii) improved efficiency of infrastructure, personnel, and resource allocation. The Project will also \nhave  these  other  economic  benefits:  (i)  an  increase  in  the  number  of  secondary  school \ngraduates and participants in the labor market to more than 500,000 yearly; (ii) higher academic \nstandards of beneficiaries, helping align the skills of graduates with the market; (iii) improved \nearning capacity of low-income groups, helping reduce poverty; (iv) improved cost-effectiveness \nthrough  increased  capacity  utilization  of  LSSs,  reducing  the  unit  cost  and  strengthening \nmanagement; and (v) anticipated cumulative savings of about 0.5% of the annual recurrent \ncosts of secondary education. A summary economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n82.  Involuntary Resettlement. All civil works will take place on existing school grounds or \non government-owned land, and land acquisition and resettlement will not be necessary. New \nschools will be built on vacant public land or commune reserve land. Before the award of civil \nworks contracts the PPIUs will check in each case that these procedures are followed and \nprovide  a  written  report  with  contract  documentation  for  ADB\u2019s  endorsement.  ADB  review \nmissions will make spot checks to ensure that the community site selection process has been \nfollowed.  However,  since  not  all  civil  works  sites  have  been  determined,  a  resettlement \nframework has been developed in accordance with Government Decree No. 197/2004/ND-CP \n(issued  on  3  December  2004)  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The \nframework will guide development resettlement plans, if required, under the Project. A summary \nresettlement framework is in Appendix 17. \n \n83.  Environment.  No negative environmental impact from the Project is foreseen. The \nProject is therefore categorized as environmental category C. \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n \n84.  Demand  for  Education. One of the risks of an education project that is aimed at \nreaching the most excluded students with new school buildings and physical facilities is that, \ndespite the facilities, demand for education will remain low. To mitigate this risk, the Project has \nbeen designed to balance supply-side interventions\u2014building schools and teacher and student \naccommodation  facilities,  strengthening  teaching  staff,  etc.\u2014with  demand-side  actions. \nRecognizing that for many remotely located ethnic minority families, demand for secondary \neducation  is  very  low,  the  Project  will  implement  a  number  of  demand-side  interventions, \nincluding scholarship programs, a school feeding program in the lean season, and a public \nawareness campaign to promote the benefits of education.  \n \n85.  Teacher Retention. In remote schools in the poorest areas, there will always be the risk \nof low teacher retention. New teachers often put in the required time at remote schools and \nleave as soon as possible while the MOET provides them with a slightly higher allowance than \nthe salaries at more accessible schools. The Project will mitigate one of the main reasons for \nteacher departure, namely, poor-quality teacher housing. New housing facilities with separate \nsanitation facilities, new kitchens, and space for families will encourage teacher retention in \nremote areas. Creating additional incentives for teachers, such as higher salaries or allowances \nfor posts in remote areas, will be the subject of ongoing policy dialogue under the Project.  \n \n86.  Sustainability. Improving the accessibility and quality of education for ethnic minorities \nwill  consume  more  resources  and  higher-than-average  education  expenditure  per  capita. \nProvinces with a high proportion of economically disadvantaged ethnic minorities will not have \nthe same capacity to pay for education as those in more economically advantaged areas. \nBudget support or targeted assistance (or both) is the only way that these provinces can \n ", "22 \nachieve national education goals. Since a majority of the ethnic minorities still live in poverty, \nmany  below  the  poverty  line,  government  policies  such  as  targeted  scholarships,  fee \nexemptions, and other subsidies for ethnic minorities must continue in the medium term. Lower \nsecondary semi-boarding facilities will be required until the LSS network has been sufficiently \nexpanded into remote communes. Investments will be needed to improve the quality of boarding \nfacilities (satisfactory sanitation and cooking facilities) and educational facilities (classrooms and \nequipment),  provide  more  strategic  teacher  training,  and  develop  appropriate  instructional \nmaterials for ethnic minority groups and disadvantaged districts.  \n \n87.  A drop in the recurrent budget allocations for teachers\u2019 salaries and the operation and \nmaintenance of education facilities is a medium-term risk, since the Project specifically targets \nrevenue-poor districts and disadvantaged students. The financial contributions expected from the \nbeneficiaries,  to  sustain  project  outputs,  will  be  limited.  However,  analysis  indicates  the \nGovernment\u2019s  sustained  commitment  to  education  in  budgetary  allocations.  In  2006  public \nexpenditure on education reached 20% of total public expenditure. Budget allocation norms cover \neducation expenditures based on the school-age cohort with adjustments made for each region \n(Resolution No. 47/2006/QH11 of the 11th National Assembly 2006 on the National Budget). The \nProject must assume that education will continue to be a priority sector, as set out in SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010 and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, and that support for \ntargeted and special assistance programs for disadvantaged students will be sustained, toward \nthe achievement of universal LSE targets. Further, the Project is pilot-testing several initiatives to \nassist the Government in developing policy options for scholarships and tuition exemptions. \nTherefore, the risk to the sustainability of the project outcome is reduced. \n \n88.  Fiscal Impact. The fiscal impact of the Project is assessed to be limited throughout and \nafter the project period on the following assumptions: (i) education and training expenditure is \nmaintained  at  the  current  5\u20136%  of  GDP  in  accordance  with  government  commitments; \n(ii) expenditure  for  secondary  education  is  maintained  at  32%  of  education  and  training \nexpenditures; (iii) capital costs and recurrent costs (including salaries and operating cost) are \nstable; and (iv) education expenditures will increasingly be focused on universal education in \nethnic minority and disadvantaged areas, where community contributions will be limited. The \nrecurrent costs to be borne by the Government after the Project are estimated at $650,000 per \nyear  and  include  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  new  and  replaced  school  facilities, \nequipment, semi-boarding facilities, and teacher housing. The estimated annual recurrent costs \nafter project implementation account for 0.13% of the secondary education operating cost in \n2013\u20132020. This level of costs is sustainable, given the size of the projected education budget. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n89.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation requests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds \nduring each year of project implementation. \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that (a) new school and sanitation facilities are \nconstructed on vacant land, which will not invoke involuntary resettlement as \ndefined  by  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  that  during \ndetailed design every effort is made to avoid relocating households or interfering ", "23 \nin the income-earning activities of those at or near the site; (b) if any land is to be \nacquired  for  construction  of  facilities  or  if  there  is  any  impact  on  persons \noccupying  or  using  land  at  the  construction  site  that  would  necessitate \ncompensation,  a  resettlement  plan,  acceptable  to  ADB,  is  prepared  in \naccordance with the resettlement framework, applicable laws and regulations of \nthe Government, and requirements of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, \nand  in  full  consultation  with  and  disclosure  to  the  affected  people;  (c)  a \nresettlement plan is prepared on the basis of detailed technical designs, in full \nconsultation with and disclosure to the affected people prior to submission to \nADB for review and approval; and (d) land acquisition and resettlement activities \nare implemented in accordance with the terms of the approved resettlement \nplans, applicable laws and regulations of the Borrower, and requirements of \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. In case of discrepancies between the \nGovernment\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB's  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, ADB\u2019s policy shall prevail. \n \n(iii)  The Government will also ensure, and cause MOET and the PPIUs to ensure, \nthat  (a) special  measures  and  complementary  mitigation  and  enhancement \nactivities  are  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plans  to  protect  socially  and \neconomically vulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment, such \nas those without legal title to land or other assets, ethnic minorities, households \nheaded by women, children, the disabled or elderly, and the poorest people; and \n(b) appropriate  assistance  is  provided  to  help  such  groups  improve  their \nsocioeconomic status such as land-for-land, replacement housing of minimum \nstandard, and increased security of tenure. \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that civil works contractors are not issued a notice of \npossession for a site until (a) compensation payment and relocation to new sites \nhave  been  satisfactorily  completed  for  such  site,  (b)  agreed  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place, and (c) the site is free of all encumbrances. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure, and cause MOET and the PPIUs to ensure, that the \nproject  activities  do  not  adversely  affect  ethnic  minorities,  female-headed \nhouseholds, the disabled, the elderly, or other similarly vulnerable groups, and \nthat  the  Project  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  GEMAP,  which  has  been \nprepared  and  agreed  on  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  sufficient \nresources have been allocated for its effective and timely implementation. \n \n(vi)  The  Government  will  establish,  by  the  end  of  year  2  of  the  Project,  a \nstudent-based EMIS, which will enable the tracking of lower secondary graduates \nin both higher education and the work environment and generate feedback for \nimproving the management and implementation of lower secondary education. \n \n(vii)  The Government will ensure, and cause MOET and PPIUs to ensure, that the \nDOETs  actively  promote  and  undertake  full  community  participation  in  the \nselection and preparation of the school construction sites prior to and during the \nconstruction of the schools and related facilities. \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the scholarships are provided and the teachers \nare selected for study tours in accordance with the selection criteria to be agreed \non between the Government and ADB. \n \n(ix)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, MOET will  \n ", "24 \n \n(a)  cause a PPIU to be established in each of the 17 project provinces and \nnotify ADB by submission of a list of all PPIU members; \n(b)  submit to ADB an official commitment to be provided by each of the 17 \nproject provinces to provide the necessary financial and human resources \nto  ensure  the  effective  and  timely  operation  and  maintenance  of  the \nproject facilities, including equipment provided under the Project; \n(c)  submit to ADB a list of the names and locations of the designated LSSs \nand CECs to be supported; \n(d)  identify the first year of the school construction and replacement program; \nand \n(e)  submit to ADB a list of the civil works sites and details of land ownership \nthat  confirm  the  avoidance  of  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement impact in the 17 project provinces. \n \n(x)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, MOET will \n(a)  establish and submit to ADB for approval, criteria for selecting candidates \nfor in-country and overseas training or study tours, of whom 50% are \nfemale; \n(b)  establish and submit to ADB for approval, criteria for selecting candidates \nfor scholarships, of whom 50% are female; \n(c)  establish  and  submit  to  ADB  for  approval,  the  baseline  data  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  indicators,  paying  particular  attention  to \ngender-disaggregated data; and \n(d)  establish  quotas  for  females  (at  least  50%)  for  the  semi-boarding \nfacilities, scholarship, teacher housing, and transitional program. \n \n(xi)  MOET will design, construct, and operate the physical facilities to be upgraded or \nconstructed under the Project in line with the Government\u2019s environmental laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). In case of discrepancies \nbetween  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB's \nEnvironment Policy, ADB's policy will prevail. \n \n(xii)  Labor Issues. The Government will ensure, and cause MOET and the PPIUs to \nensure,  that  bidding  documents  include  provisions  to  ensure  (i)  contractors' \npreferential hiring of local labor; (ii) equal opportunities are guaranteed for female \nworkers to work with the principle of equal pay for work of equal value; and (iii) \nnecessary  measures  are  taken  to  prevent  employment  of  child  labor,  in \ncompliance with the relevant rules and regulations of the Borrower.  \n \n(xiii)  Affected People. The Government will ensure, and cause MOET and the PPIUs \nto ensure, that implementation of the resettlement plans are carried out with the \nfull participation of the Affected People. The comments and suggestions of the \nAffected People and communities will be taken into account during the design and \nimplementation phases of the resettlement activities. To ensure that all grievances \nof  the  Affected  People  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation, and determination and payment of entitlements are resolved in a timely \nand satisfactory manner, and that all avenues for airing grievances are available \nto the Affected People, the Government will set up a mechanism under the Project \nto deal with any such grievances during Project implementation. ", "25 \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n90.  The  Government,  through  MOET,  will  have  established  and  set  up  the  NPIU  and \nappointed  a  full-time  project  manager,  a  deputy  project  manager  and  key  technical  staff \nincluding  an  appropriate  number  of  experts  in  finance,  procurement,  civil  works,  staff \ndevelopment,  social  and  community  development,  and  ICT  and/or  education  management \ninformation systems, whose experience and qualifications are acceptable to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n91.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR31,860,000 to the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam for the Lower Secondary Education for the Most Disadvantaged Regions Project from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President  \n16 November 2007 \n ", "26  Appendix 2   \nANALYSIS OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR \n1.  Sector Overview. In Viet Nam, education is viewed as strongly linked to economic growth \nand it has been accorded priority as a principal investment option for long-term socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  The  central  pillar  of  the  national  education  policy  is  rapid  human  resource \ndevelopment to meet the labor needs of a highly competitive market economy within a socialist \nframework to ensure a high level of equity. One of Viet Nam\u2019s advantages today is its educated, \nskilled, and low-cost workforce, but this amounts to only 27% of the national labor force, compared \nwith 50% in some other developing countries in the region.1 To maintain this advantage in the face \nof regional and global competition, the Government plans to increase the percentage of the skilled \nworkforce to 30% by 2007, 40% by 2010, and 60% by 2020. However, the key factor determining \nwhether Viet Nam will be able to maintain this advantage is whether the education provided will \nmake  the  workforce  competitive  in  terms  of  the  creative  and  analytical  skills  needed  in  a \nknowledge- and technology-based industrial economy. \n \n2.  The  importance  of  education  and  training  is  also  recognized  in  the  achievement  of \nMillennium Development Goal (MDGs) and Viet Nam Development Goal (VDGs). Viet Nam has \nalready achieved poverty targets, halving income poverty and largely eradicating extreme poverty \nand hunger. Good progress has also been made toward achieving other social goals such as \nuniversal primary education, gender equality, child mortality, and maternal health, and improving \naccess to safe drinking water. Progress is being made toward combating HIV/AIDS and other \ncommunicable diseases, and mainstreaming environment sustainability in national policies and \nprograms. \n \n3.  Despite these achievements, increased efforts will be required to ensure that key MDGs \nrelated to child mortality, safe drinking water, the environment, and HIV/AIDS control are met,2 and \nto improve the quality of key services such as education. The MDGs and VDGs established several \ndevelopment targets related to education3 including: (i) universal primary education, as measured \nby  the  net  enrollment  rate  (NER),  by  2015;  (ii)  universal  progression  to  grade  5  by  2015; \n(iii) universal youth (aged 15\u201324) literacy by 2015; (iv) gender parity in primary and secondary \nschool  by  2005;  (v)  gender  parity  in  youth  literacy;  (vi)  reduced  child  mortality  and  child \nmalnutrition; and (vii) reduced inequality among ethnic minorities and preservation of the ability to \nread and write in the ethnic languages. \n \n4.  Education  and  Training  System  and  Structure. The national education and training \nsystem is all-encompassing, ranging from the nursery to doctorate programs, and from formal \nschooling and training to nonformal and continuing education. There are four levels of schooling: \n(i) pre-primary, catering to students aged 3\u20135 years; (ii) 5-year primary education from age 6; \n(iii) 4-year lower secondary education (LSE) schooling; and (iv) a 3- or 4-year upper secondary \neducation (USE) phase, where students are enrolled in either (a) an upper secondary school with a \nfocus on higher education, or (b) a professional secondary school with a focus on vocational \ntraining. To ensure the achievement of an acceptable standard, some students may repeat a year, \nwith a low general repetition rate for lower secondary students of 0.8% but with marked regional \ndifferences. To cater to students who drop out of school but wish either to continue their education \nin a less formal setting or to qualify for re-enrollment in formal education, nonformal education \nprograms have been established and operate nationally in over 4,000 venues using a modified \ncurriculum.  \n                                                 \n1  Address by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung before the National Assembly, 27 November 2006. \n2  An  assessment  of  the  current  status  of  progress  toward  the  MDGs  can  also  be  found  at \nwww.undp.org.vn/mdg/mdgvne.htm.

Policy Planning and Finance. Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has overall \nresponsibility for the education sector and sets broad policy directions for all levels of education. \nHowever, management responsibility for school buildings, staffing, and distribution of financial \nresources has been progressively decentralized. Universities are managed directly by MOET, but \nupper secondary and professional secondary schools are managed at the provincial level by the \ndepartments  of  education  and  training  (DOETs),  while  lower  secondary  schools  and  primary \nschools are managed locally at the district or commune level by bureaus of education and training \n(BOETs). Service provision has become increasingly decentralized and increasing revenue raising \npowers at the local level.   \n \n6.  School funding is a complex process with revenue provided at the state, province, and local \nlevel. Funds provided by the state are distributed in line with a per capita index weighted according \nto degree of economic disadvantage. The funds are supplemented at the local level through the \napplication  of  fees  that  cover  the  necessary  teaching  and  learning  expenses  and  school \n ", "28  Appendix 2   \ndevelopment.  Through  targeted  programs,  the  state  provides  fee  relief  and  scholarships  for \nstudents  who  are  policy  beneficiaries  such  as  ethnic  minorities,  students  who  live  in  difficult \ncircumstances, and excellent learners at all levels of schooling, in public and nonpublic schools.  \n \n7.  Formal education is mostly provided by the Government through state-run schools. But \nnonpublic institutions also operate at all educational levels, from early childhood care to higher \neducation. The Government encourages the development of nonpublic schools as a matter of \npolicy, although the education law states that private, people-funded, and semipublic schools all \nbelong  to  and  contribute  to  the  national  education  system.  As  part  of  the  national  system, \nnonpublic schools benefit from incentive policies for facilities, land, taxes, fees, credit, insurance, \nand  commendation  and  reward  systems  according  to  government  regulations.  The  same \nexpectations and laws apply to both public and nonpublic schools in implementing the objectives, \ncontent, curriculum, textbooks, teaching methods, and regulations relating to enrollment, teaching \nand learning, examinations, completion requirements, diploma certification, and other matters.  \n \n8.  Education  Sector  Policy  Framework  and  Goals.  To  improve  both  the  quality  and \naccessibility of education, the Government passed a new education law on 14 June 2005 outlining \nthe goals and principles of education. A number of supporting policy documents also help guide \neducational decision making. For secondary education, the most relevant are: (i) the MDGs and \nVDGs, (ii) the Education Strategic Development Plan 2001\u20132010, (iii) the National Action Plan for \nEducation for All 2003\u20132015, (iv) the 5-year Strategic Education Development Plan 2006\u20132010, \nand (v) the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010. \n \n9.  Secondary  Education  and  Ethnic  Minorities. The Government has paid attention to \nethnic minority education since its founding. The first constitution of Viet Nam (1946) stated: \u201cThe \nethnic minority nationals have the right to receive compulsory and fee-free primary and lower \nsecondary education in the local schools by means of their languages.\u201d Since then, numerous \ndecrees and decisions have been issued and ratified confirming the importance of education for \nethnic  minorities.  In  spite  of  these  high-level  policies,  the  outcomes  for  ethnic  minorities  in \neducation at all levels remain well below the national average. The accessibility and quality of \neducation are particularly affected by the poverty that often afflicts ethnic minority communities, as \nwell as geographical isolation and other cultural barriers. \n \n10.  Barriers to Education Access and Quality. Household poverty level is an indicator of \neducation outcome, as poor families experience more difficulty in meeting both the direct cost of \neducation and the opportunity cost. Poor areas often coincide with a concentration of ethnic \nminorities. 75% of ethnic minorities live in poverty, and women are particularly disadvantaged. An \nestimate of the poverty rate in Viet Nam by 2010 puts it at 21% of the population, and ethnic \nminorities will account for nearly 40% of the poor, close to three times their share of the population. \nThe Central Highlands and Northern Mountain regions are the poorest regions. Poverty rates vary \nbetween ethnic minority groups. The poorest ethnic minorities are the Ba Na, the Ede, the Gia-rai, \nand the Co Ho in the Central Highlands, and the Hmong and Muong in the Northern Mountain \nregion. Ethnic minority groups in the Mekong River Delta, on the other hand, have experienced a \nsteady decline in poverty and have the lowest rate of poverty among the ethnic minority regions. \nEthnic minorities in the Northern Mountain region have experienced the steadiest improvement in \nliving standards, but poverty among groups in the Central Highlands has increased.4  \n \n11.  Enrollment. In LSE, ethnic minorities now compose 14% of enrollment, equivalent to the \nproportion of ethnic minorities in the population as a whole. Current data on completion rates are not \navailable. Ethnic minorities constitute 13.9% of enrollments at LSE and 12% of enrollment in USE, a \nlittle below their overall share of the population. These enrollment figures are likely to include \n                                                 \n4  A collapse in coffee prices has been a factor in the economic development of the Central Highlands. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nsignificant overage enrollment, as ethnic minorities in remote areas often delay the enrollment of their \nchildren in primary school because of the distances needed to travel to school, and ethnic minorities \nalso experience higher rates of repetition at the primary level, leading to overage entry into LSE. \nThus, correct-age enrollment for ethnic minorities is likely to be lower than these figures, although no \ndata are available to ascertain this. While the data can be treated only as estimates, they show a \nsignificant  gap  between  the  ethnic  minority  school-age  population  and  the  minority  share  of \nenrollment for the provinces of Ha Giang, Gia Lai, Dak Nong, and Binh Phuoc. For these provinces, \nthe share of ethnic minority LSE enrollment is significantly below the estimated ethnic minority share \nof the school-age cohort.  \n \n12.  School enrollment rates vary between groups, but enrollment rates for ethnic minorities \n(non-Kinh  and  Hoa)  are  typically  lower  than  the  national  average  and  often  show  gender \nimbalances.5 For all groups except the Ba Na, the rates for girls are slightly lower than those for \nboys. Girls\u2019 primary NER substantially lag behind those for boys for three ethnic minority groups in \nthe Northern Uplands\u2014the Dao, the Thai, and the Hmong. These rates can be expected to have \nimproved over the last 5 years, reflecting the increasing rates of enrollment. However, the pattern \nis likely to have remained similar, with the Hmong and Dao still showing lower enrollment rates \nthan  other  ethnic  minority  groups.  The  provinces  that  show  lower  rates  of  ethnic  minority \nenrollment  at  USE  level  are  those  with  concentrations  of  Dao,  Hmong,  and  Khmer.  These \nprovinces are Lao Cai and Yen Bai in the Northeast, all of the Northwest provinces (Dien Bien, Lai \nChau, Son La), and Tra Vinh and Soc Trang in the Mekong River Delta. The Central Highlands \nprovinces (Kon Tum and Gia Lai) also show difficulties in the ethnic minority transition to USE. \n \n13.  Issues to Be Addressed. Improving the accessibility and quality of education for ethnic \nminorities will consume more resources as these children face considerable obstacles to the \nsuccessful completion of education of a national level of quality. Higher-than-average education \nexpenditure per capita will be required for ethnic minority children. Provinces with a high proportion \nof  economically  disadvantaged  ethnic  minorities  do  not  have  the  same  capacity  to  pay  for \neducation as those in more economically advantaged areas. Targeted assistance is the only way \nthat these provinces can achieve national education goals. Future expansion of school-level non-\nsalary recurrent expenditure will be through school-raised fees. Government policies such as \nscholarships and fee exemptions may be expanded. Standardizing the funding mechanism may \nadd  clarity  to  education  financing  initiatives  for  ethnic  minorities,  while  allowing  for  provincial \nvariations. This will also ensure that support can be targeted to the ethnic minorities with the lowest \neducational outcomes. \n \n14.  Enough  Funds  to  Provide  Good-Quality  Education.  A  mechanism  for  tracking \nexpenditure on ethnic minority students at the school level would enable the monitoring of the \neffectiveness of educational expenditure. Expansion to full-day schooling needs to be supported by \nthe state budget rather than by community financing if it is be affordable to poor and ethnic minority \nstudents. LSE semi-boarding facilities will be required until the lower secondary school network \nhas  been  sufficiently  expanded  into  remote  communes.  Investment  in  good-quality  support \nfacilities  (e.g.,  library  and  homework  facilities,  satisfactory  sanitation  and  cooking  facilities  in \nteacher  housing)  is  required,  in  addition  to  improving  the  quality  of  the  educational  facilities \n(classrooms, special function rooms, and equipment). More strategic teacher training including \npro-poor material development and school-based in-service training is also considered quite useful \nin most ethnic minority areas in the country, where teachers and education planners have limited \nopportunities to upgrade their skills and capacity to meet ethnic minority needs.  \n                                                 \n5  According to the latest disaggregated data (1999) on net enrollment rates in lower secondary education among ethnic \nminority males and females. \n ", "EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR 3\n0\nPre-Primary Primary Secon(d2a0r0y 1\u2013Present) TTeraaicnhinegr  Higher Nonformal Others           A\n  Multilateral Donors p\np\n2nd Lower Secondary Education Development  Teacher Training  en\nProject, $55 million, Loan, 2004\u20132010: Upper  Project, $25  d\nSmeilclioonn,d Laorya nE,d 2u0c0a2tio\u2013n2 0D0e9v: eTloepchmneicnat lP arnodje ct, $55 m19il9li9o\u2013n2, 0L0o7a:n U, pper  ix 2\nVocational Education Project, $50 million, Loan, Secondary and \n1999\u20132008: Secondary Education Sec Professional \nADB Teacher \nDevelopment \nProject, $33 \nmillion, Loan, \n2006\u20132011             \nEducation for All,  Educational Innovation for Secondary Education Sector Master Plan,  Policy Research  Community  Capacity Building in Provincial \n$96,000, Grant,  Development Program,  Advisory Support, 2006\u20132010 on Teacher  Learning  Educational Planning, $83,000, \n2001\u20132010 n.a., Grant, 2004\u20132008 Management, n.a.,  Centers for  Grant, 2003\u20132004: Various \nGrant, 2005\u20132008 Poverty  Initiatives Supporting Cultural \nUNESCO Reduction,  Activities, $179,000, Grant, \n$220,000,  2002\u20132003\nGrant, \n2003\u20132004\nPrimary Education for  Primary Teacher  2nd Higher Education  Capacity Building in Provincial \nDisadvantaged Children  Development, $35 Project, $70 million,  Educational Planning, \nProject, n.a., Loan,  million, Loan,  Loan, 2007\u20132012 $200,000, Grant, 2003\u20132009: \n2003\u20132009: Education for  2001\u20132005 Targeted Budget Support, $50 \nAll Plan Information  million, Loan, 2006\u20132010\nWB\nWorkshop, $49,000, \nGrant, 2002\u20132003\nEarly Childhood  Child Friendly Primary  Secondary Education Sector Master Plan,  Adolescent \nDevelopment, n.a.,  Education, $3.9 million,  Advisory Support, 2006\u20132010 Development & \nGrant, 2006\u20132010 Grant, 2006\u20132010 Participation, \nUNICEF\n$3.2 million, \nGrant, \n2006\u20132010\nSupport to the Renovation  European Studies Programme \nof Education  in Viet Nam, $1.4 million, \nManagement, 2006\u20132009,  Grant, 2001\u20132004 \nEU \u20ac10 million", "Teacher \nPre-Primary Primary Secondary  Higher Nonformal Others\nTraining\n  Bilateral Donors\nPrimary Education In  Secondary Education Sector Master Plan,  Support to Ha Noi  Adult Literacy  Human Resource Development\nNorthern Areas, $4.4  Advisory Support, 2006\u20132010 Industrial College, $9.2  Programs in  Scholarship, $7.4 million, \nmillion, Grant, 2007:  million, Grant,  Northern  Grant, 2000\u20132003: Training \nStrengthening Cluster- 1999\u20132005:  Areas, $2.1  Programs in Japan, $13.2 \nbased  School  Strengthening the  million, Grant,  million, Grant, 2002\u20132003: \nJICA Management, n.a., Grant,  Capacity of Hanoi  1997\u20132003 Japan Centers, $9 million, \n2004\u20132007: Dispatch of  University of Technology, Grant, 2000\u20132005\nExpert, $15 million, Grant,  n.a.

The Lower Secondary Education for the Most Disadvantaged Regions Project will provide \ntwo different scholarship schemes: (i) a scholarship program for teacher training for ethnic minority \nstudents, and (ii) a pilot scholarship program for the smallest ethnic minority groups.  \n   \nA.  Scholarship Program for Teacher Training for Ethnic Minority Students  \n \n2.  Background. The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) 9099-VIE: Expansion of the \nLearning  Opportunities  for  Ethnic  Minority  Youth  Program  has  pilot-tested  a  new  transitional \nprogram. The program builds on the successes of the transitional program, \u2014a scholarship program \nfor upper secondary school (USS) ethnic minority students who hope to go to teacher training \ncolleges (TTCs) to become lower secondary school (LSS) teachers in their communes\u2014 which was \nimplemented under Loan 1718-VIE: Teacher Training Project. The objectives of the program are to \n(i) reduce socioeconomic barriers for minority youth in gaining access to and completing teacher \ntraining, (ii) enhance their readiness for TTCs, (iii) supply qualified minority teachers to meet local \nneeds, and (iv) raise awareness among minority youth and encourage them to take an active role in \ncommunity development initiatives. \n \n3.  Program Description. Under the new transitional program, minority USS students (50% \nfemale) in grade 12 will be selected as candidate scholarship recipients. The students will undergo \nTTC preparatory courses. Those students who successfully enter TTC will receive the scholarship. \nA scholarship amount of $455 will be allocated per student per year, with $300 going directly to the \nstudent  and  $155  to  the  TTC.  The  program  will  continue  the  work  of  the  pilot,  including:  (i) \nidentifying beneficiaries who meet the agreed selection criteria; (ii) conducting a tracer study for the \nbeneficiary students, assessing its impact, and making recommendations for future scholarship \npolicies; and (iii) mitigating the shortage of qualified minority teachers in their communities.  \n \n4.  Selection Criteria. Selection procedures and committee memberships will be the same as \nthose  under  the  new  transitional  program.  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  has \ndeveloped selection criteria authorized by interministerial circular No. 04/2001/TTLT-BGD&DT from \nthe Department of Human Resources, Office of the Government and Ethnic Minority Committee, \nand  MOET,  on  the  enrollment  of  ethnic  minority  students  in  the  transitional  program  to \npostsecondary  institutions.  The  selection  is  based  on  household  income,  gender,  commuting \ndistance, age limitation, and other poverty indicators of ethnic minority families. The selection \ncommittees  are  composed  of  people\u2019s  committee  members,  the  provincial  departments  of \neducation, and other provincial offices of the steering committee ministries. The committees are \nresponsible for transparent and appropriate beneficiary identification. \n \n5.  Cost and Time Frame. The overall cost of the program will be $0.46 million. Details of the \ncost of the output are provided in the cost estimates for the Project. No civil works are planned and \nno equipment or furniture is expected to be purchased. The program, to be financed by the Project, \nwill cover 48 months, or 4 academic years, beginning in the third year of LSEMDR. \n \n6.  Expected Outputs. The program will have the following outputs: (i) 250 ethnic minority \nstudents  will  benefit  from  the  new  transitional  program  and  enter  TTCs,  and  (ii)  90%  of  the \nbeneficiary students will complete the pre-service program and become schoolteachers. \n \n7.  Sustainability. MOET will undertake a tracer study to evaluate the impact and effectiveness \nof the pilot new transitional program after the graduation of scholarship students from the TTCs. In \nthe long term, the Government will have to develop a sustainable cost-recovery scholarship scheme \nin which the beneficiaries will be expected to return the scholarship expenses to the Government \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \nonce they become teachers. This will allow the program to benefit a larger number of students and \ndiscussion on a long-term policy on scholarship and incentives programs will be facilitated. \n \nB.  Pilot Scholarship Program for the Smallest Ethnic Minority Groups \n \n8.  Background. The proposed program is aimed at addressing the particular problems faced \nby  the  smallest  ethnic  minority  groups  by  developing  a  new  scholarship  scheme  for  minority \nstudents  to  attend  secondary  school.  The  Government  has  identified  the  21  smallest  minority \ngroups (those whose total population is less than 15,000) as those most in need of assistance. The \nmost recent statistics back this up, clearly showing that the smallest population groups have the \nhighest poverty head count and the widest poverty gap. The pilot scholarship program will examine \nthe impact of funding on enrollment and the progression of the selected minority students. \n \n9.  Program  Description.  The  program  will  provide  scholarships  to  800  lower  secondary \nstudents, at least 50% of whom are girls, from the most disadvantaged (i.e., the smallest) minority \ngroups. The unit cost of assistance for the program will be $200 per year. Individual student \nallowances will consist of a daily living allowance and a small amount for clothing and bedding. The \nProject will identify beneficiaries among the eligible minority group students in grade 5 who want to \ncontinue their studies and who meet the agreed selection criteria. The beneficiaries will receive \nscholarships beginning in grade 6 for the duration of their LSS.  \n \n10.  Selection Criteria. All grade 5 students belonging to the smallest minority groups will be \neligible, provided they do not fall under other government scholarship initiatives.1 The pilot program \nwill include the following selection guidelines: (i) at least 50% of beneficiaries will be girls; (ii) as far \nas possible, at least 50% of beneficiaries will be semi-boarding or homestay students living away \nfrom  home  during  the  school  week;  and  (iii)  the  proportions  of  beneficiaries  will  reflect  the \nproportions of ethnic minority groups in the district to the extent possible.  \n \n11.  Cost and Time Frame. The overall cost of the program will be $0.64 million. No civil works \nare planned and no purchases of equipment or furniture are expected. Cost details are provided in \nthe cost estimates for the Project. The program, to be financed by the Project, will cover 48 months.  \n \n12.  Expected  Outputs. The output of the pilot program will be data showing the effect of \nfunding on student retention and achievement in the smallest minority groups. The data will feed \ninto discussions on long-term scholarship policy. Assessment indicators will pertain to the number of \nminority students supported by the new program, and percentages of the beneficiary students who \ncomplete LSS. Data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnic minority. The pilot program is \nexpected to have the following specific outputs: (i) 800 minority students will receive the pilot \nscholarship, and (ii) 90% will complete LSS. \n \n13.  Sustainability. The anticipated development impact of the program will be measured in \nterms of whether students continue their studies beyond LSS. MOET will undertake a tracer study to \nevaluate the impact and effectiveness of the pilot scholarship program on each student within 2 \nyears  of  the  last  payment  of  the  scholarship.  The  program  will  complement  ongoing  project \ncomponents including the construction of secondary school facilities, support for pre- and in-service \ntraining, and capacity building for targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups.  \n                                                 \n1  In 2005, the minister of the Committee of Ethnic Minorities issued Decisions 291\u2013296 approving the provision of \nscholarships to support the smallest minorities. Government scholarships will go to students from the five smallest \nminorities\u2014Brau and Ro Mang in Kon Tum province; Odu in Nghe An province; Pu Beo in Ha Giang province; and Si La \nin the provinces of Dien Bien and Lai Chau. The scholarship amounts are D30,000 for kindergarten; D45,000 for primary \nschool; and D160,000 for both LSS and USS. The funds flow arrangements involve transfers from the Ministry of \nFinance to the provincial budget. Minority parents can collect the money directly from the commune poverty reduction \nteam, with prior approval from the commune people\u2019s committee. \n ", "PROJECT RESULTS-BASED MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nA.

A special feature of the Project is the selection of the project beneficiary areas. In the \npast,  official  development  assistance  project  areas  were  often  selected  as  \u201cdisadvantaged \nprovinces\u201d by the Government. However, the project survey shows significant intra-provincial \ndisparities: the social and education conditions are often far more severe in some districts \nbelonging to relatively wealthy provinces than in better-off districts in poorer provinces. With the \nconventional target selection, the poor districts from the \u201cnon-disadvantaged provinces\u201d would \nnot  be  core  targets.  The  Project  identifies  \u201cthe  most  disadvantaged  districts\u201d  rather  than \nprovinces,  using  comprehensive  pro-poor  indicators.  As  agreed  with  the  Government,  the \nselection criteria are (i) socioeconomic indicators; (ii) education indicators; and (iii) other factors, \nsuch as availability of support from the Government or donor partners, geographic balance, \npriority in government policies, and priority among natural disaster-prone regions. \n \n2.  Initial Selection. Two processes were followed in selecting the initial set of candidate \nprovinces:  (i)  scoring  according  to  ranking  of  provinces  by  each  criterion;  and  (ii)  scoring \naccording to absolute data for each criterion, with no ranking. A comparison of the results of the \ntwo  processes  gave  a  total  of  16  candidate  provinces  that  met  the  criteria  of  being \nsocioeconomically  disadvantaged  and  in  need  of  assistance  in  reaching  universal  lower \nsecondary education (LSE). In addition to the 16 \u201cpriority provinces,\u201d four other provinces were \nproposed for inclusion in the list. Finally, geographic criteria were applied to ensure that there \nwas  a  reasonable  distribution  of  candidate  provinces  among  the  regions:  northern  (eight \ncandidates), central (seven), and southern (seven). \n \n3.  Initial Survey Data. Information was collected from candidate districts in two parts: \n(i) standard district data on population, physical characteristics, and socioeconomic indicators \ndisaggregated  by  gender  and  population  group;  and  (ii)  specific  information  on  students, \nteachers, physical facilities and equipment, etc., through a specifically designed questionnaire. \nThe  data  sets  are  available  in  the  midterm  report\u2014though  some  of  the  data  are  clearly \ninaccurate.  \n \n4.  Scoring. The criteria used to identify target districts were basically the same as those \nused in the initial selection of provinces, with a focus on a high ratio of poor households, high \nratio of communes with no lower secondary school (LSS), low coverage of LSE, and low \nenrollment figures, especially for girls, as well as gross enrollment ratio. Cleaned data from the \nsurvey were used in assigning scores against percentage values calculated from the data \nreceived from the districts. Where data for a district were missing or clearly wrong, an average \nfor the other districts in the province was calculated and applied. \n \n5.  The percentage of poor households was deemed to be a better district socioeconomic \nindicator than per capita income. In response to comments obtained during the midterm report \nworkshop, \u201caverage distance to school\u201d was used, to give greater weight to access. In the \nsouthern regions, limitations to access are a function of terrain (e.g., river crossings) rather than \ndistance from the school, so scoring was designed to eliminate this variation. An additional two \ncriteria  were  added  (class-classroom  ratio  and  number  of  new  classrooms  needed)  after \ndiscussions with Ministry of Education and Training (MOET).  \n \n6.  Final Selection of Proposed Districts. For each district, the total score obtained from \nall  criteria  was  calculated,  and  the  districts  were  ranked  in  order  of  vulnerability  (most \ndisadvantaged = ranking 1; least disadvantaged = ranking 197). The final selection approved by \nMOET comprises 103 of the neediest districts in Viet Nam from 17 provinces. \n ", "   \nFigure A6: Selection Criteria and Procedure to Identify Target Provinces and

The 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan \n2006\u20132010 targets universal secondary education (lower secondary by 2010 and upper and professional secondary \neducation by 2015) as a key priority. Special emphasis is placed on reaching ethnic minorities in remote areas for \nequitable and inclusive development. Access to secondary schooling has expanded significantly in recent years, but \nnational averages mask significant disparities in enrollment, which is unevenly distributed by ethnic group, gender, \nsocioeconomic status, and location. Poverty analysis conducted for the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan \n(SESMP) 2006\u20132010 shows that household income is strongly correlated with educational attainment. Ethnic minority \nyouth, and particularly girls, remain the most disadvantaged in secondary education. They have for the most part not \nbenefited from economic growth and poverty reduction, and risk falling further behind if secondary education remains \nout of reach. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Targeting Classification \n              Targeted Intervention (Geographic) \n \nWith the goal of targeting disadvantaged districts in Viet Nam, extensive poverty analysis and consultation was \nundertaken, including (i) a survey of socioeconomic and education data from all districts in 20 provinces in the \nregions  that  were  identified  as  disadvantaged\u2014the  Northern  Mountain  region  (comprising  the  Northwest  and \nNortheast regions), the Central Highlands, the Mekong River Delta, and one province in the Southeast Region; (ii) an \nanalysis of statistical data from the Government Statistics Office (GSO) and the Ministry of Education and Training \n(MOET); (iii) a review of surveys, studies, and reports from other projects; (iv) background work done for SESMP \n2006\u20132010; and (v) field visits to selected districts and communes. The Project\u2019s rigorous district-level selection \nmethodology (see Appendix 5) is unique among education projects in Viet Nam and lends the design a strong poverty \nfocus. \n \nEthnic and Geographic Aspects of Poverty. Viet Nam had a population of more than 83 million in 2005, with an \nannual growth rate of 1.4%. An ethno-linguistically diverse range of 53 ethnic minorities compose 14% of the \npopulation. For the most part, minorities reside in remote, mountainous regions, along the northern and western \nborders with northeast Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. The \nKhmer, who live in the lowlands of the Mekong River Delta, and the Cham, who mostly reside along the Central \nCoast and Delta region, are exceptions. With Viet Nam\u2019s impressive growth and poverty reduction there has been a \nshift in the locus of poverty from being widespread throughout the population to being localized in specific groups that \nare harder to reach. Minorities are particularly vulnerable. In 2004 the national poverty incidence was 26% in rural \nareas and 14% in urban areas (Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey 2004, based on the government poverty \nstandard of D200,000 per capita per month in rural areas and D260,000 per capita per month in urban areas). There \nare dramatic regional disparities in poverty incidence, e.g., 52% in the Northwest vs. 6% in the Southeast. Poverty \nincidence in the Northeast and Central Highlands stood at 29% and 33%, respectively. Minorities compose one third \nof all poor people\u2014the poverty gap for minorities is 19%, compared with 3% for poor Kinh. If current trends persist, \nby 2010 poverty will predominantly be related to ethnicity. The VHLSS 2004 data confirm that the smallest ethnic \nminority groups (e.g., those with a population of less than 15,000) are also the poorest. \n \nPoverty and Education. Poverty among minority groups is closely associated with low or limited access to education \nand training opportunities. The VLHSS 2004 found that only 29% of ethnic minority adults aged 18 and over had \ncompleted lower secondary education. The main barriers to access are lack of infrastructure, physical inaccessibility, \nlanguage and cultural barriers, a lack of good-quality teachers, a curriculum that is not suited to local needs or \nlanguages, and high costs (direct, indirect, and opportunity costs), coupled with the perception that returns from \neducation are low. Education indicators for minorities are well below average, and lower still for minority girls. Where \nKinh boys have 8.5 mean years of schooling, minority girls have only 4.5. Dropout rates are higher for minorities, and \nhighest for minority girls. For those who can afford secondary schooling, physical distance means having to board at \nschool or in private homes, at least during the week. Semi-boarding at school is particularly difficult for girls because \nof security and privacy concerns. Sociocultural factors also play a role in keeping girls out of school: minority girls \ntend to marry early, especially in the Hmong culture. Many children drop out of school in the absence of parental \nencouragement and discipline, and when parents do not see the relevance of education they do not object. \nOpportunity costs become higher as children enter their teens and are needed for agricultural work, or child care in  \n \n ", "60  Appendix 15 \n \nthe case of girls. Increasingly, opportunities for nonagricultural work may also be having an effect, especially in areas \nlike the Southeast and the Mekong River Delta, where economic growth is fastest. \n \nC.

The Lower Secondary Education for the Most Disadvantaged Regions Project will improve \naccess  to  good-quality  secondary  education  through  targeted  interventions  in  the  most \ndisadvantaged districts in Viet Nam. The Project is specifically aimed at benefiting girls and ethnic \nminorities. This gender and ethnic minority action plan (GEMAP) is based on social analysis and \nstakeholder consultations and highlights specific actions that will be implemented and monitored \nduring implementation. The elements have been integrated into the project design, and indicators \nare included in the design and monitoring framework. The GEMAP follows Viet Nam\u2019s regulations \nand education guidelines, and was prepared in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \n2.  Overview of Gender and Minority Issues in Education. The gap in socioeconomic status \nbetween  Viet  Nam\u2019s  minority  groups  and  the  majority  Kinh  is  getting  wider.  Major  factors \ncontributing to this disparity include: (i) geographic remoteness and challenging climatic conditions \nin  minority  areas;  (ii)  a  limited  supply  of  schools;  (iii)  a  lack  of  adequate  boarding  facilities; \n(iv) direct, indirect, and opportunity costs of secondary education; and (v) cultural factors including \nthe low value placed on education because of a perceived lack of relevance, especially for girls, \nwho in many minorities are expected to marry at a young age. The regions of Viet Nam with large \nminority populations are also the country\u2019s poorest. While access, equity, and participation in \nsecondary education have generally improved over the past decade, gender disparities are still \nconsiderable, especially among poor and ethnic minority households living in remote rural areas. \nThis inequality is best illustrated by mean years of schooling, with girls and boys achieving, on \naverage, 5.6 and 6.8 years, respectively. This gap widens dramatically when ethnicity is factored \nin: ethnic minority girls achieve only 4.5 mean years of schooling, compared with 8.5 years for \nethnic Kinh and Chinese boys.  \n \n3.  Table A16.1 shows the relationship between geography, minority population, poverty, and \ngender gaps in lower secondary education. The Northern Mountain region has the largest gender \ngaps: in Lai Chao province only 37% of lower secondary students are girls. The 2004 Viet Nam \nHousehold Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) revealed that less than one third (only 29%) of all \nethnic  minority  adults  aged  18  and  older  had  completed  lower  secondary  education.  Ethnic \nminority children who are able to attend secondary school face a major barrier to academic \nachievement in their limited proficiency in the Vietnamese language. Poorly equipped schools, \nlimited teacher supply, and teaching methods that fail to respond to the needs of nonnative \nspeakers perpetuate social exclusion and isolation. \n \n4.  The opportunity costs of education are considerably higher for minorities and girls than for \nboys, as shown by the participation of children aged 11\u201314 in income-generating activities. While \nthe  percentage  of  school-aged  children  engaged  in  income-generating  activities  fell  overall \nbetween 1997 and 2004 as more children stayed in school longer, ethnic minority girls in rural \nareas were more likely to have worked than other girls or their male counterparts. Ethnic minority \nchildren are twice as likely to work as Kinh or Chinese children, and ethnic minority girls are more \nlikely to work than minority boys. Among the 11\u201314 age group, 42% of minority girls work vs. 19% \nof Kinh or Chinese boys.1 Among children aged 15\u201317, only 61% of minority girls are enrolled in \nschool compared to 71% of ethnic Kinh/Hoa, indicating that ethnic minority girls are more likely to \nleave school early for marriage or income generation. In 2002 the literacy rate for Kinh/Chinese \nwomen was 92%, while for Thai and Hmong women it was 70% and 22%, respectively. \n \n5.  Of the three project regions, the Northern Mountain region is the most culturally diverse. \nSome groups (e.g., Tay, Thai, Muong, and Nung) tend to live in the more accessible and fertile \n                                                 \n1 Lee, Sunhwa, 2006.

Others, such as the Hmong and Dao, rank among the \npoorest,  living  at  higher  elevations  with  difficult  access  and  low  land  productivity.  This  low \nproductivity requires more children to assist in agricultural activities and is reflected in larger \nhouseholds, particularly among the Hmong, who also have the lowest education participation rates \n(particularly among girls). In 2002 the gross enrollment rate for the Hmong was only 9.8%.2 Net \nenrollment rates were 7.5% for boys versus 1.6% for girls. Enrollment rates for the Dao were also \nlow  at  20.3%,  but  with  little  difference  between  boys  and  girls.  This  contrasted  sharply  with \nenrollment rates for more assimilated groups, e.g., the Thai and Muong, for whom gross enrollment \nrates were more than 75%. \n \nTable A16.1: Ethnicity, Poverty, and Gender Gaps in Enrollment in the 17 Project Provinces \nEthnic  Food  Per Capita \nMinority  Poverty  Income Rank  Lower Secondary School \nRegion  Province  Population  Incidence  (out of 64)  Enrollments \n          Girls   Minorities \nNational    16%  7%  \u2014  48%  14% \nLai Chau  88%  36%  64  37%  83% \nDien Bien  84%  26%  63  39%  80% \nNorth West  Son La  86%  17%  60  44%  82% \nLao Cai  69%  24%  58  45%  70% \nYen Bai  59%  8%  51  46%  55% \nHa Giang  88%  16%  62  46%  82% \nNorth East  Cao Bang  97%  22%  59  49%  97% \nBac Kan  90%  24%  61  47%  89% \nDac Lac  34%  13%  37  50%  29% \nCentral  Kon Tum  58%  13%  48  48%  51% \nHighlands  Gia Lai  42%  14%  43  48%  31% \nDac Nong  34%  20%  45  54%  22% \nTra Vinh  32%  9%  33  48%  30% \nMekong  Soc Trang  32%  9%  34  47%  27% \nRiver Delta  Kien Giang  13%  5%  12  47%  12% \nCa Mau  2%  6%  10  45%  2% \nSouth East  Ninh Thuan  24%  12%  36  48%  18% \nNote: Based on population aged 11\u201314. \nSources: DFA Survey 2006, VHLSS 2004, MOET Statistical Yearbook 2006. \n \n6.  The large forests and fertile soil of the Central Highlands have brought about substantial \ngrowth through agricultural production. Cash crops such as coffee are a major source of revenue \nand a major attraction for ethnic Kinh and minorities who migrated in from the north. This influx of \nmigrants has resulted in an indigenous minority population of only 26%. Major minorities here \ninclude the Gia-rai, Ba-na, E-de, Mnong, and Xo-dang. Enrollment rates for both lower and upper \nsecondary are well below the national average, at 87% and 50%, respectively. Wide disparities in \naccess to education exist between the indigenous minorities and the new migrants, especially the \nKinh. Enrollment rates among minorities are half those of the Kinh (see footnote 2).32 Differences \n                                                 \n2   Baulch,  Bob,  Dominique  Haughton,  Jonathan  Haughton,  and  Truong  Thi  Kim  Chuyen.  2002.

The Central Highlands is the only region \nwhere there is a projected increase in the number of teachers needed over the next 5 years. At the \nsame time, the proportion of ethnic minority teachers has decreased from an already low base, 9% \nin 2001, to only 3% in 2005. This has implications for minority students\u2019 learning environment if \nthey experience difficulties learning in Vietnamese and have limited opportunities to learn in their \nown languages at school. \n \n7.  The Mekong Delta is culturally less diverse than other regions, with two main minority \ngroups (Khmer and Cham). Much of the region is remote and experiences annual flooding. The \nKhmer have benefited from the economic growth in the region but still have higher poverty rates \nthan the Kinh. In fact, within any province, poverty among the Khmer is always substantially higher \nthan among the other ethnic groups.4 Lower secondary enrollment rates are substantially lower \nthan the national average, at 80% gross and 68% net, as compared with the national averages of \n92% and 83%, respectively. \n \n8.  One of the main strategies for improving minorities\u2019 access to education has been the \nestablishment of boarding schools at regional, provincial, and district levels, in which all education \nexpenses are covered by the Government. However, their coverage is low, with less than 5% of \nminorities  benefiting.  In  recognition  of  this,  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  has \nemphasized  improving  the  semi-boarding  facilities  to  accommodate  minority  children  living  in \nremote villages. In addition, many children stay in private housing in return for rent or, more often, \nwork. Substantial resources for the construction of secondary schools, classrooms, and dormitories \nare needed to achieve universal secondary education for ethnic minorities. Other programs include \nwaiving  of  school  fees,  textbook  lending  schemes,  partial  scholarships,  and  exemption  from \nentrance exams at the tertiary level. The Government specifically recognizes the need to target the \nmost disadvantaged ethnic minority groups, defined as those 21 minorities with a total population \nof less than 15,000. The 2004 VHLSS confirms these groups to have the highest poverty head \ncount, and the most severe poverty gaps.53 \n \n9.  Legal and Policy Context. Viet Nam has a comprehensive legal framework for social and \ngender equality. The Gender Equality Law passed in November 2006 stipulates equal access to \neducation and training. Responsibility for implementing the law falls to the National Committee for \nthe Advancement of Women (NCFAW) and the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU). There are also \nlong-established  policies  and  programs  to  support  minority  groups,  especially  those  living  in \nremote mountainous areas. Multisectoral poverty reduction programs such as Program 135 and \nthe  Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction  Program  (HEPR)  specifically  target  minority \npopulations. \n \n10.  Gender and Ethnic Minorities Action Plan. Specific actions as outlined in the GEMAP \n(Table A16.2) will be implemented, monitored, and refined as required. New actions will also be \nconsidered for inclusion, as deemed appropriate. \n \n11.  Implementation Arrangements. Implementation arrangements and estimated costs of the \nGEMAP have been integrated into the overall arrangements and budget of the Project. A national \nproject  implementation  unit  (NPIU)  will  be  established  within  the  executing  agency  (MOET). \nProvincial  and  district  project  implementation  units  (PPIUs  and  DPIUs)  in  each  of  the  target \n \n           \n3  Though the study is somewhat dated, it is one of the few analyses at this level of disaggregation. \n4  UNDP and AusAid. 2003.

Progress reports will provide updates on the activities, outputs, and outcomes of the \nGEMAP. The midterm review mission will make any necessary adjustments, as required. \n \n12.  Institutional Capacity and Support. Viet Nam has substantial capacity in the area of girls\u2019 \nand ethnic minority education. The National Committee for the Advancement of Women conducts \nresearch into gender issues and works with partners to develop priorities for gender action. The \nVWU provides a national network down to the village level to represent the needs of women and \nparticipate  in  community  mobilization  and  information  dissemination.  The  National  Institute  of \nLinguistics conducts research on minority languages. The National Institute for Education Strategy \nand  Curriculum  conducts  gender  and  educational  research  and  coordinates  curriculum \ndevelopment within MOET. The Department for Ethnic Minority Education61plays a key role in the \ndevelopment of curricula and materials for ethnic minority education. The Project will involve both \nagencies, specifically in conducting operational studies and developing appropriate curricula and \nteaching methods.  \n \nTable A16.2: Gender and Ethnic Minorities Action Plan \n \nLSEMDR Outputs  Actions Proposed \nOutput 1: Improved access to lower  \u25a1  Construct separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys \nsecondary education.   \u25a1  Construct semi-boarding dormitories with security and \na.

The  resettlement  framework  (RF)  contains  guidelines  and  procedures  for  preparing  and \nimplementing any required resettlement plans (RPs) for the Project. It defines the legal basis that \nensures  that  any  affected  persons  (APs)  will  be  provided  with:  (i)  replacement  lands  for  lands \nacquired from them because of the Project, (ii) compensation for their lost productive assets, and \n(iii) assistance in restoring their incomes. The RF has been prepared in lieu of RPs for the Project\u2019s \nsmall-scale  civil  works  (construction  or  upgrading  of  classrooms,  teacher  housing,  student \ndormitories, etc.) for which specific sites have yet to be confirmed.1 \n \n2.  Scope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  In the selection of sites, the executing \nagency (EA) will ensure that civil works are constructed on vacant public lands or on the commune\u2019s \nreserved lands. This principle is contained in the loan covenants and specific assurances. However, \nthe impact of land acquisition will be known only when the sites have been confirmed by the district \nand commune people\u2019s committees, and the property boundaries have been established. All sites will \nbe screened for involuntary resettlement impact. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, a list of civil \nwork sites that details land ownership and confirms the avoidance of land acquisition and involuntary \nresettlement  impact  will  be  prepared.  For  those  sites  where  involuntary  resettlement  cannot  be \navoided, provincial project implementation unit (PPIUs) will prepare and submit RPs for review and \napproval by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) before the award of civil works contract in each site. \nThe  RP  process  includes  screening  all  land  acquisition  for  impact,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncategorization  of  involuntary  resettlement  (Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  [1995]).2 Civil  works \ncontractors will not be issued a notice of possession for a site until (i) compensation payment and \nrelocation to new sites have been satisfactorily completed for the site, (ii) the agreed rehabilitation \nassistance is in place, and (iii) the site is free of all encumbrances. \n \n3.  Project  Principles.  The  following  principles  were  formulated  to  bridge  the  differences \nbetween  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  resettlement  policies,  and  will  apply  to  all  civil  works \nundertaken. \n \n(i)  Acquisition of assets and resettlement of people will be minimized as much as possible \nthrough the identification of possible alternative project designs and appropriate social, \neconomic, operation, and engineering solutions with the least impact on populations, \nparticularly on ethnic minorities, in the subproject area. \n \n(ii)  Lack of formal legal rights to the assets lost should not be used as grounds for \nexcluding APs from compensation, entitlement, and rehabilitation measures. No APs \nwill be displaced from affected land until the village or commune allocates suitable \nalternative land or compensation sufficient to purchase suitable land within the same or \nneighboring village is paid. \n \n(iii)  Affected persons will be systematically informed and consulted about the Project, the \nrights and options available to them, and the proposed mitigating measures, and they \nwill be involved in decision making concerning their resettlement. \n \n(iv)  The consultative process will include not only those affected but also representatives of \nthe districts and communes in which the Project is located, community leaders of host \ncommunities, civil society organizations such as nongovernment organizations, and \nmembers of local people\u2019s organizations. \n \n(v)  The last day of the census and inventory of losses that has been carried out in the \ncommunes as part of the resettlement planning process will represent the cutoff date \nfor  eligibility.  Eligible  persons  are  entitled  to  be  provided  with  compensation  and \n                                                 \n1   This statement is consistent with the provision in para. 40 of OM Section F2/OP issued on 25 September 2006. \n2   Category A: Significant, if 200 or more people experience major impact from a project by being physically displaced from \nhousing or losing 10% or more of their productive (income-generating) assets; a full resettlement plan is required. \nCategory B: Not Significant, if the impact of the project is not deemed significant; a short resettlement plan is required. \nCategory C: no resettlement effects are foreseen; no resettlement plan is required.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 17  67 \nrehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them in improving or at least maintaining \ntheir pre-project living standards, income-earning capacity, and production levels. \n \n(vi)  The compensation and rehabilitation measures to be provided to APs are: \n(a)  replacement of agricultural, residential, or commercial land with land of equal \nsize acceptable to APs;  \n(b)  cash  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  houses  and  other  structures, \nwithout  deduction  for  depreciation  or  the  remaining  values  of  salvageable \nmaterials; and \n(c)  transfer and subsistence allowances. \n \n(vii)  APs will be systematically informed and closely consulted about the Project, the rights \nand options available to them, and proposed mitigation measures. The comments and \nsuggestions of APs and communities will be taken into account. \n \n(viii)  Compensation rates for physical assets, i.e., house, building, and other structures, and \nnonphysical assets like lost income from productive assets or jobs, will be calculated at \nreplacement  cost  or  at  current  market  rates  in  the  project  area  at  the  time  of \ncompensation. \n \n(ix)  Existing cultural and religious practices and observances will be respected, and to the \nmaximum extent practical, preserved. \n \n(x)  The EA will see to it that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure the effective \nimplementation of the RPs, through consultation and the implementation of the land \nacquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n \n(xi)  There  will  be  an  effective  mechanism  for  hearing  and  resolving  grievances  and \ncomplaints during the implementation of the RPs. Grievance committees will include \nrepresentatives from APs, especially women and ethnic minorities. \n \n(xii)  Particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  needs  of  the  poorest  affected  people,  and \nvulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. These will include those \nwithout legal title to land or other assets, households headed by women, the elderly or \ndisabled,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  particularly  ethnic  minority  populations. \nAppropriate assistance will be provided to them to improve their socioeconomic status.  \n \n(xiii)  Resettlement  identification,  planning,  and  management  will  ensure  that  gender \nconcerns  are  incorporated,  including  gender-specific  consultation  and  information \ndisclosure. This includes special attention to guarantee women\u2019s assets, property, and \nland-use rights, and to ensure the restoration of their income and living standards. \n \n(xiv)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover the \ncosts  of  compensation,  entitlements,  and  resettlement  within  the  agreed \nimplementation period. Clear budget commitments are required for critical activities \nsuch as formal detailed physical surveys and administrative functions associated with \ncompensation and resettlement. \n \n(xv)  The key information in the RPs, including measurement-of-losses data, detailed asset \nvaluation, compensation and resettlement options, detailed entitlements and special \nprovisions, grievance procedures, timing of payments, and displacement schedule will \nbe  disclosed  to  APs  in  an  understandable  format  such  as  the  full  RP  or  public \ninformation booklets in the local language, and in commune offices. \n \n(xvi)  Appropriate  reporting  (including  auditing  and  redress  functions),  monitoring,  and \nevaluation mechanisms will be identified and set in place as part of the resettlement \nmanagement system. If the impact of resettlement is significant, the Project will hire an \nexternal  monitoring  agency  to  evaluate  the  resettlement process and  results, with \nreports to be submitted directly to the ADB.  \n \n ", "68  Appendix 17 \n(xvii)  Finally, land acquisition, compensation and resettlement activities must be satisfactorily \ncompleted, rehabilitation measures in place but not necessarily completed as this may \ntake  a  longer  time,  and  the  land  cleared  of  all  obstructions  and  free  from \nencumbrances before a notice of possession of the site is issued to contractors.  \n \n4.  Entitlement Matrix. The RF contains a detailed entitlement matrix summarizing the types of \nimpact, eligibility, and compensation. However, it may not cover all types of impact but can be \nenhanced in the RPs depending on the findings of the social assessment and subproject impact. \nStandards described may not be lowered but might be enhanced in the ensuing RPs as required, and \non the basis of detailed social impact analysis. The entitlement matrix is found in Table A16 at the end \nof this appendix, and the full resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n5.  Socioeconomic  Information.  The  RF  prescribes  the  presentation  of  the  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics of the APs as a major section in all RPs. The data on APs will be recorded in a \nstructured questionnaire during the joint detailed measurement survey and inventory of losses in host \ncommunes where land acquisition will take place. The survey instrument will aim to capture the \nessential data on affected properties like land and other assets, ethnicity, education, income and its \nsources,  vulnerability,  gender,  and  household  population  of  APs,  among  others.  Every  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  questionnaire  will  be  assigned  an  alphanumeric  code  for  tracking  and \nsafekeeping.  The  national  project implementation  unit  (NPIU)  will  coordinate  with  the  respective \nPPIUs for the supervision of the joint detailed measurement survey and inventory of losses. \n \n6.  Grievance and Redress Mechanisms. The NPIU will ensure that the APs are aware of the \nprocedures for filing complaints and the mechanism for redress. Compensation, assistance, and \nresettlement  boards  will  help  resolve  confusion,  misunderstandings,  or  problems  about  land \nacquisition, compensation rates, rehabilitation, and relocation. The RF sets out a four-stage procedure \nfor the redress of grievances that is consistent with the legal process for the resolution of disputes in \nViet Nam. \n \n7.  Financing Plan. All RPs will present a budget for compensation for lands, affected structures, \nother assets, business incomes, relocation and transfer assistance, crops and trees, and special \nassistance, as well as for gender development. Included in the budget presentations are the amounts \nallocated for administration cost, equivalent to 2% of the total cost of compensation and entitlements. \nAll cost items in RPs will be provided with 20% contingency and will be part of Ministry of Education \nand Training\u2019s (MOET) equity in the total cost of the Project. The financial plan for implementing the \nRPs will also be presented. \n \n8.  Implementation Schedule and Monitoring. The Project will be implemented over a period of \n6 years. Before the construction of civil works begins, payment for compensation and provision for \nother forms of social rehabilitation and resettlement in each site, if that be the case, must have been \nsatisfactorily completed by the EA and the lands cleared of obstructions and free of all encumbrances \nbefore ADB officially issues its \u201cno objection\u201d for the award of civil works contracts. The bureau of \neducation and training (BOETs) and the department of education and training (DOETs) will ensure \nthat resettlement activities do not overlap with the start of construction. All activities in RPs must be \ntime-bound. The NPIU and PPIUs will be jointly responsible for continuous internal monitoring of \nimplementation against the planned activities, time frames, and budgets. Since only minimal impact \nfrom land acquisition is expected from Component 1 of the Project, the external monitoring of RP \nimplementation by an external monitoring agency will not be required. \n \n9.  Implementation  Arrangements  and  Disclosure.  The  NPIU  will  recruit  an  international \nresettlement specialist (1 person-month) and a national resettlement specialist (10 person-months) to \nassist in the preparation and implementation of RPs in districts where land acquisition is unavoidable. \nDisclosure of the RF and any resulting RPs will follow ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071119165012+08'00'", "Author": "EI1", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071213094640+08'00'", "Title": "Lower Secondary Education for the Most Disadvantaged Regions Project", "Keywords": "rrp: 36008 vie, disadvantage regions lower secondary education, universal secondary education, socioeconomic development"}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December. \n(ii)  In Viet Nam, the school year (SY) ends on 31 May. \u201cSY\u201d before a calendar year \ndenotes the year in which the school year ends, e.g., SY2008 ends on 31 May 2009. \n(iii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \n \nVice President  C.
