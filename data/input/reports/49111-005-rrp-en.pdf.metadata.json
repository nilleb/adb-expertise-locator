I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Railway Efficiency Improvement Project. \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening of Management \nInformation Systems and Asset Management Capacity, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed project is the first project loan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Sri \nLanka\u2019s railway sector, and will finance high-impact subprojects to modernize the country\u2019s \nrailway  network  by  improving  the  operational  efficiency,  maintenance  capacity,  safety \nmanagement, skills development, and implementation capacity of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR). The \nmain components to be financed by the project include modern: (i) telecommunication system, (ii) \nticketing system, (iii) operations headquarters and train control center, (iv) railway workshops, (v) \nmaintenance equipment, (vi) housing blocks, and (vii) technical training center. By strengthening \nthe efficiency and sustainability of railway operations, the project will (i) promote  inclusive \neconomic growth and the development of competitive services and industries across Sri Lanka; \nand (ii) contribute to expanding the market share of railway transport and mitigating the impacts \nof road congestion, particularly in suburban Colombo. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country context. Sri Lanka benefits from an advantageous geographical position at the \ncrossroads of major maritime trade routes between Asia and Europe. It is densely populated with \nabout 346 people per square kilometer (km\u00b2), a land area of 62,710 km\u00b2, and a population of 21.7 \nmillion.1 Colombo is the center of commercial and administrative functions and accounts for 54.6% \nof  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  urban  population.  The Western  Province  includes  the  districts  of  Colombo, \nGampaha, and Kalutara, where 6.1 million people (28% of the country total) are concentrated on \n5.6% of the country\u2019s land area, and 38.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) is generated.2 \n \n4.  Economic performance. After a strong post-war recovery period, with annual GDP \ngrowth averaging 8.5% during 2009\u20132012, growth moderated to 4.1% during 2012\u20132018, and is \nforecast to continue at 4.1% in 2019.3 With a gross national income per capita of $3,840 in 2017, \nSri Lanka is on the path to achieving upper middle-income status, and the poverty headcount ratio \ndecreased from 22.7% of the population in 2002 to 4.1% in 2016. However, inadequate transport \ninfrastructure and services delivery hinders the development of industry and services, which \naccount for 91.8% of the GDP, and prevents Sri Lanka from leveraging its geographical position \nto increase its competitiveness and promote inclusive economic growth. Exports increased by \nonly 2.7% during 2007\u20132017, while imports increased by 7.3% in the same period. \n \n5.  Travel demand. The population of Sri Lanka is projected to stabilize at 25.0 million by \n2050.4 The rising affluence of the middle class is driving a rapid increase in motorization rates. \nThe total number of vehicles increased by 8.8% per year from 3.1 million to 7.2 million during \n2007\u20132017, with 67% of new cars registered in the Western Province. The stagnating efficiency \n                                                \n1  Compared with 1,265 people per km\u00b2 in Bangladesh, 450 in India, 204 in Nepal, 255 in Pakistan, and 135 in Thailand. \n2  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2018. Population Estimates by District. Colombo. \n3  ADB. 2019. Country Information Note: Sri Lanka. Manila. \n4  United Nations Population Fund. 2017. Population Dynamics and Development in Sri Lanka. Colombo. Driven by \ninternal migration, the population of the Western Province is forecast to increase to up to 8.8 million by 2030. ", "2 \nof the railway network has led to a decline in its market share to about 6% of passenger and 1% \nof freight demand in 2017 from a peak of 35% of passenger and 80% of freight markets. This \nresults in increasing congestion, particularly in the Western Province, where daily motorized trips \nare forecast to increase from 7.9 million trips in 2013 to 18.3 million by 2035, while roads cover \nonly about 10.7% of the urban area of Colombo.5 Significant investments are thus required to \nexpand the railway market share, in order to increase domestic trade, alleviate the growing \npressure on the road network, and mitigate the negative economic impacts of congestion. \n \n6.  Railway  network.  Colombo  is  the  central  node  of  the  railway,  road,  air,  and  port \ninfrastructure networks.6 Established in 1858, SLR owns and operates the railway network, and \nis administratively set up as a department of the Ministry of Transport & Civil Aviation (MOTCA). \nIn 2017, the railway network connected 343 stations along 1,568 kilometers (km) of broad-gauge \ntracks, and SLR operated about 351 passenger trains and 19 freight trains daily, transporting \n136.7 million passengers and 2.0 million tons of goods annually. Four suburban lines radiate out \nof Colombo, and the 230 km of tracks in the Western Province (16% of the country total) carry \nover 80% of railway passengers.7 SLR owns 250 diesel locomotives and multiple units, but only \n76% are operational and 49% of the fleet is more than 30 years old. Tracks and rolling stock suffer \nfrom corrosion due to airborne salinity, which hinders the potential for rehabilitation. Signaling \nmainly consists of an outdated mechanical interlocking system, and only 200 km of tracks in the \nWestern Province are under centralized control. The telecommunication system was installed in \n1985, and no spare parts have been received since 1998. Automation is limited, and most of the \nplanning, operating, and recording activities are done manually. \n \n7.  Operational  and  financial  performance.  SLR\u2019s  aging  infrastructure  hampers  its \noperational and financial performance, and in turn limits its investment and maintenance capacity. \nThe challenges SLR faces include (i) operational inefficiencies, with low average speeds, frequent \ndelays, insufficient train frequency, and over-capacity operation of trains in peak hours; (ii) \ninadequate maintenance capacity and a large maintenance backlog; (iii) a poor safety record, \nincluding a high incidence of encroachment on railway tracks and frequent accidents at level \ncrossings; and (iv) an inadequately trained workforce with low productivity and limited knowledge \nof new technologies.8 SLR\u2019s financial position is weak: passenger traffic generated about $35.7 \nmillion in 2017, or only $0.004 per passenger-km, and non-passenger revenues amounted to $7.5 \nmillion or $0.020 per ton-km.9 The operating ratio of 1.96 highlights the need to improve SLR\u2019s \nfinancial performance to strengthen its sustainability, notably by reducing operational losses, \nimproving governance, and leveraging land assets to develop new revenue streams. \n \n8.  Sector road map. The National Transport Policy, 2018, and the Public Investment \nProgramme, 2017\u20132020, provide directions for the railway sector and aim to modernize the \nrailway network, improve SLR\u2019s operational and financial performance, and increase the railway \n                                                \n5  Compared to 25.7% for Paris, 25.0% for London, 21.6% for Inner Tokyo, 13.6% for Seoul, and 7.1% for Bangkok. \nJapan International Cooperation Agency. 2014. Urban Transport Master Plan. Tokyo. \n6  In 2017, the dense road network comprised 12,400 km of national roads and highways, and 104,900 km of secondary \nroads. Colombo international airport handled 99% of the 9.8 million international air passengers, while short distances \nrestrict domestic air travel. Colombo port handled about 81.8 million tons of cargo, or 94.6% of the country total. \n7  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Sri Lanka Railway. 2018. Performance Report 2017. Colombo. \n8 Operational speeds in suburban Colombo are under 30 km per hour. Over 47% of passenger trains are delayed by \nan average of 35 minutes due to frequent failures of the signaling and telecommunication systems. A mean time \nbetween engine failures of 17 hours also results in 6% of trains being cancelled. More than 2,500 households live \nwithin 1 meter of railway tracks, notably on the Kelani Valley line. In 2017, there were 125 derailments, 196 recorded \ndeaths mainly due to collisions with pedestrians, in addition to over 38 cattle and 12 elephant deaths. \n9  Compared to revenues of $0.009 per passenger-km and $0.033 per ton-km in Bangladesh. In India, where freight \naccounts for 68.8% of total revenues, revenues are $0.006 per passenger-km and $0.025 per ton-km. \n ", "3 \nmarket share  to  10%  of  passenger  and  5%  of freight  demand  in  2020  by  leveraging the \ncompetitive advantage of rail transport in three market segments: suburban passenger services \nin Colombo and Kandy, freight transport, and competitive long-distance express services.10 \nInvestment priorities are to (i) rehabilitate and increase the rolling stock fleet; (ii) expand railway \nlines and improve track capacity; (iii) improve signaling and telecommunications; (iv) enhance \nrailway stations, and ticketing and information systems; (v) improve railway land management; \n(vi) increase private sector participation; and (vii) rationalize subsidies and tariffs. The program \ncomplements urban transport strategies for Colombo and the Western Province that aim to \ndevelop multimodal hubs and a rapid transit network.11 \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s interventions. The project is consistent with the objectives set out in the country \npartnership strategy, and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Sri Lanka, \n2019\u20132021.12 ADB aims to support the government\u2019s inclusive and sustainable growth strategy \nby (i) strengthening growth drivers to increase productivity and diversify economic activities; and \n(ii) reducing poverty and inequality, notably through more efficient, integrated, and sustainable \nrail transport. ADB plans to develop a long-term partnership with Sri Lanka in the railway sector, \nto improve its railway infrastructure, and strengthen SLR\u2019s institutional, operational and financial \ncapacity. ADB\u2019s interventions include (i) a TA approved in 2015 to prepare a prefeasibility study \nfor suburban railway improvements, which assisted in defining the outputs of the project; (ii) a TA \nloan, approved in 2016 to prepare feasibility and detailed design studies for four suburban lines; \nand (iii) a TA approved in 2017 to prepare a railway master plan that will include an institutional \ndevelopment plan, identify and prioritize investments, and develop operational, commercial, and \nfinancial strategies to improve SLR\u2019s sustainability.13 ADB is expected to finance the Kelani Valley \nline in 2021, followed by future improvements of the Main, Coast, and Puttalam lines. \n \n10.  Project design. The project was prepared to support immediate improvements in the \noperations, maintenance, safety, skills development, and implementation capacity of SLR. The \nproject will (i) address key operational bottlenecks with the modernization of the  ticketing, \ntelecommunication, operations headquarters, and train control center systems; (ii) upgrade the \nrailway workshop at Ratmalana, and procure rolling stock and track maintenance equipment; (iii) \nimprove railway safety, mainly through the construction of housing blocks to support the future \nresettlement of informal dwellers, and improvements of the Colombo Fort and Maradana stations; \n(iv) upgrade the Sri Lanka German Railway Technical Training Center (SLGRTTC), established \nin 1983 with support of the Federal Republic of Germany; and (v) support project implementation \ncapacity and readiness, notably for the future modernization of the Kelani Valley line and other \nsuburban lines. The project will increase the efficiency and attractiveness of the railway system, \nthus contributing to the improvement of SLR\u2019s market share and financial sustainability. \n \n11.  Value added by  ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s value addition includes improved railway \noperation  for  climate  change  mitigation,  and  enhanced  safety  and  maintenance  capacity. \nConsulting services packages will support the implementation of a land asset management and \nvalue capture strategy to develop new income streams, and the attached TA will improve \nmanagement information and maintenance planning capacity. \n                                                \n10  Government of Sri Lanka, MOTCA. 2018.

The project is aligned with the following impact: efficient, inclusive, safe, and sustainable \nmovement  of  people  and  goods  promoted  to  support  sustainable  economic  development \n(footnote  10,  Public  Investment  Programme). The  project  will  have  the following  outcome: \nefficiency, safety, and sustainability of railway operations in Sri Lanka improved.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Operational efficiency improved. The project will improve three operational \nbottlenecks by (i) procuring island-wide, long-term evolution telecommunications equipment to \nreplace the system installed in 1985, which does not reach all stations, and cannot communicate \nwith train drivers since the telegraph network was dismantled; (ii) installing a modern multichannel \n(paper, mobile, and smart card) system to replace the cumbersome ticketing system, which \nrequires more than 60,000 ticket combinations to be printed on custom-made paper; and (iii) \nconstructing a modern operations headquarters and train control center to replace both the \ncurrent headquarters, which cannot accommodate all operations departments of SLR, and the \noutdated control center opened in 1962 to monitor railway operations in the Western Province. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Maintenance  capacity  strengthened.  The  project  will  construct  three \nworkshops at SLR\u2019s main maintenance facility at Ratmalana for engine overhaul and testing and \nrepair of coach brakes. The project will also procure equipment to improve track and ballast \nalignments, locomotive engine cleaning, and motor parts repair. The attached TA will support the \ndevelopment of a detailed road map for the implementation of an asset maintenance strategy. \n \n15.  Output 3: Railway safety improved. The project will construct housing blocks to enable \nthe future resettlement of informal dwellers on the right-of-way of the Kelani Valley line.15 Over \n2,000 households live on the right-of-way within a meter of passing trains, resulting in frequent \naccidents and low operating speeds. The project will also upgrade an old railway underpass \nbetween two major stations in Colombo to improve traffic and pedestrian safety, and improve \npassenger safety and facilities at Colombo Fort and Maradana, the network\u2019s largest stations. \n \n16.  Output 4: Technical training center upgraded. The SLGRTTC will be upgraded with a \nnew training wing, a train simulator, and equipment packages to support the modernization of the \ncurrent four curricula and the development of six new curricula. The center, established in 1983, \nproduced 83 graduating students in 2017 from its four technical and vocational courses for \nmachinists, diesel engine mechanics, electricians, and welders. While it is well-maintained and \nprovides a valuable source of staff for SLR, its facilities and curricula need to be improved to \nsupport SLR\u2019s long-term modernization program and changing skill set requirements. \n \n17.  Output 5: Project implementation capacity and readiness of future railway projects \nstrengthened. The project will finance consulting services to (i) carry out a study on transit-\noriented development and land value capture, (ii) prepare a railway asset inventory and a land \nmanagement strategy, (iii) prepare a feasibility and detailed design study for the Kandy suburban \nrailway network, and (iv) provide safeguard and gender support for the preparation of upcoming \nprojects. Consulting firms and independent consultants will also be engaged for supervision, \nadvisory, and capacity-building services required for the implementation of outputs 1\u20134. \n                                                \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 Relocation will be carried out as part of a separate project for the Kelani Valley line. The project is under preparation \nwith ADB support, considered for ADB financing, and relocation will comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n ", "5 \nD.

It will address operational bottlenecks, \nreduce delays due to communication failures, decrease waiting times and operating costs with a \nmodern ticketing system, and improve traffic management. Safety will be strengthened, notably \nthrough the construction of housing blocks to support the future relocation of informal dwellers on \nthe right-of-way of existing lines. Improvements of the main workshop facilities at Ratmalana, and \nprocurement of track and rolling stock maintenance equipment are priority interventions for the \nlong-term improvement of SLR\u2019s maintenance capacity. Physical and institutional improvements \nto the SLGRTTC will support skills building for modern rail operations. The project was designed \nto garner external support by providing improvements with high external visibility, such as the \nticketing system, and internal institutional support by addressing operational gaps across most of \nSLR\u2019s subdepartments. The project also supports institutional capacity building to facilitate the \npreparation of pipeline projects, including the improvement of the Kelani Valley line, for which \ndetailed design studies are being prepared with ADB assistance (footnote 19). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic viability. The economic evaluation of the project was conducted in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines, by comparing life cycle costs in with- and without-project cases, using a \n9% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria.21 The project \nis expected to deliver significant benefits through travel time savings from improved operational \nefficiency, maintenance cost savings, vehicle operating cost savings from avoided road travel, \nsafety benefits, and greenhouse gas emission savings. The EIRR of the project is estimated at \n13.1%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the economic viability of the project \nunder adverse changes in costs and benefits, with the EIRR decreasing to 9.9% under the most \nsensitive scenario involving a 10% increase in capital costs and a 10% decrease in benefits. \n \n27.  Financial sustainability. The project was not designed to be revenue-generating, and as \nSLR is a government department, the financial analysis assessed its capacity to sustain the \nproject\u2019s incremental recurrent costs.22 In the context of a tight fiscal space, budgetary support \n                                                \n20 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n22 ADB. 2005. Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nhas been strong, and SLR\u2019s budget for recurrent expenses increased by 5.3% per year, in real \nterms, during 2012\u20132018. While operating revenues increased by 5.7% per year in the same \nperiod, the operating ratio of 1.96 indicates a potential sustainability gap. The annual life cycle \nincremental recurrent costs of the project components are estimated at $4.9 million, or 2.3% of \nSLR\u2019s overall budget. This represents a high sustainability risk, particularly for equipment and \ngoods that account for 73% of recurrent costs. To assist with maintenance liabilities, the contracts \nfor goods and equipment include up to 8 years of warranty and maintenance by the private sector. \n \n28.  The project will also attract additional demand and reduce unit operation and maintenance \ncosts, resulting in a net operating profit increase of $6.7 million, which is higher than the \nincremental recurrent costs of the project. Thus, the project is expected to have a net positive \nimpact on SLR\u2019s sustainability. However, the project\u2019s sustainability risk remains high, and the \nmaintenance of project assets will be monitored during implementation. The analysis strengthens \nthe need for strong support to the government in implementing the institutional, operational, tariff, \nand accounting reform action plan under preparation by the railway master plan (footnote 13). \nSupport  for  policy  reforms  will  be  actively  considered  for  ADB\u2019s  subsequent  large-scale \ninfrastructure investment project, planned in 2021 for the improvement of the Kelani Valley line. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  Institutional capacity. MOTCA is the executing agency, and has sufficient capacity and \nexperience to procure works and equipment, select consultants, and administer contracts. The \nPMU will be the primary implementing and management entity of the project. It was established \nto oversee feasibility and detailed design studies of four suburban railway lines in Colombo, and \nis headed by a project director, who reports to the secretary of MOTCA (footnote 19). SLR is a \ndepartment under MOTCA, and is headed by a general manager overseeing 13 subdepartments. \nSLR mainly focuses on its day-to-day operational requirements, and deputes technical staff to the \nPMU.  Frequent  meetings  are  held  with  the  Railway  Steering  Committee  to  ensure  close \ncollaboration with the PMU and SLR. The project will improve the capacity of the PMU in project \npreparation, implementation, accounting, and compliance with ADB requirements. The capacity \nof the PMU is being strengthened through consulting services contracts, which include training \nfor design, contract management, safeguards, and quality assurance. \n \n30.  Financial management. The financial management risk is assessed as moderate, as the \nPMU is successfully implementing an ongoing ADB project. However, project financial records \nare mostly maintained manually, and the PMU requires additional human resources and training. \nThe PMU has agreed to implement a financial management action plan that includes procurement \nof a management information system and training on disbursement, financial management, and \nADB\u2019s procedures. The attached TA will also prepare the modernization of SLR\u2019s management \ninformation system, which is a prerequisite for the introduction of management accounting in SLR. \n \n31.  Procurement. The assessment of the procurement capacity of the PMU has concluded \nthat it has a reasonable capacity to undertake procurement activities under the project, and the \noverall procurement risk is moderate. The PMU is staffed by officials from MOTCA and SLR who \nhave adequate procurement experience, and international consultants have been engaged to \nsupplement its technical capacity. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consulting firms will be \nrecruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. \nAdvance actions started in May 2018 for the recruitment of project implementation consultants, \nand in September 2018 for the procurement of the telecommunication and ticketing systems. \n ", "9 \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOTCA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Poverty. The project is expected to improve access to economic and social opportunities \nfor project beneficiaries, including train passengers across all ticketed classes, and freight \ntransport users. Although the project does not directly target the poor, it will support their mobility \nneeds, as the railway remains one of the most affordable transport modes in Sri Lanka. The \nproject is expected to have limited impacts on the incidence of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n34.  Gender. The project is categorized some gender elements. Women will benefit equally \nfrom the project as they are prominent railway users. The project\u2019s gender benefits include \nimproved public transport accessibility; improved access to services and markets; inclusive and \ngender-friendly improvements to railway stations and housing blocks for the elderly, women, \nchildren, and disabled users; and increased opportunities for skills development at the SLGRTTC. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). Six project components feature civil works: the construction \nof an office building, a training building, workshops, and housing blocks; the upgrading of a railway \nunderpass; and the improvement of two stations. No significant and irreversible environmental \nimpacts are expected, and impacts will be limited to the construction stage within the immediate \nvicinity of construction sites. Other anticipated impacts involve dust, noise, exhaust, construction \nand domestic waste, water contamination, occupational health and safety, erosion, siltation, and \ntraffic congestion during the construction of the underpass. The initial environmental examination, \nsubmitted  in  August  2018,  includes  a  composite  environmental  management  plan  and  a \ngrievance redress mechanism. Site-specific environmental management plans were prepared for \nall works components, will be included in respective bid documents, and provide mandatory \nmitigation measures to be implemented by contractors. Public consultations were carried out \nduring project preparation and will continue during implementation. A reduction of carbon dioxide \nemissions is expected due to the modal shift from road- to rail-based transport. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  All  civil  works  under  the  project  will  be \nundertaken on land owned by SLR, and no land acquisition is required. Due diligence conducted \nto determine the potential impacts of construction on structures and livelihoods on SLR land \nindicates that there are no private occupants or businesses on the sites. Hence, the project is not \nexpected to entail involuntary resettlement due to land acquisition or restriction of access. The \nproject implementation consultant will conduct periodic monitoring to verify that there are no \nadverse  impacts  during  implementation,  and  that  consultation,  information  disclosure,  and \ngrievance redress are carried out throughout the construction period. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Due diligence carried out during project preparation \nindicates that there are no indigenous peoples\u2019 communities in the urban and suburban project \nsites. Hence, no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected under the project. \n                                                \n23 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "10 \nF.
