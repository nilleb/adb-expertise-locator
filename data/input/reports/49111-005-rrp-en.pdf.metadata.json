proposed loan to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Railway Efficiency Improvement Project. \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening of Management \nInformation Systems and Asset Management Capacity, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe proposed project is the first project loan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Sri \n2. \nLanka\u2019s  railway  sector,  and  will  finance  high-impact  subprojects  to  modernize  the  country\u2019s \nrailway  network  by  improving  the  operational  efficiency,  maintenance  capacity,  safety \nmanagement, skills development, and implementation capacity of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR). The \nmain components to be financed by the project include modern: (i) telecommunication system, (ii) \nticketing system, (iii) operations headquarters and train control center, (iv) railway workshops, (v) \nmaintenance equipment, (vi) housing blocks, and (vii) technical training center. By strengthening \nthe  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  railway  operations,  the  project  will  (i)  promote  inclusive \neconomic growth and the development of competitive services and industries across Sri Lanka; \nand (ii) contribute to expanding the market share of railway transport and mitigating the impacts \nof road congestion, particularly in suburban Colombo. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nCountry context. Sri Lanka benefits from an advantageous geographical position at the \n3. \ncrossroads of major maritime trade routes between Asia and Europe. It is densely populated with \nabout 346 people per square kilometer (km\u00b2), a land area of 62,710 km\u00b2, and a population of 21.7 \nmillion.1 Colombo is the center of commercial and administrative functions and accounts for 54.6% \nof  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  urban  population.  The  Western  Province  includes  the  districts  of  Colombo, \nGampaha, and Kalutara, where 6.1 million people (28% of the country total) are concentrated on \n5.6% of the country\u2019s land area, and 38.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) is generated.2 \n \nEconomic  performance.  After  a  strong  post-war  recovery  period,  with  annual  GDP \n4. \ngrowth averaging 8.5% during 2009\u20132012, growth moderated to 4.1% during 2012\u20132018, and is \nforecast to continue at 4.1% in 2019.3 With a gross national income per capita of $3,840 in 2017, \nSri Lanka is on the path to achieving upper middle-income status, and the poverty headcount ratio \ndecreased from 22.7% of the population in 2002 to 4.1% in 2016. However, inadequate transport \ninfrastructure  and  services  delivery  hinders  the  development  of  industry  and  services,  which \naccount for 91.8% of the GDP, and prevents Sri Lanka from leveraging its geographical position \nto  increase  its  competitiveness  and  promote  inclusive  economic  growth.  Exports  increased  by \nonly 2.7% during 2007\u20132017, while imports increased by 7.3% in the same period. \n \n5. \nTravel demand. The population of Sri Lanka is projected to stabilize at 25.0 million by \n2050.4 The rising affluence of the middle class is driving a rapid increase in motorization rates. \nThe  total  number  of  vehicles increased  by  8.8% per  year from  3.1  million  to  7.2 million  during \n2007\u20132017, with 67% of new cars registered in the Western Province. The stagnating efficiency \n                                                \n1  Compared with 1,265 people per km\u00b2 in Bangladesh, 450 in India, 204 in Nepal, 255 in Pakistan, and 135 in Thailand. \n2  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2018. Population Estimates by District. Colombo. \n3  ADB. 2019. Country Information Note: Sri Lanka. Manila. \n4  United Nations Population Fund. 2017. Population Dynamics and Development in Sri Lanka. Colombo. Driven by \n\ninternal migration, the population of the Western Province is forecast to increase to up to 8.8 million by 2030. \n\n\fof the railway network has led to a decline in its market share to about 6% of passenger and 1% \nof freight demand in 2017 from a peak of  35% of passenger and 80% of freight markets. This \nresults in increasing congestion, particularly in the Western Province, where daily motorized trips \nare forecast to increase from 7.9 million trips in 2013 to 18.3 million by 2035, while roads cover \nonly  about  10.7%  of the  urban area  of  Colombo.5  Significant  investments  are  thus required to \nexpand  the  railway  market  share,  in  order  to  increase  domestic  trade,  alleviate  the  growing \npressure on the road network, and mitigate the negative economic impacts of congestion. \n \nRailway  network.  Colombo  is  the  central  node  of  the  railway,  road,  air,  and  port \n6. \ninfrastructure networks.6 Established in 1858, SLR owns and operates the railway network, and \nis administratively set up as a department of the Ministry of Transport & Civil Aviation (MOTCA). \nIn 2017, the railway network connected 343 stations along 1,568 kilometers (km) of broad-gauge \ntracks,  and  SLR  operated  about  351  passenger  trains  and  19  freight  trains  daily,  transporting \n136.7 million passengers and 2.0 million tons of goods annually. Four suburban lines radiate out \nof Colombo, and the 230 km of tracks in the Western Province (16% of the country total) carry \nover 80% of railway passengers.7 SLR owns 250 diesel locomotives and multiple units, but only \n76% are operational and 49% of the fleet is more than 30 years old. Tracks and rolling stock suffer \nfrom  corrosion  due to  airborne  salinity,  which  hinders  the  potential  for  rehabilitation.  Signaling \nmainly consists of an outdated mechanical interlocking system, and only 200 km of tracks in the \nWestern Province are under centralized control. The telecommunication system was installed in \n1985, and no spare parts have been received since 1998. Automation is limited, and most of the \nplanning, operating, and recording activities are done manually. \n \n7. \nOperational  and  financial  performance.  SLR\u2019s  aging  infrastructure  hampers  its \noperational and financial performance, and in turn limits its investment and maintenance capacity. \nThe challenges SLR faces include (i) operational inefficiencies, with low average speeds, frequent \ndelays,  insufficient  train  frequency,  and  over-capacity  operation  of  trains  in  peak  hours;  (ii) \ninadequate  maintenance  capacity  and  a  large  maintenance  backlog;  (iii)  a  poor  safety  record, \nincluding  a  high  incidence  of  encroachment  on  railway  tracks  and  frequent  accidents  at  level \ncrossings; and (iv) an inadequately trained workforce with low productivity and limited knowledge \nof new technologies.8 SLR\u2019s financial position is weak: passenger traffic generated about $35.7 \nmillion in 2017, or only $0.004 per passenger-km, and non-passenger revenues amounted to $7.5 \nmillion or $0.020 per ton-km.9 The operating ratio of 1.96 highlights the need to improve SLR\u2019s \nfinancial  performance  to  strengthen  its  sustainability,  notably  by  reducing  operational  losses, \nimproving governance, and leveraging land assets to develop new revenue streams. \n \nSector  road  map.  The  National  Transport  Policy,  2018,  and  the  Public  Investment \n8. \nProgramme,  2017\u20132020,  provide  directions  for  the  railway  sector  and  aim  to  modernize  the \nrailway network, improve SLR\u2019s operational and financial performance, and increase the railway \n\n                                                \n5  Compared to 25.7% for Paris, 25.0% for London, 21.6% for Inner Tokyo, 13.6% for Seoul, and 7.1% for Bangkok. \n\nJapan International Cooperation Agency. 2014. Urban Transport Master Plan. Tokyo. \n\n6  In 2017, the dense road network comprised 12,400 km of national roads and highways, and 104,900 km of secondary \nroads. Colombo international airport handled 99% of the 9.8 million international air passengers, while short distances \nrestrict domestic air travel. Colombo port handled about 81.8 million tons of cargo, or 94.6% of the country total. \n\n7  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Sri Lanka Railway. 2018. Performance Report 2017. Colombo. \n8  Operational speeds in suburban Colombo are under 30 km per hour. Over 47% of passenger trains are delayed by \nan average of  35 minutes due to frequent  failures of the signaling and telecommunication systems. A mean time \nbetween engine failures of 17 hours also results in 6% of trains being cancelled. More than 2,500 households live \nwithin 1 meter of railway tracks, notably on the Kelani Valley line. In 2017, there were 125 derailments, 196 recorded \ndeaths mainly due to collisions with pedestrians, in addition to over 38 cattle and 12 elephant deaths. \n\n9  Compared to revenues of $0.009 per passenger-km and $0.033 per ton-km in Bangladesh. In India, where freight \n\naccounts for 68.8% of total revenues, revenues are $0.006 per passenger-km and $0.025 per ton-km. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fmarket  share  to  10%  of  passenger  and  5%  of  freight  demand  in  2020  by  leveraging  the \ncompetitive advantage of rail transport in three market segments: suburban passenger services \nin  Colombo  and  Kandy,  freight  transport,  and  competitive  long-distance  express  services.10 \nInvestment priorities are to (i) rehabilitate and increase the rolling stock fleet; (ii) expand railway \nlines  and  improve  track  capacity;  (iii)  improve  signaling  and  telecommunications;  (iv)  enhance \nrailway stations, and ticketing and information systems; (v) improve railway land management; \n(vi) increase private sector participation; and (vii) rationalize subsidies and tariffs. The program \ncomplements  urban  transport  strategies  for  Colombo  and  the  Western  Province  that  aim  to \ndevelop multimodal hubs and a rapid transit network.11 \n \n9. \nADB\u2019s interventions. The project is consistent with the objectives set out in the country \npartnership strategy,  and  is  included  in ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan for  Sri  Lanka, \n2019\u20132021.12 ADB aims to support the government\u2019s inclusive and sustainable growth strategy \nby (i) strengthening growth drivers to increase productivity and diversify economic activities; and \n(ii) reducing  poverty  and  inequality,  notably  through more  efficient,  integrated,  and  sustainable \nrail transport. ADB plans to develop a long-term partnership with Sri Lanka in the railway sector, \nto improve its railway infrastructure, and strengthen SLR\u2019s institutional, operational and financial \ncapacity. ADB\u2019s interventions include (i) a TA approved in 2015 to prepare a prefeasibility study \nfor suburban railway improvements, which assisted in defining the outputs of the project; (ii) a TA \nloan, approved in 2016 to prepare feasibility and detailed design studies for four suburban lines; \nand (iii) a TA approved in 2017 to prepare a railway master plan that will include an institutional \ndevelopment plan, identify and prioritize investments, and develop operational, commercial, and \nfinancial strategies to improve SLR\u2019s sustainability.13 ADB is expected to finance the Kelani Valley \nline in 2021, followed by future improvements of the Main, Coast, and Puttalam lines. \n \n10. \nProject  design.  The  project  was  prepared  to  support  immediate  improvements  in  the \noperations, maintenance, safety, skills development, and implementation capacity of SLR. The \nproject  will  (i)  address  key  operational  bottlenecks  with  the  modernization  of  the  ticketing, \ntelecommunication, operations headquarters, and train control center systems; (ii) upgrade the \nrailway workshop at Ratmalana, and procure rolling stock and track maintenance equipment; (iii) \nimprove railway safety, mainly through the construction of housing blocks to support the future \nresettlement of informal dwellers, and improvements of the Colombo Fort and Maradana stations; \n(iv) upgrade the Sri Lanka German Railway Technical Training Center (SLGRTTC), established \nin 1983 with support of the Federal Republic of Germany; and (v) support project implementation \ncapacity and readiness, notably for the future modernization of the Kelani Valley line and other \nsuburban lines. The project will increase the efficiency and attractiveness of the railway system, \nthus contributing to the improvement of SLR\u2019s market share and financial sustainability. \n \n11. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  includes  improved  railway \noperation  for  climate  change  mitigation,  and  enhanced  safety  and  maintenance  capacity. \nConsulting services packages will support the implementation of a land asset management and \nvalue  capture  strategy  to  develop  new  income  streams,  and  the  attached  TA  will  improve \nmanagement information and maintenance planning capacity. \n\n                                                \n10  Government of Sri Lanka, MOTCA. 2018.

The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nefficiency, safety, and sustainability of railway operations in Sri Lanka improved.14 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Operational efficiency improved. The project will improve three operational \nbottlenecks  by  (i)  procuring  island-wide,  long-term  evolution  telecommunications  equipment  to \nreplace the system installed in 1985, which does not reach all stations, and cannot communicate \nwith train drivers since the telegraph network was dismantled; (ii) installing a modern multichannel \n(paper,  mobile,  and  smart  card)  system  to  replace  the  cumbersome  ticketing  system,  which \nrequires  more  than  60,000  ticket  combinations  to  be  printed  on  custom-made  paper;  and  (iii) \nconstructing  a  modern  operations  headquarters  and  train  control  center  to  replace  both  the \ncurrent  headquarters,  which cannot  accommodate  all  operations  departments  of SLR,  and the \noutdated control center opened in 1962 to monitor railway operations in the Western Province. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Maintenance  capacity  strengthened.  The  project  will  construct  three \nworkshops at SLR\u2019s main maintenance facility at Ratmalana for engine overhaul and testing and \nrepair  of  coach  brakes.  The  project  will  also  procure  equipment  to  improve  track  and  ballast \nalignments, locomotive engine cleaning, and motor parts repair. The attached TA will support the \ndevelopment of a detailed road map for the implementation of an asset maintenance strategy. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Railway safety improved. The project will construct housing blocks to enable \nthe future resettlement of informal dwellers on the right-of-way of the Kelani Valley line.15 Over \n2,000 households live on the right-of-way within a meter of passing trains, resulting in frequent \naccidents  and  low  operating  speeds.  The  project  will  also  upgrade  an  old  railway  underpass \nbetween  two  major  stations  in  Colombo  to  improve  traffic  and  pedestrian  safety,  and  improve \npassenger safety and facilities at Colombo Fort and Maradana, the network\u2019s largest stations. \n \nOutput 4: Technical training center upgraded. The SLGRTTC will be upgraded with a \n16. \nnew training wing, a train simulator, and equipment packages to support the modernization of the \ncurrent four curricula and the development of six new curricula. The center, established in 1983, \nproduced  83  graduating  students  in  2017  from  its  four  technical  and  vocational  courses  for \nmachinists, diesel engine mechanics, electricians, and welders. While it is well-maintained and \nprovides  a  valuable  source  of  staff  for  SLR,  its  facilities  and  curricula  need  to  be  improved  to \nsupport SLR\u2019s long-term modernization program and changing skill set requirements. \n \nOutput 5: Project implementation capacity and readiness of future railway projects \n17. \nstrengthened.  The  project  will  finance  consulting  services  to  (i)  carry  out  a  study  on  transit-\noriented development and land value capture, (ii) prepare a railway asset inventory and a land \nmanagement strategy, (iii) prepare a feasibility and detailed design study for the Kandy suburban \nrailway network, and (iv) provide safeguard and gender support for the preparation of upcoming \nprojects.  Consulting  firms  and  independent  consultants  will  also  be  engaged  for  supervision, \nadvisory, and capacity-building services required for the implementation of outputs 1\u20134. \n\n                                                \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 Relocation will be carried out as part of a separate project for the Kelani Valley line. The project is under preparation \nwith ADB support, considered for ADB financing, and relocation will comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $192.0  million  (Table  1).

It will address operational bottlenecks, \nreduce delays due to communication failures, decrease waiting times and operating costs with a \nmodern ticketing system, and improve traffic management. Safety will be strengthened, notably \nthrough the construction of housing blocks to support the future relocation of informal dwellers on \nthe right-of-way of existing lines. Improvements of the main workshop facilities at Ratmalana, and \nprocurement of track and rolling stock maintenance equipment are priority interventions for the \nlong-term improvement of SLR\u2019s maintenance capacity. Physical and institutional improvements \nto the SLGRTTC will support skills building for modern rail operations. The project was designed \nto garner  external  support  by  providing  improvements  with  high  external  visibility,  such  as the \nticketing system, and internal institutional support by addressing operational gaps across most of \nSLR\u2019s subdepartments. The project also supports institutional capacity building to facilitate the \npreparation  of  pipeline  projects,  including  the  improvement  of  the  Kelani  Valley  line,  for  which \ndetailed design studies are being prepared with ADB assistance (footnote 19). \n \nB. \n \n26. \nEconomic viability. The economic evaluation of the project was conducted in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines, by comparing life cycle costs in with- and without-project cases, using a \n9% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria.21 The project \nis expected to deliver significant benefits through travel time savings from improved operational \nefficiency, maintenance cost savings,  vehicle  operating  cost  savings from  avoided road  travel, \nsafety benefits, and greenhouse gas emission savings. The EIRR of the project is estimated at \n13.1%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the economic viability of the project \nunder adverse changes in costs and benefits, with the EIRR decreasing to 9.9% under the most \nsensitive scenario involving a 10% increase in capital costs and a 10% decrease in benefits. \n \nFinancial sustainability. The project was not designed to be revenue-generating, and as \n27. \nSLR  is  a  government  department,  the  financial  analysis  assessed  its  capacity  to  sustain  the \nproject\u2019s incremental recurrent costs.22 In the context of a tight fiscal space, budgetary support \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n20 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n22 ADB. 2005. Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nhas been strong, and SLR\u2019s budget for recurrent expenses increased by 5.3% per year, in real \nterms,  during  2012\u20132018.  While  operating  revenues  increased  by  5.7%  per  year  in  the  same \nperiod, the operating ratio of 1.96 indicates a potential sustainability gap. The annual life cycle \nincremental recurrent costs of the project components are estimated at $4.9 million, or 2.3% of \nSLR\u2019s  overall  budget.  This  represents  a  high  sustainability  risk,  particularly  for  equipment  and \ngoods that account for 73% of recurrent costs. To assist with maintenance liabilities, the contracts \nfor goods and equipment include up to 8 years of warranty and maintenance by the private sector. \n \nThe project will also attract additional demand and reduce unit operation and maintenance \n28. \ncosts,  resulting  in  a  net  operating  profit  increase  of  $6.7  million,  which  is  higher  than  the \nincremental recurrent costs of the project. Thus, the project is expected to have a net positive \nimpact on SLR\u2019s sustainability. However, the project\u2019s sustainability risk remains high, and the \nmaintenance of project assets will be monitored during implementation. The analysis strengthens \nthe need for strong support to the government in implementing the institutional, operational, tariff, \nand accounting reform action plan under preparation by the railway master plan (footnote  13). \nSupport  for  policy  reforms  will  be  actively  considered  for  ADB\u2019s  subsequent  large-scale \ninfrastructure investment project, planned in 2021 for the improvement of the Kelani Valley line. \n \nC. \n \nInstitutional capacity. MOTCA is the executing agency, and has sufficient capacity and \n29. \nexperience to procure works and equipment, select consultants, and administer contracts. The \nPMU will be the primary implementing and management entity of the project. It was established \nto oversee feasibility and detailed design studies of four suburban railway lines in Colombo, and \nis headed by a project director, who reports to the secretary of MOTCA (footnote 19). SLR is a \ndepartment under MOTCA, and is headed by a general manager overseeing 13 subdepartments. \nSLR mainly focuses on its day-to-day operational requirements, and deputes technical staff to the \nPMU.  Frequent  meetings  are  held  with  the  Railway  Steering  Committee  to  ensure  close \ncollaboration with the PMU and SLR. The project will improve the capacity of the PMU in project \npreparation, implementation, accounting, and compliance with ADB requirements. The capacity \nof the PMU is being strengthened through consulting services contracts, which include training \nfor design, contract management, safeguards, and quality assurance. \n \nFinancial management. The financial management risk is assessed as moderate, as the \n30. \nPMU is successfully implementing an ongoing ADB project. However, project financial records \nare mostly maintained manually, and the PMU requires additional human resources and training. \nThe PMU has agreed to implement a financial management action plan that includes procurement \nof a management information system and training on disbursement, financial management, and \nADB\u2019s procedures. The attached TA will also prepare the modernization of SLR\u2019s management \ninformation system, which is a prerequisite for the introduction of management accounting in SLR. \n \n31. \nProcurement. The assessment of the procurement capacity of the PMU has concluded \nthat it has a reasonable capacity to undertake procurement activities under the project, and the \noverall procurement risk is moderate. The PMU is staffed by officials from MOTCA and SLR who \nhave  adequate  procurement  experience,  and  international  consultants  have  been  engaged  to \nsupplement  its  technical  capacity.  Procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  consulting  firms  will  be \nrecruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. \nAdvance actions started in May 2018 for the recruitment of project implementation consultants, \nand in September 2018 for the procurement of the telecommunication and ticketing systems. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n32. \nwith the government and MOTCA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n \n33. \nPoverty. The project is expected to improve access to economic and social opportunities \nfor  project  beneficiaries,  including  train  passengers  across  all  ticketed  classes,  and  freight \ntransport users. Although the project does not directly target the poor, it will support their mobility \nneeds,  as  the  railway  remains  one  of  the  most  affordable  transport  modes  in  Sri  Lanka.  The \nproject is expected to have limited impacts on the incidence of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \nGender. The project is categorized  some gender elements. Women will benefit equally \n34. \nfrom  the  project  as  they  are  prominent  railway  users.  The  project\u2019s  gender  benefits  include \nimproved public transport accessibility; improved access to services and markets; inclusive and \ngender-friendly  improvements  to  railway  stations  and  housing  blocks  for  the  elderly,  women, \nchildren, and disabled users; and increased opportunities for skills development at the SLGRTTC. \n \nE. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n36. \nEnvironment (category B). Six project components feature civil works: the construction \nof an office building, a training building, workshops, and housing blocks; the upgrading of a railway \nunderpass;  and the  improvement  of two stations.  No  significant  and  irreversible environmental \nimpacts are expected, and impacts will be limited to the construction stage within the immediate \nvicinity of construction sites. Other anticipated impacts involve dust, noise, exhaust, construction \nand domestic waste, water contamination, occupational health and safety, erosion, siltation, and \ntraffic congestion during the construction of the underpass. The initial environmental examination, \nsubmitted  in  August  2018,  includes  a  composite  environmental  management  plan  and  a \ngrievance redress mechanism. Site-specific environmental management plans were prepared for \nall  works  components,  will  be  included  in  respective  bid  documents,  and  provide  mandatory \nmitigation  measures  to  be  implemented  by  contractors.  Public  consultations  were  carried  out \nduring project preparation and will continue during implementation. A reduction of carbon dioxide \nemissions is expected due to the modal shift from road- to rail-based transport. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  All  civil  works  under  the  project  will  be \nundertaken on land owned by SLR, and no land acquisition is required. Due diligence conducted \nto  determine  the  potential  impacts  of  construction  on  structures  and  livelihoods  on  SLR  land \nindicates that there are no private occupants or businesses on the sites. Hence, the project is not \nexpected to entail involuntary resettlement due to land acquisition or restriction of access. The \nproject  implementation  consultant  will  conduct  periodic  monitoring  to  verify  that  there  are  no \nadverse  impacts  during  implementation,  and  that  consultation,  information  disclosure,  and \ngrievance redress are carried out throughout the construction period. \n \n38. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). Due diligence carried out during project preparation \nindicates that there are no indigenous peoples\u2019 communities in the urban and suburban project \nsites. Hence, no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected under the project. \n\n                                                \n23 ADB.

The project will support the modernization of the technical \ntraining center of SLR and was designed to support all subdepartments of SLR. \nSri Lanka\u2019s debt service repayments are expected to significantly increase during \n2019\u20132027, and credit rating agencies downgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s rating in December \n2018. The grace period of the loan will be increased to 8 years to assist with the \nsustainability of Sri Lanka\u2019s outstanding debt repayments. \nThe government has consistently provided the budget to cover recurrent expenses \nof SLR, which is a department under its parent ministry. Railway fares were \nincreased by 15% on 1 October 2018, and the Asian Development Bank is \nsupporting the preparation of a tariff formula. The project will assess the \ndevelopment of additional revenue streams through land value capture. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe government and MOTCA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n40. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n41. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n\nThe government and MOTCA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n42. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$160,000,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Railway  Efficiency \nImprovement Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a  term  of  29  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n16 July 2019 \n\n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEfficient, inclusive, safe, and sustainable movement of people and goods promoted to support sustainable \neconomic development (Public Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020)a \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\nResults Chain \n\nOutcome \nEfficiency, safety, \nand sustainability \nof railway \noperations in Sri \nLanka improved \n\nOutputs \n1.
