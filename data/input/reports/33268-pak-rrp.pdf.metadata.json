New \nfarm  and  community \nconstruction  and  upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure  for \nproduction, water consumption, and transportation represent \nsignificant  aspects  of  the  Project.  Project  management  will \noperate  closely  with  government  line  departments  and  the \nProject will be implemented through community participation \ninvolvement \nto \nin  designing  and \nimplementing \ninterventions.

The poor farm \nand livestock productivity, and consequent poverty, restrains \ntransition  from  below-subsistence  livelihoods.  Capacity  and \nthe  ability  to  explore  other  opportunities  are  restricted  by \npoor  access  to  productive  and  physical  infrastructure.  The \ndegradation of the physical environment, if not checked, will \nworsen the situation.  \n\nthe  pervasive  poverty \n\nimprove  community \n\nline  departments \n\nproject \n\nfor \n\nto \n\nin \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment Assessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fto \n\nfor \n\nstrengthen \n\neffective \nfocused \n\nproduction \nand \non \n\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  improve  the  productive  potential \nof  selected  micro-watersheds  and  their  associated  natural \nresource  base;  and \nthe  planning, \nimplementation,  and  management  capacity  of  the  target \ncommunities  and  implementing  departments  in  the  project \narea.

A project manager will head each project \ntechnical \nimplementation  unit.  Consultants,  contracted \nservices,  and \nrequisite \nline  departments  will  provide \ntechnical support. \n \nRequisite  goods,  works,  and  services  will  be  procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works \nrelated  to  the  community  infrastructure  component  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures or other procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nA \ntotal  of  147  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  21  person-months  of  international  and  126 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultant  inputs,  will  support \nproject implementation. In addition, service contracts will be \nawarded  to  undertake  certain  specialized  project  activities. \nThe  Government  will  engage  consulting  services \nin \nthe  Use  of \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Quality-and  cost-\nbased  selection  procedures  will  be  used  in  recruiting  the \nconsultants.  \n \nThe  Project  will  generate  significant  quantifiable  and \nnonquantifiable  benefits.  Effective  implementation  of  the \nProject  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  household  incomes. \nFarm and livestock packages will increase the productivity of \nabout 52,500 hectares on rain-fed (barani) lands and benefit \naround  37,500  households.  It  will  also  strengthen  food \nsecurity and improve the nutritional status of farm families. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\finvolves \n\nintegrated  approach \n\nthe  complementary \nThe \nmanagement  of  natural  resources,  agriculture,  and  range \nmanagement. Effective forestry and range management will \nensure  water  harvesting  and  recharge  of  groundwater \nresources,  check  soil  erosion,  and  provide  forage  and \nfoliage  to  livestock.  The  construction  and  rehabilitation  of \nirrigation  and  small-scale  water  storage  structures  will \nensure  the  availability  of  irrigation  and  drinking  water \nsupplies.  Improved  farming  and  livestock  rearing  practices \nand  additional  income  from  rehabilitation  of  the  natural \nenvironment  are  livelihood  strategies  that  will  be  made \navailable for the benefit of individual households. The target \npopulation  will  obtain  access  to  opportunities  for  improving \ntheir  livelihoods,  broaden  their  networks  of  knowledge  and \ncontacts  with  service  providers,  and  learn  more  productive \nfarming  practices  with  all  the  community  sharing  access  to \nnew and improved supporting infrastructure. \n \nKey  assumptions  are  that  (i)  the  project  area  remains \naccessible  vis-\u00e0-vis  security  and \nfor  development;  (ii) \npolitical administrations will provide positive support; (iii) the \nsociocultural  system  accepts  the  poverty  reduction  focus \nand  participatory  approach,  which  is  critical  to  project \nsuccess;  and  (iv)  the  agency-based  technical  departments \nand communities are willing to adopt the watershed planning \napproach.  The  Project  also  assumes \nthe  client \ncommunities  will  accept  their  role  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of the infrastructure interventions. \n \nRisks  include  the  watershed  approach  not  resulting  in \nreduced  soil  erosion,  increased  groundwater  recharge, \nincreased  surface  water  for  supplemental  irrigation,  and \nimproved  soil  fertility.  Complementary  investments  may  not \noccur at the micro-watershed level, particularly for rural link \nand  access \nroads.  Secretariat  and  agency-based \nadministrators  and  technical  staff  may  not  utilize  the \nproject  imparted  training  to  function  as  effective  partners  in \nthe development process. Selected interventions will be site-\nspecific;  the  approach  and  interventions  will  be  piloted \nduring  the  first  year  of  the  Project.  Proposed  intensive \nevaluations  and  detailed  assessments  will  result  in  a \nfeedback loop to allow continual learning and adjustments to \nproject implementation.  \n \n\nthat \n\nRisks and

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas  (FATA)  Rural \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis1 \n\n2. \nPoverty  in  Pakistan  is  a  predominantly  rural  phenomenon.  Approximately  77%  of  the \npopulation and the vast majority of the nation's poor reside in rural areas. Most derive their living \nfrom  agriculture  and  off-farm  employment.  Agriculture  remains  the  single  largest  sector  of  the \neconomy, and is the most important sector for employment and income generation. The sector \naccounts for about 26% of real gross domestic product and approximately 50% of employment. \nGrowth  in  the  sector  has  stagnated  over  the  past  few  years,  although  it  is  likely  to  remain  the \nprimary  contributor  for  some  time.  An  uncertain  policy  environment  (especially  concerning  the \nprices  and  marketing  of  major  crops)  combined  with  widespread  resource  degradation  has \ncontributed  to  low  productivity  and  profitability.  Other  contributors  to  the  sector's  performance \ninclude  low  quality  inputs,  poor  quality  of  support  services,  inefficient  water  resource \nmanagement, and inadequate rural infrastructure. \n \n3. \nFATA\u2019s pervasive poverty has not been statistically documented. The Pakistan integrated \nhousehold  survey  has  not  been  implemented  in  FATA  and  no  statistically  valid  surveys  or \nsamples  are  available.  While  this  has  been  a  distinct  frustration  for  government  planners,  the \nsituation is far from unclear. Rural residents receive few social services; drinking water is in short \nsupply throughout the region, a condition reflected in high infant and child mortality; and village \nsanitation is inadequate. Educational facilities are deficient in most villages and nonexistent for \nmost girls. Most children do not attend school at all, and literacy rates are among the lowest in \nthe  country.  Health  facilities  are  substandard  at  best  and  usually  not  available  at  all.  Factors \nunderlying  the  region's  poverty  include  (i)  historical,  political,  and  social  isolation;  (ii)  a  legal \nsystem reliant on executive and judicial authority administered through civil servants preferring to \nmaintain  the  status  quo;  (iii)  poor  quality  and  coverage  of  institutions  responsible  for  the \nprovision of basic services; (iv) social practices that preclude women\u2019s participation in economic \nlife; and (v) lack of effective institutions for skill training to enable the labor force to shift from low- \nto high-productivity sectors. These factors substantially mirror those detailed for the rural areas \nin the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy.2 \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nFATA  runs  in  a  narrow  belt  along  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  border.  It  consists  of seven \n4. \nagencies3  and  six  bordering  frontier  regions,4  and  is  of  immense  geostrategic  and  political \nimportance. Acceding to Pakistan at partition from India with the understanding that they would \nremain  autonomous,  they  are  characterized  by  cultural  conservatism  and  adherence  to  tribal \nvalues  and  practices.  Although  directly  administered  by  the  federal  Government,  the  people \nmaintain  strong  kinship  alliances  and  economic  linkages  with  neighboring  Afghanistan.

Islamabad. \n3  An agency is an administrative unit equivalent to a district. \n4   FATA  comprises  seven  agencies  (Bajaur,  Khyber,  Kurram,  Mohmand,  North  Waziristan,  Orakzai,  and  South \n\nWaziristan), and the frontier regions of Bannu, D. I. Khan, Kohat, Lakki, Peshawar, and Tank. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nproject  area  consists  of  the  three  northern  FATA  agencies  of  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand. \nThese  have  almost  half  (46%)  of  the  estimated  population  of  FATA  and  half  of  the  cultivated \narea (49%), within slightly less than one quarter of the land area. About 70% of the land is not \nsuitable for farming; much of it is dry and rocky. About 20% of Bajaur\u2019s farmed area has some \nirrigation, but 4% or less of the farmed area of Khyber and Mohmand. With the exception of the \nlarger towns and villages of Khyber Agency, which borders Peshawar and has significant trading \nactivity  across  the  Khyber  Pass,  the  population  of  the  project  area  is  rural,  distributed  in  over \n1,200 villages (Appendix 2). \n \n5. \nIn  the  project  area  the  poorest  families  earn  their  living  from  small  farms  as \nsharecroppers,  or  through  agricultural  wage  labor.  Members  of  family  groups  work  at  many \nactivities,  including  agriculture  and  animal  husbandry,  firewood  collection,  local  wage  or \ncraftwork,  and  small  enterprises  like  tailoring  or  tending  small  shops.  Sharecroppers  are \nobligated  to  provide  most  of  their  own  and  their  family\u2019s  labor  to  agricultural  production  on  the \nland  allocated  to  them,  but  under  certain  conditions  they  undertake  wage  labor.  Women \ncontribute a significant portion of the agricultural labor force through their involvement in a broad \nrange  of  agricultural  activities,  but  their  contribution  is  not  officially  recognized.  Most  individual \nresidents do not participate in decisions regarding development activities and community needs \nare not necessarily reflected in decisions. Few linkages are available to the outside world, and \nvery few organizations or networks are available by which individuals or communities can seek \nand  gain  alternative  ideas,  or  express  their  needs.  The  persistence  of  patriarchal  and \nconservative societal values and related gender-discriminatory practices affect women's access \nto basic social services and productive resources in the project area. Women have virtually no \nchance  to  form  networks  or  support  organizations,  or  become  part  of  community  self-help \ngroups;  and  are  not  included  in  land  and  water  resource  decision-making  processes. \nFurthermore 5\u20137% of households are headed by women, mostly widows; these households are \namong the poorest.  \n \nThe Agricultural Census (2000) reports that only about 30% of the land is in \u201cfarm area,\u201d \n6. \na  broad  classification  of  land  under  ownership  and  use,  mostly  under  rain-fed  conditions.  The \ncategory includes forests, but does not entirely account for rangelands. Individual ownership of \nagricultural  land  is  recognized,  while  the  range  and  forests  are  communal.  Communal  land \n(shamilat)  consists  of  grasses,  shrubs,  and  scattered  trees  managed  by  the  community  for \nanimal  grazing,  fuelwood  collection,  timber  harvesting,  and  other  nonwood  forest  products  and \nservices. The Pakistan Forest Act 1927 and other forestry rules and regulations do not extend to \nFATA.  \n \n7. \nFATA's natural capital has degraded over recent years. On both private agricultural and \ncommunal rangelands, the degradation process is obvious, with low agricultural productivity, loss \nof vegetation, accelerated sheet and gully erosion, and low moisture retention capacity. The lack \nof water creates a dangerous positive feedback cycle as vegetation cover is removed, resulting \nin  low  water  absorption  and  retention  capacity,  and  inability  to  support  vegetation.  In  certain \nareas, due to the poor productivity of land, local residents and desperate Afghan refugees have \ncultivated marginal lands, with a resultant further loss of fertility.  \n \n8. \nOnly  a  limited  development  effort  has  been  devoted  to  FATA  over  many  years,  as \nevidenced  by  a  declining  rate  of  growth  of  real  per  capita  public  expenditure  since  the  mid-\n1990s,  a  situation  that  appears  to  have  changed,  with  major  increases  in  the  2003\u20132004  and \n2004\u20132005 budget cycles. Infrastructure, particularly blacktopped roads, has improved in FATA \nover  the  last  2  years,  primarily  as  a  result  of  military  activities  in  the  region.  However,  a \nsignificant part of FATA remains devoid of adequate road access. Drinking water sourced from \nwithin the villages is available to 60\u201370% of households, but the volume and quality are not high. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nAbout a third of these households have water within their house compounds\u2014either piped or by \nwell. Irrigation water is much sought after and creates an income surplus for those with access; \nbut irrigation systems are not efficient, the practices are wasteful, and the water table continues \nto  subside,  either  as  a  result  of  drought  or  because  of  existing  tubewells  overexploiting  the \naquifer.  The  lack  of  communication  networks,  schools,  and  health  facilities  reflects  the  local \ndecision-making  process  in  which  the  balance  of  interest  among  kinship  groups,  factional \nrivalries, and political groupings determines investment.  \n \nIn Pakistan overall, during the 1990s to the present, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n9. \nand other funding agencies have had varied and extensive involvement in agriculture and rural \ndevelopment.  These  interventions  (Appendix  3)  aimed  at  enhancing  agricultural  productivity, \npromoting  market-oriented  policy  reforms,  strengthening  the  institutional  framework,  and \ndeveloping resource-scarce areas of the country. Experience with this assistance indicates that, \nin  general,  project  impact  is  reduced  when  inadequate  focus  is  placed  on  consultation  with \nbeneficiaries,  ownership,  flexibility  in  project  design,  sequencing  and  prioritization,  capacity, \ndysfunctional  systems  of  the  project  implementing  agencies,  and  postproject  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M).  Some  projects  experienced  considerable  delays  and  revisions  in  design \nand  scope  due  to  (i)  limited  availability  and  untimely  release  of  local  funds;  (ii)  late  starts  and \nprotracted  implementation  delays  due  to  political  disruption  and  security  problems;  and  (iii) \ndesign deficiencies arising from lack of information or inadequate attention to the legal, political, \ninstitutional,  and  sociocultural  environment.  Lessons  learned  also  indicate  that  to  have  an \nimpact,  rural  development  projects  should  be  implemented  using  a  phased  approach, \nparticipatory  impact  assessments  should  be  carried  out  from  time  to  time,  and  the  designed \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  systems  should  be  simple  and  not  beyond  the  comprehension  of \nproject implementation entities. Lastly, ownership of the development activities and their O&M by \nthe  communities  is  essential  for  sustainability.  In  light  of  these  lessons,  the  Project  ensures  (i) \nfuller  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  project  design  and  implementation  leading  to  greater \nownership,  (ii)  a  process-based  approach,  (iii)  localized  implementation  arrangements  with \ncapacity  support  to  government  and  community  groups  for  implementation  and  maintenance, \nand (iv) use of robust technology. \n \n10. \nThe Project is in line with the Government\u2019s vision and development goals articulated in \nthe Medium Term Development Framework and its Poverty Reduction Strategy. A key objective \nis  to  accelerate  gross  domestic  product  growth,  reduce  unemployment,  and  eliminate  poverty. \nThe Government's target is to reduce absolute poverty from 30% in 2001 to 15% by 2011. ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy is based on Pakistan\u2019s development goals and priorities for poverty reduction.5 \nIt also incorporates ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction and lessons learned from \npast operational experience in Pakistan. The strategy attaches importance to reviving growth in \nPakistan,  with  a  focus  on  interventions  aimed  at  promoting  growth  in  sectors  or  activities  that \nhave maximum poverty reduction impact, including rural development. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe Project is to (i) improve the productive potential of participating watersheds and their \nassociated natural resource base; (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities in the project area \nto  participate  in  planning,  implementation,  social  and  environmental  management,  and \nmaintenance  of  assets  emanating  from  local  development  programs;  and  (iii)  support  the \nimplementing  departments  in  the  project  area  to  operate  in  a  more  socially  inclusive  manner \n\n                                                 \n5   The Project first appeared in the 2002\u20132004 Country Strategy and Program.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nwithin  the  framework  of  a  convergent  watershed  development  planning  process.  This  will  be \naccomplished  by  having  community  groups  implement  most  of  the  subprojects  using  the \nProject's  collaborative  approach  and  capacity-building  initiatives.  The  Project  will  target  poor \ncommunities,  and  establish  an  institutional  base  for  planning  and  implementing  multisector \nactivities  to  improve  their  livelihoods.  The  Project  will  operate  in  18  tehsils  (subdistricts) \nrepresenting approximately 1,200 communities. The project area has a population of slightly less \nthan 1.5 million; at least 900,000 are living below the Government's official poverty line.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe Project includes three components: (i) integrated resource management to facilitate \nthe  sustainable  increase  in  production  from  renewable  natural  resources;  (ii)  community \ninfrastructure  to  improve  crop  production  and  transportation;  and  (iii)  project  planning, \nmanagement,  and  support  to  strengthen  agency  planning,  implementation,  and  capacity  for \nimproved  service  delivery  to  communities.  Communities  in  the  project  area  do  not  have \nexperience  with  development  interventions;  thus  the  Project  aims  to  build  a  broad  alliance \nbetween  communities  and  government  to  address  long-term  needs  for  improving  farm \nproduction  and  incomes,  reversing  environmental  degradation,  and  improving  watershed \nmanagement.  Priority  will  be  given  to  activities  with  immediate  impacts  to  establish  community \nconfidence. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Integrated Resource Management \n\ntrain \n\nin  new  agricultural \n\nfarmers  and  extension  agents \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  assistance  for  identifying  and  selecting  appropriate  agricultural \n13. \ntechniques \ntechnologies,  and \n(Supplementary Appendix A). The main target group comprises small landholders and farmers, \nsome  with  and  some  without  irrigation  water.  Formation  of  a  community  organization,  or  water \nuser  association,  is  a  prerequisite  to  their  participation.  The  short-term  impact  of  initial \nrecommendations  will  be  significant,  since  with  project  support,  farmers  can  achieve  yield \nincreases  in  a  single  season  with  small  introductions  of  relatively  inexpensive  high-yielding \nvarieties, improved seed usage, judicial use of fertilizer, and adoption of better crop management \npractices.6   \n \n14. \nFarming  systems  in  the  project  area  are  rain-fed  (barani),  subsistence  production,  or \nirrigated  production  that  produces  a  marketable  surplus.  The  rain-fed  system  is  low  input,  low \noutput, high risk, and dependant on infrequent and unreliable rainfall. Irrigated farming is more \nstable  and  productive  of  food  grains,  providing  potential  cash  alternatives  such  as  vegetable \nraising  or  fruit  production.  Livestock  production  is  integral  to  both  systems,  with  crop  residue \nproviding  a  major  source  of  animal  feed,  especially  for  milk  production,  which  is  important  for \nhousehold consumption or sale. Where irrigation is available, the potential for filling a seasonal \nniche in vegetable production is good. Fodder crops are important for livestock production, while \ncrop residues form a large part of livestock feed, converting agricultural leavings into milk, meat, \nand  marketable  savings.  Adequate  fodder  is  a  concern  of  all  farmers,  especially  those  with  no \nirrigation.  \n\n                                                 \n6  The  Project  will  build  on  positive  experiences,  including  those  of  the  development  programs  implemented  by  the \nNarcotics Affairs Section of the Government of the United States. These have demonstrated farmer acceptance of \nhigh-yielding varieties. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\na. \n\nFarming Systems and Crop Production \n\n15. \nThe  subcomponent  includes  (i)  improved  seed  technology  and  farming  demonstrations, \n(ii)  training  of  trainers  and  farmer  field  training  in  integrated  crop  management,  (iii)  adaptive \nresearch  trials,  and  (iv)  varietal  screening  of  specific  seeds.  The  existing  and  tested  model  of \nintegrated  crop  management  through  farmer  field  schools  will  be  followed.  Working  through \ncommunity  organizations,  on-farm  adaptive  trials  on  farmer\u2019s  fields  for  key  crops  will  improve \nproductivity.  Seed  block  demonstrations  for  wheat  and  maize  varieties  through  \u201cterms  of \npartnership\u201d  between  farmer  groups  and  the  relevant  agency  will  serve  as  testing  areas  and \ndemonstration  schools  for  farmers.  Adaptive  research  trials  are  the  basis  for  farmers  to  verify \nand accept appropriate technologies. Good varieties for local testing are available in North-West \nFrontier  Province  (NWFP)  for  wheat,  barley,  maize,  sugarcane,  rice,  and  okra  (bhindi). \nScreening onion and tomato varieties on farmers\u2019 fields will create a valuable synergy between \nresearch  and  practice,  where  the  optimal  varieties  for  local  conditions  are  unknown.  Line \ndepartment capabilities in these extension techniques will be strengthened through training and \nexperience. \n \n\nb. \n\nLivestock and Fodder Development \n\n16. \nLivestock production is an integral part of the farming system for most households in the \nproject area, whether owners, tenants, or the landless. Livestock are closely integrated with the \nexisting  farming  systems  since  livestock  depend  on  crop  residues.  Women  contribute \nsignificantly to livestock management, but their skills and knowledge are traditional and limited. \nVillage  knowledge  of  animal  nutrition  and  health  practices  is  minimal,  with  virtually  no  links  to \nformal sources of information about disease, medicines, or developments in veterinary services. \nMost of these health problems are preventable, and could be treated at the village through timely \nvaccination and deworming. The Department of Livestock and Dairy Development faces severe \nconstraints  in  providing  appropriate  animal  health  services.7  Subsidized  vaccination,  artificial \ninsemination,  and  feed  analysis  are  the  only  public  support  to  producers  and  even  these  are \nlimited  by  inadequate  budgets.  Few  local  staff  are  actually  working  in  the  more  distant  areas, \nthus local residents need to be trained as village veterinary health workers.8  \n \nAccordingly,  the  subcomponent  will  focus  on  providing  community  training  and \n17. \nknowledge  transfer  on  animal  nutrition  and  animal  husbandry  practices  through  (i)  analysis, \nplanning,  and  capacity  building  for  line  department  staff;  (ii)  improved  fodder  and  forage \nproduction;  and  (iii)  training  of  village  animal  husbandry  workers,  including  women.  Increasing \nper  animal  productivity  through  better  nutrition  lowers  the  need  for  more  animals  in  herds  or \nhouseholds,  reduces  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  provides  scope  for  reversing  the \nrangeland  degradation  process.  Nutrition  activities  will  increase  available  fodder  and  improve \nforage production. Straw enrichment and fodder preservation techniques such as hay and silage \nmaking will enhance year-round availability of feed. Fodder as a cash crop will be encouraged. \nHigh-quality  forage  at  strategic  points,  and  using  off-season  feed  from  otherwise unused  lands \nwill reduce the burden on overgrazed ranges.  \n\n                                                 \n7  Constraints include (i) a restricted operating budget, (ii) limited access to project areas due to lack of transport, (iii) \nlack  of  vaccines  and  medicines,  (iv)  difficulty  in  obtaining  timely  laboratory  backup,  (v)  lack  of  quantitative \nknowledge of the patterns of occurrence of diseases and their economic importance, (vi) lack of appropriate animal \nhealth delivery models specifically tailored to existing farming and grazing systems, and (vii) lack of a broad-based \nextension program for dairy production. \n\n8  The  combined  number  of  officers  and  veterinary  assistants  to  the  livestock  head  count  are  about  1  to  6,100  in \nMohmand, 1 to 7,300 in Bajaur, and 1 to 15,600 in Khyber. These numbers overwhelm any realistic effort to provide \ndirect veterinary assistance through the government agency. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nc. \n\nCommunity Forestry and Range Management \n\n18. \nThe subcomponent aims to (i) integrate farm forestry activities within the existing farming \nsystem;  (ii)  rehabilitate  and  develop  denuded  community  lands  through  improved  vegetative \ncover; (iii) introduce the participatory and multiple use concept of forest management in existing \nscrub forests to diversify both wood and nonwood forest products and services; and (iv) build the \ntechnical, social, institutional, and entrepreneurial capacity of small farmers of the project area, \nincluding women, in plant nursery operations, tree planting, forest management, and controlled \ngrazing. \n \n19. \nFarm forestry activities include seedling production, tree planting, management, and tree \nwood  utilization  concentrated  on  fast-growing,  drought-resistant  trees.  Private  (home-based) \nnurseries will provide the community with preferred forest species for planting on farmland, and \nwill  be  supported  by  technical  and  market  information.  Field  nurseries  will  provide  income \nopportunities for women and families who manage them. Trees will be mainly forest varieties, but \ngrowers  will  be  free  to  raise  fruit  and  ornamental  plants,  as  well  as  fodder  trees  for  livestock, \ndepending  on  the  need.  About  900  home-based  and  200  field  nurseries  will  produce  sufficient \nseedlings  for  farm  and  community  forestry,  and  provide  income  for  3,000  direct  and  indirect \nbeneficiaries.  Benefits  to  the  water  table  and  reforestation  will  have  local  and  regional  impact. \nNew  plantations  will  be  established  on  community  land  under  terms  of  partnership  with \ncommunity  organizations  that  define  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  responsibilities. \nCommunities will define and agree on the distribution of benefits. The Department of Forestry will \nraise plantations on a pilot basis; community groups can then choose to adopt them on a larger \nscale.  Plantations  will  fulfill  subsistence  needs,  and  will  generate  additional  income,  while  the \ntrees  will  increasingly  provide  local  employment  in  wood-related  businesses.  The  Forestry \nDepartment  will  provide  communities  with  technical  support  in  cleaning,  pruning,  thinning,  and \ninformation on when to harvest and where to find markets. This relationship forms the basis for \nparticipatory management plans for existing natural forests and established plantations. \n \n20. \nInadequate  community  management  of  the  common  lands  leads  to  meager  forage \navailability, diminished animal health, and reduced livestock productivity. Deferred and rotational \ngrazing  systems  offer  simple  management  methods.  Controlled  grazing  on  200  to  300  hectare \n(ha)  plots  managed  as  part  of  a  village  development  plan  encourages  natural  regeneration  of \nnatural grasses and forbs. In appropriate areas, controlled grazing will include water harvesting \nthrough  contour  trenches,  contour  ditches,  check  dams,9  and  stock-water  ponds.  A  training \nneeds  assessment  of  community  and  institutional  requirements  for  carrying  out  these  activities \nwill be conducted early in project implementation utilizing capabilities present within NWFP. \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Community Infrastructure \n\nInfrastructure investments will remove critical infrastructure obstacles to service delivery \n21. \nand productivity through new construction and improvement of drinking water supply, small-scale \nirrigation and water storage structures, and link and access roads. Appendix 4 lists infrastructure \nselection  criteria,  and  a  more  detailed  description  of \nin \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n\nthe  component \n\nis  available \n\n                                                 \n9  A check dam is a small dam constructed across a drainage channel to lower the speed of concentrated flows and \n\nthereby facilitate infiltration to groundwater. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\na. \n\nWater Resource Assessment and Management Plan \n\n22.  Water  resources  and  their  development  and  sustainable  management  are  integral  to \nimproving  the  well-being  of  FATA  residents.  Due  to  their  importance  and  the  substantial  role \nplayed  by  water-related  interventions,  this  subcomponent  will  include  a  ground-  and  surface-\nwater assessment and development of a management plan as part of the first year activities. The \nwater  assessment  and  management  plan  will  evaluate  the  current  status  of  surface-  and \ngroundwater  in  the  three  project  agencies  to  determine  safe  yields  for  groundwater  and \nexploitable  surface  runoff  to  identify  areas  for  wells  and  small  water  developments.  The \nassessment will identify suitable sites for larger interventions such as ponds and small storages, \nflood  control  works,  and  gravity  (diversion  or  small  storage)  irrigation  systems.  It  will  provide \ntechnical expertise and work with relevant line agencies to develop a surface- and groundwater \nmonitoring system along with a development and management framework and plan.  \n\nb. \n\nDrinking Water Supply Schemes \n\nProvision of drinking water supplies is a priority intervention throughout the project area. \n23. \nMost villages located in the foothills will benefit from spring-fed gravity schemes; plains areas will \nlargely  rely  on  pumped  schemes  based  on  dug  wells,  hand  pumps,  and  a  limited  number  of \ntubewells  where  groundwater  extraction  is  sustainable.  Field  surveys  in  all  areas  show  that \nwomen  and  older  female  children  typically  spend  several  hours  every  day  carrying  water  from \nfar-off  springs  or  streams,  which  are  usually  open  to  contamination.  The  Project  will  construct \naround  212  spring-fed, gravity-flow  systems,  each  providing  an  average  of  60  liters  per  capita. \nThis effort will ensure a supply of clean drinking water through a system of community tanks or \nstand  posts  and  help  alleviate  the  severe  problems  faced  by  the  relatively  remote  settlements. \nAll  schemes  will  be  identified  through  a  participatory  process  with  villagers  required  to  provide \nunskilled  labor,  implementation  management,  and  O&M  after  completion.  The  actual  size  and \nnumber of various community-managed schemes will be determined in consultation with village \norganizations.  \n \n24. \nAround 624 dug-well schemes are proposed, particularly in areas where the groundwater \ntable  is  high  and  stable.  These  typically  are  multipurpose  drinking  water  and  irrigation  water \nsources.  An  average  dug  well  provides  for  the  drinking  water  needs  of  10  to  20  households. \nUsers/farmers are expected to provide up to 50% of the cost of such schemes through in-kind \ncontributions.  Tubewell-based  schemes  for  drinking  water  (as  well  as  irrigation)  are  feasible \nwhere  the  potential  for  springs  or  shallow  groundwater  development  is  generally  low.  The \nsituation  is  particularly  severe  in  parts  of  Khyber  and  Mohmand  agencies.  Because  of  their \ncomplexity,  private contractors will carry out tubewell boring, testing, and development, as well \nas  the  construction  of  overhead  reservoirs.  The  village  organization  will  be  responsible  for \ninstallation  of  the  distribution  systems  as  well  as  O&M  after  completion.  Communities\u2019 \ncommitment  to  meet  the  energy  cost  of  operating  schemes  will  be  a  condition  for  eligibility.  In \nareas without access to electricity, diesel generators will be supplied. About 31 tubewell-based \nwater supply systems will be provided where groundwater is sustainable for their supply.  \n \nHand  pumps  typically  serve  the  needs  of  a  section  of  a  village,  as  discharges  are \n25. \ngenerally small. Depending on the village size and hand-pump capacity, more than one scheme \nmay  be  required.  The  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  Department  will  provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  during  implementation  as  well  as  O&M  training  to  selected  villagers. \nStandards already established under the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-funded rural \nwater supply and sanitation projects in NWFP will be followed. The relatively simple construction \nwill  allow  significant  involvement  of  the  local  communities  who  will  provide  labor  and  local \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmaterials,  and  ensure  maintenance  and  repair  after  completion.  Around  135  hand-pump \nschemes are envisioned under the Project.  \n\n26. \nThe  Project  includes  financing  of  a  proposed  Shalman  to  Landi  Kotal  water  supply \nscheme,  which  will  serve  the  population  of  Landi  Kotal  town  and  other  communities  along  the \nroute  of  the  pipeline  in Khyber  agency,  including  Afghan  refugees.  The  scheme  is  expected  to \nserve approximately 78,000 people by 2030. A summary description of the scheme is available \nin  Appendix  5  and  the  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Financing  will  be  contingent  on \nsuccessful  compliance  with  the  conditions  set  forth  in  Appendix  5  and  the  relevant  loan \nassurances. \n \n\nc. \n\nSmall Irrigation Systems \n\n27. \nIrrigation  schemes  in  the  project  area  operate  at  low  efficiencies  or  are  in  disrepair. \nSurface  and  flood  irrigation  schemes  have  suffered  badly  due  to  excessive  silting  or  damage. \nDiversion works with protection bunds along the banks of the local watercourses have collapsed \nor  been  washed  away  by  floods.  Repairing  systems  that  are  damaged  or  have  incurred \nexcessive  wear  and  tear  is  largely  beyond  the  capacity  of  local  farmers.  Existing  schemes \nurgently  need  rehabilitation.  The  Project  will  improve  about  72  existing  and  construct  about  36 \nnew  irrigation  structures,  through  cost-sharing  arrangements  with  local  communities,  combined \nwith farmers\u2019 training in construction techniques as well as O&M. Commitment to meeting O&M \nwill be a condition for eligibility of subproject selection. Rainwater harvesting through check dams \nwill  be  an  important  focus  as  the  bulk  of  the  surface  rainfall  runoff  is  untapped  due  to  limited \nknowledge  or  low  capacity  of  local  villagers.  Approximately  130  check  dams  are  proposed. \nWhere feasible, the Project plans to construct about 80 small ponds and about 12 delayed action \ndams of a maximum height of 6 meters (m) to create storage for irrigation, improve groundwater \nrecharge, as well as ensure water supplies for livestock and other nondrinking needs of the local \ncommunities.  \n \n28. \nIn  some  areas  on  gravity  irrigation  schemes,  water  losses  due  to  seepage,  subsurface \npercolation,  and  evaporation  are  high.  Conveyance  efficiencies  are  also  low  because  of  poor \nchannel alignment and inadequate slopes of field-level structures. Where appropriate the lining \nof  the  channels  and  other  associated  hydraulic  structures  will  be  supported  to  improve \nconveyance  efficiencies.  Several  streams  have  perennial  flow  that  will  be  harnessed  through \nprovision of pumping systems or new and improved diversion structures, subject to technical and \nfinancial  feasibility.  Flood  diversion  schemes  will  increase  farmers\u2019  ability  to  protect  against \nexcessive  runoff,  improve  water  management,  and  irrigate  a  larger  command  area  through \nefficient  on-farm  water  management  by  the  respective  communities.  The  Project  will  focus  on \nsoil conservation by constructing protection bunds along the affected land and reclaiming eroded \nland.  Accordingly,  the  Project  will  finance  the  construction  of  schemes  with  sufficient \ngroundwater potential, and a large number of resident beneficiaries. \n \n\nd. \n\nRoad Construction and Improvement \n\nA  very  limited  program  of  works  on  arterial  roads  will  address  problems  of  accessibility \n29. \nbetween  adjacent  valleys  and  villages,  which  affect  significant  population  clusters.  Of  the  total \nroad  network,  nearly  40%  are  shingled  tracks  while  the  rest  are  all-weather  blacktop.  The \ncondition  of  the  smaller  rural  roads  linking  villages  to  arterial  roads  is  generally  poor  and \nresources  for  their  maintenance  and  repair  inadequate.  The  subcomponent  will  benefit  the \nrelatively remote clusters of villages that are currently inaccessible, through the construction of \nlow-cost link roads. This requires community participation in identification of alignment, provision \nof  land,  community  supervision  during  construction,  and  assured  maintenance  and  repair  after \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\ncompletion.  Training  will  be  provided  to  villagers  and  village  organizations  on  maintenance, \nrepair, and management of roads. The second category of road work will include improving and \nupgrading existing roads that have fallen into disrepair or are in need of priority works. A total of \n120 kilometers (km) of new low-cost link roads and 72 km of improvement/upgrading works are \nproposed.  All  roads  identified  for  project  support  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  agreed \nselection criteria (Appendix 4).    \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Project Planning, Management, and Support \n\n30. \nProject  planning,  management,  and  other  support  services  will  be  provided  to  facilitate \ntimely implementation, including (i) engaging consultants and other specialist contract services; \n(ii) procuring vehicles and equipment; and (iii) establishing accounting, monitoring, and reporting \nsystems. A key feature will be the establishment of a management information system (MIS) for \nregular  monitoring  of  physical  and  financial  progress  and  development  impacts  of  the  project. \nThe  MIS  will  link  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs) \nwith the project executing and implementing agencies.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nAdvisory Technical Assistance \n\nSeparate capacity-building advisory TA10 is currently being provided to line departments11 \n31. \nworking  in  FATA  responsible  for  project  implementation.  This  includes  agency-based  staff  and \ntheir  provincial  head  offices.  Key  focus  areas  of  the  TA  include  (i)  strengthening  project \nmanagement,  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (ii)  strengthening  financial  management \nsystems  and  procedures  covering  planning,  budgeting,  cash-flow  management,  and  systems \nand procedures to monitor financial and implementation performance; (iii) enhancing information, \ncommunication,  and  technology  systems;  and  (iv)  familiarizing  the  target  group  with  ADB \npolicies,  procedures,  and  guidelines.  The  TA  will  also  undertake  community-based \norganizational  strengthening  and  prepare  detailed  implementation  manuals.  Training  programs \ncovering  these  focus  areas  will  be  completed  before  substantive  activities  of  the  Project \ncommence. \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n32. \nThe Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (as amended) is the core legislation used in Pakistan \nfor acquiring private lands for a public purpose. But this act, as with most other laws of Pakistan, \ndoes not apply to FATA. Local needs for land acquisition are addressed through the system of \nland  rights  and  distribution.  In  the  absence  of  a  formal  legal  policy  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  a  project-specific  set  of  resettlement  principles  consistent  with  ADB  policy \nrequirements has been adopted for the Project. The level of land acquisition required is expected \nto  vary  from  significant  to  nonsignificant  depending  on  individual  project  interventions.  A \nsummary  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  provided  in  Appendix  6  and  the  resettlement \nframework is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003.

The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $11.4 million, or \nabout  19%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $49  million  equivalent,  or \nabout 81% of the total cost. The local currency costs include an estimated $1.8 million equivalent \nfor  taxes  and  duties  to  be  paid  by  the  Government.  The  project  cost  estimate  summarized  in \nTable 1 and Appendix 7 should be regarded as indicative only.

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan will \nfinance  70%  of  the  total  project  cost:  $11.4  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  (100%)  and \n$30.6  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  (70%).  The  Government  will  provide  $15.4 \nmillion  equivalent,  or  25%  of  the  project  cost,  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompensation of $2.7 million. The beneficiaries will contribute $3.0 million equivalent, or 5% of \nthe project cost through their labor inputs.12 The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12 The Project will pay unskilled laborers 60% of the cash value of labor inputs. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan a \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n30.6 \n15.4 \n3.0 \n49.0 \n\nTotal \nCost \n42.0 \n15.4 \n3.0 \n60.4 \n\nSource \n\nPercent \n\nAsian Development Bank \n11.4 \nGovernmentb \n0 \n0 \nBeneficiaries \n \n11.4 \nTotal \na The allocation of loan proceeds in the loan agreement are presented in the special drawing rights \n(SDR)  equivalent  of  US  dollars,  with  reference  only  to  total  expenditure  in  accordance  with  the \nADB Board paper: ADB. 2005.

The  Secretary \nwill  appoint  a  staff  person  to  manage  the  EA\u2019s  role  in  the  Project.  The  Governor\u2019s  Secretariat \n(FATA),  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA),  is  responsible  for  day-to-day  coordination  of  project \nactivities among the line departments and for supervision of the overall project. \n \n \n \n36. \nThe  Project  will  follow  a  decentralized  implementation  arrangement  to  facilitate \nparticipation  of  communities.  Project  management  will  be  at  two  levels:  (i)  at  Peshawar \ninterfacing with the Governor's Secretariat (FATA), other government agencies, private and civil \nsociety  through  a  PMU;  and  (ii)  at  the  agency  level  through  PIUs  in  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and \nMohmand.  Planning  and  operational  project  management  will  be  at  the  agency  level,  where \nactivities  will  be  identified,  endorsed,  and  implemented  through  government  line  departments, \noutsourced consultants, and contracted experts. The Peshawar-based PMU headed by a project \ndirector, will (i) coordinate project-related issues with the EA, IA, agencies, and private and civil \nsociety;  (ii)  consolidate  work  plans  prepared  by  the  PIUs  and  facilitate  approval  by  the  project \nsteering  committee  (PSC);  (iii)  award  contracts  exceeding  the  amount  equivalent  to  $100,000; \n(iv)  recruit  consultants;  (v)  perform  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (vi)  supervise  consultants  and \ncontractors; and (vii) manage project finances.  \n \nA  PIU  will  be  established  in  each  of  the  three  agencies,  headed  by  a  project  manager. \n37. \nEach PIU will (i) coordinate project operational issues with the line departments in the respective \nagency;  (ii)  prepare  work  plans  under  the  project,  obtain  endorsement  of  work  plans  by  the  \nagency project board (APB) and implement the same; (iii) award contracts up to the equivalent of \n$100,000; (iv) assist the PMU in supervision of consultants and contractors; (v) assist the PMU \nin monitoring and evaluation project activities; and (vi) manage finances related to the project in \nthe respective agency. The project managers will report to the project director. \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nAll project staff, including the project director and three project managers, will be hired on \n38. \na  contract  basis  through  an  open  and  competitive  process.  The  qualifications,  experience, \nexpertise  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  project  director  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The \nPMU  in  Peshawar  will  use  either  existing  government  facilities  or  rent  offices  during  project \nimplementation.  The  Project  will  construct  offices  for  each  PIU.13  In  addition,  women\u2019s  hostels \nwill  be  constructed  in  Bajaur  and  Mohmand  agencies.  For  security  reasons,  both  office  and \nhostel facilities will be constructed inside the political agent compounds on land provided by the \npolitical  agency.  Until  completion  of  construction,  the  agencies  will  provide  temporary  working \nand sleeping accommodation for both staff and consultants. \n \n \n\nSteering Committee \n\nc.  \n\n \n\nA  PSC  will  be  established  to  (i)  provide  policy  guidance  and  interpretations  in \n39. \nimplementation  of  the  project;  (ii)  approve  the  consolidated  annual  work  plans  for  the  three \nagencies; (iii) review on semiannual basis, the progress of the project including performance of \nthe project director and other PMU staff; (iv) coordinate and direct activities of line departments \nunder the project; and (v) recommend issues for consideration of the project review board (PRB). \nThe  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary,  Governor\u2019s  Secretariat  (FATA)  and  include  as \nmembers  (i)  a  representative  of  the  EA;  (ii)  representatives  of  the  line  departments;  (iii)  the \npolitical agents;14 and (iv) the project director will serve as the member/secretary. The PSC shall \nmeet as required but not less than four times a year. \n \n \n\nReview Board \n\nd. \n\n \n\nA  PRB  will  be  established  to  resolve  issues  of  strategic  importance  which  may  affect \n40. \nsmooth  implementation  of  the  project,  take  related  policy  decisions  and  review  the  project \nprogress annually. The PRB will be chaired by the Governor, NWFP with the secretary of the EA \nas its deputy chair.  Other members of the PRB will include: (i) the chief secretary, NWFP; (ii) the \nadditional  chief  secretary,  NWFP;  (iii)  the  secretary,  Governor\u2019s  Secretariat  (FATA)  who  shall \nalso  serve  as  the  secretary  to  the  PRB;  (iv)  a  representative  of  the  Economic  Affairs  Division; \nand (v) the project director. The PRB shall meet as required but not less than twice a year. \n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nAgency Project Boards \n\n41. \nAn APB in each agency will established to review and endorse annual work plans within \nthe  agency.  These  plans  will  be  consistent  with  explicit  project  selection  criteria.  Plan \ndevelopment  and  presentation  is  the  responsibility  of  the  project  manager.  The  APB  will  be \nchaired by the political agent of the respective agency, with the project manager serving as the \nmember/secretary. Other members will include (i) representatives of the line departments at the \nagency level; (ii) two tribal elders; and (iii) two agency councilors. The APB will meet as required. \nThis arrangement is consistent with a fully decentralized local government structure, anticipated \nfor the future, at which time an elected official will supersede the political agent.   \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent Implementation  \n\n42. \nNo  large-scale,  community-based  development  activity  is  currently  being  undertaken  in \nthe project area. The extent to  which communities and their leadership, as well as the political \nadministration, will adapt to the Project is unknown. A strong demonstration effect through early, \n                                                 \n13  In Mohmand Agency, the PIU is expected to be housed in an existing building, which will be improved by adding an \nadditional story. In addition, water will be provided on a daily basis by tanker as no other method of regular water \ndelivery is available.  \n\n14 Political agent refers to the head of an agency. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\npositive  action  is  vital  for  gaining  the  confidence  of  the  communities,  as  well  as  the  positive \ncooperation  of  the  line  department  staff.  PIU  social  organizing  staff  will  seek  out  areas  most \namenable  to  cooperation  with  the  Project  by  using  group  consultations,  discussions  with  local \nleaders,  and  participatory  rural  appraisal  techniques  to  identify  priority  needs  such  as  drinking \nwater supply schemes; small link roads; rehabilitation and improvement of small-scale irrigation \nsystems;  and  agricultural,  livestock,  and  forestry  programs  appropriate  to  the  season.  These \ninterventions will be identified with the assistance of line departments and technical contract staff \ntrained in group-based extension techniques. Within the first 6 months of implementation, each \nPIU  will  provide  initial  work  plans,  specifying  watershed  areas  and  proposed  priority  initial \nsubprojects. \n \n43. \nAlthough  the  process  of  planning  and  implementation  will  require  regular  consultation \nwith  communities  over  time,  some  watershed  areas  have  a  high  probability  of  accepting  and \nworking  with  the  Project.  Appendix  8  lists  proposed  watershed  selection  criteria.  Two  such \nwatersheds  from  each  agency  will  be  identified  by  consensus  among  the  political  agent,  line \ndepartments, and agency project manager as pilot areas for the first year of implementation, with \nearly attention given to easily identifiable infrastructure and agricultural interventions. Based on \nthe experience of working within six watershed areas in the first year, comprising approximately \n60 villages or community groups, an additional 12 watersheds and 120 villages/communities per \nyear will be selected for planning and implementing various activities during the second and third \nyears respectively. Community members and project staff will track requests for assistance and \nensure  effective  distribution  of  related  activities  within  watersheds  through  the  use  of  a \ngeographic information system-based georeferenced database. Appendix 9 describes subproject \ndevelopment  and  approval  procedures.  Detailed  implementation  arrangements  are  available  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years (2006 to 11). The implementation schedule \n44. \nis in Appendix 10. First year activities include (i) establishing the project accounts and reporting \nlinks; (ii) contracting and implementing a baseline socioeconomic survey to establish indicators \nfor  assessing  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  poverty  in  participating  communities;  (iii)  contracting  and \nimplementing  a  water  resource  assessment  study;  (iv)  contracting  and  commencing  an \nindependent  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  program;  (v)  establishing  three  PIUs,  and \ndeveloping annual work plans and staffing schedules for each agency for the first year of project \nimplementation;  (vi)  identifying  two  watersheds  in  each  agency  for  integrated  planning  and \ncommencement of priority project activities in some 60 poor communities in those watersheds; \n(vii) establishing a geographic information system database system;15 (viii) recruiting consultants \nand project staff; (ix) establishing a project monitoring and evaluation system; and (x) procuring \nrequisite equipment and vehicles.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n45. \nProcurement  of  vehicles,  machinery,  office  equipment,  and  special  equipment  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  under  the \nproposed  Shalman  water  supply  scheme  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Because  of  the  small  to  medium  size  of  the  remaining  civil \nworks  and  their  scattered  nature,  they  will  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  or  other  arrangements  with  private  contractors  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  local \ncontractors will be required to attend a training course covering ADB standards, procedures, and \n\n                                                 \n15  Digitized data are available at the Department of Forestry. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nenvironmental requirements; the training will be updated annually. A list of procurement activities \nis provided in Appendix 11. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n46. \nThe Project will require a total of 147 person-months of consulting services comprising 21 \nperson-months of international and 126 person-months of domestic specialized services in long- \nand  short-term  appointments  through  a  consulting  firm  and  individual  consultants.  In  addition, \nspecialized service contracts will be awarded for several project activities including (i) a baseline \nsurvey;  (ii)  community  mobilization  activities  and  a  public  information  campaign;  (iii)  periodic \nindependent audits of project performance; (iv) the surface- and groundwater assessment study; \nand  (v)  establishment  and  implementation  of  the  project  management  information  system.  The \nGovernment will engage consulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The \nquality-and  cost-based  selection  procedures  will  be  used  in  recruiting  the  consultants.  A \nsummary  of  consulting  services  is  provided  in  Appendix  12  and  detailed  terms  of  reference  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \n47. \nand Executing Agency. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nTo expedite disbursement and ensure timely execution of the Project, immediately after \n48. \nloan effectiveness an imprest account for the EA and four second-generation imprest accounts \nfor  the  PMU  and  each  PIU  will  be  opened  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.  Fund  flow \narrangements  are  further  described  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  opening  of  the  imprest \naccounts will be subject to the appointment of qualified accounting staff and the establishment of \naccounting  systems  and  internal  controls  acceptable  to  ADB  by  the  PMU  and  the  three  PIUs. \nThe imprest account will have a ceiling equivalent to an estimated 6-month expenditure or 10% \nof the loan amount, whichever is less. The second-generation imprest account of the PMU will \nhave a ceiling of $150,000 and those of the PIUs will have a ceiling of $100,000. All accounts will \nbe  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditure and liquidate advances to the imprest \naccount.  The  limit  for  each  individual  payment  on  a  statement  of  expenditure  will  not  exceed \n$50,000. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nAfter consultation with line departments and formal endorsement by the APBs, the PIUs \nwill  forward  annual  work  plans  to  the  PMU  for  onward  submission  and  approval  by  the  PSC. \nWork plans will detail activities scheduled for the forthcoming year, including timing, material and \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nfinancial  inputs  needed,  and  outputs  expected.  The  PIUs  will  provide  the  PMU  with  brief \nquarterly progress reports detailing the physical and financial progress of activities against work-\nplan  targets.  The  PIUs  will  also  adopt  a  transparent  process,  acceptable  to  ADB,  for \ndisseminating  information  on  subproject  expenditure.  The  project  director  will  provide  the \nGovernment and ADB with consolidated quarterly progress reports and comprehensive year-end \nannual reports which will contain information that will feed into the project MIS and by extension, \nthe project performance management system (PPMS). The project director will also provide on a \nsemi-annual basis, a summary of findings of the independent performance reviews and actions \nproposed  in  response  to  these  findings.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  a  project \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB.  \n \n50. \nThe  PMU  and  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  funds \nprovided  to  the  Project  in  accordance  with  international  accounting  standards.  An  independent \nexternal auditor acceptable to ADB will audit the accounts annually. The imprest accounts and \nstatement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  of  the  Project\u2019s \naccount  and  financial  statements.  The  audited  project  accounts  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  not \nlater than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nTo  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  target \n51. \ngroups  receive  the  intended  benefits,  a  participatory  PPMS,  modeled  on  the  project  MIS  and \nconsistent with ADB's monitoring system, will be used by the PMU and PIUs. An initial survey to \nestablish  the  overall  monitoring  system  will  be  conducted  during  the  initial  6  months  of  the \nProject. The emphasis will be on impact monitoring and the key indicators will be (i) incorporated \ninto the Project\u2019s regular monitoring process; (ii) reassessed at each comprehensive review and \nat project completion; (iii) used to compare with district indicators and programs in neighboring \nNWFP; and (iv) used to measure the Project\u2019s contribution to achievement of the Medium Term \nDevelopment Framework targets, the Millennium Development Goals, and other relevant targets. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  reviews  of  the  project.  Initial  reviews  will  (i)  determine \n52. \nwhether  all  the  proposed  implementation  arrangements  and  schedules  are  appropriate,  (ii) \nassess  the  level  of  cooperation  from  agency  political  administrations  in  meeting  project \nobjectives,  (iii)  review  progress  on  infrastructure  activities,  (iv)  review  the  integrated  resource \ndevelopment activities in terms of their distribution and adoption by beneficiaries, and (v) assess \nprogress of participation by women. A midterm review will be jointly undertaken by ADB and the \nGovernment  at  the  end  of  30  months  to  assess  physical  and  financial  progress  of  the  Project, \nimplementation  procedures,  procurement  performance,  monitoring  activities,  PMU/PIU \neffectiveness, and performance of consultants.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n53. \nThe  Project  will  result  in  several  quantifiable  and  nonquantifiable  effects.  Quantifiable \nbenefits  include  increased  crop,  livestock,  and  forest  production,  as  well  as  time  savings  in \nhousehold  water  supply  provision,  and  time  and  cartage  cost  savings  from  road  transport. \nNonquantified  benefits  include  improved  environmental  conditions;  better  nutrition  and  food \nsecurity;  and  improved  access  to  medical,  educational,  and  other  services  outside  of  the  rural \ncommunities targeted by the Project.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses \n\n54. \nFinancial and economic analyses were carried out for the Project as a whole and for six \nsubcomponents. The financial analysis was based on farm budgets to assess the impact of the \nProject on farm productivity and returns to the farmers. Six model budgets were prepared. The \noverall estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is about 19.1%. Among \nthe natural resource management subcomponents, the estimated EIRR for the farming systems \nand  crop  production  subcomponent  is  37.3%  followed  by  17.8%  for  the  livestock  and  fodder \nproduction component. The EIRR for community forestry and range management is estimated as \n17.5%.  Among  the  community  infrastructure  interventions,  the  estimated  EIRR  for  community \ndrinking  water  supply  schemes  is  31.0%,  rural  link  roads  16.5%,  and  irrigation  works  14.6%. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out for all of the subprojects to examine a range of risks including \nadverse  changes  in  investment  cost,  output  prices,  yields,  implementation  completion,  and \nproject life. Overall, the results are fairly robust. The methodology and details of the financial and \neconomic analyses are provided in Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n55. \nFor most of the irrigation schemes and drinking water supply schemes the responsibility \nfor O&M will lie with the beneficiary households. For the drinking water schemes, O&M costs can \nbe  expected  to  be  about  10%  of  the  value  of  the  annual  household  benefit.  For  irrigation \nschemes,  average  O&M  costs  will  be  about  12.5%  of  the  financial  benefits.  In  both  cases, \nbeneficiary  communities  should  have  sufficient  incentives  to  ensure  their  schemes  continue  to \nfunction well. \n \nC. \n\nHousehold and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\n56. \nProject  benefits  will  accrue  initially  to  those  willing  to  participate  in  community \norganizations.  Benefits  from  training  programs  or  infrastructure  and  improved  farming  and \nlivestock  rearing  practices,  and  additional  income  through  rehabilitation  of  the  ecosystem  will \naccrue generally to community members. Access to organizations and participation within them \nby  all  interested  individuals  will  be  a  unifying  theme  for  community  mobilization.  Organizations \nwill  be  established  based  on  socially  acceptable  norms,  with  men  and  women\u2019s  groups \n(Appendix 14) separately addressing issues of mutual interest in a culturally appropriate manner. \nAs  a  result  of  the  Project,  beneficiaries  will  obtain  access  to  opportunities  for  improving  their \nlivelihoods, broaden networks of knowledge and contacts with service providers, and learn more \nproductive farming techniques with all the community sharing access to improved infrastructure. \nThe Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 15.  \n \n57. \nThe  farming  system  and  crop  management  subcomponent  will  increase  production  for \nabout 37,500 beneficiary households, or 337,500 people (assuming an average holding of 1.4 ha \nper  household  and  an  average  household  size  of  9).  After  a  full  phasing  in  of  benefits,  annual \nincremental farm income should rise by about PRs6,000 per household. Most benefits will go to \nlandholders\u2015an  estimated  57%  of  whom  are  poor.  Incremental  labor  days  for  crop  production \nare  estimated  at  585,000  annually  and  at  least  a  portion  of  this  will  go  to  hired  labor.  The \nlivestock  and  fodder  management  subcomponent  will  affect  414,000  people  in  the  targeted \nhouseholds. Through increased milk and live weight, annual incremental household income can \nbe  expected  to  be  PRs1,600.  The  poor  will  have  access  to  these  benefits,  though  they  will \nprobably concentrate on smaller animals. \n \n58. \nIrrigation development should benefit 4,750 households (42,750 people). Per household \nincremental income will be about PRs54,900 per household. The poor\u2019s share will be similar to \nthat noted in the farming system subcomponent. Increased incremental labor days are expected \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nto be 919,500 days per year\u2014some of which will increase employment for hired labor. Drinking \nwater  supply  schemes  should  affect  about  160,000  people.  The  time  saving  and  decreased \nmedical  cost  benefits  are  valued  at  about  PRs8,400  per  household  per  year.  The  road  and \nforestry  subcomponents  will  benefit  the  communities  at  large,  including  the  poor.  The  forestry \nprogram will increase employment by an average of 123,500 person-days per year. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nThe  natural  environment  of  the  project  area  has  undergone  severe  degradation  due  to \n59. \nintensified  use  of  the  range,  forest  products,  and  water  resources.  Existing  institutional \narrangements  are  incapable  of  reversing  this  process  of  degradation.  The  Project  aims  to \nintroduce  an  integrated  watershed  management  approach  combining  agriculture,  irrigation, \nrange, and forestry interventions within defined watershed areas. This approach will help reduce \npressure  on  the  currently  degraded  resource  base,  increase  water  availability  in  watershed \nareas,  and  control  the  erosion  damage  resulting  from  runoff.  Awareness  of  the  environmental \nbenefits from integrated planning and management of watersheds will be disseminated through \ncommunity  organizations,  training  for  community  leaders,  and  capacity  building  for  line \ndepartment  staff.  Current  infrastructure  construction  practices,  especially  for  roads,  do  not \nconsider  the  environmental  damages  caused  by  such  construction.  However  the  Project  will \nintroduce  planning,  design,  and  construction  practices  with  suitable  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures  based  on  appropriate  environmental  assessment  studies  (as  described  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  framework  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I). \nThe  awareness,  and  knowledge  and  technology  transfer  from  undertaking  environmentally \nsound  infrastructure  construction  will  set  a  valuable  precedent  among  communities  and  line \ndepartments to guide future practice. Overall, the Project is expected to have a positive impact \non the environment. The summary initial environmental examination report is in Supplementary \nAppendix J, and initial environmental examination in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nE. \n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\n60. \nA defining feature of FATA is the continuing importance of tribal elders and leaders, the \nmaliks. Operating without their agreement, support, and protection is difficult, if not impossible. \nPolitical agents play a key role in providing introductions to local leaders, and thereby ensuring \naccess, particularly to formerly inaccessible areas. The maliks either own or control a large part \nof  the  economic  resources  and  government  investments  in  their  areas.  In  such  circumstances, \nsignificant  portions  of  the  local  population  are excluded  from  decision-making  or  sharing  in  the \nbenefits  of  development.  Excluding  the  better-off  members  of  communities  from  receiving \nbenefits is neither possible, nor desirable, but opportunities must be distributed more equitably. \nWithin  the  existing  \u201cmaliki\u201d  system,  the  poorer  residents  of communities  and  especially  women \ndo not normally get a chance to improve their material well-being.  \n \n61. \nAchieving  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  project  benefits  requires  that  agency  line \ndepartments  diligently  adhere  to  a  process  of  regular  consultation  with  beneficiaries,  with  the \nconsent  and  support  of  the  political  agents  and  the  local  jirgas  (a  council  of  tribal  elders). \nConsistent application of such a process will reinforce the message of community participation. If \naccomplished from the earliest stage as part of the project design, this need not be a source of \nconflict or misunderstanding within tribal groups. Community facilitation staff will be responsible \nfor  establishing  dialogue  with  stakeholders,  and  for  continued  monitoring  of  community \ninvolvement  during  implementation.  The  most  effective  technique  for  guaranteeing  wide \ndissemination of benefits is to maintain transparent processes for activity selection, expenditure \nreporting, and O&M of the various subprojects. \n   \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nThe quality of project management and administration, and the ability of the Governor\u2019s \n62. \nSecretariat  (FATA)  to  operate  smoothly  in  FATA,  depend  on  strengthening  the  Secretariat  and \nagency  capacities  to  deal  with  large  and  complex  development  programs.  The  Project  will \nprovide  assistance  in  strengthening  implementation  and  financial  management  capabilities  of \nthese agencies through establishment of the PMU and three PIUs. A capacity-building TA (para. \n31)  is  preparing  the  Governor\u2019s  Secretariat  and  agency  line  departments  to  undertake  the \nProject. \n \nAlthough  the  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  indicates  a  fair  degree  of  robustness, \n63. \nachieving the expected project impacts involves some risks. One such risk is whether beneficiary \ncommunities will provide O&M for small infrastructure projects like drinking water schemes and \nirrigation  systems,  as  well  as  community  rangelands  and  forests.  In  the  past,  government-\nfinanced schemes have not attracted community participation in O&M,  and the requirement for \nbeneficiaries  to  own  and  manage  project  benefits  will  be  novel.  The  Project  is  designed  to \nminimize  this  risk  by  emphasizing  community  mobilization  during  selection,  construction,  and \nO&M.  This  responsibility  will  be  clearly  explained,  and  community  consensus  will  be  obtained \nprior  to  the  commencement  of  activities,  since  communities  are  more  likely  to  collaborate  on \nO&M  of  schemes  that  they  identify,  and  that  address  their  expressed  needs.  With  subprojects \nthat  are  solely  the  responsibility  of  the  direct  beneficiaries  (i.e.,  drinking  water  tubewells  or \nshallow dug wells, small irrigation schemes, and ponds), the Project will also ease the burden on \nbeneficiaries of undertaking full O&M responsibility from the outset, by initially supporting O&M \non a declining percentage basis, with the beneficiaries assuming the full cost by year 5. These \narrangements  are  more  explicitly  explained  in  Appendix  16.  Line  departments  will  undertake \nO&M  for  larger  scale  infrastructure.  Additionally,  the  Project  includes  institutional  strengthening \nof extension line agencies as well as training of community members. \n  \n64. \nThe  Project  will  rely  on  contractors  to  do  much  of  the  construction  work  for  roads, \nirrigation,  and  water  supply.  Since  outside  contractors  can  receive  active  opposition  from \ncommunities,  agencies  typically  use  predetermined  contractors  for  small-scale  infrastructure. \nWhile they have access to the area, their capabilities are not strong; even the best of such pre-\nselected contractors lack equipment and appropriate technical skills. To reduce the risk of poor \nquality construction, the Project will adopt a process of open, competitive tendering. Contractors \nfrom  outside  the  project  area  will  be  encouraged  to  make  arrangements  to  use  local \nsubcontractors where and as appropriate both to gain entry in areas and find local labor. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n65. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nfrom \n\nits  budget \n\nThe  Government  will  allocate  and  make  available,  in  a  timely  manner,  requisite \ncounterpart \nthe  smooth \nfunds \nimplementation of the Project.  \nThe  Government  will  establish,  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  project \nsteering  committee  and  the  project  review  board,  and  within  3  months  of \neffectiveness,  an  agency  project  board  in  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand \nagencies.  \n\nfiscal  year \n\nfor  each \n\nfor \n\n(iii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  (i)  establish  three \nagency-based, fully staffed, and operational PIUs; (ii) make the PMU fully staffed \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nand  operational;  and  (iii)  cause  the  PMU  and  the  PIUs  to  establish  their \naccounting and financial management systems, acceptable to ADB.  \n\n(iv)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMU  will  undertake  a  community \n\nmobilization facilitation process, acceptable to ADB. \n\n(v)  Within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  the  PMU  to \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nestablish participatory PPMS, acceptable to ADB, for monitoring project impact. \nThe Government will provide adequate security necessary for the safe mobility of \npersons  carrying  out \ntimely  and  uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project. \nTo  ensure  maximum  participation  from  all  segments,  the  Government  shall \nadvertise  in  at  least  two  dailies  with  nationwide  coverage,  all  local  contracts  for \ngoods and services. \n\nthe  Project \n\nto  ensure \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\nthat \n\nimplement  community \n\n(viii)  To  ensure  continuity,  efficiency,  and  smooth  implementation  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  agrees \nrequisite  Government  staff  with  qualifications, \nexperience and expertise, acceptable to ADB will be seconded to the Project for, \nat least, a term of 3 years.  \nThe  Government  will  select  eligible  watersheds  in  accordance  with  watershed \nselection  criteria  and  select  and \nin \naccordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and  subproject  intervention \nprocedures agreed with ADB. \nPrior  to  the  completion  of  the  facilities  constructed,  aligned,  improved,  and/or \nrehabilitated  under  the  Project,  the  line  departments  concerned  will  prepare \nmaintenance  plans,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  for  O&M  of  such  facilities.

Approximately 77% of the population and the vast majority of the nation's poor reside \nin  rural  areas.  Most  derive  their  living  from  agriculture  and  off-farm  employment.  Agriculture \nremains  the  single  largest  sector  of  the  economy,  and  is  the  most  important  sector  for \nemployment and income generation. The sector accounts for about 26% of real gross domestic \nproduct and approximately 50% of employment. Growth in the sector has been stagnating over \nthe  past  few  years,  though  it  is  likely  to  remain  the  primary  contributor  for  some  time.  An \nuncertain  policy  environment  (especially  concerning  the  prices  and  marketing  of  major  crops) \ncombined  with  widespread  resource  degradation  has  contributed  to  low  productivity  and \nprofitability.  Other  contributors  to  the  sector's  performance  include  low-quality  inputs,  poor \ninadequate  rural \nquality  of  support  services, \ninfrastructure, and deteriorating natural resource base. \n \n2. \nPoverty  reduction  is  the  key  objective  of  the  Government's  economic  policies.  The \nGovernment's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper1 emphasizes improving productivity and rural \ninfrastructure  as  necessary  conditions  for  achieving  rapid  rural  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction, given that two thirds of the population is rural. The Government's 2003 official poverty \nline  is  estimated  at  PRs748  per  capita  per  month.2  Head-count  ratio  estimates  indicate  that \npoverty  had  been  rising  steadily,  with  some  reduction  noted  in  2003.  Rural  poverty  was \nestimated  as  38.7%,  which  is considerably  higher  than  urban  areas  (22.4%).  The  decrease  in \npoverty for 2003 resulted from macroeconomic stability and near elimination of external account \nvulnerability resulting in a growth rate of 5.1% in 2003 as compared with 3.4% in 2002 and 2.2% \nin  2001.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  based  on  the  following  major \nguidelines:  (i)  accelerating  economic  growth  and  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability;  (ii) \ninvesting  in  human  capital  through  reforms  in  education,  health,  and  population  welfare  by \ninvolving private sector and nongovernment organizations; (iii) developing small- and medium-\nsized enterprises and microfinance in the country to lead to rural development encompassing all \nthe  sectors  of  the  rural  economy  like  agriculture,  irrigation,  livestock  including  fisheries,  and \nelectrification;  and  (iv)  improving  governance  through  reforms  that  facilitate  administrative  and \npolitical devolution, access to justice and information, and fiscal decentralization. \n \n3. \nAgricultural  activity  in  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas  (FATA)  is  opportunistic, \ntaking advantage of streams and underground water, often in very narrow valleys with suitable \nsoil  conditions.  Productive  agricultural  lands  are  web-like,  following  the  valley  floors  as  far  up \ninto the hills as nature will allow, with constructed terraces extending the pattern of agriculture \nfurther to land relying on sporadic rainfall. The few wider valley floors rely on the few tubewells \nor  sporadic  rains  to  produce  grain  crops.  Rangelands  with  some  grass  and  shrubs,  and  oak \nforests in the higher elevations add to the area\u2019s productive potential. A striking feature of the \nproject  area  is  the  difference  in  biophysical  environment  within  the  three  agencies.  High \nmountain  ridges,  elevation  differences  among  valley  floors,  and  positioning  relative  to  major \nweather patterns result in substantial variation among microclimates in the various valleys that \ncomprise  the  three  agencies.  Conditions  range  from  very  arid  with  no  perennial  surface  water \nand  little  natural  vegetation,  as  was  observed  in  Khyber  and  Mohmand,  to  other  areas  with \nseveral  perennial  streams  and  rivers  and  numerous  natural  springs  as  observed  in  Bajaur. \n\n                                                 \n1  Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan. 2003. Pakistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad. \n2  The  Government  uses  an  official  poverty  line  derived  from  the  household  income  and  expenditure  survey,  and \n\nbased on a caloric requirement of 2,150 calories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nConditions  that  vary  between  the  two  extremes  of  near  desert  to  almost  800  millimeters  of \nannual precipitation can be found in all of the agencies.3  \n \n4. \nInfrastructure  has  improved  in  recent  years,  particularly  road  access.  However,  a \nsignificant part of the area still does not have adequate market access by road. Drinking water \nsourced from within the village is available to 60\u201370% of households, but the volume and quality \nare not high. About a third of these households have water within their house compounds either \npiped or by well. Electricity lines exist and more than half the households have formal access to \nelectricity, but many cannot afford it, or will not pay the price; about one quarter of households \nconsider  electricity  as  a  major  source  of  energy.  In  isolated  areas  and  among  poorer  people, \ncow  dung  and  wood  are  the  sources  of  cooking  fuel,  with  50%  (Khyber)  to  70%  (Bajaur)  of \nhouseholds relying on firewood and dung. Irrigation water is much sought after and creates an \nincome  surplus  for  those  with  access  to  it,  but  irrigation  systems  are  not  efficient,  irrigation \npractices are wasteful and the water table continues to subside, either as a result of drought or \nbecause of existing tubewells draining the localized aquifer. \n \nExogenous  and  endogenous  factors  constrain  the  ability  of  households  in  the  FATA  to \n5. \nmake significant improvements in their livelihoods are diverse and interdependent. Exogenous \nfactors include the following:  \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n \n\npoor natural resource base in large segments of FATA; \narea remoteness due to difficult mountainous terrain and topography;  \nFATA  has  provided  a  buffer  zone  between  the  successive  governments  of \nPakistan and Afghanistan over the last five decades, and earlier when the British \nruled the Indian subcontinent; and  \nwar and unsettled conditions have persisted in Afghanistan for the last 25 years. \n\nEndogenous factors include the following: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nlimited area access in some parts of FATA due to security considerations; \nlimited availability of development funds;   \nlimited road network in some parts of FATA; \nlimited  participation  of  civil  society  in  development  activities  because  of  local \nadministration managing tribal affairs mostly through tribal maliks (heads); \nlittle or no involvement of the female population in decision making even though \nthey are significantly involved in agriculture sector related activities; \nineffective centralized decision-making process for planning and implementation \nof  projects  since  these  are  removed  from  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  the \nbeneficiaries; \nlimited or nonexistent monitoring of activities and outputs; and  \n\n(vii) \n(viii)  weak  capacity  of  government  line  agencies  working  in  FATA  for  planning, \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementation, and monitoring development interventions. \n\n \n7. \nA  defining  feature  of  the  tribal  areas  is  the  continuing  importance  of  its  elders  and \nleaders,  the  maliks.  Operating  without  their  agreement,  support,  and  protection  is  difficult  to \nimpossible.  Not  surprisingly,  these  leaders  either  own  or  control  a  large  part  of  the  economic \nresources and government investments in their areas. In such a circumstance, the availability of \n\n                                                 \n3  Although  all  agencies  have  differing  conditions  within  them,  Bajaur  generally  has  the  most  abundant  water \n\nresources, while Mohmand is generally considered the driest. \n\n6. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nbenefits  can  be  an  issue  for  poverty  reduction,  where  selection  criteria  are  not  followed  and \nsignificant  portions  of  the  local  population  are  excluded  from  decision-making  or  benefits. \nExcluding  the  better-off  members  of  communities  from  receiving  benefits  is  not  possible  or \ndesirable, but access to opportunities must be distributed equitably. Within the existing \u201cmaliki\u201d \nsystem,  the  poorest  residents  of  communities  and  especially  women  do  not  normally  get  a \nchance  to  improve  their  material  well-being.  Achieving  broad  distribution  of  project  benefits \nrequires that implementing agencies adhere to regular project monitoring and consultation with \nbeneficiaries  to  reinforce  the  message  of  broad  participation.  Accomplished  from  the  earliest \nstage,  and  as  part  of  the  project  design,  this  need  not  be  a  source  of  conflict  or \nmisunderstanding  within  tribal  groups.  Community  facilitation  staff  are  responsible  for \nestablishing dialogue with stakeholders, and ensuring that participation is not limited. The most \neffective  technique  for  guaranteeing  wide  dissemination  of  benefits  is  to  maintain  transparent \nprocesses for activity selection. \n \n8. \nThe Government recognizes that FATA residents live in dehumanizing poverty, with an \nobsolete  administrative  system  and  highly  stratified  social  and  economic  structures.  FATA \nneeds to be integrated into the national economic mainstream and to benefit from the economic \ngrowth  and  improved  services  the  Government  is  bringing  about  with  the  successful  reform \nprogram launched more than 3 years ago. The Government has devised a four-prong strategy \nto translate this objective into reality: (i) empowering people through the process of devolution \nas  soon  as  the  conditions  are  conducive;  (ii)  reinvigorating  public  institutions  that  are  cost \neffective, efficient, and responsive to the people by restructuring government departments and \nlaw enforcement agencies; (iii) reforming the judiciary by revamping the judicial system; and (iv) \nsupporting  economic  development \nimprove \nsocioeconomic indicators and reduce poverty.  \n \n9. \nThe  project  interventions  focus  on  building  sustainable  changes  in  the  quality  of  life  of \nbeneficiaries  and  are  fully  consistent  with  the  Pakistan  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) poverty reduction strategy, and the ADB country strategy. The Project \nwill improve roads and irrigation infrastructure, and assist communities to gain access to clean \ndrinking water and alternative energy sources. The ability of communities to address their own \nneeds  and  participate  in  planning  for  development  will  increase  through  the  establishment  of \ncommunity-based  organizations.

However where \nthe discharge capacity is more than the drinking water requirements, the excess \nwater may be diverted for irrigation.  \nThe  village  organization  must  agree  to  provide  implementation  management, \nlabor,  and  local  materials  free  of  cost;  and  ensure  maintenance  through  own \nsources after scheme completion. \n\nIrrigation Systems \n\nCriteria for selecting irrigation subprojects include the following: \n\nThe schemes should be free of conflict with regard to land or water rights. \nThe  village  organization  must  ensure  equity.  (For  example  the  construction  of \nsurface  irrigation  schemes  must  benefit  all  potential  farmers  and  not  just  those \nlocated at the head reaches.)  \nVillagers must provide land and to the extent possible local materials and labor \nfree of cost.   \nDevelopment  of  surface  irrigation  schemes  must  be  assessed  for  its  impact  on \ndownstream users.  \nDugwell- and tubewell-based schemes should only be recommended for farmer \ngroups that are willing to contribute a minimum of 50% of the costs, both capital \nand recurrent. Dug wells should be awarded to groups comprising a minimum of \n4 farmers, while the tubewell-based schemes should be awarded to groups with \na minimum of 8 farmers.  \nLand ownership of one farmer should not exceed 25% of the total command area \nunder the scheme.  \nPreference  should  be  given  to  resident  landowners  as  opposed  to  absentee \nlandowners.  \n\n(viii)  A  minimum  of  6  hectares  (ha)  of  land  for  dug  wells  and  18  ha  of  land  for \n\ntubewell-based schemes must be available to justify costs.  \nAquifer  discharge  must  yield  a  minimum  of  1  liter  per  second/ha  to  satisfy  crop \nwater requirements.  \nDugwells  or  tubewells  should  not  be  sunk  within  the  influence  area  of  existing \nwells.   \n\nIrrigation Ponds and Small Reservoirs \n\nSelection criteria include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\nSmall  reservoir  facilities  should  be  sited  in  areas  with  greater  than  75% \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\n2. \n \n\n \nC. \n\n3. \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nprobability that design fill capacity will be met on an annual basis. \nDevelopment  of  small  reservoir  facilities  and  ponds  should  not  affect  water \nsupplies (ground and surface) currently exploited for domestic or other productive \nuses unless compensation schemes agreeable to all parties can be devised. \nSmall  reservoirs  and  ponds  should  be  sited  to  minimize  conveyance  and \nevaporative losses and measures taken to minimize loss of the resource. \nLabor-intensive  construction  techniques  should  be  used  and  local  community \nmembers  and  beneficiaries  should  be  employed  or  contribute \nto \ndevelopment activities. \nSmall  reservoirs  and  ponds  must  be  developed  with  one  or  more  associated \ncommunity  to  contribute  labor  for  annual  maintenance  activities  that  can  be \nfulfilled with their resources. \nFor  selected  storages  and  ponds,  communities  should  agree  to  voluntarily \nprovide  land  for  both  construction  of  the  storage  facility,  the  inundation  area, \nmain canals to irrigation areas, and any appurtenant structures. Sites should be \nselected  to  minimize  the  loss  of  any  productive  resources,  especially  cultivable \nland, from development of the facility. \nSmall  reservoirs  should  only  be  developed  in  areas  where  more  cost-effective \nand  less  disruptive  water  supplies  (such  as  groundwater)  cannot  be  developed \nand dams should be restricted to a maximum height of 6 meters. \n\nlabor \n\n(viii)  Development  of  small  reservoirs  and  ponds  must  meet  all  social  and \nenvironmental safeguard policies, and no project will be undertaken that involves \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \nSmall reservoirs must be developed with international best practice for safety and \nshould not increase flood risk to local communities. \n\n(ix) \n\nLow-Cost Link Roads \n\nSelection criteria include the following: \n\nA  low-cost  link  road  should  aim  to  serve  a  minimum  of  three  villages  with  an \naverage  population  of  2,500.  The  second  category  of  roads  (i.e.,  upgrading  of \nexisting  roads)  should  satisfy  a  similar  requirement  prior  to  selection  under  the \nProject.   \nThe targeted cluster (of villages) should preferably have agricultural potential that \ncould be exploited with the provision of a new or improved road.   \nThe  proposed  roads  should  not  be  an  isolated  (or  unconnected)  section  and \nmust link with other district or provincial road networks.   \nRoad lengths, providing missing links and improving the connectivity of an area, \nshould be given priority.  \nIn  deciding  between  new  roads  and  improvements  to  existing  tracks,  priority \nshould  be  given  to  large  population  clusters  totally  unconnected  with  any  road \nnetwork.  \nCommunities  must  agree  to  maintain  and  repair  the  jeepable  tracks  through  a \nvillage self-help or local maintenance and repair fund contributed by beneficiary \nhouseholds.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\n4. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\nSHALMAN TO LANDI KOTAL WATER SUPPLY SCHEME IN KHYBER AGENCY \n\n1. \nThe  proposed  Shalman  to  Landi  Kotal  water  supply  scheme  is  expected  to  serve \napproximately 78,000 people by 2030. The population in the coverage area is about 31,700, of \nwhich  30\u201340%  are  estimated  to  be  associated  with  the  military  scouts  (9,500\u201312,000)  and \nresiding in the cantonment area. The military needs are about the same as the available water \nfrom two existing sources. Currently the water shortage is acute as the needs are estimated to \nbe  5.7  million  liters/day  and  only  about  946,000  liters/day  are  available  from  rapidly  depleting \nsources; thus only 17% of user needs is being met. As a result, the military cantonment could \ndivert  all  of  the  water  from  the  existing  sources  and  thus  no  water  would  be  available  to  the \ngeneral public. For many reasons, the water supply is also not being treated on a regular basis \nunless the public health department or hospital informs the operator of large-scale illness in the \ncommunity  and  then  only  a  few  handfuls  of  powdered  chlorine  are  thrown  into  the  storage \nreservoirs. The design requirements of the proposed scheme have been estimated to be about \n12.5 million liters/day by 2030. The estimated cost of the scheme is about $5.6 million.1 \n \nThe  entire  installation  is  located  in  a  rather  remote  region  of  Khyber  Agency,  but  is \n2. \naccessible in about 1 hour by a relatively good black-topped and gravel road from Landi Kotal to \nthe  pump  intake  installation  site  on  the  Kabul  River,  where  the  river  forms  the  boundary \nbetween  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan.  Low  flows  during  the  dry  season  are  estimated  by  the \nGovernment to be about 54 cubic-meters/second. The design of the entire system is considered \nto  be  relatively  simple  and  construction  relatively  straightforward.  The  system  will  draw  water \nfrom a series of infiltration galleries along the Kabul River, pump up the hills through a series of \nin-line pumping stations, to a reservoir located on the top of the hill. From the top of the hill, the \nflow  is  then  gravity  to  a  series  of  storage  tank  reservoirs.  The  design  intake  of  .20  cubic \nmeter/second  is  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  low  discharge  and  thus  should  not  affect \ndownstream riparian rights to the water.  \n \nThe primary infiltration gallery, with intake discharge of .20 cubic meter/second, is based \n3. \non  various  demands,  losses,  and  user  requirements  as  determined  by  standards  used  in \nPakistan.  The  intake  would  be  installed  underground  on  the  right  bank  of  the  Kabul  River \n(Pakistan  side)  and  include  an  infiltration  chamber  and  piping  to  a  pumping  chamber  for  the \nprimary  pumping  plant.  On-line  intermediate  pumping  stations  with  two  main  lines  will  be \nconstructed including small tank reservoirs, and one additional storage tank reservoir at the top \nof  the  Anzari  Top  hill.  From  the  Anzari  Top  tank  reservoir,  piping  will  be  provided  to  existing \nstorage  tanks.  Improvements  will  be  required  for  the  existing  distribution  system  and  pumping \nfacilities.  \n \n4. \nconditions will be met: \n \n\nPrior  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approval  for  scheme  financing,  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nA socioeconomic survey will be undertaken to identify the target population of the \nservice area of Landi Kotal town and other served areas, particularly the military \nand  general  public,  as  well  as  Afghan  refugees.  As  part  of  the  socioeconomic \nsurvey,  a  review  will  determine  willingness  to  pay  by  the  beneficiaries  (water \nservice  fees).  In  addition,  based  on  the  detailed  designs  an  environmental \nassessment  and  resettlement/land  acquisition  plan  will  be  prepared  and \n\n                                                 \n1   Based  on  2004  cost  estimates  PRs318,145,000  without  inflation  or  contingencies.  Details  are  shown  in  the \n\neconomic analysis section (paras. 55-56 \u2013 of the main text). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\napproved  by  the  appropriate  Pakistani  government  agency  and  ADB.  An \neconomic analysis will also be carried out. \n\nAs typical for urban water supply schemes, an equitable water tariff plan will have \nto be determined and possibly a new collection agency or authority considered to \ncover  all  or  a  portion  of  the  anticipated  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  To \nmeasure water used and fees, water measuring meters or similar devices should \nbe considered for each connection. \n\nTo meet health requirements, water treatment will be part of the system with an \nautomatic  chlorination  injection  system  installed  and  stockpiles  of  a  sufficient \nsupply  of  liquid  chlorine  guaranteed  to  the  operator.  The  volume  of  chlorine \ninjected  into  the  system  will  be  determined  based  on  best  principles  of  treating \npotable water. \n\nFor  safety  purposes,  mainline  flow-metering  devices,  pressure  control  valves, \nmanually  operated  closure  valves,  and  other  safety  devices  will  be  installed  to \nprovide  safety  to  the  system  in  case  of  unexpected  shutdowns,  repairs,  and \nroutine maintenance. \n\nAs  part  of  the  review  process  and  prior  to  ADB  approval,  an  expert  panel  of \nconsultants  will  review  the  overall  plans,  detailed  designs  and  implementation \nplans,  and  environmental  needs  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  mechanical-\nelectrical equipment and distribution system. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n31 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nResettlement Policy Framework \n\nThe Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (as amended) is the core legislation used in Pakistan \n1. \nfor acquiring private lands for a public purpose. As with most other laws of Pakistan, the act is \nnot  applicable  to  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas  (FATA).  Local  needs  for  land \nacquisition  are  addressed  through  the  tribal  system  of  land  rights  and  distribution.  In  the \nabsence of a formal legal policy for land acquisition and resettlement, a project-specific set of \nresettlement principles consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy requirements has \nbeen adopted for the Project. In general terms, the people affected will be compensated for the \nloss  of  their  land  and  trees,  and  assisted  financially  to  restore  their  affected  structures/assets \nand  livelihoods,  at  least  to  pre-project  levels.  Households  headed  by  women  and  other \nvulnerable  households  will  be  eligible  for  further  cash  assistance  for  relocation  and  house  or \nstructure reconstruction. Plans for subproject resettlement will be based on a full evaluation of \nthe impact of proposals and contain a complete list of all those affected together with the type \nand size of losses, along with the amount of compensation and/or financial assistance assessed \nfor each person affected.  \n\nB. \n\nInstitutional Framework  \n\n2. \nThe Governor\u2019s Secretariat (FATA) and the political administrations (the political agents\u2019 \noffices)  of  the  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand  agencies  are  familiar  with  the  procedure  and \npractice of land acquisition. FATA resettlement will be conducted through a land acquisition and \nresettlement cell (LARC), which will be established in the Peshawar-based project management \nunit.  The  LARC  will  be  headed  by  a  chief  resettlement  officer  (grade-18  officer)  and  will  be \nassisted  in  field  by  three  agency  resettlement  officers.  For  each  of  the  three  subareas,  the \nBajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand  agencies  will  have  a  political  tehsildar  assigned  to  attend \nspecifically to the project-related land acquisition and resettlement activities.  \n\n3. \nCurrently, these government agencies do not have the capacity to plan and implement \nthe  resettlement  activities  as  desired  by  ADB  because  they  lack  the  expertise  required  for \nplanning and implementing involuntary resettlement under ADB policy and guidelines. To fill in \nthe  gap,  a  resettlement  specialist  will  be  included  in  the  supervisory  consultants  team  for  the \nentire project period, to provide the necessary technical assistance for the PMU and agencies, \non a continual basis. In addition, a nongovernment organization (NGO) hired by the Project to \nprovide assistance in community organization/participation activities will also be responsible for \nproviding  assistance  to  the  LARC,  under  the  guidance  of  resettlement  specialist,  in \nimplementing the resettlement plans in an effective manner. It will have a specific role to play in \ninformation  disclosure  and  conflict  resolution  pursuits,  especially  in  matters  related  to \nentitlements and compensation payments to people affected. The NGO will also be responsible \nfor ensuring that all procedures for voluntary land donated under the Project are conducted in a \ntransparent manner and that land is donated without duress. \n\nC. \n\nResettlement Procedural Guidelines \n\n4. \nSpecific  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  have  been  established  to  guide  the \npreparation of appropriate resettlement plans that will be adequate for the magnitude of the land \nacquisition for subsequent subprojects. These resettlement procedure guidelines require that: (i) \nthe LARC agency resettlement officers/to carry out an initial social assessment survey once the \nscope of each subproject is identified, based on its preliminary technical designs; (ii) if impacts \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nare found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d the LARC will prepare a full resettlement plan for each subproject; \nand  (iii)  if  subproject  impacts  are  less  than  significant  (i.e.,  affecting  less  than  200  people  or \naffecting  households  that  lose  less  than  10%  of  their  productive  assets),  a  short  resettlement \nplan  will  be  prepared.  Both  full  and  short  resettlement  plans  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. \n\nD. \n\nCompensation Principles and Entitlements \n\nTable  A6.1  presents  the  compensation  principles  and  entitlements  proposed  to  ensure \n\n5. \nreinstatement of livelihoods for people affected by the Project. \n\nType of Losses \n\nBarren or nullah-bed \nnonproductive lands \nowned by tribes, \nclans, or subclans \ncollectively  \n\nTable A6.1: Project Compensation Principles and Entitlements \n\nEntitlement \n\n\u2022  Large-scale land acquisition compensated for in cash, based on current \nprices, and/or as negotiated with the village/tribal jirga (a council of tribal \nelders) \n\n\u2022  Small-scale land acquisition/utilization for collective benefit of immediate \n\ncommunity free, as no one will be affected  \n\n\u2022  Tribal commission at 6.25% of total estimated cost of construction of the \nproposed subproject provided if the tribal jirga and/or the group of people \naffected voluntarily opt for it  \n\nLoss of agricultural \nland, crops, and trees \nby owners, tenants, \nand sharecroppers \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation for land based on current open market value, or as \nnegotiated with landowners\u2019 or decided by the tribal/village elders\u2019 jirga \n\u2022  Permanent/traditional tenants paid part of the compensation, as mutually \nnegotiated and agreed with, or as decided by the tribal elders\u2019 jirga, which \nmay be 25%, 33%, or 50% of the total assessed amount  \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation for loss of crops at current market value of mature \n\ncrops \n\n\u2022  Compensation for loss of crops/trees to sharecropper/tenants as per their \n\ntraditional share or lease agreement (verbal/written) \n\n\u2022  Compensation for loss of wood trees at current market value \n\u2022  Compensation for loss of fruit trees for average fruit production for next 10 \n\nyears computed at the current market value  \n\n\u2022  Encroachers/squatters not eligible for compensation for land;

The  resettlement  policy  framework  will  be  made  available  in  the  Urdu \nlanguage and explained in Pashto language during focus group village meetings. Copies of draft \nresettlement  plans  will  be  distributed  among  community  groups  for  local  inputs  prior  to \nfinalization of the detailed design, and after the socioeconomic survey has been carried out to \navoid  fraudulent  claims.  Complaints  and  grievance  procedures  will  be  outlined  in  each \nresettlement  plan  and  grievance  redress  committees  will  be  established  at  each  agency  for \nsubprojects.  This  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  political  agent,  assisted  by  a  political \ntehsildar,  with  representatives  from  the  LARC,  line  departments,  those  affected,  and  project \nNGOs.  For  all  disputes  other  than  those  relating  to  legal  ownership  rights,  the  committee  will \nreview  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits,  relocation,  and  other  assistance. \nGrievances will be redressed within 2\u20134 weeks from the date of lodging the complaints. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n7. \nThe LARC will establish an internal monitoring system involving the agency resettlement \nofficer/political  tehsildar  and  implementing  staff.  They  will  prepare  monthly  internal  progress \nreports on all aspects of land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement activities.

Other \ndata, such as rainfall and runoff, are available or can be correlated from elsewhere. \n\nMicro-catchments  and  subwatersheds  can  be  easily  identified  from  the  maps  and \naerial photographs. \n\nAccess by road is available to the subwatershed. \n\nSeveral different types of project interventions are identified in the subwatershed. \n\nHomogeneity of the area. \n\nAdministrative control is not divided in the area. \n\nEthnically,  culturally,  and  socially  the  population  in  the  subwatershed  is  generally  a \nhomogenous group. \n\nThe  subwatershed  is  devoid  of  major  conflicts;  either  external  or  internal,  and \nsecurity is not a major concern. \n\nApproximately  60%  of  a  subwatershed  population  is  identified  as  poor  and  living \nbelow the poverty line for the area. \n\n10. \n\nVillage  elders  of  potential  villages  are  aware  of  the  project  interventions  and  have \nindicated a willingness to participate. \n\n11. \n\nCommunal lands are not shared with other watersheds. \n\nUpper  watershed  area  is  considered  to  be  in  critical  condition  with  deforestation, \nsteep slopes, and gully erosion easily noticeable. \n\nNo other aid-funded project is being implemented in the watershed with similar types \nof interventions. \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fSUBPROJECT INTERVENTION PROCEDURES \n\nTask \n\nTiming/Duration \n\nADB Approval\n\nFirst month of Project, \nadjusted annually as \nrequired \n3rd month of Project and \nannually \nAnnually \n\n5b  Prepare designs and cost estimates for \n\n1 month \n\n5c  Prepare detailed construction plans and \n\n1 month \n\n38 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \nNo \n\n1  Develop watershed selection criteriaa \n\n2  Select potential watersheds \n\n3  Describe the Project to potential communities in \n\neach selected watershed \n\n4  Discuss potential subprojects with communities \nand village elders/tribal leaders concerned \nIdentify potential subprojects in selected \nwatersheds by carrying out the following \nactivities: \n\n5 \n\n5a  Carry out the following activities in the potential \n\nsubprojects: \n(i)  socioeconomic profile in the subproject \n\narea; \n\n(ii)  various surveys and investigations; and \n(iii)  compliance assessments (i.e., environment, \n\nresettlement, etc.) \n\nappropriate subproject intervention with input \nfrom the beneficiaries \n \n\neconomic analysis \n \n\n5d  Prepare environmental impact assessment, \nenvironmental management plan, and \nresettlement/land acquisition plan as required \n  \n\n5e  Prepare partnership agreement, cost-sharing \n\narrangements for O&M, and other terms of \npartnership \n \n\n5f  Form a community organization or water user \nassociation using World Bank On-Farm Water \nManagement Project procedures, as adopted \n \n\n5g  Finalize construction arrangements and \nparticipation role of the beneficiaries \n \n\n5h  Finalize cost-sharing arrangements for O&M \nbetween the agency and beneficiaries, with \nagreement of the community organization and/or \ntribal leaders \n \n\n \n\n \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nYesb \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnually \n\nAnnually \n\n1 month \n \n1 month \n \n1\u20133 months \n\n1\u20136 months \n\n1 month \n\n1 month \n\n1 month \n\n1 month \n\n\fTask \n\nTiming/Duration \n\nADB Approval\n\n1 month \n\n1 month \n\n3\u20136 months \n\n \n3 months \n\n3\u20136 months \n \n\nHave O&M cost-sharing agreement signed by \nthe agency and community organization \n \nEstablish an O&M joint savings bank account \nfor the subproject \n \nAgree on land acquisition compensation \narrangements as required \n \nComplete preconstruction of the subproject: \n(i)  determine the type of year 1 contract and \n\nvarious arrangements, \n\n(ii)   prequalify contractors and hold prebid \n\nmeeting, and \n\n(iii)  submit and evaluate bids and awards \n \nConstruct the subproject: \n(i)  provide notice to proceed, \n(ii)  complete construction, \n(iii)  supervise construction, and \n(iv)  complete subproject \n \nInitiate the monitoring and evaluation system \nas designed \n \nModify the environmental management plan \n \nOfficially turn over the subproject to the village \norganization beneficiaries \n \nProvide assistance to the village organization \nfor O&M on a declining basis \n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n39 \n\nYesb \n \nNo \n \nYes, with \u201cno \nobjection\u201d letter \nfrom ADB\u201d \nNo \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nImmediately after completion \n\nNo \n\nAs required \n\n9\u201312 months after \ncompletion \n\nAnnually on a declining \nbasis; 100% of estimated \nO&M cost for 1 year \nfollowing turnover of the \nsubproject that would be \nreduced by 25% each \nsuccessive year.

Water  resource \ndevelopment  and  conservation  is  a  key  input  and  most  of  the  consulting  inputs  address  water \nresource  and  watershed  planning  and  management,  establishing  suitable  engineering  standards \nand  quality  control,  establishing  monitoring  and  measurement  facilities  as  required,  undertaking \ntechnical  designs,  assessing  economic,  environmental  and  social  viability  of  interventions, \nundertaking  general  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  undertaking  community  forestry  activities.  A \ntotal  of  147  person-months  of  consulting  services  inputs,  comprising  21  person-months  of \ninternational  and  126  person-months  of  domestic,  will  be  engaged  through  a  consulting \nconsortium.  In  addition,  2  person-months  of  individual  consulting  services  inputs  are  required  to \nserve on a review panel for the proposed Shalman to Landi Kotal water supply scheme. \n \n2. \nIn addition to the proposed consulting services specified in Table A12, technical assistance \n(through service contracts) is needed for: (i) a baseline survey; (ii) community mobilization activities \nand a public information campaign; (iii) periodic independent audits of project performance; (iv) a \nsurface-  and  groundwater  assessment  study;  and  (v)  establishment  and  implementation  of  the \nproject  management  information  system.  The  baseline  survey  will  be  undertaken  in  the  first  year \nand  be  the  basis  for  designing  the  project  management  information  system.  The  community \nmobilization  and  information  dissemination  program  will  be  aimed  at  involving  beneficiaries  in \nproject  activities  from  the  outset.  Line  departments  and  project  staff  will  receive  training  in \ncommunity  facilitation  and  mobilization  prior  to  commencing  work  with  communities.  Periodic \nindependent performance audits will be undertaken  to strengthen governance measures adopted \nby  the  project.  The  water  resources  assessment  study  (surface  and  groundwater  sources  in  the \nthree  agencies)  will  evaluate  existing  information  and  provide  critical  information  for  identification \nand  location/design  of  new  water  resources  structures,  particularly  for  the  installation  of  any \nproposed  deep  tubewells.  The  project  management  information  system  will  be  established  to \nmonitor  physical  and  financial  progress  as  well  as  to  assess  the  development  impacts  of  the \nproject. The system will link the implementing and executing agencies to the PMU and PIUs. \n\nExpertise \n\nTable A12: Consulting Services  \n\nPerson Months \n\n \n\nInternational \n\nDomestic \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n20b \n\nConsulting Consortium \nWater Resources Specialist, Team \nLeader \nEnvironment  \nNatural Resources Management (3) \nWatershed Planning and Management  \nHydraulic Engineering/Dams  \nGeohydrology \nHydrology (2) \nEconomics \nIrrigation On-Farm Water Management  \nResettlement  \nReview Panela (Individual Consultants) \nWater Supply Engineering \nElectromechanical Engineering \n \na  To review the proposed Shalman to Landi Kotal water supply scheme. \nb    A  suitably  qualified  domestic  consultant  may  be  considered,  subject  to  ADB  approval,  if  prevailing  conditions \n\n10 \n24 \n9 \n18 \n24 \n16 \n3 \n3 \n18 \n \n       1 \n        1 \n147 \n\n10 \n24 \n9 \n18 \n24 \n16 \n3 \n3 \n18 \n \n \n1 \n126 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n21 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nmake it difficult to recruit a suitable international consultant. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n43 \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION \n\nIntroduction \n\nProject Benefits  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Rural Development Project is designed \n1. \nto  enhance  rural  livelihoods  in  three  of  the  FATA  agencies:  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand. \nProject  components  include  resource  management  activities  in  agriculture,  livestock,  and \nforestry;  as  well  as  infrastructure  investments  in  irrigation,  rural  roads,  and  drinking  water \nfacilities.  Given  the  interaction  between  elements  of  forestry,  livestock,  and  agriculture, \nproposed project interventions will be concentrated in chosen micro-watersheds within the three \nagencies.  As  such, specific  project interventions  have  not  yet  been  chosen.  Instead,  selection \ncriteria  have  been  devised  for  prospective  micro-watersheds,  as  well  as  for  potential \ninterventions within those watersheds. Project implementation will be difficult and rely on a team \nof community mobilizers to work closely with target beneficiaries and line department officials. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nBenefits and costs are examined both in economic and financial terms to look at not only \nthe  economic  viability  of  the  Project  but  also  the  expected  impact  on  various  sectors  of  local \nsociety.  Project  investments  are  planned  over  5  years.  The  life  of  the  Project,  however,  is \nexpected to be for 20 years after the time of a particular intervention. For this analysis, the costs \nof each intervention as well as its benefits are calculated for two alternative situations: \u201cwith\u201d the \nProject and \u201cwithout\u201d the Project.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nFinancial prices used in this analysis were identified through a survey of the project area \nconducted  by  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  team.  To  assess  the  Project\u2019s \ncontributions  to  the  Pakistan  economy  financial  values  must  be  converted  into  their  economic \nequivalents. Basic assumptions used in the economic part of the analysis include \n \n\nEconomic Pricing \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe use of a domestic price numeraire; \nvalues are expressed in constant 2004 prices to exclude inflation; \nthe  Pakistan  rupee  (PRe)  is  the  unit  of  account;  the  exchange  rate  used  is \nPRs59.7 = $1;1 \neconomic  values  for  major  tradable  commodities  (notably  major  food  grains  as \nwell  as  fertilizers  and  milk)  are  based  on  border  parity  prices,  and  a  standard \nconversion factor of 0.9 is used for nontraded goods and services; and a shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.8 is used for male labor and 0.7 for female labor; and \ntransfer payments such as taxes and subsidies are excluded in the calculation of \neconomic values. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nD. \n \nEconomic analyses were performed for each of the six project subcomponents. Results \n4. \n(and  pertinent  methodologies  used)  for  these  subcomponent  analyses  are  described  here. \nCosts  applied  to  these  subcomponents  include  both  the  costs  of  direct  investment  (in  crop \ndemonstrations, training, infrastructure, etc.) as well as implementation costs of the appropriate \n\n                                                 \n1   This was the exchange rate in September 2005. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nline  agencies  involved.  Only  the  costs  of  the  project  management  unit  and  agency  project \nimplementation  units  are  included  in  the  calculation  of  over-all  project  returns.  Benefits  have \nbeen phased in according to the date of expected investments and (for the farming, livestock, \nand irrigation models) scheduled to take a few years to reach their expected potential.2 \n \n5. \nFarming Systems and Crop Production. This intervention will involve the introduction \nof  improved  seed  technology  and  farming  demonstration  plots,  adaptive  research  trials,  field \nscreening for appropriate varieties, integrated crop management training, farmer field days, and \ntraining  of  extension  staff.  Approximately  52,500  ha  are  expected  to  be  affected.  Based  on \nincremental  net  crop  income,  this  subcomponent  is  expected  to  be  economically  viable.    The \neconomic net present value (ENPV) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) are displayed \nin  Table  A13  (along  with  the  results  of  all  the  other  subcomponents.  The  ENPV  is  PRs  402.3 \nmillion ($6.9 million) while the EIRR is 37.3%. \n \n6. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  subcomponent  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  benefits \nand  costs  over  the  life  of  the  Project  will  be  as  calculated.  The  future,  of  course,  may  not \nperfectly follow that assumption. Sensitivity tests regarding specific alternative assumptions are \nalso detailed in Table A13. They include tests for risks of (i) an increase in investment cost, (ii) \nbenefit  shortfalls,  (iii)  yield  decreases,  (iv)  product  price  decreases,  (v)  a  shortfall  in  project \nimplementation,  and  (vi)  a  decrease  in  the  project  life.  For  each  risk  variable  the  EIRR  is \nrecalculated assuming a 20% change. The switching value for that variable (beyond which the \nEIRR would fall below 12%) and a sensitivity measure are also calculated.3 The base EIRR for \nthis subcomponent was sufficiently high that none of the risk variables would appear to seriously \nthreaten  the  viability  of  the  intervention.  Overall,  the  farming  systems  and  crop  production \nsubcomponent should show strong returns.  \n \n7. \nLivestock  and  Fodder  Development.  The  Project  plans  interventions  to  improve \nanimal  husbandry  practices  and  feed  management.  Activities  will  include  fodder  production \ndemonstration  plots,  training  of  village  animal  husbandry  extension  workers,  and  exposing \nfarmers  to  improved  techniques  through  farmer  field  days  and  visits  to  public-sector  livestock \ninstitutions.  Livestock  staff  will  also  be  trained.  Benefits  to  livestock  will  also  accrue  from  the \nrange  management  portion  of  the  forestry  subcomponent.  Forty-six  thousand  households  are \nexpected  to  ultimately  benefit  from  this  program.  This  subcomponent  is  expected  to  be \neconomically  viable  with  an  ENPV  of  PRs77.8  million  ($1.3  million)  and  an  EIRR  of  17.8  %. \nSensitivity tests performed covered similar risks already discussed (Table A13). None of these \nrisk variables showed the potential to seriously threaten this subcomponent\u2019s returns. \n \nCommunity  Forestry  and  Range  Management.  The  community  forestry  and  range \n8. \nmanagement  subcomponent \nfarmer-managed  and \ndepartment-managed  nurseries,  as  well  as  farmer-,  community-,  and  department-managed \nforest  plantations.  Quantified  benefits  include  the  production  of  these  enterprises.  In  addition, \ngiven the environmental benefits of forest establishment and stabilization, an attempt has been \nmade  to  quantify  the  value  of  a  decrease  in  the  without-project  rate  of  environmental \n\nthe  establishment  of  both \n\nincludes \n\n                                                 \n2   The full economic analysis can be found in Supplementary Appendix H. \n3   Sensitivity is the absolute value of the percent change in the EIRR divided by the percent change in the risk factor. \nA sensitivity level that is greater than 1.0 indicates that a percent change in the risk factor will cause a change in \nthe EIRR of more than 1% of its base case value indicating a relatively high degree of sensitivity to the risk. The \nopposite is the case when the sensitivity measure is less than 1.0. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n45 \n\ndegradation.4 The community forestry and range management program is expected to have an \nENPV  of  PRs244.5  million  ($  4.2  million)  and  an  EIRR  of  17.5%.  These  results  indicate  a \ndegree of economic viability. Sensitivity tests were performed on the usual cost, benefit, yield, \nprice,  level  of  implementation,  and  project  life  risk  variables,  as  well  as  on  the  environmental \nbenefit estimate. Again, none of these variables appear to bring great cause for concern. \n \n9. \nIrrigation  Development.  The  irrigation  interventions  include  a  variety  of  schemes\u2014\nsmall  ponds,  new  and  rehabilitated  surface  systems,  tubewells,  dug  wells,  small  check  dams, \nand  slightly  larger  delayed  action  dams.  Irrigation  allows  farmers  to  adopt  higher  value  crops \nand a higher cropping intensity. While marketing of higher value crops may be an issue, areas \nin  the  agencies  recently  opened  up  with  rural  roads  have  shown  a  good  increase  in  the \nproduction of vegetables for the Peshawar market. The marketing potential is growing. \n \n10. \nFor  the  various  types  of  schemes  combined,  the  EIRR  is  14.6%  and  the  ENPV  is \nPRs88.1 ($1.5 million). Sensitivity tests indicate that modest negative changes in a number of \nthe  benefit,  cost,  yield,  and  price  risk  variables  may  threaten  the  viability  of  the  irrigation \nsubcomponent. While the sensitivity values of these risks are not all high (except for vegetable \nyields),  the  base  case  EIRR  is  sufficiently  close  to  the  12%  critical  level  as  to  make  these \nvariables  a  real  risk  to  subproject  viability.  During  project  implementation,  an  especially \nimportant activity will be ensuring that farmers see the value of adopting crop technologies that \nirrigation makes possible and that they understand the importance of maintaining their systems \nwith proper operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \n11. \nRoad  Construction  and  Upgrading.  The  construction  of  new  shingle  roads  (and  the \nupgrading  of  others)  will  better  link  communities  to  main  roads  and  the  outside  economy  and \nservices  (such  as  educational  and  health  facilities).  This  will  make  communication  easier  and \ngreatly  decrease  the  cost  of  transporting  rural  inputs  and  production.  Based  on  vehicle \noperating  costs  and  passenger  time  savings,  the  shingle  roads  program  is  expected  to  be \neconomically viable. The EIRR is 16.5% and the ENPV is PRs124.4. Sensitivity tests show no \nmajor threats to viability. \n \n12. \nDrinking  Water  Supply.  Many  FATA  communities  have  problems  with  drinking  water \navailability  and  quality.  The  Project  will  help  build  a  number  of  domestic  water  schemes, \nincluding  dug-well,  gravity-flow,  tubewell,  and  hand-pump  systems.  Benefits  from  these \nschemes include decreased water-fetching times (primarily involving women) and improvements \nin the health of household members using safer water with the Project. 5 The EIRR is 31.0% and \nthe ENPV is PRs302.0 million ($5.2 million); none of the risk variables tested appeared to pose \na major threat to viability. This subcomponent, overall, seems to have solid returns.  \n \n13. \nOverall  Project.  The  six  project  subcomponent  models  were  combined  and  project \nimplementation costs included. The EIRR for the Project is 19.1% and the ENVP is PRs1,036.1 \nmillion ($17.7 million). The Project as a whole, as with its subcomponent parts, can be expected \nto have solid economic returns. \n\n                                                 \n4   Calculations are based on an assumption that without the Project, the level of agricultural and livestock production \n(found in the agriculture and livestock models) will decrease at a rate of 1% per year. A project benefit is found by \nassuming that project interventions will cause a decrease in that rate of degradation to 0.5%. These assumptions \nwere deemed reasonable, but are not based on any studies or secondary sources. \n\n5   The proposed Shalman water supply scheme for Landi Kotal in the Khyber Agency (proposed by the Government \nafter  the  project  preparatory  TA  analysis  of  the  Project)  has  not  been  included  in  this  analysis  given  that  a  full \nfeasibility analysis (including necessary social and environmental effects) has not yet been completed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nHousehold Returns and Poverty Implications \n\nE. \n \n14. \nOfficial  statistics  on  rural  income  and  poverty  in  the  FATA  area  are  quite  weak.  The \nproject preparatory TA effort did include a social survey, but given the social constraints within \nthe FATA agencies the use of a random sample was impossible. Most houses are very private \n(even  fortress-like)  and  gaining  access  to  potential  respondents  was  very  difficult  and  often \nimpossible. Also, the locations of the actual project interventions have not yet been determined, \nso  specific  information  about  definite  project  beneficiaries  is  unavailable.  Nevertheless,  it  is \nuseful to at least speculate upon how possible project beneficiaries may fare. \n \n15. \nThe farming systems and crop management subcomponent is expected to affect 52,500 \nhectares (ha). Farm size has been roughly estimated in the three agencies as about 1.4 ha per \nhousehold.  That  would  indicate  about  37,500  beneficiary  households  (or  about  337,500 \npeople6).  After  a  full  phasing  in  of  benefits,  incremental  farm  income  for  these  households \nshould increase by about PRs5,900 per year on average.7  \n \nFor the irrigation development subcomponent (which also uses incremental crop income \n16. \nas its primary benefit), the area coverage is expected to be 6,644 ha. This translates into about \n4,750 households as beneficiaries (or 42,750 people). Per household, incremental income will \nbe about PRs54,900 per year after a full phasing in of irrigation effects.  \n \n17. \nThe  livestock  and  fodder  management  subcomponent  is  aimed  at  46,000  households \n(414,000  people).  The  increase  in  milk  production  and  animal  live  weight  can  be  expected  to \nbring in a modest PRs1,600 per household annually. \n \n18. \nIn  the  community  forestry  and  range  management  subcomponent,  the  calculation  of \nproject  beneficiaries  is  problematic.  Some  family  seedling  nurseries  and  small  plantations  will \nparticipate,  but  the  bulk  of  the  benefits  are  expected  to  accrue  from  larger  department-  and \ncommunity-managed plantations. The environmental benefits will also be communitywide. \n \n19. \ndifficult to estimate so a calculation of per household benefits is not very credible.  \n \n20. \nFor  the  drinking  water  supply  subcomponent,  assumptions  are  made  regarding  the \nhousehold  coverage  of  the  various  types  of  scheme.  By  this  calculation,  about  17,850 \nhouseholds (or 160,650 people) will benefit from decreased water-fetching time and decreased \nhealth costs. Per household, this benefit is valued at about PRs8,400 per year. \n \n21. \nInfrastructure  O&M  as  a  Beneficiary  Household  Responsibility.  For  most  of  the \nirrigation schemes and all of the drinking water supply schemes, the responsibility for O&M will \nlie with the beneficiary households. For the drinking water schemes (averaging the four types), \nO&M costs can be expected to be about 10% of the value of the annual household benefit. For \nirrigation  schemes,  average  O&M  costs  will  be  about  12.5%  of  the  financial  benefits.  In  both \ncases,  sufficient  incentives  should  be  provided  for  the  beneficiary  communities  to  make  sure \nthat their schemes continue to function well.  \n\nSimilarly  for  the  rural  roads  subcomponent,  the  number  of  benefiting  households  is \n\n                                                 \n6   The  TA  survey  indicated  that  household  size  is  about  9.  Some  sources  raise  that  to  10  persons  per  household.  \n\nNine persons per household is used here. \n\n7   For  financial  returns  to  farm  households,  farm  labor  is  counted  as  costless.  If,  in  fact,  incremental  labor  needs \nrequire an increase in hired labor or if some other opportunity cost arises for family members having to put more \ntime into farming activities, this figure will be less. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\n \n22. \nEmployment.  Some  of  the  Project\u2019s  interventions  can  be  expected  to  generate  long-\nterm incremental employment opportunities. An attempt to quantify this employment effect has \nbeen  made.  The  agriculture  program  may  generate  585,000  incremental  labor  days  per  year. \nSome  of  this  labor  will  fall  to  hired  workers,  providing  some  opportunity  for  additional \nhouseholds  to  benefit  from  this  subcomponent.  Similarly,  irrigation  development  can  be \nexpected  to  increase  labor  days  on  farms  by  919,500.  The  forestry  and  range  management \nsubcomponent will hire an average of 123,500 labor days a year.  \n \n23. \nPoverty  Impacts.  Specific  information  about  poverty  in  the  FATA  agencies  is  lacking. \nEstimates  for  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand,  indicate  that  the  proportion  of  households  living \nbelow  the  poverty  line  (currently  estimated  at  PRs774  per  person  per)  is  over  60%.  In  some \ncommunities  it  may  be  as  high  as  80%.  For  such  a  high  proportion  of  the  population,  a \nsignificant  number  of  the  poor  in  the  target  communities  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the \nProject.  Also,  given  the  wide  variety  of  project  interventions  into  the  chosen  micro-watershed \nlocations, households below the poverty line will get a share.  \n \n24. \nLandholders  will  receive  most  of  the  benefits  from  the  farming  system  and  irrigation \nsubcomponents.  The  project  preparatory  TA  report  indicates  that  the  poor  own  approximately \n57% of all farms (covering 34% of the farm area). For these two subcomponents, then, roughly \none third of the benefits may go to the poor, and three fifths of the beneficiaries will be poor. \n \n25. \nLivestock program beneficiaries may or may not own land. The poor are more likely to \nconcentrate  on  less  expensive  livestock  (goats,  sheep,  and  chickens,  rather  than  cows  and \nbuffaloes),  but  should  benefit  to  some  degree.  Tribal  communities  running  community  forest \nplantations will share the profits among themselves. Employment opportunities may go largely \nto the landless and other poor. \n \n26.  Most  members  of  the  communities,  including  the  poor,  will  benefit  from  the  road  and \ndrinking water subcomponents. For the smaller drinking water schemes (hand pumps and dug \nwells,  for  example)  efforts  will  need  to  be  taken  to  keep  the  systems  available  to  the  full \ncommunities rather than only to the few households that have taken over the O&M functions. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A13:  Project Level FIRR/EIRR, NPVs, Switching Values, SI, Sensitivity Analysis, and PIRs \n\n4\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n\ni\n\nOverall \nIncluding \nProject \nManagement \nCost \n\n(K) \n\n  \n22.7 \n2,187.2 \n\n  \n26.6 \n2,734.5 \n\nComponent/ \nSubcomponent \n\nFarming \nSystem and \nCrop \nproduction \n\nLivestock and \nFodder \nDevelopment \n\nA+B \n\nA + B + \nRange \nManagement\n\nNursery \nRaising \nAnd \nPlantations \n\nIrrigation\n\nLink \nRoads\n\nDWS&S \nSchemes \n\nMicrohydel \n\nBase Case (Financial) \nBase case FIRR (percent) \nBase case NPV  @ 12 % \nBase Case (Economic) \nBase case EIRR (percent) \nBase case NPV @ 12 % \n\nPIR \n\n(A) \n\n(B) \n\n(C) \n\n  \n57.8  \n861.2  \n\n  \n41.0  \n459.1  \n\n  \n68.5  \n973.7  \n\n  \n55.6  \n5.8  \n\n  \n62.9 \n1,835.0 \n\n  \n48.7 \n1,264.9 \n\n(D) \n\n  \n57.9 \n1,801.8 \n\n  \n44.9 \n1,231.7 \n\n(E) \n\n  \n\n13.0 \n56.4 \n\n  \n11.8 \n21.3 \n\n(G) \n\n  \n25.5 \n621.0 \n\n  \n17.4 \n208.8 \n\n(H) \n\n  \n26.0 \n347.3 \n\n  \n18.5 \n148.2 \n\n(I) \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n44.0 \n1,394.2 \n\n(J) \n\n  \n41.8 \n38.0 \n\n  \n28.0 \n18.5 \n\n0.78  \n\n0.64  \n\n0.69\n\n0.69\n\n1.06 \n\n1.01 \n\n0.88\n\n0.68 \n\n0.41 \n\n0.44 \n\n  \n\nin \n\n77.0 \n\n66.2 \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nchange \n\n84.2 \n1.2 \n532.7 \n0.2 \n\n  \n31.8 \n3.1 \n46.6 \n2.1 \n\n  \n32.9 \n3.0 \n49.0 \n2.0 \n\n  \n82.0 \n1.2 \n455.2 \n0.2 \n\n  \n87.0 \n1.1 \n668.8 \n0.1 \n\n  \n79.7 \n1.3 \n392.5 \n0.3 \n\nSwitching Values \nDecrease in benefits (percent) \nSensitivity Index \nIncrease in costs (percent) \nSensitivity Index \nSimultaneous \npercentage \nSensitivity Analysis \n  \n24.4 \n10 % decrease in benefits \n22.1 \n20 % decrease in benefits \n19.6 \n30 % decrease in benefits \n17.1 \n40 % decrease in benefits \n14.4 \n50 % decrease in benefits \n24.6 \n10 % increase in costs \n22.8 \n20 % increase in costs \n21.3 \n30 % increase in costs \n20.0 \n40 % increase in costs \n18.8 \n50 % increase in costs \nDWS&S = Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PIR = \npoverty impact ratio, SI = sensitivity index.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n  \n51.8  \n47.8  \n43.7  \n39.3  \n34.7  \n52.1  \n49.1  \n46.5  \n44.3  \n42.2  \n\n  \n38.2 \n35.2 \n32.1 \n28.8 \n25.3 \n38.5  \n36.2  \n34.3  \n32.6  \n31.0  \n\n  \n45.3 \n41.8  \n38.2 \n34.4 \n30.2 \n45.6 \n43.0 \n40.7 \n38.7 \n36.9 \n\n  \n15.9 \n14.2 \n12.5 \n10.7 \n8.6 \n16.0 \n14.8 \n13.7 \n12.8 \n11.9 \n\n  \n41.7 \n38.5 \n35.1 \n31.5 \n27.7 \n42.0 \n39.6 \n37.4 \n35.6 \n33.9 \n\n  \n11.2 \n10.4 \n9.6 \n8.6 \n7.4 \n11.2 \n0.8 \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n39.8 \n35.5 \n31.2 \n26.8 \n22.3 \n40.1 \n36.9 \n34.2 \n31.8 \n29.7 \n\n  \n16.5 \n14.5 \n12.4 \n10.2 \n7.8 \n16.7 \n15.2 \n13.9 \n12.7 \n11.7 \n\n  \n15.2 \n12.0 \n8.7 \n5.5 \n2.2 \n17.1 \n15.7 \n14.3 \n12.9 \n11.4 \n\n  \n71.4 \n1.4 \n250.1 \n0.4 \n\n  \n73.6 \n  \n279.2 \n  \n\n  \n58.1 \n1.7 \n138.6 \n0.7 \n\n69.5 \n\n19.7 \n\n72.7 \n\n40.9 \n\n58.3 \n\n18.9 \n\n55.6 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n49 \n\nGENDER STRATEGY AND PLAN \n\n \n1. \nWomen  in  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas  (FATA)  play  a  dominant  role  in \nrunning  the  household,  rearing  and  guiding  children,  managing  household  finances,  and \nproviding much of the labor for agriculture and animal husbandry. They do not normally have a \npublic  role,  particularly  in  interactions  with  the  broader  society.  The  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments  recognize  the  importance  of  addressing  poverty,  especially  as  it  affects  women. \nWomen\u2019s inclusion in project activities and surveys from the earliest days and early discussion \nwith community elders over including them in project benefits will assist communities to focus on \nproblems  that  especially  affect  women,  such  as  water  availability  and  small-scale  income \ngeneration. Too overt a focus on women\u2019s programs and women\u2019s issues can generate hostility \nwithin communities where elders perceive proposed gender programs as a potential corrupting \nthreat to the local social and cultural fabric. In the event such a problem arises, it could lead to \nrejection of all project activities until community confidence revives. The threat will be highest at \nthe early stages of implementation, but experience in other conservative areas of Pakistan, like \nDir  district,  demonstrates  that  a  patient  and  considered  approach  does  result  in  increased \neconomic activity by women.  \n \n2. \nGender inequality and discrimination is a common experience of women in FATA, as is \ntrue  for  other  areas  of  Pakistan.  Gender-related  indicators  show  that  the  social,  legal,  and \npolitical  status  of  women  is  lower  than  in  the  rest  of  the  country.  As  compared  with  the  31% \nfemale literacy rate in Pakistan, the rate in FATA is only 3%. In many places it is 0%. According \nto  the  second  phase  of  the  midterm  review  of  performance  indicators  for  the  Social  Action \nProgramme, 1991\u20131999, the gross mid level enrolment rate in FATA is only 15 % and for girls it \nis only 2%. The same report states that girls make up only 5% of total middle school enrolments \nin FATA. Only 5% of pregnant women had a prenatal consultation, and qualified staff attended \n8% of births. The utilization rate of basic health units and mother and child health centers, and \nuse of contraceptives remain minimal. As compared with 77% of the population in Pakistan with \naccess to clean water, in FATA only 16% have such access.  \n \n3. \nThe Government strategy to improve the status of women in FATA is to invest primarily \nin education and health. In the 2004\u20132005 Annual Development Plan for FATA, the Government \nhas considerably increased investment in these sectors and taken special measures to improve \nworking  conditions  of  women  staff  in  the  health  and  education  sectors.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment  focus,  the  Project  includes  considerable  investment  in  the  drinking  water  sector \nand  proactive  gender-specific  measures \ninstitutional \narrangements in green sectors as well. To ensure women\u2019s access to services provided under \nthe  Project,  gender  mainstreaming  will  be  the  key  strategy  to  integrate  gender  equality \nperspectives  into  all  project  components,  implementation  arrangements,  consulting  services, \nand the loan agreement. The strategy will be implemented through the key actions and targets \npresented in Table A14. \n\nto  align  resource  allocation  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A14: Components and Targets for Gender Strategy \n \n\nActions and Targets  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\u2022  Engendering planning and resource allocation processes by allocating 33% \ngender-specific targets in annual work plans for components involving direct \nbenefits to women \n\n\u2022  Proactive efforts to ensure participation of women in project activities, \n\nparticularly of vulnerable women and widows \n\n\u2022  Gender-disaggregated progress reporting across the project sectors and \n\ncomponents to monitor gender equality in project results and achievements \n\u2022  Advocacy campaigns for promoting gender and development objectives of the \n\nProject  \n\n\u2022  Placement of gender specialists in the PMU and PIUs to mainstream a gender \n\nequality perspective in all project activities, particularly support for line agencies \nin gender planning, implementation, and monitoring: \none senior gender adviser in the PMU; and  \none gender specialist in each PIU  \n\n\u2022  Placement of female technical staff in line agencies and provision of professional \n\ntraining for them from recognized training institutes to ensure service delivery to \nrural beneficiaries.

Overall, about 50% of the national labor force is employed in agriculture and its related fields. In the \nfederally administered tribal areas (FATA), about 95% of the farms are less than 5 hectares (12 acres), encompassing \nabout  57%  of  the  area.  Farmers  operating  1  hectare  or  less  (2.5  acres)  make  up  about  57%  of  all  farms  and  own \nabout 34% of the farm area. The average farm size is about 0.9 hectare. About 99, 95, and 56% of the farm area is \ncultivated  in  Bajaur,  Khyber,  and  Mohmand  agencies,  respectively.  The  cultivated  area  in  Khyber  Agency  is  low, \nmainly due to rain-fed conditions as only 4.2% of the farm area is irrigated. About 20% of the farm area is irrigated in \nBajaur  Agency,  the  highest  in  the  project  area.  The  small  landholdings  inhibit  farmers  from  investing  in  modern \ntechniques,  hence,  the  productivity  levels  are  low  and  a  great  potential  exists  for  increasing  farm  incomes  in  the \nproject area. The natural resource base of Bajaur and Mohmand agencies is not only large but also diverse, creating \nopportunities for residents to generate high incomes from regular cash crops and off-season vegetables. On the other \nhand,  Khyber  Agency  is  predominately  rain-fed,  therefore,  residents  rely  more  on  business  and  employment. \nFurthermore  the  agency  is  close  to  Peshawar,  the  urban  center  and  capital  of  North-West  Frontier  Province,  and \npeople have more opportunities in employment and business. The bulk of the goods traded under the Afghan Transit \nTrade Agreement, means goods for Afghanistan are smuggled back to Peshawar and the rest of the country through \nKhyber Agency, creating employment opportunities.  \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                 Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe  official  Pakistan  poverty  threshold  level  is  PRs774a  per  capita.  Rural  poverty  is  estimated  as  38.7%,  which  is \nconsiderably high than urban areas (22.4%). The decrease in poverty for 2003 resulted from macroeconomic stability \nand a near elimination of external account vulnerability resulting in a growth rate of 5.1% in 2003 as compared  with \n3.4% in 2002 and 2.2% in 2001.  \n \nThe project agencies of Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand are the poorest in the FATA. A detailed socioeconomic study \nof the project area (Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand agencies) was carried out during the project preparatory technical \nassistance to understand the realities and provide a basis for plans and designs for the Project. The socioeconomic \nand  poverty  assessment  is  based  on  (i)  review  of  secondary  data,  (ii)  household  surveys,  (iii)  participatory  poverty \nassessment, and (iv) needs assessment. Secondary information is available on demography, health, educational, and \nphysical infrastructure facilities; farm and cultivated area; and farm size and ownership distribution. Household surveys \nwere designed to collect household-specific information, such as (i) composition of the farm family; (ii) land ownership \nand tenure; cropping pattern; and yields of major crops, fruits, and vegetables; (iii) cultural practices and input use and \ntheir prices; (iv) enterprise  budgets for crops and livestock; (v) access to  services  like  agricultural  extension, health, \neducational facilities, and credit; (vi) off-farm income; (vii) household expenditure pattern; (viii) perceptions regarding \nthe  constraints  and  opportunities  in  increasing  crop  and  livestock  productivity;  (ix)  type  and  nature  of  sanitation \nconditions;  and  (x)  economic  activities  by  women.  In  each  household  both  male  and  female  respondents  from  each \nfamily were interviewed. \n \nAbout 60% of FATA's population is poor, with levels of over 80% in some villages, based on household income, self- \nassessments, observation of degraded natural resources, access and use rights, availability and access to services, \nand  basic  infrastructure.  This  estimate  almost  certainly  understates  real  poverty  in  the  more  isolated  communities. \nUsing  information  from  participatory  self-evaluations,  even  the  better-off  members  in  communities  are  barely  above \nthe  Government's  poverty  threshold.  The  region  has  an  aggregate  literacy  rate  of  just  over  17%\u2014only  3%  for \nfemales\u2014with an estimated primary school participation rate of 41%, well below the national averages of 45% literacy \nand 77% participation. A mere 54% of the population has access to clean drinking water, as compared with 75% for \nthe settled districts of neighboring North-West Frontier Province. \n \nFactors  underlying  poverty  in  FATA  include  (i)  historical  political  and  social  isolation;  (ii)  a  legal  system  reliant  on \n\n \n\nA. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nexecutive  and  judicial  authority  administered  through  civil  servants  preferring  to  maintain  the  status  quo;  (iii)  poor \nquality  and  coverage  of  institutions  responsible  for  the  provision  of  basic  services  such  as  health,  education, \ncommunications,  and  productive  enterprises;  (iv)  social  practices  that  preclude  participation  in  economic  life  by \nwomen; and (v) lack of effective institutions for skill training to enable the labor force to shift from low productivity to \nhigh productivity sectors. Agricultural skills are poor with low productivity; natural resource management is inadequate \nwith  increasingly  degraded  lands.  Few  alternative  employment  opportunities  are  available  outside  of  agriculture. \nAttitudes  within the tribal areas coincide  with increasing government support for greater participatory involvement by \nthe poor. Radical changes in representative government may occur within the next few years, which provide expanded \nopportunity for the poor to seek improved livelihoods through participation in community planning, greater engagement \nwith government service providers, training, and credit use. Currently, contact between government service providers \nand communities are inadequate, and constrained by lack of resources and relevant programs. \n \nFor most people, the environment is harsh, with few resources not already allocated. Economic growth and economic \nopportunities  are  few.  Water  scarcity  is  an  overarching  constraint.  A  large  number  of  people  face  great  hardship  in \ncollecting water from remote areas. Some communities are using donkey carts and tractor tankers for bringing water \nfrom  remote  sources.  In  other  cases,  women  and  children  are  responsible  for  collection  of  water  from  springs, \ncommunal taps, or dug well usually located at a distance from the community. Scattered evidence from some parts of \nthe agencies suggests that rural households spend between $0.5 (PRs30) to $1.5 (PRs100) on a daily basis to ensure \nwater supplies for domestic consumption. Likewise, in the irrigation subsector, the scarcity of both ground and surface \nwater  combined  with  power  shortages  remain  the  biggest  constraint  to  development  of  irrigation.  Low  awareness \nabout  rainwater  harvesting  and  its  limited  promotion  by  the  technical  line  agencies  is  another  factor,  which  has \nprevented a meaningful utilization of the single biggest source of water in the project areas. \n \nLarge  areas  in  the  three  tribal  agencies  are  still  inaccessible  and  in  desperate  need  of  road  links  to  recently \nconstructed  arterial  roads,  and  to  open  up  the  economic  potential  and  improve  access  to  social  services.  The  long \nyears  of  neglect  and  financial  stringency  have  caused  deterioration  of  the  existing  road  network  with  direct \nconsequences  for  the  local  economy  and  service  provision.  There  is  clearly  an  urgent  need  to  focus  on  the \nconstruction of new roads and tracks in selected areas as well as the upgrading of priority existing roads in all three \nagencies. \n \nTo address this situation, the Project seeks to (i) improve the living conditions of the rural poor, especially women; (ii) \nboost  agricultural  production  and  incomes  of  the  population  living  in  poverty;  (iii)  improve  the  status  of  women  by \ntargeting  them  for  special  attention  in  a  culturally  acceptable  manner,  and  provide  training  and  support  to  income-\ngenerating activities; (iv) improve the resource base by rehabilitating and extending irrigated areas and social forestry; \n(v)  open  the  inaccessible  areas,  and  improve  access  and  marketing  of  the  rural  communities  through  improvement \nand  construction  of  main  and  feeder  roads;  and  (vi)  establish  and  strengthen  community  organizations  as  the \ninstitutions through which technical and social services can be provided to target groups on a sustainable basis. \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n  Yes \n\n   Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   No \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nGender and Development \n\nD. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen  are  the  most  disadvantaged  group  in  FATA,  with  few  economic  resources  and  low  social  status.  Female \nliteracy is a 3%; overall, male literacy is scarcely above 17%, well below the norm for Pakistan. Women\u2019s mobility and \nparticipation in mainstream development activities is traditionally restricted by the dominant patriarchal tribal system. \nThe  Project  has  prepared  a  gender  action  plan  for  enabling  them  to  participate  in  the  Project\u2019s  mainstream \ndevelopment activities. The process must be guided by social traditions; over time,  women are expected to improve \ntheir social, economic, and political standing in society.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    Yes  \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n53 \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nResettlement \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nLabor \n\nAffordability \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risksb \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nProject  activities  are  unlikely  to  bring  about  significant \nresettlement.

The  people  of \nFATA are part of Pakistan\u2019s mainstream social, cultural, and \neconomic  systems.  They  are  not  culturally  secluded  tribes, \nwho may be adversely affected by the Project.  \n\nfollow \n\nImplementation  depends  on  community  commitment \nto \nprovide  voluntary  unskilled  labor  and  on  adequate  technical \nskills  available  in  local  markets.

The  program  only  covers  those  subprojects  that  are  the \nresponsibility of the direct beneficiaries; such as drinking water tubewells or shallow dug wells, \nsmall irrigation schemes and ponds, and other such subprojects. \n \nThe Government will be responsible for O&M of subprojects under their control; such as \n3. \nroads,  storage  dams,  or  other  larger  subprojects  that  are  too  large  to  be  managed  by  the \nbeneficiaries. \n \n4. \nfollowing: \n \n\nADB proposes to assist in financing O&M for the turned over subprojects based on the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nDuring  development  of  the  design  and  cost  estimates  of  each  subproject,  a \ndetailed annual estimate will be made of the operation (such as for the purchase \nof  diesel  fuel)  and  maintenance  costs  (such  as  repairs  of  pumps,  gates,  etc.). \nOther minor costs such as desiltation of canals, repair of bunds, etc. will remain \nthe responsibility of the beneficiaries without pay. A revised cost estimate will be \nmade  for  each  subproject  on  an  annual  basis  based  on  lessons  learned  the \nprevious year.  \n\nThe  beneficiaries  and  executing  agencies  line  departments  at  the  agency  level \nwill  establish  a  jointly  operated  savings  account  in  the  names  of  responsible \nparties from the village organization and executing agency concerned. The three \nagencies gave assurance that this could be done. On an annual basis, funds will \nbe directly deposited into the joint savings account through the Project\u2019s imprest \naccount  and  from  the  beneficiaries  based  on  Table  A16.  Operating  procedures \nwill be established by the project management unit during implementation by the \ntwo  parties  and  adjusted  as  required  during  implementation.  The  project \nimplementation  unit  will  maintain  accounting  and  transparent  records  for  all \nwithdrawals from the account and receipts of purchases/repairs that are made for \nthe facility. \n\nThe percentage of financing would be based on the schedule in Table A16. \n\nTable A16: Percentage of Financing \n\nYear Following Completion of Construction \n\nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nYear 3 \nYear 4 \nYear 5 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n% of Financing \n\nADB \n100 \n75 \n50 \n25 \n0 \n\nBeneficiaries \n0 \n25 \n50 \n75 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit\n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 21 March 2006) \n", "PRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "$.0165 \nPRs60.58 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nEA \nEIRR \nENPV \nFATA \nIA \nICM \nLARC \nM&E \nMIS \nNWFP \nO&M \nPIU \nPMU \nPPMS \nPRB \nPSC \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \neconomic net present value  \nFederally Administered Tribal Areas \nimplementing agency \nintegrated crop management \nland acquisition and resettlement cell  \nmonitoring and evaluation \nmanagement information system \nNorth-West Frontier Province \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementation unit \nproject management unit \nproject performance management system  \nproject review board \nproject steering committee \ntechnical assistance  \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \nVice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", " \nL.
