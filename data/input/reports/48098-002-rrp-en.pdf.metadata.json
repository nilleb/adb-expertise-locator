The report also describes the proposed (i) administration of a grant to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administration of a grant to be provided by the \nHigh-Level  Technology  Fund,1  both for the  Balochistan Water  Resources  Development  Sector \nProject; and (ii) administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by JFPR for Climate-\nResilient Water Resources Management, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants and \nthe TA. \n \nThe proposed project will be implemented in the Zhob and Mula river basins in Balochistan \n2. \nProvince.  The  project  will  improve  (i)  land  and  water  resources  management  and  agricultural \nproductivity and farm income in Balochistan and (ii) the institutional capacity of the Government \nof Balochistan (GOB) to implement its integrated water resources management (IWRM) policy.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nPoverty. Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest province, with a land area of 347,190 square \nkilometers. It is also the poorest. A multidimensional index estimated Balochistan\u2019s poverty rate \nat  about  71.2%  during  2014\u20132015, compared  with  38.8% for  Pakistan  as  a  whole.3  Poverty  in \nBalochistan  is  a  rural  phenomenon.  Limited  water  resources,  lack  of  off-farm  employment \nopportunities,  extreme  weather  conditions,  and  inefficient  and  highly  unequal  use  of  land  and \nwater resources are the main factors contributing to high poverty levels in the province. \n \nAgriculture and water scarcity. Agriculture is the backbone of Balochistan\u2019s economy. \n4. \nAbout  75%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas  and  depends  mainly  on  agriculture.  The \nagriculture sector accounts for about two-thirds of the gross provincial domestic product and about \n60% of the labor force. Because of the province\u2019s arid climate and severe overgrazing, much of \nBalochistan\u2019s land is rugged desert or low-grade rangeland. Only about 2.5 million hectares (ha), \nor about 7.2% of the total land area, are under cultivation, with both kharif (spring) and rabi (winter) \ncrops grown  seasonally  throughout the  year.  Balochistan  is the  least  water-secure  province  in \nPakistan and water, not land, is usually the main factor limiting agricultural productivity and farm \nincome growth. Its water resources comprise groundwater (4%), water share from the Indus Basin \n(39%),  and  floodwater  (57%).  Agriculture  accounts  for  93%  of  total  water  use  in  Balochistan, \nwhere water availability per ha per year averages 560 cubic meters (m3), much lower than the \n2,500  m3  average  in  Pakistan\u2019s  three  other  provinces.  In  Balochistan,  floodwater  has  greater \ndevelopment potential as only 40% is used for irrigation and the rest flows down to the sea.4 \n                                                 \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  GOB,  Department  of  Irrigation  and  Power.  2006.

Appendix 8. Manila). \n\n3  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2016. Multidimensional Poverty in Pakistan. Islamabad. \n4  R. Benmessaoud. 2013. Islamic Republic of Pakistan\u2014Balochistan: Development Issues and Prospects, Part II \u2013 \nWater  and  Agriculture.  Washington,  DC:  World  Bank.  Floodwater  mainly  includes  sailaba  (spate  irrigation)  and \nkhushkaba (rainwater harvesting). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIrrigation. Irrigation plays a vital role in Balochistan\u2019s agriculture. The uncertain and erratic \n5. \nnature of rainfall within a year, and the variations from year to year, cause difficulties in predicting \nrainfall quantity and scheduling irrigation. The perennial irrigation infrastructure has deteriorated \nand  requires  rehabilitation.  The  province  has  an  irrigated  area  of  about  1.09  million  ha,  about \n3.2% of its total land area, of which about half is irrigated with perennial sources and the rest with \ngroundwater.5 In addition, harvested rainfall, runoff, and floodwater diversion techniques are used \nto  cultivate  land,  but  they  are  poorly  managed,  inefficient,  and  unproductive.  These  structures \ncannot manage large flood flows. Permanent headworks that can effectively regulate high flood \nflows or dams that can store and enable the timely release of water for downstream agricultural \npurposes  can  significantly  improve  agricultural  productivity,  enhance  rural  livelihoods,  and \nimprove food security. \n \nWatershed  management.  Balochistan\u2019s  watershed  resources  have  come  under  rising \n6. \npressure  from  anthropogenic  stresses  such  as  uncontrolled  grazing  and  excessive  clearing  of \nland for cultivation. The rapid proliferation of tube wells is lowering the water table in some districts \nas  well.  This  worsening  situation  is  affecting  not  only  the  overall  sustainability  of  watershed \nresources, but also the poor who depend heavily on the resource base for their livelihoods. \n \n7. \nClimate change. Future climate change scenarios project annual mean temperatures to \nincrease by about 4\u00b0C and annual mean precipitation to increase slightly toward the end of the \ncentury in Pakistan, causing more frequent and severe flood and drought events. These changes \nare expected to increase water demand and worsen water security in the province. Pakistan\u2019s \ncapacity to store freshwater is among the lowest in the region, worsening climate change risks to \nthe agricultural economy. The country\u2019s dam storage as a percentage of total renewable water \nresources is 11.3%, slightly lower than India\u2019s (11.7%), but significantly lower than in many other \ncountries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (29.2%)  and  the  United  States  (24.0%).6 \nMeasures  to  adapt  to  potential  climate  changes  include  the  modernization  of  irrigation \ninfrastructure,  expansion  of  water  storage, \ntechnologies, \nimprovement of watersheds, and introduction of drought-resilient crops.7 \n \n8. \nInstitution. Since the approval of the IWRM policy (footnote 2) in 2006, Balochistan has \nmade progress toward effective water resources management, but remains constrained by the \nlack  of  appropriate  national  and  provincial  institutional  frameworks,  coordination  between \nprovincial  institutions,  and  sharing  of  responsibilities  in  the  field.  Lack  of  technical  and  policy \ncapacity within government agencies is also a major concern in IWRM policy implementation. \n \nStrategic fit. The project aligns with the national government\u2019s Vision 2025, which aims \n9. \nto  accelerate  and  sustain  economic  growth  with  a  focus  on  improving  productivity,  to  which \nagriculture is a key contributor.8 The project conforms to the country partnership strategy, 2015\u2013\n2019 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Pakistan, which prioritizes the promotion of better \nwater  resource  management  and  irrigation  to  improve  agricultural  productivity,  increase  farm \nincomes, and ensure food security.9 It also conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u2013\n2020, which aims to increase water use efficiency and promote IWRM.10 \n \n\nintroduction  of  water-saving \n\n                                                 \n5  GOB, Bureau of Statistics. 2015.

ADB,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the World  Bank \n10. \nare  Pakistan\u2019s  major  development  partners  in  agriculture  and  natural  resources.  The  project \ndesign has incorporated these partners\u2019 experiences and lessons in Balochistan and elsewhere \nin  Pakistan.  A  key  lesson  is  to  support  irrigation  command  area  development  along  with \ninvestments  in  water  infrastructure  to  ensure  that  economic  benefits  reach  farmers  and  to \nmotivate beneficiaries to take on operational responsibility. Other key lessons include the need \nfor  (i)  resource  provision  so  that  the  participatory  approach,  including  extensive  community \nmobilization  and  preparation,  can  develop  strong  beneficiary  ownership;  (ii)  up-front  capacity \nbuilding  and  institutional  strengthening  of  government  agencies;  and  (iii)  simplicity  in  project \ndesign and implementation. \n \n11. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project will support IWRM policy implementation \nand  will  support  and  strengthen  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s Water  Policy,11  including  (i)  improving \nwater  use  and  delivery  efficiency;  (ii)  fostering  water  conservation  and  the  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure;  and  (iii)  improving  governance  through  beneficiary  participation  and  capacity \nbuilding.  The  project  will  help  (i)  establish  a  water  resources  information  system  (WRIS)  to \nimprove  water  resources  management  and  monitoring  using  high-level  technology,  such  as \nremote sensing and satellite, for river basin modeling and the identification of degraded lands for \nrehabilitation; and (ii) address watershed degradation by undertaking structural and nonstructural \ninterventions  to  reduce  soil  erosion  in  critical  areas  through  integrated  and  participatory  water \nmanagement  approaches. The  project  will  support  high-value  agriculture,  which  is  essential  to \nimproving farmers\u2019 income in Balochistan. These aspects are an integral part of the project design \nand will help achieve benefits that would not be possible through infrastructure investments alone. \n \nThe  project  design  explicitly  recognizes  the  institutional,  social,  and  cultural  barriers  to \n12. \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and their possible impact on women\u2019s access to and participation in water \nresources development activities; and has incorporated gender-specific interventions. The project \nwill mobilize female social organizers at its field offices to implement the interventions and assess \nthe interventions\u2019 effects on women. \n \n13. \nSector lending. The project will use the sector lending modality to provide flexibility to \nreprioritize and expand interventions during implementation. The GOB\u2019s IWRM policy provides a \ncomprehensive  framework  for  the  province  to  address  water  management  and  development, \nincluding irrigation. The project will finance irrigation development and rehabilitation schemes in \nline  with  the  GOB\u2019s  IWRM  policy  and  irrigation  sector  development  plan.  It  will  include \ndevelopment measures to strengthen the GOB\u2019s irrigation and agriculture departments\u2019 capacity \nto implement the IWRM policy and sector development plan. \n \n14. \nDuring project preparation, the project preparation consultants and the GOB first selected \nthe Zhob and Mula river basins based on the GOB\u2019s priority and water and land availability; and \nthen chose 11 out of more than 300 long-listed subprojects in the two river basins as candidate \nsubprojects for possible ADB financing under the project based on criteria such as water and land \navailability, economic viability, and a balanced approach to extending development support to a \ngeographically wider spread in the selected basins.12 \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003.

The attached TA will help the \n26. \nGOB strengthen the province\u2019s institutional capacity to address exposed climate change impacts \nand  risks  and  to  build  a  climate-resilient  and  sustainable  water  resources  management \nmechanism. The TA will have the following outputs: (i) enhanced knowledge and updated policy \nand  regulatory  frameworks  for  improved  climate-resilient  water  resources  management;  (ii) \nimproved  design  and  functional  infrastructure  of  a  WRIS  applying  satellite  remote-sensing \ntechnology;  and  (iii)  increased  institutional  capacity  and  skills  on  the  efficient  use  of  water  for \nclimate-resilient  water  resources  management.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  and  will  select, \nsupervise, and evaluate the consultants. The Irrigation Department will be the executing agency \nfor the TA.19 \n \n27. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $2,350,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by JFPR and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nThe  GOB,  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  preparation  consultants,  selected  the \ncandidate  subprojects  based  on  a  river  basins  assessment  and  initial  screening.  The  pre-\nfeasibility  studies  for  all  subprojects  and  feasibility  studies  for  the  core  subprojects  were  then \nconducted,  and  detailed  design  will  be  carried  by  project  design  consultants  during  project \nimplementation.  The  technical  feasibility  of  the  project  was  confirmed  to  be  adequate  after \ndetailed  examination  of  local  conditions,  including  current  and  projected  climate  variables, \navailability of water sources, and land available for project facilities. Based on a climate change \nrisk  simulation  using  the  result  of  global  circulation  models,  the  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessment found the project to be highly at risk from the impact of climate change. The project \ndesign  incorporated  adaptation  measures  to  reduce  the  risks  resulting  from  increased  flood \nevents. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nThe project will bring three major benefits to a rural population of about 42,900 people. \nFirst, farm household income is expected to increase because of increased cropping intensities, \nhigher  crop  yields,  and  crop  diversification.  The  analysis  of  three  representative  subprojects \nindicates  that  incremental  household  incomes  will  be  $392\u2013$3,088  per  year  depending  on  the \n                                                 \n19 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffarm\u2019s location in the command area and its current irrigation water supply. Second, incremental \ncrop  labor  will  create  full-time  rural  jobs,  most  of  which  will  go  to  local  workers  from  poor \nhouseholds.  Third,  the  project  will  create  more  economic  opportunities  for  input  suppliers  and \nprocessors of and market intermediaries for agricultural products in the agricultural supply chain. \n \n30. \nThe economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for all three core subprojects are greater \nthan the opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%. The EIRRs are 13.9% for the Siri Toi Dam subproject, \n14.3% for the Kharzan Hatachi subproject, and 24.4% for the Karkh subproject. Economic viability \nwill be one of the criteria for selecting additional subprojects for financing under the loan. These \nrepresentative EIRRs suggest that, overall, the project is economically viable. However, EIRRs \nare highly sensitive to a decrease in and a delay of project benefits. Therefore, it is important that \n(i)  overall  project  and  subproject  implementation  should  be  undertaken  as  scheduled;  and \n(ii) extension  service  support  for  command  area  development,  watershed  management,  and \nkhushkaba  farming  (using  localized  runoff  for  irrigation)  should  be  provided  by  the  project  in \nparallel with the civil works to generate benefits without delay. \n \nThe financial sustainability assessment focused on the operation and maintenance (O&M) \n31. \nrequirements. The annual incremental O&M cost in financial terms for the irrigation systems is \nestimated at PRs118.87 million. To ensure sustainable O&M, the GOB will develop an O&M plan \nfor  the  irrigation  infrastructure  and  WRIS  established  under  the  project.  The  GOB  will  be \nresponsible for the O&M of key irrigation infrastructure and the WRIS. Farmer organizations will \nreceive  training  and  O&M  manuals  to  help  empower  them  to  take  over  the  O&M  of  on-farm \nirrigation  structures,  mainly  by  contributing  their  labor.  Policy  dialogues  with  the  GOB  on \nconducting  irrigation  tariff  reforms  in  Balochistan  will  be  continued  through  the  TA  (para.  27). \nDuring the development of the O&M plan, the Irrigation Department and ADB will reassess and \nreconfirm the adequacy of the O&M requirements. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nA financial management assessment and a procurement risk assessment were conducted \nfor the Irrigation Department as the executing agency and the ACD as the implementing agency \nof  the  project  and  the  grants.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  pre-\nmitigation risk is substantial. Key risks include: (i) financial management staff are not familiar with \nADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  and  procedures;  (ii)  expenditure  incurred  will  not \nfollow the applicable legal framework; and (iii) information systems are lacking, which may result \nin inaccurate and delayed reporting. An action plan was agreed with the Irrigation Department \nand the ACD to address the deficiencies and enhance their financial management. \n \n33. \nThe  procurement  risk  assessment  concluded  that  the  general  environment  for \nprocurement is satisfactory, but the main weaknesses include Irrigation Department and ACD\u2019s \n(i)  inadequate  experience  with  externally  financed  projects,  and  (ii)  unfamiliarity  with  ADB \nprocurement  procedures  and  requirements.  The  GOB  and  ADB  have  prepared  a  capacity \ndevelopment plan, including training and consulting services, for the Irrigation Department and \nthe  ACD  for  improved  financial  management,  procurement,  implementation  capacity,  and \ninstitutional reforms. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n34. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  GOB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n35. \nA  poverty,  social,  and  gender  assessment  was  conducted  by  the  project  preparation \nconsultants  during  project  preparation  and  the  project  has  built  several  measures  for  social \ninclusion and rural residents\u2019 improved living standards, including (i) establishing a command area \nfor  rural  villages  and  the  poor;  (ii)  involving  local  communities  in  project  design  and \nimplementation; and (iii) providing targeted training for local people, especially for the poor and \nwomen. \n \n36. \nExtensive consultations with local communities were conducted during project preparation \nand incorporated their feedback in the project design. Further consultations will be undertaken by \nADB  and  GOB  during  detailed  design  and  implementation  to  ensure  that  local  people  can \nparticipate in and benefit from relevant project activities. \n \n37. \nThe  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  a  gender  action  plan  has \nbeen  prepared.  The  project  will  help  narrow  gaps  in  women\u2019s  limited  representation  in  rural \ncommunities  of  the  project  areas.  Key  gender  actions  and  targets  include:  (i)  30%  of  the \nconsultations during subproject design and construction are with women\u2019s groups; (ii) 30% of the \nsubprojects  have  facilities  for  women\u2019s  increased  access  to  water  for  domestic  use,  such  as \nwashing  facilities  and  water  collection  points;  (iii)  awareness  sessions  are  conducted  on  safe \ndrinking water practices, nutritional value of food, and waterborne diseases for women and girls; \n(iv) 200 women and girls are trained in kitchen gardening skills; (v) at least 250 women are trained \nin income-generating high-value agribusinesses; (vi) at least 22 women-led small-scale income-\ngenerating agribusinesses are launched; and (vii) a social and gender officer is hired at the project \nmanagement office. \n \nE. \n \n38. \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \n39. \nEnvironment (category A). A draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the Siri \nToi  Dam  subproject  and  a  draft  consolidated  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report, \nincluding environmental management plans (EMPs), for the Karkh River Development Schemes \nand the Kharzan Hatachi Infiltration Gallery subprojects were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. An environmental assessment and review framework was prepared to provide \nguidance  for  screening  and  preparing  EIAs  or  IEEs  and  EMPs  for  noncore  subprojects  during \nproject  implementation,  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  policies  and  Pakistan\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations. Stakeholder consultations for the Siri Toi Dam, Karkh River Development Schemes, \nand Kharzan Hatachi Infiltration Gallery subprojects were carried out in May 2017. ADB disclosed \nthe  EIA  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  2  February  2018,  the  IEE  on  13  February  2018,  and  the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework on 7 March 2018. The EIA for the Siri Toi Dam \nsubproject  concluded  that  it  will  bring  mostly  positive  changes  in  the  physical,  biological,  and \nsocioeconomic environments. However, cut-and-fill operations during construction can cause soil \nerosion  and  surface  water  and  air  pollution,  and  the  use  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides  during \noperations can contaminate the groundwater. There is also a risk of breaching of the dam because \nof natural hazards. These risks have been considered and will address them in the detailed project \ndesigns,  which  independent  consultants  will  review  before  construction.  The  Irrigation \nDepartment, with the help of the consultants, will also prepare an emergency response plan for \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards  \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB.

Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in,  and  will  be  implemented \nthrough,  the  EMPs.  The  executing  agency,  the  design  and  supervision  consultants,  and  the \nconstruction contractors will hire dedicated environmental staff during various project phases to \nensure effective implementation of the EMP and other environmental requirements. The Irrigation \nDepartment will also hire a third-party environmental monitoring consultant during the construction \nstage  of  the  Siri  Toi  Dam  subproject  to  carry  out  external  monitoring  of  EMP  implementation. \nADB,  through  the  environmental  staff  and  consultants,  will  also  provide  training  to  the  project \nenvironmental staff on overcoming any deficiency in the effective implementation of the EMP and \nother environmental requirements. \n \n40. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). All 11 subprojects were preliminarily screened \nfor  involuntary  resettlement  at  the  project  preparatory  TA  stage.  Based  on  this  preliminary \nscreening,  only  the  Siri  Toi  Dam  subproject  was  assessed  as  having  involuntary  resettlement \nimpacts. The proposed engineering works for the remaining subprojects involve the rehabilitation \nof existing irrigation infrastructure and are restricted to the existing available rights-of-way. The \nIrrigation  Department  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  Siri  Toi  Dam  subproject  with  the \nassistance of consultants following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. About 311.15 ha of land \nwill be permanently affected, of which 293.53 ha are unsettled land that is considered state land. \nAbout 17.44 ha are settled land belonging to 142 landowners. Land needed for tertiary canals \nand/or watercourses will be determined at a later stage as part of command area development; \nbeneficiaries  will  provide  the  land  for  tertiary  canals  as  their  counterpart  contribution  to  the \nsubproject. The lands to be acquired are mostly barren and have no current economic activity. \nNo  impact  on  crops,  trees,  and  structures  have  been  identified.  Affected  entities  include  142 \nhouseholds  with  plots  on  settled  land  and  two  clans  (Ahmadkhel  Karezai  and  Irabzai)  with \ncustomary claim to land needed for the Siri Toi Dam and the irrigation canals. No household or \nperson  is  expected  to  lose  10%  or  more  of  productive  land  or  be  physically  displaced  from \nhousing. A resettlement framework was prepared to provide guidance for screening and preparing \na resettlement plan for the noncore subprojects with resettlement impacts and unanticipated and \nemerging  impacts  during  project  implementation,  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  policies  and \nPakistan\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Irrigation \nDepartment  and  the  ACD  to  implement the resettlement  plan  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements. \nADB  disclosed  the  resettlement  framework  and  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  on \nADB\u2019s website on 26 February 2018. \n \n41. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  All  11  subprojects  were  preliminarily  screened  for \nindigenous peoples safeguards during project preparation. No indigenous peoples are present in \nthe subproject areas, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project will not affect \nany indigenous communities, so no indigenous peoples planning document is required. \n \nF. \n \n42. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFinancial management staff is not familiar \nwith the financial management \nrequirements and procedures of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \nExpenditure incurred does not comply with \nthe applicable legal framework. \n\nSecurity situation in the project area \ndeteriorates to a level that does not allow \nwork on contracts. \nThe PMO and the PIO are not familiar with \nADB\u2019s procurement requirements and \nprocedures.  \nClimate change may reduce water \navailability for agriculture. \n\nUnsustainable operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of infrastructure components may \noccur because of lack of capacity or \nbudget. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe project will provide training to relevant financial management staff. \nThe project management office (PMO) and the project implementation \noffice (PIO) will recruit financial management consultants to help \nimprove their financial management. \nA comprehensive section in the financial management manual \ndescribes stepwise guidance on expenditure management, defining the \nservice standards and prerequisite supporting documentation for \npayment processing. \nThe Government of Balochistan (GOB) and local governments will \nprovide protection measures to ensure the security of project \ncontractors and consultants during project implementation.  \nThe project will provide training to relevant staff and will recruit \nprocurement consultants to assist the PMO and the PIO in conducting \nprocurement and contract management.  \nThe project design is geared toward climate resilience. Each \ncomponent incorporates adaptation measures such as watershed \nprotection, water storage structure, groundwater recharge, and use of \nwater-saving irrigation technologies. \nThe GOB is committed to developing an O&M plan and allocating an \nadequate budget for O&M, as covenanted in the loan and project \nagreements. The project will also help empower farmer communities, \nby providing training and O&M manuals, to take over the O&M of small \nirrigation facilities and on-farm irrigation management. Policy dialogues \nwith the GOB will be continued for adopting irrigation tariff reforms.  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n43. \nThe Government of Pakistan and the GOB have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n44. \nThe Government of Pakistan and the GOB have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement,  grant  agreements,  and  project \nagreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n45. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Balochistan  Water  Resources \nDevelopment Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of \n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n2 August 2018 \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n\nIncreased farm income in Balochistan (Balochistan Development Vision and Strategy)a \n\nImproved water resources management in Balochistan (Integrated Water Resources Management Policy Balochistan)b \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets and \nBaselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \na\u2013b.
