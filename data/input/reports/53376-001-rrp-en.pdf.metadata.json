Based  on \ncompetitive bidding, the NHAI awarded DBLAAHPL the build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession, \nwhich follows the hybrid annuity model (HAM). The project will decongest a critical connectivity \ncorridor  from  the  hinterland  to  the  port  of  Vishakhapatnam  on  the  east  coast,  increase  traffic \nvolumes  and  vehicular  speeds,  and  reduce  logistics  costs.  The  assistance  is  the  first  private \nsector road project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in South Asia. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \n3. \nProject identification. India has one of the largest road networks in the world, consisting \nof (i) national highways; (ii) state highways; (iii) major district roads; and (iv) rural roads, including \ndistrict and village roads. The 132,500 km of national highways represent about 2% of the entire \nroad network but carry 40% of total road traffic. About 77% of the national highway network was \ntwo-lane or less as of 31 March 2017.1 The low capacity of highways is aggravated by diverse \ntraffic, road encroachments, and poor-quality road surfaces. The capacity and quality of the road \nnetwork have not kept pace with the growth in registered vehicles. While road network capacity \nexpanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.2% in FY1951\u2013FY2017 (footnote 1), \nthe number of vehicles increased by a CAGR of over 10.7%.2 Due to an increase in number of \nvehicles and lack of enforcement of road safety measures, India witnessed the highest number \nof  fatal  road  accidents  in  the  world  in  2019.  Andhra  Pradesh  ranked  seventh  on  this  account \nacross all the states in India in 2019.3 \n \nThe  project  is  under  Bharatmala  Pariyojana,  a  Government  of  India  project  which \n4. \nenvisages  constructing  66,100  km  of  economic  corridors,  coastal  roads,  and  expressways  to \nboost the highway network. Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to increase vehicular speed by 20%\u2013\n25% and reduce supply chain costs by 5%\u20136% by providing at least four-lane connectivity to 550 \ndistricts. The approved outlay for phase 1 is $73 billion, which includes upgrading 34,800 km of \nroad  network  by  FY2022.4 The  NHAI  has  awarded  projects  with  an  aggregate  length  of  about \n6,400 km under Bharatmala Pariyojana, and is preparing detailed project reports for about 25,000 \nkm. The HAM is the NHAI\u2019s preferred mode of concession award. Since April 2015, the NHAI has \nawarded private developers about 7,640 km of HAM projects, 15% of which are operational, 81% \nof  which  are  under  implementation,  and  4%  of  which  have  been  terminated  because  of  land \nacquisition issues. \n \n5. \n \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n \n\n1  Government  of India, Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways.  2017.

The  project  comprises  the  Anandapuram\u2013Anakapalli  section  of  NH-5, \nwhich connects Vishakhapatnam port to the Andhra Pradesh hinterland. The two-lane highway \nwill be expanded to six lanes leading to significant improvement in road connectivity to the port \n(the fourth largest in India and second largest on the east coast). The heavy traffic passing through \nVishakhapatnam  city  on  the  Kolkata-Chennai  corridor  will  be  diverted  to  the  project,  thereby \ndecongesting the city. Climate risk screening was undertaken and climate change impact on the \nproject was assessed to be medium risk. The proposed infrastructure potentially faces flooding \nrisks  due  to  increase  in  heavy  rainfall  and  storm  surges  caused  by  climate  change.  This  has \nimpact  on the  drainage system,  which need  to  be adequately  sized to cope  with higher  runoff \nvolumes  to  reduce  flood  risk.  The  project  design  also  ensures  road  safety  and  is  expected  to \nprevent accidents, through a highway traffic management system, cautionary and/or warning road \nsigns, and road safety devices such as object hazard markers, pedestrian facilities, and roadside \nsafety barriers. \n \n7. \n \n8. \nThe NHAI  was set  up  by  the  NHAI  Act,  1988  and  operates  under the Ministry  of  Road \nTransport and Highways, and has several funding sources, including budgetary allocation from \nIndia\u2019s consolidated budget, levy on the sale of diesel and petrol, toll revenues from operating \nroads,  and  revenue  share  from  public\u2013private  partnership  projects.  The  NHAI  is  rated \ninternationally  Baa3/negative  (same  as  India\u2019s  sovereign  rating)  by  Moody\u2019s,  and  domestically \nAAA by CRISIL and ICRA Limited. \n \n9. \n \n10. \n \nBorrower and Sponsor. ADB\u2019s loan will be provided to DBLAAHPL, a special purpose \n11. \nvehicle incorporated by DBL to implement the project. DBL is a leading highway developer and \ncontractor headquartered  in  Bhopal,  Madhya  Pradesh.  DBL has more than 38,000  employees \nand  owns  one  of the  largest  fleets  of  construction equipment  in India.  Dilip  Suryavanshi  is  the \nchairperson and managing director of DBL and owns 40.3% of its shares. Devendra Jain is the \nexecutive director and chief executive officer of DBL and owns 26.0%. Seema Suryavanshi, the \nspouse of Dilip Suryavanshi, is the executive director and owns 8.7%. DBL is listed on the Bombay \nStock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India, and 25% of its shares are held by \ninstitutional shareholders and the public. DBL is rated domestically A/stable by CRISIL (reaffirmed \non 2 July 2020),5 and its market capitalization was $644.5 million as of 10 November 2020.6 \n \n12. \nDBL has strong execution capability, with a fully integrated business model and in-house \ncapability to manufacture inputs used in road and highway construction.

The  project  impact  is  aligned  with  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  Bharatmala \nPariyojana,  which  targets  construction  of  new  roads  and  upgrading  of  the  road  network, \naggregating 66,100 km. The project will also serve as a bypass road which will help reduce traffic \nvolume passing through Vishakhapatnam city. Being a part of Bharatmala Pariyojana, the project \nwill also provide enhanced connectivity from the hinterland to the port of Vishakhapatnam, thereby \nleading to faster, safer, and more reliable cargo traffic flow which ultimately will facilitate regional \nand international trade.7 \n \n16. \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: road connectivity improved. It will \nincrease road traffic volume, boost local employment, and contribute to the local economy through \nincreased government revenues and domestic purchases. \n \n17. \nOutputs.  The  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  road  expanded  and  growth  of  local  economy \nsupported;  (ii)  local  jobs  created  and  gender  equality  improved;  and  (iii)  sexual  exploitation, \nabuse, and harassment prevention strengthened. \n \n\n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \n18. \nthe  ADB  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  making  cities  more  livable,  tackling  remaining \npoverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  and  accelerating  progress  in  gender \nequality.8 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, \nspecifically pillar 2: providing inclusive access to infrastructure networks and social services by \nimproving  the  infrastructure  bottlenecks  in  lagging  regions. 9 The  project  is  connected  to  the \nsection of the East Coast Economic Corridor which is being supported by ADB in India.10 \n \n19. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  the  following  elements  of  the  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  of  the  Transport \nSector  Group:  scaling  up  urban  transport,  improving  cross-border  transport  and  logistics,  and \nsupporting road safety and social sustainability.11 \n \n20. \nLessons from previous operations. There has been limited nonsovereign debt financing \nby  ADB  for  the  road  subsector  in  India.  Key  lessons  learnt  from  sovereign  road  construction \nprojects in India are (i) managing cost over-runs, (ii) having realistic execution timeframes, and \n(iii)  having  long-term  maintenance  planning. 12  The  project\u2019s  implementation  arrangements \nincorporate these lessons and ADB, as a key senior lender, will closely monitor these aspects. \n \n\n \n\n \n21. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n \n\n7  Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2017.

The project is ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign \nroad project in India and will help highlight to international lenders the strength of the contractual \nstructure under the HAM for road construction. ADB's engagement will add value by ensuring that \nthe  project  will  implement  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  thereby  adopting \ninternationally  recognized  environmental  and  social  (E&S)  standards,  including  (i)  installing \nbarriers  to  minimize  noise  impacts  in  certain  project  sections,  (ii)  minimizing  potential  risks  to \nwildlife  in  vulnerable  parts  of  the  project,  and (iii)  adequately  compensating  non-titleholders  of \nacquired land. These measures are not required by domestic laws. ADB\u2019s involvement will ensure \nimplementation of gender-inclusive measures such as (i) targets for women\u2019s employment during \noperations; (ii) provision of female technical or engineering internships; and (iii) development of a \nzero-tolerance policy against sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment.  \n \n\nRisks \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n \n4 \n\n \n22. \n \n\n \n23. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n24. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n27. \n \n \n28. \n \n \n29. \n \n \n30. \n \n \n31. \n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n32. \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  A), \nand indigenous people (category C).13 \n \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the project\u2019s potential E&S impacts, and \n33. \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  adverse  impacts  in  the  safeguard \nreports  and  plans.  Independent  and  qualified  consultants  have  prepared  an  E&S  compliance \naudit, a detailed initial environmental examination, and a social compliance audit (SCA) report. \nThe E&S measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of DBLAAHPL to manage the \nproject\u2019s E&S impacts are deemed adequate. Institutional capacity will be further strengthened to \nensure that management systems and resources are in place to implement the agreed actions \nand ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n34. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  Key  construction  environmental  impacts  and  risks  include \nnoise  and  vibration,  dust,  potential  damage  to  cultural  heritage  assets,  danger  to  health  and \nsafety, deterioration of surface water bodies, increased traffic, and solid and liquid waste. During \noperations, key environmental impacts will include noise, traffic emissions, and public safety risks. \n \n35. \nEnvironment,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  risks  during  construction  are  being  managed \nthrough  the  project\u2019s  construction  EHS  management  plans.  They  include  standard  mitigation \nmeasures for the anticipated construction EHS impacts, including the use of temporary retractable \nnoise barriers. Based on the findings of ADB\u2019s due diligence assessment, the management plans \nwill be strengthened to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n36. \n \n37. \nNo internationally recognized biodiversity area is within or near the project site or study \narea.  The  nearest  legally  protected  area  is  the  nationally  designated  Kambalakonda  Wildlife \nSanctuary. The project site and the wildlife sanctuary or its buffer zone do not overlap. A section \nof the protected area, however, is adjacent to the road to be expanded. DBLAAHPL will liaise with \nthe local Forest Department to implement mitigation measures consistent with those detailed in \nthe  department\u2019s  Wildlife  Management  Plan  for  the  sanctuary,  which  will  minimize  the  risk  of \nwildlife colliding with motor vehicles. \n \n38. \nSome community property resources on government and private land, including temples, \nstatues, and memorials, are within the project\u2019s right of way (ROW). The structures have been \nmoved  or  are  being  moved  in  consultation  and  agreement  with  stakeholders,  including  local \ncommunities. Progress in moving community property and the outcomes of public consultations \nwill be included in the monitoring and progress reports to be submitted periodically to ADB. \n \n39. \n \n40. \nAn  independent  consultant  undertook  an  SCA  to  identify  any  past  or  present  concerns \nrelated  to  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples,  assess  compliance  with  statutory \nrequirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and provide mitigating measures.

Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n6 \n\n \n\nincluded  (i)  examination  of  land  and  asset  valuation  and  compensation  with  respect  to \nreplacement value, (ii) a census survey of all project-affected persons (PAPs) residing in the ROW \nand their reasons for doing so, (iii) a vulnerability assessment linked to PAPs\u2019 loss of land and/or \nlivelihood, and (iv) independent market valuation of existing immovable assets. Considering the \nassessment  and  other  factors,  the  consultant  has  evaluated  the  project\u2019s  compliance  with \nstatutory requirements; alignment with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and actions required \nto close the identified gaps (including time-bound actions, budget, and resource requirements). \nThe SCA reflects the results of ongoing engagement with affected families and communities on \nland acquisition and provides a road map for further consultations and grievance management. \n \n41. \nThe SCA found that (i) land and asset compensation for titleholder families was higher \nthan  the  market  value  of  the  affected  land  and/or  asset;  (ii)  the  informal  settlers  and  non-\ntitleholders were considered for asset compensation (although some gaps have been identified \nwith respect to replacement value, which will be tackled); (iii) PAPs are well aware of the  land \nacquisition process and satisfied with its outcome; (iv) the company has proactively engaged with \nthe PAPs and expedited resolution of grievances; and (v) livelihood restoration measures will help \nvulnerable PAPs cope with land and/or asset loss. Confidential information redacted). \n \n42. \nThe SCA found no material or expected degradation or adverse impact on or additional \nvulnerabilities associated with land and natural resources on which indigenous peoples depend. \n \n43. \nEffective  gender mainstreaming. Women  hold just  1.4%  of technical  and managerial \nroles in construction.14 As of September 2020, DBL had employed 900 staff members on behalf \nof DBLAAHPL, all of whom were contractors involved in road construction and 56 (6%) of whom \nwere women. The construction environment can put community members, workers, and service \nusers  at  high  risk  of  gender-based  violence  and  harassment. 15  DBL  does  not  have  a \ncomprehensive policy against sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment that encompasses all \ntypes of workers, service users, and community members. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender  and  Development  (1998),  DBLAAHPL  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender \nequality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action \nplan  are  (i)  targets  for  women\u2019s  employment  during  operations  and  construction;  (ii)  hiring  of \nfemale ambulance paramedics; (iii) provision of female technical or engineering internships; (iv) \ndevelopment of a zero-tolerance policy against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment; and \n(v) staff training on the policy against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment. DBLAAHPL will \nsubmit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nDBLAAHPL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \n44. \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.16 DBLAAHPL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with \nsuch laws and (ii) measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with PAPs will follow \nADB requirements.17 \n \n\n9 February. \n\n \n\n14 S. Choudhari. 2019.
