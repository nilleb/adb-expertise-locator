The  Project \nwill  build  on  the  work  done  under  other  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)-funded  projects  such  as  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram  (ESDP),  the  Information  and  Communications  Technology  in \nBasic  Education  Project \nthe  Second  Textbook \nDevelopment  Project  (STDP).  The  Project  has  three  components:  (i) \nschool  upgrading,  (ii)  teacher  development,  and  (iii)  the  promotion  of \ncommunity participation in school life. \n \nThe  justification  for  funding  basic  education  in  rural  areas  rests  on \ncurrent disparities in the provision of quality education services. Across \nthe  country,  schools  in  rural  communities  that  are  remote  from \nprovincial  and  district  centers  are  disadvantaged  in  almost  every \nrespect.  A  comprehensive  school  survey  conducted  in  2004  revealed \nclear  disparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools  in  terms  of  (i) \nfacilities; (ii) the allocation and quality of materials, teaching equipment, \nand furniture; and (iii) the allotment of teachers. \n \nAbout  80%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  9,773  basic  schools  are  located  in  rural \nareas. The vast majority of rural basic schools are considered to be in \npoor  condition,  requiring  emergency  repairs  and  major  rehabilitation \nworks.  Common  defects  include  leaking  roofs,  water  infiltration  to  the \nbuilding  structures,  damaged  windows  and  doors,  defective  floors, \nmalfunctioning sanitary and plumbing facilities, broken heating systems, \nand  leaking  water  supply  systems.  Most  classroom  furniture  is  also  in \nvery poor condition. About 70% of schools have no science laboratory \nequipment and lack modern teaching aids and learning materials.  \n \nTeaching  techniques  and  subject  knowledge  of  many  teachers, \nparticularly  in  rural  schools,  are  inadequate  and  outdated.  Most \nteachers  still  apply  traditional  teaching  methods,  devoting  attention \ngenerally to narrow subject knowledge, requiring students to memorize \nand  repeat  notions  and  definitions.  Critical  thinking,  problem  solving, \ncommunication skills, and teamwork do not receive sufficient attention. \nAlthough  training  programs  for  teachers  have  been  gradually  revised, \nthe current in-service training system needs to become more flexible to \n\n\fadjust  to  specific  subject-related  requirements  of  teachers  in  rural \nschools, who work in difficult circumstances. \n\nin \n\nto \n\nin  addressing \n\nissues  related \n\nthe  2004  survey, \n\nthe  needs  highlighted \n\ninclude  school  construction  and \n\nResponding \nthe \nGovernment  launched  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education \nDevelopment  (NPBED)  2004\u20132009,  which  aims  to  strengthen  basic \neducation to meet international standards and remove disparities. The \ninvestment  costs  of  the  NPBED  are  estimated  at  $1.2  billion,  to  be \nfinanced  by  a  combination  of  75%  budget  financing,  20%  foreign \ninvestment  financing,  and  5%  local  voluntary  contributions.  Major \ninvestments \nrehabilitation,  and \nsignificant  salary  increases  for  teachers  in  order  to  provide  them  with \nadequate incentives. \n \nThe Government has asked ADB\u2019s support to supplement the NPBED \nand focus on improving the relevance and quality of basic education in \nrural areas in selected regions. Other ongoing ADB interventions in the \neducation  sector  provide  country-wide  assistance,  under  the  NPBED \nframework, \nto  (i)  policy  planning, \ngovernance,  and  management;  (ii)  curriculum  modernization  and \ntextbook development; and (iii) improving teaching and learning through \ninformation and communication technology. \n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  education  sector  in  Uzbekistan  has  evolved \nsince  the  mid-1990s  to  support  the  Government  in  different  stages  of \nreforming and strengthening the education system. Assistance included \nthe ongoing ESDP that was approved in December 2002 and consists \nof  a  program  loan  for  $70  million  and  a  project  loan  for  $38.5  million. \nThe  ESDP  assisted  in  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  policy \nreform  framework  with  special  focus  on  (i)  modernizing  the  structure, \ncontent,  and  process  of  education;  (ii)  improving  sector  sustainability \nand  efficiency;  (iii)  reforming  governance  of  education;  and  (iv) \nproviding protection to the most vulnerable students. The STDP builds \non  the  achievement  of  the  successful  implementation  of  the  first \nTextbook Development Project (implemented between 1997 and 2004) \nand  provides  a  $30.0  million  loan  to  (i)  modernize  the  curriculum  and \nlearning  assessment,  (ii)  improve  textbook  development  and  learning \nmaterials, and (iii) provide textbooks and improve school libraries. The \nICTBEP provides assistance for $30 million to improve the quality and \nrelevance  of,  and  access  to,  basic  education  through  integrating \ninformation  and  communication  technology  into  teaching  and  learning. \nIn addition, ADB provides technical assistance to establish a center for \neffective management of investments and reforms in basic education to \nstrengthen  coordination  among  projects  and  build  capacity  to  improve \nthe monitoring, evaluation, and planning in the education sector. \n \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nLoan Amount  \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  opportunities  for  children \nfrom  rural  areas  to  progress  to  higher  levels  of education. The  project \noutcome  will  be  improved  equitable  access  to,  and  enhanced  quality \nand relevance of, basic education in rural areas in three project oblasts \n(provinces). The expected outcome will be achieved by (i) upgrading of \ntraining \nschool \ninstitutions  and  raion  (district)  education  departments  to  strengthen \nteaching in rural schools, and (iii) increasing community participation in \nschool life.  \n \n\nfacilities,  (ii)  enhancing \n\nthe  capacity  of \n\nteacher \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $43  million \nequivalent,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and \nduties. \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Uzbekistan  \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n30.00 \n13.00 \n43.00 \n\nPercent \n\n          70 \n          30 \n        100 \n\nADB will provide a loan in various currencies in special drawing rights \nequivalent  to  $30.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to \nfinance  70%  of  the  total  project  cost.

A  project  steering \ncommittee (PSC) will be established to provide strategic guidance and \nmonitor the implementation of the Project. The PSC will be chaired by \nthe  minister  of  MOPE  and  consist  of  eight  members  including \nrepresentatives of MOPE, the Ministry of Finance, and representatives \nfrom  mahalla  (a  community-based  body  of  citizen  self-management) \ncommittees and oblast administrations of the three project regions.  \n \nThe  Project  will  be \nthe  current  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  established  under  the  ESDP  (or  any \nsuccessor hereto acceptable to ADB) staffed by an additional six staff \nmembers, including a deputy project manager. Office space for the PIU \nwill  be  provided  by  MOPE.  The  PIU  will  report  to  the  project  director \nand  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  PSC,  MOPE,  and  ADB. \nThe PIU will work in close coordination with other ADB-funded projects, \nnamely, the STDP and ICTBEP. \n \n\nimplemented \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAll  ADB-financed  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  A  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared  to  guide \nactivities  during  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  provide \nlaboratory  equipment,  teaching  aids,  classroom  furniture,  and  learning \nmaterials. Equipment and goods estimated to cost more than $500,000 \nwill  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nEquipment  and  materials  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured under national competitive bidding on shopping procedures as \ndescribed in the procurement plan.  \n \n\nAll  consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the procurement plan. Under the three project components, a \ntotal  of  26  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  85 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  contracted, \nfinanced by ADB funds. International and national consultants financed \nfrom ADB funds will be recruited as a firm under the quality and cost-\nbased  selection  method,  using \ntechnical  proposals.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  recruit  the  PIU  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  recruiting  individual  consultants.  Consulting  services \nunder the three components will include experts in the fields of teacher \ndevelopment  and  community  participation.  In  addition,  the  Project \nprovides funding for engaging national training providers and a national \nmedia firm.  \n \n\nfull \n\nto  create  equal \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  efforts \n\nRestructuring and modernizing the education system is a priority of the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  agenda.  The  Government  is  committed  to \ninvesting  $1.2  billion  to  strengthen  the  education  system  and  remove \ndisparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools.  The  Project  will \ncomplement \nlearning \nopportunities  across  the  country  and  complement  ADB  assistance  by \nexpanding benefits achieved under other projects to rural basic schools \nin selected regions. \n \nAbout 670,000 students and 63,000 teachers will benefit from upgraded \nschool  facilities  in  the  three  project  regions.  In  addition,  by  the  end  of \nthe project, it is assumed that at least 4,000 school board members and \nparents will have benefited from training initiatives under component 3. \nAbout 45,000 grade 5\u20139 teachers will benefit from new teacher training \nprograms.  Approximately  1,600  school  managers  will  benefit  from \ntraining  under \nthe  Project.  Further,  about  450  methodologists, \nadministrators, and teacher trainers will benefit from training programs \nunder  components  2  and  3.  Communities  will  benefit  from  upgraded \nschools,  with  active  school  boards  using  school  facilities  for  adult \nlearning  and  extra-curriculum  activities,  and  social  events.  The \nimproved  ability  of  school  management  and  school  boards  to  raise \nadditional  funds  will  increase  revenue  generation  at  the  school  level \nand reduce the dependence on public budget allocations for operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  funds.  The  successful  results  of  community \nparticipation will set the basis for countrywide replication and improved \ngovernance of the education sector. \n\n\f \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \nSuccessful implementation of the Project assumes that the Government \nwill  (i)  maintain  the  budget  allocation  for  basic  education  as  indicated, \n(ii)  be  committed  to  modernizing  the  education  system,  (iii)  provide \nadequate  funding  to  finance  in-service  training  as  planned,  and  (iv) \nprovide  sufficient  funds,  calculated  at  2%  of  the  investment  cost,  for \nO&M to upgraded schools.  \n \nAt  present,  MOPE\u2019s  managerial  and  technical  capacity  is  limited,  and \nthis might affect the smooth implementation of reforming the education \nsystem.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  training  measures  for \nteachers and managers at rural schools, and capacity-building activities \nunder other ADB-financed projects. Promoting community participation \nand  adopting  a  participatory  and  transparent  approach  to  project \nimplementation,  actively  involving  school  directors,  teachers,  parents, \nand civil-society groups, will strengthen governance at the school level.  \n \nFinancial risks involve potential difficulties in the provision of recurrent \ncosts  for  O&M.  ADB  is  planning  to  conduct  a  study  on  education \nfinancing  and  assist  the  Government  in  increasing  efficiency  of  the \neducation  financing  mechanism.  During  project  implementation,  ADB \nwill  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  ensure  adequate  resource \nallocation  for  the  education  sector  and  incremental  recurrent  costs  for \nO&M.  Appropriate  assurances  are  included  in  the  project  design.  In \naddition,  the  Project\u2019s  strategy  aims  to  reduce  the  dependency  on \npublic allocations by promoting income generation at the school level.  \n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f'\n\nE\n0\n0\n \n \n9\n6\n\no\n\n'\n\nE\n0\n0\n \n \n0\n6\n\no\n\n'\n\nN\n0\n0\n \n \n5\n4\n\no\n\nN\nA\nT\nS\n\nI\n\nK\nE\nB\nZ\nU\n\n \n\nI\n\nT\nC\nE\nJ\nO\nR\nP\nN\nO\nT\nA\nC\nU\nD\nE\nC\nS\nA\nB\nL\nA\nR\nU\nR\n\n \n\n \n\nI\n\na\ne\nS\n \n \nl\na\nr\nA\n\ni\n\na\ny\nn\ne\nd\nz\no\nr\nz\no\nV\n\nl\n\nd\nn\na\ns\nI\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n'\n\nN\n0\n0\n \n \n5\n4\n\no\n\nN\nA\nT\nS\nH\nK\nA\nZ\nA\nK\n\n'\n\nN\n0\n0\n \n \n9\n3\n\no\n\na\nn\na\ng\nr\ne\nF\n\nn\na\nd\nr\no\nJ\n\nh\nk\nu\nS\n\nZ\nY\nG\nR\nY\nK\n\nC\n\nI\nL\nB\nU\nP\nE\nR\n\nN\nA\nJ\nI\nD\nN\nA\n\nn\na\nj\ni\n\nd\nn\nA\n\nd\nn\na\nk\no\nK\n\nn\na\ng\nn\na\nm\na\nN\n\nN\nA\nG\nN\nA\nM\nA\nN\n\ni\n\nk\nh\nc\nr\ni\nh\nC\n\nT\nN\nE\nK\nH\nS\nA\nT\n\nn\ne\nr\ng\nn\nA\n\nA\nN\nA\nG\nR\nE\nF\n\nA\nY\nR\nA\nD\nR\nY\nS\n\nn\na\nt\ns\n\ni\nl\n\nu\nG\n\nT\nN\nE\nK\nH\nS\nA\nT\n\nSyrdarya R.\n\nK\nA\nZ\nZ\nI\nJ\nD\n\nd\nn\na\nk\nr\na\nm\na\nS\n\nk\na\nz\nz\ni\nj\n\nD\n\nD\nN\nA\nK\nR\nA\nM\nA\nS\n\ni\n\no\nv\na\nN\n\nA\nR\nA\nH\nK\nU\nB\n\na\nr\na\nh\nk\nu\nB\n\ni\nl\n\nz\na\nG\n\n \n\nN\nA\nT\nS\n\n \n\n \n\n \nI\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nN\nE\nM\nK\nR\nU\nT\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n'\n\nN\n0\n0\n \n \n9\n3\n\no\n\nN\nA\nT\nS\n\nI\n\nK\n\nI\nJ\nA\nT\n\nu\na\nn\ne\nD\n\nA\nY\nR\nA\nD\nA\nK\nH\nS\nA\nK\n\nl\n\na\ny\nk\nO\n\ni\n\nh\ns\nr\na\nK\n\nz\ne\nm\nr\ne\nT\n\nA\nY\nR\nA\nD\nN\nA\nH\nK\nR\nU\nS\n\nl\n\na\n\nt\ni\n\np\na\nC\n\n \nl\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nc\nn\nv\no\nr\nP\n\nl\n\na\n\nt\ni\n\np\na\nC\n\n \nl\n\na\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\na\nN\n\nn\nw\no\nT\n/\ny\nt\ni\n\nC\n\nd\na\no\nR\nn\na\nM\n\n \n\ni\n\ny\na\nw\n\nl\ni\n\na\nR\n\nr\ne\nv\nR\n\ni\n\ny\nr\na\nd\nn\nu\no\nB\n\n \nl\n\na\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\na\nn\nr\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI\n\ny\nr\na\nd\nn\nu\no\nB\n\n \nl\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nc\nn\nv\no\nr\nP\n\n.\n\ne\nv\ni\nt\n\na\n\nt\ni\nr\no\nh\nu\na\n \ny\n\nt\n\nl\ni\nr\na\ns\ns\ne\nc\ne\nn\n\n \nt\n\n \n\no\nn\ne\nr\na\n\n \ns\ne\ni\nr\na\nd\nn\nu\no\nB\n\n'\n\nE\n0\n0\n \n \n9\n6\n\no\n\nN\nA\nT\nS\n\nI\n\nN\nA\nH\nG\nF\nA\n\n'\n\nE\n0\n0\n \n \n0\n6\n\no\n\n07-3848 RM\n\nN\n\n0\n5\n1\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n5\n\n0\n\ns\nr\ne\nt\ne\nm\no\n\nl\ni\n\nK\n\nN\nA\nT\nS\nH\nK\nA\nZ\nA\nK\n\nI\n\nO\nV\nA\nN\n\nk\nu\nd\nu\nk\nh\nc\nU\n\nn\na\nh\ns\nf\na\nr\na\nZ\n\nl\n\nu\nk\nt\nr\nu\nT\n\nr y\n\na\n\nd\n\nu\n\nm\n\nA\n\na   R . \n\nM\nZ\nE\nR\nO\nH\nK\n\nh\nc\nn\ne\ng\nr\nU\n\nN\nA\nT\nS\nK\nA\nP\nL\nA\nK\nA\nR\nA\nK\n\ns\nu\nk\nu\nN\n\ni\nl\n\ny\ne\nh\nz\nd\no\nh\nK\n\nk\na\nn\ny\nu\nM\n\nd\na\nr\ng\nn\nu\nK\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Rural  Basic  Education  Project  (the  Project).

About 63%  of  the population lives  in  rural and  remote  areas.  The \neconomy  has  shown  strong  performance  over  the  past  3  years.  Real  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) grew 7.3% in 2006, following growth of 7.7% in 2004 and 7.0% in 2005, mainly due to \nmacroeconomic stability and increases in exports. Agriculture accounts for about 25% of GDP, \nwith  cotton  as  the  main  agricultural  export  commodity.  Industry  contributes  about  21%,  trade \n9.2%,  transport  and  communications  11.3%,  construction  4.9%,  and  other  sectors  including \nservices  about  29%.3  The  Government  has  introduced  major  tax  reforms,  including  reduction \nand  simplification  of  rates.  Despite  lower  corporate  and  personal  income  tax  rates,  revenues \nhave continued to grow. The Central Bank has kept inflation under control and maintained tight \ntargets for most monetary aggregates. Inflation in 2006 was reported to be 6.8%, compared with \n7.5% in 2005.4 \n \n4. \nFor  2007\u20132008,  it  is  expected  that  rising  investment  and  relatively  strong  exports  will \nsupport  further  economic  growth.  GDP  is  projected  to  grow  annually  at  7%  on  average.  In \nparticular,  the  hydrocarbons  and  telecommunications  sectors  will  attract  investments,  as  will \nsome manufacturing subsectors. It is further projected that an increase in Government spending \nwill support growth in domestic demand in 2007. Although imports of capital goods will rise due \nto  the  development  of  the  hydrocarbons  sector  and  the  continued  need  of  industries  such  as \nautomotives  to  import  component  parts,  current  controls  on  imports  of  consumer  goods  will \nsuppress the overall growth in import volumes. \n \nAs noted in the Asian Development  Outlook 2007,5 external demand for  exports of the \n5. \ncountry\u2019s  commodities  is  expected  to  remain  favorable,  and  the  continued  good  economic \nperformance  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  push  through  the  structural  reforms  Uzbekistan \nneeds to diversify its economic structure in order to ensure continued high growth rates that will \ncreate employment opportunities. In particular, more reforms are needed over the medium term \n\n                                            \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila.  \n3  Information provided by the Ministry of Finance. \n4  The  International  Monetary  Fund  suggests  that  inflation  rates  are  underestimated  due  to  different  sampling  and \ncalculation  methods  applied.  However,  the  difference  between  official  and  IMF  estimates  has  been  getting \nnarrower over the past years. \n\n5  ADB. 2007. Asian Development Outlook. Manila (pp. 128\u2013130). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\naddressing  challenges  related  to  (i)  further  reducing  inflation;  (ii)  eliminating  constraints  to  the \ndevelopment of the banking system; and (iii) easing barriers to foreign trade, including reducing \ntax and administrative costs. \n \nThe country\u2019s experience suggests that, given the narrow base of the economy and its \n6. \nvulnerability  to  external  shocks,  economic  growth  per  se  does  not  immediately  translate  into \npoverty  reduction.  Poverty  incidence  remains  at  around  29.8%,6  and  rural  poverty  is  deeply \nentrenched.  About  70%  of  poor  people  live  in  rural  areas.  Strengthening  the  quality  and \nrelevance  of  education  services  is  thus  perceived  as  an  important  intervention  to  (i)  combat \npoverty,  particularly  in  rural  areas;  (ii)  widen  the  range  of  opportunities  for  employment \ngeneration; and (iii) promote competitiveness and private sector development.  \n\n \n2. \n\nEducation Sector \n\n \n7. \nBasic education in Uzbekistan includes primary and secondary levels from grades 1\u20139. \nIn the school year 2006\u20132007, about 5.7 million students were enrolled in 9,773 basic education \nschools with a total of about 450,000 teachers. About 80% of basic schools are located in rural \nareas.  Approximately  50%  of  basic  education  enrolments  are  in  grades  1\u20134.  With  a  net \nenrolment  rate  estimated  at  over  99%  and  no  gender  differentials  in  primary  education, \nUzbekistan  scores  high  on  the  two  Millennium  Development  Goals  of  achieving  universal \nprimary  education  and  eliminating  gender  disparity  in  primary  and  secondary  education. \nAppendixes 2 and 3 present details of the Uzbek education sector.  \n \n8. \nAccording  to  the  Constitution  of  Uzbekistan,  all  citizens  are  entitled  to  free  basic \neducation. In order to achieve this goal, and particularly to improve the access of poor people to \nincome generating opportunities, the Government has placed a high priority on restructuring and \nmodernizing  the  education  system.  Improving  the  quality  of  education  services,  particularly  in \nrural  areas,  should  contribute  to  (i)  achieving  steady  economic  growth,  (ii)  creating  equal \nopportunities for all by removing disparities between rural and urban regions, and (iii) improving \nliving conditions in rural areas. \n \n9. \nThe Law on Education and the National Program on Personnel and Training (NPPT) are \nthe  major  policy  documents  describing  the  Government  strategy  for  the  education  sector.  The \nNPPT,  which  was  launched  in  1997,  lays  the  foundation  for  reforming  and  strengthening  the \neducation  system.  Fundamental  policy  reforms  included  (i)  establishing  a  compulsory  12-year \neducation  system  by  increasing  senior  secondary  education  (SSE)  from  2  to  3  years,  (ii) \ninstitutional  restructuring  and  rationalizing  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Education  (MOPE)  and  the \nMinistry  of  Senior  Secondary  and  Higher  Education  (MOSSHE),  (iii)  financial  decentralization, \n(iv)  improving  public  governance  in  educational  establishments,  (v)  increasing  wages  for \nteachers  and  principals,  and  (vi)  consolidating and  modernizing  the curriculum  framework  and \nrevising education standards and learning assessments. \n \n10. \nIn accordance with the  NPPT, the  Government made a decision in 2004 to extend the \nschooling  period  by  1  year  and  establish  a  nationwide  12-year  education  system  gradually  by \n2009.  The  reformed  education  system  in  Uzbekistan  comprises  (i)  preschooling,  (ii)  primary \neducation of grades 1\u20134,  (iii) secondary education of grades 5\u20139, (iv) SSE of grades 10\u201312,7 \nand (v) higher education. After completion of basic education (grades 1\u20139), students will either \ncontinue  with  a  3-year  SSE  course  at  academic  lyceums,  or  enroll  in  professional  colleges, \n\n                                            \n6   World Bank. 2007. Uzbekistan Living Standard Assessment Report No. 25923-UZ. Washington, DC. \n7  Under the new education system to be established across the country by 2009, SSE was made compulsory and \n\nextended from 2 years (grades 10\u201311) to 3 years (grades 10\u201312). \n\n\fwhich  will  provide  a  3-year  program  combining  a  vocational  specialty  with  general  education. \nGraduates from academic lyceums and professional colleges earn diplomas, which allow them \nto  enroll  in  higher-education  institutions  or  engage  in  employment  in  the  field  of  their \nspecialization. \n \n11. \nOnce  the  new  12-year  education  system  is  established  nationwide  by  2009,  it  is \nestimated that about 1.6 million students will be enrolled in SSE institutions. To ensure that all \ngrade  9  graduates  from  basic  education  schools  can  enroll  in  the  new  3-year  SSE  programs, \nadditional resources and classroom facilities are required by 2009. In order to provide adequate \nfacilities  for  the  expected  increased  number  of  SSE  students,  the  Government  has  allocated \nadditional  funds  to  establish  176  academic  lyceums  and  1,691  professional  colleges  with  844 \nboarding facilities by 2009. Rehabilitation and construction works started in 2004. The number \nof SSE institutions has increased from 869 in 2004 to 1,055 in 2006. \n \n12.  While  basic  education  schools  are  administered  by  MOPE,  academic  lyceums  and \nprofessional  colleges  are  the  responsibility  of  MOSSHE.  MOPE  is  responsible  for  setting \neducation  policy  and  standards  in  general  education,  curriculum,  textbook  and  teacher \ndevelopment,  and  policy  and  program  implementation  through  oblast  (province)  and  raion \n(district)  departments  of  education.  In  2004,  the  Government  restructured  the  functions  and \ntasks  of  MOPE,  MOSSHE,  and  their  associated  institutions  at  the  national  and  the  provincial \nlevels  to  make  the  system  more  responsive  and  relevant  to  the  emerging  requirements  of \nUzbekistan.  The  structure  of  the  education  system  is  in  Appendix  2;  a  description  of  school \nfacilities is in Appendix 3.  \n \nPublic  expenditure  for  education  has  increased  every  year  since  2000,  and  reached \n13. \n8.1%  of  GDP  in  2006.  The  share  of  basic  education  in  total  education  expenditure  increased \nfrom 37% in 2000 to 56% in 2006, and is estimated to reach 58% in 2007. Appendix 4 describes \nthe education sector financing arrangements. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nKey Issues and Challenges \n\nlibrary \n\nlaboratory  and \n\nincluding  classrooms, \n\n \nPoor  Educational  Facilities.  In  2004,  a  comprehensive  school  mapping  survey8  was \n14. \ncarried  out  to  review  (i)  school  capacities;  (ii)  actual  enrollments;  (iii)  the  overall  condition  of \nschool  buildings \nrooms,  workshops,  and \ngymnasiums; (iv) the state of utilities and sanitary facilities; and (v) the quantity and condition of \nschool  furniture  and  sports  equipment.  The  survey  revealed  that  out  of  the  9,727  schools \ncovered by the study, more than 90% were in a poor condition requiring major rehabilitation and \nrepairs, and about 7% (684) were considered in very poor condition requiring emergency repairs. \nThe classroom capacity of schools was not in line with the growing number of students; about 1.7 \nmillion students (or 28%) were studying in 2\u20133 shift schools9. \n \n15. \nThe  majority  of  schools  were  constructed  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  and  have  seriously \ndeteriorated  as  a  consequence  of  severe  weather  conditions,  continuous  use,  and  poor \nmaintenance  due  to  years  of  underfunding  since  1991independence.  The  deterioration  of  the \nschool facilities was further exacerbated by the poor construction technology and inferior quality \nof  construction  materials  used.  Common  defects  were  leaking  roofs,  water  infiltration  to  the \n                                            \n8  Government of Uzbekistan. 2004. School Mapping Survey. \n9  Shift  schools  offer  schooling  programs  at  different  hours  to  accommodate  the  growing  number  of  students.    \nTypically there could be 2-3 shifts: morning, afternoon and evening to accommodate schooling needs and number \nof hours. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nbuilding  structures,  damaged  and  leaking  windows  and  doors,  defective  wooden  floors, \nmalfunctioning  sanitary  and  plumbing  facilities,  broken  heating  systems,  and  leaking  water \nsupply systems. Most classroom furniture was in very poor condition. About 71% of the schools \nhad  no  basic  science  laboratory  equipment,  and  about  85%  of  the  schools  had  no  modern \ncomputers.  The  lack  of  adequate  teaching  aids  and  learning  materials  is  another  major \nconstraint to applying modern teaching methodologies. \n\n16. \nRural-Urban Divide. The survey also revealed great disparities between urban and rural \nschools in the quality of school facilities, the allotment of teachers, and the allocation and quality \nof  materials,  teaching  equipment,  and  furniture.  Urban  schools  are  better  equipped  in  almost \nevery respect.  \n \nLack of Adequate Upgrading of Teaching Skills and Techniques. With over 450,000 \n17. \nteachers  (more  than  330,000  of  whom  serve  in  rural  schools),  the  Uzbek  education  system \nneeds  to  be  constantly  improving  itself.  However,  the  teaching  techniques  and  subject \nknowledge  of  many  teachers  are  inadequate  and  outdated  and  need  to  be  upgraded  and \naligned with the revised curriculum. The lack of teachers\u2019 professional competence to promote \nactive  engagement  by  students  is  a  serious  issue  that  hampers  improvement  of  education \nquality.  Teachers  also  need  assistance  to  integrate  new  laboratory  equipment  into  teaching \npractice so that practical experiments are conducted. Providing support to teachers and building \na monitoring mechanism is required to ensure that new equipment is utilized and integrated into \nthe curriculum.  \n \n18. \nAlthough training programs for teachers were revised by MOPE in 2005, the current in-\nservice  training  system  needs  to  be  more  flexible  to  adjust  to  specific  subject-related \nrequirements  of  teachers  in  rural  schools,  who  work  in  difficult  circumstances.  At  present,  the \nmajority  of  in-service  training  curricula  for  all  subject  areas  is  developed  by  the  Central \nRepublican In-Service Teacher Training Institute (TTI). Based on these curricula, the provincial \nTTIs develop training courses for teachers. Under the existing in-service system, teachers are \nrequired to participate in a 24-day training every 3 years, which combines residential training at \nthe respective provincial TTI, followed by practice activities at their home school.10  \n \n19. \nHowever,  feedback  from  teachers  indicates  that  most  in-service  training  modules  as \ncurrently  drafted  are  too  general  in  nature,  too  theoretical  in  orientation,  and  insufficiently \ngrounded in the practical conditions teachers have to cope with, particularly in rural schools.11 \nThere is also a need to improve instructional design process standards because (i) statements \nof  goals  and  objectives  often  do  not  provide  sufficient  specific  information;  (ii)  new  teaching \nmethodologies  to  be  introduced  should  be  explained  through  constant  references  to,  and \nexamples  from,  the  subject  areas  to  be  taught;  and  (iii)  the  language  and  format  of  training \nmodules  need  to  be  simplified  so  that  they  can  be  understood  easily  by  both  trainers  and \nteachers. Guidance provided to teachers during their practice activities at their home schools is \n                                            \n10  In-service training for newly assigned teachers consist of 18 days residential training followed by 6 days practice at \ntheir  home  schools;  in-service  training  for  other  teachers  consists  of  12  days  residential  training  followed  by  12 \ndays practice at their home schools. Under the ADB-funded ICTBEP, the concept of cluster leader school has been \nintroduced. Each cluster leader school links a cluster of 10 schools, and will become the center for training of the \ncluster,  bringing  training  opportunities  closer  to  teachers  in  remote  and  rural  areas,  and  hence  helping  to \ndecentralize  training  opportunities.  While  the  cluster  leader  school  concept  has  been  developed  to  first  provide \ntraining  for  the  use  of  ICT,  each  cluster  leader  school  could  be  used  as  a  service  center,  and  hence  become  a \ntraining center for the cluster, bringing together teachers from different schools and enhancing knowledge sharing \nand capacity-building opportunities. \n\n11  In the absence of a systematic needs assessment, the project preparatory technical assistance gathered possible \ninformation  on  teacher  training  needs  through  focus-group  discussions  with  teachers,  teacher  trainers,  school \nprincipals, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) at the oblast and raion level. \n\n\finformation  exchange  processes.  The \n\nweak. Due to the lack of a monitoring mechanism, no feedback is available to assess whether \nnew teaching methods and knowledge are applied in the classroom after the completion of in-\nservice training. \n \nLack  of  Modern  Teaching  Tools.  Textbooks  continue  to  dominate  the  teaching-\n20. \nlearning  materials  in  the  classroom.  There  is  recognition  that  the  range  of  teaching-learning \nmaterials  needs  to  be  broadened,  and  that  teachers  should  be  encouraged  to  (i)  develop  and \nprovide  textbook-related  additional  materials,12  (ii)  use  standard  ICT  applications  to  produce \nindividual,  context-related  learning  and  teaching  materials,  and  (iii)  practice  student-centered \nlearning arrangements shifting the teacher\u2019s roles from knowledge transfer to moderation of the \nknowledge  acquisition  and \nintegration  between \ncurriculum revision, teacher training, and textbook development also needs to be strengthened. \n \n21. \nNeed for Curriculum Development. The current curriculum is overloaded with subjects \nand  content  requirements  with  insufficient  emphasis  on  modern  learning  methodologies,  and \nthese are no longer consistent with the principles of flexibility in subject selection and a student-\ncentered  teaching  environment.  MOPE  has  started  the  process  of  revising  the  curriculum \nframework.  A  committee  has  been  established  to  review  curriculum  modules  and  prepare \nstrategies  for  consolidation.  Education  standards  and  textbooks  for  grades  1\u20139  are  being \nrevised accordingly. School exams are being amended according to uniform national standards, \nwhich  provide  a  good  basis  to  monitor  learning  achievements  nationwide.  The  ADB-funded \nSecond Textbook Development Project (STDP)13 provides assistance to reform the curriculum \nframework, align education standards, and strengthen textbook development. These efforts will \nsupport the introduction of a mandatory 12-year education system by 2009. \n \n22. \nIn  1998,  the  Government  changed  the  curriculum  from  Cyrillic  script  to  Latin  script. \nTextbooks have been transformed for all major subjects, and ADB has assisted the Government \nwith two projects focusing on the provision of textbooks14. However, to build up literacy skills of \nstudents  in  early  grades,  additional  reading  materials  are  needed,  particularly  in  rural  schools \nwhere  newspapers,  bookshops,  and  other  reading  resources  are  limited.  School  libraries  are \nused beyond school-related activities. Especially in rural areas, schools are knowledge centers \nfor  children  and  communities,  and  hence  will  be  provided  with  adequate  material.  Access  to \nknowledge is an important factor in providing more opportunities for rural and poor areas.   \n \n23. \nNeed for Stronger Community Participation. During the Soviet period, parents largely \nleft school education to teachers, as funding of school facilities was sufficient and the quality of \neducation  in  schools  was  considered  satisfactory;  hence  there  was  little  need  for  additional \nparental and community involvement in school affairs. However, at present, due to deteriorating \nschool  facilities  and  insufficient  funding  to  cover  basic  operational  and  maintenance  (O&M) \ncosts,  school  managements  frequently  appeal  to  parents  and  communities  to  provide  aid  for \nurgent  school  needs.  In  addition,  schools  have  begun  to  face  new  issues  of  student \n\n                                            \n12 For  example,  exercises,  teacher  guides,  different  methodical  approaches,  best-practice  examples  from  other \n\nteachers, and contests. \n\n13 ADB.  2004.

At  the  commencement  of  each  school  year,  families  need  to  meet  new  costs  including \nschool uniforms, textbook rentals, stationery, and informal payments for tutorials.  \n \n24. \nSchools  where  parents,  teachers,  and  community  members  are  actively  engaged  in \nproviding  support  are  better  maintained  than  schools  with  low  community  participation. \nCommunity  participation in school life can also open up opportunities for the community itself. \nThe majority of villages lack venues for learning and recreation activities for adults and children. \nThus,  more  and  more  communities  are  exploring  possibilities  to  utilize  school  facilities  as \nknowledge  centers  and  community  focal  points  for  organizing  social  events,  sports  and \nrecreation  activities,  training,  and  information  programs  for  young  and  adult  community \nmembers. Increasing community participation in school life would lead to better services to the \ncommunity  itself,  enhanced  opportunities,  and  increased  efficiency  of  investments  in  school \nequipment and facilities.16 \n \nThe Government encourages community participation in education to improve the quality \n25. \nof education and strengthen governance and accountability in schools. The legal framework for \ncommunity  participation  is  provided  in  (i)  the  NPPT,  (ii)  the  Law  on  Education,  and  (iii)  the \nRegulation  on  General  Education.  All  documents  promote  the  establishment  of  school  boards \nand  parental  committees  to  increase  public  governance  and  ensure  greater  transparency  in \ndecision-making processes in schools. In support of the legal framework, MOPE developed the \npartnership concept of Family-Mahalla-School,17 which broadly defines roles and responsibilities \nof  parents  and  other  community  stakeholders  to  support  the  education  process  at  the  school \nlevel.  In  view  of  limited  public  funds  for  repair  and  maintenance  of  facilities,  MOPE  also \nencourages  schools  to  generate  revenues  to  reduce  dependency  on  public  allocations.  The \nauthority to manage these revenues has been delegated to school boards.18 \n \nAlthough  the  legal  framework  encourages  community  participation,  the  status  and \n26. \nmandates  of  school  boards  and  parental  committees  are  not  clearly  defined  in  the  policy \ndocuments, and it is hence left to the goodwill of the community and its members to participate \nin school life and benefit from the schools becoming knowledge and community life centers. So \nfar  about  65%  of  all  basic  schools  have  established  school  boards.  However,  field  visits \nrevealed  that  existing  school  boards,  particularly  in  rural  schools,  lack  experience  and \nknowledge to be actively involved in school affairs, and have weak capacity to develop school \nimprovement  plans,  identify  income  generating  activities,  and  raise  funds.  Lack  of  monitoring \nmechanisms to review education quality, teacher performance and learning achievements, and \ntransparent mechanisms to monitor off-budget funds, are issues raised by community members \nand  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  during  the  field  visits.  More  information  on \ncommunity participation in basic education is in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n                                            \n15 Surveys  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)-funded  education  project  and \nfeedback from communities, parents, and students during field visits revealed increasing absenteeism in schools.     \n16 ADB is planning to conduct a study on education financing, including a survey of parental contribution to education. \nThe data collected  will be used as the  basis for suggesting new mechanisms for education financing to increase \nthe efficiency of the sector and strengthen its governance. \n\n17 Mahallas are village councils. \n18 Typical  revenue  generating  activities  include:  selling  produce  from  fruit  and  vegetable  school-gardens,  fees  for \ninformation  and  training  courses  for  adults  and  youth,  renting  facilities  for  community  activities,  and  organizing \nhobby clubs.  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f2. \n\nGovernment Policy and Strategy in the Education Sector \n\n \n27. \nIn  response  to  the  findings  of  the  2004  education  sector  survey  (see  para.  14),  the \nGovernment launched the National Program for Basic Education Development (NPBED) 2004\u2013\n2009,  which  aims  to  strengthen  basic  education  to  meet  international  standards  and  remove \ndisparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools,  thereby  creating  equal  opportunities  for  all \nstudents. The NPBED promotes reforms in the basic education system by (i) providing financial \nsupport  to  improve  the  physical  school  conditions  through  construction  and  rehabilitation  of \nbuildings and facilities; (ii) equipping all basic schools with new laboratories, modern computer \nrooms, and adequate furniture and teaching aids; (iii) providing free textbooks and educational \nmaterials  to  teachers;  (iv)  improving  education  standards;  (v)  reviewing  and  modernizing  the \ncurriculum framework; (vi) ensuring that rural areas are provided with highly qualified teaching \nstaff;  (vii)  introducing  new  student-centered  teaching  approaches;  (viii)  increasing  teacher \nincentives; and (ix) developing sports activities in all basic schools.  \n \n28. \nThe  investment  costs  of  the  NPBED,  which  are  estimated  at  $1.2  billion,  are  being \nfinanced by a combination of 75% budget financing, 20% foreign investment financing, and 5% \nlocal  voluntary  contributions.  By  2009,  at  least  8,476  schools  should  be  covered  under  the \nNPBED,  and  this  includes  almost  87%  of  all  basic  schools  in  the  country.  The  NPBED  also \nprovides  funds  for  establishing  incentive  schemes  to  motivate  and  award  high-performing \nteachers  and  directors,  improve  in-service  teacher  training,  and  strengthen  curriculum \ndevelopment and learning assessments.  \n \n29. \nIn  order  to  implement  the  NPBED,  the  Government  has  established  the  School \nDevelopment Fund (SDF). The SDF is financed by a 1% tax on enterprise revenues and by in-\nkind  contributions  from  donors,  local  sponsors,  and  local  government.  Although  under  the \nprogram many schools have been successfully rehabilitated, the Government capacities do not \nfully  meet  the  demands  to  provide  newly  rehabilitated  schools  with  necessary  classroom \nfurniture, upgraded laboratory equipment, and teaching aids nationwide. Thus, the Government \nwill  partially  depend  on  external  assistance  to  successfully  complete  the  ambitious  reform \nprogram. \n \nThe  Government  has  demonstrated  continued  strong  commitment  to  reform  of  the \n30. \neducation  sector,  completing  the  transition  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  education  system  from  the  Soviet \nmodel  to  a  system  that  is  consistent  with  internationally  accepted  requirements.  Fundamental \npolicy  reforms  in  restructuring  and modernizing  the  education  sector  have  been  adopted  to  (i) \nintroduce  a  new  curriculum,  (ii)  develop  new  textbooks  and  learning  materials,  (iii)  introduce \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) in schools, and (iv) sustain a new approach to \nteacher  training.  The  Government  is  beginning  to  achieve  successful  results  under  various \nADB-supported activities. However, a major constraint in providing quality education services for \nall  students  countrywide  is  completing  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  program  under  the \nNPBED, in order to provide all schools with adequate equipment and materials to sustain new \neducation  programs  and  meet  student  needs.  While  it  has  started  equipping  schools  with \nmodern  facilities,  and  international  donors  are  providing  assistance,  there  is  still  a  significant \nshortfall.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAddressing  the  issue  of  poor  school  facilities,  8,476  schools  have  been  selected  to  be \n31. \nupgraded under the NPBED by 2009.19 Although rehabilitation works are progressing well, and \nGovernment  data  indicates  that  3,441  schools  had  been  rehabilitated  by  2006,  field  visits  to \nrural schools revealed that, depending on the funding allocation for each school, rehabilitation \nworks  often  could  only  address  selected  priorities.  While  rehabilitation  of  school  buildings  is \nproceeding  at  a  fast  rate,  in  many  schools  additional  resources  are  required  to  provide \nlaboratory equipment, furniture, teaching aids, and reading materials. ADB financing under the \nproposed  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  further  upgrade  rural  schools  covered  by  the \nNPBED in three selected regions, and will provide support for integration of laboratory practice \nin  teaching  for  increased  quality  of  education.  School  visits  revealed  three  main  areas  to  be \nimproved, in addition to the lack of equipment for laboratories in rural schools, which remains a \npriority  and  the  most  expensive  investment.  The  three  areas  are  (i)  the  need  for  library \nmaterials,  (ii)  teaching  practices  and  training,  and  (iii)  community  participation.  Adopting \nmeasures  to  address  the  three  areas  will  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the  reform \nprogram  under  the  NPBED  and  an  efficient  use  of  equipment  provided  to  schools,  which \nremains the priority investment need of the country. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n3. \n \n32. \nBasic  education  is  a  key  area  of  ADB  assistance  to  Uzbekistan,  and  ADB  is  the  lead \nexternal  development  partner  in  basic  education.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update \n(2006\u20132008)20  highlights  the  importance  of  reducing  poverty  by  promoting  private-sector  led \neconomic  growth  and  human  resource  development,  which  includes  promoting  general \neducation. \n \n33. \nADB assistance to the education sector in Uzbekistan has evolved since 1997 to support \nthe  Government  in  different  stages  of  reforming  and  strengthening  the  education  system. \nAssistance includes support for the establishment of a comprehensive policy reform framework \nand  reform  the  education  system  with  special  focus  on  (i)  modernizing  the  structure,  content, \nand  process  of  education;  (ii)  improving  sector  sustainability  and  efficiency;  (iii)  reforming \ngovernance of education; and (iv) providing protection to vulnerable students21. In addition ADB \nis  providing  assistance  to  (i)  modernize  the  curriculum  and  learning  assessment,  (ii)  improve \ntextbook development and learning materials, and (iii) provide textbooks and establish libraries \nin  selected  schools22.  Finally  ADB  is  supporting  the  Government  to  improve  the  quality  and \nrelevance of, and access to, basic education through integrating ICT in teaching and learning23. \nIn addition, ADB is currently supporting the establishment of a center for effective management \nof  investments  and  reforms  in  basic  education24  that  will  contribute  to  strengthening  the \ncoordination  among  projects  and  build  the  capacity  to  improve  monitoring,  evaluation,  and \nplanning in the education sector. The proposed new Project will build on lessons learned from \n\n                                            \n19  The  remaining  schools  were  built  in  the  1990s  and  hence  are  considered  new.  However,  they  will  be  already \nalmost  20  years  old  once  the  NPBED  comes  to  an  end  in  2009.  Continuous  support  to  school  upgrading  and \nmaintenance will be a future challenge for Uzbekistan.  \n\n20 Refer to footnote number 2. \n21  ADB.  2002.

In line with the NPBED, the Project will provide funding to help the \nGovernment  to  successfully  implement  the  school  rehabilitation  program  in  three  selected \nregions. The Project will complement ADB-funded activities by focusing on investment needs in \nrural  schools,  which  have  not  been  addressed  by  previous  interventions,  and  by  enhancing \noutputs  of  other  ADB-funded  projects  by  extending  materials  developed  under  the  ESDP, \nSTDP, and ICTBEP.  \n \n34.  While  additional  funds  will  be  necessary  to  achieve  all  outputs  under  the  NPBED,  the \nproposed  Project  will  support  the  Government  in  completing  the  reform  effort  in  the  three \nselected  regions,  while  other  donors  will  target  remaining  regions  in  the  next  few  years.  To \naddress  the  issue  of  inequality  in  the  provision  of  education  services  in  rural  areas,  it  is \nproposed that the new ADB intervention will complement the Government\u2019s NPBED and focus \non  a  priority  area  for  improving  the  quality  of  basic  education,  this  being  the  provision  of \nlaboratory  equipment  and  library  material  with  special  focus  on  three  selected  regions.  The \nproposed Project will support improvements in learning and teaching environments in selected \nrural schools in (i) Tashkent oblast, (ii) Surkandarya, and (iii) Kashkadarya. It will complement \nother  ongoing  ADB  interventions  in  the  education  sector  which  already  provide  assistance  at \ncountry level in addressing issues related to (i) policy planning, governance, and management; \n(ii)  curriculum  modernization  and  textbook  development;  and  (iii)  improving  teaching  and \nlearning  through  ICT.  To  supplement  these  interventions,  the  World  Bank  financed  education \nproject25  includes  support  to  address  issues  related  to  education  financing  and  provision  of \nteaching aids in eight regions of the country, including Kashkadarya and Surkandarya which are \nincluded  in  the  proposed  Project.  In  addition,  ADB  is  currently  undertaking  a  comprehensive \nsector  analysis  to  assess  strategic  areas  for  further  assistance  to  increase  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of the education system. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons \n\n \nThe  proposed  project  design  takes  into  consideration  experience  gained  and  lessons \n35. \nlearned in implementing the ESDP, the ongoing STDP, and the ICTBEP. Some of the previous \nADB  projects  in  Uzbekistan  tended  to  be  overambitious,  with  a  large  number  of  components \nand subcomponents and complex implementation arrangements. Due to the limited capacity in \nthe education sector, this complicated the project implementation. The proposed Project will be \nimplemented  by  one  executing  agency  and  focus  primarily  on  school  upgrading,  teacher \ndevelopment,  and  community  participation  in  three  regions  in  order  to  complement  and \nstrengthen ongoing Government initiatives and complete the efforts under the NPBED in these \nareas. The Project will be facilitated by the current project implementation unit (PIU) established \nunder  the  ESDP  and  is  experienced  in  procurement-related  matters,  including  identifying \ntechnical specifications and preparing tender documents. The proposed Project will benefit from \nthe technical experience in school upgrading gained under the NPBED. The selection criteria for \nschools  to  be  included  in  the  proposed  Project  will  include  indicators  to  increase  community \nparticipation, and will support schools with active school boards and parental committees. \n \n36. \nThe ESDP and ICTBEP have developed strategies for using ICT and distance education \nmethods  to  improve  teacher  training.  The  proposed  Project  will  benefit  from  established \nmechanisms  and  lessons  learned  that  will  help  to  strengthen  teacher  development  in  rural \nschools.  Further  lessons  relate  to  the  need  to  ensure  that  (i)  adequate  O&M  budgets  and \npreventive  maintenance  of  rehabilitated  school  facilities  are  provided,  and  (ii)  the  necessary \ninfrastructure is in place prior to the provision of modern teaching and learning equipment.  \n\n                                            \n25 World Bank. 2006. Basic Education Phase 1. Washington, DC (approved on 26 October, for $15 million). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector  \n\n \n37. \nADB has been the lead development partner in the education sector in Uzbekistan since \nthe mid-1990s. Complementing ADB\u2019s support to the education sector, in 2006 the World Bank \nprovided  assistance  to  improve  learning  conditions  in  preschools  and  strengthening  education \nquality  in  primary  education  in  seven  selected  regions.  The  World  Bank  project  operates  in \nseven provinces and includes (i) increasing the availability of teaching and learning materials in \n1,500 preschools and general schools, (ii) enhancing the capacity of teacher training institutions \nto strengthen teaching techniques of grade 1\u20134 teachers, (iii) increasing community involvement \nin  schools,  (iv)  creating  conditions  for  funding  schools  on  a  per  capita  basis,  and  (v)  building \nmanagerial  capacity  in  MOPE.  Depending  on  the  achievements,  a  second  phase  might  be \ninitiated, providing a new loan of $25 million. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are monitoring \nlearning  achievements  in  basic  education.26  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID)  supported  teacher  development,  school  management,  and  community \nparticipation  in  about  100  schools,  and  piloted  ICT  use  in  60  schools.  USAID\u2019s  projects  have \nbeen  completed.  Some  bilateral  partners,  such  as  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  and \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) all provide support in vocational and higher education. The \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  provided  a  loan  of  $19  million  to  Uzbekistan  in  support  of  ICT  in \nbasic education. The Government of Korea provided computers to selected schools to support \nICT  in  education.  Inputs  by  these  agencies  have  been  relatively  modest  in  financial  terms.  A \ndevelopment  coordination  matrix  is  in  Appendix  13.  The  proposed  Project  complements  these \ninitiatives in two key respects. First, it addresses the severe school infrastructure and learning \nconstraints in rural basic schools. In that sense, it will be targeted to increase access to quality \neducation in rural areas. Second, it provides an innovative approach to community participation \nand integrating teacher training efforts under other ADB-funded activities. \n \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n38. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  opportunities  for  children  in  rural  areas  to \nprogress to higher levels of education. The expected project outcome is more equitable access \nto, and improved quality and relevance of, basic education in rural areas in three project oblasts. \nGiven  the  well-established  link  between  improved  quality  of  education  and  poverty  reduction, \nthe  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  through  the  improved  quality  of  education  in \nUzbekistan, where an estimated 70% of the poor live in rural areas. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n \n39. \nThe  Project  consists  of  three  closely  related  components  aiming  at  improving  learning \nand teaching environments in rural schools. The first component focuses on upgrading selected \nrural schools through the provision of laboratory equipment, teaching aids, classroom furniture, \nand  reading  material.  The  second  component  aims  at  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  in \nschools  by  upgrading  teaching  skills  and  competencies  of  teachers.  The  third  component \nfocuses  on  improving  the  school  environment  by  strengthening  community  participation,  for \nincreased efficiency in school governance. MOPE has selected three oblasts as the target areas \nfor this Project: (i) Tashkent oblast, (ii) Surkhandarya, and (iii) Kashkadarya. The selection has \nbeen based both on poverty and education quality indicators, as well as assessment estimating \n\n                                            \n26 Results  published  in  2006  confirmed  that  learning  achievements  have  been  improved  through  the  reform  efforts \n\nand are being considered generally satisfactory. \n\n\fthe  financial  requirements  to  complete  the  upgrading  of  schools  in  the  three  areas.  While \nKashkadarya and Surkandarya are among the poorest regions of the country, Tashkent oblast, \ndespite  having  a  lower  incidence  of  poverty,  has  higher  disparities  between  urban  and  rural \nareas and deteriorating education quality. The project will hence benefit all regions by targeting \nrural  and  remote  schools  and  thereby  enhancing  quality  of  education.  A  description  of  the \nproject oblasts is in Appendix 6. \n\n \n1. \n\nComponent 1: Upgrading Rural Schools  \n\n \n40. \nIn  support  of  the  NPBED,  the  Project  will  complement  Government  efforts  to  upgrade \nfacilities  of  rural  basic  education  schools.  While  the  Government  will  finance  civil  works  to \nrehabilitate  and  construct  schools  under  the  NPBED,  ADB  financing  will  be  used  for  the \nprovision of (i) modern science laboratory equipment, laboratory furniture, and teaching aids for \nbiology,  chemistry,  and  physics;  (ii)  classroom  furniture;  (iii)  general  teaching  aids,  and  (iv) \nreading  materials  and  basic  furniture  for  libraries  in  at  least  700  schools  in  the  three  project \nprovinces,  to  complete  Government  efforts  in  the  Project  region.  The  Project  will  also  provide \nadditional funding for installation works, water piping, and electrical line connections within the \nlaboratory  rooms  to  ensure  that  the  laboratories  will  be  functional  after  the  installation  of  the \nequipment. A description of laboratory needs is in Appendix 6. \n \n41. \nOnly  newly  constructed  schools  and  schools  which  have  been  comprehensively \nrehabilitated  under  the  NPBED  will  be  considered  for  ADB  financing  under  this  component. \nMOPE  will  ensure  that  science  laboratory  and  library  rooms  at  schools  are  suitable  to \naccommodate equipment and materials to be provided under the Project. Based on the school \nmapping  survey  and  on  rehabilitation  plans  to  be  financed  under  the  NPBED,  MOPE  will \nprepare a preliminary list of schools which have been fully rehabilitated and newly constructed \nin the three project provinces. A list of criteria for selection of schools and steps for selection is \ndescribed in Appendix 7. \n \nThe final selection of schools for ADB support will be carried out on a competitive basis \n42. \nto foster community participation in school life and ensure that equipment and materials to be \nprovided  to  the  schools  will  be  effectively  and  efficiently  utilized.  Principals  of  schools  which \nhave been fully rehabilitated and listed on a preliminary basis by MOPE for ADB support will be \ninvited  to  prepare  a  school  improvement  plan  in  close  cooperation  with  school  boards  and \nparental  committees.  A  format  of  school  improvement  plan  will  be  prepared  by  the  PIU  in \ncooperation  with  experts  of  MOPE  and  be  provided  to  schools  for  guidance.  The  school \nimprovement  plan  will  provide  information  on  (i)  community  participation  in  school  life;  (ii) \ninventory  indicating  quantity  and  current  condition  of  biology,  chemistry,  and  physics \nlaboratories, teaching-aids, furniture, supplies, and consumables; (iii) the availability of teachers \nand  laboratory  assistants  for  each  science  subject  and  their  qualifications;  (iv)  plans  for \nintegration  of  laboratory  practice  into  the  curriculum;  (v)  the  method  for  monitoring  that \nequipment  is  integrated  into  the  teaching  process;  (vi)  sufficient  funding  for  O&M  of  the \nequipment  and  provision  of  consumables;  (vii)  planned  after-school  activities;  (viii)  planned \nfundraising  activities  and  estimated  revenues  or  in-kind  assistance  to  support  the  O&M  of \nscience laboratory rooms and equipment; and (ix) a plan to encourage students, teachers, and \ncommunity members to maximize the use of reading materials to be provided to the library.  \n \n43.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOPE  will  establish  a  selection  committee  at \neach  project  province  to  ensure  (i)  transparency  of  the  selection  process,  (ii)  proper \ncommunication with eligible schools, and (iii) that improvement plans received from schools are \nproperly evaluated. The terms of reference for the selection committee are in Appendix 7. Each \ncommittee  will  consist  of  five  members,  including  one  representative  from  the  oblast \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fadministration,  two  representatives  from  raion  administrations,  and  two  representatives  from \ncivil society organizations. During the project implementation period, the committees will meet at \nthe beginning of each calendar year to prioritize schools for upgrading for each year. The key \ncriterion  for  inclusion  in  the  Project  will  be  (i)  evidence  of  active  community  participation,  (ii) \nphysical readiness of school facilities to install new laboratory equipment and establish libraries, \n(iii)  sufficient  funding  for  O&M  costs,  (iv)  clear  programs  showing  integration  of  laboratory \npractice  in  the  curriculum,  and  (v)  a  list  of  material  and  funds  received  under  other  projects \nsince 2003. The priority lists will be submitted to MOPE for a final decision. The final selection of \nschools, and equipment and furniture packages for each school, will be submitted by MOPE to \nADB for concurrence.   \n  \n44. \nThe  utilization  of  laboratory  equipment  will  be  jointly  monitored  by  MOPE,  raion \neducation administrators, and the PIU. MOPE will provide ADB with quarterly monitoring reports \nconfirming  that  the  new  equipment  is  integrated  into  lesson  plans  and  used  by  students  and \nteachers. The Project will provide funds to engage a domestic consultant to support monitoring \nactivities and verify that the new equipment is fully utilized.  \n  \n45. \nIn  order  to  further  promote  functional  literacy  of  students  in  early  grades  and  improve \nreading  comprehension,  knowledge,  and  language  learning,  the  Project  will  complement  the \nongoing  STDP  by  supporting  the  establishment  of  school  libraries  and  provide  a  package  of \nreading  and  reference  materials  and  library  furniture.  Within  2  months  of  loan  effectiveness, \nMOPE will organize a committee that will determine the list of published reading materials to be \nprocured under the Project and in coordination with actions under the STDP. MOPE will submit \na list of committee members to ADB for concurrence. Under component 2, the Project will help \nteachers to improve teaching techniques and lesson planning, ensuring that the new equipment \nand reading materials are actively utilized by students in the learning process. \n   \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Teacher Development  \n\n \nThis  component  will  address  the  inflexibility  of  the  current  in-service  teacher  training \n46. \nsystem  which  is  not  adequately  focused  on  the  specific  subject-related  needs  of  teachers  in \nrural  schools.  The  objective  of  this  component  is  to  further  enhance  the  professional \ncompetence  of  grade  5\u20139  teachers  working  at  schools  supported  by  the  Project.  This  will  be \ndone  by  (i)  strengthening  the  ability  and  expertise  in  the  respective  three  provincial  TTIs  to \nprepare  and  deliver  needs-based  teacher-training  modules  which  foster  curriculum-relevant \nstudent-centered lessons and learning activities for specific subject groups; and (ii) developing \ncapacities  of  raion  education  departments  to  (a)  provide  regular  guidance  to  teachers,  (b) \nfacilitate  information  exchange  among  teachers  and  TTIs,  and  (c)  monitor  and  support  the \nprogress  in  improving  teaching  techniques  in  the  classroom.  After  the  new  teacher  training \ncourses  are  successfully  established  in  the  three  project  provinces,  the  new  approach  to \ndevelop  and  conduct  needs  based  teacher  training  programs  will  be  replicated  in  all  other \nprovincial TTIs and integrated in the current national in-service teacher training system. \n \n47. \nThe  component  will  help  to  (i)  increase  the  access  to,  and  frequency  of,  training \nopportunities for teachers in rural schools; and (ii) make the current in-service teacher training \nsystem  more  responsive  and  focused  on  the  specific  needs  of  teachers  in  rural  schools,  who \nare working under difficult conditions due to a lack of appropriate teaching aids and materials.  \n \n48. \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  the  training  of  84  teacher  trainers  from  the  respective  TTIs \n(two trainers per each subject group) and 300 methodologists from raion education departments \non  (i)  strategies  to  promote  continuing  professional  teacher  development,  (ii)  approaches  to \nidentify  specific  subject-related  needs  of  teachers,  (iii)  student-centered  learning  and  teaching \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fmethods  which  focus  on  the  development  of  competencies  and  higher-order  thinking  skills \nacross all curriculum subjects for grades 5\u20139, and (iv) the means to integrate into lessons the \nuse of new equipment to be provided by the Project.  \n \nBased  on  joint  needs  assessments  for  each  subject  group,  training  modules  will  be \n49. \ndeveloped by expert groups consisting of training curriculum development specialists from the \nTTIs  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants  financed  by  the  Project.  Selected  teachers  and \nmethodologists  from  the  raion  education  departments  will  be  closely  involved  in  the \ndevelopment process. The new teacher training programs will be subject-specific and consist of \nshort needs-based training modules that include individual tasks and teamwork activities to be \norganized in the home schools of teachers. Teachers will receive regular guidance from teacher \ntrainers and raion methodologists. TTI trainers, in close cooperation with raion methodologists, \nwill organize workshops at schools to demonstrate exemplary new training modules and provide \nsupport  to  organize  informal  learning  activities  within  and  among  schools.  To  enhance  the \nexchange  of  information  and  experiences  among  teachers,  achievements  in  applying  new \nteaching  approaches  will  be  jointly  reviewed  in  follow-up  workshops  organized  by  TTIs  and \nraion education departments. In addition to existing in-service teacher training conducted at the \nTTIs,  trained  teacher  trainers  will  regularly  conduct  short,  needs-based  training  courses \ndeveloped  under  the  Project  at  selected  schools.  Moreover,  300  trained  raion  methodologists \nwill  provide  regular  guidance  to  teachers  at  their  home  schools.  Bringing  the  training  down  to \nthe  school  level  will  increase  the  access  to  training  opportunities  for  teachers  in  remote  rural \nareas.  \n \n50. \nAs  far  as  possible,  the  use  of  ICT  should  be  integrated  into  new  training  approaches, \nthus  improving  the  development  of  learning  materials  and  teaching  aids.  In  designing  teacher \ntraining  programs  and  establishing  a  flexible  mechanism  to  deliver  training  to  schools,  the \nProject  will  take  into  account  (i)  relevant  distance  education  modules  developed  under  the \nESDP,  (ii)  training  approaches  to  improve  teaching  and  learning  of  particular  subjects \ndeveloped under the ICTBEP, and (iii) innovative approaches to use teaching materials at the \nlocal learning resource centers established by the STDP. \n \n51. \nThe Project will provide consultant support and funding to organize training workshops to \nenable  methodologists  from  the  raion  education  departments  within  the  Project  regions  to  (i) \nprovide regular advice to teachers, (ii) facilitate information sharing, (iii) monitor improvements \nin  applying  student-centered  teaching  techniques,  and  (iv)  monitor  whether  new  laboratory \nequipment  and  teaching  aids  supplied  under  the  Project  are  appropriately  utilized by  teachers \nand students. \n \n52. \nAt  the  national  level,  the  Project  will  organize  workshops  to  develop  a  general \nunderstanding among relevant stakeholders from MOPE, Cabinet of Ministers, the central TTI, \nprovincial  TTIs,  and  district  education  administrations  on  (i)  strategies  to  further  improve  and \ncomplement the current in-service teacher training, (ii) capacity-building needs for strengthening \nmodern  teacher  development  strategies,  and  (iii)  identifying  strategies  to  integrate  new  short \nneeds-based training modules into the current in-service training curricula.  \n \nIn order to validate that teachers trained under the Project are applying student-centered \n53. \nteaching  methods  and  utilizing  new  equipment  (which  subsequently  should  lead  to  better \nlearning achievements of students) the Project will provide funding to implement a benchmark \nsurvey. At the beginning of the Project, a local firm specializing in social studies will carry out a \nbaseline  study  to  establish  indicators  against  which  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  Project  on \nlearning  outputs  and  teaching  environments.  The  international  consultants  engaged  under  the \nProject will provide support in analyzing the results. To compare results, the baseline study will \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nidentify  sample  schools  supported  by  the  Project  and  sample  schools  that  will  not  receive \nassistance from any donor-supported project. The monitoring exercise will be conducted on an \nannual basis starting at the end the second year of implementation. An assessment system to \nreview  teacher  training  programs  conducted  by  TTI  will  be  developed  by  the  international \nconsultant. The feedback will be used to revise training modules accordingly.   \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Community Participation \n\n \n54. \nIn support of the national Family-Community-School partnership concept, the proposed \nProject  will  assist  MOPE  in  promoting  community  participation  in  school  affairs  through  (i)  the \nestablishment  of  school  boards  at  all  schools  supported  under  the  Project  and  assistance  to \nstrengthen  already  existing  school  boards  in  schools  in  the  three  project  provinces,  (ii)  the \ndevelopment of a training program for raion education offices and TTIs to promote community \nparticipation in school life, and (iii) raising public awareness on the benefits of quality education \nand community participation in school life. \n \n55. \nAt the school level, the Project will assist MOPE to organize training programs for school \nboard members, school managements, and raion education officers on planning, implementing, \nand  monitoring  of  school  improvement  initiatives  such  as  (i)  fundraising;  (ii)  maintenance  and \nimprovement  of  education  facilities;  (iii)  organizing  social  events,  recreation  activities,  and \neducational  programs \nfor  adult  and  youth  community  members;  (iv)  arrangement  of \nextracurricular activities for school children; and (v) support measures for low-income families. \n \n56. \nThe  training  program  for  school  boards  will  benefit  from  successful  experiences \ndeveloped  under  other  donor-supported  projects27  and  NGOs,  and  will  build  on  those  to \nmaximize benefits and avoid duplications. The Project will provide funding for international and \nnational  consultants  to  (i)  prepare  training  packages,  and  (ii)  train  a  group  of  qualified  core \ntrainers selected from NGOs and within the education system, who in turn will conduct training \nfor  school  board  members,  school  principals,  and  administrators  from  raion  and  oblast \neducation  offices.  The  training  will  be  conducted  at  selected  schools  in  the  project  provinces. \nThe  Project  will  provide  funding  for  engaging  national  training  providers  and/or  NGOs  to \nfacilitate the training programs in coordination with core trainers.  \n \nIn order to strengthen the competency of oblast and raion education offices and TTIs to \n57. \nfurther stimulate parent participation and community engagement in school life, the Project will \nengage  consultants  to  develop  training  modules  and  materials  to  qualify  relevant  staff  to \npromote  community  mobilization  in  school  life.  Oblast  and  raion  officers  will  be  trained  to \nprovide  advice  to  school  managements,  school  boards,  and  mahallas  (village  committees)  on \nschool  improvements  schemes  and  open  schools  to  become  social  focal  points  in  villages \noffering learning and recreation activities for all community members. \n \nIn  order  to  address  the  lack  of  knowledge  on  the  values  of  community  participation  in \n58. \nschool life and to foster the concept of opening schools for community activities, the Project will \nprovide  funding  to  engage  a  professional  domestic  media  firm  to  (i)  prepare  an  awareness \ncampaign; and (ii) facilitate regular reporting in newspapers, radio, and television of community \nengagement in school activities and the achievements of successful community participation.  \n \n \n \n\n                                            \n27 UNICEF  and  the  USAID  Participation,  Education,  and  Knowledge  Strengthening  (PEAKS)  project  successfully \nsupported  community  participation  in  pilot  schools;  a  World  Bank  funded  project  also  includes  a  component  to \nstimulate community involvement in schools. See appendix 12 for detailed description. \n\n\fSpecial Features \n\nC. \n \n59. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  complement  the  Government\u2019s  NPBED  aiming  at \ncreating  equal  opportunities  for  all  students  by  removing  disparities  between  rural  and  urban \nschools.  The  Project  has  three  key  strategies  to  address  regional  inequalities:  (i)  upgrading \nschool  facilities  in  rural  areas;  (ii)  creating  flexible  mechanisms  for  further  development  of \nteachers engaged in rural schools by improving the quality and frequency of in-service training; \nand  (iii)  promoting  community  participation  in  school  life  to  improve  learning  environments  for \nstudents and opening schools to all community members for social and recreation activities and \nlearning programs. \n \n60. \nCommunity participation is an important feature of the Project. A significant criterion for \nschools to be included for upgrading under the Project will be the extent to which communities \nare participating in school life and contributing to the maintenance and improvement of school \nfacilities.  The  communities  are  to  base  their  level  of  contribution  on  what  is  affordable. \nContributions from parents and other community members include cash, labor, or participation \nin  planning  and  implementation  of  school  improvement  activities.  Under  component  3  the \nProject  provides  support  to  establish  and  strengthen  active  school  boards.  The  inclusion  of \nschools for upgrading under component 1 will carried out on a competitive basis. School boards \nwill  develop  improvement  plans  jointly  with  school  managements.  The  involvement  of  school \nboards  in  school  management  will  improve  public  governance  at  schools.  In  opening  rural \nschools  to  all  community  members  for  social  and  recreational  activities  and  learning  and \ninformation  programs,  the  proposed  Project  will  contribute  to  improve  the  living  conditions  in \npoor  villages.  Active  community  participation  in  school  management  and  the  design  of  after \nschool activities will ensure that training and recreational programs are demand driven.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $43.0 million equivalent.

A  project  steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  will  be  established \nthe \nimplementation of the Project. The PSC will be chaired by the minister of MOPE and consist of \neight  members  including  representatives  of  MOPE,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  three \nrepresentatives  from  mahalla  committees  and  oblast  administrations  of  the  three  project \nregions. The PSC will meet quarterly, or as often as required.  \n \n64. \nThe Project will be implemented through the current ESDP PIU (or any successor hereto \nacceptable to ADB28), which will be responsible for the overall implementation of activities. The \nESDP  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  2009.  Additional  six  staff  (a  deputy  project  manager,  a \nprocurement  specialist,  a  finance  specialist,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  [M&E]  specialist,  an \nadministrative assistant, and an accountant) will be engaged to facilitate activities of the Project. \nOffice  space  for  the  PIU  will  be  provided  by  MOPE.  The  PIU  will  report  to  the project  director \nand provide quarterly progress reports to the PSC, the management of MOPE, and ADB. A joint \nimplementation plan for 2008\u20132009 for activities under the ESDP and the Project will be agreed \nupon  during  the  first  quarter  of  implementation,  and  in  coordination  with  other  ADB-funded \nprojects. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n65. \nProject Implementation Schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years from January 2008 to December 2011. A \n\n                                            \n28  The  Government  is  in  the  process  of  approving  the  center  for  coordination  of  investments  and  reforms  in  basic \neducation  under  the  MOPE,  which  will  centralize  all  PIUs  established  to  implement  investment  projects  in  the \neducation sector. Once the center  will be approved and operational, the Government  will discuss and agree  with \nthe ADB on the transfer of project staff to the new Center, which will coordinate activities under the Project. \n\n\f3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n66. \nAll ADB-financed goods and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Project  will  provide \nlaboratory  equipment,  teaching  aids,  classroom  furniture,  and  will  equip  libraries.  Equipment \nand  goods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  under  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Equipment  and  materials  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less \nwill  be  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Learning \nmaterials  and  other  equipment  and  materials  valued  at  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  by \nshopping.  The  Government  has  prepared  a  procurement  plan  for  the  initial  18  months \n(Appendix 10). The procurement plan includes (i) particular contracts for the goods, works, and \nrelated services required to carry out the Project; (ii) proposed methods for procuring contracts \npermitted under the loan agreement; and (iii) related ADB review procedures. The Government \nwill  update  the  procurement  plan  annually  or  as  needed  throughout  project  implementation. \nBefore the commencement of any procurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB \nand  the  Government  will  review  the  national  public  procurement  law/regulations  to  ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications \nwill be reflected in the procurement plan. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nAll consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \n67. \nof  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Under  the  three  project  components,  a \ntotal of 26 person-months of international consulting services and 85 person-months of national \nconsulting  services  will  be  contracted,  financed  by  ADB  funds.  International  and  national \nconsultants  financed  from  ADB  funds  under  component  2  will  be  recruited  as  a  firm  under \nquality and cost-based selection methods, using full technical proposals with 80:20 weighting29. \nIn  addition  to  consultants  contracted  through  a  firm,  the  Government  has  requested  to  recruit \none individual international consultant and one individual national consultant to support activities \nin  regard  to  promotion  of  community  participation  in  school  life.  Consulting  services  under \ncomponents  2  and  3  will  include  experts  in  the  field  of  teacher  development  and  community \nparticipation. The Government has agreed to recruit staff for the PIU in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  recruiting  individual  consultants.  In  addition,  the  Project  provides  funding  for \nengaging  national  training  providers  and  a  national  media  firm,  which  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference \nand a personnel schedule for the project consultants are in Appendix 11. \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n68. \nThe  Government  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the \nPIU\u2019s  additional  office  equipment  and  a  vehicle,  and  the  recruitment  of  PIU  staff,  including  a \ndeputy  project  manager,  financial  specialist,  office  assistant,  and  procurement  specialist.  The \nadvance contracting will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Retroactive  financing  will  apply  to  such  expenses \nincurred after ADB approval to proceed with loan negotiations for the Project until the date the \nloan  becomes  effective,  and  for  an  amount  not  exceeding  $100,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment  was  advised  that  ADB  management\u2019s  approval  of  advanced  contracting  will  not \ncommit  ADB  to  subsequently  approve  the  project  or  to  finance  the  procurement  costs,  and \nretroactive  financing  approved  by  ADB  management  in  principle  is  subject  to  approval  by  the \nBoard, and as such does not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n                                            \n29 The total score for each consultant is calculated by weighting the scores for technical quality and cost and adding \nthem. The weight for technical quality is 80% and the weight for cost is 20%. http://adb.org/Consulting/qcbs.asp \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f6.  \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n69. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MOPE  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  To  ensure  transparency  of  project\u2019s \nactivities,  MOPE\u2019s  website  will  present  information  on  the  Project  implementation  progress, \nincluding information on, among other things, (i) schools selected; (ii) teacher training programs; \nand  (iii)  procurement  activities,  including  (a)  lists  of  participating  bidders,  (b)  names  of  the \nwinning  bidders,  (c)  basic  details  on  the  adopted  bidding  procedures,  (d)  amounts  of  the \ncontracts  awarded,  (e)  the  list  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  and  (f)  their  intended  and \nactual utilization. The implementation of an awareness campaign will serve as a mean to inform \ncommunities  and  schools  of  project  activities  and  benefits,  including  sharing  information  on \ninvestments, allocation of resources, and project\u2019s beneficiaries. The communication process in \nthe  three  selected  regions  will  be  closely  monitored  during  review  missions  to  ensure \ntransparency and high involvement of schools and communities.  \n\n \n7. \n\n \n8. \n\nCapacity Building, Staff Development, and Training \n\n \n70. \nThe  Project  will  finance  national  and  international  consultants  to  design  and  conduct \ntraining  programs  to  upgrade  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  selected  staff  from  MOPE,  school \nmanagers, school boards, oblast and raion administrators and methodologists, teacher trainers \nfrom TTIs, and teachers. Training and counseling of teachers will be conducted by oblast TTIs \nand  raion  methodologists  and  financed  by  the  Government.  Facilities  of  selected  schools  and \noblast  TTIs  in  the  three  project  provinces  will  be  used  for  training  programs.  In  addition,  the \nProject  will  finance  (i)  national  training  providers  to  conduct  training  related  to  community \nparticipation,  (ii)  a  national  firm  to  conduct  awareness  measures,  and  (iii)  a  national  firm  to \nconduct  the  benchmark  survey  and  related  monitoring  activities.  MOPE  will  prepare  the \nselection  criteria  for  training  providers  and  firms  for  ADB  approval.  The  PIU  will  provide  ADB \nwith  a  list  of  potential  training  providers  and  firms,  and  detailed  costing  of  the  proposed \nmeasures. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n71. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  to \nexpedite disbursement of the project funds. The PIU will open the account in a commercial bank \nselected  by  the  Government,  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  $100,000.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed \nestimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  for  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nlower. \n \n72. \nStatement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures \nunder  ADB-financed  activities  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account,  in \naccordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.  Each  individual  payment  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  procedures  will  not \nexceed $20,000 equivalent for each item of expenditure. \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n73.  Mope,  as  the  EA,  will  maintain  the  project  accounts  and  prepare  financial  statements \naccording  to  international  accounting  standards.  MOPE  will  have  the  project  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nCertified copies of the audited project accounts and audited financial statements (including the \nauditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  compliance  with  covenants,  and  the  use  of  the \nimprest  account  and  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures)  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  in \nEnglish not later than 6 months after the end of each financial year. \n \n74. \nThe PIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation to be approved by the \nPSC and submit them to ADB within 30 days after the end of each quarter. Reports will be in a \nform  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  indicate,  among  other  matters,  (i)  progress  made  against \nestablished targets, (ii) problems and constraints encountered during the last quarter, (iii) steps \ntaken  and  proposed  to  be  taken  to  resolve  problems,  (iv)  compliance  with  covenants,  and  (v) \nthe proposed program of activities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after completion \nof the Project, the PIU will submit a project completion report to ADB providing details on project \nimplementation, accomplishments, costs, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nThe  Government  is  preparing  a  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  in \n75. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s current PPMS guidelines30. In addition to the performance targets and \nindicators specified in the project design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), the Project will \ndevelop  a  monitoring  mechanism  to  (i) assess  whether  new  teaching  equipment  is  fully \nintegrated  into  curriculum  and  lesson  plans  and  utilized  by  teachers  and  students,  (ii)  review \nwhether managers and teachers trained under the Project apply their new knowledge and skills, \n(iii)  evaluate  project  impacts  on  the  participation  of  disabled  students  and  students  from  poor \nfamilies, and (iv) monitor and evaluate gender equality in all project-related activities to measure \ncontribution  towards  achieving  gender  equality.  Monitoring  results  will  be  used  to  adjust  the \nannual  implementation  plans.  Jointly  with  qualified  NGOs,  a  system  will  be  established  to \nmonitor  drop-out  and  attendance  rates  in  rural  schools.  Feedback  from  parents  and  teachers \nwill  be  collected  to  review  whether  improved  learning  environments  have  resulted  in  better \nlearning  achievements.  Rehabilitation  works  will  be  monitored  by  MOPE  and  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to the PSC and ADB on an annual basis. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n76. \nADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \nreviews will assess progress on each component, identify issues and constraints, and determine \nnecessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted at the end of \nthe  second  year  of  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  identify  adjustments  required;  (ii)  assess  progress  of  the \nproject  implementation  against  performance  indicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the \ndesign or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n77. \nProject Benefits and Impacts. Restructuring and modernizing the education system is \na top priority in the Government\u2019s reform agenda. The NPBED investment of $1.2 billion is the \n\n                                            \n30 ADB. 2007. Guidelines for Preparing a Design and Monitoring Framework. Manila \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nkey  strategy  to  remove  disparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools,  and  strengthen  basic \neducation  to  meet  international  standards.  The  Project  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategic thrust, creating equal opportunities for all students. About 670,000 students enrolled in \nschools supported by the Project and about 63,000 teachers will benefit from upgraded school \nfacilities  in  the  three  project  regions.  Improved  learning  environments  and  modern  teaching \ntechniques will improve opportunities for graduates from basic education schools to progress to \nhigher  levels  of  education  employment  and  enhance  their  income-earning  opportunities  at  a \nlater stage. Assuming that around 30% of the population is considered to be poor, and that 70% \nof  low-income  families  live  in  rural  areas,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  enhancing  income \nopportunities of the students from poor families enrolled in rural basic schools. In addition, at the \nend of the project duration, it is assumed that at least 4,000 school board members and parents \nwill benefit from training under component 3. About 45,000 grade 5\u20139 teachers will benefit from \nnew teacher training programs. Approximately 1,600 school managers will benefit from training \nunder  the  Project.  Further,  about  450  methodologists,  administrators,  and  teacher  trainers  will \nbenefit  from  training  programs  under  components  2  and  3.  Communities  will  benefit  from \nupgraded  schools  with  active  school  boards  and  the  use  of  school  facilities  for  adult  learning \nand extra-curriculum activities and social events. \n \n78. \nTo  improve  gender  responsiveness,  the  Project  will  develop  strategies  for  teacher \ntraining to address gender stereotypes in curriculum and material development. The Project was \ndesigned through a participatory process involving key government stakeholders at the national, \noblast,  and  raion  levels,  civil  society  groups,  and  parents.  During  implementation,  the  Project \nwill maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities. Involvement of communities in the \nschool selection process will contribute to the maintenance of a participatory approach. \n \n79. \nNew teacher training modules and training approaches developed under the Project and \ntested in the project schools will be incorporated into the national in-service training system and \nbenefit  all  grade  5\u20139  teachers  engaged  in  basic  education.  Successful  experiences  of  school \nboards will be replicated in other schools in Uzbekistan. \n \n80. \nSustainability.  It  can  be  assumed  that  the  project  activities  are  sustainable.  The \nGovernment  is  strongly  committed  to  further  improve  the  current  education  system.  Budget \nprojections  indicate  that  basic  education  funding  will  rise  during  the  period  2008\u20132012.  The \nmajor  share  of  increases  is  committed  to  further  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  schools  and  lift \nteacher remuneration. All project activities will be implemented through existing structures of the \neducation sector, and thus they will become an integral part of the normal plan of activities. The \nGovernment\u2019s  contribution  to  the  Project  in  terms  of  civil  works  for  school  rehabilitation,  O&M \ncosts  for  rehabilitated  schools,  duties,  contingencies,  and  interest  charges  is  included  in  the \nbudget, and an estimated at $13.0 million over 4 years. This will be less than 0.5% of the annual \ntotal  expenditure  on  education.  Further,  the  Government  has  confirmed  its  commitment  to \nincrease  allocations  for  O&M  of  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  school  facilities  under  the  Project. \nADB-financed provision of equipment, training, and other resources to schools will not result in \nsizable maintenance expenditures, and thus implications for the recurrent education budget are \ninsignificant.  Enhanced  community  participation  will  result  in  additional  support  (cash  and  in-\nkind),  thus  reducing  dependency  on  public  allocations  for  maintenance  expenditures.  Budget \nprojections  confirm  that  sufficient  funds  will  be  available  to  implement  teacher  development \nprograms in the project regions.31 \n\n                                            \n31To  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with  increased  budget  needs,  ADB  will  conduct  a  study  to  assess  and  suggest    \n\nimproved approaches to education financing and sector efficiency. \n\n\fEnvironmental  and  Social  Safeguards.  ADB  funding  will  not  be  used  for  civil  works. \n81. \nThere  will  be  no  land  acquisition  required  and  no  negative  environmental  or  resettlement \nimpact. Some school rehabilitation works, financed by Government funds, will include improved \nwater supply and sanitation and sewage systems, which will promote good health and have a \npositive  environmental  impact.  Reading  materials  and  teacher  guides  provided  under  the \nProject  will  consider  ethnic  minority  languages.  Furthermore,  it  was  agreed  that  school \nmanagements  will  provide  plans  on  (i)  proper  waste  treatment;  (ii)  training  programs  for \nstudents  and  science  teachers  on  proper  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous  and  toxic \nmaterials, and other safety measures in the laboratory; and (iii) regular emergency drills in order \nrespond  to  fire  and  chemical  spills.  Teacher  training  courses  will  be  held  in  local  minority \nlanguages  of  instruction;  teacher  trainers  will  be  trained  accordingly  by  the  TTIs.  Based  on \ndemand, resources will be allocated for teacher training courses in minority languages.   \n \n82. \nAssumptions. Successful implementation of the Project assumes that the Government \nwill  (i)  maintain  the  budget  allocation  for  basic  education  as  indicated,  (ii)  be  committed  to \nmodernizing  the  education  system,  (iii)  provide  adequate  funding  to  finance  in-service  training \nas planned, and (iv) provide sufficient funds for O&M to rehabilitated and upgraded schools.  \n \n83. \nRisks.  At  present,  managerial  and  technical  capacity  at  all  levels  within  the  education \nsystem  is  limited  and  might  affect  the  smooth  implementation  of  reforming  the  education \nsystem. This risk will be mitigated through training measures for teachers and managers at rural \nschools  and  relevant  staff  of  raion  administrations  and  TTIs  under  the  Project,  and  other \ncapacity-building activities under ADB-financed projects.  \n \nFinancial risks involve potential difficulties in the provision of recurrent costs for O&M of \n84. \nupgraded schools. During project implementation, ADB will work closely with the Government to \nensure  adequate  resource  allocation  for  the  education  sector  and  incremental  recurrent  costs \nfor  O&M.  Appropriate  assurances  are  included  in  the  project  design.  In  addition,  the  Project\u2019s \nstrategy aims at reducing the dependency on public allocations by promoting income generation \nat the school level.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n85. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Agreement,  the \nGovernment  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  into  the  legal \ndocuments. \n \nCounterpart Funding. The Government shall maintain annual expenditure for education \n86. \nsector activities during project implementation at not less than 7.5% of GDP. Throughout project \nimplementation, the Government will allocate and release in a timely manner adequate budget \nfunding for (i) constructing and/or rehabilitating schools during 2007\u20132009, (ii) supporting \nteacher  training  programs,  (iii)  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  O&M  of  schools \nsupported under the Project, and (iv) interest charges. Throughout project implementation, \nthe Government will provide ADB with information on allocations and actual expenditures for the \nbasic  education  system  and  specifically  for  Project  schools  through  submission  of  annual \nreports, in a form acceptable to ADB.   \n\n87. \nSchool Selection Criteria and Process. The Government will ensure that selection of \nschools  under  the  Project  is  carried  out  based  on  the  agreed  criteria  and  a  competitive  two-\nstage  process  as  described  in  Appendix  7.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  all  selected \nschools (i) prior to 31  December 2008, develop plans on proper waste treatment  and develop \ntraining programs for proper handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic materials, and other \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\fsafety  measures  in  the  science  laboratories;  (ii)  throughout  project  implementation,  conduct \nregular fire and chemical spills drills in accordance with Government\u2019s environmental and health \nand  safety  laws  and  regulations.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  based  on  demand,  \neducation  and  reading  materials  and  teacher  training  courses  under  the  project  are  also \nprovided in the languages of the ethnic minorities. \n    \n88.    Teacher Development. The Government shall ensure that the in-service teacher training \nmodel  is  integrated  in  the  national  in-service  teacher  training  system  by  31  December  2010.  \nSuch in-service teacher training model shall focus on the specific needs of teachers taking into \nconsideration the working conditions in rural areas to ensure full participation of rural teachers in \ntraining opportunities. \n\n  \n89.   Construction  and  Rehabilitation  of  Schools.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  schools  under  NPBED  is  completed  by  1  September  2010. \nThe  Government  will  also  ensure  that  all  civil  works  under  the  Project  (a)  are  carried  out  in \naccordance with the national environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995);  and  (b)  do  not \nrequire any land acquisition.  For the avoidance of doubt, any construction for the Project will be \ncarried out only on unoccupied and unused public land. \n \n90. \nProject  Performance  Management  System.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  within \n3 months of the loan effectiveness, the PIU establishes the PPMS to monitor progress of project \nimplementation  and  evaluate  project  impacts  based  on  the  key  baseline  indicators  agreed \nbetween MOPE and ADB. \n \n91. \nTransparency  and  Anticorruption.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents; (ii) all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project;  and  (iii)  an  audit  of \nprocurement activities is carried out at least twice during project implementation. The cost of the \naudit will be financed by the Project provided that the auditor is selected though a competitive \nprocess and has qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to ADB.  \n \n92. \nThe  Government  will  establish,  within  6  months  from  loan  effectiveness,  a  dedicated \nwebpage  on  the  MOPE\u2019s  website  which  will  present  information  on  the  project  progress, \nincluding  information  on,  among  other  things,  schools  selected  under  the  Project,  teacher \ntraining programs, and procurement activities, including the list of participating bidders, names \nof  the  winning  bidders,  basic  details  on  the  adopted  bidding  procedures,  amounts  of  the \ncontracts  awarded,  the  list  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  and  their  intended  and  actual \nutilization. \n \n93. \nEffectiveness  Conditions.  Prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  engage \nadditional six staff for PIU, including a deputy project manager, a procurement specialist, \na finance specialist, a monitoring and evaluation specialist, an administrative assistant, \nand  an  accountant.  The  deputy  project  manager  to  be  recruited  and  appointed  for  the \nProject should be acceptable to ADB. \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\fVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n94. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  19,122,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for \nthe Rural Basic Education Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in

\n\n \n1. \nWith  net  enrolment  and  literacy  rates  both  estimated  at  over  99%  and  no  significant \ngender  differentials  in  primary  education,  Uzbekistan  scores  high  on  the  two  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating gender disparity in \nprimary and secondary education. The Constitution of Uzbekistan stipulates that all citizens are \nentitled to free general education. \n \n2. \nIn 2004, the Government made a decision to extend the schooling period by 1 year and \nestablish a compulsory 12-year education system gradually by 2009. After completion of basic \neducation  (grade  9),  students  will  either  continue  with  a  3-year  senior  secondary  education \n(SSE) course at academic lyceums, or enroll in professional colleges, which will offer a 3-year \nprogram  combining  a  vocational  specialty  with  general  education.  This  will  also  provide  the \nqualification to enroll in higher education institutions after graduation. Thus, by 2009 across the \ncountry, the reformed education system will comprise (i) preschooling, (ii) primary education of \ngrades 1\u20134, (iii) secondary education of grades 5\u20139, (iv) SSE of grades 10\u201312, and (v) higher \neducation.  \n\n \n\nFigure A2.1: The Formal Education System in Uzbekistan \n\nAge \n\nGrade \n\nType \n\nLevel\n\nPost-graduate \nand Doctoral  \nStudies \nMasters \nProgram \n\nBachalors \nProgram \n\nProfessional\nPrograms \n(Medicine up to \n12 years)\n\nPost-graduate \nEducation\n\n\u21d2 Doctor of Science ( Doktor Nauk ) \n\u21d2 Candidate of Science ( Kandidat Nauk)\n\n\u21d2 Maters Degree Diploma \n\n\u21d2 Bachalors Degree Diploma \n\nHigher Education\n\nAcademic \nLyceum \n\nProfessional\nCollege\n\nSenior Secondary \nSpecialized \nVocational Education\n\n\u21d2 Graduation Certificate for Academic Lyceums\n\nDiploma for Professional Colleges \n\n\u21d2 Certificate (Attestat ) \n\n25 \n24 \n23 \n22 \n21 \n20 \n19 \n18 \n17 \n16 \n15 \n14 \n13 \n12 \n11 \n10 \n9 \n8 \n7 \n3\u20136 \n\n19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\nG 12 \nG 11 \nG 10 \nG 9 \nG 8 \nG 7 \nG 6 \nG 5 \nG 4 \nG 3 \nG 2 \nG 1 \n\nSecondary School\n\nPrimary School \n\nBasic (General) \nEducation\n\nNursery/Kindergarten\n\nPreschool\n\nCompulsory Education\n\n \nSource: Ministry of Public Education. \n \nIn order to support the restructure of the education system into a 12-year school system, \n3. \nthe  Government  launched  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education  Development  (NPBED) \n2004\u20132009,  which  aims  to  strengthen  basic  education  to  meet  international  standards  and \nremove disparities between rural and urban schools, thereby creating equal opportunities for all \nstudents. The NPBED promotes reforms in the basic education system by (i) providing financial \nsupport  to  improve  the  physical  school  conditions  through  construction  and  rehabilitation  of \nbuildings and facilities; (ii) equipping all basic schools with new laboratories, modern computer \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nrooms,  furniture,  and  teaching  aids;  (iii)  providing  free  textbooks  and  educational  materials  to \nteachers;  (iv)  improving  education  standards,  (v)  reviewing  and  modernizing  the  curriculum \nframework;  (vi)  ensuring  that  rural  areas  are  provided  with  highly  qualified  teaching  staff;  (vii) \nintroducing  new  student-centered  teaching  approaches;  (viii)  increasing  teacher  incentives  to \nwork  in  the  more  deprived  areas;  and  (ix)  developing  sports  activities  in  schools  through  the \nprovision of sports equipment to all basic schools. The investment costs of the program, which \nare estimated at $1.2 billion, are being financed by a combination of 75% budget financing, 20% \nforeign  investment  financing,  and  5%  local  donor  contributions.  Major  investments  include \nschool construction and rehabilitation, and significant salary increases for teachers and school \nprincipals  in  order  to  improve  incentives  and  entice  qualified  university  graduates  to  become \nteachers. \n  \n4. \nIn  order  to  implement  the  NPBED,  the  School  Development  Fund  (SDF)  was \nestablished. Its main objectives are to accumulate sufficient funds to finance civil works for the \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  schools  and  provide  a  minimum  package  of  furniture  and \nlaboratory,  library,  computers,  and  sports  equipment.  The  SDF  is  financed  by  a  1%  tax  on \nenterprise  revenues  and  by  contributions  from  donors,  local  sponsors,  and  local  government. \nAlthough  under  the  program  many  schools  have  been  successfully  rehabilitated,  Government \ncapacity to meet all school rehabilitation needs, provide much-needed new classroom furniture, \nand  upgrade  laboratory  equipment  and  teaching  aids  nationally  is  limited.  Thus,  the \nGovernment  will  partially  depend  on  external  assistance  to  successfully  implement  the \nambitious reform program. \n \n5. \nThe  main  education  policy-making  bodies  are  the  Office  of  the  President  and  the \nCabinet  of  Ministers.  While  basic  education  (grades  1\u20139)  is  administered  by  the  Ministry  of \nPublic  Education  (MOPE),  academic  lyceums,  professional  colleges,  and  universities  are  the \nresponsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Senior  Secondary  and  Higher  Education  (MOSSHE).  MOPE  is \nresponsible  for  formulating  strategies  to  implement  education  policies,  setting  standards  in \ngeneral education, teacher training, curriculum, and textbook development, and administers the \nprovision  of  general  education  through  oblast  (province)  and  raion  (district)  departments  of \neducation and schools. In 2004, the Government restructured the functions and tasks of MOPE \nand  MOSSHE  and  its associated  institutions  at  the  national  and  the  oblast levels to  make  the \nsystem more responsive and relevant to the requirements of a market economy. \n \n6. \nPreschool  Education.  Preschool  education  covers  students  up  to  the  age  of  7.  Since \n1991 the number of preschool educational institutions has decreased by one third, from 9,834 \nschools in 1991 to 6,603 in 2005. Preschool enrollments have declined by 57% over the same \nperiod, from 1.339 million to 575,000, and the number of preschool teachers has dropped from \n104,000 to 63,700 (a drop of 39%). During the Soviet period kindergartens were funded by state \nenterprises,  however  after  independence  many  of  them  closed  or  could  no  longer  afford  to \nprovide  preschool  facilities  for  their  workers.  In  an  attempt  to  compensate  for  the  closure  of \npreschool  facilities,  in  1997  the  Government  increased  the  right  to  maternity  leave  to  3  years, \nand  mothers  were  provided  with  financial  support  for  their  children  in  the  form  of  child \nallowances  until  the  age  of  2.  These  allowances  currently  are  paid  through  mahallas  (village \ncommittees).

Basic  education  starts  at  the  age  of  7.  With  the  introduction  of  the \n7. \nnew 12-year school system by 2009, the current basic education system is being restructured \ninto  primary  education  (grades  1\u20134)  and  junior  secondary  education  (grades  5\u20139).  Previously, \njunior secondary education also included grade 10. The curriculum framework has been revised \nto  respond  to  the  structural  change,  and  teacher  development  programs  are  adjusted \naccordingly.  Table  A2.2  provides  information  on  students  and  teachers,  showing  gender \ndistribution by grades in urban and rural areas. As the transformation is currently ongoing in line \nwith  the  construction  of  new  SSE  schools,  reliable  statistics  for  the  school  year  2005\u20132006 \nproviding  information  on  grade  12  enrollments  and  teacher  numbers  within  the  newly  forming \nSSE system are not yet available. In the school year 2004\u20132005 there was 449,200 teachers, of \nwhich 115,700 taught in urban schools and 333,500 in rural schools. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n  \n\n \n\nItem  \n\nStudents \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\n \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\nTotal \n\nSpecial schools \n\nTable A2.2: Student Enrollments and Teachers, 2003\u20132004 and 2004\u20132005 \n \n\n2003\u20132004 School Year \n\n2004\u20132005 School Year \n\nStudents \n(\u2018000) \n\nF \n\n \n\nM \n\n \n\n% of Total \n\nF \n\n \n\nM \n\n \n\n%, by \nGender \n\nF \n\n \n\nM \n\n \n\nStudents \n(\u2018000) \n\nF \n\n \n\nM \n\n \n\n% of Total \n\nF \n\n \n\nM \n\n \n\n%, by \nGender \n\nF \n\n \n\nM \n\n \n\n937.0 \n\n1018.4  100.0  100.0  47.9 \n\n52.1 \n\n909.3 \n\n996.3  100.0  100.0  47.7  52.3 \n\n2,092.0 \n\n2174.1  100.0  100.0  47.7 \n\n52.3  2,072.0  2,152.9  100.0  100.0  49.0  51.0 \n\n38.9 \n\n40.8 \n\n38.0 \n\n51.4 \n\n53.1 \n\n50.7 \n\n9.5 \n\n5.5 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.1 \n\n38.9  48.6  51.4 \n\n39.9  48.3  51.7 \n\n38.4  48.8  51.2 \n\n51.1  48.8  51.2 \n\n52.5  48.0  52.0 \n\n50.5  49.1  50.9 \n\n9.6  48.2  51.2 \n\n6.6  43.0  57.0 \n\n0.4  35.1  64.9 \n\n1.0  35.8  64.2 \n\n0.1  31.3  68.7 \n\n39.4 \n\n41.2 \n\n38.6 \n\n50.6 \n\n52.3 \n\n49.8 \n\n10.0 \n\n6.5 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.1 \n\n61.2 \n\n78 \n\n7.0 \n\n6.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n12.2 \n\n9.9 \n\n2.3 \n\n \n\n \n\nStudents in Grades 1\u20134 \n\n1,193.7 \n\n1257.4 \n\n385.7 \n\n808.0 \n\n411.6 \n\n845.8 \n\n39.4  48.7 \n\n40.4  48.3 \n\n38.9  48.9 \n\n51.3 \n\n51.7 \n\n51.1 \n\n1159.4  1,223.9 \n\n371.1 \n\n788.3 \n\n397.4 \n\n826.5 \n\nStudents in Grades 5\u20139 \n\n1,532.7 \n\n1609.8 \n\n50.4  48.8 \n\n51.2  1,533.3  1,609.9 \n\n490.1 \n\n528.8 \n\n51.9  48.1 \n\n51.9 \n\n482.8 \n\n522.7 \n\n1,042.6 \n\n1,081.0 \n\n49.7  49.1 \n\n50.9  1,050.5  1,087.2 \n\nStudents in Grades 10\u201311 \n\n302.7 \n\n325.3 \n\n281.8 \n\n302.8 \n\n241.5 \n\n247.3 \n\n11.6 \n\n11.4  49.4 \n\n11.2 \n\n11.0  49.5  50.5 \n\n10.2  48.2 \n\n7.7  44.0 \n\n0.4  36.6 \n\n1.0  37.6 \n\n0.1  31.9 \n\n51.8 \n\n56.0 \n\n50.6 \n\n63.4 \n\n62.4 \n\n68.1 \n\n49.6 \n\n232.2 \n\n6.8 \n\n5.8 \n\n1.0 \n\n65.8 \n\n237 \n\n12.6 \n\n10.4 \n\n2.2 \n\nTotal students \n\n3,029.1 \n\n3,192.5  100.0  100.0  48.7 \n\n51.3  2,981.3  3,149.2  100.0  100.0  48.6  51.4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFull-Time Teachers \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n94.0 \n\n201.4 \n\n295.4 \n\n24.5 \n\n131.9 \n\n31.8 \n\n68.2 \n\n15.6  79.3 \n\n84.4  60.4 \n\n156.4  100.0  100.0  65.4 \n\n20.7 \n\n39.5 \n\n34.6 \n\n89.3 \n\n206.4 \n\n295.7 \n\n26.4 \n\n127.1 \n\n30.2 \n\n69.8 \n\n17.2  77.2  22.8 \n\n82.8  61.9  38.1 \n\n153.5  100.0  100.0  65.8  34.2 \n\nF = female, M = male. \nSource: Gender Equality in Uzbekistan, State Statistics Committee, 2005. \n\n \n8. \nSenior Secondary Education. The SSE system is currently in a transition period from a \n2-year system into a compulsory 3-year system. By 2009, students who completed grade 9 at \nbasic  education  schools  will  either  continue  for  3  years  at  academic  lyceums,  or  enroll  in \nprofessional colleges, which will provide a 3-year program combining a vocational specialty with \ngeneral  education.  In  the  school  year  2006\u20132007,  about  919,400  students  were  enrolled  in \n1,055 SSE institutions. It is projected that in school year 2009\u20132010 about 1.6 million students \nwill be enrolled in SSE institutions (assuming 100% coverage of grade 9 graduates). In order to \nprovide  adequate  classroom  and  training  facilities,  the  Government  plans  to  establish  176 \nacademic  lyceums  and  1,691  vocational  colleges  by  2009.  Based  on  a  broad  review  of  all \nexisting SSE institutions, rehabilitation and construction works started in 2004. The number of \nSSE  institutions  has  been  increased  from  869  in  2004  to  1,055  in  2006.  The  Government \nconfirmed  that  additional  funding  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  provision  of \nconsumables for training workshops will be included in the SSE budget. In order to improve the \nquality and relevance of SSE education, curriculum modules for skills training are being revised \nin  close  cooperation  with  industry,  and  strategies  to  improve  the  in-service  training  system  for \nvocational teachers are being reviewed. \n \n9. \nHigher  Education.  The  higher  education  system  comprises  undergraduate  (bachelor) \nprograms of 4 years, postgraduate (master\u2019s) programs of 2 years, and doctorate programs of \n3\u20136  years  (depending  on  the  field  of  research).  The  higher  education  subsector  currently \ncomprises  64  institutions  with  an  estimated  enrollment  of  more  than  260,000  students.  Thirty-\nfour  higher  education  institutions  are  administered  by  MOSSHE,  with  about  54,000  students \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nenrolled  in  the  2006\u20132007  school  year.  In  2004  women  represented  only  40%  of  the  total \nenrollment  in  higher  education  (Table  A2.3).  Women  are  significantly  underrepresented  in \ntechnical and science courses and their subject choices tend to be concentrated on educational, \nsocial, and health-related disciplines. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Total Higher Education Enrollment by Gender: 2000\u20132005 \n\n38.9 \n61.1 \n \n\n% \n38.7 \n61.3 \n \n\n% \n37.8 \n62.2 \n \n\n2000\u20132001 \nNo. \n69,400 \n114,200 \n183,600 \n\n2001\u20132002 \nNo. \n80,100 \n127,100 \n207,200 \n\n2002\u20132003 \n% \nNo. \n90,400 \n141,900 \n232,300 \n\n2004\u20132005 \n% \nNo. \n40.7 \n107,300 \n59.3 \n156,300 \n \n263,600 \n\n2003\u20132004 \n% \nNo. \n36.9 \n98,800 \n63.1 \n155,600 \n \n254,400 \n\n \n \nStudents \nFemale  \nMale \nTotal  \nSource: Ministry of Senior Secondary and Higher Education, 2006. \n \nChallenges for Basic Education. The Government has demonstrated continued strong \n10. \ncommitment  to  reform  of  the  education  sector,  completing  the  transition  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \neducation  system  from  the  Soviet  model  to  a  system  that  is  consistent  with  internationally \naccepted  requirements.  In  line  with  the  restructuring  of  the  school  system,  fundamental  policy \nreforms in the organization, management, staffing, and financing of the education sector have \nbeen  introduced.  However,  capacities  of  MOPE  at  national  level  are  limited  and  need  to  be \nfurther strengthened in order to further improve effectiveness and efficiency in the sector. MOPE \nneeds  to  build  additional  capacity  in  strategic  planning,  policy  analysis,  research,  and  impact-\noriented  monitoring.  At  present,  an  effective  planning  structure  is  not  in  place,  due  partly  to \nlimited  qualified  staff  and  because  data  collected  are  not  subjected  to  systematic  analyses. \nAlthough  data  is  regularly  collected  from  all  levels,  it  appears  that  it  is  not  directly  used  for \nplanning and decision making. The current education management information system is poorly \nmaintained and inefficient to monitor education quality. \n \n11. \n \n\nThe following are the key issues in rural basic education.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nPoor  school  facilities  and  disparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools  as \nrevealed by the 2004 school mapping survey. This issue is being addressed \nby  comprehensive  rehabilitation  works  under  the  NPBED  program.  Major \ninvestments of the proposed Project will be utilized for upgrading rural schools to \ncomplement the Government efforts to raise education standards in rural areas. \nMore information on school facilities is provided in Appendix 3. \n\nOutdated  teaching  skills  and  knowledge.  Teaching  techniques  and  subject \nknowledge of many teachers are considered inadequate and outdated and need \nto be upgraded and aligned with the revised curriculum. Most teachers still apply \ntraditional  teaching  methods,  devoting  attention  mostly  to  narrow  subject \nknowledge,  requiring  students  to  memorize  and  repeat  notions  and  definitions. \nCritical  thinking,  problem  solving,  communication  skills,  and  teamwork  do  not \nreceive  sufficient  attention.  Although  training  programs  for  teachers  have  been \nrevised  by  MOPE  in  2005,  the  current  in-service  training  system  needs  to  be \nmore flexible to adjust to specific subject-related requirements of teachers in rural \nschools,  who  work  under  difficult  circumstances.  At  present,  the  majority  of  in-\nservice  training  curricula  for  all  subject  areas  are  developed  by  the  Central \nRepublican  In-Service  Teacher  Training  Institute.  Based  on  these  curricula  the \nprovincial teacher training institutes (TTIs) develop training courses for teachers. \nUnder the existing in-service system, teachers are required to participate in a 24-\nday  training  every  3  years.  This  combines  residential  training  at  the  provincial \nTTI,  followed  by  practice  activities  at  their  home  school.  In-service  training  for \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nnewly  assigned  teachers  consist  of  18  days  residential  training  followed  by  6 \ndays  practice  at  their  home  schools;  in-service  training  for  other  teachers \nconsists of 12 days residential training followed by 12 days practice at their home \nschools. Feedback from teachers revealed that most in-service training modules, \nas currently drafted, are too general in nature, too theoretical in orientation, and \ninsufficiently  grounded  in  the  practical  conditions  teachers  have  to  cope  with, \nparticularly in rural schools. There is also a need for improvement of instructional \ndesign process standards. Currently statements of goals and objectives often do \nnot  provide  sufficient  specific  information;  new  teaching  methodologies  to  be \nintroduced  need  to  be  explained  through  constant  references  to,  and  examples \nfrom,  the  subject  areas  to  be  taught;  and  the  language  and  format  of  training \nmodules  need  to  be  simplified  so  that  they  can  be  understood  easily  by  both \ntrainers  and  teachers.  Guidance  provided  to  teachers  during  their  practice \nactivities  at  their  home  schools  is  weak.  Due  to  the  lack  of  a  monitoring \nmechanism,  no  feedback  is  available  to  assess  whether  new  teaching methods \nand  knowledge  is  applied  in  the  classrooms  after  completion  of  in-service \ntraining.  Field  visits  revealed  the  dominance  of  the  textbook  as  a  teaching-\nlearning  material  in  the  classroom.  It  is  recommended  to  broaden  the  range  of \nteaching-learning  materials,  including  books,  and  other  reading  materials.  The \nintegration  between  curriculum \ntextbook \nrevision, \ndevelopment also needs to be strengthened. \n\ntraining,  and \n\nteacher \n\nCurriculum modernization. The current curriculum is overloaded with subjects \nand  content  requirements  with  insufficient  emphasis  on  modern  learning \nmethodologies,  and  these  are  no  longer  consistent  with  the  need  for  greater \nflexibility  in  subject  selection  and  a  student-centered  teaching  environment. \nMOPE has started the process of revising the curriculum framework. If curriculum \nreform is to have the desired impact, immediate steps must be taken to bring in-\nservice  teacher  training  and  textbook  development  into  line  with  a  reformed \ncurriculum  framework.  To  accomplish  this,  the  training  of  teacher  trainers  is  an \nindispensable  step.  Textbooks  must  be  revised  to  incorporate  the  principles \nunderlying  the  new  curriculum  and  to  reflect  its  teaching  methodologies.  While \nthe  full  synchronization  of  curriculum,  teacher  training,  and  textbooks  will  take \nconsiderable time, a short- and long-term plan of action for its achievement must \nbe  put  in  place.  The  ADB-funded  STDP  provides  assistance  to  modernize  the \ncurriculum  framework  and  strengthen  textbook  development  and  learning \nassessment  \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nFigure A2.2: Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n \n\n \n\nED = education department, HR = human resources, ICT = information and communications technology. \nSource: Ministry of Public Education. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSCHOOL FACILITIES  \n \n\nlibrary \n\nlaboratory  and \n\nincluding  classrooms, \n\n1. \nSituational Analysis of Basic Education School Facilities. About 80% of Uzbekistan\u2019s \n9,773  basic  schools  are  located  in  rural  areas.  In  2004,  a  comprehensive  school  survey  was \ncarried  out  to  review  (i)  school  capacities;  (ii)  actual  enrollments,  (iii)  the  overall  condition  of \nrooms,  workshops,  and \nschool  buildings \ngymnasiums;  (iv)  state  of  utilities  and  sanitary  facilities;  and  (v)  the  quantity  and  condition  of \nschool  furniture  and  sports  equipment.  The  survey  revealed  that  out  of  the  9,727  schools \ncovered  by  the  study,  684  schools were  considered  in  very  poor  condition  requiring  emergency \nrepairs, and more than 90% were in poor condition requiring major rehabilitation and repairs. The \nclassroom  capacity  of  schools  was  not  in  line  with  the  growing  number  of  students;  about  1.7 \nmillion or 28% of students were studying in 2\u20133 shift schools. \n \nThe  majority  of  schools  were  constructed  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  and  have  seriously \n2. \ndeteriorated  as  a  consequence  of  severe  weather  conditions,  continuous  use,  and  poor \nmaintenance  due  to  years  of  underfunding  since  1991.  The  deterioration  of  the  school  facilities \nhas  been  further  exacerbated  by  the  poor  construction  technology  and  inferior  quality  of \nconstruction  materials  used.  Common  defects are  leaking roofs,  water  infiltration  to  the  building \nstructures,  damaged  and  leaking  windows  and  doors,  defective  wooden  floors,  malfunctioning \nsanitary and plumbing facilities, broken heating systems, and leaking water supply systems. Most \nclassroom  furniture  is in  very  poor  condition. Many  schools  have  no heating  and  sanitary  water \nsupply facilities. About 71% of the schools have no basic science laboratory equipment and about \n85% of the schools have no modern computers.  \n  \n3. \nThe survey also revealed great disparities between urban and rural schools in the quality \nof  school  facilities,  allotment  of  teachers,  and  allocation  and  quality  of  materials,  teaching \nequipment, and furniture. Urban schools are better equipped in almost every respect. \n \nSchool Mapping System. To make efficient use of the voluminous data collected from \n4. \nschools, the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) established a computerized school mapping \nsystem to process approximately 1,400 indicators generated from the survey forms. The system \nis  currently  being  administered  by  the  information  and  communication  technology  unit \nestablished under the office of the deputy minister of MOPE, and staffed by an information and \ncommunication technology specialist and two support staff. In order to ensure regular update of \nschool  data,  in  2006  the  information  gathering  was  decentralized  to  the  oblast  (province)  and \nraion  (district)  levels.  The  MOPE  oblast  departments  are  responsible  for  electronically \nsubmitting quarterly updated information of all schools in their province.  \n \n5. \nfor  Basic  Education \nDevelopment  (NPBED).  Addressing  the  issue  of  poor  school  facilities,  8,476  schools  have \nbeen selected to be upgraded under the NPBED by 2009. Government data indicates that 3,061 \nschools  had  been  rehabilitated  by  2006.  In  2007,  a  total  of  60  new  schools  are  planned  for \nconstruction  and  1,591  schools  are  programmed  for  rehabilitation.  In  2008,  the  Government \nplans to construct 64 new basic education schools and upgrade the physical facilities of 1,805 \nexisting  schools.  In  2009,  61  new  basic  education  schools  will  be  built  and  1,843  existing \nschools  will  be  upgraded.  The  planned  civil  works  under  the  NPBED  are  presented  in  Table \nA3.1. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSchool  Rehabilitation  Under \n\nthe  National  Program \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n2007 \n\n2008 \n2009 \nTotal \n\nTable A3.1: Civil Works under National Program for Basic Education Development \n \n\nNew \nConstruction \n60 \n\nScope of Civil Works \nMajor \nRepair \n729 \n\nMajor/Capital \nReconstruction \n490 \n\nCurrent \nRepair \n372 \n\n64 \n61 \n\n558 \n591 \n\n \n\n817  \n825 \n\n430 \n427 \n\nTotal \n\n1,651 \n\n1869 \n1,904 \n5,424 \n\n \n\nStatus \nUnder \nimplementation \nPlanned \nPlanned \n\n \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates based on Ministry of Public Education data. \n \n6. \nLow  Provision  of  Science  Laboratory  Equipment  to  Upgraded  Schools.  While \nphysical  rehabilitation  is  progressing,  field  visits  to  rural  schools  revealed  that  additional \nresources  are  required  to  provide  laboratory  equipment,  furniture,  teaching  aids,  and  reading \nmaterials  to  all  rehabilitated  schools.  MOPE  data  indicates  that  by  2006,  out  of  3,061 \nrehabilitated  schools,  only  1,387  schools  had  received  the  complete  package  of  science \nlaboratory  equipment  with  teaching  aids  for  chemistry  and  physics,  and  1,506  schools  had \nreceived equipment packages for biology. Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing under the \nproposed Project will help the Government to comprehensively upgrade the schools covered by \nthe NPBED. \n\n7. \nLow  Utilization  of  New  Laboratory  Equipment.  Field  visits  revealed  that  teachers \nneed  urgent  assistance  to  utilize  new  science  equipment  in  classroom  lessons  for  practical \nexperiments.  It  was  noted  that  new  equipment  supplied  to  the  schools  under  the  NPBED  is \nbeing used for demonstration purposes only. Component 2 of the proposed Project will provide \nsupport to teachers to integrate new equipment into lessons plans so as to be used by students \nfor experiments. \n\nLack  of  Reading  Materials  and  Furniture  in  the  Library.  School  libraries  are  poorly \n8. \nequipped. Most libraries are providing mainly textbooks and reading material which is outdated \nand  not  in  demand  by  students  and  teachers.  School  librarians  reported  demand  for \nencyclopedias,  computer  manuals,  detective  stories,  novels,  poetry,  romance,  and  children \nbooks.  It  was  further  noted  that  the  library  rooms  visited  during  the  field  trips  do  not  have \nadequate tables, chairs, and bookshelves.  \n\nCommunity  Participation.  Field  visits  revealed \n\n9. \nimportance  of  community \nparticipation  is  maintaining  school  facilities.  Schools  where  parents,  teachers  and  other \ncommunity  members  are  actively  engaged  in  providing  support  are  better  maintained  than \nschools with low community participation. During vacation periods parents and teachers help to \nclean schools and assist in minor repair and repainting works; community members and parents \nprovide in-kind support and cash for maintenance work. \n\nthe \n\n10. \nLow  Budget  for  Building  Maintenance.  Insufficient  budget  allocations  for  preventive \nmaintenance have resulted in the considerable deterioration of school buildings over the last 15 \nyears. Form 2002 to 2004, of the total recurrent basic education budget, the average share in \nthe  expenditure  for  building  maintenance  was  below  0.5%.  In  2006,  the  recurrent  budget  for \nbuilding maintenance was increased to about 1.5% (SUM10 billion) of the recurrent budget, and \nthis  is  still  considered  insufficient.  Sustaining  the  physical  condition  of  rehabilitated  school \nfacilities  is  a  priority  concern  that  needs  to  be  addressed  in  the  future.  The  current  average \ncapital  investment  cost  for  the  construction  of  a  classroom  under  the  NPBED  (taking  into \naccount  the  average  costs  for  ancillary  spaces  such  as  corridors,  offices,  and  teachers\u2019  and \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nlibrary  rooms)  is  estimated  at  $7,000.  Based  on  international  experience,  the  annual \nmaintenance  budget  for  a  classroom  should  be  at  least  2%  of  its  capital  cost,  or  $140  per \nclassroom  per  year.  Considering  that  the  basic  education  system  has  a  total  of  217,465 \nclassrooms,  the  total  budget  for  school  building  maintenance  should  be  at  least  $30.4  million \n(SUM38  billion)  per  year.  The  Government  has  appreciated  the  importance  of  providing \nadequate funding to ensure appropriate maintenance of school facilities rehabilitated under the \nNPBED.  The  Government  has  committed  to  provide  sufficient  funding  for  maintenance  for  all \nschools supported under the Project, and this is included in the Project assurances. Further, the \nGovernment committed to increasing the allocation for operation and maintenance substantially \nafter the rehabilitation of schools under the NPBED is completed by shifting funding within the \nbudget for basic education from capital investments to recurrent budget.  \n \n11. \nEnhancing Community Participation. Community participation is an important feature \nof the Project. A significant criterion for schools to be included for upgrading under the Project \nwill be the extent to which communities are participating in school life and contribute to maintain \nand  improvement  of  school  facilities.  The  selection  of  schools  for  ADB  support  will  be  carried \nout on a competitive basis, fostering community participation and ensuring that equipment and \nmaterials  provided  to  schools  are  effectively  and  efficiently  utilized.  In  close  cooperation  with \nschool boards, principals of schools will be invited to prepare a school improvement plan, which \nwill provide information on  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\ncommunity participation in school life; \ninventory  indicating  quantity  and  current  condition  of  biology,  chemistry,  and \nphysics laboratories, teaching-aids, furniture, supplies and consumables;  \navailability  of  teachers,  and  laboratory  assistants  for  each  science  subject  and \ntheir qualifications;  \nplans ensuring that new equipment will be fully utilized by students and teachers \nfor laboratory experiments; \nthe method for monitoring that equipment is integrated into the teaching process; \nsufficient funding for operation and maintenance of the equipment and provision \nof consumables;  \nplanned after-school activities; \nplanned  fundraising  activities,  and  estimated  revenues  or  in-kind  assistance  to \nsupport  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  science  laboratory  rooms  and \nequipment; and \na  plan  to  encourage  students,  teachers,  and  community  members  to  maximize \nthe use of reading materials to be provided to the library.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nEDUCATION SECTOR FINANCING \n \n\nthe  education  system \n\nRestructuring  and  modernizing \n\nthe \n1. \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy. Public expenditure for education has increased every year \nsince  2000,  and  reached  8.1%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2006.  The  Government \nestimates  that  in  2007  the  share  of  the  education  expenditure  in  GDP  will  reach  9.4%, \nrepresenting  over  40%  of  total  public  expenditure.1  The  high  level  of  budget  allocation  for  the \neducation  sector  reflects  the  continuing  commitment  of  the  Government  to  strengthening  the \neducation system.  \n\ntop  priority \n\nis  a \n\nin \n\nThe  education  sector  is  financed  principally  from  three  sources:  (i)  central,  oblast \n2. \n(provincial), and raion (district) recurrent and investment budgets; (ii) foreign assistance; and (iii) \nthe  off-budget  School  Development  Fund  (SDF).  The  SDF  was  established  to  finance  school \nrehabilitation  and  construction  works  under  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education \nDevelopment  (NPBED)  2004\u20132009.  An  overview  on  education  expenditure  as  a  proportion  of \nGDP and total public expenditure is provided in Table A4.1. \n \n3. \nEducation  financing  in  Uzbekistan  has  been  decentralized.  In  the  past,  approximately \n65%  of  recurrent  expenditures  for  basic  education  were  provided  through  raion  budgets,  22% \nfrom oblast budgets and 13% from the central republican budget. In accordance with the law on \nthe  budget  system  and  tax  code,  local  budgets  are  formed  from  (i)  local  taxes  and  duties,  (ii) \nstate  taxes  and  duties,  (iii)  subsidies  and  budget  subventions  and  (iv)  interbudgetary  loans.2 \nHowever, clear targets for revenue collection and distribution of funds for education institutions \nhave not been set. The success of the decentralized financing system depends on the ability of \noblast  and  raion  administrations  to  collect  sufficient  local  revenues  to  cover  education \nexpenditures. In case of insufficient revenue generation at the local level, the system includes \nthe  risk  of  inadequate  allocation  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  and  regional \nimbalances. The risk of underfinancing is mitigated through transfers from the republican budget \nthat should cover shortfalls. At present, in Uzbekistan only five oblasts (Bukhara, Kashkadarya, \nNavoi,  Tashkent  oblast,  and  Tashkent  City)  out  of  14  oblasts  have  sufficient  tax  revenues  to \nfund  their  expenditure  without  support  from  the  republican  budget.3  However,  comparing  the \naverage  budget  allocation  per  student,  Ministry  of  Finance  data  confirms  that  the  regional \ndistribution of the educational budget is balanced, with an even per-student allocation nationally. \n\nTable A4.1: Education Expenditure as a Proportion of GDP and Total Public Expenditure \n(SUM billion) \n\n2001 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\n2002 \n\n2005 \n\n Item \nGDP  \nTotal Public Expenditure \nPublic Expenditure on Education  \n\n943  1,314  1,925  2,377 \n814 \n314 \n623 \n218 \n175 \n95 \n16 \n\nRecurrent \nCapital \nForeign-Financeda  \nSchool Development Off-budget Fund \n\n2007a \n2000 \n3,256  4,925  7,469  9,838  12,261  15,210  20,779  22,930 \n5,335 \n2,144 \n1,780 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n364 \n9.4 \n40.2 \n\n3,420 \n1,339 \n992 \n214  \u2014 \n\u2014 \n254 \n8.1 \nPEOE as a Share of GDP (%) \nPEOE as a Share of TPE (%) \n38.5 \nGDP = gross domestic product, PEOE = public expenditure on education, TPE = total public expenditure. \na Ministry of Finance estimates  \nb no information was provided for 2005\u20132007 \nSource: Ministry of Finance,. \n                                            \n1   The  average  proportion  for  education  expenditure  of  GDP  in  all  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \n\n2,793 \n1,009 \n765 \n181 \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n9.6 \n33.3 \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n8.8 \n33.0 \n\n4,389 \n1,689 \n1,435 \n\n676 \n501 \n142 \n33 \n\n134 \n8.8 \n39.1 \n\n\u2014 \n8.3 \n34.3 \n\n\u2014 \n9.1 \n35.1 \n\n434 \n336 \n95 \n\n8.2 \n36.1 \n\n62  \u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n \n\n(OECD) countries was about 5.6% in 2006. \n\n2   In 2003, the average composition of local budgets was (i) 63  % from state taxes and duties directed to local budgets, (ii) 20% \n\nfrom subventions and budget subsidies, and (iii) 17% from local taxes and duties. \n\n3   In  2003,  the  most  significant  republican  subsidies  were  allocated  to  Karakalpakstan  (over  57%  of  budgeted  expenditure), \n\nDjizzakh (55%), and Surkhandarya (48%).

Subsectoral  shares  of  public \neducation  expenditure  have  fluctuated  in  support  of  increased  allocations  for  basic  education. \nThe share of basic education expenditure in the total education expenditure increased from 37% \nin 2000 to 56% in 2006 and is estimated to reach 58% in 2007. Allocations to basic education \nwere  increased  significantly  from  2004  onwards  to  finance  the  comprehensive  school \nrehabilitation  program  and  substantial  salary  increases  for  teachers  under  the  NPBED.

Expenditures  for  basic  education  are \n5. \ndivided  into  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  Capital  expenditures  consist  of  three  major \ncategories:  (i)  construction,  (ii)  equipment  and  furniture,  and  (iii)  learning  materials.  Recurrent \nexpenditures  consist  of  six  major  categories:  (i)  salaries  and  social  contributions,  (ii)  office \nsupplies, (iii) food, (iv) building maintenance including minor building repairs, (v) utilities, and (vi) \nother recurrent expenditures. In 2006, about 90% of the total recurrent expenditure was utilized \nfor  personnel  costs,  which  include  salaries,  allowances,  and  social  security.  Over  the  past  4 \nyears \nteachers\u2019 \nremuneration,  including  salary  increases  and  the  establishment  of  a  new  performance-based \nincentive  system4  for  education  personnel.  The  new  incentive  scheme  includes  monthly \nadditional  top-ups  to  the  basic  salary  rates  to  reward  high-performing  teachers.  To  facilitate \nrewarding schemes for teachers, a director\u2019s fwas set up in each school in the amount of up to \n15%  of  total  annual  payroll.  According  to  MOPE  data,  during  2006  about  187,000  teachers \nreceived top-ups through the director\u2019s funds for a total amount of about SUM54 billion. \n \n6. \nFrom 2005, the allocation for capital expenditure increased substantially in line with the \nambitious NPBED program to finance school construction and rehabilitation works, and provide \nequipment  and  furniture  to  upgrade  schools  across  the  country.

It is estimated that the public expenditure for basic education will increase \nby about 19% in the period from 2006 to 2011. Based on Ministry of Finance estimates for 2007 \nas shown in table A4.1, the projection is based on (i) an increase in GDP of 7% per annum for \n2008\u20132011, (ii) an average inflation rate of 8%, and (iii) the assumption that the share of public \nexpenditures on education in GDP will remain at 9% from 2008 to 2011. To extrapolate further, \nit is assumed that in 2008 and 2009 the share of basic education expenditures in total education \nexpenditure  will  remain  at  56%  to  reflect  the  high  capital  investment  under  the  NPBED.  It  is \nplanned  that  the  major  school  rehabilitation  program  under  the  NPBED  will  be  completed  by \n2009  and  the  school  development  fund  SDF  will  cease  its  activity  subsequently.  To  date, \nprovisional  financial  projections  have  only  been  made  until  2009.  There  is  no  financial \ninformation for the years beyond 2009, although work is currently being carried out to estimate a \nbudgetary framework to ensure sufficient funding for operations and maintenance to sustain the \ninvestments  made  in  school  facilities  under  the  NPBED.  It  is  assumed  that  due  to  the  drop  in \ncapital investments after 2009, the portion of the basic education budget in the public education \nexpenditure  will  decrease  to  42%,  to  the  same  average  share  as  between  2002  and  2004. \nThese projections are shown in table A4.4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.4: Projections of GDP, Education Expenditure, and Government Share \n\n2005 \n\n  \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n Item  \n\nGDP (SUM billion)  \n\n15,210.0 \n\n20,779.0 \n\n22,930.0  26,500.0 \n\n30,600.0 \n\n35,400.0 \n\n40,900.0 \n\nAverage Exchange Rate ($) \n\n1,115.0 \n\n1,220.0 \n\n1,300.0 \n\n1,400.0 \n\n1,500.0 \n\n1,600.0 \n\n1,700.0 \n\nGDP ($ billion)  \n\nTotal Public Expenditure ($ billion)  \n\nPublic Expenditure on Education ($ billion)  \nPublic Expenditure on Basic Education ($ \nmillion)  \n\n13.6 \n\n3.1 \n\n1.2 \n\n16.0 \n\n3.6 \n\n1.38 \n\n17.6 \n\n4.1 \n\n1.65 \n\n18.9 \n\n4.6 \n\n1.7 \n\n20.4 \n\n22.1 \n\n24.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n1.8 \n\n5.9 \n\n2.0 \n\n6.6 \n\n2.2 \n\n631.0 \n\n775.0 \n\n952.0 \n\n952.0 \n\n1,008.0 \n\n840.0 \n\n924.0 \n\nADB Contribution to the Project ($ million)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10.0 \n\n12.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n3.0 \n\nGovernment Share in the Project ($ million) \nGovernment Share in the Public Expenditure \non Education (%) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSources: 2007 figures are Ministry of Finance estimates; 2008\u20132011 figures are Asian Development Bank projections \nbased on Ministry of Finance data.  \n\n0.005 \n\n0.0045 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.47 \n\n8.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8. \nSustainability of the Project. The Government\u2019s contribution to the Project is estimated \nat  $13  million  (30%  of  the  total  project  costs)  over  4  years  and  mainly  includes civil  works  for \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  schools,  and  expenditures  for  O&M  for  schools  in  the  three \nproject provinces. Under the NPBED, sufficient funds have been allocated through the SDF to \ncomplete  the  civil  works  of  at  least  700  schools  in  the  project  provinces  that  will  be  further \nupgraded  through  ADB  financing.  The  Government  also  confirmed  that  sufficient funds  will  be \nallocated to cover expenditure for building maintenance of schools included in the Project, which \nis  also  reflected  in  the  Project  assurances.  Assuming  that  the  Project  starts  in  2008,  project \ncosts for the Government during the project duration will be les than 0.5% of public expenditure \non  education.  Such  project  costs  are  insignificant  and  strongly  suggest  that  project  activities \nsupported by the Government are sustainable. However, there is need for caution in respect of \nthe  proportion  of  government  allocation  for  maintenance,  which  needs  to  be  increased  at  the \nschool level to finance preventive maintenance expenditures. ADB is planning to further expand \nits  analysis  of  education  financing  in  Uzbekistan  to  provide  concrete  and  feasible  solutions  to \nincrease efficiency of the sector. \n \n9. \nIn  order  to  determine  whether  there  will  be  sufficient  funding  available  for  adequate \nmaintenance of newly constructed and rehabilitated schools within the entire education system \nafter the NPBED is successfully completed in 2009, an examination was made of the estimated \nrecurrent  budget  for  basic  education  based  on  recurrent  budget  in  2006  and  the  projected \nbudget  for  2007  as  shown  in  Table  A4.3.  The  following  discussion  is  arbitrary  and  is  used  to \nillustrate a potential scenario for the duration of the project. \n \nSalaries. In 2006, about 90% of the recurrent budget was committed for salaries for staff \n10. \nexpenditure,  and  the  Government  budgeted  91.4%  of  recurrent  budget  into  this  category  in \n2007.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the  working  conditions  for  teachers,  and \nteachers\u2019  salaries  have  been  increased  substantially  during  the  past  3  years.  As  indicated  in \nTable A4.5, for the projection purpose, it is assumed that the new salary level will be maintained \nand salaries will increase annually by 8% from 2008 onwards to allow for inflation increases. \n \n11. \nOffice Supplies and Food Supplies. It is assumed that budget provisions for these two \ncategories will increase by 5% annually for the period 2008\u20132011. The same is applied for the \ncost category \u201cother expenditures.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n41 \n\n12. \nUtilities.  In  2006,  the  Government  allocated  SUM29  billion  or  about  4%  of  recurrent \nbudget  to  utilities;  for  2007,  SUM33.2  billion  is  budgeted.  The  utilities  include  electricity  costs, \ngas,  coal,  water  supplies,  and  sewage  and  waste  removal  costs.  The  Ministry  of  Finance \nestimates that, after the school rehabilitation program is completed in 2009, utility costs for the \nentire upgraded school system will increase by 14%. For 2008, an increase of 10% is estimated. \nFor  2009,  a  further  increase  of  14%  is  projected,  and  thereafter,  an  annual  increase  of  8%  is \nprojected to allow for inflation. \n \n13. \nTelecommunications. Telecommunications expenditures in 2006 were SUM0.7 billion. \nUnder  the  NPBED  the  Government  provides  computer  classrooms  to  schools  and  plans  to \nconnect all schools to the Internet. Assessments estimates that telecommunication expenditures \nwill increase in 2008 by almost three times, and thereafter as shown in table A4.5. \n \nBuilding  Maintenance.  Starting  in  2005,  the  Government  has  substantially  increased \n14. \nthe  budget  for  recurrent  expenditure  for  building  maintenance  and  minor  repair,  and  this \nreached  SUM10.5  billion  in  2006  (Table  A4.3).  The  major  share  of  the  budget  for  building \nmaintenance  and  minor  repair  is  allocated  through  the  SDF,  which  is  expected  to  cease \noperation  after  2009.  Although  no  budget  information  for  the  years  beyond  2009  have  been \nagreed  upon,  the  Government  is  committed  to  providing  sufficient  funding  for  maintenance \nensuring  that  newly  upgraded  schools  are  preserved.  Thus,  the  Government  committed  to \nproviding sufficient funding through the state recurrent budget. \n \n15. \nBased on international experience and examinations of school infrastructure, the annual \nbudget for school building maintenance should be at least $30.4 million (about SUM38 billion) \nafter all rehabilitation work has been completed in 2009.5 Table A4.5 provides gradual projection \nof the required funding estimated for building maintenance.  \n \n16. \nOutlook.  In  order  to  assess  whether  sufficient  budget  for  the  projected  increased \nrecurrent  expenditures  is  available,  the  following  projection  was  made.  From  2002\u20132004,  the \naverage  share  of  recurrent  expenditures  in  basic  education  was  above  90%.  With  the  start  of \nthe  rehabilitation  and  construction  works  under  the  NPBED  in  2005,  capital  expenditures \nincreased  substantially.  Proportions  in  2007  shifted  to  30%  capital  expenditure  and  70% \nrecurrent  expenditure.  It  is  assumed  that  the  share  of  the  recurrent  expenditure  of  the  total \nexpenditure  on  basic  education  budget  will  be  70%  for  2008  and  2009,  to  reflect  the  planned \ncivil works and upgrading activities. After the completion of the NPBED in 2009, it is projected \nthat the share of recurrent expenditure will follow the earlier trend and again reach 90%, which \nwill  provide  for  increased  funds  for  maintenance  of  school  facilities.  Projections  are  shown  in \nTable A4.5. \n \n17. \nThe  illustrated  scenario  indicates  that  sufficient  recurrent  budget  will  be  available  to \nensure adequate maintenance of newly upgraded school facilities. The projections do not take \ninto  consideration  community  contributions  in  terms  of  participation  in  maintenance  activities \nand  fundraising,  which  will  reduce  dependency  on  public  allocations.  However  caution  is \nrequired  with  respect  to  financing  the  rehabilitation  of  the  entire  school  network  which  was \nestimated  by  Ministry  of  Finance  at  $1.2  billion  of  which  75%  will  be  financed  by  the \nGovernment.  Supplementary  to  the  contribution  of  ADB  additional  funding  will  be  required  to \naddress  all  capital  investment  needs.  The  Government  will  depend  on  external  assistance  to \nmeet future challenges in upgrading all schools in the country.  \n                                            \n5   The current average capital investment cost for the construction of a classroom under NPBED (taking into account \naverage cost-shares for ancillary spaces such as corridors, offices, and teachers\u2019 and library rooms) is estimated at \n$7,000. Based on international experience, the annual maintenance budget for a classroom should be at least 2% \nof  its  capital  cost,  or  $140  per  classroom  per  year.    Considering  that  the  basic  education  system  has  a  total  of \n217,465  classrooms,  the  total  budget  for  school  building  maintenance  should  be  at  least  $30.4  million  (SUM38 \nbillion) per year. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.5: Projected Recurrent Budget for Basic Education \n(SUM billion) \n\nTotal\n\n2010 \n\nSubtotal \n\n2006 \n945.0\n\n2008 \n1,332.0\n\n2007 \n1,238.0\n\n2009 \n1,512.0\n\nBuilding maintenance  \n\n4.7 \n22.9 \n44.9 \n2.7 \n0.8 \n\n2011 \n1,334.0  1,570.0\n\n Item \nTotal expenditure on basic education \nTotal recurrent basic education   \nexpenditures  \n \nSalaries and social charges \nOffice supplies  \nFood supplies \nUtilities \nTelecommunications \nOther expenditures \n\n685.7\n621.7\n2.7\n19.1\n29.0\n0.7\n2.0\n675.2\n10.5\n685.7\n\n932.4\n862.5\n4.3\n20.8\n36.5\n2.1\n0.7\n926.9\n25.0\n951.9\n\n866.6\n798.6\n4.1\n19.8\n33.2\n0.9\n0.7\n857.3\n9.3\n866.6\n\n1,058.4\n931.5\n4.5\n21.8\n41.6\n2.4\n0.8\n1,002.6\n30.0\n1,031.8\n\n1,200.0  1,413.0\n1,006.0  1,086.5\n4.9\n24.0\n48.5\n3.0\n0.9\n1,082.0  1,167.8\n38.0\n1,119.2  1,205.8\n    Sources: 2007 figures are Ministry of Finance estimates; 2008\u20132011 figures are Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n18. \nBenefits.  Government  provision  of  basic  education  services  is  justified  because  of \nimperfect  market  conditions  and  lack  of  adequate  private  education  provision  and  financing.6 \nFurther, the rationale to support public funding to promote rural basic education in Uzbekistan \nrests  on  equity  justification.  Disparities  between  urban  and  rural  schools  are  apparent.  The \nProject  will  contribute  to  improved  learning  opportunities  for  children  in  disadvantaged  rural \nareas.  \n \n19. \nThe major beneficiaries of the Project will be about 670,000 students enrolled in at least \n700  schools  to  be  upgraded  in  the  three  project  provinces.  In  addition  about  45,000  teachers \nfrom  schools  supported  by  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  from  improved  teacher  training \nmeasures. Further, communities in the three project provinces will benefit from schools that will \noffer  after-school  activities  such  as  social  events,  learning  and  information  programs,  sport \nactivities, and hobby clubs. School board members will benefit from training courses, and school \nmanagements will benefit from fundraising and school improvement schemes.  \n \n\n38.0 \n\n                                            \n6 Credit markets do not provide loans to low-income families to finance their children\u2019s education.   \n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n43 \n\nCOMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN BASIC EDUCATION \n\n \n1. \nCommunity participation in education is a promising concept for further strengthening of \neducation  quality  in  Uzbekistan.  During  the  Soviet  period,  parents  largely  left  education  to \nGovernment,  as  funding  of  school  facilities  was  sufficient  and  education  services  in  schools \nwere considered satisfactory; hence there was little need for additional parental and community \ninvolvement  in  school  affairs.  After  the  collapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  the  quality  of \neducation  provision  deteriorated,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  Since  2004,  the  Government  has \nstarted  a  comprehensive  reform  program  and  commenced  a  broad  rehabilitation  scheme  to \nupgrade  deteriorated  school  facilities.  However,  most  schools  in  rural  areas  are  still  lacking \nsufficient  recurrent  funding  to  cover  basic  operational  and  maintenance  costs.  Parents  and \ncommunities  recognized  this  issue  and  realized  the  need  to  provide  additional  support  to \nschools  to  meet  urgent  school  needs.  In  addition,  schools  started  to  face  new  issues  of \nstudents\u2019  absenteeism  and  dropping  out  resulting  from  a  decrease  in  education  quality  and \npervasive  poverty.  The  affordability  of  education  presents  challenges  for  many  low-income \nfamilies, in particular in rural areas. With the commencement of each school year, families need \nto meet new costs including school uniforms, textbook rentals and payments for tutorials. The \nvast majority of villages lack venues that provide for learning and recreation activities for adults \nand  children.  Thus,  more  and  more  communities  are  exploring  possibilities  to  utilize  school \nfacilities  as  community  focal  points  for  organizing  social  events,  sports  activities,  and  training \nand information programs for young and adult community members. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  encourages  community  participation  to  improve  the  quality  of \neducation  and  strengthen  governance  and  accountability  in  schools.  The  legal  framework  for \ncommunity participation is provided in the National Program on Personal Training (NPPT), the \nLaw  on  Education,  and  the  Regulation  on  General  Education,  all  of  which  promote  the \nestablishment  of  school  boards  and  parental  committees  to  increase  public  governance  and \nensure  greater  transparency  in  decision  making  processes.  In  support of  the  legal framework, \nthe Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) developed the partnership concept of Family-Mahalla-\nSchool,  which  broadly  defines  roles  and  responsibilities  of  parents  and  other  mahalla \n(community) stakeholders to support the education process at the school level.  \n \nimprove  public \n3. \ngovernance  in  education,  and  promotes  creation  of  public  governance  bodies  in  educational \nentities.  The  NPPT  promotes  a  life-long  learning  approach  for  all  community  members,  and \nsupports  the  participation  of  parents,  public  associations,  and  mahallas,  in  education  delivery. \nThe  Regulation  On  General  Education  in  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  was  adopted  by  the \nCabinet  of  Ministers  and  underlines  the  need  for  close cooperation  between  schools,  parents, \nmahalla  committees,  public  foundations,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The \nregulation  provides \ninclude \nrepresentatives  of  enterprises,  public  associations,  mahalla  committees,  and  parents.  By  a \nspecial decree issued by the Cabinet of Ministers, the financial autonomy of schools has been \nincreased substantially. Under the decree schools are allowed to generate and keep revenues \nfrom parental and community contribution and income-generating activities (off-budget income). \nFurther,  schools  were  given  a  legal  status  to  open  a  bank  account.  In  order  to  establish \ntransparent  mechanisms  to  operate  off-budget  funds  at  schools,  MOPE  developed  guidelines \nfor school boards to monitor financial transactions. \n \nIn October 2005, MOPE approved a draft Regulation on Establishing Trustee Boards in \n4. \nEducational  Institutions.  According  to  the  regulation,  school  boards  may  include  up  to  10 \nmembers including parents, teachers, mahalla leaders, and sponsors. However, the regulation \n\nThe  Law  on  Education  encourages  community  participation \n\nto  establish  school  boards,  which  may \n\nlegal  basis \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\ndoes not specify the representation ratio of each community group. Teachers are nominated by \nparents for board membership. A chairperson of the board and its members will be elected by \ngeneral  meeting  of  parents  for  a  1-year  period.  The  regulation  stipulates  that  the  utilization  of \noff-budget  resources  needs  the  approval  of  the  school  boards.  According  to  the  regulation, \nschool  boards  have  an  advisory  role  aiming  at  providing  guidance  to  (i)  improve  the  learning \nenvironment  for  students,  (ii)  improve  the  working  conditions  for  teaching  staff,  (iii)  assist  in \nlaunching  extra-curriculum  activities,  (iv)  improve  the  school  facilities;  (v)  attract  additional \nresources  to  support  schools,  (vi) mobilize  support  for  students  from  low-income  families,  and \n(vii) organize recreation and learning activities at school premises for all community members.  \n \n5. \nPartnership Concept of Family-Mahalla-School. In support of the legal framework, the \nGovernment  introduced  the  Family-Mahalla-School  concept  to  strengthen  partnership  among \nfamilies, communities and schools. The concept broadly defines the roles and responsibilities of \nthe  three  major  stakeholders  in  education:  school,  family,  and  mahalla.  Mahallas  are \nresponsible for (i) identifying and addressing education-related problems in the community, (ii) \nidentifying and supporting vulnerable families economically and morally, (iii) attracting sponsor \nand  donor  local  funds,  and  (iv)  assisting  schools  to  implement  out-of-school  educational \nactivities. Families bear the responsibility for (i) creating appropriate home conditions to support \nthe learning process of children, (ii) ensuring a healthy environment in the family, (iii) ensuring \nproper  moral  guidance  for  children,  and  (iv)  being  in  touch  with  teachers  and  school \nmanagement to monitor  learning outcomes. Primary duties of the school, apart from providing \neducation services to students, is to (i) guide parents and young families on education-related \nmatters;  (ii)  provide  pedagogical  assistance  to  families  with  difficult  children;  (iii)  coordinate \nactivities  of  educational  stakeholders  in  the  community,  and  (iv)  jointly  with  mahalla \nrepresentatives,  organize  social  activities,  sport  events,  hobby  clubs,  learning  programs,  and \nother measures for children and families.   \n \n6. \nin  school \nmanagement  has  not  yet  been  fully  advanced  in  all  schools  in  Uzbekistan,  and  the  level  of \nparental and community participation needs to be enhanced throughout the country, there are \nmany  successful  examples  of  community  participation,  which  include  (i)  improved  school \ninfrastructure  through  regular  repair  and  maintenance  works  carried  out  by  community \nmembers, and financial and in-kind contributions from parents; (ii) improved attendance rates in \nschools  through  active  parent  involvement  in  school  affairs,  which  was  initiated  by  awareness \ncampaigns  creating  a  better  understanding  of  the  benefits  of  education  for  the  future  of  their \nchildren;  (iii)  increased  support  for  students  from  low-income  families  in  terms  of  learning \nmaterial, food, clothes, cash provided by mahallas, and special support schemes; (iv) improved \nlearning  environment  through  additional  learning  and  reading  materials  and  sports  equipment \npurchased  with  community  donations;  (v)  after-school  activities  such  as  social  events,  hobby \nclubs,  and  learning  programs  during  nonschool  periods  (afternoons,  weekends,  and  holidays) \nfor  children  and  adult  community  members;  (vi)  improved  governance  in  schools  through \nparticipation  of  parents  in  managing  off-budget  funds,  selecting  teachers  for  awards  based  on \ngood performance, identifying income generating activities, and preparing school improvement \nplans.          \n \n7.  \nIssues. Although, the existing legal framework encourages community participation and \npromotes social partnership, and about 65% of all basic schools have established school boards \nand  parental  committees,  the  level  of  active  participation  of  community  and  parents  in  school \ngovernance  is  often  weak  and  depends  on  the  encouragement  and  willingness  of  the  school \nprincipals.  Lack  of  awareness  and  knowledge  among  directors,  teachers,  parents,  and \ngovernmental officials about opportunities for, and benefits of, community participation in school \n\nSuccess  Stories.  Although \n\nthe  practice  of  community \n\ninvolvement \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n45 \n\nmanagement was reported as another principal issue to establish active and successful school \nboards  and  parental  committees.  Field  visits  revealed  that  existing  school  boards  have  weak \ncapacity and skills to develop school improvement plans, identify income generating activities, \nand  conduct  fundraising,  and  as  a  result  fail  to  effectively  fulfill  the  tasks  and  responsibilities \nassigned to school boards. The lack of (i) monitoring mechanisms to review education quality, \nteacher  performance,  and  learning  achievements  and  (ii)  transparent  mechanisms  to  monitor \nand  operate  off-budget  funds,  are  issues  raised  by  community  members  and  nongovernment \norganizations during the field visits. In addition, the responsibilities and operational procedures \nof school boards should be clearly specified in the School Charter1 of each school. \n\n \n \n\n                                            \n1  A regulatory document that defines school operation and is developed by each school and registered by the state \n\nauthorized body. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROJECT OBLASTS (PROVINCES) AND RATIONALE \n\n \n1. \nTo  focus  the  investments  under  the  Project,  the  Government  has  selected  three  Project \noblast  (provinces):  Tashkent  oblast,  Surkhandarya,  and  Kashkadarya.  Kashkadarya  includes  13 \nraions  (districts),  Tashkent  oblast  has  15  raions  and  6  towns,  and  Surkandarya  consists  of  14 \nraions. About 81% of Surkhandarya\u2019s population live in rural areas; the figure for Kashkadarya is \n75% and for Tashkent oblast about 61% (Table A6.1). Therefore, most of the population in these \nregions  is  engaged  in  agricultural  activities.  The  selection  of  the  three  provinces  has  been \nproposed by the  Government based on poverty indicators as well as on the quality of education. \nWhile  Kashkadarya  and  Surkhandarya  are  among  the  poorest  regions  of  the  country,  Tashkent \noblast has a better situation in terms of the percentage of the population living in poverty. However, \nthe human development index (HDI)1 is lower in Tashkent oblast compared with other regions, and \nthe quality of education is suffering, as noted in the tables below. The Project will therefore benefit \ncommunities  suffering  from  both  poverty  and  poor  education  outputs,  hence  enhancing \nopportunities and quality of education.   \n \n2. \nSocioeconomic  Situation.  Per  capita  gross  regional  product  (GRP)  in  2005  for  all  three \noblasts  was  lower  than  the  average  for  the  nation.  Per  capita  GRP  indicators  are  84.8%  of  the \nnational average for Kashkadarya and 61.3% for Surkandarya. Surkandarya per capita GRP with \nSUM372,000 ($340 equivalent) is half the country\u2019s of SUM606,300 for 2005. Real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita reflected in purchasing power parity dollars still shows that Kashkadarya \n($2,140)  and  Surkandarya  ($1,792)  produce  less  regional  output  than  the  country  average. \nTashkent oblast has a per capita GRP of 99% as compared with the national average; however the \nHDI  in  the  region  is  deteriorating,  a  sign  of  growing  variations  and  disparities  among  the \npopulation.

Significant  variations  in  per  capita  education  recurrent  expenditures  in  basic  education \nwere noted in Tashkent oblast as compared with other project oblasts. The variations in Tashkent \noblast  are  an  additional  indicator  of  growing  disparities  between  rural  and  urban  areas  in  the \nregion, and of deteriorating education quality in rural and remote areas.     \n \n\nTable A6.4: Regional Disparities in Recurrent Costs per Student  \n(SUM\u2018000) \n\nRegion \n\n \n1  Karakalpakstan \n2  Andijan \n3  Bukhara \n4 \nJizzah \n5  Kashkadarya \n6  Novoi \n7  Namangan \n8  Samarkand \n9  Surkandarya \n10  Syrdarya \n11  Tashkent \n12  Ferghana \n13  Khorezm \n14  Tashkent city \n\n2004 \n74.1 \n59.6 \n63.9 \n70.5 \n62.8 \n89.6 \n54.9 \n60.6 \n66.5 \n79.8 \n66.2 \n58.5 \n62.8 \n62.4 \n66.6 \n  9.3 \n0.139 \n( ) = negative, coef = coefficient to the mean. \na 2006 figures are Ministry of Finance estimates. \nSource: Calculations based on Ministry of Finance data.  \n\nCoef.(%) \n11 \n(10) \n(4) \n6 \n(6) \n35 \n(18) \n(9) \n0 \n20 \n(1) \n(12) \n(6) \n(6) \n \n \n \n\nStandard deviation \ncoefficient (st.dev/mean) \n\n  Mean \n \n \n\n2005 \n99.0 \n90.6 \n92.1 \n87.2 \n91.2 \n 111.3 \n91.5 \n92.4 \n94.0 \n 102.4 \n89.6 \n92.7 \n90.6 \n96.1 \n94,3 \n6.3 \n0.066 \n\nCoef.(%) \n 5 \n (4) \n (2) \n (8) \n (3) \n18 \n (3) \n (2) \n 0 \n 9 \n (5) \n (2) \n (4) \n 2 \n \n \n \n\n2006 a \n140.2 \n120.1 \n118.7 \n125.9 \n130.2 \n144.9 \n126.8 \n125.7 \n135.7 \n129.1 \n129.0 \n118.9 \n129.6 \n132.1 \n129.1 \n   7.6 \n0.059 \n\nCoef.(%) \n 9 \n (7) \n (8) \n (2) \n 1 \n12 \n (2) \n (3) \n 5 \n 0 \n 0 \n (8) \n 0 \n 2 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n49 \n\nSCHOOL SELECTION CRITERIA AND SELECTION PROCESS \n\n1. \nTo  ensure  ownership  of  the  project,  the  selection  of  schools  will  be  carried  out  by  the \nGovernment  at  the  beginning  of  implementation  of  the  Project.  Within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness the Government will submit to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) the first batch \nof schools to benefit from the Project. By March each year a new batch will be submitted to ADB \n(the annual submission will allow schools still under rehabilitation or construction, and those due \nto  be  rehabilitated  or  constructed  in  the  future,  to  benefit  from  the  Project).  Only  newly \nconstructed  schools  and  schools  which  have  been  comprehensively  rehabilitated  under  the \nNational  Program  for  Basic  Education  Development  (NPBED)  will  be  considered  for  ADB \nfinancing under component 1.  \n\nA. \n\nFirst Step Selection: Rehabilitated or Newly Constructed Schools \n\n2. \nBased on the school mapping survey, and on rehabilitation plans to be financed under \nthe NPBED, the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) will prepare a preliminary list of schools \nwhich have been fully rehabilitated and newly constructed in the three project provinces and are \nhence eligible to be part of first batch of schools to be included in the Project. MOPE will ensure \nthat  science  laboratory  and  library  rooms  at  schools  are  suitable  to  accommodate  equipment \nand  materials  to  be  provided  under  the  Project.  The  preselection  of  schools  will  meet  the \nfollowing criteria. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOnly newly constructed schools and schools which have been comprehensively \nrehabilitated under the NPBED are eligible to be included in the list of candidate \nschools. \nThe candidate schools must have  science laboratory and library rooms suitable \nto accommodate equipment and materials to be provided under the Project. \nThe  candidate  schools  must  be  located  out  of  the  oblast  (province)  city  and/or \ntowns. \nThe  candidate  schools  must  have  not  received  any  laboratory  equipment,  or \nhave  received  only  partial  equipment  for  the  last  5  years,  from  an  international \ndonor under the government-approved project. \n\n3. \nMOPE  will  develop  a  list  of  preselected  candidate  schools.  Each  candidate  school \nthrough  oblast  and  raion  departments  of  education  at  MOPE  will  be  officially  informed  and \ninvited to submit their school improvement plans.   \n\nB. \n\nSecond Step Selection: School Improvement Plans \u2013 Competitive Selection \n\n4. \nWithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOPE  will  establish  a  selection  committee  in \neach project province that will be in charge of actively communicating with schools included in \nthe preselection as for step 1, and review improvement plans received from schools. \n\n5. \nEach  school  willing  to  participate  in  the  Project  will  submit  improvement  plans  for \nevaluation. The schools passing the review of the selection committee will be those meeting the \nfollowing criteria. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPlans  and  evidence  showing  a  commitment  to  efficiently  utilize  equipment  and \nmaterials received under the Project. \nEvidence of active community participation. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n(iii) \n\nPlans  for  generation  of  funds  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs \nassociated with new equipment. \n\n6. \nSchools  will  be  evaluated  based  on  the  submission  of  school  improvement  plans.  The \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  provide  each  selection  committee  with  a  draft  form  to \nguide  preparation  of  school  improvement  plans.  The  plan  to  be  developed  by  school \nmanagement together with school board and parents will provide the following information: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ninventory  indicating  quantity  and  current  condition  of  biology,  chemistry,  and \nphysics laboratories, teaching-aids, furniture, supplies and consumables;  \navailability  of  teachers  and  laboratory  assistants  for  each  science  subject  and \ntheir qualifications;  \nplans for integration of laboratory practice in the curriculum;  \nplanned learning and recreation after-school activities for community members; \ncommunity participation in school life; \nplanned  fundraising  activities,  and  estimated  revenues  or  in-kind  assistance  to \nsupport the O&M of science laboratory rooms and equipment; \nplan to encourage students, teachers, and community members to maximize the \nuse of reading materials to be provided to the library; and \n\n(viii)  plans  on  (a)  proper  waste  treatment,  (b)  training  programs  for  students  and \nscience  teachers  on  proper  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous  and  toxic \nmaterials and other safety measures in the laboratory, and (c) regular emergency \ndrills to prepare a response to fire and chemical spills. \n\nSpecial attention will be given to community participation in school life and preparation of \n\n7. \nimprovement plans. The committees will hence evaluate that \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe school board is established and actively functioning at school;   \nparents and community members constitute majority representation in the school \nboard; \nparents  and  community  members  participate  in  the  development  of  school \nimprovement plans; and \nthe school board has initiated and implemented a number of school improvement \ninitiatives with the support of parents and community, such as (a) fundraising; (b) \nmaintenance  and  improvement  of  education  facilities;  (c)  organizing  social \nevents,  recreation  activities,  and  educational  programs  for  adult  and  youth \ncommunity  members;  (d)  arrangement  of  extracurricular  activities  for  school \nchildren; and (e) support measures for low-income families. \n\n8. \nThe  selection  committee  from  each  Project  region  will  review  the  plans.  A  priority  list \nbased on final recommendations of the selection committees will be submitted to MOPE for final \ndecision,  together  with  all  School  Improvement  Plans  received  by  the  committee,  The  final \nselection  of  schools,  equipment,  and  furniture  packages  for  each  school  will  be  submitted  by \nMOPE to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for further concurrence. \n\nC. \n\nTerms of Reference of Selection Committees \n\n9. \nMOPE will establish three selection committee (one for each region) within 3 months of \nloan  effectiveness.  The  committees  will  consist  of  five  members,  including  one  representative \nfrom  the  oblast  administration,  two  representatives  from  raion  administrations,  and  two \nrepresentatives  from  civil  society  organizations  operating  in  the  region.  During  the  project \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n51 \n\nimplementation  period,  the  committees  will  meet  at  the  beginning  of  each  calendar  year  to \nprioritize schools for upgrading for each year.

In  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  National  Program  for  Basic  Education  Development \n(NPBED), the Project aims to improve learning development prospects and income earning opportunities of graduates from \nrural  schools.  This  aim  can  be  achieved  through  more  equitable  access  to,  and  improved  quality  and  relevance  of,  basic \neducation in rural areas in three project oblasts (provinces). The Project will contribute to the following social development \noutcomes: (i) enabling students and educators to participate more effectively in the knowledge-based economy by virtue of \nenhanced  problem-solving  skills,  improved  capacity  to  study  independently,  ability  to  work  with  information,  and  ability  to \napply key skills in real job settings; (ii) upgrading facilities of selected rural schools through the provision of laboratory and \nteaching equipment, class room furniture and reading material; (iii) creating flexible mechanisms for teacher development \nengaged  in  rural  schools  to  improve  the  quality  and  frequency  of  in-service  training  fostering  student-centered  teaching \nmethods;  and  (iv)  assisting  the  Government  in  promoting  community  participation  in  school  management  to  improve \nlearning environments for students and open schools for social activities and learning programs for all community members. \nThrough improving learning environments in rural areas, where poverty is prevalent, the proposed Project will contribute to \nimprove  attendance  rates  of  poor  students.  In  opening  schools  to  the  communities  for  social  activities  and  adult  learning \nand information programs, the proposed Project will contribute to improved living conditions for all community members and \ndecrease the disparity in education quality between urban and rural areas. The overall impact of the project will be improved \nlearning development prospects and further education opportunities of graduates from rural schools. \n \nThe  Project  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  thrust  of  creating  equal  opportunities  for  all  students.  About \n670,000 students and 63,000 teachers will benefit from upgraded school facilities in the three project regions. Specific pro-\npoor measures of the Project include: (i) ensuring that all selected project schools are from rural areas; (ii) improve access \nto  rehabilitated  schools,  new  science  laboratories,  and  upgraded  libraries  for  rural  students  and  teachers;  (iii)  enhance \nprofessional competence of rural teachers by fostering curriculum-relevant, student-centered lessons and learning activities \nfor  specific  subject  groups;  (iv)  increasing  community  participation  to  support  schools  and  poor  students;  (v)  encourage \nschools to provide school facilities to local communities for adult learning activities, extra-curriculum measures, and social \nevents. Assuming that about 70% of students in rural areas enrolled in basic education belong to low-income families, the \nProject  will contribute to enhancing income opportunities for the poor. In addition, at the end of the project, it is assumed \nthat at least 3,500 school board members and parents will have benefited from trainings under component 3. About 45,000 \nteachers for grades 5\u20139 will benefit from new teacher training programs. Approximately 1,600 school managers will benefit \nfrom  training  under  the  Project.  Further,  about  450  methodologists,  administrators,  and  teacher  trainers  will  benefit  from \ntraining programs under component 2 and component 3.  \n \nThe  Government  considers  reform  of  the  current  education  system  is  an  integral  part  of  its  social  strategy,  aimed  at \nimproving access of the poor to income generating opportunities, and its approach to support steady economic growth and \ncreate equal opportunities for all by removing disparities between rural and urban regions and improve living conditions in \nrural areas. \n \nIn 2004, the Government launched the NPBED 2004\u20132009, which aims to strengthen basic education to meet international \nstandards and remove disparities between rural and urban schools. Under the NPBED basic schools are being rehabilitated \nand  upgraded.  By  2009,  at  least  8,476  schools  should  be  covered  under  the  NPBED,  which  includes  almost  87%  of  all \nbasic  schools  in  the  country.  The  NPBED  also  provides  funds  for  establishing  incentive  schemes  to  motivate  and  award \nhigh  performing  teachers  and  directors,  improve  in-service  teacher  training,  and  strengthen  curriculum  development  and \nlearning assessments. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n66 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  World  Bank  Living  Standard  Assessment  (2007)  shows  that  an  estimated  27.2%1  of  the  population,  or  6.8  million \npeople, live at or below the poverty line. Of these, approximately one third, or 2.3 million people, are classified as extremely \npoor. Poverty is significantly higher in rural than in urban areas (29.8% versus 22.6%) and 69% of the poor and 72% of the \nextreme poor are found in rural Uzbekistan. Poverty is also associated with specific regions; it is thus relatively very high in \nKashkadarya and in Surkandarya. This is partly the result of environmental factors but is also because of a bias in public \npolicy that has allocated far more public investment, credit, subsidies, and other scarce resources to the urban areas while \nbroadly neglecting rural areas.2 \n \nAccording to the 2005 Government\u2019s Interim Welfare Improvement Strategy Paper (I-WISP), within each region, there are \nalso territories which are relatively better or worse off in terms of living standards. There are significant differences in social \nand  economic  conditions  (availability  of  jobs,  access  to  education  and  health  care,  and  other  social  services)  and  living \nstandards between urban and rural areas.  \n \nA high proportion of the poor in Uzbekistan tend to be rich in human capital. Thus most have at least 9 years of education. \nThe  surveys3  indicate  that  poor  households  are  distinguished  by  the  following  features:  (i)  high  unemployment  or \nunderemployment, (ii) minimum educational qualifications, (iii) more than three children per family, (iv) reduced access to \nland of good quality, and (v) less integrated into the market economy. There is also a direct link between education level, \nemployment, and poverty. The families whose heads do not have secondary education are at the highest poverty risk.4 \n \nPoverty and social assessments were carried out to inform project design. They revealed the following: (i) inequality exists \nin education quality and access in the regions between urban and rural schools; (ii) the existence of barriers to fully utilizing \nin-service  training  opportunities  for  teachers  from  rural  areas;  (iii)  the  need  for  community  involvement  to  address  social \nissues in schools; and (iv) the need for local communities to utilize school facilities for additional learning opportunities and \nsocial events. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe main stakeholder groups are students, teachers, education managers (both administrators within the education system \nand  policymakers),  teacher  educators,  and  designers  of  learning  materials,  teacher  educators  (both  preservice  and  in-\nservice), school boards, parents\u2019 associations, and communities. The Project was designed through a participatory process \ninvolving key government stakeholders at the national, oblast, and raion levels. During the project design and preparation \nphase, stakeholders participated in number of meetings individually and in groups and provided their feedback for use in the \ndesign of various components. Focus-group discussions and individual interviews with stakeholders in three project oblasts \nof the country were held during the preparation phase. The project design also involved consultations with nongovernment \norganizations and other civil society organizations.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nDuring  implementation,  the  Project  will  maintain  broad  stakeholder  participation  in  its  activities.  At  the  national  level,  the \nproject  will  organize  workshops  to  develop  understanding  among  relevant  stakeholders  from  the  Ministry  of  Public \nEducation,  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  the  central  teacher  training  institute,  oblast  teacher  training  institutes,  and  relevant \neducation administrations, on strategies to further improve and complement the current in-service teacher training based on \nexperiences gained at the pilot provinces and lessons learned from other development projects. The project will also apply \na participatory bottom-up approach by involving community members and school boards in school selection process under \nthe Project. Active community participation in school management and the design of after-school activities will ensure that \ntraining and social programs are demand-driven.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n                                            \n1  Based on 2003 data. \n2  Corniaga. 2003.

Universal  access  to \nbasic primary and secondary school education (grades 1\u20139) has been maintained, and the literacy rate is almost 100% for \nmen and women. According to the Household Baseline Survey (2001\u20132002) data, approximately 92% of men and 93% of \nwomen in the  25\u201334  year-old age group had some upper  secondary or higher levels of schooling. The Interim Report on \nWelfare  Improvement  Strategy  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  (2005)  showed  that  the  enrolment  rates  between  boys \n(90.9%) and girls (90.5%) are equal. However, the quality of education at all levels of education is not being maintained.  \n\nTo improve gender responsiveness, the Project will develop strategies for teacher training to address gender stereotypes in \ncurriculum and material development. The Project will ensure that girls and boys have equal access to all upgraded school \nfacilities and gain benefit from improved teaching. The project will also ensure equal gender representation in school boards \nand encourage both female and male adults to equally participate in school improvement, additional learning activities, and \nsocial events in communities. The improved in-service teacher training system, which is closer to schools and more flexible, \nwill  benefit  at  least  31,500  women  teachers  who  account  for  70%  of  the  teaching  force  in  project  schools,  with  far  more \nwomen  teachers  in  the  school  system  to  be  benefited  during  the  life  of  the  Project.  In  addition  other  issues  with  gender \nimplications to be monitored include the analysis of education materials for gender biases and the stereotyping of women. \n\nA consultant with gender expertise will be recruited to develop a plan of action identifying specific activities, targets and \nreporting mechanisms for the implementation of the strategies listed above. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.

The Project will not require any land acquisition and \nrelocation.  \n\nAll project activities will be implemented through existing structures \nof the education sector and thus they  will become an integral part \nof  their  normal  plan  of  activities.  Further,  the  Government  has \ncommitted  to  increase  allocations  for  O&M  of  rehabilitated  and \nupgraded  school  facilities  under  the  project.  The  implications  for \nthe recurrent education budget are insignificant.  \n \nThe  Project  has  no  negative  impact  on  the  labor  market  or \nretrenchment. Social safeguards on labor issues are not applicable \nfor the Project. \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nThe Project will provide reading materials to libraries of selected \nschools for students of other local languages of instruction\u2014\nincluding Karakalpak, Kazakh, Korean, Kyrgyz, Russian, Tajik, and \nTurkmen. In addition, the Project will conduct in-service training for \nthese language teachers and allocate certain slots for in-service \ntrainings in the local language of teachers. Details will be agreed \nupon during the project implementation and in relation to the \nnumber of ethnic minority teachers.  \nThe Project will encourage school communities to provide support \nto socially and economically marginalized children and ensure their \naccess to quality education.    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\nNPBED = National Program for Basic Education Development, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nItem \n\nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit\nSUM1.00\n$1.00\n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 26 September 2007) \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "sum (SUM) \n$0.0008 \nSUM1,275.03 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nexecuting agency \nEducation Sector Development Program \ngross domestic product \ngross regional product \nhuman resources development \ninformation and communication technology \nInformation and Communication Technology in Basic Education Project \nmonitoring and evaluation \nMillennium Development Goal \nmanagement information system \nMinistry of Public Education \nMinistry of Senior Secondary and Higher Education \nnongovernment organization \nNational Program for Basic Education Development \nNational Program on Personal Training \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance management system \nproject steering committee \nSchool Development Fund \nsenior secondary education \nSecond Textbook Development Project \ntechnical assistance \nteacher training institute \n", " \nGLOSSARY \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ADB \nEA \nESDP \nGDP \nGRP \nHRD \nICT \nICTBEP \nM&E \nMDG \nMIS \nMOPE \nMOSSHE \nNGO \nNPBED \nNPPT \nO&M \nPIU \nPPMS \nPSC \nSDF \nSSE \nSTDP \nTA \nTTI \n", "mahalla \noblast \nraion \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "a community-based body of citizen self-management \nprovince \ndistrict \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  31  December.
