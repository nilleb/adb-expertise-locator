I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and (ii) a proposed grant to the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Capacity Building for \nHIV/AIDS Prevention Project. The report also describes proposed administration of technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the \nPacific1 for  Regional  Capacity  Development  for  Strengthened  HIV  Response.  If  the  Board \napproves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project2 will support the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam to strengthen \nthe regional HIV response by addressing current gaps in effectively reaching high-risk and \nvulnerable populations in border areas along economic corridors in the GMS. The aim is to \ndevelop national and regional capacity to mitigate HIV risks and vulnerability resulting from \nincreased mobility, migration and rapid economic development in the region.3 The project will \nfurther enhance regional HIV response capacity, including strengthening regional cooperation \nand targeted interventions for migrants and mobile populations in cross-border areas. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  The  GMS  is  a  fast-growing  subregion  in  terms  of  economic  development.  GMS \ninvestments in transport corridors and trade agreements have improved regional connectivity \nand integration, thereby attracting more investment and facilitating the movement of people and \ngoods across borders. Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment programs continue to give \nhigh  priority  to  supporting  enhanced  connectivity  as  a  driver  of  continued  economic \ndevelopment in the GMS. Better regional connectivity and economic integration also increase \nmobility and migration, which contribute to increased HIV risks and vulnerability, especially \nalong newly developed economic corridors with high population mobility.4 The epidemics in the \nregion are mainly driven by key populations with high-risk behaviors\u2014such as injecting drug \nusers, female sex workers (FSWs) and their clients, and men who have sex with men5\u2014whose \nmembers are being increasingly drawn to border regions alongside migrant labor to benefit from \nnew opportunities. This mobility is associated with the development of new concentrations of \nhigh-risk and vulnerable groups; the risk of transmission expands to their intimate partners, \nthereby increasing the risk that HIV prevalence will increase instead of being contained. \n \n4.  The HIV epidemic in the GMS is diverse. The epidemic varies in prevalence and nature \nacross the countries, and occurs in pockets within countries. The border regions include the \nmost  physically  and  socially  isolated  and  least  economically  developed  communities,  and \ncontain the highest concentrations of poorly educated people who have limited knowledge and \nawareness of HIV risks; they also have very limited access to services. Increasing injecting drug \n                                                \n1  Contributor: the Government of Sweden. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB 2010.

Manila. \n3  Vulnerability refers to unequal opportunities, social exclusion, and other social, cultural, political, and economic \nfactors that make a person more susceptible to HIV/AIDS. The factors underlying vulnerability may reduce the \nability of individuals and communities to avoid HIV risk. \n4  ADB. 2007.

Asia-Pacific  Regional  Review  of  HIV,  2010. \nhttp://www.aidsdatahub.org/dmdocuments/Asia_Pacific_Regional_Review_2010.pdf  ", "2  \n \nuse, high degree of mobility in the region and convergence of economic development in the \nborder areas6\u2014such as hotels, casinos, plantations, and special economic zones\u2014are growing \nrisk  factors  that  require  more  effort  to  sustainably  decrease  the  burden  of  HIV/AIDS.  An \ninadequate HIV response will continue to offset the gains made to date in poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth as a result of investment in infrastructure and regional integration.  \n \n5.  The HIV epidemic in Viet Nam remains in a concentrated stage with the adult HIV \nprevalence at 0.45% in 2011.7  There are signs that it may have begun to stabilize during 2010\u2013\n2011,8 however, according to 2011 sentinel surveillance, HIV prevalence remains high among \nFSWs (3%), injecting drug users (13.4%), and men who have sex with men (16.7%). Viet Nam \nis committed to halting and reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, and the fifth draft of the Viet Nam \nNational HIV/AIDS Strategy aims for nationwide prevention and care coverage, and reaching all \ncommunes. Due to resource constraints, the focus to date has been on targeting high-risk \npopulations in the major cities and urban centers, where the HIV prevalence is higher. However, \nthe epidemic has spread to all districts, and is increasing in particular in border districts. The \nextent of the potential for growth in the epidemic is uncertain due to weak surveillance systems. \nAs of 31 December 2011, there were 197,335 reported cases of people living with HIV. Officials \nin Viet Nam agree that a large number of people living with HIV may be missed, in particular in \nborder districts that lack the effective surveillance systems.  \n \n6.  In the Lao PDR, HIV prevalence in 2011 remains low (0.2%) in the adult population, but \nthis does not translate to a low risk. The Lao PDR is surrounded by countries with higher HIV \nprevalence. Increased mobility across borders coupled with the existing risks and vulnerability \nfrom  commercial  sex  and  the  emergence  of  high-risk  populations  creates  a  high-risk \nenvironment, especially in the border districts.9 In response to its precarious HIV situation, the \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  provided  strong  political  commitment  to  a  multi-sectoral \nresponse with support from international and national partners. Priorities include establishment \nof legislation; focused resource generation for expansion of HIV prevention, care and treatment \nprograms to targeted populations; and strengthened civil society participation in HIV response. \n \n7.  Three main gaps that need to be addressed to contain the epidemic have been identified \nas  common  to  the  existing  systems  in  both  countries.10 First,  current  health  systems  are \ninefficient in effectively planning and managing HIV/AIDS response due to the limited capacity \nof health staff at provincial and local levels, and weak monitoring and surveillance systems for \nHIV transmission at the village level; to address this, new investment and capacity building are \nneeded to increase health expenditure, strengthen system planning and management, and \nexpand human resources and skills. Second, access to quality prevention and care services \ncontinues  to  be  a  major  concern  for  people  vulnerable  to  HIV  transmission,  because  of \ninadequate equipment and medical supplies and a shortage of trained health staff to provide \nquality  services;  in  response,  investment  needs  to  be  directed  to  tackling  inequity  and \nimbalances in service delivery in the poorer districts, and to continue modernizing service \ndelivery models to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Third, awareness of HIV risks among \nhigh-risk and vulnerable populations, including migrants and mobile populations, remains low \n                                                \n6 United Nations Regional Taskforce on Mobility and HIV Vulnerability Reduction in Southeast Asia and Southern  \nProvinces in China. 2008.

With the many shared borders and rapid growth in infrastructure and mobility in the \nGMS, the governments are recognizing the need for stronger regional cooperation. Leaders of \nthe  GMS  countries  have  given  high  priority  to  the  control  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  signed  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  in  December  2011 for Joint  Action  to  Reduce  HIV \nVulnerability Related to Population Movement in the GMS. A multisectoral approach to tackling \nHIV/AIDS is being promoted in the GMS countries, with HIV/AIDS integrated into broader health \nstrategies as well as other sector strategies (e.g., for infrastructure and transport).  \n \n9.  Both the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam continue to be highly dependent on \ndonor assistance to finance system development and some recurrent costs, and supplement \ncapital investment. Support from bilateral partners has been declining, and as external aid  for \nHIV response is scaled back, it is essential to give renewed priority to new systemic capacity \ndevelopment to support future sustainability. Both governments seek to decentralize the HIV \nresponse to the local level in order to provide more effective services, but lack the knowledge, \nmanagement skills and systems, and resources to implement decentralization effectively.  \n \n10.  Since 1997, ADB has supported several HIV prevention projects in the GMS, some in \nassociation with infrastructure projects. Outputs have ranged from support for community-based \nHIV prevention to regional policy development for cross-border cooperation, with a particular \nfocus on regional aspects of HIV, including migrants and mobile populations, large construction \nsites, and source communities of migrants.11 GMS projects have supported the development of \ntargeted  prevention  messages  to  ethnic  minority  communities,  especially  in  remote  and \ncross-border areas,12 to a youth-focused project in Viet Nam,13 and to regional communicable \ndisease control projects.14 Since 2008, regional TA has supported the development of a regional \npolicy for cross-border collaboration and implementation of HIV prevention packages associated \nwith a number of GMS transport projects.15 The projects and TA have expanded the knowledge \nbase for actions in these areas and provided ADB with experience in effective regional and \ncountry-level HIV programming.  \n \n11.  Important lessons have been learned in implementing HIV/AIDS-specific projects, and \nhealth projects in general. These projects demonstrated the importance of targeting vulnerable \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n ", "4  \n \ngroups using a comprehensive community-based approach. ADB supports a comprehensive \napproach to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support delivered across a continuum \nfrom  hospitals to communities,  and  works  closely  with  development  partners to  assist the \ngovernments to adopt harmonized HIV prevention activities. It is important to mainstream HIV \nstrategies into ministerial plans and to integrate HIV project activities into annual operational \nplans  to  improve  results  and  sustainability.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional \nCommunicable  Disease  Control  Project  (footnote  14)  was  instrumental  in  strengthening \nprovincial capacity for timely outbreak control for avian influenza and dengue, reducing the \nburden  of  neglected  tropical  diseases,  and  tackling  HIV/AIDS  and  improving  regional \ncoordination. The project will benefit from existing project management capacity and regional \ncooperation  mechanisms  developed  by  the  Second  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional \nCommunicable  Diseases  Control  Project  (footnote  14)  to  reduce  start-up  delays.  Regional \ncooperation and knowledge management will further strengthen institutional capacity of the \nministries of health (MOHs) in both countries. \n \n12.  HIV/AIDS prevention has been identified as a priority regional public good by Strategy \n2020.16 The project is fully in line with the ADB's Strategic Directions Paper on HIV/AIDS 2011\u2013\n201517 and supports mitigation of HIV/AIDS risks and vulnerabilities along economic corridors, \nwhich is one of the three priority areas for ADB\u2019s HIV/AIDS response in the region. The project \nis aligned with the operational plans for health and transport18 to support social sustainability \nand social risk mitigation associated with transport operations. Furthermore, addressing health \nand other social issues associated with subregional connectivity is identified as one of the \nstrategic pillars for ADB's regional cooperation business plan for the GMS, 2012\u20132014.19 The \nproject  is  anchored  on  the  overall  objective  of  the  MOU  for  Joint  Action  to  Reduce  HIV \nVulnerability Related to Population Movement in the GMS,  and ADB is actively supporting \nimplementation through various GMS initiatives, along with other development partners (i.e., \nJoint United Nations Programme on AIDS, the United Nations Development Programme, the \nWorld Health Organization, the International Organization for Migration, the Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development,  and  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency). The project aims to address a critical gap in the current response to HIV (which is \nlargely  focused  on  national  HIV  response  systems)  by  enhancing  the  regional  response \ncapacity to effectively reach migrants and mobile populations, who face increased risk and \nvulnerability in a rapidly changing social and economic environment in the GMS.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  project  impact  is  to  contribute  to  achieving  and  sustaining  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Lao PDR \nand Viet Nam. The expected outcome of the project will be increased coverage and quality of \nservices for targeted populations in 23 border provinces.20 The project has four outputs.21 \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The MOH in each country will be the executing agency. Each executing agency has \noverall responsibility for project implementation, regional cooperation, coordination, and liaison \nwith ADB and other development partners. A regional steering committee will be established. It \nwill be chaired by the vice minister of the host country, and consists of the vice health ministers \nof Viet Nam and the Lao PDR, directors from the Lao Authority for the Department of Planning \nand International Cooperation and the Center for HIV/AIDS, and from the Viet Nam Authority for \n                                                \n22 Inclusion of taxes and duties on all ADB-financed expenditures is confirmed if (i) the amount of taxes and duties is \nwithin the reasonable threshold identified in the country partnership strategy of each country, (ii) the amount does \nnot represent an excessive share of the investment plan, (iii) taxes and duties apply only in respect to ADB-\nfinanced expenditures, and (iv) financing of the taxes and duties is materially relevant to the success of the project. \n ", "  7\n \nHIV/AIDS Control and Center for HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infection (STI), project directors \nfrom the MOHs; and representatives of ADB and the United Nations technical agencies. The \nproject  will  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with  development  partners.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).23 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2017 \nloan and grant closing date  June 2018 \nManagement   \n  (i) Oversight bodies  (i) Viet Nam: MOH review meetings chaired by the vice minister of health or the director of \nVAAC; and including heads of departments, and representatives of other ministries.  \n(ii) Lao PDR: MOH review meetings chaired by the vice minister of health or director \ngeneral of DPI and including heads of departments and representatives of other \nministries; technical experts by invitation of members. \n(iii) Regional steering committee, chaired by the vice-minister of health of the host \ncountry, consists of representatives of participating countries and ADB.  \n  (ii) Executing agencies  Ministry of Health (each country) \n(iii) Key implementing   (i) Viet Nam: Hanoi School of Public Health; 15 target provincial health departments; and \n      agencies  (ii) Lao PDR: CHAS, 8 PCCAs \n  (iv) Project               (i) Viet Nam PMU in the VAAC; and  \n        management units  (ii) Lao PDR: Department of Planning and Finance, MOH \nProcurement  International  (i)Viet Nam: 4 contracts  (i) Viet Nam: $7.48 million \ncompetitive bidding  (ii)Lao PDR: 0 contract  (ii)Lao PDR: $0.00  \nNational competitive  (i)Viet Nam: 3 contracts  (i)Viet Nam: $0.84 million \nbidding  (ii)Lao PDR: 0 contract  (ii)Lao PDR: $0.00  \nShopping  Multiple (Lao PDR/Viet Nam)   \nConsulting services  International (CTA,  (i)Viet Nam: 1 contract  (i)Viet Nam: $45,000 \ngender specialists,  (ii)Lao PDR: 3 contracts  (ii)Lao PDR: $314,000 \ntechnical advisory) \nIndividual selection  (i)Viet Nam: 8 contracts  (i)Viet Nam: $436,000 \n(ii)Lao PDR: 7 contracts  (ii)Lao PDR: $378,000 \nQCBS national  (i)Viet Nam: 5 contracts  (i)Viet Nam:  $290,800 \n(ii)Lao PDR: 2 contracts  (ii)Lao PDR: $154,000 \nAdvance actions  Selection of chief technical advisor and national consultants \nPreparation of bidding documents for the first 18 months \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the governments and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CHAS = Center for HIV/AIDS/STI, CTA = chief technical advisor, DPI = Department \nof Planning and International Cooperation, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, MOH = Ministry of Health, \nPCCA = Provincial Committee for the Control of AIDS, PMU = project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection, VAAC = Viet Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control. \nSources: Governments of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, and Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n21.  ADB  will  provide  capacity  development  TA  for  Regional  Capacity  Development  for \nStrengthened  HIV  Response  and  to  support  HIV  service  delivery  for migrants  and mobile \npopulations in high-risk settings at cross-border areas in the Lao PDR and Viet Nam. The TA \nwill also support knowledge-sharing activities involving neighboring countries in the region. The \nTA  is  closely  linked  with  ADB\u2019s  initiatives  to  building  regional  capacity  to  reduce  HIV \nvulnerability in the GMS. The outcome will be a strengthened regional HIV response system. \nThe TA will have three outputs: (i) capacity building for regional planning and management of \nHIV programs, (ii) pilot-testing of service delivery models for improved access to and quality of \n                                                \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8  \n \nHIV services for migrants and mobile populations at border areas, and (iii) shared knowledge on \nregional cooperation on HIV prevention and management.24 \n \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nCooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (footnote 1), and administered \nby ADB. The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation and local transport, the value of which is estimated at 15% (in-kind) of the total \nTA cost. Individual consultants (60 person-months, including 20 person-months of international \nand 40 person-months of national consultant services) and a nongovernment organization or \nfirm  will  be  engaged  to  support  planning,  implementation,  coordination,  and  monitoring  of \nregional HIV initiatives. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over \n24 months, commencing in January 2013 and ending by December 2014. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n23.  Technical  challenges  include  (i)  strengthening  regional  cooperation  and  knowledge \nmanagement  on  a  sustainable  basis;  (ii)  access  to  border  districts  and  communities;                \n(iii) community-based BCC and care; and (iv) integrating cross-border cooperation, training and \nsocial  safeguards  in  provincial  planning  and  budgeting.  The  project  provides  for  capacity \nbuilding and initial support in these areas, and also includes several assurances. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Benefits include a decrease in the burden of HIV, and improved overall health status of \npeople in participating provinces and districts. Other benefits come from lower private and public \nhealth expenditures, including indirect costs resulting from reduced morbidity and productivity \ngains from increased lifespan and reduced mortality. Poor and vulnerable populations, including \nethnic groups living in border areas, will particularly benefit. The project is pro-poor in its focus \non delivering and expanding healthcare services in districts and communes. The estimated \neconomic internal rate of return is 14.3% for the Lao PDR and 12.7% for Viet Nam, with benefits \nderived from reduced medical treatment costs and productivity losses.25  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  The  MOHs  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam  have  gained  substantial  experience  in \nimplementing  ADB-assisted  projects,  and  have  staff  with  skills  and  experience  in  ADB \nprocedures. The financial management assessments confirmed that each MOH has adequate \ncapacity for financial management for project implementation. There were no major governance \nissues during the implementation of other ADB financed projects. Staff will be provided with \norientation courses in governance. The governments will maintain a project website and post all \nprocurement activities on this website. ADB's specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the governments. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n                                                \n24 Technical Assistance: Regional Capacity Development for Strengthened HIV Response Project (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  9\n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.   Poverty and social impacts. The targeted border districts have a high proportion of \nfamilies living below or near the poverty line who depend heavily on the availability within the \nfamily of a healthy labor force. Life-threatening disease or death in families creates deeper \npoverty. Populations in border districts are increasingly vulnerable to the risk of communicable \ndiseases, and have less information and access to services to reduce the risks. By helping \nimprove regional health and economic security, the project will protect the poor against HIV-\nrelated catastrophic events, and improve their health, learning and productivity.26    \n \nE.  Gender impacts \n27.   The key gender impacts of the project include (i) an inclusive and participatory approach \nto developing local HIV/AIDS interventions; (ii) increased awareness by health staff of the key \ngender issues and enhanced capacity at the provincial and district levels to provide HIV and STI \nservices; (iii) increased knowledge among FSWs, female migrants, and ethnic women on HIV \ntransmission and means of prevention; and (iv) an increase in the number of at-risk females \ntested  for  HIV  infection.  The  gender  action  plans  for  both  countries  ensure  that  (i)  the \nvulnerability mapping and knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys will integrate gender issues \nand  report  sex-disaggregated  data;  (ii)  gender  issues  related  to  high-risk  groups  will  be \nintegrated into all training and BCC materials developed; (iii) 100% of female managers will be \ntrained on planning and management tools; (iv) 50% of local staff will be trained on HIV and STI \nservices  are to  be female;  (v) mobile  clinic  services  will  be  provided  in  sites  with  a  high \nconcentration of FSWs and migrant women, as well as for remote ethnic populations; and (vi) all \nquality  assurance  tools  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  integrate  gender  issues  and \nindicators, and assess gender sensitive service delivery and monitor the number of women \naccessing HIV services. The gender action plan is aligned with national- and sector-specific \ngender equality commitments in the Lao PDR and Viet Nam.27 The project is classified as \nhaving gender equity as a theme. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n28.   The project includes a significant proportion of ethnic groups among its beneficiaries, \nwho are among some of the poorest and most marginalized households in the Lao PDR and \nViet Nam. The ethnic groups plan28 ensures ethnic peoples\u2019 needs will be analyzed and they will \nparticipate  in  and  have  access  to  project  benefits.  Key  features  of  the  plan  include                      \n(i) consultation with ethnic groups on the development of provincial HIV plans, (ii) mapping of \nrisk behaviors of ethnic groups by gender and age, (iii) integrating ethnicity issues and needs \ninto all training and BCC materials developed for service providers and ethnic populations, (iii) a \ntarget of 100% participation of ethnic health staff at all levels in any training provided by the \nproject, and (iv) monitoring of the proportion of ethnic people accessing services relative to the \ntotal population of the ethnic community. The project is classified as category B for indigenous \npeoples, and category C for environment and involuntary resettlement. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.29 \n                                                \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Indigenous Peoples Plan: Ethnic Groups Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInability to reach target  Map risk populations and design appropriate interventions. \npopulations  Use appropriate interventions and mode of delivery based on pilot testing. \nInadequate focus on  Provide training on the results-based approach. \nachieving results  Link investments with results through AOPs.   \nWeak implementation  Strengthen PMU and implementing agencies. \ncapacity   Ensure timely availability of consultants, regular supervision and reporting. \nInsufficient effort in regional  Hold regular meetings of project managers and cross-border provinces.          \ncooperation   Provide expert support through capacity development TA.   \nLengthy administrative  Provide staff training; support also provided through experts and ADB. \nprocedures   Ensure support of core ministries and provinces for timely processing. \nPoor governance and  PMU and implementing agencies receive training in anticorruption policies. \ncorruption  ADB and PMU conduct spot-checking. \nProject investments not  UEnsesu inrete prvuebnlicti ovnissi bthiliatyt  aorfe t haeff oprrdoajebclte  afondr  tihtse  apcrotivviitniecse.s .                                      \nsustained  Ensure mainstreaming and funding of project activities in AOPs. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AOP = annual operational plan, PMU = project management unit, SOE = \nstatement of expenditures, TA = technical assistance, VHW = village health worker. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.
