THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Strengthening Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance \nFund  Limited  Project.1 The report  also describes  the  proposed  administration of  technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund2 \nfor Capacity Development of the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the TA. \n \n  The objective of the project is to support public\u2013private partnership (PPP) initiatives to \naddress infrastructure development deficits. As the country starts to recover from the severe \nimpacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, PPP will emerge as an important tool \nto leverage private sector resources to  develop infrastructure and create jobs. The project \ncomprises a financial intermediation loan to support the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund \nLimited (BIFFL) in financing selected PPP subprojects,3 and TA to strengthen BIFFL\u2019s institutional \ncapacity and to support PPP project implementation. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Infrastructure Gap Impedes Economic Development \n \n  Bangladesh\u2019s recent economic development has been strong. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) grew at an average rate of 7.0% per annum during 2012\u20132019.4 Bangladesh is on track to \ngraduate from the United Nations\u2019 least-developed countries in 2024.5 Rapid economic growth \nhas  increased  the  demand  for  energy,  transportation,  and  urban  development.  However, \ninfrastructure development has yet to catch up, creating a bottleneck that prevents the economy \nfrom reaching its full potential. The World Economic Forum highlighted weaknesses in the \nenabling environment in the country, particularly with infrastructure. The country was ranked \n114th out of 141 countries in terms of infrastructure in the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report.6 \nSignificant weaknesses were noted in road infrastructure, train services, seaport services, and \nwater utilities. Easing infrastructure constraints is critical to improving the competitiveness of \ndomestic industries and the overall efficiency of the economy. \n \n  The Government of Bangladesh has increased infrastructure investments since fiscal year \n(FY)2016. According to the government\u2019s 7th Five Year Plan (FY2016\u2013FY2020), infrastructure \nfinance needs to reach 4.2% of GDP per annum, or about $14 billion (FY2019), to maintain the \ngrowth momentum. Since FY2016, gross fixed capital investment consistently accounted for more \nthan 30% of the government budget. Nevertheless, the country\u2019s mostly public-sector-driven \ninfrastructure development is constrained by the resource availability as well as implementation \n \n1  The Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund  Limited (BIFFL) is an eligible financial  intermediary  per Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). 2003.

Among  key  indicators  under \ninfrastructure, road connectivity ranked 117, electricity access 108, and exposure to unsafe drinking water 136. ", "2 \ncapacities. The budget deficit was 5.5% of GDP in 2019, limiting further increases in infrastructure \ninvestments. Because of capacity constraints, many projects experienced implementation delays \nand cost overruns, resulting in reduced benefits from the projects. \n \n  The infrastructure sector comprises energy, power, transport, urban, education, and \nhealth sectors. More prominently, the Strategic Transport Plan 2015\u20132035 proposes five mass \nrapid transit systems, two bus rapid transit systems, three ring roads, eight radial roads, and six \nexpressways, among others.7 According to the Revisiting The Power System Master Plan 2016, \nto meet up future demand and maintain reserve margin, the country\u2019s generation capacity needs \nto increase by 74.5 gigawatts from 2020 to 2041. From 2017 to 2025, an average investment of \n$9\u201310 billion per annum is needed, for aggregated generation, transmission, and related costs.8 \nThe government plans also call for increased investments in economic zones and the urban, \nhealth, and tertiary education sectors. \n \n2.  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Plays  a  Critical  Role  in  Infrastructure \nDevelopment \n \n  International experience has shown that PPP is an effective tool to leverage private sector \nresources to address the public investment gap in infrastructure. Aside from mitigating the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal constraints, with proper designs PPP can also serve to provide incentives for \nprivate sector participants to optimize long-term value for money of projects, bring greater \nefficiency in public service delivery, and introduce advanced technologies and business practices. \n \n  Recognizing the great potential of PPP, the government has mainstreamed PPP in the \neconomic planning process. Under this process, public infrastructure projects are (i) developed \nby line ministries and/or local governments; (ii) screened by the Bangladesh PPP Authority9 and \napproved by the Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs, chaired by the minister of finance; (iii) \nfunded by the PPP Unit of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) (e.g., viability gap fund or other \navailability payment support); and (iv) supported by external transaction advisers, such as the \nOffice of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In addition, \na PPP policy, PPP law, viability gap fund guidelines, and procurement guidelines have been \ndeveloped  and  promulgated.  PPP  tool  kits  and  templates  of  legal  agreements  are  being \ndeveloped.  The  government\u2019s  commitment  to  PPP  is  also  demonstrated  through  the \nestablishment of a separate PPP budget for loans and equity, viability gap funding, and TA. \n \n  The government has envisioned that PPP will eventually support a substantial portion of \ninfrastructure investments, especially in the transport and energy sectors. According to the \nseventh five year plan, PPP investments in the transport sector alone shall reach 1% of GDP. \nTotal investment needs in the energy sector are more than 2.5% of GDP per year, and one-third \nof that will also be from the private sector, primarily through PPPs. For the transport and energy \nsectors alone, the total demand for PPPs is up to $5 billion per year. The development of the \neighth five year plan (FY2021\u2013FY2025) is yet to be completed, but the government has reaffirmed \nthat the PPP initiative will be a crucial long-term strategy in developing the transport, energy, \nurban, water, and information and communication technology sectors.10 As of February 2020, the \nPPP Authority had a pipeline of 72 projects with an estimated investment value of $22.7 billion at \n \n7  Government of Bangladesh. 2015.

Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2021\u20132041. Dhaka. \n ", "3 \ndifferent stages of development. Most of the PPP projects are in the transport, energy, and social \ninfrastructure sectors, which includes health care, economic zones, and tourism. \n  \n  Despite the progress made, PPPs have yet to deliver on their full potential. During the \nseventh five-year plan period, 16 PPP contracts totaling $4.9 billion were signed, which is below \nthe government target. PPP has gained some ground in power sector, especially in the private \nsector-led independent power producer subsector. Large-scale infrastructure PPP projects in \nother sectors such as transport have yet to take off. The main constraints are the lack of \nexperience by line ministries to develop and structure large-scale complex PPP transactions and \nlack of long-term financing for large-scale PPP projects, especially in local currencies. 11        \n \n  Government-established public sector financing companies. To channel long-term \nfinancing  to  PPP  projects,  the  government  established  two  complementary  public  sector \ninfrastructure financial institutions: the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) in \n1997 and BIFFL in 2011. IDCOL lends primarily to independent power producers and other \ninfrastructure subprojects developed by private sector sponsors. BIFFL is mandated to provide \nlong-term local currency debt financing to subprojects developed by public sector sponsoring \nagencies, such as the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges; the Ministry of Shipping; and the \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources.12 As a nonbank financial institution fully owned \nby the MOF, BIFFL was established as an integral part of the PPP development institutions, \ntogether with the PPP Authority and the PPP Unit of the MOF. \n \n3.  COVID-19 Highlights Greater Importance of Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n \n  Impact on the economy and jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact \non the economy of Bangladesh. The International Monetary Fund projects that the country\u2019s \neconomic growth will weaken to 3.8% in FY2020, which would be the slowest growth rate since \n2002. ADB estimated that 1.4 million\u20133.7 million workers may lose their jobs and 13.0 million \npeople may fall back into poverty. The implementation of infrastructure projects is severely \naffected by the disruption to imports of machinery and materials, as well as by work stoppages. \n \n  Infrastructure development will play an important role in the economic recovery. \nThe economy after the pandemic will continue to face many challenges, with most economists \nexpecting a U-shaped recovery. The traditional economic growth drivers, such as domestic \nconsumption and exports, are expected to remain weak for an extended period. Therefore, in \naddition to its long-term economic benefits, infrastructure development will become a key driver \nin boosting aggregate demand and accelerating the revival of economic activity. Infrastructure \ndevelopment is also important for job creation, as construction tends to have a large employment \nmultiplier effect and provides jobs for the poor. Further, the pandemic highlighted significant \ndeficiencies in the country\u2019s health care system which will lead to increased investment needs in \nmedical infrastructure, such as hospitals and testing facilities. \n \n \n11 The lack of long-term taka funds is caused by a number of factors: (i) government securities and national saving \ncertificates, which have high returns, crowd out potential corporate or project bond issues; (ii) institutional investors \ncannot invest in corporate and project bonds because of regulatory restrictions; and (iii) limited secondary market \ntrading prevents the development of benchmark yield curves. For details, refer to the problem tree in the Sector \nAssessment (Summary): Finance (Infrastructure Finance and Investment Funds) (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n12 However, because of the limited PPP pipeline in the past, BIFFL has also been lending to non-PPP infrastructure \nand industrial projects similar to those funded by IDCOL. The project intends to support to refocus BIFFL to its core \nmandate of lending to support major infrastructure PPP projects developed by line ministries. \n ", "4 \n  Increased importance of public\u2013private partnerships in the context of COVID-19. \nBecause of the pandemic, the government has come under increasing fiscal pressures. In \nFY2020, the budget deficit is expected to remain elevated at 5.5% of GDP because of sharp \nrevenue reduction and escalating expenditures for health care, social protection, and economic \nstimulus. The tight fiscal conditions are expected to continue into FY2021. Budgetary priorities \nwill focus on public health, food security, and social protection. Per World Bank estimate, fixed \ncapital investment by the government is expected to decline from $8.4 billion in FY2019 to $5.7 \nbillion in FY2020 and $4.5 billion in FY2021.13 In this context, PPP will take on added significance \nin complementing public financing to support infrastructure development. Further, considering the \nimpact of the pandemic, investment on health care is expected to increase, and a major portion \nof this investment is expected to be funded by the private sector through PPPs. \n \n4.  The Project is Part of ADB\u2019s Long-Term Engagement on Public\u2013Private \nPartnership \n \n  ADB\u2019s past assistance. ADB has provided extensive support to the government for PPP \ndevelopment. First, during 2010\u20132014, ADB TA helped Bangladesh establish PPP institutions, \npolicies, and funding mechanisms, including the PPP Authority, the PPP Unit of the MOF, and \nBIFFL.14 Second, ADB\u2019s OPPP has been working closely with the  PPP Authority, with the \nassistance of ADB\u2019s Asia\u2013Pacific Project Preparation Facility,15 to provide support in relation to \nsector  reforms;  subproject  due  diligence  (e.g.,  financial,  economic,  technical,  legal,  and \nsafeguards); and roadshows, data rooms, and other bid preparation activities. With the expanding \nOPPP  transaction  advisory  mandates  to  help  the  PPP  Authority  tender  PPP  subprojects, \nespecially in roads and health care, a list of bankable PPP subprojects is being prepared.16 Third, \nADB has implemented three capital market development programs to Bangladesh\u2014in 1997, 2012, \nand 2015\u2014to address the lack of a long-term commercial debt market in the country.17 Fourth, \nADB has successfully supported IDCOL through three assistance programs\u2014approved in 2008, \n2013, and 2017\u2014to extend long-term infrastructure project loans.18 \n \n  The need for support. Given BIFFL\u2019s clear mandate to finance PPP infrastructure \nprojects,  supporting  BIFFL  will  be  an  important  and  integral  component  of  ADB\u2019s  holistic \nassistance to the government\u2019s PPP strategy. BIFFL is still a relatively new financial institution \nwith limited operational history and experience working with development partners. On the \ntechnical side, there is a need to strengthen BIFFL\u2019s institutional capacity to appraise PPP \ninfrastructure projects and assume credit risk, while facilitating the participation of local financial \ninstitutions. On the funding side, constrained by the lack of access to long-term financing, BIFFL\u2019s \ninvestments are mainly equity funded, and the very low leverage on its balance sheet limits its \nability to support more long-term infrastructure projects. Access to long-term financing is critical \nfor BIFFL to expand its operations. Going forward, BIFFL plans to mobilize $500 million of long-\nterm debt from development assistance, and attempt bond issuances to raise local currency funds. \nBIFFL has made  modest progress on this front, recently securing funding from the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) for energy efficiency projects. But BIFFL is still in need \n \n13 World Bank. 2020.The cursed blessing of public banks. Washington, DC. \n14 ADB.

In \nthis context, the government has requested a sovereign loan from ADB. \n \n  Market demand. The government envisioned that PPP would support up to $5 billion of \ninfrastructure investment annually. The size of BIFFL\u2019s loan portfolio was only $201 million at the \nend of 2018. Together with IDCOL\u2019s loan portfolio of $498 million and leveraged commercial \nfinancing, the total financing amounted to only $2.8 billion. BIFFL is building a promising PPP \nsubproject pipeline, supported by the PPP Authority, ADB\u2019s project team, and ADB\u2019s OPPP (see \ndetailed subproject assessment in para. 23 and the PPP subproject pipeline under the PPP \nAuthority referenced in footnote 16). With this backdrop, the demand for funds from emerging \nPPP subprojects may potentially increase, exceeding the $50 million loan to BIFFL. Should such \nfunding  requirements  materialize,  and  if  the  current  project  is  on  track  for  successful \nimplementation, ADB will consider providing additional financing to support these subprojects. \n \n  ADB\u2019s strategic context and policy framework. The project will help ease Bangladesh\u2019s \ninfrastructure financing constraint, a priority area in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013\n2020 for Bangladesh,19 and it is included in the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022.20 \nThe project is well aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.21 The project will \nhelp to alleviate poverty by creating jobs during both the construction and operation phases of the \ninfrastructure projects, especially for many low-skilled workers (Operational Priority 1). The project \nwill help strengthen governance and the institutional capacity of BIFFL(Operational Priority 6), \ntackle climate change by supporting the development of more efficient and environmentally \nsustainable  infrastructure  projects  (Operational  Priority  3),  and  support  gender  equality  by \nincorporating  gender  elements  in  project  implementation  and  capacity  building  activities \n(Operational Priority 2). Moreover, in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the project will help mobilize \nprivate sector financing and promote private sector development. Finally, to deliver integrated \nsolutions, the project will promote cross-sector, cross-theme, and cross-department collaboration. \nThe project was processed with support and consultation from OPPP during the design stage; \nthe subproject pipeline was developed based on existing and future OPPP transactions. By \nconnecting the regional department\u2019s financing to OPPP\u2019s transaction advisory mandates, the \nproject aims to deliver seamless support to the government\u2019s PPP strategy under the One ADB \napproach. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n  The project will support the government\u2019s efforts in strengthening BIFFL\u2019s institutional \ncapacity to develop PPP infrastructure projects. The support will help to restart infrastructure \ndevelopment, spur economic growth, and generate jobs during the recovery from the COVID-19.  \n \n  The project is aligned with the following impact: investment in infrastructure development \nincreased (footnote 5). The project will have the following outcomes: PPP infrastructure projects \nincreased, and new employment opportunities created.22 The outputs are (i) long-term debt to \ninfrastructure  subprojects  provided  and  (ii)  BIFFL\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  finance  PPP \ninfrastructure projects improved. \n \n \n19 ADB. 2016.

Through this output, BIFFL will provide long-term local currency financing for qualified \nPPP  infrastructure  subprojects.  ADB  financing  will  also  leverage  additional  private  sector \ninvestments in infrastructure project development.  \n \n  To be eligible for financing, subprojects must be developed by the PPP Authority and meet \nsubproject  eligibility  criteria  including  private  sector  ownership  of  the  infrastructure  being \ndeveloped, commercial viability, economic return, technical efficiency and compliance with ADB \nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements. Use of ADB financing for any subproject will \nbe subject to pre-approval by ADB to confirm satisfaction of the eligibility criteria. To manage risks \nand establish best practices, unless otherwise agreed, the first subprojects will be selected from \nPPP subprojects developed with the support of OPPP through its advisory services. \n \n  Output 2: Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited\u2019s institutional capacity \nto finance public\u2013private partnership infrastructure projects improved. The TA will (i) review \nand update BIFFL\u2019s business strategy, (ii) develop a comprehensive capacity building plan for \nBIFFL, (iii) strengthen the BIFFL safeguard unit and mainstream safeguard principles, and (iv) \nsupport the implementation of ADB-funded subprojects while providing hands-on training for the \nstaff. Overall, the TA will increase the capacity of BIFFL to screen, process, fund, and implement \nPPP infrastructure projects. It is expected that at least two PPP projects will be reviewed and \napproved by 2024, putting BIFFL on a sustainable path to achieve its mandate to support \ninfrastructure development. \n \n  Subproject pipeline. For the initial subproject pipeline, ADB and BIFFL have identified \nthe Dhaka Bypass Project and Rampura\u2013Amulia\u2013Demra Road Project, and OPPP has acted as \na transaction advisor for both. The concession agreement for the Dhaka Bypass Project was \nsigned in December 2018 and the financial closure is expected by August 2020. The Dhaka \nBypass Expressway Development Company is requesting a $122 million-equivalent taka loan \nfrom BIFFL, for which the preliminary term sheet has been signed. For the Rampura\u2013Amulia\u2013\nDemra Road Project, bids for the concession were submitted in July 2019 and the preferred bidder \nhas been selected with preliminary terms of contract signed. BIFFL is in discussion with the project \ncompany over a local currency financing  of $88 million. ADB\u2019s OPPP continues to develop other \nPPP projects, especially in the health sector, that may lead to additional pipeline subprojects. In \nDecember 2019,  ADB, the PPP  Authority, and  the  Directorate General of Health  Services \nexecuted a triparty memorandum of understanding, in which future PPP projects in medical \ndiagnostics  and  dialysis  centers  have  been  outlined  for  implementation  in  2020\u20132022. \nFurthermore, increased demand in the health care industry is expected as a result of the \npandemic. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n  The project will (i) provide critically needed capacity development and long-term funding \nto help BIFFL sustain and  expand its lending operations to PPP infrastructure projects, (ii) \ncatalyze greater private sector commercial infrastructure financing and investment, and (iii) \nfacilitate the financial closure of the first few large PPP infrastructure subprojects to help the rollout \nof the government\u2019s PPP strategy. Despite the relatively small loan amount, the project will help \nstrengthen BIFFL\u2019s institutional capacity and sustain its future PPP infrastructure project lending \ncapacity, including the introduction of international best practices in environmental and social \nsafeguards. On the funding side, taka-denominated long-term loans from BIFFL will help minimize \nthe foreign exchange risk of PPP infrastructure projects, which will enhance the economic viability \nof the projects. As the country is trying to recover from the impact of COVID-19, ADB\u2019s support \n ", "7 \nwill provide a  much-needed boost to the  country\u2019s  PPP  initiative  to  promote  infrastructure \ndevelopment. Based on the experiences gained from the long-term partnership with IDCOL and \nthe Indian Infrastructure Finance Company Limited,23 the project design prioritized and advanced \nthe institutional capacity development and subproject review to improve overall readiness. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n  The government has requested a regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year to be capitalized in \nthe loan; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n  ADB loan proceeds are intended to fund up to 30% of the total cost of subprojects to \nmaximize the leveraging of commercial finance. The project will leverage at least 20% of the total \nsubproject costs from private sector equity and the remainder from other commercial borrowing. \nNo more than 20% of the total loan amount will be used for retroactive financing, which could be \nused for refinancing costlier loans or loans with shorter maturities on eligible subprojects.24 \n \nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \nSourcea  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \n  Ordinary capital resources (regular loan)  50.0  100.0 \nTotal  50.0  100.0 \na Additional sources of financing will include private sector equity and commercial borrowing, the respective amounts \nof which will be determined individually for each subproject.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  Relending. The loan proceeds will be relent by the government to BIFFL through a \nsubsidiary loan agreement  in compliance with the  loan agreement between  ADB and the \ngovernment. The subsidiary loan will be denominated in taka and mirror ADB loan in tenor and \ngrace period. The relending rate will be guided by MOF relending rates for public investments.25 \n \n  Onlending.  BIFFL will onlend the loan proceeds through subloans to qualified enterprises \ncarrying out eligible subprojects. The subloans will be commercially priced and reflect BIFFL\u2019s \ncost of funds and subproject-specific risks. The funding support will leverage additional private \nsector investments including foreign direct investments to infrastructure projects. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  The Finance Division of the MOF will be the executing agency and BIFFL will be the \nimplementing agency. The implementation period will be 4 years from 2020 to 2024. BIFFL will \nestablish a project management unit with staffing and other resources satisfactory to ADB and \nensure  compliance  with  the  project  implementation  requirements  stipulated  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM)26 and legal agreements. The implementation will also be guided by \nthe environmental and social management system (ESMS) arrangement.  \n \n23 Lessons from Other ADB Financial Intermediation Loans to Support Infrastructure Development (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Incurred before loan effectiveness but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. \n25 Recent MOF relending rates for funds from development partners to BIFFL have been fixed rates in the range of 1\u2013\n2%. \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2020\u2013August 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  28 February 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance (Finance Division) \n(ii)  Implementing agency  BIFFL  \n(iii)  Implementation unit  The project management unit within BIFFL will have five full-time staff who will \ncarry out the implementation of the project. The unit will also be supported by \ntechnical experts funded by the technical assistance and BIFFL funds. \nProcurement  The  subborrowers  will  follow  the  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices in procuring goods and services using the proceeds of the loan, in line \nwith the core principles of the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time), and in a manner acceptable to ADB. \nRetroactive Financing  Retroactive financing will be provided to subprojects that were approved by ADB \nfor expenses incurred by the subborrowers not more than 12 months prior to the \ndate of the loan agreement. The subprojects must meet the same subproject \neligibility criteria set out in this report and recommendation of the President and \nthe PAM (footnote 26). The total amount of retroactive financing will not exceed \n20% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, and BIFFL and \nADB. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BIFFL  =  Bangladesh  Infrastructure  Finance  Fund  Limited,  PAM  =  Project\nAdministration Manual. \nSources: ADB, BIFFL, and Ministry of Finance. \n \n  COVID-19 impact on implementation. The government gradually lifted closures and \nmovement restrictions since 31 May 2020. Logistical issues and work stoppages have delayed \nall infrastructure projects for 3\u20134 months. PPP subprojects under consideration for the project will \nproceed as planned. These are all long-term projects where the private sector has entered with a \nlong-term view of risks and returns through multiple economic cycles. The pandemic does not \nalter the economics of the road projects or cost estimates. For the Dhaka bypass subproject, after \n3 months of delays both the government and the project company are eager to move forward, \nwith the financial closure in August 2020. For the country, PPP road subprojects such as the \nDhaka Bypass Project bring in much-needed private sector investments and provide jobs for \nmany non-skilled workers at a time of economic slowdown. Further, the pandemic has highlighted \nthe importance and enhanced the feasibility of health sector projects in the government\u2019s PPP \npipelines. \n \nIII.   ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n  TA is attached to the project to help BIFFL improve its institutional capacity and to support \nproject implementation. The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Special  Fund.27 TA  funds  will  be \ndisbursed  in accordance  with the Technical  Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). All consultants shall be recruited in accordance with  the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and associated project administration \n \n27 Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. Administered by ADB. \n ", "9 \ninstructions and TA staff instructions. The TA will support (i) corporate strategy review and \ndevelopment; (ii) capacity development assessment and development, including in funding, \ntreasury  operations,  PPP,  and  credit  and  risk  management;  (iii)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; and (iv) ADB project implementation. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n  ADB\u2019s due diligence consists of detailed country, macroeconomic, infrastructure sector, \nand BIFFL operational assessments to ensure the success of this project. In particular, ADB has \nconducted  a comprehensive assessment of BIFFL\u2019s operational capacities in terms of deal \norigination, credit risk assessment, treasury and funding, human resources, and other internal \nprocesses and procedures, and found them to be adequate to operate commercially. Since BIFFL \nhas no prior experience in implementing ADB-funded projects, the TA will be crucial in enhancing \nits capacity in safeguards and compliance. Integrity due diligence has been conducted, and no \nsignificant or potential integrity risks were identified. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n  ADB guidelines stipulate that the most important criteria for determining the standing of \nfinancial intermediaries are capital adequacy, asset quality, management  quality, earnings, \nliquidity, and sensitivity to market risk, or the CAMELS rating model.28 BIFFL has demonstrated \nsatisfactory ratings on these indicators. However, ADB\u2019s evaluation confirmed that BIFFL\u2019s capital \nstructure  is  underleveraged,  which  depressed  both  lending  volume  and  earnings.  BIFFL\u2019s \noperational performance can be improved with higher leverage, particularly with more long-term \ndebt. Since most of the likely future PPP subprojects are in the road subsector, an analysis of the \neconomic viability of  recent completed road  projects in Bangladesh financed by ADB  was \nconducted. The analysis showed satisfactory economic internal rates of return ranging from \n17.5% to 28.6%. Economic returns of each subproject will be evaluated during the subproject \napproval process when all required information becomes available. After the onset of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, some PPP projects have experienced delays in financial closure because of \nshutdowns, but most of the PPP infrastructure projects will continue to be implemented. Long-\nterm infrastructure projects under consideration are expected to generate economic returns \nacross economic cycles and are often used as a tool of countercyclical stimulus. \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n  The  project  is  expected  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of  BIFFL\u2019s  operations,  both \nfinancially and institutionally, as the ADB loan will provide long-term debt to sustain BIFFL\u2019s \ncapital structure and funding, and the TA will provide institutional capacity building to help BIFFL \nexpand its operations in a sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s long-term funds will help BIFFL mobilize \ngreater private sector finance and facilitate infrastructure and PPP sector development. The \nsupply of long-term ADB funds to the Bangladesh financial system will also give rise to additional \nappetite for similar long-term debt instruments and facilitate the development of the long-term \nbond market. The environmental and social safeguards and other international best practices \nestablished under the TA will help BIFFL gain better access to additional development assistance \nfrom other international lenders in PPP infrastructure projects. \n \n \n28 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila (Section 6.4. Assessing FI Performance). \nFollowing the CAMELS framework, a financial institution is assessed by its Capital adequacy, Assets quality, \nManagement quality, Earnings and Liquidity.  \n ", "10 \nC.  Governance \n \n  As a fully  government-owned public sector financial  institution,  BIFFL  has a strong \ngovernance structure. The board of directors includes nine members, with the secretary of the \nFinance Division (MOF) as the chair. Among the board members are the secretary of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office; the secretary of the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources; and the \nsecretary of the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges. BIFFL plans to appoint an additional \nindependent board member from the private sector. Critical committees\u2014such as the audit \ncommittee,  management  committee,  credit  risk  management  committee,  and  asset\u2013liability \nmanagement committee\u2014have been established and are functioning well. \n \n  Financial  management.  BIFFL  has  established  well-defined  financial  management \nprocedures and guidelines and is compliant with Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards and \nBangladesh Accounting Standards. BIFFL has qualified staff in accounting, finance, asset and \nliability management, internal controls and audits, and reporting functions. BIFFL has had prior \nexperience implementing projects with international lenders such as JICA and the World Bank, \nthrough which its financial management capacity has been evaluated and enhanced. The overall \nfinancial management control risk is moderate. \n \n  Procurement and disbursement. BIFFL will monitor the subproject procurement by \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All PPP subprojects are \nrequired to  undergo  a bidding process, in accordance with the  government\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines for PPP Projects, 2018.29 BIFFL will also require concessionaires to ensure that prices \nare reasonable and that relevant factors, e.g., time of delivery, efficiency, reliability, and suitability \nfor the subproject, are considered. The recommended project procurement classification is B. \n \n  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and BIFFL. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n  The project will increase Bangladesh\u2019s infrastructure investments to improve access to \npublic services, create jobs, enhance economic efficiency, and reduce poverty in subproject areas \nand in the country. The construction and future operation and maintenance work could potentially \nprovide direct local employment benefits, including to the poor and vulnerable groups in the \nsubproject construction areas. The project will ensure social safeguard compliance in terms of \ninvoluntary resettlement, indigenous people\u2019s policy, core labor standards, and Bangladesh\u2019s \nlabor legislation. Women will benefit from the project through capacity development of BIFFL\u2019s \nstaff under the TA or schemes to improve women\u2019s access to local labor market opportunities \nfrom the infrastructure subprojects funded by BIFFL. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows:30 \n \n \n29 Government of Bangladesh. 2018. Procurement Guidelines for PPP Projects, 2018. Dhaka. \n30  ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n ", "11 \n  Environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples (category FI). The \nproject is classified category FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nUnder the project, BIFFL will consider PPP infrastructure subprojects screened by the PPP \nAuthority and as advised by ADB\u2019s OPPP. These subprojects may include roads and highways \nwith potential significant environmental and social impacts. Screening and review of subprojects \nto be considered by BIFFL will follow the procedures indicated in the ESMS arrangement, which \nis based on ADB\u2019s SPS. The ESMS arrangement has been disclosed on the ADB website as \nrequired by ADB\u2019s SPS and Access to Information Policy 2018. \n \n  Given the nature of the subprojects, some could potentially be category A for environment \nand/or involuntary resettlement. Subprojects that may be category A for indigenous peoples will \nbe avoided. In case this cannot be avoided, the ESMS arrangement provides guidance on how \nto conduct due diligence  and mitigate potential risks. The safeguard categorization of the \nsubprojects recommended by BIFFL will be reviewed and cleared by ADB before subproject \napproval to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s SPS. The environmental impact assessment, the \nresettlement plan, and the indigenous peoples plan will also be reviewed by ADB to ensure that \nthey are compliant with ADB\u2019s SPS. \n \n  ADB reviewed the institutional capacity of BIFFL in managing potential environmental and \nsocial  impacts associated with the subprojects. Currently, BIFFL has designated staff who \noversee  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards  of  their  projects  and  are  supported  by \nenvironmental consultants engaged for projects with the World Bank and JICA. Since this will be \nthe first ADB project for BIFFL, its staff received SPS training conducted by ADB in August 2019.31 \nThe institutional capacity building of BIFFL on environmental and social safeguards (including \nlabor management) will be further supported by the TA. The TA will provide the necessary \ncapacity development and technical support to improve the structure and implementation of the \nESMS arrangement and eventually integrate them into the BIFFL\u2019s institutional environmental \nand social safeguard management framework. BIFFL has demonstrated commitment to working \nwith ADB in meeting the requirements of its SPS and following other international best practices \nin managing environmental and social risk impacts of identified subprojects. \n \n  Climate change risk assessment. Subprojects that will be considered for ADB funding \nwill be reviewed on their climate change risk which could be low, medium, or high. Subprojects to \nbe considered will not be expected to have medium or high climate change risk. If these cannot \nbe avoided, a climate change assessment report with climate adaptation/mitigation options will \nbe included and will be cleared by ADB before subproject approval. \n \n  Following the process for financial intermediation loans, climate adaptation and mitigation \nbenefits can be estimated only upon  ADB\u2019s realization of  each subproject financing. If  all \nsubprojects are in the roads and highways subsector, the climate adaptation and mitigation impact \nwill be limited to about 10% of the total ADB project cost incurred in raising road levels, improving \ndrainage systems, and/or additional slope protection. \n \nF.
