The Project will assist \nthe  project \nthe  district \nimplementation  offices  (PIO)  within \ngovernments  to  build  their  management  capacities  and  support \nthe  creation  of  synergies  between  government  and  civil  society \nthrough partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs) \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n \nFactors  constraining  the  ability  of  rural  households  in  Sindh  to \nmake significant improvements in their livelihoods are diverse and \ninterdependent.  Major  characteristics  of  rural  poverty  pertain  to \nthe  complex  social,  cultural,  legal,  and  political  environment  with \nthe  existing  feudal  relationship  between  landlords,  tenants,  and \nlandless  laborers  at  its  core.  A  sharecropping  tenancy  system \nprevails  in  the  canal-irrigated  areas  of  the  four  project  districts. \nTenancy  arrangements  leave  little  room  for  the  tenants  to  take \ndecisions. Changes over time in the tenancy system have been to \nthe disadvantage of the tenants. The chances of tenants incurring \ndebts  with  the  landlord,  which  they  are  not  able  to  repay  at  the \nend  of  a  production  cycle,  are  high.  The  tenants  become \n\"bonded\",  in  the  sense  that  their  right  to  move  and  seek \nemployment  freely  is  restricted  until  the  debts  are  settled.  The \nSindh  Tenancy  Act,  1950,  enacted  to  regulate  the  tenancy \narrangements  and  protect \nis \nhampered by low levels of compliance. \n \nAdditional  key  constraints  limiting  the  livelihood  enhancement \nopportunities of the poor are extremely low levels of literacy; lack \nof access to extension service and appropriate technologies, and \nto formal credit; and deficient community infrastructure. \n \n\nthe  cultivators, \n\nthe  rights  of \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nthrough \n\nincreasing  empowerment  and \n\nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  in  the  canal-irrigated  areas  of \nBadin,  Mirpurkhas,  Sanghar,  and  Thatta  districts  in  southern \nSindh \nimproving \ngovernance, improving access of the rural poor to public services, \ntransferring  technology  for  improved  livelihoods,  and  providing \nessential infrastructure. The objective of the Project is to improve \nthe social status and economic well-being of the poorest groups in \nthe  project  area  with  a  focus  on  the  following  target  groups  (i) \ntenants  and  agricultural  laborers,  (ii)  marginal  owners-cum-\ntenants,  and  (iii)  small  village-based  artisans.  There  will  be  a \nparticular focus on women as the most disadvantaged among the \ntarget  groups.  The  objective  will  be  achieved \nthrough \nimplementation  of  the  following  five  components  (i)  improved \ngovernance  and  legal  support,  (ii)  enhanced  social  processes  at \nthe community level, (iii) improved rural livelihoods, (iv) upgraded \nrural  infrastructure  and  settlement  improvement,  and  (v)  project \nmanagement  support.

The \n2. \nagriculture sector contributes about 25% of gross domestic product, is the source of 74% of exports,2 \nand  provides  direct  employment  for  about  44%  of  the  workforce.  Despite  the  introduction  of \nmacroeconomic  structural  reforms  in  the  latter  half  of  the  1990s,  there  are  major  concerns  about \nagricultural productivity and growth, with sector growth of about 3.7% only just exceeding population \ngrowth of 2.5% annually over the past decade. The rural, nonfarm sector is a major contributor to the \neconomy, but performance in this sector has been equally restrained. This has adversely affected the \nlivelihoods and growth prospects for all 68% of households living in the rural areas of the country. \nMajor challenges remain if real economic and social progress is to be attained, including (i) reducing \npoverty,  (ii) improving  governance,  (iii) extending  fiscal  reforms,  (iv) improving  the  balance  of \npayments  situation,  (v)  restoring  investor  confidence,  (vi) accelerating  economic  growth,  and \n(vii) improving social indicators.  \n \n3. \nPoverty  in  Pakistan  has  a  significant  rural  dim ension, and addressing the poverty situation \nrepresents a major policy focus into the next decade. Levels of poverty fell during the 1980s, while the \nnumber of poor more than doubled during the 1990s. The number of poor was estimated in June \n1999 as 45 million or one third of the population, in 6.3 million households.3 Of these, 33 million or \n73% (4.7 million households) are estimated to live in rural areas. These figures, significant as they \nare, mask the actual extent of poverty in rural Pakistan as \u201cpoverty\u201d is now recognized as not merely \nan  income-related  phenomenon.  Poverty  is  also  reflected  in  deprivation  of  key  quality  of  life \nopportunities,  with  feelings  of  vulnerability  and  powerlessness  the  most  important  intangibles  that \nshape the lives of the poor. The denial of people\u2019s basic rights by public officials, nonimplementation \nof protective measures and legislation, substandard service delivery, and a lack of access to fair and \naffordable  grievance-settlement  mechanisms,  including  courts,  all  further  exacerbate  feelings  of \nvulnerability.  \n \n4. \nPoverty levels are high in Sindh: 37% of the population live below the poverty line; 20% of the \nurban  and  53%  of  the  rural  population  are  poor.4 While economic growth in the farm and nonfarm \nsectors is a necessary condition for improving rural livelihoods, this growth must have a core pro-poor \ndimension  if  it  is  to  generate  significant  improvements  in  the  livelihoods  of  the  agricultural \ncommunities in rural Sindh (Appendix 1). Here, structural rigidities, imbalance in access to resources, \nthe  differential  impacts  of  the  introduction  of  new  technologies,  weak  governance,  and  a  lack  of \nempowerment constrain any benefits of sector economic growth from \u201ctrickling down\u201d to the majority \nof the population, which consists of the over half of households that do not own agricultural land, and \nthe further one quarter of households that own 2 hectares (ha) or less.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  was  provided  under  (i)  ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  to \nPakistan for Preparing the Sindh Rural Development. Manila; and (ii) ADB. 2001. Small-Scale Technical Assistance \n(SSTA) to Pakistan for the Additional Preparatory Work on the Sindh Rural Development Project. \n\n2  Made up of exports of agricultural commodities (13%) and exports of agricultural manufactured products (61%). \n3  The reviewed official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories per adult/day (2,150 calories for urban adults, 2,450 \ncalories  for  rural  adults),  PRs670  per  capita  per  month,  and  $0.56  per  capita  per  day  based  on  the  average \nexchange rate for 1998/99. \n\n4  Head count, estimated from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 1996/97 records.

March. \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n5. \nThe  four  districts  (of  Badin,  Mirpurkhas,  Sanghar,  and  Thatta)  have  a  combined  rural \npopulation of about 4.6 million in 0.8 million households, or 27% of the rural population of Sindh \nprovince.  Poverty  is  widespread  throughout  the  four  districts.  According  to  nationwide \ncomparative  rankings  of  social  indicators,  none  of  the  four  districts  was  found  in  the  first  or \nsecond quartile, two were in the third, and two were in the bottom quartile. Badin appeared as the \npoorest  district  in  Sindh.  Health  and  education  indicators  are  very  poor.  Adult  literacy  rates  are \n10.5%  for  women  and  34.7%  for  men.  Rural  link  roads  are  in  urgent  need  of  upgrading.  Only \n10.5% of the rural population has access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Drinking water is \nthe  major  expressed  need  of  the  rural  poor.  Women  participate  in  agricultural  work,  are  fully \nresponsible for the livestock, and manage the household and children, but are largely bypassed \nby extension services. Levels of household indebtedness are high.5 Technologies, transportation, \nand  market  linkages  are  also  very  poor.  This  situation  is  compounded  through  insufficient \nsupplies of irrigation water to meet demand, droughts, and other natural calamities.  \n \n6. \nA  majority  of  rural  households  in  the  four  districts  do  not  own  agricultural  or  homestead \nland. Tenant farms alone represent 44% of all private farms. Of those who do own land in rural \nareas, fewer than 20% are large landlords6 but this group owns over 60% of the private farms.7 \nThe existing sharecropping tenancy system, concentrated in the canal-irrigated areas of the four \ndistricts, is historically deep-rooted and perpetuates the deeply entrenched poverty of tenants and \nagricultural labor through unbalanced revenue-sharing and cost-sharing arrangements (Appendix \n2,  paras.  11\u201313,  Table  A2.2)  and  a  complex  system  of  dependencies.  Changes  over  time,  the \ninflux of migrants, and the introduction of modern technologies have altered the relationship to the \ndisadvantage  of  the  hari.8  The  landlord  meets  the  haris\u2019  needs  (e.g.,  for  agricultural  inputs, \nconsumption,  social  events,  emergencies)  through  advances,  with  the  accounts  of  these \ntransactions  kept  by  him,  and  often  not  transparent.  However,  even  if  these  accounts  were \nmanaged openly, haris\u2019 extremely low literacy rate would inhibit their control over the entries. The \ndebt accumulates over the years. Haris cannot leave the landlord without clearing their debt, and \nbecome bonded.9 The bonded labor issue is politically sensitive and discussing it has frequently \nbeen  interpreted  as  threatening  the  existing  power  structure.  Innumerable  dialogues  between \nvarious actors10 indicate some inclination to begin changing the system.  \n \nThe existing legal framework provides the basis for such changes and most of the relevant \n7. \nlegislation is in place, though sometimes  outdated. The Constitution of Pakistan, 1973; the Bonded \nLabour System (Abolition) Act, 1992 (BLA) and implementing Rules, 1995; and several international \ntreaties  that  Pakistan  has  ratified\u2014all prohibit forced labor in any form. Applicability of the BLA  to \nagricultural labor is under review. The main law governing land and land revenue administration is the \nLand Revenue Act, 1967 and its implementing Rules, 1968 (LRA). The Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950 \n(STA)  is  arguably  the  most  important  for  the  haris.  The  Act was an attempt to address issues of \nsecurity of tenure, and define the tenant\u2019s share of the agricultural produce and the responsibility for \n                                                 \n5  For example, a survey of 136 households in six villages in Sanghar revealed that 83% of households had outstanding \n\nloans at an average of PRs14,000.  \n\n9 \n\n6  With at least 10 ha of land. \n7  Agricultural Census 1990. More recent data are not yet available. \n8  The  Sindh  Tenancy  Act,  1950  (STA)  uses  the  terms  hari  and  tenant  synonymously  defining  a  tenant  as  a  person  who \npersonally cultivates the land of another person (the landlord). This document uses the term hari for a tenant/sharecropper. \n\u201cBonded labor\u201d refers to a laborer who has forfeited the right to move and to seek employment elsewhere because of \ndebt incurred with a creditor; in agriculture, most often with the landlord. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, \n1992 provides a long definition.  \n\n10  The  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  is  currently  implementing  a  subregional  project  on  debt  bondage. \nNongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  especially  the  Human  Rights  Commission  of  Pakistan,  started  advocacy \nactivities against bonded labor in the early 1990s. An important part of SSTA 3725-PAK (footnote 1) was discussion \non this issue with a variety of stakeholders in the project area. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ninputs.11  The  Acts  no  longer  reflect  contemporary  circumstances  and  needs,  and  the  level  of \ncompliance  is  low.  Considerable  substantial  and  procedural  gaps,  in  particular  regarding  record \nkeeping and grievance settlement, exist. The Federal and provincial governments are making efforts \nto  improve  the  situation.  The  Federal  Government\u2019s  National  Policy  and  Plan  of  Action  for  the \nAbolition  of  Bonded  Labour  and  Rehabilitation  of  Freed  Bonded  Labourers  is  currently  being \nimplemented.  The  Action  Plan  of  the  Taskforce  for  the  Improved  Implementation  of  the  Land \nRevenue Act (2001) includes the maintenance of revenue and survey records, computerization, and \ntraining  of  revenue  staff.  Amendments  to  the  tenancy  legislation  and  to  its  implementation  and \nsupervisory mechanism are of paramount importance for improvements in rural livelihoods.12  \n \nGovernance  has  emerged  as  one  of  Pakistan\u2019s  foremost  development  concerns.  On  14 \n8. \nAugust 2001, a new integrated three-tier local government system was installed. The Government is \nrelying on its devolution program to promote competition, ownership, and accountability in the delivery \nof  public  services,  and  on  the  active  involvement  of  people  in  community  issues.  This  is  a  major \nopportunity  for  more  people-centered,  rights -  and  responsibility-based  government  structures,  but \nrisks relate to weak technical and institutional capacity to handle the diverse set of functions involved, \nthe  reluctance  of  provincial  governments  to  devolve  administrative  and  financial  powers,  and  the \nlikelihood  of  control  by  local  elites.  The  large  group  of  the  rural  poor,  particularly  women,  is  only \nminimally represented in civil society organizations, and the rural poor lack the power to exercise their \nbasic  rights  or  to  access  public  services.  Community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  will  have  to \nincrease their efforts to enhance social processes. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are required \nin supporting the interests and developing the capacities of CBOs. A comprehensive study of NGO \nand CBO capacities13 shows that NGOs in Sindh have demonstrated their capacity to work in difficult \ncircumstances  and  remote  areas. However, their area coverage is limited, while cooperation with \neach other and with government, as well as their managerial capacities, need to be further developed.  \n \n9. \nThe design of the Project in southern Sindh therefore takes into consideration (i) the complex \nsocial, cultural, legal, and political environment, in particular the feudal relationship between landlords, \nharis, and landless laborers; (ii) the importance of confidence building and awareness raising of legal \nrights and obligations among beneficiaries, landlords, and local government, and of compliance with \nexisting  legislation;  (iii) the  need  to  address  key  constraints  limiting  livelihood  enhancement \nopportunities of the target population (e.g., levels of literacy, access to appropriate technology, and \ncommunity  infrastructure  needs);  (iv) the  overall  capacity  of  the  Sindh  government  and  the  new \ndistrict governments, NGOs, and other agencies, and the need for clear definition of their roles and \ncoordination between concerned agenc ies; and (v) appropriate arrangements for the management of \nthe Project, taking into account the devolution process.  \n \nImportant aspects therefore incorporated in the design of the proposed Project include (i) the \n10. \ncritical  need  to  address  the  power  imbalance  between  different  stakeholder  groups  as  a  key \nimprovement  in  governance;  (ii) social  mobilization  of  beneficiary  groups  to  enable  adoption  of  a \ndemand-driven  approach  to  village  development  and  livelihood  improvement;  (iii) increased \nbeneficiary participation, including that of women, in the identification, construction, and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of facilities; (iv) support from experienced NGOs and district government offices \nin a partnership approach to project implementation; and (v) the need to plan and implement project \nactivities at the local level.  \n \n                                                 \n11  Further analysis is provided in Supplem entary Appendix A. \n12  In the context of SSTA 3725-PAK (footnote 1) appropriate amendments to the STA and its implementing Rules have been \nprepared  and  were  discussed  in  a  series  of  intensive  consultations  leading  to  section-by-section recommendations for \namendments. Stakeholders in the project area recognized that the lack of accurate account keeping is the basis of many \ncontroversies and disputes, and needs to be addressed on a priority basis. Promulgation of amendments to the STA and of \nthe Sindh Tenancy Rules, 2002 was a condition for loan negotiations. \n\n13  This study was undertaken as part of SSTA 3725-PAK (footnote 1) and is provided in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n11. \nDuring the 1990s, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other funding agencies had varied \nand  extensive  involvement  in  the  agriculture  and  rural  development  sector.  These  interventions \n(Appendix 3) aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting market-oriented policy reforms, \nstrengthening  the  institutional  framework,  and  developing  resource-scarce  areas  of  the  country. \nExperience suggests that, generally, project impact is reduced when there is an inadequate focus on \nconsultation with beneficiaries, ownership, flexibility in project design, sequencing and prioritization, \ncapacity, centralized controls, dysfunctional systems of the project implementing agencies, and post \nproject O&M.14 Therefore, the Project ensures (i) fuller participation of beneficiaries in project design \nand  implementation  leading  to  greater  ownership,  (ii) a  process  approach,  (iii) decentralized  and \nlocalized implementation arrangements with capac ity support to government and community groups \nin implementation and maintenance, and (iv)  use of robust technology. \n \n12. \nThe Project is in line with the Government\u2019s vision and development goals articulated in the \nTen-Year  Perspective  Development  Plan  2001-11  and  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.15  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy  is  based  on  Pakistan\u2019s  development  goals  and  priorities  for  poverty  reduction.  It  also \nincorporates ADB\u2019s overarching development objective of poverty reduction and lessons learned from \npast operational experience in Pakistan. Recognizing that greater participation of people requires a \ncivil  society  able  to  take  over  responsibilities  within  an  environment  conducive  to  opposition  and \ndiffering  opinions,  the  Project  combines  interventions  to  improve  livelihood  and  services  with \nmeasures empowering the target groups through improved laws,  better compliance with legislation, \nand improved access to justice. \n \n13. \nThe  Project  is  complementary  to  four  ongoing  ADB  loans  and  two  pipeline  projects.  A \nprogram  to  improve  agriculture  sector  productivity  and  profitability  is  being  implemented,  and  a \nmicrofinance  facility  is  just  commencing.16  Some  major  governance  issues  in  a  legal  context  are \nbeing addressed, the rural access road network of Sindh is being improved, and the access to the \npublic  elementary  school  system  in  Sindh  is  being  increased.17  One  other  project  to  support  the \ndevolution process of the Government is in preparation.18  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe overall goal of the Project is to reduce poverty in four districts in southern Sindh through \n14. \nincreasing  empowerment  and  improving  governance,  improving  access  of  the  rural  poor  to public \nservices, transferring technology for improved livelihoods, and providing essential infrastructure. The \nobjective of the Project is to improve the social status and economic well-being of the poorest groups \nin  the  project  area19  with  a  focus  on  the  following  target  groups  (i) haris and agricultural laborers, \n(ii) marginal  owners-cum-tenants  (with  less  than  2  ha),  and  (iii) small  village-based artisans. There \nwill be a particular focus on women as the most disadvantaged among the target groups.  \n                                                 \n14 For this reason, ADB. 2002.

There are five components (i) improved governance and legal \nsupport,  (ii) enhanced  social  processes  at  the  community  level,  (iii) improved  rural  livelihoods, \n(iv) upgraded rural infrastructure and settlement improvement, and (v) project management support. \nSpecific project interventions are targeted toward women. \n \n\n1. \n\nImproved Governance and Legal Support \n\n \n16. \nThe Project will strengthen its investment components and community-based improvement of \nrural livelihoods through a rights-based approach to development. This will be done by (i) improved \nrecognition  of  and  compliance  with  stakeholders\u2019  rights  and  obligations,  (ii) capacity-building and \ninstitutional  support  for  district  government  and  other  stakeholders,  and  (iii) review  of  relevant \nlegislation.  \n \n17. \nThe  Project  will  assist  in  preparing  and  implementing  a  large-scale  awareness-raising and \nknowledge-dissemination campaign on issues such as the amended tenancy legislation, land revenue \nlegislation and forms, debt bondage, the importance of registration as a tenant, and national identity \ncards (NICs). The campaign will include the translation of relevant legislation into local languages, \nmedia  campaigns,  and  community-based  training  and  workshops  with  relevant  stakeholders, \nincluding vigilance  committees.20  To  improve  access  to  the  justice  system,  the  Project  will  train \nparalegals, directly support the provision of legal advice, and facilitate legal-aid referral initiatives.  \n \n18. \nOne of the main areas of contention with regard to the implementation of the STA is the lack \nof proper account keeping between landlords and haris. The Project will develop, demonstrate, and \nutilize  a  simple  account-keeping  system  in  the  project  area,  including  the  replication  of  account-\nkeeping  materials.  The  am ended STA  gives  the  responsibility  for  hearing  tenancy  disputes  to a \nrevenue officer at a higher level. The success of this will be evaluated in year three of the Project \n(para. 58).  \n \nCivil  society  will  actively  monitor  project  activities  in  this  component,  in  particular  the \n19. \nissuance of NICs and  sanads (property deeds) and the updating of land and tenancy records in \nvillages  where  improved  settlement  activities  are  undertaken.  The  monitors  will  have  access  to \nrecords of relevance to these  activities, including those relating to NICs, field books, and village \nforms of the revenue administration, and issuance of sanads by the Board of Revenue (BOR).  \n \n20. \nTo  address  the  low  level  of  compliance  with  the  LRA,  in  particular  the  updating  and \nmaintenance of land records, the Project will link with the government of Sindh's Action Plan for \nImprovement in Revenue Administration through training and the provision of enhanced mobility \nto improve supervision and verification of field records. The Project will train 575  tapedars21 and \nsupervisory  tapedars  in  the  preparation  of  land  and  tenancy  records.  In  addition,  the  proposed \nRevenue Academy or the National Institute for Public Administration will train 40  mukhtiarkars,22 \ndistrict  revenue  officers,  and  instructors,  who  in  turn  will  provide  further  training,  including \nrefresher  courses,  to  the  575  tapedars  and  supervisory  tapedars  at  the  Tapedar  College  or  the \nproposed  Revenue  Academy.  The  updating  of  land  records  will  be  evaluated  at  the  midterm \n\n                                                 \n20  Vigilance committees are established under the BLA at the district level and chaired by the zila nazim (mayor/head of \n\nthe district government).  \n\n21  Revenue collector at the lowest administrative level (deh) of the BOR. \n22  Administrator of the BOR at taluka or subdistrict level. \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nreview  of  the  Project.  Project  support  to  computerization23  will  be  conditional  on  the  extent  to \nwhich land records have been updated and maintained in the first 3 years of the Project. \n \n21. \nThe Project will also support the review of and, if needed,  the drafting of amendments to \nlegislation with a potential high impact on agricultural labor, including legislation on social security, \nworking  conditions,  minimum  wages,  the  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance,  and  other  labor-related \nlegislation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnhanced Social Processes at the Community Level \n\n \nThe population in rural Sindh is extremely scattered24 and lives in very small settlements. \n22. \nIn the four districts, only 35.2% of the rural population live in villages of 50 households and above \n(Appendix 5, Table A5.1). To improve outreach to the poor target population and assure effective \nuse  of  investments,  a  thorough  process  of  selecting  villages  for  project  interventions  will  be \napplied  (Appendix  5).  One  \u201clead\u201d  NGO  per  district  will  be  selected  to  support the CBOs in their \ncommunity  interventions.  A  more  intensive  level  of  intervention  will  be  applied  for  a  subset  of \nvillages  through  a  holistic  approach  to  improved  settlement  (village  planning,  small-scale \ninfrastructure, and village link roads).  \n \n23. \nThe process of selecting the groups of villages that will participate in the various levels of \nproject  activities  will  be  explained  and  discussed  in  two  workshops  in  each  district\u2014the first to \nintroduce the process and raise awareness of the issues, and the second to explain the selection \nprocess  and  the  results.  A  second  series  of  workshops  will  introduce  the  Project  to  CBOs \noperating in the area. Awareness-raising campaigns and delivery of services to village groups will \nbe  accompanied  by  an  intensive  process  of  practice-oriented  capacity  building  for  CBOs  to \nenable them to function more effectively, and to extend their outreach. It is expected that some \n640 CBOs will be directly strengthened, and that these will provide support and capacity-building \nservices to around 3,200 village groups (at least one third of them women\u2019s groups).  \n \nA  comprehensive  package  for  functional  and  numeric  literacy  will  be  developed, \n24. \nconsisting of state-of-the-art training manuals and teaching and learning materials (e.g., booklets, \nposters).  The  package  will  be  appropriate  for  the  training  of  head  trainers  from  each  district \ngovernment\u2019s new executive district office for literacy and the office for community development. \nHead trainers will provide training to trainers from the CBOs and the district government. CBOs \nand  the  district  government  will  provide  training  of  functional  and  numeric  literacy  for  village \ngroups. It is anticipated that head training programs will be organized around four workshops and \nabout 48 head trainers (24 of them female), followed by 32 district-level training programs, each \nwith  about  40  participants  (at  least  20  of  them  women)  attached  to  CBOs.  These  will  provide \nliteracy training to an estimated 3,200 village groups. \n \n\n3. \n\nImproved Rural Livelihoods \n\n \nIn  the  project  area,  wheat  is  the  predominant  crop,  followed  by  cotton,  rice,  and \n25. \nsugarcane. Southern Sindh is also a major producer of vegetable crops (onion and chilies) and \nfruits.  Marginal  farmers  tend  to  concentrate  on  wheat,  cotton,  rice,  and  fodder  crops.  Haris \nproduce  whatever  the  landlord  decides  on.  Livestock  production  is  an  important  element  of  the \nfarming  system  and  haris  and  marginal  farmers  keep  animals  as  part  of  their  subsistence \nstrategy. Improvements in rural livelihoods will be carried out through four main groups of needs-\nbased community activities (i) strengthening agricultural support services, (ii) improving livestock \nmanagement,  (iii) introducing  appropriate  farm  and  household  technologies,  and  (iv) improving \naccess to institutional credit.  \n                                                 \n23  The precise needs for computers and/or survey equipment will be agreed at the time of the midterm review. \n24  Overall, Sindh has 66,923 rural settlements. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n26. \nStrengthening  agricultural  support  services  will  incorporate  participatory  extension \ntechniques  backed  up  by  technical  training  in  crop  production,  livestock  management,  and \nimproved irrigation water use. This training will involve exposure visits for CBOs and staff of the \ndistrict government office for agriculture to provincial and national research institutes, followed by \nestablishing  1,600  demonstrations  in  villages,  together  with  a  similar  number  of  field  days. \nImproved  seed  will  be  introduced  in  the  project  area  and  its  multiplication  promoted  with  seed \nblocks established in 1,600 villages, along with associated training in the use and storage of the \nimproved seed. Improved milk collection systems will be introduced through visits to demonstrate \nthe  operation  of  comparable  systems  in  other  areas  of  Sindh  and  the  Punjab,  followed  by \nworkshops  organized  to  transfer  this  information  to  target  farmers.  In  addition,  the  Project  will \nprovide  resources  to  review,  improve,  and  distribute  extension  manuals  to  assist  and  support \nCBOs in agricultural and livestock extension.  \n \nTo improve livestock management (including the diagnosis of diseases) 300 youths selected \n27. \nfrom  the  target  villages,  as  village-based  livestock  workers,  will  be  trained.  Once  trained,  these \nworkers will provide their own villages and surrounding villages with information on improved livestock \nmanagement,  as  well  as  undertaking  fee-based services in disease prevention, diagnosis, and first \naid.  Linkages  with  Khushhalibank  (KB)  will  allow  these  workers  to  expand  their  operations.  In \naddition,  the  Project  will  target  village  women,  offering  training  in  livestock  management  through \n1,600 training workshops to be held in the villages, and 1,600 refresher courses. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  village-level  demonstrations  and  transfer  of  appropriate \n28. \ntechnologies  (e.g.,  energy-saving  stoves,  storage  facilities,  preservation  of  food)  for  individual \nhouseholds.  Demonstrations  of  appropriate  household  technologies  will  involve  1,600  village-\nlevel workshops. Training on appropriate technologies for vegetable gardening will be organized \nthrough  1,600  workshops,  and  information  on  interventions  proven  in  the  project  area \ndisseminated,  as  income-diversification  opportunities  will  be  shared  among  lead  NGOs  and \nCBOs through six annual workshops and 12 biannual district fairs. \n \nThe Project will develop and support the extension of linkages between the target groups \n29. \nand KB25 for credit. KB will have branches in each of the project districts by the end of 2002. Lead \nNGOs under the Project will apply to become KB service providers. They would link their partner \nCBOs to credit from KB, to meet the needs of the target groups. Orientation sessions for CBOs \nwill familiarize them with the procedural requirements of accessing KB funds. \n \n\n4. \n\nUpgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement \n\n \nA major component of the Project relates to upgrading rural infrastructure, carefully focusing \n30. \nactivities in locations impacting most on the target groups and following set criteria  (Appendix 5). To \ndeliver investments that benefit the target groups directly, the Project will only support subprojects \nprioritized through a participatory approach and reflecting needs identified by the communities. Roads \nto be improved under the Project will complement ongoing or planned road improvement projects in \nSindh.26  \n \n31. \nTwo types of rural roads will be upgraded under the Project. First, around 750 kilometers \n(km) of \u201cvillage link roads\u201d will connect selected villages directly to the district road or provincial \nhighway  network,  or  to  the  nearest  district  link  road  upgraded  under  the  Project,  or  to  another \n\n                                                 \n25  A  number  of  providers  of  microcredit  exist  in  the  project  area,  e.g.,  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  providing \nsubstantial  funds  to  NGOs  (e.g.,  National  Rural  Support  Programme  and  Sindh  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Workers \nCoordinating Organization) for onlending; Khushhalibank (KB), as part of Loan 1805/1806-PAK (footnote 16) started \nits lending activities in Sanghar in September 2001.  \n\n26  For  example,  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Road  Sector  Development  Program,  the  Khushal  Pakistan  Program,  and  a  program \n\ncurrently being formulated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nneighboring  village  itself  connected  to  a  district  link  road  improved  by  the  Project.  Second,  for \nselected  clusters  of  project  villages  interconnected  by  village  link  roads,  the  Project  will  provide \nfor some 200 km of bituminous \u201cdistrict link roads\u201d that will connect the cluster to the district road \nnetwork.  In  general,  district  link  roads  and  village  link  roads  will  follow  existing  alignments,  but \nwith flexible geometric design standards to avoid land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \n \n32. \nSettlement  infrastructure  improvement  will  enc ompass the provision/upgrading of domestic \ndrinking water supplies using different tested models such as shallow dugwells or small-scale tubewells \nconnected to hand pumps in fresh groundwater areas and reservoirs for surface water diverted from \nirrigation canals and subsequently filtered in saline groundwater areas. Wastewater drainage systems \nwill be upgraded and localized village infrastructure (e.g., village lanes) improved. The holistic model \nof  the  Sindh  Katchi  Abadis  Authority  (SKAA)27  will  use  participatory  processes  with  village-level \nplanning as an entry point to identify, prioritize, execute, and maintain subprojects. It is anticipated \nthat 450 smaller villages (of 50\u2013100 households) and 300 larger villages (of 100\u2013200 households) will \nbenefit from this subcomponent.  Sanads will be issued on completion of improvement works. \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Management Support \n\n \n33. \nProject  management  services  will  support  timely  implementation  (Appendix  6).  This  will \ninclude  (i) engaging  consultants  and  NGOs;  (ii) procuring  vehicles  and  equipment;  and \n(iii) establishing accounting, monitoring, and reporting systems.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n34. \nThe Project has a number of unique and important features of design and arrangements \nin  implementation  including  (i) clear  targeting  of  project  components  to  specific  beneficiary \ngroups; (ii) focus on women according to a clearly defined gender strategy and plan (Appendix 7); \n(iii) demand-driven  identification  and  prioritization  combined  with  a  spatial  planning  approach  to \nproject  interventions;  (iv) district  level  implementation  arrangements;  and  (v) a  partnership \nbetween government, NGOs, CBOs, and beneficiaries in project activities. \n  \n35. \nThe Project will apply a comprehensive set of selection criteria for its interventions to assure \noutreach  to  the  target  groups.  To  meet  spatial  concerns,  more  intensive  interventions  such  as \nsettlement infrastructure improvement, will only take place in villages meeting an additional set of \nsecondary criteria. These villages are considered as future \u201cgrowth poles\u201d, where services should be \nmore concentrated to attract people from the small and scattered villages (Appendix 5).  \n  \n36. \nProject  activities  are  programmed,  coordinated,  and  implemented  at  the  district  level  in \nsupport of the Government\u2019s devolution process, with project coordination being a provincial task. \nFunctions  of  detailed  planning,  preparing  annual  work  programs,  selecting  target  villages, \nimplementing  subcomponents,  and  monitoring  project  activities  will  be  at  the  district  level  and \nbelow.  Implementation  will  involve  a  partnership  between  a  lead  NGO  selected  for  each  district \nand the district government, while thematic NGOs, provincial agencies, and specialized institutes \nwill  provide  capacity  building  and  backstopping  as  required.  The  focus  is  therefore  on  capacity \nbuilding  at  the  district  level  of  both  NGOs  and  district  government,  with  strong  linkages  to  the \nCBOs, which are the focal point for both identifying needs and priorities, and for service delivery. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n37. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  about  $62.50  million  equivalent,  including \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost,  $10.65  million  (17%) \n\n                                                 \n27  Sindh Katchi Abadis Authority (SKAA) was established in 1987 as a semiautonomous organization; administratively it \n\nis under the Local Government Department.  \n\n \n\n\fcomprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $51.85  million  equivalent  (83%)  comprises  local \ncurrency  cost  including  taxes  and  duties.

The LGD will establish the provincial coordination unit (PCU) within the LGD in Karachi, and it \nwill be headed by a project coordinator supported by a full-time deputy project coordinator.28 The PCU \n\n                                                 \n28  It is understood that the project coordinator has already been appointed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nwill  provide  interagency  and  interdistrict coordination to project  activities of SKAA and at the district \nlevel. The PCU will primarily have a supportive and facilitation role and will be responsible for policy \nguidance, consultant/NGO recruitment, procurement,  consolidation  of  project  progress and financial \nreports,  and  support  monitoring  and  evaluation  as  well  as  ADB  review  missions.  The  PCU  will \nestablish its own work plan and include a work plan agreed with SKAA. An important responsibility will \nalso be facilitating the sharing of interdistrict experience and the identification of best practices and \nlessons learned. The PCU will serve as the secretariat of the steering committee and the focal point \nfor  liaison  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  It  is  anticipated  that  apart  from  the  deputy  projec t \ncoordinator,  the  PCU  will  have  a  full-time  professional  staff  of  three,  strengthened  by  15  person-\nmonths of international consulting services in management support. \n \n40. \nA provincial steering committee (PSC) will be established prior to loan effectiveness. It will \nbe  chaired  by  the  additional  chief  secretary,  planning  and  development  department,  with  the \nfollowing  members  (i) secretary  local  government;  (ii) secretary  finance;  (iii) secretary  labor; \n(iv) director  general  SKAA;  (v) the  four  district  coordination  officers  from  the  project  districts; \n(vi) appropriate  NGO  representation;29  (vii) one  KB  board  member;  (viii) project  coordinator; \n(ix) senior  chief  (poverty  alleviation),  planning  and  development  department;  and  (x) deputy \nproject  coordinator.  The  PSC  will  offer  guidance  on  legal  and  governance  initiatives,  resolve \ninteragency problems, and provide policy guidance as needed.30  \n \n41. \nA separate project implementation office (PIO) will be established in each district with the \ndistrict  coordination  officer  being  the  ex-officio  project  director.  The  executive  district  officer, \ncommunity development, will serve as the deputy project director with two full-time staff (project \nofficer  and  accountant),  support  staff,  and  facilities.  Other  officers  from  the  relevant  district \ngovernment  offices  will  liaise  with  the  PIO  as  needed.  This  structure  is  intended  to  ensure \nefficiency and control within the Project while fostering and maintaining clear communications and \neffective cooperation with the various entities involved in project implementation.  \n \n42. \nZila  project  committees  (ZPCs)  chaired  by  the  zila  nazim  will  play  an  active  role  in \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  Each  ZPC  should  comprise  the  district  coordination  officer,  the \nexecutive  district  officers  of  the  district  government  offices  for  works  and  services,  revenue, \nliteracy,  finance  and  planning,  community  development,  and  agriculture;  the  Project\u2019s  gender \nspecialist and representatives from SKAA, the lead NGO, and two thematic NGOs. The ZPCs will \nensure  that  all  components  are  implemented  efficiently  and  effectively  and  that  the  anticipated \noutcomes at district level are achieved. Specifically, the ZPCs will (i) endorse villages selected for \nproject  interventions  in  accordance  with  the  primary  selection  criteria,  (ii) review implementation \nof partnership arrangements with NGOs/CBOs, (iii) approve the annual work program and budget \nprepared  by  the  PIO,  (iv) review  and  approve  draft  quarterly  and  draft  annual  reports  to  be \nsubmitted  to  the  PCU,  (v) monitor  the  implementation  of  project  activities  and  outcomes,  and \n(vi) formulate  solutions  to  impediments  to  project  implementation.  The  project  organization  and \ncoordination chart is in Appendix 9. \n   \n\n2. \n\nProject Components \n\na. \n \n\nImproved Governance and Legal Support \n\n43. \nThe PCU will contract a public relations firm, a thematic NGO, or a specialized institute to \ndevelop an awareness-raising and dissemination campaign, including campaign materials. The public \nrelations firm, thematic NGO or ins titute  will orient the lead NGO and train staff of CBOs and selected  \n\n                                                 \n29  Two representatives of lead NGOs in each meeting will alternate with the representatives from the other two districts. \n30  It will meet as necessary, but not less than quarterly in the first 2 years of project implementation, and semiannually \n\nthereafter. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\ngovernment officials at the district and taluka levels on the content of the campaign and the use of the \nmaterials.  The  trainees  will  then  implement  the  campaign  with  the  lead  NGO  providing the overall \nguidance in each district. Each lead NGO will include male and female paralegals among its staff. The \nPCU  will  contract  a  thematic   NGO  or  specialized  institute  to  provide  intensive  training  to  these \nparalegals, both in the prevalent laws and how to provide legal advice. Paralegals will provide initial \nlegal advice, and if necessary, will link beneficiaries needing further legal assistance to lawyers who \ncan provide legal aid.31 A national human rights organization with extensive experience in political and \nlegal monitoring through core groups working at the field level, acceptable to the government of Sindh \nand  ADB,  will  be  invited  to  actively  monitor  project  activities.  The  monitors  will  be  provided  with \ntraining and allowances to cover travel costs by the project.  \n \n\nEnhanced Social Processes at the Community Level \n\nb. \n \n\nThe  PCU  will  contract  the  four  lead  NGOs  to  provide  linkages  with  district  and  provincial \n44. \ngovernments, and assure common understanding and coordinated service delivery.32 The PIO will \n(i) identify villages, together with the lead NGO, according to set criteria; (ii) coordinate between the \nProject,  CBOs,  and  target  groups;  (iii) identify  and  strengthen  CBOs  through  targeted  capacity-\nbuilding measures; (iv)  assist CBOs deciding to pursue registration as citizen community boards33 in \nthe formalities involved in the process; (v) establish mechanisms assuring information dissemination \nand timely provision of support; and (vi) assist in setting up a district-level system for monitoring and \nevaluation. Thematic NGOs will provide specialized inputs such as legal aspects, gender orientation, \ncapacity  building,  agricultural  and  livestock  improvement  training,  and  support  to  relevant  local \ngovernment  agencies  and  CBOs  as  identified  by  the  PIO  in  consultation  with  the  lead  NGO. \nConsultants in organization development will assist PCUs, PIOs, lead NGOs, and CBOs.34  \n \nCBOs  will  (i) identify  and  mobilize  village  groups;  (ii) build  community  links;  (iii) provide \n45. \nawareness-raising  and numeric and functional literacy classes; (iv) assist in regularizing tenure for \nhousing, in obtaining NICs, and in registering as tenants; (v)  assist village groups in obtaining support \nfrom  PIO  for  infrastructure,  agricultural  inputs,  livestock  improvements, and improved housing; and \n(vi) facilitate the introduction and multiplication of improved seed. The numeric and functional literacy \ncourses will be prepared with the assistance of a local consultant in cooperation with a thematic NGO \nand the local government. The lead NGOs and representatives from CBOs will assist in field-testing \ncourses and teaching material.  \n \n\nc. \n \n\nImproved Rural Livelihoods \n\n46. \nDistrict government offices and selected female lead NGO staff will be trained in participatory \nextension approaches and technical disciplines by specialized national and provincial institutes. The \ntraining  program  will  include  a  balance  of  participatory  extension  approaches  and  available \ntechnologies.  Through  NGOs,  these  trained  staff  will  be  used  as  trainers and resource persons to \ntransfer appropriate technology to the target group. Short-term consulting services will be provided to \nassist the specialized institute in developing and delivering the training program. The district government \noffice for agriculture and lead NGOs will implement those activities relating to agricultural and livestock \n\n                                                 \n31  The  Project  will  facilitate  access  for  legal  aid  referral  initiatives  to  the  Legal  Empowerment  Fund,  a  subfund  of  the \n\nAccess to Justice Development Fund under the ADB-funded Access to Justice Program. \n\n32  Detailed terms of reference for lead NGOs, including selection criteria, are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n33  Citizen  community  boards  are  voluntary  groups  of  non-elected  citizens,  registered  under  the  Sindh  Local \nGovernance Ordinance, 2001, for proactive, self-help initiatives in development and improvement of service delivery \nat  the  local  level.  Citizen  community  boards  are  funded  from  voluntary  contributions,  grants,  and  endowments  and \nreceive  support  from  the  local  government  through  matching  grants  of  up  to  80%  of  the  cost  of  a  project;  local \ngovernments are mandated to spend 25% of their development budgets through citizen community boards. \n\n34  The terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nextension.  To  further  support  agricultural  development,  the  PCU  will  recruit  consultants  to  improve \ntechnical manuals suitable for the target group, which the PCU will reproduce for distribution. \n \n47. \nThe Project will train village-based livestock workers using appropriate provincial institutes. In \naddition,  improved  livestock  management  training  for  women,  and  training  and  demonstrations  on \nimproved  crop  production  will  be  conducted  by  the  district  government  office  for  agriculture,  lead \nNGOs,  and  the  CBOs,  which  will  utilize  the  services  of  trainers  trained  through  the  Project  as \nresource  persons.  The  introduction  of  appropriate  household  technologies  will  follow  the  same \nimplementation pattern. The consultants recruited by the PCU will identify the technologies and will \ntrain  staff  of  relevant  district  departments,  of  lead  NGOs,  and  of  CBOs  as  head  trainers  who  will \ntransfer the technologies to the target group. \n \n\nUpgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement \n\nd. \n \n\n48. \nImplementation of the district link roads, which are selected by PIO in accordance with the set \ncriteria and which are included in the annual development plan of the district  government, will be the \nresponsibility of the district government office for works and services, which will (i) conduct feasibility \nstudies and prepare detailed engineering designs, quantities, cost estimates, and tender documents; \n(ii) award construction  works  to  prequalified  local  contractors  through  local  competitive  bidding; \n(iii) supervise  contractors  during  implementation;  and  (iv) organize  the  O&M  of  the  improved \ninfrastructure.35  Domestic  consultants  recruited  by  the  PCU  in  consultation  with  the  district \ngovernment  will  assist  in  monitoring  design  standards,  undertake  environmental  assessments, \nmanage civil work contracts, and ensure effective construction supervision and quality control. \n \n49. \nThe  villages  eligible  for  infrastructure  activities  under  the  set  criteria  (Appendix  5)  will  be \nselected by SKAA in consultation with the concerned union council.36 Implementation of settlement \ninfrastructure  improvement,  and  that  of  the  village  link  roads,  will  be  the  responsibility  of  SKAA,  in \ncooperation with the BOR, which will be responsible for the regularization of the selected villages and \nthe  issuance  of  individual  sanads.  SKAA  and  the  concerned  CBO  will  facilitate  a  participatory \napproach where the village group will (i) identify/prioritize  the  interventions;  (ii) prepare a settlement \ndevelopment  plan  and  draw  up  a  partnership  agreement  that  will  describe  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the villagers, SKAA, and the CBO; and (iii) assist in the social mobilization required \nfor  the  execution  of  the  civil  works.  SKAA  will  be  responsible  for  the  financial  and  administrative \nmanagement  of  the  subproject.  In  consultation  with  the  CBO  and  villagers,  SKAA,  working  in \naccordance  with  its  standard  procedures,  will  prepare  detailed  designs,  quantities,  and  cost \nestimates.  It  will  be  responsible  for  (i) the  execution  and  supervision  of  civil  works,  implemented \nthrough laborers and petty contractors recruited from the community; (ii) the financial management of \nthe subproject, including recruitment of the local petty contractors, hiring of laborers, and purchasing \nof  the  material;  and  (iii) together  with  the  CBO  organize  the  O&M  of  the  infrastructure  after \nconstruction.37  \n \n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n50. \nThe Project will be implemented over a 7-year period (2003\u20132009). The first year will be spent \nmainly in setting up the PCU and the PIOs, and in other preparatory tasks, including (i) preparation of \nwork and financial plans; and (ii) procurement of goods and services (consultants, NGOs, and other \nservice  contractors).  Infrastructure  development  will  start  on  the  satisfactory  completion  of  the \nfollowing  (i)  village  identification,  (ii)  social  preparation  of  village  groups,  (iii)  engineering  plans  and \ndesigns, and (iv) selection of the civil works contractors (Appendix 6). To minimize start-up delays, \nADB has approved advance action for the recruitment of consultants and lead NGOs.  \n                                                 \n35 The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency will be involved in required environmental impact assessments.  \n36 Lowest administrative level. \n37 SKAA will ensure that a government-approved testing laboratory will carry out drinking water quality monitoring. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n51. \nGoods  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured  by  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent,  or  by  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is  valued  from  $100,000  to  $500,000. \nDirect  purchase  will  be  applied  for  procurement  of  goods  and  materials  estimated  to  cost  less \nthan $100,000. Under the Project, international competitive bidding or international shopping will \nbe  employed  for  vehicle  procurement,  as  appropriate,  and  international  shopping  and  direct \npurchase for office equipment, furniture and computers for the PCU and PIOs (Appendix 10).  \n \n52. \nThe civil works to be contracted by the district government under the Project are limited to the \ndistrict link roads. These works lend themselves to local competitive bidding as the contracts will be \nsmall,  scattered  over  four  districts,  and  phased  over  the  implementation  period  and,  as  such, \nindividual contracts are unlikely to attract international bidders. The local capacity to undertake these \ncontracts is adequate and the civil works will be carried out by prequalified contractors through local \ncompetitive bidding in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. The proposed \ncontract  packaging  for  the  district  link  roads  and  draft  bidding  documents  (common  to  the  four \ndistricts) will be submitted to ADB for prior review and consideration.  The civil works for settlement \ninfrastructure improvement, as well as for the village link roads, will be carried out by SKAA and the \nconcerned  village  group.  Village  groups,  or  SKAA  on  behalf  of  the  village  groups,  will  procure \nmaterials, machinery hire, and labor directly from local sources, using procedures acceptable to ADB. \nSingle procurement packages by village groups will be limited to a maximum of $10,000 each. \n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting and Nongovernment Organization Services \n\n \n53. \nTo ensure successful implementation and enhance capacities and technical expertise of \nthe district governments, consulting services are required.  The  Project  will  provide  521  person-\nmonths  of  specialized  services  (494  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  and  27  person-\nmonths of international consultants) in long-term and short-term appointments through consulting \nfirms and individual consultants. The quality and cost-based selection method will be used. The \nPCU will recruit and manage the consulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for  the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  The  services  of  domestic  NGOs  are  required  in  community  development  activities, \nagricultural  and  household  technology  dissemination,  awareness-raising  campaigns,  and  in \ninstituting simple account-keeping systems between haris and landlords. To the extent possible, \nprequalified NGOs will be contracted on the basis of competitive bidding procedures. Where the \nnumber  of  qualified  NGOs  is  limited,  direct  selection  may  be  applied  with  the  prior  approval  of \nADB. The expertise required and outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n54. \nThe Government of Pakistan will pass on loan funds to the government of Sindh on the same \nterms  and  conditions  as  those  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  ADB.  To  expedite \ndisbursement and ensure timely execution of the Project, the LGD (PCU) will, immediately after loan \neffectiveness,  establish  a  first-generation  imprest  account  with  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan. \nPayments  will  be  made  to  and  from  this  account  for  eligible  expenditure  under  the  Project.  Five \nsecond-generation imprest accounts will be opened by the PIOs at the National Bank of Pakistan in \neach of the four districts and by SKAA. These accounts will be used to meet eligible expenditures \nunder  the  Project  incurred  by  the  four  PIOs  and  SKAA.  The  opening  of  all  six  of  these  imprest \naccounts will be subject to the appointment of qualified accounting staff and the establishment of \naccounting systems and internal control by the PCU, the four PIOs, and SKAA acceptable to ADB. \nEach imprest account will be managed by the PCU, the four PIOs, and SKAA in accordance with \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), and detailed arrangements agreed upon by \nthe Government and ADB. The initial combined total amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed 6 \nmonths of estimated expenditure and not more than 10% of the total loan amount. ADB\u2019s statement \nof expenditure procedures may be used to reimburse expenditures and liquidate imprest accounts \nfor payments below the ceiling of $100,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n55. \nThe PIOs and SKAA will provide the PCU with concise quarterly progress reports detailing the \nphysical  and  financial  progress  of  activities  against  agreed-upon  targets  and  summarizing  project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  results.  The  PCU  will  submit  the  consolidated  quarterly \nprogress  reports  and  a  comprehensive  annual  progress  report  to  the  relevant  government \ndepartments,  the  Economic  Affairs  Division,  and  ADB.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  a \nproject completion report in the standard ADB format will be prepared by the PCU and submitted to \nADB.  The  PCU,  the  PIOs,  and  SKAA  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditure  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  Accounts  will  be  established  and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Consolidated  project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  compiled  by  the  PCU  and  audited  annually  by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, audit report, and associated \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to \nwhich  they  relate.  In  line  with  ADB  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  sanctions  are \nmandatory  (i) for statements submitted  to  ADB more than 6 months past due date, when imprest \nfunds will not be reimbursed; and (ii) for statements submitted to ADB more than 12 months past due \ndate, when loan disbursement will be suspended. \n \n56. \nThe Appraisal Mission explained the  ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on \nfraud and corruption as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Project  accounts,  including  district  imprest  subaccounts,  SKAA\u2019s  subaccount,  and \nthe  PCU  imprest  account  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors;  the  loan  allocation \nprovides financing for this activity. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n57. \nDuring the initial year of project implementation, a project performance monitoring system \nwill be established in each district by the PIO in consultation with PCU, the project management \nconsultant,  and  the  lead  NGO  to  ensure  consistency.  The  output  generated  will  be  part  of  a \ncomputerized management information system established by the PCU. The initial survey, limited \nto  key  indicators  and  including  poverty  mapping,  will  serve  in  part  as  the  village  screening \nrequired to facilitate selection of project target villages and must be conducted in the initial year of \nthe Project. These impact indicators will be reassessed at midterm in a midterm survey and on \nproject  completion.  At  CBO  level,  participatory  gender-disaggregated  monitoring  and  evaluation \nwill  be  introduced  as  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  comprehensive  participatory  development  approach. \nFor periodic monitoring, key indicators used in the screening process will be incorporated in the \nregular  monitoring  system.  Special  studies  may  be  conducted  to  investigate  issues  relating  to \nproject implementation and its impacts. The midterm survey, referred to earlier will be completed \nand  a  report  thereon  prepared  prior  to  the  planned  ADB/government  of  Sindh  midterm  review \n(MTR) in the latter part of year three of project implementation. \n  \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n58. \nDuring the initial 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to (i) determine \nif all proposed implementation arrangements are appropriate and in place, (ii) assess the progress of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nvillage  and  infrastructure  screening  processes,  (iii) review the construction program for district link \nroads, (iv) review the poverty-focused and related hari-focused initiatives, (v) review the conduct and \noutcome  of  capacity-building  and  training  activities,  and  (vi) review  the  gender  strategy  and  plan. \nDuring the latter half of year three, ADB and the Government will jointly undertake a comprehensive \nMTR. The MTR will review  and evaluate (i) project scope, design, and implementation arrangements \n(in  particular,  modalities  of  fund  flows  to  districts  and  institutional  processes);  (ii) implementation \nprogress  against  agreed  indicators  in  the  annual  work  plans  based  on  the  project  framework; \n(iii) procurement  performance;  (iv) PCU  and  PIO  effectiveness;  (v) performance  of  consultants; \n(vi) the extent to which land records, including registration of tenants in field books and village forms, \nwere maintained and sanads issued; (vii) the progress of implementation of the gender strategy and \nplan;  (viii) the  effectiveness  of  the  grievance  redress  procedures  in  the  STA  in  settling  tenancy \ndisputes; and (ix) any other issue agreed upon between the PCU and ADB. At the latest of 1 month \nprior to the MTR, the PCU will, in consultation with the PIOs, submit a comprehensive report on each \nof the issues mentioned in (i) to (viii) above. The MTR will include recommendations for changes in \nproject  design  and  implementation  arrangements  as  needed,  which  will  be  considered  by  the \nGovernment, the government of Sindh, and ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nSocial Measures and Impact on Poverty \n\nEconomic analysis is based on increased agricultural productivity from the  improved rural \n59. \nlivelihoods  component  and  the  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  from  the  improved  district  link \nroads  subcomponent  (part  of  the  upgraded  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement  improvement \ncomponent). As village groups are the delivery mechanism in all components and investment in \nproject  management  support  is  to  facilitate  efficient  implementation,  costs  pertaining  to  these \ncomponents have been appropriately apportioned between project components. When analyzed \nseparately,  the  improved  rural  livelihoods  component  is  expected  to  generate  an  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.3% while the EIRR for the investment in the district link roads \nsubcomponent  is  expected  to  be  about  18.9%.  Together,  these  are  expected  to  generate  an \nEIRR of 18.0% (Appendix 11, Table A11.5). In addition, the Project will generate a wide range of \nnonquantifiable benefits (Appendix 11, paras. 8\u201311).  \n \nB. \n \n60. \nRural Society, Internal Village Organization, and Gender. Rural society in the project \narea  is  heterogeneous  and  highly  complex.  It  is  governed  by  traditional  principles  of  castes, \ntribes, religion, gender, political affiliations, and origin, which define the relationship between the \npoor and the ruling class. Stratification below the poverty line is low with the majority of the village \npopulation  being  poor  and  very  poor.  The  goths  (villages)  and  their  internal  organization  reflect \nthe  heterogeneity  of  the  population.  With  in-depth  knowledge  of  the  delicately  balanced \nrelationships,  the  distribution  of  power, behavioral restrictions, norms and traditions, the Project \ncan organize villages around common interests. To achieve this, the Project will use a strategy of \nworking  with  selected  lead  NGOs  and  their  CBO  partners.  Gender  disparities  are  marked  and \nfemale members of the target groups are more disadvantaged than the males. The movement of \nwomen living in the villages is restricted; rules of gender segregation and purdah apply depending \non  tribe  or  caste  affiliation.  Women  from  outside,  however,  can  move  freely.  The  Project  has \nprepared  a  detailed  gender  strategy  and  plan  (Appendix  7),  which  emphasizes  improving \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  services,  and  supports  the  introduction  of  labor-saving  appropriate \ntechnologies  and  the  improvement  of  women\u2019s  livestock  management skills. It provides for one \nfull-time  gender  specialist  per  district,  engaging  thematic  NGOs  on  gender  issues,  and  bridging \nthe present gap in women\u2019s access to services. \n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n61.  Minority  Groups.  The  Project  explicitly  targets  haris,  agricultural  laborers, and marginal \nowners-cum-tenants, including the minority groups belonging to this target group.38 Results from \nthe  PPTA  and  SSTA  social  and  poverty  assessments  do  not  anticipate  any  problems  at  the \nvillage  level  for  minority  groups  to  gain  access  to  project  interventions.  The  lead  NGOs  will \nensure that partner CBOs possess demonstrated experience in reaching out to minority groups. \nOnly  villages  will  be  included  where  different  castes  and  groups  live  together  harmoniously  \n(Appendix  5).  According  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People,  no  plan  for  indigenous  people \nneeds to be prepared, as all groups will equally benefit from project interventions. \n \nSharecropping  Tenancy.  The  sharecropping  system  is  an  important  element  of  the \n62. \npoverty situation prevailing in Sindh as well as a traditional and complex system, characterized by \nhighly  inequitable  access  to  and  control  over  resources,  highly  disadvantaging  haris.  Improving \nthe situation of the sharecroppers in the project area is considered the key to poverty reduction in \nthe project area. A detailed analysis of the sharecropping system is in Appendix 12.   \n \n63. \nAccess to Land, Infrastructure, Services, and Employment. Land ownership in the project \narea is highly inequitable. Road infrastructure linking villages to the main road network is inadequate. \nAccess to safe drinking water is limited. Adult literacy rates are very poor (Appendix 12, Table A12.1). \nAbout 90% of the population are engaged in agriculture and alternative employment is seasonal and \nextremely limited. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nBenefits and Impact on Poverty.  The Project will support awareness raising of basic rights, \n64. \nas well as the need for target groups to obtain NICs for them to exercise their right to vote, register as \ntenants, acquire ownership for their homesteads, or access formal credit. The implementation of the \namended  STA  will  ensure  a  more  equitable  sharing  system  and  the  registration  as  tenants  will \nprovide  security  of  tenure.  Together  with  improving  access  to  justice,  these  interventions  are \nexpected  to  decrease  the  vulnerability  of  the  target  groups.  Life  and  social  skills,  acquired  also \nthrough  the  literacy  training,  will  improve  awareness  of  social  issues, health and hygiene, literacy, \nawareness  of  rights  and  justice,  while  access  to  information  will  help  poor  people  avoid  being \ncheated, create more equitable access to social facilities, and give marginalized people, including \nwomen, a voice in community affairs. Community participation will increase the confidence of the poor \nand contribute to substantially strengthening civil society.  \n \nImproved farm technologies and livestock management will lead to productivity increases for \n65. \nthe  households,  of  which  88%  are  poor.  A  conservative  estimate  of  productivity  gains  in  crop  and \nlivestock  production,  combined  with  improvements  in  the  tenancy  arrangements  through  the \namended  STA,  result  in  20.9\u201329.3%  increases  in  net  farm  incomes.  Further  gains  will  arise from \nimproved incentives and effort (Appendix 2). In the absence of the amended STA, the increases in \nincome resulting from project investments would be limited to 11.5\u201315.8% in the four districts. Better \nhousing,  and  improved  water  and  sanitation  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  hygiene  and  health. \nTogether, all project interventions will gradually allow the target group to reduce their dependency on \nthe landlords. The poverty impact ratio has been calculated with and without the amended STA. In \nthe  first  scenario  the  impact  on  the  poor  would  be  77%,  whereas  in  the  latter  this  falls  to  53% \n(Appendix 2, Tables A2.4 and A2.5).  \n \nThe improvement of district link roads will improve access of some 38,500 households, of \n66. \nwhich at least 60% are poor. Improved access will result in reduced transport costs, time savings, \nreduced  consumer  prices,  and  improved  access  to  health  and  education  facilities.  Of  the \nquantifiable benefits from this, 45% will be to the poor (60% for passenger transport and 38% for \nfreight).  The  Project  will  improve  village  drinking  water  supply,  sanitation  and  drainage,  and \nphysical access for 750 villages with at least 60% of their population in poverty. Although benefits \n\n                                                 \n38  Of the population, 2.5% are Hindu scheduled castes (Bheel, Kolhi) and about 0.2% are Christians. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nfrom this are mainly nonquantifiable, it can be argued that the proportion of benefits accruing to \nthe poor will be at least 60%. Of the total population benefiting from various project interventions, \n60\u2013100%  are  poor.  Of  the  quantifiable  benefits  under  the  Project,  60%  will  accrue  to  the  poor \n(Supplementary Appendix E).   \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n67. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Category  B,  and  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  (Appendix  13)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment and environmental review procedures. The selection criteria under each \nproject component were established, specifying exclusion of any sites of ecological, archeological, or \nhistorical  importance.  Although  the  Project  will  cover  a  wide  geographic  area  and  involve \ninterventions in several sectors, there will be no major impacts, due largely to the small scale of the \ninvestments, and the low technology and low intensity of the construction works. The IEE finds that \nthe Project will not create any significant changes in the social, physical, or biological environment.  \n \n68. \nThe  potential  impacts  of  the  major  components  of  the  Project  are  primarily  construction \nrelated. Experience has shown that the environmental impact of rural roads projects, domestic village \nwater supply, and drainage and sanitation schemes is generally insignificant, especially when the \nwork involved is primarily rehabilitation or upgrading. Mitigation measures to address any potentially \nminor adverse impacts in road construction and rehabilitation are detailed in the IEE. The small-scale \nwater supply and drainage schemes will be selected in a similar fashion, but those in areas close to \nsensitive areas such as wetlands will require monitoring of the water table and water sources. This \nwill be built into the O&M plan for the schemes. Environmental sensitivity screening will be conducted \nfor  each  rural  infrastructure  intervention,  to  be  followed,  where  required,  by  the  preparation  of  an \nenvironmental assessment, including recommendations on mitigation measures.39 All land proposed \nfor  construction,  alignment,  and  improvement  or  rehabilitation  of  any  facilities  under  the  Project, \nincluding roads, will be screened for resettlement effects. No site will be selected that would involve \nland acquisition or land  conversion that might generate involuntary settlement effects, including loss \nof  income,  resources,  or  assets  for  the  nontitled.  All  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the \ncontract documents for civil works specifying penalties for noncompliance.  \n \nD. \n\nRisk Assessment \n\n69. \nAt  a  political  level,  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  requires  continued  political \ncommitment  to  improve  governance,  as  well  as  a  proactive  stance  by  the  Government  on \nfacilitating social change within the target population, particularly hari groups. Under the current \ndevolution initiatives, local governments are to be empowered (Appendix 1, para. 5). The risk that \nactivities  to  be  implemented  under  this  Project  will  be  selectively  screened  and  delivered  in \nresponse to political imperatives has been minimized by the adoption of comprehensive selection \ncriteria  (Appendix  5),  while  the  participation  of  NGOs  in  the  PSC  and  the  ZPCs  establishes  a \nsystem of checks and balances. The Government has also shown commitment to improving the \nstatus of haris in its readiness to reform the STA and its implementing Rules; the provincial labor \ndepartment  is  involved  in  the  implementation  of  the  National  Plan  for  the  Abolition  of  Bonded \nLabour,40 supported by the International Labor Organization (ILO).41 \n \n\n                                                 \n39  The screening activities will be carried out by the district government office for works and services for the district link \n\nroads and by SKAA for the village link roads and settlement infrastructure improvement. \n\n40  National Policy and Plan of Action for the Abolition of Bonded Labour and Rehabilitation of Freed Labourers. 2001. \n\nMinistry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis.

A high level of skill in \nproject  management,  including  planning,  coordination,  and  supervision,  is  required  given  the \ngeographic  coverage  and  diverse  range  of  activities  and  partners.  It  is  essential  that  the  key \nmanagement  staff  of  the  PCU  and  PIOs  have  the  necessary  vision,  conceptualization  abilities, \nand human resources development skills to properly direct the Project. The Government is aware \nof  these  requirements  and  the  Project  provides  the  necessary  project  management  support  in \nterms of consulting services to strengthen the skills of the key management staff. \n \nDelivery of activities through NGOs is an important platform of project design, but there is a \n71. \nrisk  that  NGOs  may  not  have  the  adequate  experience  or  capacity  to  meet  the  Project\u2019s  needs. \nDetailed  reviews  of  the  NGO  base  within  the  project  area  (Supplementary Appendix B) have been \nconducted, and coupled with the capacity-building activities included in the Project, the design of the \nProject has, to the degree possible, mitigated risks from this source. \n \n72. \nThe project implementation period of 7 years allows sufficient time for community mobilization \nand capacity building of the district government, lead NGOs, CBOs, and village groups, based on a \nparticipatory approach. The Project focuses on building up the core capacity of the PCU and PIOs in \nthe  early  stages,  with  a  gradual  acceleration  of  social  organization  and  community  mobilization \nprocesses and delivery capacity increases. The MTR and associated project performance monitoring \nsystem  provide  the  opportunity  to  make  adjustments  in  project  implementation, if required. To this \nextent, the Project incorporates flexibility in physical targets and subcomponent financial allocations, \nso that implementation can be adjusted to reflect absorptive capacities. \n \n73. \nThe risk associated with a lack of sustainability has been addressed through: (i) building up \nthe capacity of district government and CBOs in social mobilization and community strengthening; \n(ii) extending and reinforcing skills and levels in district government and CBOs; (iii) concentrating on \ncommunity mobilization at the village level and with specified village groups; and (iv) facilitating CBOs \nto register as citizen community boards, extend their outreach and level of services, and move toward \nbecoming sustainable. In terms of community infrastructure, experience with SKAA\u2014the Orangi pilot \nproject  and  rural  support  programs\u2014has  demonstrated  the  communities\u2019  willingness  to  accept \nresponsibility for O&M, resulting in sustainability of interventions.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n74. \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  LGD  have  given  the \n\n(i) \nThe PSC and ZPCs will be established within 1 month of loan effectiveness. \n(ii)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  each  PIO  will  appoint  a  full-time account \n\nofficer, a full-time project officer, and the necessary support staff. \n\n(iii)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness all tapedar and supervisory tapedar positions in \n\nthe project area will be filled. \n\n(iv)  Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the BOR will complete a new land survey in \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthe project area with its results reflected in accurate land records. \nThe  Government  will  take  all  appropriate  and  necessary  measures  to  encourage \norganizations in the project area to apply for funds from the Legal Empowerment \nFund under the Access to Justice Program; this will include orientation sessions on \nopportunities under the Legal Empowerment Fund. \nThe Government will facilitate access of civil society monitors to public documents \nof  immediate  relevance  to  the  Project,  in  particular  land  records\u2014including field \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\n(vii) \n\nbooks and village forms\u2014records on issuance of NICs, and records on issuance of \nproperty deeds (sanads). \nThe PCU will contract both the lead NGO and the thematic NGOs. Prequalification \nto  bid  for  the  lead  NGO  contract  will  be  in  accordance  with  criteria  agreed  upon \nbetween  the  LGD  and  ADB.  Invitations  to  submit  expressions  of  interest  will  be \nwidely advertised. Assessment criteria for proposals of thematic NGOs will reflect \nthe terms of reference and as agreed upon between the LGD and ADB. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Selection  of  prequalified  NGOs  will  be  on  the  basis  of  bidding  procedures,  which \nwill  include  both  technical  and  financial  criteria,  and  which  will  be  acceptable  to \nADB.  Preference  will  be  given  to  those  NGOs  originating  from  the  district  where \nactivities will be provided and which include female trainers. \nThe  villages,  district  link  roads,  and  village  link  roads  eligible  for  project \ninterventions will be selected in accordance with criteria agreed upon between the \nLGD and ADB. \nBy the end of 2002, the mandate of SKAA will be extended to rural areas. \nSKAA  will  recruit  sufficient  and  appropriate  staff  to  implement  the  settlement \ninfrastructure improvement subcomponent of the Project as well as the village link \nroads. \nThe  BOR  will  regularize  nonsanctioned  or  nonregularized  villages  prior  to  the \ncommencement  of  settlement  infrastructure  improvement  and  construction  of \nvillage link road in such villages. \n\n(x) \n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Sanads  will  be  issued  to  all  residents  of  sanctioned  and  regularized  villages  in \n\nwhich project activities take place. \n\n(xv) \n\n(xiv)   Prior  to  the  award  of  any  civil  works  contract,  all  land  proposed  for  construction, \nalignment,  improvement,  or  rehabilitation  of  any  facilities  under  the  Project, \nincluding roads, will be screened for resettlement effects. No site will be selected \nthat will involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate involuntary \nresettlement  effects,  including  loss  of  income,  resources,  or  assets  for  the \nnontitled. \nThere  will  be  a  maintenance  plan,  including  a  budget,  for  all  facilities  to  be \nconstructed,  aligned,  improved,  or  rehabilitated  under  the  Project,  prior  to  the \ncompletion  of  such  works.  For  village  link  roads  and  settlement  infrastructure \nimprovement,  such  a  maintenance  plan  will  be  included  in  the  partnership \nagreement  between  the  villagers  and  SKAA.  For  district  link  roads,  maintenance \nwill  be  the  responsibility  of  the  district  government  office  for  works  and  services \nand  the  annual  budget  allocation  will  be  drawn  from  the  road  maintenance  fund \navailable under the ADB-funded Road Sector Development Program.  \n\n(xvi)  All  efforts  will  be  undertaken  to  involve  community  members  in  labor-intensive \nworks, in which case they will be paid at least the applicable minimum wage. The \nGovernment will ensure equal pay for men and women for work of equal value as \nwell as the absence of child labor. \n\n(xvii)  The Government will ensure the timely and effective implementation of the gender \n\nstrategy and plan. \n\n(xviii)  The Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are allocated to the \n\nLGD in its annual budget and that these funds are released in a timely manner. \n\n(xix)   The design, extension, upgrading, renovation, and operations of facilities under the \nProject  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental requirements and \nguidelines. \n\n(xx)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the PCU, PIOs, lead NGOs, and SKAA will \ndevelop  criteria  for  monitoring  project  impact.  These  criteria  will  include  poverty \nmapping.  The  initial  survey  will  be  completed  within 1 year of loan effectiveness. \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\nThe impact indicators will be reassessed at the time of midterm review and at the \nend of the Project.  \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \nThe  following  conditions  will  be  met  by  the  Government  before  the  loan  becomes \n75. \neffective:  (i) the  PCU  and  the  PIOs  will  be  established,  and  all  PCU  staff  will  be  in  place;  and \n(ii) the PCU will have recruited a project management specialist. \n\n \nConditions for Disbursement \n\nC. \n \n76. \nThe  following  conditions  will  be  met  by  the  Government  before  disbursement  under  the \nspecified  project  components/subcomponents:  (i) no  funds  for  activities  to  be  implemented  by \nlead  NGOs,  or  under  the  guidance  of  those  NGOs,  will  be  disbursed  unless  the  lead  NGO  for \neach district has been selected and is functioning; (ii) funds for improved settlement will only be \ndisbursed  after  a  deh-wide  list  of  all  villages  in  the  project  area  with  a  population  of  over  50 \nhouseholds has been drafted, indicating which of those villages are sanctioned or regularized (or \nnot) and whether they are on state land or privately owned land and a time-bound action plan for \nthe  regularization  of  all  nonsanctioned  or  nonregularized  villages  will  also  be  drawn  up;  and \n(iii) before  any  funds  for  the  computerization  of  land  records  and/or  survey  equipment  will  be \ndisbursed, land registration and tenancy records will have been properly maintained for a period \nof at least four cropping seasons (2 years). \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n77. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of \nAgreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 37,885,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh \nRural  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the \nrate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMYOUNG-HO SHIN \nVice President (Operations 1) \n \n \n \n \n\n24 October 2002 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nThe rural sector underpins the economic and social structure of the economy of Pakistan. \nThe  agriculture  sector  contributes  about  25%  of  gross  domestic  product,  is  the  source  of  74%  of \nexports,1 and provides direct employment  for about 44% of the workforce. Despite the introduction \nof macroeconomic structural reforms in the latter half of the 1990s, there are major concerns about \nagricultural  productivity  and  growth,  with  sector  growth  of  about  3.7%  only  just  exceeding \npopulation growth of 2.5% annually over the past decade. The rural, nonfarm sector is also a major \ncontributor  to  the  economy,  but  performance  in  this  sector  has  been  equally  restrained.  This  has \nadversely affected the livelihoods and growth prospects for all the  68% of households that live in \nthe rural areas of the country.  \n \n2. \nWhile  economic  growth  in  the  farm  and  nonfarm  sectors  is  a  necessary  condition  for \nimproving  rural  livelihoods,  it  is  not  a  sufficient  condition2  and  nowhere  is  this  more  clearly \ndemonstrated  than  in  the  rural  areas  of  southern  Sindh.  Here,  structural  rigidities,  imbalance  in \naccess to resources, the impacts of the introduction of some new technologies,3 weak governance, \nand a lack of empowerment constrain the benefits of sector economic growth from \u201ctrickling down\u201d \nto  the  over  half  of  households  that  do  not  own  agricultural  land,  and  the  further  one  quarter  of \nhouseholds  that  own  2  hectares  (ha)  or  less  (termed  \u201cmarginal\u201d  farmers).  These  two  groups  are \nrepresented  in  all  facets  of  the  poverty  spectrum,  not  only  in  terms  of  income  poverty  but  also \nexhibiting  deprivation  in  key  quality  of  life  opportunities  (e.g.,  access  to  education,  health  care, \nnutrition, and safe water and sanitation), as well as vulnerability and powerlessness. This situation \nis exemplified in the results of poverty surveys where districts in southern Sindh are some of the \nleast developed in the province and in the country; primary enrollment rates are the lowest in the \ncountry  for  the  lowest  income  quintile;  70\u201380%  of  rural households in selected districts are poor \nand malnourished; infant mortality rates are among the highest in the country; and access to public \nservices is extremely restricted4 (using issuance of national identity cards as a proxy). \n \n3. \nThe  factors  that  constrain  the  ability  of  households  in  rural  Sindh  to  make  significant \nimprovements in their livelihoods are diverse and interdependent. They are both the limitations to \ndirectly improving household income and the compounding effects of a host of other factors. These \ninclude  the  deeply  skewed  distribution  of  power  and  resources;  an  institutional  and  political \nframework  that  exhibits  weak  governance  in  terms  of  poor  fiscal  management;  a  lack  of \ntransparency; inefficient and inadequate delivery of core public services; and a lack of egalitarian \nparticipation in, and access to, the political process. \n\n 4. \nGovernment initiatives to address some of these issues are outlined in the Interim Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  (IPRSP)  and  the  Three-Year  Poverty  Reduction  Program  2001\u201304.5  This \nincludes a program based on four core principles: (i) engendering growth, (ii) implementing broad-\nbased governance reforms, (iii) improving social sector outcomes, and (iv) reducing vulnerability to \nshocks.  Key  IPRSP  elements  are  correcting  macroeconomic  imbalances  and  stabilizing  the \neconomy,  promoting  an  investment  climate  that  facilitates  private  sector  investment,  developing \n\n                                                 \n1  Made up of exports of agricultural commodities (13%) and exports of agricultural manufactured products (61%). \n2  Pro-poor rural economic growth, which is accompanied by private capital formation, depends on a macroeconomic \nand sector policy environment where both urban-rural  and  farm -nonfarm  elements are balanced; market structures \nare efficient (competitive or contestable); there is good governance; property rights are well defined and enforceable; \nbasic institutional structures are in place and deliver effective services (including an appropriate regulatory and policy \nframework);  and  there  is  civil  and  social  order.  This  environment  needs  to  be  supported  by  a  basic,  functioning \ninfrastructure network and the availability of core public services (in education, health, and nutrition).  \n\n3   For example, mechanization. \n4   Social Policy and Development Centre. 2001.

Governance  reforms \ninvolve  increasing  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  administrative  operations  and  capacity \nthrough  devolution  of  power,  reforms  in  the  civil  service,  improving  access  to  justice,  and \nintroducing  fiscal  and  financial  transparency.  Human  development  initiatives  include  education, \nhealth,  water  supply,  sanitation,  nutrition,  population  planning,  and  the  provision  of  protection  to \nvulnerable groups in society. Specific programs are recommended in the area of social protection. \nThe  IPRSP  also  recognizes  the  significant  role that nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have \nplayed in poverty reduction and stresses the need for strengthening NGO/government partnerships \nin development. \n \nGovernance  has  emerged  as  one  of  Pakistan\u2019s  foremost  development  concerns.  On  14 \n5. \nAugust 2001,  a  new  integrated  three-tier  local  government  system  was  installed  under  a  bold \ndevolution  plan.  The  Government  is  relying  on  the  devolution  program  to  promote  competition, \nownership, and accountability in the delivery of public services, and by involving people actively in \ncommunity issues. This is a major opportunity for more people-centered, rights- and responsibility-\nbased government structures, but major risks relate to the weak technical and institutional capacity \nto  handle  the  diverse  set  of  functions,  the  reluctance  of  provincial  governments  to  devolve \nadministrative  and  financial  powers,  and  the  likelihood  of  control  by  local  elites.  Greater \nparticipation  of  people  requires  developing  a  civil  society,  able  to  take  over  responsibilities  within \nan environment that is conducive for accepting opposition and differing opinions. Major risks of the \ndevolution  plan  are  at  present  \u201cthe  lack  of  institutional  capacity  to  handle  the  diverse  set  of \nfunctions  being  handed  over,  the  reluctance  of  provincial  governments  to  fully  empower  local \ngovernment, unclear financial arrangements and the likelihood of control by the local elites, which \ncould defeat the purpose of inducing greater people\u2019s participation\u201d.6  \n  \nThis  governance  initiative,  significant  as  it  is,  will  only  generate  positive  impacts  in  the \n6. \nlivelihoods of the rural poor when accompanied by a coordinated and comprehensive program to \naddress  the  other  key  structural  and  social  constraints.  Such  a  program  will  need  to  combine \nthematic,  cross-cutting, and  sector initiatives in a complementary manner, addressing the critical \nconstraints that impinge directly on improvement of rural livelihoods. Governance issues therefore \nneed to be considered together with issues such as gender imbalance and sustainability. Pro-poor \nrural development initiatives at the sector level should look to promote technology appropriate for \nthe  poor  (both  farm  and  household);  facilitate  secure  ownership  and/or  tenancy  rights  on  land; \npromote efficient input, rural finance, and product markets; facilitate provision of basic services and \nthe  building  of  human/social  capital;  prioritize  necessary  infrastructure  investments;  promote \nimproved governance and empowerment; and encourage a nondiscriminatory policy environment. \nCapacity  development  and  training  need  to  focus  on  organizations  addressing  poverty  concerns \n(including  government,  NGOs,  and  community-based  organizations).  In  addition,  although  the \nresearch is not compelling, there is a growing body of work that supports the proposition that one \nmajor  driver \ninfrastructure  (roads, \ntelecommunications), education, agricultural research, and extension services.7 Analysis of quality \nof  life  indicators  shows  that  priority  investments  are  also  needed  in  health  and  nutrition.

In addition, access to relevant extension services or \nimproved  technologies  is  virtually  nonexistent.  Improvements  in  basic  literacy  and  numeracy  are \nthe  first  step  in  increased  empowerment,  as  is  community  mobilization.  Complementary  sector \ninvestments  are  needed  to  introduce  new  farm  and  household  technologies,  reduce  marketing \nmargins,  and  facilitate  linkages  to  institutional  microcredit  programs  targeted  at  the  rural  poor. \nImproved  all-weather  road  access,  both  between  villages  and  from  villages  to  the  district  road \nnetwork, is another complementary focus, as is the other major expressed need of the rural poor, \nnamely  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  improved  sanitation.  Finally,  targeted  interventions  are \nneeded  to  address  the  denial  of  people\u2019s  basic  rights  by  public  officials,  nonimplementation of \nprotective measures and legislation, substandard service delivery, and a lack of access to fair and \naffordable grievance-settlement mechanisms, including the courts.  \n \n8. \nThere  are  a  number  of  options  as  to  how  best  to  address  these  constraints in southern \nSindh  within  a  comprehensive  framework,  but  the  issue  is  to  recognize  that  empowerment, \nawareness  raising,  reinforcement  of  basic  rights,  improvements  in  literacy,  and  social/community \nmobilization  are  at  the  core  of  any  interventions  to  correct  the  power  imbalance  in  society. \nAbsorptive  capacity  determines  the  quantum  of  intervention  that  can  be  sustained.  Similarly, \ndelivery  and  demonstration  of  appropriate,  improved  technologies  for  farm  and  nonfarm \nhouseholds are dependent on delivery capacity constraints within the intervention modality and the \nabsorptive  capacity  of  the  target  population.  Complementary  sector  investments  are  urgently \nneeded  in  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement  improvement.  This  Project  is  designed  with  these \nissues  in  mind  so  as  to  ensure  an  appropriate  balance  between  components,  both  in  terms  of \naddressing  the  constraints  affecting  improvements  in  rural  livelihoods  in  a  comprehensive  and \nholistic manner, while acknowledging the institutional delivery and absorptive capacity constraints \nthat exist. \n\n                                                 \n8  See Taylor L., Mehrotra, S., and Delamonica, E. 1997.

It defines a tenant as a person who personally \n\ncultivates the land of another person (the landlord). This document adopts the term hari. \n\n10  For example, a survey of 136 households in six villages in Sanghar revealed that 83% of households had outstanding \n\nloans at an average of PRs14,000. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nDuring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and  the  subsequent  small-\n1. \nscale technical assistance (SSTA), socio-agroeconomic surveys were undertaken in the project \narea  and  the  findings  from  these,  along  with  information  from  secondary  sources,1 have been \nused in this analysis. \n \n2. \nThe amendments to the Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950 (STA) and Rules under the improved \ngovernance and legal support component aim to address the imbalances in the current tenancy \narrangements  and  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  target  group  farms.  The  activities  in  the \nimproved  rural  livelihoods  component  are  aimed  at  improving  farm  productivities  and  reducing \nproduction  costs,  and  the  expected  financial  impacts  of  these  interventions  on  individual  farm \nenterprises is more quantifiable.  To  a  large  extent,  the  household  financial  benefits  expected \nfrom  many  of  the  components  of  the  Project  cannot  be  readily  quantified,  particularly  impacts \nfrom investments in the improved social processes at the community level component and the \nupgraded  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement  improvement  component.  For  example,  any \nchanges  in  cropping  pattern  made  by  the  landowners  after  access  to  markets  is  improved  will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  household  incomes  of  haris,  but  have  not  been  quantified.  This \nappendix pertains to the activities planned in the improved rural livelihoods component and the \nimplementation of the amended STA. \n \nB. \n\nMethodology \n\n3. \nThe  financial  returns  and  costs  are  estimated  in  constant  year  2001/02  terms,  with \nfarmgate  prices  being  based  on  the  findings  of  the  surveys  undertaken  during  the  PPTA  and \nSSTA. \n \nCrop models have been prepared for the major crops and most minor crops. The only \n4. \nexception  is  orchards  in  that,  while  orchards  are  significant  in  the  project  area,  they  are  not \ntypical  in  the  cropping  pattern  adopted  by  the  target  group  farms.2  Given  that  recent  crop \nproductivities  and  cropping  patterns  have  been  severely  affected  by  the  shortages  in  canal \nwater  supplies  resulting  from  the  countrywide  drought,  average  crop  models  for  the  years \n1997/98  to  2000/01  have  been  developed,  which  include  years  with  dependable  and  normal \ncanal supplies as well as the shortages. Any productivity gains or changes in input usage levels \nresulting  from  project  interventions  have  been  assumed  to  be  on  the  base  levels  depicted  in \nthese average crop models rather than on the levels that would have prevailed in any individual \nyear (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \nBased  on  PPTA  and  SSTA  findings  and  secondary  sources,  livestock  activity  models \n5. \nhave  been  prepared  for  milking  buffalo,  cattle,  and  goats.  Milk,  cull  animals,  and  young  stock \nhave been assumed as the main products. In addition, it is assumed that all livestock produce is \nsold and household consumption needs are met through cash purchases. Intermediate products \nsuch as fodder, straw, and manure have also been assumed to be sold at the point of produce \nand purchased at the point of consumption. The livestock models assume that milking animals \n\n                                                 \n1  Sources  include  Sindh  Development  Statistics  2000/01;  Sindh  Agricultural  Statistics  2000/01;  relevant  1998 \n\nPopulation Census Reports; Household Integrated Economic Survey of 1998; and Sindh Goth Survey 2000. \n\n2  Large landowners typically employ labor to tend to their orchards during the nonbearing periods, and at the fruit-\n\nbearing periods contract it out.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nwill  have  a  5-year  milking  life  and  that  replacements  will  be  purchased  rather  than  reared  on-\nfarm.  \n \n6. \nFarm labor requirements distinguish between the peak demand periods of transplanting \nand  harvesting  where  any  labor  shortages  are  met  through  hired  labor,  and  the  off-peak \ndemand periods where the entire requirements are met through family labor. Since family labor \nis not paid in cash, only hired labor has been priced. \n \nC. \n\nAgricultural Benefits \n\n7. \nTo  indicate  the  financial  impacts  of  project  interventions  on  the  target  group,  financial \nfarm  models  have  been  prepared  for  average  hari  farms  in  the  project  area.  Based  on  PPTA \nand  SSTA  findings,  an  average  farm  size  of  1.92  hectares  (ha)  has  been  adopted.  While  the \naverage size of a hari farm in the four districts is quite similar, cropping patterns and hence the \nanalysis reflect separate farm models for each of the four districts. Given that the target group \nfarmers are mainly haris who do not make land use decisions, it is anticipated that the impacts \nof the Project on cropping patterns will be minimal. For the purpose of this analysis, it has been \nassumed  that  the  only  change  in  the  cropping  pattern  will  be  a  marginal  increase  in  the  area \nunder vegetables, which will be due to the promotion of homestead vegetable gardening among \nwomen.  At  full  development,  the  cropping  intensity  is  anticipated  to  grow  by  less  than  0.25% \n(from 131.0 to 131.3). \n \n8. \nWhile, in theory, there is a significant room for improvement in crops yields, conservative \nyield  increases  have  been  assumed  for  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  reflecting  the  large \nnumber of factors that impact on agricultural productivity. It has been assumed that in the cases \nof  wheat  and  rice  paddy,  more  focused  activities  such  as  village-level  improved  seed \nmultiplication and resource conservation/zero tillage cultivation3 will generate yield increases of \n10%. The yields of all other crops have been assumed to increase by 5%, except for sugarcane \nwhere  only  a  2%  yield  increase  is  anticipated  as  district  yields  are  already  higher  than  the \nprovincial  average.  In  case  of  livestock  productivities,  it  has  been  assumed  that  village-level \ntraining  in  improved  livestock  management,  training  of  village-based  livestock  workers,  and \nimproved milk and dairy product marketing, will increase milk and meat production by 10%. \n \n9. \nAny improvements in productivity or changes in cropping pattern and cropping intensities \nhave  been  assumed  to  take  place  over  a  period  of  5  years.  Productivity  improvements  have \nbeen summarized in Table A2.1, with detailed crop and livestock models, cropping patterns and \nfarm budgets being presented in Supplementary Appendix E.   \n \nD. \n\nBenefits of the Amended Sindh Tenancy Act \n\n10. \nThe  hari-landowner  relationship  was  traditionally  based  on  a  fairly  simple  sharing \narrangement,  which  was  formalized  by  the  STA  (Appendix  12).  Field  surveys  undertaken \nthrough the PPTA and SSTA show that compliance with the STA is selective depending on how \ngood  the  relationship  is  between  a  particular  landowner  and  his  haris  and  also  on  how \nadvantageous a particular STA clause is to the landowners. The Sindh High Court judgment of \nFebruary 2002 also commented on this aspect and called for revisions to the STA. During the \nSSTA,  intensive  consultations  with  the  haris,  landowners,  and  other  stakeholders  were \n\n                                                 \n3  Project Completion Report. 2000.

Interventions  through  the  improved  rural \nlivelihoods  component  lead  to  improved  productivity.  Reduced  input  costs  for  the  hari  and \nincreased  productivity  are  expected  to  result  in  significant  financial  benefits  for  haris, which \ndirectly  impact  on  their  poverty  status.  In  addition,  amended  STA  provisions  relating  to  debt \nallow  a  hari  to  seek  better  terms  with  other  landowners  to  pay  back  the  loan  instead  of \ncontinuing under adverse terms with the landowner to which he is indebted. In conjunction with \nimproved security of tenure, the ability to seek better terms from other landowners encourages \nmore investment and effort by the hari, which consequently results in higher productivity. \n  \n12. \nScenario 1 in Table A2.3 analyzes the impact of improved cost-sharing and productivity \nimprovement interventions resulting from the improved rural livelihoods component and shows \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nsubstantial increases in farm incomes for haris in all four districts. In the case of landowners, the \nimpact is anticipated to range from marginal improvement in Sanghar to marginal declines in the \nother three districts. The impact on landowners is even more marginal as the depicted change is \nonly  with  respect  to  income  from  the  hari-operated  holding  and  not  with  respect  to  the  overall \nfarm income that will also include income from self-cultivated land, orchards, and livestock. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Anticipated Impact on Net Farm Incomes (%) \n\nScenario 1:  Income Increase from Improved \nCost-Sharing and Productivity Improvement \nInterventions \n\nScenario 2:  Income Increase With \nAdditional Productivity Gains from \nImproved Effort \n\nHari \n29.2 \n29.3 \n21.0 \n20.9 \n\nHari \n34.4 \n34.6 \n26.9 \n26.2 \n\nLandowner \n3.1 \n3.2 \n6.1 \n8.7 \n\nLandowner \n-3.7 \n-3.5 \n-0.7 \n2.4 \n\nFarm Location \nThatta \nBadin \nMirpurkhas  \nSanghar \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimate. \n \n13.  While  the  literature  provides  evidence  of  improved  productivity  resulting  from  improved \nterms and security of tenure for haris, the studies and empirical models do not predict the size \nof  productivity  increases  and  hence  it  is  not  possible  to  gauge  the  full  impact  of  project \ninterventions.4 However, any productivity improvements additional to scenario 1 will benefit both \nharis  and  landowners.  Scenario  2  shows  the  impact  when,  in  addition  to  the  productivity \nincreases under scenario 1, another 5% increase on account of greater effort and investment by \ntenants  takes  place  and  as  a  result  incomes  of  haris  improve  by  26\u201335%  while  those  of \nlandowners  improve  by  3\u20139%.  For  all  districts  combined,  the  break-even  point\u2014the  point  at \nwhich  landowners  should  be  financially  indifferent  to  the  Project\u2019s  interventions  because  their \nincome is unchanged\u2014lies somewhere between the base yield increases shown in Table A2.1 \nand yield increases 5% above the base. Therefore, it may be concluded from this analysis that \nwith  only  modest  productivity  gains  assumed,  landowners  should  have  no  significant  financial \nincentive to prevent the haris from taking advantage of the Project\u2019s interventions. If higher yield \ngains  can  be  achieved,  the  incentives  for  landowners  to  support  the  haris\u2019  participation  will \nbecome increasingly positive. All further analysis, including that for the poverty impact, is based \non scenario 1.5 \n \nF. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n14. \nInterventions  under  the  improved  governance  and  legal  support  component  aim  at \nreducing  the  current  imbalances  in  the  present  tenancy  arrangements;  likely  financial  impacts \nhave  been  disaggregated  to  reflect  the  circumstances  of  specific  stakeholders  such  as \nharis/tenants, landowners, and agricultural laborers. Table A2.4 summarizes the calculations of \npoverty impact ratio (PIR), with the difference in the net present value of net economic benefits \nand net financial benefits being about PRs77.82 million. The interesting aspect is the distribution \nof the difference between the economic and financial present values of farm production costs. \nWhile relatively small (PRs1.45 million), it is quite significant in the sense that for hari farmers it \nrepresents a cost reduction of PRs22.13 million in the net present value with a cost increase of \nPRs20.66  million  for  the  landowners.  These  transfers  are  a  combination  of  implementing  the \namended STA, coupled with those interventions that have a specific focus on the target groups. \n\n                                                 \n4  Banerjee, A.V. et al. 2002. \u201cEmpowerment and Efficiency: Tenancy Reforms in West Bengal\u201d.

This, combined with a \nlow level of organization in the villages, makes efficient service delivery difficult. Spatial planning \nto  consolidate  the  population  in  a  smaller  number  of  settlements  has  not  been  undertaken. \nRecognizing that services can only be delivered to a limited number of villages, the Project will \nadapt its area coverage and the depth of intervention in an attempt to establish \u201cgrowth poles\u201d. \nThis will assure focused investments and spatial impact, in the expectation that growth poles will \nattract people from the very small and scarcely serviced settlements.  \n\nTable A5.1: District Overviews \n \nBadin  Mirpurkhas\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8,533\n\n6,726 \n\n2,435 \n\n10,728\n\nThatta \n\nOverall\n\nSanghar\n\n \nAreaa \n District Area (sq km) \n Canal-Irrigated Area (sq km) \nRural Population (1998)b \n Households ('000) \n Population ('000) \n Population Density (Number/sq km) \nGothsc of 50 Households and Above (2000)d \n Number \n Households ('000) \n Population ('000) \n Population as a Share of Overall Rural Population (%)\n35.2\na  For district area:  1998 Provincial Census Report of Sindh.

The  project  activities  contained  under  Component  1, \nImproved  Governance  and  Legal  Support,  will  be  carried  out  throughout  the  irrigated  areas  of \nthe four districts. Components 2, 3, and 43 are targeted to a subset of rural households in the \ndistricts.  It  will  therefore  be  critical  to  focus  on  those  villages  where  there  will  be  maximum \nimpact on the livelihoods of the target population. Later replication of project modalities should \nenable  the  benefits  of  pro-poor  interventions  to  be  broadened  across  a  larger  number  of \nvillages. \n  \n\n                                                 \n1   This assumes a rural population growth rate of 2.4% annually, 1998\u20132002. \n2   A deh is the smallest revenue unit within a district with a number of dehs making up the union. A deh may contain a \n\nnumber of self-contained villages, commonly referred to as goths.  \n\n3   Component 2:  Enhanced  Social  Processes  at  the  Community  Level;  Component  3:  Improved  Rural  Livelihoods; \n\nand Component 4: Upgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nThe villages eligible for the project activities described under components 2, 3, and 4 will \n3. \nbe  selected  from  an  estimated  rural  population  subset  containing  around  680,000  households \nwith  an  estimated  population  of  just  under  4  million,  or  85%  of  the  rural  population  of  the  four \ndistricts.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Selection Criteria \n\nthat  apply \n\n4. \nThe  selection  criteria  consist  of  primary  criteria  applicable  to  assure  that  project \ninterventions  under  the  three  components  reach  the  target  groups,  with  further  secondary \ncriteria \nInfrastructure  and  Settlement \nImprovement).  The  project  implementation  unit  will  be  responsible  for  organizing  the \nstratification  process  that  will  identify  and  select  the  villages  or  goths  eligible  for  intervention \nunder three of the components financed under the Project.  \n \n\nto  Component  4  (Upgraded  Rural \n\n1. \n\nPrimary Selection Criteria  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe number of households in the goth must be more than 50, and less than 200. \nIn excess of 60% of households must comprise farmers with less than 2 ha of land, \nor of households headed by haris, landless laborers, or females. \nThe villages must be \u201cnontransitory\u201d.  \nThe  villages  must  be  classed  as  \u201ctraditional\u201d  or  \u201cpluralistic\u201d  in  terms  of  their  social \nstructure.4  \nThere  must  be  relative  social  harmony  within  the  village  such  that  all  individual \nhouseholds  and  social  groups  can  fully  participate  equitably  in  communal  activities \nand decision making.   \nThe  village  must  not  be  receiving  assistance  for  any  similar  activities  from  public \nfunds,  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund,  Khushhalibank,  publicly  funded  umbrella \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), or other bilateral or multilateral agencies. \n\n2. \n\nSecondary Selection Criteria  \n\n5. \nSpatial and efficiency considerations apply for the additional criteria over and above the \nprimary criteria and are relevant for villages in Component 4. Firstly, there must be equity in the \nspatial distribution of activities implemented under this component across the \u201celigible\u201d villages \nthat  meet  both  the  primary  and  secondary  criteria. Project interventions under this component \ncannot therefore be concentrated in one sub-area of the district, but must be spread across all \nvillages  that  meet  the  primary  and  secondary  criteria.  All  villages  must  be  sanctioned  or \nregularized, as evidenced by lists from the Board of Revenue, and must be on public land. The \nBoard of Revenue will provide homestead titles (sanads) to households that do not hold title. In \naddition,  all  land  for  infrastructure  upgrading  must  be  free  of  habitation,  without  dispute  or \ncontroversy.  For  villages  of  less  than  100  households  (but  more  than  50),  the  maximum \nexpenditure  for  improved  settlement  (para.  8)  per  village  is  $8,000,  and  for  those  above  100 \nhouseholds (but below 200), the expenditure ceiling is $15,000.  \n \n6. \n \n\nFor village link roads, the secondary selection criteria are:  \n\n(i) \n\nOnly  existing  rural  access  roads/tracks  will  be  improved/upgraded  and  no  new \nalignment will be considered. \n\n                                                 \n4   Traditional  villages  consist  of  a  large  group  of  people  belonging  to  the  same  kinship  group  with the inhabitants \nrepresenting landowners of various types, together with haris and landless laborers. Pluralistic villages are similar, \nexcept that they have two or more ethnic or kinship groups.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  alignment  must  be  on  public  land  or,  where  private  land  is  involved,  this \nmust be voluntarily transferred at no cost to the Project or the Government. \nThe estimated implementation period must not exceed 6 months. \nThe unit cost per kilometer for village link road must not exceed $13,000. \nThe  village  communities  benefiting  from  the  village  link  roads  will  contractually \nagree  through  a  partnership  agreement  that  will  constitute  a  binding  agreement \nbetween the village and Sindh Katchi Abadis Authority (SKAA) (i) to contribute an \nagreed  percentage  to  the  cost  of  the  infrastructure;  (ii)  to implement, manage, \nand  supervise  the  construction  works;  and  (iii)  to  bear  the  responsibility  for  the \noperation  and  maintenance  requirements,  including  raising  the  necessary \nmaintenance funds and managing a village maintenance fund. \nPriority will be given to village link roads that connect to a district link road to be \nimproved under the Project. \n\n(vii)  A village link road must be connected either (i) to the existing main road network, \nor (ii) to a district link to be improved by the Project, or (iii) to another village itself \nlinked  to  the  main  road  network  or  a  district  link  road  to  be  improved  by  the \nProject. \n\nTo be eligible for provision of district link roads (which upgrade an existing link): \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nThe road must follow an existing road alignment on public land. \nThe road will link a cluster of three to five villages that are already interconnected \nby village link roads that are either existing and in a maintainable condition or are \neligible  to  be  improved  by  the  Project.  The  cluster  will  have  an  average  of  not \nless than 200 households. \nThe estimated implementation period for the road must not exceed 6 months. \nThe unit cost per kilometer must not exceed $42,000. \nThere  should  be  no  other  paved  road  within  5  kilometers  on  either  side  of  the \nproposed road. \nThe road must link to the existing main road. \nThe link road will not cause any direct or indirect threat to ecologically sensitive \nareas,  such  as  national  parks,  wildlife  sanctuaries,  or  wetlands  of  international \nsignificance, or to areas of high historical, archeological, or cultural value.  \n(viii)  The  road  will  have  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  at  least  12%  as \nestimated by the monitoring and evaluation officer in the project implementation \noffice and as confirmed by the monitoring and evaluation officer in the provincial \ncoordination unit. \nPriority  will  be  given  to  improvement  of  district  link  roads  linking  clusters  of \nvillages where village link roads will also be improved by the Project. \nPriority will be given to district link roads that connect to rural roads that will be \nimproved/contracted under the Road Sector Development Program financed by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n8. \nand drainage schemes, the secondary selection criteria are: \n \n\nFor settlement infrastructure improvement, such as water supply schemes, and sewage \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOnly small-scale, village-based water supply schemes, using either hand pumps, \nlocally  produced  windmills,  or  wells  will  be  considered.  The  Project  will  not \nsupport the sinking of new tubewells. \nRehabilitation/upgrading of existing water supply schemes will only take place in \nvillages  where  the  demand  specifically  originates  from  the  village  communities, \n\n \n7. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nand  where  the  villagers\u2019  willingness  and  capability  to  share  the  cost  and  take \nresponsibility for the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure have been \nconfirmed through consultation with the villagers. \nThe  villagers  benefiting  from  the  improved  infrastructure  will  contractually  agree \nthrough  a  partnership  agreement  that  will  constitute  a  binding  agreement \nbetween the village and SKAA (i) to contribute an agreed percentage to the cost \nof  the  infrastructure;  (ii)  to  implement,  manage,  and  supervise  the  construction \nworks;  and  (iii)  to  bear  the  responsibility  for  the  operation  and  maintenance \nrequirements, including raising the necessary maintenance funds and managing \na village maintenance fund. \nThe  water  source/location  for  water  supply  schemes  must  be  free  of  conflicts, \nand villagers must agree to allow access to all potential beneficiaries. \nThe water supply scheme will satisfy the minimum water requirement of 45 liters \nper capita per day with an annual growth rate of 3% per year for a design period \nof  20  years  for  the  proposed  settlement.

All legal awareness campaigns will include specific strategies for \ndisseminating information to women, given their limited mobility. \n\n?? All legal literacy programs will ensure at least 30% women's \n\nparticipation. \n\n?? Legal literacy courses will target women separately from men, and \n\nfemale nongovernment organization (NGO) staff will be made available \nto provide separate courses for women. The programs will be conducted \nin locations and times suitable to women and take account of women\u2019s \nrestricted mobility and domestic responsibilities. \n\n?? Selection criteria for lead NGOs and community-based organizations \n\n(CBOs) will include gender balance in staffing and gender awareness as \ndemonstrated in the number of women\u2019s groups organized in the past.  \n\n?? At least 30% of the total number of CBOs should be women\u2019s \n\norganizations. \n\n?? Contents of literacy courses will include topics relevant and important for \n\nwomen (evidenced in manuals).  \n\n?? The timing and location of courses will take account of women's time \npressures and other responsibilities. Age group-related needs will be \nconsidered in the course contents, organization, and timing. Self-\nlearning and peer group learning will be included in methodologies. \nCourse locations will be at the convenience of women, considering their \nrestrictions of mobility. \n\n??

Training for women in agricultural extension, improved livestock \n\n??\n\nmanagement, and appropriate farm technology will be prioritized. By the \nend of the Project, the local government will have recruited at least 30% \nmore female agricultural extension workers. \nImproved extension manuals will explicitly address women\u2019s \nresponsibilities and provide guidance for these responsibilities. \n?? Out of the 330 village-based livestock workers, 40% will be women. \n?? Appropriate household technologies as a project intervention is \n\naddressing women\u2019s needs and has the objective of improving women\u2019s \nhousehold management and reducing their workloads; 80% of the \nparticipants in the 1,950 interventions on appropriate household \ntechnologies will be women. \n\n \n \n?? Village planning and needs assessments will be done taking men\u2019s and \n\nwomen\u2019s different needs into account (separate meetings where \nneeded). \n\n?? Women will be consulted in the improvement and upgrading of the water \nand sanitation systems and will receive training in the operation and \nmaintenance of these systems. \n\n \n \n?? Four female project gender specialists will be hired by the provincial \ncoordination unit at the latest by 1 July 2003 to ensure integration of \ngender issues in all phases and activities of the Project. \n\n?? The initial survey to be undertaken at the start of the Project, and \n\nsubsequent surveys at midterm and at project completion, will be gender \ndisaggregated and include gender-relevant impact indicators acceptable \nto ADB.  \n\n?? Gender audits for curriculum materials and training for gender \n\nawareness will be an integral part of all project activities and the \nresponsibility of the district gender specialist. \n\n?? As a response to the acute lack of female field staff at the local \n\ngovernment level and below, thematic NGOs will be hired to provide \nsupport to CBOs in strengthening organization. \n\n?? One car per district has been budgeted for the gender-related \nactivities\u2014to be coordinated by the district gender specialist. \n\n?? The district gender specialists will organize gender-awareness training \nfor the local government executive district officers and district officers, \nand for involved partner agencies; training will adopt a practice-related, \nhands-on approach and focus on concrete examples from the project \narea. \n\n?? The district gender specialists will advise executive district officers and  \ndistrict officers, and CBOs on the integration of gender issues in project \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f4\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING \n\nTable A8.1: Expenditure Accounts Project Summary \n\n I.

For  example,  the  improved \ngovernance and legal support component aims to improve recognition of and compliance with, legal \nrights, and build the institutional capacities of stakeholders. Similarly, the enhanced social processes \nat  the  community  level  component  aims  to  organize  the  communities  to  benefit  from  activities  to \nimprove their livelihoods and to ensure implementation of activities in the improved governance and \nlegal  support  component.  Activities  under  the  upgraded  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement \nimprovement  component  aim  to  improve  living  conditions  by  upgrading  drinking  water  supply, \nsanitation,  drainage,  street  pavement  and  access,  and  will  result  in  benefits  that  are  largely \nunquantifiable.  \n \nActivities under the improved rural livelihoods component and the improved district link roads \n2. \nsubcomponent have more quantifiable benefits. As the development of village groups is the key to \ndelivery  of  the  services  in  all  components,  and  project  management  support  facilitates  efficient \nimplementation,  costs  pertaining  to  these  components  have  been  appropriately  apportioned \nbetween all components. \n \nB. \n\nMethodology \n\nThe  Project  has  an  implementation  period  of  7  years  and  the  economic  life  of  the \n3. \ninterventions  has  been  assumed  to  be  20  years.  The  prevailing  interbank  exchange  rate \n(PRs60.12/$1)  has  been  used  and  a  discount  rate  of  12%  adopted  for  net  present  value  (NPV) \nassessments.  A  world  price  numeraire  has  been  used.  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections \nhave  been  used  to  estimate  economic  prices  for  traded  crop  outputs  and  inputs.  Prices  for  wheat, \nrice  paddy,  and  seed  cotton  are  based  on  export  parity,  while  import parity is used for sugarcane, \nmilk,  urea  and  di-ammonium phosphate  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  To  reflect  local  under- and \nunemployment in the labor market, a shadow wage rate of 0.75 of the market wage is incorporated, \nwhile other inputs have been adjusted by a standard conversion factor of 0.90. For the purpose of \nthis analysis, the crop and livestock models adopted are described in Appendix 2.  \n \n\n1. \n\nDistrict Link Roads Models \n\n \n4. \nThe methodology employed to evaluate the district roads subcomponent closely follows that \nadopted for the recently approved Road Sector Development Program.1 The main impact has been \nassumed  to  be  savings  in  the  vehicle  operating  costs  (Table  A11.1).  Passenger  traffic  levels  are \nbased  on  the  survey  data  from  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  and  small-scale \ntechnical  assistance  and  data  used  by  the  Road  Sector  Development  Program.  Goods  traffic \nvolumes  have  been  quantified  by  estimating  village  level  production  and  consumption  levels  and \nassessing the volumes of surpluses and deficits to be transported. Benefits have been quantified by \ncomparing the weighted average costs of transportation with and without the district link roads. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Islamic \nRepublic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Road  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila.  This  sector  loan  includes  the  Sindh  Rural \nDevelopment  Project\u2019s  districts  and  presents  a  sample  assessment  for  one  of  the  roads  in  Sanghar  district.  The \nmethodology  for  the  economic  evaluation  uses  high  density  model  III  parameters  and  takes  into  account  traffic \ncongestion effects. The model predicts pavement deterioration and estimates yearly vehicle operating costs over the life \nof the investment for various maintenance and improvement strategies. The model then compares life cycle costs for \neach strategy with base costs and computes the net present value (NPV) and estimates the internal rate of return. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTable A11.1: Economic Vehicle Operating Costs on Unimproved and \nImproved Roads \n\nUnimproved \n\nVehicle Operating Costs (PRs/km) \nImproved \n\nVehicle Type \nAnimal-Drawn \nBicycle \nMotorcycle \nCar \nPickup \nBus \nTractor  Trolley/Truck \n\n8.48 \n2.12 \n2.86 \n12.40 \n24.06 \n49.82 \n54.17 \n        Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \nC. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nImproved Rural Livelihoods Benefits \n\n6.36 \n1.59 \n1.48 \n4.88 \n11.24 \n24.59 \n27.56 \n\nSavings \n2.12 \n0.53 \n1.38 \n7.53 \n12.83 \n25.23 \n26.61 \n\n5. \nIt  has  been  assumed  that  the  Project  will  facilitate  strengthening  of  3,200  village  groups \ninvolving  96,000  households.  Activities  will  be needs based and the mix will vary between groups, \nbut  for  this  analysis  it  is  assumed  that  50%  of  the  village  groups  will  opt  for  programs  involving \nimprovements  in  crop  and  livestock  production.  Given  that  the  target  groups  have  a  high \ndependence  on  agriculture,  the  assumed  coverage  is  conservative,  but  takes  into  account \nlandowner resistance to village group formation and the groups that become inactive. \n \n6. \nBesides  the  introduction  of  participatory  extension  methods  complemented  by  technical \ntraining, the Project incorporates farmer training in crop and livestock production; improved irrigation \nwater  use;  integrated  pest  management;  and  improved  village-level seed multiplication, as well as \nmilk and dairy product marketing. It is expected that adoption  rates for the technological packages \nwill  be  high;  however,  it  has  been  assumed  that,  in  aggregate,  only  40%  of  the  village  group \nmembers exposed to agricultural activities will adopt the new packages. It has been further assumed \nthat adoption rates will follow an S-curve and will build up over a period of 5 years from the time a \nparticular group has been exposed to the agricultural extension. The aggregate cropped areas with \nand  without  the  Project  are  summarized  in  Table  A11.2.  Resulting  incremental  production will be \nless than 2% of current production in the four districts, and hence the Project is not like to create any \nprice effects or marketing problems. \n \n\nTable A11.2: Changes in the Cropping Pattern \n\n \nCrops \nWheat \nSeed Cotton \nRice Paddy \nSugarcane \nKharif Fodder \nRabi Fodder \nVegetables \nPulses \nOilseeds \n\nWithout \n32,880 \n22,080 \n24,000 \n10,320 \n5,520 \n6,960 \n11,640 \n3,600 \n3,720 \n\nCropped Area (ha) \nWith \n32,880 \n22,080 \n24,000 \n10,320 \n5,520 \n6,960 \n11,880 \n3,600 \n3,720 \n\nChange % \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n2.0 \n- \n- \n\n       Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2. \n\nImproved District Link Roads Benefits \n\n7. \nBy  upgrading  200  kilometers  of  district  link  roads,  the  Project  improves  access  for  an \nestimated  38,500  households  in  200  villages,  impacting  an  estimated  current  annual  passenger \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\ntraffic of 4.64 million trips and goods traffic of 1.01 million tons.2 Passenger traffic has been assumed \nto  grow  at  5%  per  annum  and  goods  traffic  at  2%  per  annum.  Based  on  the  vehicle  traffic \ncomposition in the small-scale technical assistance sample villages and assumed vehicle operating \ncosts (Table A10.1), the cost savings on the passenger traffic and the goods traffic are estimated at \nPRs0.84 per trip and PRs10.66 per ton respectively. \n \n\n3. \n\nNonquantifiable Benefits \n\n \n8. \nThe  Project  will  generate  a  wide  range  of  nonquantifiable  benefits  under  the  improved \ngovernance  and  legal  support  component.  Implementation  of  the  Amended  Sindh  Tenancy  Act, \n1950  will  improve  lives  of  tenants  through  more  favorable  sharing  arrangements.  Some  575  field \nstaff  and  40  taluka  and  district  officers  of  the  Revenue  Administration  will  be  trained.  Proper \nmaintenance  of  records  will  enable  tenants  to  benefit  from  protection  against  eviction  under  the \nlegislation  and  exercising  their  fundamental  rights.  This  component  includes  a  rights awareness \ncampaign  through  mass  media,  which  will  benefit  beyond  the  four  districts.  Accompanied  by  legal \nadvice from 24 paralegals trained by the Project, this will enable target groups to access the legal \nsystem. \n \n9. \nThe main purpose of the village groups developed under the enhanced social processes at \nthe community level component is to act as delivery mechanism for all project services. The 3,200 \nvillage  groups  covering  some  96,000  households  will  be  provided  with  functional  and  numeric \nliteracy training. Improved literacy will enable them to keep records of their transactions, and provide \naccess  to  information  on  rights,  hygiene  and  basic  health,  nutrition,  and  basic  livelihood  skills,  as \nwell as on accessing credit. \n \nThe improved rural livelihoods component will reduce workloads and improve the quality of \n10. \nlife  through  introducing  appropriate  household  technologies  in  some  1,600  villages  and  through \nreducing water logging and salinity in a similar number of villages. It will also support and facilitate \nthe  expansion  of  income  generation  activities  that  will  have  spillover  benefits  to  the  nontarget \ngroups. \n \n11. \nThe  upgraded  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement  improvement  component  will  impact \npositively  on  450  smaller  villages  (50\u2013100  households)  and  300  larger  villages  (100\u2013200 \nhouseholds)  involving  an  estimated  78,500  households.  The  activities  mix  in  each  settlement  will \nvary  according  to  needs.  It  is  anticipated  that  these  will  include  drinking  water  supply,  sanitation, \ndrainage, street pavements, and village link roads. In addition, district link roads will result in savings \nin travel time, improved access to social services such as health and education, reduced consumer \nprices, improved market access, and reduced spoilage. \n \nD. \n\nProject Costs \n\nAll costs are in constant year 2001/02 terms. Investment costs are net of price contingencies \n12. \nand  interest  during  construction.  The  local  content  of  costs  other  than  labor  has  been  adjusted  by \nthe  standard  conversion  factor.  The  costs  of  project  management  support  have  been  apportioned \namong the other four project components according to the relative size of their investment costs. In \nthe enhancing social processes at the community level component, one third of the cost has been \napportioned to the improved rural livelihoods component while the remainder has been assigned to \nthe improved governance and legal support component and the improved settlement infrastructure \nsubcomponent (part of the upgraded rural infrastructure and settlement improvement component). \n  \n\n                                                 \n2  Based  on  an  annual  trip  rate  of  21.5  for  the  project  area  and  on  rural  consumption  patterns  reported  by  the  1988 \n\nHousehold Integrated Economic Survey. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nE. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Worth \n\n \n13. \nThe  improved  rural  livelihoods  component  generates  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) of 17.3% and an economic NPV of about PRs101.6 million ($1.7 million).

At  the  end  of  the \n1. \n1980s,  one  of  five  Pakistanis  were  poor;  today  it  is  one  in  three.1 The Planning Commission \nannounced  Pakistan\u2019s  official  poverty  line  in  July  2002.2  Estimates  agree  on  the  incidence  of \npoverty  currently  ranging  at  30\u201335%  with  poverty  being  higher  in  rural  than  urban  areas. \nPockets of severe poverty exist in southern Punjab, almost all of Balochistan, and large parts of \nSindh.  Poverty  is  also  manifested  along  gender  lines.  Women\u2019s  access  and  control  over \nproductive  resources  are  extremely  limited.  Women\u2019s  mobility  is  restricted,  and  gender \nsegregation and female seclusion are practiced. The female labor force participation rate is very \nlow, but women play a significant role in the agriculture sector.  \n \nB. \n\nRural Livelihoods and Poverty in the Project Area \n\n1. \n\nSocial Organization and Village Pattern \n\n2. \nHeterogeneity  and  Complexity  of  Rural  Society.  Rural  society  in  the  project  area  is \nheterogeneous and highly complex. The distribution of power is along the lines of caste, tribe, \nreligion,  gender,  political  affiliation,  and  origin.  It  follows  traditional  rules,  which  define  the \nrelationship between the poor and the ruling class. Stratification along poverty lines is low with \nthe  majority  of  the  village  population  poor  or  very  poor  and  consisting  of  haris,  agricultural \nlaborers, and marginal owners-cum-tenants.3 Besides sedentary groups, an unknown number of \nsemi-nomadic  groups  from  the  Thar  Desert  follow  well-established  migration  patterns  and \nrespond  to  contemporary  labor  demands  in  the  agricultural  areas  of  the four project districts. \nThey settle temporarily at the fringes of villages, on public or private land, where water, grazing \ngrounds, or work opportunities allow them to survive for limited periods of time.  \n \nVillage Pattern and Internal Organization. Single villages (goths) can be more or less \n3. \nhomogeneous  in  their  composition  with  people  belonging  to  one  or  more  castes  or  kinship \ngroups.  The  villages  are  clearly  demarcated  by  fences,  thorny  bushes,  or  walls  into  areas, \ncalled  para. Paras are internally  homogeneous and often share common ancestors. They are \nfurther subdivided into extended families, which can comprise several households. Households \nare  defined  as  groups  of  people  sharing  one  common  kitchen.  The  goth  is  an  exclusive \ngeographic  area  of  its  residents.  Its  informal  rules  govern  the  patterns  of  affiliation  and \nleadership. Depending on the caste or tribal affiliation, women from different paras may (or may \nnot) be able to visit each other. The rules of purdah and gender segregation apply to different \ndegrees. Women from outside can move freely inside the goth, while male visitors to a village \nhave only restricted access.  Despite  this  heterogeneity,  villages  can  be  organized  by  a  body \nfrom  outside  the  village  around  common  interests,  using  local  knowledge  of  the  delicately \nbalanced relationships, the distribution of power, behavioral restrictions, norms, and traditions. \nOrganizations able to assist in this process need to be from the area and understand its power \nstructures.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Country Strategy and Program Update: Pakistan.  \n2   This was put at 2,350 calories per adult/day (2,150 calories for urban adults, 2,450 calories for rural adults). On \nthe basis of the 1998/99 Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, the poverty line has been placed at PRs670 per \ncapita per month, which translates into $0.56 per capita per day based on the average exchange rate for 1998/99. \n\n3   Those with less than 2 hectares. \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n2. \n\nAccess to Land, Infrastructure, Services, and Employment \n\n4. \nAccess to land and water is the basis for wealth. Land ownership is highly inequitable. \nThe Agricultural Census of 1990 reported that 9.6% of the farm holdings are cultivating 43.1% of \nthe  total  farm  area  in  the  four  project  districts,  whereas  22.7%  of  the  farm  holdings  are \ncultivating just 5.5% of the total farm area. Roads linking villages to the main road network are \ninadequate and are little more than earth (katcha) tracks, suitable only for motorcycles, tractors, \nand  bullock  carts.  Access  to  safe  drinking  water  is  extremely  limited.  According  to  the  1998 \ncensus, only 10.5% of the rural population in the four districts have access to potable drinking \nwater.  The  vast  majority  of  the  villages  depend  on  watercourses,  wells,  canals,  lakes,  and \nponds for drinking water and household needs. The sanitation facilities are extremely poor. The \nlack  of  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation  are  the  sources  of  major  health  hazards.  The  adult \nliteracy  rates  are  abysmal,  at  10.5%  for  women  and  34.7%  for  men.  About  90%  of  the  rural \npopulation are engaged in crop production and animal husbandry as their primary occupation. \nMost  of  them  are  sharecroppers  and  agricultural  wage  laborers.  Other  job  opportunities  are \nlimited  to  few  trades  such  as  blacksmiths,  carpenters,  water  carriers,  weavers,  barbers,  and \nother services. The population with a national identity card in the four districts is between 68.5% \nin Thatta and 64.5% in Badin for males and between 42.4% in Mirpurkhas and 36.3% in Thatta \nfor females (Table A12.1). This means that access to formal credit is impossible, ownership of \nland  cannot  be  granted,  and  the  right  to  vote  cannot  be  exercised.

The tenancy system in southern Sindh is concentrated in the canal-\nirrigated areas of the four districts. It is deep-rooted and its feudal features reflect an extremely \nskewed  distribution  of  power.  Although  slowly  decreasing  in  importance,  tenancy  under \nsharecropping arrangements continues as a major type of land tenure. The tenant is the  hari\u2014\nliterally, \u201cwielder of the plough\u201d.4 Under a simple sharing system, the landlord provided the land \nto a hari and his family, and paid land revenue and water charges. The hari provided the labor, \na pair of bullocks, and covered all other costs. The output was shared equally. Contracts were \nand still are oral, with the minimum contract period being 1 year.  \n \n6. \nThe  relationship  between  the  landlord  and  the  hari  is  far  more  than  an  economic \narrangement.  It  is  a  complex  system,  with  advantages  and  disadvantages  for  both  sides,  but \nfrom a contemporary perspective it is a highly imbalanced relationship. The control over major \nresources  (land  and  water)  is  in  the  hands  of  the  landlord,  who  also  decides  on  the  crops  to \ncultivate and on the use of the family labor. The landlord may ask the hari or his family members \nfor labor without payment (begar). On the other side, the hari-landlord relationship is also one of \nrespect, with the landlord appreciating agricultural knowledge and skills and the commitment of \nthe  hari  to  his  work.  For  the  hari,  the  landlord  provides  continuity  and  stability  in  the  labor \narrangement, and credit in cash or in kind when needed. Trust and confidence have therefore \nalso  been  characteristics  of  the  relationship  (Table  A12.2).  The  system  also  provides  ample \nopportunities  for  abuse,  with  ethnic,  political,  religious,  and  gender  dimensions  increasing  this \nlikelihood.  Non-Muslim  haris,  mostly  from  the  Hindu  scheduled  castes,  are  considered \neconomically  more  disadvantaged  and  oppressed. Muslim haris with particular clan and caste \nties have stronger links and better bargaining positions with respect to landlords. \n  \n\nTable A12.2: The Landlord-Hari Relationship: \nAdvantages and Disadvantages \n\n \n\nLandlords \n\nAdvantages \n??

High dependency on \n\nlandlord \n\n \nChanges in the System. The influx of migrants, the changes in landownership through \n7. \nthe  awarding  of  large  tracts  of  land  to  nonresidents,  increased  availability  of  irrigated  land, \nintroduction  of  mechanization,  high-yield  varieties,  and  pesticides  and  fertilizers  have  further \naltered  the  system  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  hari.  It  has  been  influenced  and  changed  by \nmodern legislation with the Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950 attempting to regulate the informal tenancy \narrangements and to protect the rights of the cultivators. According to the Act the landlords are \nrequired,  for  example,  to  register  their  tenants  for  them  to  acquire  certain  tenancy  rights. \n\n                                                 \n4  The  Sindh  Tenancy  Act  uses  the  terms  hari  and  tenant  synonymously.  It  defines  a  tenant  as  a  person  who \n\npersonally cultivates the land of another person (the landlord). This document uses the term hari. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nHowever, this registration very often does not take place in Sindh. There is a trend to transform \nsharecropping into daily wage labor arrangements.  \n \n8. \nDebt and Credit Dimension.  Haris  get  into  debt  through  advances  they  receive  from \nthe  landlord  in  cash  or  kind  (peshgi)  to  meet  costs  of  cultivation  or  simply  to  cover  regular \nhousehold consumption requirements. The expectation is that the account is settled at the time \nof the harvest, but in reality the debt accumulates from one year to the next, as the share of the \nyield is not enough to survive, let alone to pay off the loans.5 If a hari wants to move, the new \nlandlord  takes  over  the  accumulated  debt.  The  landlord  keeps  the  account,  transactions  are \nrarely  transparent,  and  the  landlord  may  be  overvaluing  inputs  and  undervaluing  outputs.  But \neven  if  accounts  were  managed  more  openly,  haris\u2019  extremely  low  literacy  rate  would  inhibit \ntheir  control  over  the  entries.  According  to  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  report, \nthe sizes of their loans ranged between PRs20,000 and more than PRs100,000. Indebtedness \nis  widespread.  In  fact  in  Badin,  74%  of  the  hari  households  were  indebted  to  the  landlord,  in \nMirpurkhas the indebtedness was 100%. In Sanghar, indebtedness was reported by the small-\nscale  technical  assistance  report  at  between  PRs5,000  and  more  than  PRs30,000.  This  is \nconfirmed through another study6 in Sanghar, according to which virtually all haris in one of the \nstudy villages were indebted to the landlord. Haris are not allowed to leave the landlord unless \nthey  clear  their  accumulated  debt,  which  is  possible  only  with  a  cash  advance  from  another \nlandlord.7 This relationship of debt bondage is a politically sensitive issue. Landlords in Sindh, \ngovernment representatives, and other power holders continue to deny the existence of bonded \nlabor, using a variety of strategies. Some argue that the phenomenon is culturally deep-rooted \nand cannot be understood by outsiders. Others agree to a limited number of abuses. However, \nthe application of specific legislation against bonded labor\u2014namely the Bonded Labour System \n(Abolition) Act, 1992\u2014to agricultural labor has been questioned and is currently under review in \nthe Supreme Court of Pakistan. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social Strategy of the Project \n\nThe  project  poverty  and  social  strategy  is  summarized  in  Table  A12.3  and  the  poverty \n\n9. \ntargeting of project interventions is given in Table A12.4. \n \n\nTable A12.3: Summary Poverty and Social Strategy \n\nIssues \n\nSharecropping tenancy system prevalent in canal-\nirrigated area disadvantaging the haris: \n\n??

The IEE  assessed  likely  environmental  impacts  of  project  implementation \nand  identified  measures  needed  to  prevent  or  mitigate  any  possible  adverse  impacts.  The \nProject  is  classified  as  Environment  Category  B,  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Environmental \nAssessment  of  Project  Impacts.  Project  interventions  were  further  screened  with  reference  to \nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development \nProjects. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe Project has the goal of reducing poverty in four districts of southern Sindh through \nincreasing empowerment and improving governance and access to public services, transferring \ntechnology  for  improved  livelihoods,  and  providing  essential  infrastructure.  Its  objective  is  to \nimprove  the  social  status  and  economic  well-being  of  (i) haris  and  agriculture  laborers, \n(ii) marginal  owners-cum-tenants,  and  (iii) small  village-based  artisans.  This  objective  will  be \nachieved through (i) improved governance and legal support, (ii) enhanced social processes at \nthe  community  level,  (iii) improved  rural  livelihoods,  and  (iv) upgraded rural infrastructure and \nsettlement improvement. A detailed project description is included in the main text of the report.  \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment  \n\n3. \nGeographic  Zones.  Geographically,  the  four  districts  may  be  divided  into  two  zones: \n(i) coastal,  which  includes  the  South  of  Badin  and  Thatta  districts;  and  (ii) southern,  which \nincludes the alluvial plains of the River Indus from the east of the Kirthar mountains to the Thar \nDesert. \n \n4. \nMost  of  the  area  is  positioned  on  the  vast  alluvial  plain  laid  down  by  the  Indus  River \nsystem.  The  soils  are  immature,  they  lack  developed  weathering  characteristics,  and  have \ntextures closely related to local depositional conditions, but most of them are silty loams or silty \nclay loams. They generally possess good infiltration characteristics and medium to good water-\nholding capacities. Soil pH lies in the 7.8 to 8.3 range and organic matter content is 0.4\u20130.5%. \nThe vast network of irrigation canals brought about a major alteration in the ecology of the area, \nmainly because there was no provision for an accompanying system of drainage canals, or of \nconcrete  lining  of  the  irrigation  canals  and  distributaries  to  retard  seepage  of  water.  The \ndeleterious impact of this nonsustainable approach became apparent, the water table began to \nrise, and, gradually, the groundwater levels, which had previously been recorded at a depth of 5 \nmeters (m), rose to the root zone in many locations. Soil chemistry changed since each hectare-\nfoot of irrigation water annually added 0.40\u20130.45 tons of salts to each hectare (ha) of irrigated \nland.  Soils  became  gradually  salinized  and  lost  their  productivity.  The  climate  of  the  irrigated \narea  changed  slightly  and  became  more  humid  as  a  result  of  increased  transpiration  and \nsurface water evaporation. \n \n5. \nMitigation measures to restrict the rise of groundwater to the root zone were introduced \nthrough the Left Bank Outfall Drainage(LBOD) and the Right Bank Outfall Drainage systems in \nthe  mid-1990s.  However,  only  part  of  Mirpurkhas  district  in  the  project  area  is  expected  to \nbenefit  from  these  drainage  systems.  Moreover,  field  observations  suggest  that  while  water \ntables  have  been  lowered  within  a  1  kilometer  (km)  radius  of  each  functioning  tubewell,  there \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\nThe ecology of the coastal district of Badin is governed by its irrigation network, and the \n\nhas been virtually no reduction in the salinity of the land. The prevailing practice of inundation \nirrigation has taken away the benefits of the system by substantially lowering the productivity of \nthe land, thereby forcing its abandonment.  \n \n6. \nvirtually  flat  and  barren  coastal  reaches?the  Rann  of  Kutch?into  which  the  LBOD  system \ndrains its saline effluent. The mean height above sea  level of this region lies entirely below the \n5 m  contour.  This  is  the  main  reason  for  the  havoc  caused  by  the  May  1999  cyclone,  which \npushed the seawater far inland. Little natural vegetation remains except in bands of emergent \naquatics, shrubs, and a few trees surrounding wetland sites. Of the farm area, 17.6% consists of \nwaterlogged or salinized lands; forested land makes up a tiny 0.25% of the area. \n \nThe ecology of Mirpurkhas and the western parts of Sanghar district is governed by the \n7. \ncanal  irrigation  network  and  the  LBOD  system,  which  drains  saline  effluent  from  some  of  its \nareas. The former has been adversely impacted by an overall shortage of water. However, the \ntendency of large landholders as well as small farmers is to irrigate as much land as possible, \ndespite the inadequacy of the available water supply over the entire growing season. The LBOD \nsystem has yet to be optimized since it has lowered the water table by about 1 m in a restricted \nzone  of  a  1 km  radius  of  each  tubewell  installed  in  some  locations,  and  has  not  reduced  the \nsalinity  of  the  soil  nor  restored  its  productivity.  The  eastern  part  of  Mirpurkhas  and  Sanghar \ndistricts lies outside the canal-irrigated system and hence the project area.  \n \n8. \nEach side of the Indus floodplain is irrigated by canals emanating from the Kotri barrage. \nIn  the  absence  of  an  adequate  drainage  system,  about  16.8%  of  the  farm  area  has  become \nwaterlogged  and/or  salinized  while  the  area  under  forest  cover  has  shrunk  to  1.35%.  The \nirrigation  system  has  been  adversely  affected  by  an  overall  and  increasing  shortage  of  water; \nyet the tendency of all farmers is to irrigate more land than can be done by the limited supply \nfrom the canals.  \n \nHuman and Economic Development. The total population of the four districts is about \n9. \n4.2  million.  Income  is  generally  sourced  from  agriculture.  Villages  are  facing  shortages  of  all \nagricultural  inputs,  and  exhibit  severely  impoverished  and  degraded  environments.  Overall, \n64.8%  of  the  villages  have  a  population  of  less  than  50  households.  They  have  neither \ncommercial nor small-scale enterprises that can add value to their produce. Even the urbanized \ncommunities  with  limited  agro-industry  bear  a  rural  character  and  exhibit  a  highly  degraded \nenvironment.  \n \n \n10.  Wildlife  Populations.  Very  little  upland  wildlife  is  present  in  the  project  area  owing \nmainly to intensive habitat modification brought about by extensive cultivation and dense human \npopulation.  The  persistent  species  include  gray  francolins,  rabbits,  and  raptorial  birds.  A  small \npeacock population is still present, though in a protected status in a few locations. The recent \nexpansion in sugarcane production in the canal command area has benefited the wild boar (Sus \nscrofa)  population,  which  utilizes  the  extensive  cane  fields  for  both  food  and  shelter,  and  has \ngreatly multiplied in number. \n \nSeveral lakes and wetlands (e.g., Tando Bago, Phoosna, Charwo, and Khanjo lakes in \n11. \nBadin district and Jafri and Mahboob Shah lakes in the coastal area of Thatta district) are home \nto  significant  waterfowl  habitat.  The  natural  and  artificial  shallow  lakes  are  wintering  areas  for \nwaterfowl  populations  that  breed  in  Siberia.  Large  flocks  of  ducks,  including  marbled  and \nwhistling teals, pintail, mallard, gadwall, red-crested pochard, shoveller, and ruddy shelduck are \npresent on these water bodies from about September to March. Other common species are little \ngrebe,  grayleg  goose,  pelican,  and  black-winged  stilt.  Thatta  district  also  includes  the  Kinjhar, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nHadero, and Haleji lakes as the officially recognized wetlands of international significance under \nthe  United  Nations'  Ramsar  Convention.  It  may  be  pointed  out,  however,  that  the  bird \npopulations  over-wintering  on  the  wetlands  of  the  project  area  are  all  threatened  by  illegal \nshooting. The area along the Nara canal in Sanghar district is home to the Marsh crocodile and \nwaterfowl, especially the marble teal. \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n\nThe  appropriate  ADB  guidelines  were  selected  and  a  checklist  of  environmental \n12. \nparameters  was  used  to  identify  and  screen  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  different \nproject  components  and  to  suggest  possible  mitigation  measures.  In  the  absence  of  ADB \nguidelines  specific  to  multisector  small-scale  interventions  proposed  in  a  rural  development \nproject such as the present one and in order to comply with ADB's environmental assessment \nrequirements, the specific guidelines consulted for screening of proposed project interventions \nwere  as  follows  (i) Selected  Infrastructure  Projects:  Highways  and  Roads;  and  (ii) Selected \nInfrastructure Projects: Water Supply. \n \n\n1. \n\nUpgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement \n\n13. \nUnder this project component, it is proposed to upgrade two types of rural roads. First, \naround  750  km  of  gravel  village  link  roads  will  connect  selected  villages  either  directly  to  the \ndistrict road network or to a neighboring village itself connected to the district network. Second, \nfor  selected  clusters  of  project  villages  interconnected  by  village  link  roads,  the  Project  will \nprovide  for  some  200  km  of  bituminous  district  link  roads  that  will  connect  the  cluster  to  the \nexisting  district  road  network.  The  village  link  roads  will  have  a  raised  embankment  and  a \ncompacted  carriageway  of  suitable  material  (gravel  or  broken  bricks)  and  associated  small-\nscale structures (culverts and short-span bridges) to provide year-round access. The district link \nroads will generally be 3.1\u20133.6 m wide, with compacted gravel shoulders including side ditches, \ndrainage  structures,  and  short  bridge  spans  as  required.  In  general,  district  link  roads  will \ntypically  be  3\u20134  km  in  length,  and  village  link  roads  2\u20133  km,  and  both  will  follow  existing \nalignments,  but  with  flexible  geometric  design  standards  to  avoid  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n \n14. \nThe  types  of  road  envisaged  for  upgrading  are  of  a  small  scale  and  the  traffic  is \nexpected to be limited and localized. All roads will be located in areas that have little remaining \nnatural environment, and the selection process includes conducting an environmental sensitivity \nscreening  and  compliance  with  strict  environmental  impact  criteria.  The  potential  impacts  are \nprimarily  construction  related.  The  nature  of  the  work  will  be  entirely  rehabilitation  or \nimprovement  of  existing  alignments,  and  the  construction  periods  are  expected  to  be  short. \nAppropriate design and construction standards that will be monitored and followed by timely and \nsuitable  maintenance  will  ensure  effective  mitigation  of  potential  minor  environmental impacts. \nThe  prevalent  problem  of  surface  ponding  during  the  rainy  season  will  be  addressed  by \nensuring  adequate  cross  drainage.  The  Project  will  provide  training  to  the  communities \nresponsible for the operation and maintenance of the village link roads. \n \n15. \nthe \nprovision/upgrading  of  domestic  drinking  water  supplies  using  different  least-cost,  low  and \nrobust technology, and simple to operate and maintain tested models (e.g., shallow dugwells or \nsmall-scale tubewells connected to hand pumps; reservoir for storage, filtration and treatment of \nsurface water diverted from irrigation watercourses) Wastewater drainage systems will also be \nupgraded,  with  localized  treatment  and  disposal.  Localized  village  infrastructure  (e.g.,  village \nlanes)  will  be  improved.  These  small-scale  and  localized  interventions  will  not  cause  negative \n\nimprovement  subcomponent  will  encompass \n\nThe  settlement \n\ninfrastructure \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59 \n\nimpacts on the environment during construction or operation; on the contrary, they will improve \nthe living standards in the project area. Since water quality is problematic in the project area, the \ndrinking  water  supplies  will  need  appropriate  testing.  Communities  will  receive  awareness \ntraining  in  maintaining  minimum  standards  of  hygiene  and  sanitation  and  in  conservation  of \nscarce water supplies. \n \n16. \nDuring  construction  of  the  district  roads,  there  will  be  some  minor  and  temporary \ndisruption to the surroundings and the environment. Potential environmental issues may include \nsoil  erosion,  siltation  and  increase  in  runoff,  waste  generation  and  effluent  from  temporary \nconstruction  camps,  noise  pollution,  air  pollution  from  dust,  and  increased  traffic  congestion. \nThese  issues  will  be  minimized  through  appropriate  environmental  management  measures \nspecified  at  the  detailed  design  stage.  Some  of  the  mitigation  measures  may  include \n(i) construction  area  should  be  restricted  to  minimize  area  disturbed;  (ii) soil  erosion  control \nmethods  should  be  incorporated;  (iii) watering  of  construction  sites  to  reduce  dust  should  be \nundertaken;  (iv) waste  management  measures  should  be  introduced  at  construction  sites  and \ncamps;  (v) hazardous  materials  should  be  safely  stored;  (vi) groundwater  contact  should  be \nminimized during construction; (vii) vegetation disruption should be limited at construction sites \nand  removal  of  significant  habitat  vegetation  avoided;  and  (viii) disturbed  areas  should  be \nreturned to previous conditions or an improved state. All mitigation requirements will be included \nin the contract document for the contractor and for sensitive areas a performance bond system \nmight  be  included.  Monitoring  of  environmental  effects  of  the  construction  activities  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  project  engineer.  At  the  operation  stage,  periodic  microbiological  testing  of \ngroundwater  will  be  undertaken. In areas close to sensitive areas such as wetlands the water \ntable  and  water  sources  will  be  carefully  monitored  in  terms  of  any  changes  in  hydrology  and \nwater  quality.  Structured  and  planned  preventive  maintenance  programs  will  be  developed  for \nall facilities constructed under the Project and for existing facilities. \n \n\n2. \n\nImproved Rural Livelihoods \n\n17. \nThe objective of this component is to strengthen the performance of tenants, agricultural \nlaborers,  and  marginal  owners-cum-tenants  through  improvements  to  crop  cultivation  and  on-\nfarm water management practices, horticulture, and livestock. The proposed interventions were \nassessed in terms of their sustainability. The examination was conducted within the context of \nprevious land use regimes, which have already brought about severe losses to land productively \nover  extensive  areas  through  the  twin  processes  of  waterlogging  and  salinity.  The  agriculture \ninterventions  proposed  in  the  project  will  result  in  a  reduction  of  the  amounts  of  fertilizer  and \npesticides  discharged  into  the  environment,  and  will  have  positive  environmental  impact. \nSimilarly  improvement  in  farming  activities  will  reduce  the  degree  of  waterlogging  and  soil \nsalinity  of  the  land.  This  component  will  not  require  any  further  environmental assessment or \nmonitoring. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\n18. \nEnvironmental impact considerations are included as one of the selection criteria for the \nrural  infrastructure  subcomponent.  Moreover,  for  each  rural  infrastructure  intervention,  an \nenvironmental sensitivity screening will be conducted. Consultants and the Sindh Environmental \nProtection Agency will ensure that environmental assessments, where required, are conducted \nand  adequately  endorsed,  and  that  standards  are  upheld.  Government  approved  laboratories \nwill  be  used  to  test  the  drinking  water  and  provide  quality  monitoring  after  construction  of  the \nschemes.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the contractor under the supervision of the relevant district government office.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n19. \nThe  overriding  environmental  impact  on  the  project  area  has  been  the  extensive \nwaterlogging  and  salinization  caused  by  the  Indus  Basin  irrigation  system.  As  a  result,  the \nproject  area  has  extensive  tracts  of  land  that  is  no  longer  suitable  for  cultivation.  The  level  of \nintervention  and  expenditure  needed  to  correct  this  situation  is  clearly  beyond  the  capacity  of \nthe  Project.  But  careful  attention  to  soil  fertility  and  groundwater  conditions  in  planning  and \nimplementing particular agricultural and infrastructure interventions will be given in order to bring \nlocal  improvement  in  land  capability.  In  the  case  of  construction-related  impacts,  these  are \nlocalized  and  temporary  in  nature  and  can  be  minimized  through  careful  planning,  proper \nconstruction practices and efficient environmental monitoring. \n\n \nOverall, the Project is not expected to result in adverse environmental impacts. It is even \n20. \nlikely  to  bring  about  positive  impacts,  including  (i) improved  management  of  fertilizer  and \npesticide inputs, (ii) improved water management, and (iii) greater environmental awareness of \nthe communities. \n \nG. \n\nConclusions \n\n21. \nThe  IEE  has  shown  that  no  major  impacts  will  arise  from  the  Project  that  warrant \nexamination  by  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment.  This  is  also  in  accordance  with  the \nframework  of  Pakistan\u2019s  National  Conservation  Strategy,  which  is  the  fundamental  national \npolicy  document  on  environmental  protection  and  natural  resource  conservation.  Individual \ninterventions  are  at  small  scale,  focusing  on  individual  villages  or  clusters  of  villages.  These \ninterventions  are  not  expected  to  have  major  negative  environmental  impacts.  However,  if \nproperly  implemented,  improvements  and  strengthening  of  land  use  performance,  including \ncultivation,  livestock  rearing  and  water  use  improvements,  have  the  potential  to  improve \nenvironmental conditions within the project area.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 19 September 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "PRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$.01688 \nPRs59.225 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBOR \nCBO \nEIRR \nha \nIEE \nILO \nIPRSP \nKB \nLBOD \nLGD \nLRA \nMTR \nNGO \nNIC \nNPV \nO&M \nPCU \nPIO \nPIR \nPPTA \nPSC \nSKAA \nSRDP \nSSTA \nSTA \nZPC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBoard of Revenue \ncommunity-based organization \neconomic internal rate of return \nhectare \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Labour Organization \nInterim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \nKhushhalibank \nLeft Bank Outfall Drainage \nLocal Government Department \nLand Revenue Act \nmidterm review \nnongovernment organization \nnational identity card \nnet present value \noperation and maintenance \nprovincial coordination unit \nproject implementation office \npoverty impact ratio \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nprovincial steering committee \nSindh Katchi Abadis Authority \nSindh Rural Development Project \nsmall-scale technical assistance \nSindh Tenancy Act \nzila project committee \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \nThis  report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of:  Karin  Oswald  (Team  Leader),  Caroline \nVandenabeele, Alain Goffeau, and Eva Maria Mayerhofer.  \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "CONTENTS \n \n", " \nPage \n \niii \n \nvii \n \n1 \n \n1 \n1 \n2 \n \n4 \n4 \n5 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n9 \n \n15 \n15 \n15 \n17 \n17 \n \n18 \n18 \n20 \n20 \n \n20 \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n", "Performance Indicators and Analysis \nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n", "Objectives \nComponents and Outputs \nSpecial Features \nCost Estimates \nFinancing Plan \nImplementation Arrangements \n \n", " \n \n \nTHE PROPOSAL \n \nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA. \nB. \n \nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA. \nB. \nC. \nD. \nE.  \nF. \n \nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nEconomic Benefits \nA. \nSocial Measures and Impact on Poverty \nB. \nEnvironmental Impacts \nC. \nRisk Assessment \nD. \n \n \nASSURANCES \nA. \nB. \nC. \n \nRECOMMENDATION \n \n \n", "Specific Assurances  \nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \nConditions for Disbursement  \n \n", " \n \nLOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY \n \nMAP \n \nI. \n \nII. \n \n \n \nIII. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIV. \n \n \n \n \n \nV. \n \n \n \n \nVI. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", " \n"]}
