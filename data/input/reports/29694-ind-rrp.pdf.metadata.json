It facilitates expansion\nof  power  supplies  using  private  generating  capacity,  and\nconservation  of  water  and  electricity.  It  will  support  economic\ngrowth in the state, particularly in the industry sector. It will also\nallow  a  shift  in  state  government  expenditures  from  the  power\nsector to its other responsibilities, for example, in the education and\nhealth sectors. This combination of higher economic growth and\nshift in public expenditure will contribute to reducing poverty.\nGiven  the  present  constraints  on  the  power  sector  in  Gujarat-\npoliticized  tariff  setting  and  lack  of  a  transparent  competitive\nbusiness  environment-,  there  is  a  need  to  change  fundamental\npolicies  and  business  practices  to  improve  sector  efficiencies.\nInvestments on their own, without changes in policy, will not yield\nresults. Therefore, a mixed-modality sector development program,\nwhich  seeks  to  correct  policies  as  well  as  support  project\ninvestments, is considered the best instrument for supporting an\ninitiative for restructuring the power sector.\nClassification Economic growth\nThe Sector Development Program\nObjectives and Scope The immediate objectives of the Sector Development Program are\nto (i) establish independent tariff setting and regulation; (ii) rationalize\nthe imposition of tariffs, duties, and imposts in the sector to maintain\nequity  among  consumer  categories;  (iii) change  management\npractices and enhance efficiency in the power sector by introducing\ncompetition and commercialization; and (iv) improve conservation of\nwater  and  electricity  on  a  pilot  basis  through  improved  irrigation\nsystems.\nPolicy Framework\nand Actions (i) Enactment of a comprehensive Gujarat Electricity Industry\n(Reorganization  and  Regulation)  Bill  2000  (the  Bill)  that\n(a) enables  the  creation  of  a  statutory,  independent\nregulatory authority for licensing, tariff setting, and dispute\nresolution; (b) enables functional segregation of the Gujarat", "ii\nElectricity Board (GEB) into generation, transmission, and\ndistribution companies; (c) mandates, over a period of five\nyears, a gradual increase in the rate of recovery from each\nconsumer  category  of  at  least  67 percent  of  the  cost  to\nserve;  and  (d)  mandates  compulsory  metering  of  every\nconsumer over the next three years.\n(ii) Appointment  of  the  Gujarat  Electricity  Regulatory\nCommission (GERC);\n(iii)  Rationalization of tariffs and duties in the power sector;\n(iv)  Corporatization of the generation and transmission functions\nof GEB;\n(v) Support for energy and water conservation; and\n(vi)  Financial restructuring of the sector.\nThe Project The Project comprises four components:\nPart  A:  Transmission  lines  and  substations  associated  with  two\nprivate sector power projects and for system improvements.\nPart B: Transmission lines and substations associated with Kheda\n(Anand), Rajkot, and Mahesana distribution circles.\nPart  C:  Upgrading  and  strengthening  of  distribution  systems,\nespecially  in  Kheda  (Anand),  Rajkot,  and  Mahesana  distribution\ncircles.\nPart D: A pilot scheme for energy and water conservation through\nconversion of existing irrigation systems to drip irrigation systems in\nMahesana district.\nCost Estimates The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $310.2  million  equivalent,\ncomprising $200.0 million in foreign exchange and $110.2 million\nequivalent in local currency costs.\n($ million)\nFinancing Plan Source Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 200.0      0.0 200.0 64.5\nGEB     0.0  110.2  110.2 35.5\nTotal 200.0 110.2 310.2 100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GEB = Gujarat Electricity Board.\nSocial and\nEnvironmental", "iii\nMeasures  The project component of the Sector Development Program (the\nProject) has been classified as Category B and a summary initial\nenvironmental  examination  (SIEE)  report  has  been  prepared.\nAlthough there are minor construction stage environmental impacts,\nthe long-term operational impacts are positive for the environment.\nThe Project helps conserve scarce water and energy by removing\ntariff distortions and by supporting a pilot scheme for introducing of\nefficient irrigation techniques.\nPoverty impact assessment for the Sector Development Program\nindicates a temporary negative impact on farmers who use pumped\ngroundwater for irrigation on account of the sharp upward revision\nof electricity tariffs to agriculture consumers. This is sought to be\nmitigated through provision of technical and financial support for\nintroducing of irrigation systems that use less water. In the longer\nterm,  increase  in  tariffs  for  agricultural  consumers  will  have  a\npositive  benefit  in  leading  to  sustainable  agricultural  practices.\nOther social impacts of the Sector Development Program are either\nneutral or positive. The Sector Development Program will release\nsubstantial  funds  of  the  Government  of  Gujarat  (the  State\nGovernment), so far used to subsidize the power sector-, to support\nsocial sector programs.\nThe Program Loan\nLoan Amount\nand Terms $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources at the pool-\nbased variable lending rate applicable to ADB\u2019s US dollar loans, a 1\npercent front-end fee and applicable commitment charges, with a\nterm of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years.\nPeriod and\nTranching The period of the Program Loan is December 2000 to June 2002.

These have been\nmitigated through (i) approvals by the State Government for  the\nBill   establishing  the  regulatory  authority;  (ii)  GERC\u2019s  first  tariff\naward;  and  (iii)  changing  and  strengthening  organizational  and\nmanagement  structures  and  practices,  and  effective  follow-up\nmechanisms.", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on proposed\nassistance  to  India  for  the  Gujarat  Power  Sector  Development  Program,  that  includes\n(i) a program  loan,  and  (ii)  a  project  loan.  The  Report  also  describes  proposed  technical\nassistance for (i) development of a reorganization plan for the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB)\n(ii) consumer awareness and participation in Gujarat's power sector reforms, and (iii) support to\nthe Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC).

In 1996, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) revised its operational strategy for India\nand decided to direct a portion of its assistance to the states.  This change reflected the facts\nthat (i) a geographical focus, together with the ongoing selective sectoral focus, would enable\nADB  to  maximize  its  developmental  impact  on  the  states  concerned,  and  through  the\ndemonstrational impact of its operations, on other states; (ii) state-level economic reforms,\nwhich have been lagging behind initiatives taken by the Government of India, need support and\nincentives;  and  (iii)  the  states  have  considerable  autonomy  and  have  major  legislative,\nadministrative, and fiscal responsibilities in many economic and social sectors. Key elements of\nthe strategy include (i) reducing the states\u2019 fiscal deficits, (ii) reforming and restructuring public\nsector enterprises to improve their operating efficiencies, and (iii) supporting reforms in key\ninfrastructure sectors with a view to increasing private investment. Gujarat was the first state\nchosen for this type of holistic support and the first loan was made by ADB in December 1996.1\nThe Sector Development Program is an integral part of this assistance and is included in the\nIndia Country Assistance Plan for 2000. Preparatory to the Sector Development Program, ADB\napproved  five  supporting  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  amounting  to  $1.98  million,  for\nstudies.2 Preappraisal was conducted during 3-24 September 1997. Thereafter, there was a\nbreak in processing which was resumed in May 2000. Appraisal was conducted in four stages\nduring July through October 2000. 3\nIII.  THE SECTOR\nA.  Macroeconomic Context\n3. Gujarat is one of the most industrialized states in India and has the fourth highest per\ncapita income in the country. The state's per capita income in real terms increased from\nRs11,936  ($257)  in  FY1995  to  RS13,709  ($295)  in  FY1999,  compared  with  the  FY1999\nnational-level per capita real income of Rs11,878 ($255).4 Gujarat also has the third highest per\n                  \n1  Loan  1506-IND:  Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n18 December 1996.\n2  The studies include (i) preparation of a power system master plan, (ii) preparation of a framework for electricity\ntariffs, (iii) review of electricity legislation and regulations, (iv) financial support to Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB)\nfor formation of two independent distribution profit centers, and (v) solicitation for private sector implementation of\nthe Chhara Project.\n3  The Missions comprised S.

Rekha, Counsel, OGC.\n4 Data in real terms are in FY1994 constant prices.", "2\ncapita  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  country.5  It  has  experienced  rapid  growth  in  the\ndevelopment of its economy over the last five years, since India started liberalizing economic\ncontrols in 1991. However, this growth is now constrained by infrastructural bottlenecks, the\nprimary one being lack of electricity. GEB, which is the state\u2019s primary executing agency in the\nsector, is unable to raise resources for investments due to the recurring financial deficits- it\nhighly suffers on account of the state\u2019s policy of supplying electricity to agricultural consumers at\nextremely subsidized levels. The Government of Gujarat (the State Government) has initiated\nan ambitious policy of inviting private sector participation in the power sector, but this policy is\nencountering difficulties because the sector revenues at current levels are insufficient to service\nthe large inflow of capital that is required. The State Government is making strong efforts to\nmaintain fiscal discipline in its overall finances, but is constrained by its payables to GEB on\nelectricity subsidies to agricultural consumers which have escalated to about 20 percent of its\ntotal  revenues.  This  adversely  affects  resource  availability  for  other  important  areas  of\ninfrastructure  as  well  as  for  social  services  thus  causing  the  state  to  lag  behind  in\nsocioeconomic indicators compared with other economically advanced states in India. Thus, a\ncomprehensive restructuring of the power sector is essential to the state\u2019s overall economic and\nsocial development.\nB.  Sector Description and Recent Performance\n1.  Organization\n4. India consists of 28 states and 7 union territories with a total population of over 1 billion.\nIts power sector is the third largest in Asia, after that of the People\u2019s Republic of China and\nJapan. Installed generation capacity grew from about 2,000 megawatts (MW) in 1950 to about\n98,000 MW as of 31 March 2000, with an additional 12,000 MW of captive generation capacity.\nMore  than  77 million  electricity  consumers  and  about  86  percent  of  villages  have  been\nelectrified. However, the annual per capita consumption was only about 360 kilowatt-hours\n(kWh)  in  FY2000,  which  is  lower  than  the  consumption  levels  of  many  other  developing\ncountries.\n5. The organization of the power sector is determined by India\u2019s federal structure. The\nGovernment\u2019s Ministry of Power provides overall guidance to the sector, mainly through the\nCentral Electricity Authority, and owns the central power sector utilities such as the National\nThermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), the\nNuclear Power Corporation (NPC), and the Powergrid Corporation of India (Powergrid), and\nfinancing institutions such as the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Rural Electrification\nCorporation. State governments control the rest of the sector through 20 state electricity boards\n(SEBs) and 12 electricity departments (EDs). These SEBs and EDs provide distribution facilities\nand set retail tariffs. Power generation and transmission are split between the central power\nsector agencies and SEBs. The central agencies own and operate 32 percent of the country\u2019s\ntotal generation, while SEBs and EDs have 64 percent of the total. In addition, five private\nutilities in urban agglomerations have a share of 4 percent in power generation.\n6. As a result of India\u2019s federal structure, all major issues affecting the power sector require\nconcurrent action by the Government and state governments. Although the structure gives the\nGovernment a say in the affairs of the power sectors of the states, this shared responsibility\nlimits its ability to influence the power sector policies of state governments, especially with\nrespect to retail tariffs.\n                  \n5  Per capita consumption of 650 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per annum in FY2000 compared with the national average of\n360 kWh per annum.", "3\n2.  State Electricity Boards\n7. Prior to the reorganization of the power sectors in the states of Orissa (1996), Haryana\n(1998), Andhra Pradesh (1999), Karnataka (1999), and Uttar Pradesh (2000), the power sector\nin every major state was organized through its SEB. Even today, other than in these states,\nSEBs still control the operations of the sector. The Electricity Act of 1910 and the Electricity\n(Supply) Act of 1948 with their several amendments provide the legal basis for the sector\u2019s\nfunctioning and utilities\u2019 operation. These acts allow considerable managerial and financial\nautonomy to the SEBs, but this autonomy is often nominal as most state governments use\nSEBs to pursue noncommercial objectives, particularly to provide low-priced or free electricity to\nthe agriculture sector. Initially, this cross-subsidization was done to provide low-cost inputs for\nagriculture to stimulate food production and was very successful. However, that stage is now\nwell past but  the practice has continued largely to attract political support. State governments\nalso tend to interfere with SEBs' day-to-day operations, thus complicating the task of SEB\nmanagement. These interventions have led to the SEBs\u2019 deteriorating financial health, which\nhas become the central problem of India\u2019s power sector.\n8. Several years of negative internal cash generation has impoverished SEBs, impeded the\nconstruction of new power facilities, and restricted the funds available for maintenance and\nrehabilitation of existing assets, making it impossible to close the demand-supply gap. Chronic\npower shortages and poor-quality power supply continue to plague the economy in almost all\nparts of the country. If not remedied, the unavailability of sufficient power will be the single most\nimportant constraint to economic development in the coming years and will thwart efforts to\nattract domestic and foreign investment.\n9. A reform of the power sector at the state level is urgently needed to reduce the need for\nsubsidies and public spending on the sector. As a result of the state governments' interference\nin SEB operation and subsidies to agricultural customers, sector losses in FY1999 reached\nRs63.3 billion ($1.4 billion), but were reduced to Rs45.0 billion ($1.0 billion) by subsidies from\nstate governments. Power sector reform will significantly reduce claims on the country\u2019s fiscal\nresources and allow additional spending on other priority sectors such as health and education,\nwhich are essential for poverty reduction.\n3.  Central Power Utilities\n10. Until 1972, SEBs were almost solely responsible for power generation and transmission\nwithin their states, but were unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for electricity. To\nimprove the efficiency of generation, three central sector agencies - NTPC, NHPC and NPC-,\nwere established in 1975 to generate bulk power for sale to SEBs. In 1989, Powergrid was\nestablished as a transmission and dispatch company by amalgamating the transmission and\ndispatch  assets  of  all  central  power  sector  agencies.  In  addition  to  these  wholly  owned\ncompanies, the Government also has shares in special-purpose generating companies such as\nthe  Bhakra-Beas  Management  Board,  the  Damodar  Valley  Corporation,  the  Tehri  Power\nCorporation, the Nathpa-Jhakhri Power Corporation, the North-East Electric Power Corporation,\nand the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.\n11. The central agencies - NTPC, NHPC, and Powergrid - are seriously affected by the poor\nfinancial health of most SEBs, as was evidenced several times in the past when excessive\naccounts receivable from the SEBs seriously impaired the central agencies\u2019 financial liquidity.\nTo resolve this problem, NTPC has, in addition to restricting supply and obtaining Government", "4\nappropriation to settle debts of SEBs, resorted to taking over the generation facilities of SEBs in\nsettlement of accounts receivable.6\n4.  The Gujarat Power Sector\n12. The  power  sector  in  Gujarat  comprises  GEB,  the  Ahmedabad  Electricity  Company\n(AECO)  and  the  Surat  Electricity  Company  (SECO),  two  private  sector  generation\nand distribution licensees in the cities of Ahmedabad and Surat, respectively. Recently, about\n3,000 MW capacity of captive generation and of independent power producers (IPPs) has been\nsanctioned. The state has experienced an increase in demand for electricity of about 9 percent\nper  annum  over  the  last  five  years.  This  rate  of  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in\nthe foreseeable future since the state has been attracting a large share of the overseas and\ndomestic investments made in India following the liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991.\nThe key indicators for Gujarat\u2019s power sector are given in Appendix 1. In FY2000 the shares of\nthe various utilities in power sector operations were as given in Table 1 below.\nTable 1: Comparison of Electric Power Utilities in Gujarat in FY2000\nUtility Generation Share Distribution Share\nMW GWh % GWh %\nGEB a 4,534 23,177 53.54 29,135 85.5\nAECO 510 3,393 7.84 3,173 9.3\nSECO 0 0 0.0 1,769 5.2\nCentral Utilities 1,532 10,058 23.24 0 0\nIPPs 1,785 6,658 15.38 0 0\nTotal 8,361 43,286 100.0 34,077 100.0\nAECO = Ahmedabad Electric Company,  GWh = gigawatt-hours, GEB = Gujarat Electricity Board,\nIPP = independent power producer, SECO = Surat Electricity Company, MW = megawatts,\na    GEB owns and operates the transmission network in the state.\nC.  Constraints and Issues\n13. During FY1999, load shedding was experienced ranging between 50 MW and 1,450 MW\non 362 days of the year. Gujarat is facing an anticipated shortfall of about 7,000 MW of\ngenerating  capacity  over  the  next  decade  and  has  invited  private  sector  proposals  for\ndeveloping over 4,000 MW of capacity over the next five years. However, the actualization of\nthis investment will be constrained by the inflow of revenues into the sector and the perception\nby domestic and international investors of an efficient and impartial regulatory system. The\nState Government, therefore, wishes to amend the existing legislation and regulations with a\nview to enacting a new law that would address the concerns of the investors as well as create\na business  environment  conducive  to  improving  the  sector\u2019s  (i)  operational  efficiencies,\n(ii) financial viability, and (iii) service to its consumers. It proposes to do this through (i) greater\ncompetition  at  all  levels  of  the  sector  wherever  practicable;  (ii)  corporatization  and\ncommercialization of existing sector entities; (iii) private sector participation in the generation\nand distribution segments; (iv) viable tariffs that enable costs to be recovered and reasonable\nprofits to be made; (v) an independent regulator; and (vi) transparent, reasonable, direct, and\n                  \n6  As part of the agreement to make NTPC the Executing Agency for Loan 907-IND: Unchahar Thermal Power\nProject, for $160.0 million, approved on 29 September 1988,ADB, the Government of India, the Government of\nUttar Pradesh, and NTPC agreed to transfer the title to the 420-MW stage I to NTPC. NTPC has since taken over\nthe Talcher Thermal Power Station from Orissa SEB, and the Tanda Thermal Power Station from Uttar Pradesh\nSEB.", "5\nquantified subsidies to vulnerable sections of consumers. In 1995, GOG revised its power policy\nto incorporate these principles.\n14. Subsidized electricity tariffs for agricultural consumers represent a key issue that has to\nbe addressed in reforming sector. In line with the practice in other states in India with large\nagricultural production, the State Government has been providing the agriculture sector with\nsubsidized electricity. The rationale was that prices of agricultural outputs are controlled and that\ninexpensive inputs are required to compensate for these price controls and provide an incentive to\nincrease agricultural production, so that India can be self-sufficient in food. This argument has\ndistorted the pricing of electricity in Gujarat to such an extent that the electricity tariffs for the\nindustrial and commercial sectors are higher than the long-run marginal cost of power supply,\nwhile  the  tariff  for  about  0.5  million  agricultural  consumers,  prior  to  October  2000,  was\nRs350 ($7.50) per horsepower of load connected per year,7 which in FY2000 led to a revenue\nrealization of only Re0.15 per kWh ($0.003 per kWh).\n15. Based on the cost of new generation, each incremental kWh of agricultural consumption\nrequires a subsidy of at least Rs2.00 per kWh ($0.04 per kWh) for generation plus an additional\nRe1.00 per kWh ($0.02 per kWh) for transmission and distribution. This situation has resulted in\n(i) GEB not having resources to finance its expansion to meet unserved demand; (ii) agricultural\nconsumers  not  receiving  a  signal  that  electricity  is  a  scarce  resource  and,  accordingly,  not\nconserving it; (iii) other consumer groups, particularly industrial consumers, paying high tariffs that\nimpair their competitiveness and consequently establishing their own generation facilities, eroding\nGEB's consumer mix; and (iv) GEB being unable, without subsidies from the State Government,\nto earn a return on its investments as prescribed by law. The provision of heavily subsidized\nelectricity to agriculture consumers has boosted its share of consumption from 16.7 percent of all\nelectricity sold in the state in FY1971 to 43.0 percent in FY2000. The loss incurred by GEB on this\naccount is estimated at Rs14.0 billion ($0.3 billion) during FY2000.\n16. As a result of efforts made by the National Development Council (NDC)8, a high-level\ncommittee on power was constituted in June 1993. In its report submitted in October 1994,\nthe committee recommended (i) organizational reforms at the state level: commercialization, and\nunbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution of the SEBs; (ii) organizational reforms at\nregional and national levels to strengthen the role of the central sector agencies, freeing them\nfrom government control, allowing them to implement new projects on a joint-venture basis with\nthe  private  sector,  and  ultimately  reducing  Government's  equity  in  them  to  not  more  than\n26 percent; (iii) large-scale involvement of the private sector in generation and distribution, with\nthe sponsors selected through transparent and competitive bidding procedures; (iv) depoliticizing\nelectricity tariff setting by creating a national tariff board for regulating bulk tariffs at the national\nlevel and regional tariff boards for regulating bulk and retail tariffs for both public and private\nutilities at the state level; and (v) progressive phasing out of subsidies to agricultural consumers,\nwith a minimum tariff of not less than 50 percent of the average cost of supply to be introduced in\nthe first phase.9 These recommendations had been renewed in the meetings of NDC in October\nand December 1996 and a document titled Common Minimum National Action Plan for Power\nwas published by the Government based on the last meeting. However, not much progress has\nbeen achieved in these reform areas to date.\n                  \n7 GEB does not meter its agricultural consumers; hence, tariff is based on connected load.\n8 NDC is India's highest political body. It is chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises the Chief Ministers of all the\nstates in India.\n9 In the previous reports and conclusions of the conferences of power ministers, reference was made to a  minimum\nagricultural tariff of Rs0.50 per kWh ($0.011 per kWh). The general call for such a minimum tariff has become largely\na political issue because the figure of Rs0.50 per kWh has no logical basis other than it is higher than the current tariff.\nTo date, only seven states have increased the electricity tariff for agricultural  consumers to this level.", "6\n17. Two other major points in the sector\u2019s restructuring are (i) introducing private sector\nparticipation in the power sector, and (ii) reforming of SEBs. On account of the dualistic nature\nof the Indian power sector, all fundamental changes have to be effected through a political\nconsensus between the Government and the state governments. In 1991, the Government\neffected major amendments to the Electricity and Electricity (Supply) Acts, which enabled the\nstate governments to invite private sector investment in generation and distribution. Although\nthe response from the investor community has been very positive, the states have not been able\nto capitalize on this sentiment on account of the noncommercial environment of the sector and\nlack of a transparent and fair regulatory mechanism. For a start, with assistance from the World\nBank,  ADB,  and  other  aid  agencies,  the  state  of  Orissa  in  1995  enacted  comprehensive\nlegislation that allowed separation of Orissa SEB\u2019s generation, transmission, and distribution\nfunctions  (i.e., unbundling);  corporatization  of  the  sector  entities;  and  appointment  of  an\nindependent regulator for the sector. However, this start has not been without its share of\nproblems. Lack of competitive standards in the power sector,  an emphasis on privatization for\nits  own  sake  rather  than  for  effecting  improvements  in  quality  of  supply  and  consumer\nsatisfaction, the seeking of higher returns on investment without corresponding improvements in\nsupply,  and  improper  sequencing  have  undermined  the  gains  made  in  non-political  and\ntransparent tariff setting and private sector participation in generation and distribution.\nD.  State Government Expenditure\n18. Under the Ninth Five-Year Plan (FY1998-FY2002), the State Government plans to get\ninstalled an additional 4,300 MW of generating capacity. Of this, GEB will install only four\nthermal generating units for 460 MW, and IPPs will install about 4,000 MW of the additional\ncapacity. GEB is making the necessary investment in transmission and distribution under the\nNinth  Plan  to  evacuate  the  output  power  from  new  generation  units  and  to  transmit  and\ndistribute to customers. The investment includes 1,604 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of 400 kilovolt\n(kV) transmission lines, 5,475 cct-km of 220 kV transmission lines, 3,100 megavolt amperes\n(MVA) of transformer capacity in 400 kV substations, and 5,300 MVA transformer capacity in\n220 kV substations. In the Ninth Plan the State Government proposes to invest Rs37.0 billion\n($0.8 billion)  for  developing  of  its  power  sector.  This  allocation  represents  an  increase  of\n41 percent over the allocation for the Eighth Five-Year Plan at Rs26.25 billion and reflects the\nincreased priority on this sector in the State Government\u2019s plans. Within the sector, the plan\nreveals a strong emphasis on upgrading the transmission and distribution network with about 69\npercent of the total allocation. The phasing and allocation of the proposed outlay are presented\nin Table 2 .\nTable 2:  Power Sector Allocation in Gujarat\u2019s Ninth Plan (FY1998-FY2002)\n(Rs million)\nItem FY1998 FY1999 FY2000 FY2001 FY2002 Total Percent\n  Hydro Generation 46 53 106 95 0 299 0.9\n  Thermal Generation 2,233 3,137 1,938 2,160 1,530 10,998 29.7\n  T & D a 3,746 4,708 4,886 4,780 5,500 23,621 63.7\n  Rural Electrification 230 325 524 510 510 2,109 5.6\n  Others 6 12 9 15 20 62 0.2\nTotal 6,261 8,245 7,463 7,560 7,560 37,041 100.0\na  \nTransmission and distribution.\n19. This level of investment will be adequate to fulfill demands for electricity only if about\n4,000 MW of capacity ($4 billion of investment) is installed by the private sector during the plan\nperiod. Given the negative returns now being made by GEB in the transmission and distribution\nsegments of the business on account of the highly subsidized agricultural tariffs, revenues will", "7\nnot be sufficient to service this additional investment, irrespective of whether the distribution\nsystem is privatized or not. Thus, the key to the sustainability of operations in the sector\ninvolves changing the business environment and rationalizing tariffs.\nE.  The State Government\u2019s Objectives and Strategy\n20. The State Government aims to create a business environment that would be conducive\nto  improving  the  sector\u2019s  (i)  operating  efficiencies,  (ii)  financial  viability,  (iii) service  to  its\nconsumers, and (iv) conservation of electricity. It proposes to do this by (i) encouraging and\nfacilitating  private  sector  participation  in  power  generation  and  distribution  and  fostering  a\ntransparent  and  competitive  environment  with  equal  opportunities  for  the  public  and  private\nsectors;  (ii)  optimizing  the  operations  of  the  power  utilities;  (iii) tariffs  based  on  commercial\nprinciples that enable costs to be recovered and reasonable returns to be made on investments;\n(iv)  independent  regulation  and  tariff  setting  backed  up  by  statutory  provisions;  and\n(v) transparent, reasonable, direct and quantified subsidies to targeted sections of consumers.\nThe State Government wishes to comprehensively amend the existing legislation, regulations,\nand tariffs on the subject to bring into effect the above principles. It issued a comprehensive\npower policy document in December 1995 followed by a Letter of Intent to ADB in March 1996.\nAfter detailed discussions with ADB as part of the policy dialogue associated with the Sector\nDevelopment Program, the State Government submitted its development policy letter (Appendix\n2), which includes a policy matrix.\nF.  External Assistance to the Sector\n21. The power sector has received a major portion of India's external assistance. Of ADB\u2019s\ntotal Government-guaranteed lending to India amounting to $7.968 billion as of 31 October\n2000, seven loans for $1.505 billion (19 percent) had been approved for the power sector. The\nfirst four projects were for power generation; the three most recent have been sector loans to\nsupport improvements in the efficiency of SEBs and development of the national transmission\ngrid. In addition, ADB's private sector group (PSG) has approved three loans and investments\ntotaling  $79.8  million  for  one  captive  transmission  and  two  generation  projects  10.  Power\nsubprojects have also been considered for financing under ADB's private sector infrastructure\nfacility11  and  the  Infrastructure  Development  Finance  Company12.  ADB  also  approved\n$12.2 million for 18 TAs, mainly advisory, at both the national and state levels. The TAs have\nfocused  on  environmental  and  pollution  control  issues  related  to  power  generation,  bulk\ntransmission  tariffs,  improving  least-cost  system  planning,  tariff  studies  at  the  retail  level,\nimprovement  of  technical  and  commercial  operations,  power  sector  restructuring,  and\nestablishment of an independent regulatory authority. Previous ADB assistance to the power\nsector in India is listed in Appendix 3.\n22. The major funding source to the sector is the World Bank group. NTPC, the World\nBank's largest client worldwide, has been a major beneficiary of this assistance. The World\nBank  has  supported  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects,  including\nassistance  directed  to  SEBs.  ADB  coordinates  with  the  World  Bank  on  the  geographical\n                  \n10 Loan 7058/1036-IND: CESC Limited, for $17.8 million, approved on 4 October 1990; Loan 7082/1142-IND: CESC\nLimited II, for $32.0 million, approved on 13 December 1991; and Loan 7130/1499-IND: Balagarh Power Company\nLimited, for $15 million in equity  and a  loan of $25 million, approved on 5 December 1996.\n11 Loan 1480-IND: Private Sector Facility: Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd.; 1481-IND:\nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Facility: Industrial Finance Corp. of India Ltd.; 1482-IND: Private Sector Infrastructure\nFacility: SCICI Ltd.; for a total of $300 million, approved on 7 November 1996.\n12 Investment 7138-IND: Infrastructure Development Finance Company, for $30 million equity investment, approved\non 14 October 1997. The loan amount was subsequently reduced to $15.463 million due to greater than expected\nsubscription from the investors.", "8\ndemarcation of state-level operations, as well as to ensure overall complementarity of actions at\nboth the central and state levels. ADB and the World Bank have concurrent ongoing operations\nfor  different  projects  with  three  organizations:  PFC,  Powergrid,  and  NTPC.  Other  major\nagencies  funding  the  sector  are  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),\nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW, for the Government of Germany), the Department for\nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  (DFID),  the  Canadian  International\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), and the United States Agency for International Development\n(USAID). Although the combined assistance of all aid agencies constitutes only about 8-10\npercent of the total investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed\nas a result of this assistance. Major external assistance provided to the power sector by other\naid agencies is also listed in Appendix 3.\n23. The World Bank is supporting power sector reforms in the states of Andhra Pradesh,\nHaryana, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. In Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, power\nsector reform is viewed as part of overall reform of state finances as is being supported by ADB\nin Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.\n24. JBIC  is  supporting  the  expansion  of  public  sector  generation,  transmission,  and\ndistribution including rural electrification. It has no geographic preferences.\n25. DFID\u2019s exclusive objective in providing assistance is poverty reduction. It is financing\nstudies for restructuring the power sector in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Orissa. It has no\nplans to participate in financing hardware other than in renewable energy systems. It has\noffered to cooperate with ADB in funding studies for power sector restructuring in Madhya\nPradesh and West Bengal and to assist these states in other areas also, such as the social\ninfrastructure sectors.\n26. USAID has extensively supported and continues to support policy aspects of private\nsector participation. It has supported studies for state sector reforms through PFC, and through\nprovision of grant assistance for energy management, conservation, and training. It is working\nwith ADB and PFC for studies in Assam, Punjab, and West Bengal.\n27. CIDA has assisted Kerala in conducting extensive studies for restructuring its power\nsector, and is working with ADB in conducting such studies in Madhya Pradesh, and with the\nWorld Bank in Andhra Pradesh. ADB is following up on CIDA's work in Kerala through its policy\ndialogue and preparations for a possible loan project.\n28. The broad policy content of the Sector Development Program has been discussed with\nall the aid agencies that have supported activities associated with sector reforms at the central\nand state levels. All agencies have expressed general support for it.\nG.  ADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategy\n1.  Lessons Learned\n29. The  operations  of  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  in  the  power  sector  in  India  have\ngenerally been successful from a project point of view; i.e., the projects concerned have been\ncompleted, although with implementation delays, and performed to the desired technical levels.\nHowever, except for the ongoing loans to Powergrid13, these projects were not designed to\nchange  the  business  environment,  and  sector  performance  has  continued  to  deteriorate,\n                  \n13 Loan 1405-IND: Power Transmission (Sector) Project, for $275 million, approved on 16 November 1995 and\nLoan 1764-IND: Power Transmission Improvement (Sector) Project, for $250 million, approved on 6 October 2000.", "9\nalthough the operations of the project components, taken individually, were  satisfactory. This\nwas  primarily  on  account  of  (i) politicized  tariff  setting;  (ii) rapid  growth  of  the  demand  for\nelectricity, making conventional investment strategies unworkable; (iii) government rules and\nregulations  and  control  of  the  SEBs  that  inhibited  speedy  decision  making;  and  (iv)  the\nnoncommercial setup of the sector that did not generate the market for alternative players to\nstep in to bridge the gap between supply and demand.\n30. In the past, ADB extended assistance to discrete power projects in various states as well\nas to the central power sector agencies. Although the policy enabled ADB to support many\nprojects, it spread ADB's resources too thinly, with the result that it could not achieve its desired\ngoal of policy reforms with its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector was the\nlargest recipient of state resources in terms of both subsidies and capital investments, and it\nwas realized that macro management of the state's finances needed to be improved for the\nsuccessful turnaround of the power sector. Therefore, ADB is now assisting selected states for\npower  sector  reforms  only  in  the  context  of  a  holistic  change  in  their  macroeconomic\nmanagement.\n2.  Operational Strategy\n31. ADB\u2019s operational strategy in India is to support efforts to achieve higher sustainable\neconomic growth to promote employment and reduce poverty. Its contribution to higher growth\nfocuses  on  improving  the  supply  side  efficiency  of  the  economy,  especially  by  reducing\nbottlenecks in key infrastructure sectors. Emphasis is on improving the policy, institutional, and\nregulatory  framework  so  as  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  operations  and  to\nencourage  private  investment.  Improving  resource  mobilization  to  finance  the  necessary\ninvestments is a key component of ADB\u2019s assistance, and includes support for developing of\nfinancial and capital markets as well as for improving internal resource mobilization in the sector\nagencies and enhancing their creditworthiness. High priority is also given to assisting projects\nthat contribute to environmental improvement.\n32. ADB's strategy for India was revised in 1996 to accommodate an urgent need for a\nportion of its assistance to be provided in a systematic and comprehensive way at the sub-\nnational or state level. This need reflects the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with the\nongoing selective sector focus, enables ADB to maximize its developmental impact both in the\nstates concerned and, through the demonstrational impact of its operations, in other states as\nwell;  (ii)  state-level  economic  reforms,  which  have  been  lagging  behind  initiatives  taken\nby the Government,  need  support  and  incentives;  and  (iii)  the  states  have  considerable\nautonomy  and  have  major  legislative,  administrative,  and  fiscal  responsibilities  in  many\neconomic and social sectors. Key elements of the subnational assistance include (i) improving\nthe  states'  public  resources  management,  (ii) reforming  and  restructuring  public  sector\nenterprises to improve operating efficiencies, and (iii) supporting reforms in key infrastructure\nsectors with a view to increasing private investment. Gujarat was the first state chosen for this\ntype of holistic support and the first loan was granted by ADB in December 1996 (footnote 1).\nMadhya Pradesh was the second focal state and its loan was accorded in December 199914.\n33. Reflecting ADB\u2019s overall country strategy for India, and in recognition of the dualistic\nstructure of India's power sector, ADB's strategy for the sector, which has been pursued in\ncoordination  with  the  World  Bank,  intends  to  operate  at  two  levels.  At  the  central  level,\nassistance to central power sector companies such as Powergrid (footnote 13) and PFC15 aims\n                  \n14 Loan  1717-IND:  Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n14 December 1999.\n15 Loan No. 1161-IND: Power Efficiency (Sector) Project, for $250 million, approved on 26 March 1992. The loan\naccount was closed on 18 December 1998.", "10\nto support their commercialization and use them as agents to leverage reform in their client\nSEBs. Through Powergrid, ADB also seeks, at the central level, to implement nationwide power\nsector reforms by establishing of model cases in tariff structures, competitive pool operations,\nregulating power supply to delinquent SEBs, and investments based on commercial viability of\nprojects. At the state level, ADB is building up the reform process from the grassroots by\nconsidering  assistance  only  for  states  that  demonstrate  the  political  will  to  substantially\nrestructure and commercialize their power sectors, and by assisting them to actualize the\nreforms. Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala have been identified for ADB\u2019s holistic support.\nImprovements in the power sector will increase the fiscal space of the state governments and\nincrease  their  ability  to  allocate  more  resources  for  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic\ndevelopment.\nIV.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n34. A comprehensive program of reform-oriented studies has been initiated through ADB's\ntechnical assistance.16 As a subset of the total reforms and GEB\u2019s proposed investments in the\nNinth Plan period (FY1998-FY2002), the Sector Development Program seeks to further the key\nobjectives of the reform process that will mobilize greater resources for the power sector to enable\nrealization of, and a possible increase in, the total investment. It includes support and incentives\nfor restructuring the power sector as program assistance, and support for actual investments for\nevacuation and distribution of power from proposed private sector IPP generation projects as well\nas in hitherto relatively neglected areas of metering, energy end-use management, and system\nloss reduction.\n35. The Program has been designed to reduce GEB\u2019s operating costs, raise additional\nrevenues  and  progressively  eliminate  the  need  for  transfers  from  the  State  Government's\nbudget, allow the expansion of power supplies using private generating capacity, and improve\nthe environmental consequences of power use. It will support economic growth in the state,\nparticularly in industry, and sustain production in agriculture. It will also shift the focus of the\nState Government's expenditures from power supply to other responsibilities, for example, in the\neducation and health sectors.\n36. The Sector Development Program seeks to establish a business environment in the\npower sector that promotes efficiency and growth and to support critical investments required to\nbuild up on the new environment that is created. Since both facets of development are important\nfor  the  success  of  the  reforms,  the  sector  development  assistance  modality  has  been\nconsidered.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n37. The immediate objectives of the Sector Development Program are to provide support and\nincentives to the State Government and GEB for (i) sector reform activities such as independent\ntariff setting, tariff rationalization, and functional segregation of GEB\u2019s activities; (ii) establishing\ntransmission  systems  linked  with  IPP  generation  projects;  (iii)  modernizing  and  upgrading\ndistribution systems, especially those in the Anand, Rajkot, and Mahesana distribution circles; and\n(iv) water and electricity conservation measures. The entire exercise is geared to improve the\n                  \n16\n The studies include (i) preparation of a power system master plan; (ii) preparation of a framework for electricity\ntariffs; (iii) review of electricity legislation and regulations; (iv) financial support to GEB for formation of two\nindependent distribution profit centers; and (v) solicitation for private sector implementation of the Chhara Project.", "11\npower sector\u2019s financial and economic viability over the next five years to ensure sustained growth\nof the sector. Appendix 4 shows the Sector Development Program framework. TA for reorganizing\nof GEB, consultation with electricity consumers, and supporting the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory\nCommission (GERC) are part of the Sector Development Program.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n38. The Sector Development Program will assist Gujarat in effecting matching reforms to take\nadvantage of the 1991 policy of the Government. To make its interventions more policy oriented\nand focused, it concentrates assistance in the power sector to a state that is undertaking  reforms\nin its macro finances and has agreed to restructure its power sector and includes comprehensive,\nalbeit gradual approach to restructuring the sector allowing for development of (i) successor\norganizations to GEB, (ii) a commercial culture, (iii) consumer benefits in terms of quality of\nsupply, and (iv) rationalized tariffs and duties.\n39. ADB has been conducting policy dialogue on the Sector Development Program at three\nlevels; (i) with the Government on countrywide changes that need to be done to prepare an\nenabling framework for sector reforms; (ii) with the State Government for the policy aspects of\nthe reforms in the state; and (iii) with GEB for the Project and organizational aspects of the\nreforms. The issues discussed are as follows.\n1.  Metering\n40. At present, agriculture and socially disadvantaged consumers are provided electricity\nwithout meters on the premise that the revenues realized from them do not justify the costs\nincurred in installing meters and using them. However, this practice has led to a sharp increase in\nconsumption from such connections, a large part of which is theft of electricity. A recent survey\nindicates that over 43 percent of GEB's sales is through unmetered supply. Hence, installation of\nmeters on all consumer connections is a priority for GEB.\n2.  Private Sector Participation\n41. One of the main objectives of the Sector Development Program is to facilitate private\nsector participation in the power sector in Gujarat. It is expected that structured introduction of\nsuch participation will (i) provide additional capital, (ii) lead to greater commercialization in the\nsector,  (iii) improve  operational  efficiencies  in  the  sector,  and  (iv)  provide  a  competitive\nenvironment. Structuring this participation is essential to realize the stated benefits since it is\nimportant that the profit motive of the private sector be appropriately channeled. Gujarat has\nhad  a  long  tradition  of  private  sector  generation  and  distribution,  but  on  account  of  an\ninadequate business environment, the investments have not been as efficient as they should\nbe. Restructuring requires three key actions: (i) formulation of a least-cost expansion plan that\ndovetails investments from both the public and private sectors so as to maximize the overall\nbenefits of investments; (ii) setting up a tariff regime that does not distort costs and prices so\nthat market-driven indicators are provided to optimize operations; and (iii) creating a statutory\nregulatory authority independent of the State Government that ensures freedom of entry into the\nmarket,  transparent  procedures,  nonpartisan  resolution  of  disputes,  and  fostering  of\ncompetition.\n3.  Electricity Rates to Agricultural Consumers\n42. Currently, GEB charges a \u201cper horsepower installed\u201d flat tariff to its agricultural consumers.\nSince there is no incremental charge based on the actual withdrawal of energy, there is no", "12\nincentive  to  conserve  electricity.  A  major  social  disbenefit  caused  by  this  scheme  is  the\nindiscriminate use of groundwater by farmers in the relatively dry northern districts of the State to\ngain short-term benefits of higher cropping yields per acre through multicropping and growing\nwater-intensive cash crops instead of the traditional dry area crops grown earlier. As a result, the\nwater table has dropped from an estimated 10-12 meters (m) below ground in the 1970s to an\naverage of 150-200 m today and is dropping by an estimated 12 m every year. The water now\ncontains heavy traces of fluorides and other minerals, and it is feared that in two or three years the\nwater may turn saline, thereby severely and permanently damaging soil quality and eroding\nagricultural activity in the area. Lowering of the water table has also increased the consumption of\nelectricity per acre of irrigated land since more energy is required each year to pump up the same\nquantity of water. Hence, for the Sector Development Program, the issues of water conservation\nand  electricity  conservation  have  become  inextricably  linked.  ADB  Missions  visited  several\nvillages  in  Mahesana  district  in  north  Gujarat  and  discussed  the  issue  with  about\n300 representatives of the farming community. The Missions' impression is that (i) many farmers\nin this district would not mind paying higher rates for electricity provided the quality and reliability\nof  power  supply  improved;  and  (ii) farmers  were  hoping  that  some  agency  will  show  them\nalternative techniques of conserving water while maintaining their current levels of production and\nincome.\n43. The only option available that would fulfill the needs of water and energy conservation,\nprotect the earnings of the farmers and improve the financial viability of the sector is to help\nfarmers change the method of irrigation from the present \u201cflood irrigation\u201d technique to \u201cdrip\nirrigation\u201d which has been successfully practiced in dry areas such as Israel and southwest United\nStates.  Some  small  schemes  have  also  been  implemented  in  Rajasthan  and  Gujarat  with\nsuccess.  The  Program,  therefore,  includes  assistance  for  a  pilot  scheme  for  converting  of\nirrigation systems in Mahesana district.\n4.  Delegation of Powers to Independent Profit Centers\n44. While generation and transmission are activities that are remote from the end users of\nelectricity, distribution is closely linked to its consumers. Hence, for improvements to be effected in\nthis segment, effective delegation of administrative decision-making needs to be made to the\nmanagers that are directly responsible. To make a beginning in this respect, GEB created pilot\nindependent profit centers at Kheda (Anand circle) and Rajkot. GEB has since delegated the\nfollowing powers to the superintending engineers (managers) of the centers. The managers of\neach center will be directly accountable for its performance and the manager and the staff will be\ngiven with incentives for good performance.\n(i) Procurement. Materials to be procured by GEB headquarters (HQ) will be listed.\nExcept for items on this list, the centers will be allowed to procure all necessary\nmaterials and sufficient financial powers will be delegated for such procurement.\nFurther, there should be a maximum waiting time for supply of materials by GEB\n(HQ) to any indent from the centers, even for items on the list of materials to be\nprocured by GEB (HQ). If GEB (HQ) cannot satisfy the indent in a given time, or in\ncase of an emergency, the centers should be allowed a much higher level of\nauthority to effect their own procurement.\n(ii)  Money Transfers. Based on the approved budget for the year, the centers will\nwithhold the required funds from their collections, instead of the present practice of\nsending in all money collected to GEB (HQ) and then having their funds transferred\nback. The centers will be debited for all electricity sold to them at 66 kV and also\nfor all the materials supplied to them by GEB (HQ). If any non-remunerative work is", "13\nrequested to be undertaken by the centers, GEB (HQ) will pay for the works as\nwell  as  the  differential  revenue  loss  to  the  centers  for  the  operation  and\nmaintenance of such schemes.\n(iii)  Personnel  matters.  Once  GEB  (HQ)  selects  the  superintending  engineers\n(managers)  of  the  centers,  they  will  not  be  transferred  or  recalled  until  they\ncomplete their tenures, except in the gravest of circumstances. Important postings\nof officers and staff to the centers will be made by GEB (HQ) only after consulting\nwith the concerned manager. Further, GEB (HQ) will withdraw from the centers all\nstaff  identified  by  the  managers  as  redundant,  undesirable  or  inefficient.  The\nmanagers will be provided an annual operations and maintenance budget, which\nmay be used for salaries or equipment and facilities. Further, managers will have\nthe flexibility to reorganize their divisions to extract more efficiencies and may even\ninterchange categories of staff.\n(iv) Priority. GEB will give priority to the centers for all support as well as for reliable\npower supplies up to the extent of the electricity paid for by them.\n5.  Rationalization of Electricity Duty\n45. Prior to FY1998, there was a high level of electricity duty on GEB's supplies to high\ntension  (HT)  and  low  tension  (LT)  industrial  consumers  (averaging  about  Re0.50  per  kWh)\nwhereas captive generators paid a much lower rate (averaging at about Re0.05 per kWh after a\nduty-free concession period of 10 years). This put GEB at a disadvantage in retaining its industrial\nconsumers, especially in the wake of the liberal licensing policies for captive generation adopted\nby the state, which provides other benefits such as sales tax waivers on finished products, and\nhigher depreciation rates. Apart from cross-subsidization in the agriculture sector, the burden of\nwhich was principally borne by GEB\u2019s industrial consumers, this was the main factor leading to\nincreasing captive generation in Gujarat which has reached a sanctioned capacity of 3,100 MW\nas of  31 March 2000. The State Government has since raised the rate of duty on electricity\nproduced by captive generators to Re0.2-0.4 per kWh and has agreed to reduce electricity duty\non GEB for its sales to its industrial consumers to make competition fair to GEB.\n6.  Governance\n46. Tariff setting in the power sector in Gujarat has been heavily politicized, with agricultural\nconsumers being heavily subsidized. This has led to distortion in consumption and avoidable\nwastage of both electricity and water. There is an urgent need to depoliticize and rationalize\ntariffs if the sector's operations are to be viable. Competition in the sector has also been\nunstructured and loose as often happens in a near monopoly. Power purchase agreements\nhave largely been negotiated and there is no competition among similar business segments\nwithin the organization. Management of the sector is another key issue. GEB's management\n[other than its Member (Technical)] comprises political and bureaucratic deputies appointed by\nthe State Government. Transfers are frequent and there is little attempt at taking long-term\nperspectives on organizational development and strategies. The solution to these governance-\nrelated issues is to (i) reorganize the sector along functional lines; (ii) appoint an independent\nregulatory commission to set tariffs and structure competition in the sector; and (iii) gradually\nreplace appointees of the State Government on the boards of management of the sector\ncompanies with experts. As a consequence of this policy dialogue, the State Government\n(i) established GERC in 1998 under the Central Acts, (ii) agreed to restructure the sector\ngenerally along functional lines either, and (iii) agreed to progressively professionalize the\nmanagements of sector entities.", "14\nD.  The Investment Project\n1.  Project Description\n47. The investment project has four components (details are in Appendix 5):\n(i) Part A. Transmission lines and substations linked with IPP power projects\nand for system improvement.\n(ii) Part B. Transmission lines and substations associated with Anand, Rajkot\nand Mahesana distribution circles.\n(iii) Part C. Upgrading and strengthening of distribution systems especially in\nAnand, Rajkot, and Mahesana distribution circles.\n(iv) Part D. A pilot scheme for energy and water conservation by converting\nexisting flood irrigation systems to drip irrigation systems in Mahesana\ndistrict.\n2.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n48. The summary cost estimates of the Project are in Table 3 (details are in Appendix 6).\nTable 3: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Exchange Local Currency Total Cost\nProject Components\nPart A  72.9 37.8 110.7\nPart B  20.0 13.5 33.5\nPart C   56.9 25.1 82.0\nPart D     7.8  2.6 10.4\nSubtotal Base Cost (Oct 2000) 157.6 79.0 236.6\nContingencies\nPhysical a   15.8 7.9 23.7\nPrice b     9.1 8.0 17.1\nSubtotal   24.9 15.9 40.8\nInterest During Construction   17.5 15.3 32.8\nTotal Project Cost 200.0 110.2 310.2\na \n  Computed at 10 percent of base cost.\nb\n   Computed on the basis of 2.4 percent foreign currency inflation and 6.5 percent local currency inflation.\n49.

Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n50. The Sector Development Program has been classified as category B and a summary of\nthe initial environmental examination (SIEE) report is given in Appendix 7. Of the various project\ncomponents, minor land acquisition and tree cutting are required only for transmission lines and\nsubstations. The Project has no long-term negative environmental impacts.\n51. During Project implementation, GEB will submit to ADB an annual report consisting of\n(i) monitoring results; and (ii) copies of permits, licenses, and clearances that may be issued by\nthe Gujarat State Pollution Control Board and other state and national agencies responsible for\nenforcing of environmental safety regulation and standards. If any project component is cited for\nviolating laws or standards, the report will include a certification from the relevant agency that the\ndefect has been corrected or that a time-bound action plan for its correction has been accepted.\n52. No  significant  rehabilitation  or  resettlement  is  required  for  the  Project.  Specific  Land\nAcquisition and Resettlement Plans (LARPs) to be applied by GEB (or its successor entities) to\ncompensate those affected by the Project will be drawn up for each component during project\nexecution since they can be determined only at the time of actual construction.\n2.  Social Dimensions\n53. The Sector Development Program is designed to promote economic growth by increasing\nelectricity supply in Gujarat, including the rural areas. It will provide a reliable and quality power\nsupply, thereby improving industrialization. As a result of faster economic growth due to the\ngrowth  of  industry  and  commerce,  employment  opportunities  are  expected  to  expand,  thus\ncontributing to poverty reduction. Reliable electricity supply will also enhance education, health,\nand other social infrastructure facilities directly and indirectly. Moreover, since the funds currently\nused to subsidize the power sector will be available for social sector users, the poor will directly be\nbenefited. Small residential consumers will not be affected since the tariff system incorporates has\na lifetime rate of Rs2.70 per kWh for the first 50 kWh of consumption.\n54. During the preparation of the Sector Development Program, GERC held consultations\nwith the major consumer groups and representatives, including farmers, household heads, and\nindustrialists. While their views on the tariff structure vary, inefficiency was found to be a\ncommon concern. Transparency in electricity consumption and cross-subsidy provision was a\nmajor concern of industrial and household consumers. There was a strong demand for a\nplatform to continue the dialogue with GERC/GEB, and the need for educating consumers and\ntheir raising awareness was suggested. In addition to informing the consumer groups of reform", "16\nactions and their implications, and seeking feedback from them, consumer education should\ninclude energy conservation and environmental concern.\n55. Among the farmers\u2019 groups, water availability is the major concern. It was reported that\nthe water table in a village has been dropping an average of 4.5 to 6 m every year and the water\ntable is now 150-200 m below the ground compared with 60-75 m a decade ago. Farmers are\naware of water scarcity and the need for conservation; however, the current per horsepower\ninstalled  flat  tariff  gives  them  little  incentive  to  conserve  water.  In  fact,  it  drives  them  to\nindiscriminate  use  of  groundwater.  This  causes  a  vicious  cycle  of  water  wastage  and\ndegradation. Sole dependence on the tubewell makes it difficult for farmers to diversify their\nfarming. Therefore, the proposed pilot project on drip irrigation will have a positive outcome in\nterms of efficient water use and shift of cultivation to high-value crops.\n56. A poverty impact assessment is given in Appendix 8. Tariff increase on agricultural\nconsumers may result in a short-term negative impact. However, the impact on the small and\nmarginal farmers may not be serious, since at present these farmers, who do not own tube\nwells, buy water from large farmers at a high rate. The richer farmers tend to control water\nsupply in rural areas, and the small and marginal farmers do not necessarily benefit from the\ncurrent subsidies. Rationalizing the tariff structure will increase efficiency, and will give end\nusers water  equitable access to water.  Overall, the Sector Development Program will have a\nbeneficial impact on the poor.\nV.  THE LOANS\n57. ADB will provide two loans totaling $350 million from its ordinary capital resources\n(OCR) to the Government, as the Borrower for forwarding to the State Government and GEB (or\nits successor entities with the prior approval of ADB). The loans will carry interest at the ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate for US dollar loans, and will also be subject to a 1 percent\nfront-end fee, as well as applicable commitment charges in accordance with ADB's policy on\nOCR loans. The loans are (i) a Program Loan of $150 million with a maturity of 15 years\nincluding a grace period of 3 years, to be disbursed in three equal tranches of $50 million each\nupon compliance with policy conditions as specified in paras. 65-67, and (ii) a Project Loan of\n$200 million with a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period.\nA.  The Program Loan\n1.  Amount, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n58. The Program Loan of $150 million will be provided from ADB's OCR resources. The\ncounterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the\nGovernment  to the State Government under normal arrangements for the transfer of external\nassistance. The funds transferred to the State Government will be treated as \u201cadditional\u201d to the\nGovernment's transfers allocated annually to the State Government. The Government will bear\nthe foreign exchange risk on the loan.\n59. The State Government is expected to incur the following costs of adjustments over the\nreform period.\n(i)  Rationalizing of electricity duty is expected to cause a revenue loss of about\nRs1,500  million  ($33  million)  each  year  in  the  next  five  years  for  a  total  of\n$165 million.", "17\n(ii)  Long-term loans to GEB to retire expensive commercial debt and adjust IPP prices\nwill be about Rs2,000 million ($43 million).\n(iii)  Payment of arrears of dues of municipalities and other local bodies until FY2000\nwill cost about Rs700 million ($15 million). It is expected that in FY2001, an\nadditional $5 million may be required.\n(iv)  About 700,000 consumer meters will be procured and installed over the next three\nyears. While the meters will be procured under the Project, their installation will be\nfinanced by the State Government. At $10 per meter, this works out to $7 million.\n60. The total cost of adjustment to be incurred by the State Government over the reform\nperiod is estimated at $235 million. It is felt that the Program Loan of $150 million is adequate and\njustified considering the cost of adjustments incurred by the State Government on account of the\nreforms and the political costs it will incur during implementation.\n2.  Executing Agencies\n61. The  Executing  Agencies  will  be  the  Finance  Department  and  the  Energy  and\nPetrochemicals Department of the State Government.\n3.  Procurement and Disbursement\n62. The proceeds of the Program Loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange\ncosts (excluding the local duties and taxes) of imports produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s\nmember countries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) and\nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. All procurement will be through\nnormal  commercial  practices  in  case  of  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  prescribed\nprocedures acceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the public sector, having due\nregard for the principles of economy and efficiency.\n4.  Counterpart Funds\n63. Counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  Program  Loan  will  be  transferred  by  the\nGovernment  to  the  State  Government  and  will  be  used  by  the  State  Government  under\narrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the financial restructuring of GEB and adjustment\ncosts associated with the Sector Development Program, including (i) reduction of the accounts\npayable of GEB to power producers and suppliers of fuel and transport, (ii) retirement of the\nexpensive  commercial  debt  of  GEB,  (iii)  payment  of  outstanding  municipal  dues,\n(iv) rationalization of electricity duty, and (v) reduction of IPP tariffs through buyout of debt.\n5.  Monitoring and Tranching\na.  Tranche 1: $50 million\n64. The first tranche of $50 million of the Program Loan will be released upon fulfillment of\nthe following actions. This release is anticipated in December 2000.\n(i) establishment of the GERC;\n(ii) approval of the Gujarat Electricity Industry (Reorganization and Regulation) Bill,\n2000 (the  Bill) by the State Government\u2019s Cabinet, and its submission by the\nState Government to the Government for its approval;", "18\n(iv)  first tariff award by GERC;\n(v)  incorporation and establishment of Gujarat State Electricity Company Limited\n(GSECL)  and  Gujarat  Energy  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GETCL).\nConstitution of their boards of directors, with at least two directors being from\nnon-governmental sector who are experts in their related fields;\n(vi)  circulation by GEB of a draft action plan to meter all consumers for consumer\nconsultation, in accordance with GERC\u2019s order of 10 October 2000;\n(vii)  approval  by  the  State  Government  of  the  structure,  human  resources,  and\nbudget of GERC for the next five years; and\n(viii)  payment by the State Government of all municipality dues owed to GEB up to 31\nMarch 2000.\nb.  Tranche 2: $50 million\n65. The second tranche of $50 million of the Program Loan will be released upon fulfillment\nof the following actions. This release is anticipated in June 2001.\n(i)  transfer of Gandhinagar and Utran power stations from GEB to GSECL;\n(ii)  offset of subsidy and subvention arrears owed by the State Government to GEB\nuntil 31 March 2000, and payment of outstanding municipality dues by the State\nGovernment to GEB until 31 March 2001;\n(iii)  introduction of the Bill in the Gujarat State Assembly for its consideration;\n(iv)  rationalization and reduction of electricity duty in the State Government\u2019s budget\nfor FY2002, in an amount not less than Rs1,500 million; and\n(v)  filing by GEB before GERC of the action plan to meter all consumers in the state,\nin a phase manner over a period of three years from 10 October 2000, the date\nof GERC' first tariff award.\nc.  Tranche 3: $50 million\n66. The third tranche of $50 million of the Program Loan will be released upon fulfillment of\nthe following actions. This release is anticipated in June 2002.\n(i)  transfer of transmission assets from GEB to GETCL;\n(ii)  agreement  between  the  State  Government,  GEB,  and  ADB  on  the\nReorganization Plan for GEB and solicitation for privatization of at least one\nidentified distribution area of GEB, unless contrary to the Reorganization plan;\n(iii) the rules and regulations under the Bill as enacted (the Act) laid before the\nGujarat State Assembly and published in the Official Gazette;\n(iv) second tariff submission by GEB to GERC; and", "19\n(vi)  establishment and operationalization of GERC under the Act.\nB.  The Project Loan\n1.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n67. The Project Loan of $200 million will be provided from ADB's OCR resources. The loan\nproceeds  will  be  transferred  by  the  Government  to  the  State  Government  under  normal\narrangements for transfer of such external assistance and will be treated as \u201cadditional\u201d to the\nGovernment\u2019s normal transfers to the State Government. The State Government will onlend the\nloan proceeds to GEB, under a subsidiary loan agreement, at an interest rate of 12 percent per\nannum with a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The interest rate of\n12 percent per annum is in line with the interest being charged by commercial institutions in\nIndia for lending to power utilities. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on the\nProject Loan.\n2.  Implementation Arrangements\n68. GEB (or its successor entities with prior agreement of ADB) will be the Executing Agency\nfor the Project. Separate groups have been created in GEB to implement the project components.\nGEB assisted by its Planning Group will monitor the implementation of Project components on a\nquarterly basis and direct suitable action as may be required to support the implementing groups.\nSince GEB has no expertise in formulating and executing drip irrigation systems, it will seek the\nsupport of the Water Resources Engineering and Management Institute of the University at\nBaroda,  or  other  consultants  who  have  had  experience  in  implementing  such  systems.  For\nbeneficiary participation during implementation, a review committee comprising representatives of\nthe State Government, GEB, the consultant, and the village leaders/farmers will be constituted.\n3.  Implementation Schedule and Performance Review\n69. Project Implementation will commence in January 2001 and be completed in December\n2004  (Appendix  10).  Direct  supervision  of  implementation  and  monitoring  the  operational\nperformance of the components will be the responsibility of GEB, which will submit semi-annual\nprogress reports to the State Government and ADB within 30 days from the end of each half-year.\nADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and meet\nwith GEB, the State Government, and the Government at least semiannually to discuss Project\nprogress. ADB will also monitor the overall financial and technical performance of the state\u2019s\npower sector, and the State Government's fiscal position.\n4.  Procurement\n70. ADB financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\nfor Procurement. For such procurement, bidding documents will be prepared in a manner to\nensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding (ICB). Each supply contract\nestimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Each\ncontract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of\ninternational shopping. ADB's funds will not be used to fund procurement under local competitive\nbidding  procedures.  A list  of  the  major  contract  packages  under  the  Project  with  their  cost\nestimates is in Appendix 11. Advance procurement action has been allowed and about six\ncontract packages with a  total bid value of $105 million will be approved for bidding by December\n2000. Retroactive financing has not been allowed.", "20\n5.  Consulting Services\n71. For  the  drip  irrigation  component,  GEB  will  appoint  within  three  months  of  loan\neffectiveness, the Water Resources Engineering and Management Institute of the MS University\nat Baroda or any other competent consultant, under its own financing, to design drip irrigation\nsystems  for  the  areas  identified,  prepare  specifications  for  the  materials  to  be  procured,\ncoordinate  with  GEB  for  procurement,  oversee  installation,  and  provide  post  installation\nmonitoring and assistance to GEB and the farmers for two years. Since these services are being\nfinanced entirely by GEB, ADB's guidelines for selection of consultants will not apply.\n6.  Disbursement Procedures\n72. Since the disbursements under the Project will be mainly for supply of goods, ADB's\ncommitment and direct payment procedures will be used for disbursement purposes.\n7.  Reports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n73. GEB will prepare separate progress reports for its respective components and submit\nthem to ADB on a semi-annual basis within 30 days of the end of each half-year. The reports will\nbe a narrative description of progress made during the period, changes to the implementation\nschedule, problems or difficulties encountered, the performance of the project implementation\nconsultants, and work to be carried out in the upcoming period. The reports will include a\nsummary financial account for the Project consisting of project expenditures during the period,\nyear to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of\nthe  Project  based  on  these  reports  and  meet  with  the  Executing  Agencies  and  the  State\nGovernment at least semiannually to discuss progress of the Project. Completion reports will be\nsubmitted to ADB within three months of Project completion.\n74. GEB will have its annual financial statements, including the income statement, balance\nsheet, and sources and application of funds statement, audited by a professional auditing firm\nacceptable to ADB. Audited statements will be submitted to ADB within nine months of the close\nof the financial year. GEB will also submit to ADB audited project accounts and the auditors'\nobservations with respect to compliance with the loan covenants.\nC.  The Executing Agency\n1.  Responsibilities\n75. GEB is a statutory body created under the Indian Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948. Its\nobjectives are to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity in the state of Gujarat except in those\nareas licensed to other distributors. Over the years, GEB also promoted organizations in the\npower sector in Gujarat such as the Gujarat Power Corporation (50 percent share) and the\nGujarat Industrial Power Corporation (about 25 percent share). In addition, GEB supports the\nState Government in the sector through assistance on sector development plans and safety and\ninspection functions.\n2.  Organization Structure\n76.

Sales revenue has consistently increased from Rs43.2 billion in FY1997 to Rs57.4 billion\nin FY2000.  However, net income before subsidy has been negative mainly due to the heavily\nsubsidized agriculture tariff. Agricultural consumers, the largest consumer category of GEB\u2019s\nsales mix, were charged only Re0.15 per kWh, which is less than one tenth of the cost of power\nin FY2000.", "22\n79. In FY2000, GEB\u2019s profitability continued to decline mainly because (i) the average cost\nof power purchases significantly increased from Rs2.41per kWh to Rs2.59 per kWh, (ii) share of\npower purchase from non-GEB generation increased from 41.2 percent to 46.6 percent, and (iii)\nretail tariffs had not been raised since May 1993 despite the increase in the cost of power. In\nOctober  1996,  tariffs  were  increased  for  limited  consumer  categories:  industrial  (LT)  by\n10 percent, industrial (HT) by 28 percent, railway by 31 percent, and Bulk by 11 percent. As a\nresult, net deficit before subsidy reached Rs35.6 billion in FY2000. With  subsidy, GEB has\nbeen allowed to calculate only a zero percent rate of return on net fixed assets and not the three\npercent rate of return as stipulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948.\n80. The profit and net income figures of GEB continue to deteriorate far below the break-\neven point. The usual calculation of financial ratios has been abandoned due to its lack of\nrelevant numbers; both the debt service coverage ratio and self-financing ratio are negative.\nb.  Projected Financial Performance\n81. GEB\u2019s  projected financial  performance is summarized in Table 7. With the reform\nmeasures  to  be  implemented  under  the  Sector  Development  Program,  GEB's  financial\nperformance is expected to improve significantly in the coming years. While the actual levels of\ntariffs will be set by the GERC, the minimum cost recovery requirements set by the Bill will\nfavorably influence tariff awards by GERC. The compulsory metering of all consumers will help\nreduce unaccounted for sales of energy. Rationalization and reduction in electricity duty are\nexpected to halt further deterioration of consumer mix. On the other hand, due to the state's\nbudget constraints, subsidy to GEB is being capped at Rs11,000 million every year. As a result,\na substantial tariff increase is necessary for the heavily subsidized agriculture consumers.\nTable 7: Summary of GEB\u2019s Projected Financial Performance\n(Rs million)\nItem FY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009\nPower Generation 45,040 45,758 46,451 47,278 49,655 52,564 56,050 59,831 63,936\n&  Purchase\n(GWh)\nT & D Losses (%) 30.0 26.0 23.0 20.0 19.0 18.0 18.0 18.0 18.0\nPower  Sales 31,528 33,861 35,767 37,822 40,221 43,102 45,961 49,062 52,428\n(GWh)\nSales Revenue 71,544 92,344 109,831 125,042 140,662 158,578 176,205 195,666 217,563\nGross Profit (9,166) (1,731) 4,408 10,176 8,125 9,853 9,471 16,061 24,078\nNet  Income (31,800) (26,132) (20,159) (14,804) (17,115) (18,227) (19,120) (13,255) (4,508)\nBefore Subsidy\nNet  Income  After (18,640) (15,132) (9,159) (3,804) (6,115) (7,227) (8,120) (2,255) 6,492\nSubsidy\nSubsidy 11,000 11,000 11,000 11,000 11,000 11,000 11,000 11,000 11,000\nNet Fixed Assets 84,075 74,751 74,964 74,236 70,859 63,935 58,496 52,941 47,270\nLong-Term Loans 39,727 40,539 42,124 44,416 45,738 44,300 42,972 41,644 40,316\nFunds from State 44,077 47,967 47,967 47,967 47,967 47,967 47,967 47,967 47,967\nGovernment\nROR on Net Fixed (39.7) (31.0) (16.6) (7.2) (11.8) (14.3) (16.9) (5.3) 17.7\nAssets (%)\nDebt Service (0.2) 0.1 0.4 0.7 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.9 1.3\n Coverage  Ratio\n(times)\nSource: staff estimates\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, ROR = rate of return, T&D = transmission and distribution.", "23\n82. The projected average retail tariff per kWh for each consumer category is presented in\nTable 8. The projected tariff increases are necessary for GEB to recover from its current\nfinancial position and to become a financially sound corporation by FY2009. The first tariff\naward given by GERC in October 2000 was very encouraging in this regard. The agriculture\ntariff was increased from Re0.15 per kWh to approximately Re0.80 per kWh. It is anticipated\nthat GERC will continue to fulfill its mandate of ensuring a sustainable electricity sector in\nGujarat, in terms of both efficiency and financial soundness.\nTable 8: Average Cost of Power and Category-wise Tariff\n(Rs/kWh, excluding electricity duty and sales tax)\nFY2000 FY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009\n(Prov) (Budget) (Proj) (Proj) (Proj) (Proj) (Proj) (Proj) (Proj) (Proj)\nOverall  Average 1.79 2.20 2.42 2.97 3.20 3.39 3.56 3.71 3.86 4.02\nRetail Tariff\nDomestic/ 2.10 2.19 2.41 2.53 2.66 2.79 2.93 3.07 3.23 3.39\nResidential\nCommercial 3.84 4.05 4.46 4.68 4.91 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00\nIndustrial (LT) 3.49 3.70 4.07 4.27 4.49 4.71 4.95 5.00 5.00 5.00\nIndustrial (HT) 4.09 4.17 4.59 4.82 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00\nPublic Lighting 2.63 2.74 3.01 3.16 3.32 3.49 3.66 3.85 4.04 4.24\nRailways 4.63 4.70 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00\nAgriculture a 0.15 0.80 1.00 1.15 1.32 1.52 1.75 2.01 2.31 2.6\nPublic Water 1.24 1.29 1.42 1.49 1.56 1.64 1.72 1.81 1.90 2.00\nWorks\nBulk Supply 2.36 2.42 2.66 2.80 2.93 3.08 3.24 3.40 3.57 3.75\nSource: Staff estimates\nHT = high tension,  LT = low tension, Prov. = Provisional,  Proj. = Projected\na\n  The agriculture tariff shown is net of subsidies. With subsidies, the legal requirement of covering 67 per cent of cost\nof supply is met  from FY2003 onwards.\n83. The financial projections in Table 7 and Appendix 13 present a likely scenario during the\nProgram period. It includes accounting for possible slippages in the metering program, resulting\nin a slower rate of reclassification of consumption from agricultural to other categories, and a\nslower increase in the tariff for agricultural consumers than that mandated by law. To achieve\nthe  results  shown,  GEB  needs  to  improve  both  its  technical  operations  and  financial\nmanagement.  The financial results also depend on GERC continuing with modest annual tariff\nincreases  of  about  10  percent  for  each  category.  This  scenario,  including  the  State\nGovernment's subsidies, is fully consistent with the medium-term fiscal consolidation plan of the\nState Government for achieving sustainability of the public finances.\n84. A higher performance scenario is indeed feasible if three specific actions take place. If (i)\nthe large number of meters required to meter all consumers are bought and installed during a\nthree-year period as mandated by the Act; (ii) as a result of the metering and consequent\nreclassification of consumers, agricultural consumption, as a percentage of total consumption,\ndecreases from the existing 43 percent to 25 percent, and the consumption above 25 percent is\nreclassified on an equal basis among the domestic, commercial, and LT industrial consumers;\nand (iii) bold annual actions are taken by GERC on agricultural tariff increases to achieve\n67 percent of cost of supply by FY2006 without subsidies, GEB will achieve a positive net\nincome  (without  subsidies)  of  Rs2,340  million  in  FY2004.    This  means  that  from  FY2004\nonward, the annual subsidy of Rs11,000 million could be fully phased out, or, alternatively, the", "24\ntariff for supply to industry and commercial sectors decreased. In this more optimistic scenario,\nreduction in budgetary subsidies could be achieved even earlier.\nVI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n1.  Reorganization Plan for GEB\na.  Objectives and Scope\n85. ADB and the State Government have discussed and agreed that there are several\nmodels that could be applied for restructuring of GEB. All have merits and demerits. The\nfollowing common aspects of restructuring were agreed to by both sides.\n(i) One generation company (GSECL) has been created to which all units of GEB\u2019s\nGandhinagar  thermal  power  station  and  Utran  thermal  power  station  will  be\ntransferred within six months of the date of Loan approval.\n(ii) A statewide transmission company (GETCL) has been created (incorporated but\nyet to be operationalized). GEB\u2019s transmission assets pertaining to voltage levels\nof 66 kV and above will be transferred to GETCL within the first year after Loan\napproval.\n(iii)  the  State  Government,  GEB,  and  ADB  will  jointly  develop  the  model  for\nrestructuring under a reorganization plan, before the release of the third tranche\nof the Program component of the Sector Development Program Loan. This is\nexpected to be completed within 18 months after the date of Loan approval.\nFurther, work needs to be done to finalize the model: (a) segregating the assets\nand liabilities for the identified distribution areas; (b) establishing the tariffs to be\ncharged to consumers in each distribution area based on a range of consumer\nmix and generation scenarios; and (c) developing a mechanism for addressing\nsubsidies within and across distribution areas. The suitability of each model will\nbe judged against such criteria as (a) efficiency of delivery, (b) maximizing the\nbenefits  of  competition,  (c) least  cost  to  the  consumers,  and  (d)  maximizing\ncontribution to sustainable public finances by lowering subsidies and limiting\ncross-subsidies.\n86. ADB will provide TA to (i) help establish the optimal model for the sector structure and\nprepare a reorganization plan; (ii) identify the distribution area for privatization, or other modes\nof reorganization as recommended by the plan; (iii) conduct the necessary studies and prepare\nthe documents necessary for inviting bidders; and (iv) help in evaluating the offers received for\npurchase of shares in the distribution entity.  The TA will also assist in matters relating to\n(i) rationalization  of  GEB\u2019s  personnel;  (ii) unfunded  liabilities  of  GEB;  and  (iii)  costs  of\nadjustments. It is agreed that all privatization and reorganization will be done in an open,\ncompetitive, and transparent manner. Outline terms of reference for the TA and cost estimates\nare given in Appendix 14.\nb.  Implementing Arrangements\n87. The TA will be implemented starting March 2001 and be completed in 18 months. The\nState Government and GEB will be the Executing Agencies. Formulating the reorganization plan\nwith all its associated studies will be completed within the first six months after consultants are\nappointed.  Workshops  for  sensitizing  GEB  staff  will  also  be  completed  within  this  period.", "25\nImmediately  thereafter,  implementation  will  start.  If  so  indicated  under  the  plan,  the  first\ndistribution area will be privatized shortly thereafter.\nc.  Reporting Requirements\n88. The consultants will submit the following reports to the State Government, GEB and\nADB:\n(i)  inception report within four weeks after the start  of the TA. In addition to outlining\na detailed work program and describing the work steps proposed to fulfill the\nterms  of  reference,  the  report  will  outline  the  approaches  to  be  adopted  in\nreorganizing public enterprises.\n \n(ii)  interim report within 2 months of the start of consulting services.  This will include\nthe preliminary blueprints for reorganizing and divestment of shares in public\nsector companies including the required financial and labor reorganization.  The\nreport will also outline the arrangements for the workshop and the training and\ninformation seminars to be conducted. After a review of the interim report, the\nState Government, GEB, ADB, and the team of consultants will meet to discuss\nprogress  under  the  TA  and  to  finalize  the  arrangements  for  the\nworkshop/seminars.\n \n(iii)  Draft final report on the reorganization plan within four months of the start of\nconsulting  services.    This  report  will  include  the  consultants\u2019  findings  and\nrecommendations on reorganizing, divestment and public enterprises, details on\nmeasures already implemented and their impact, as well as feedback from the\nconsultants\u2019 participation in the seminars. The report will also outline the strategy\nto foster private sector enterprise development. The recommendations of the\ndraft final report will be discussed at a meeting between the State Government,\nGEB, ADB and the consultants. The final report, incorporating the comments of\nthe State Government, GEB, and ADB, will be prepared within two weeks of the\nmeeting.\n(iv)  If consistent with the reorganizing strategy as proposed in the final report on the\nreorganization plan, the Consultants will prepare documents for inviting private\nsector participation in one distribution area of Gujarat, within one month of the\napproval of the Report. The document will include (a) prequalification documents\nwith the associated evaluation criteria and bid form; and (b) bid documents with\nassociated evaluation criteria and bid form.\n(v)  Evaluation reports of the bidding at each stage of the process.\nd.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n89. It is anticipated that 24 person-months of consulting services (9 international and 15\ndomestic) will be required over 18 months.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $770,000\nequivalent, comprising $500,000 in foreign exchange and $270,000 equivalent in local currency.\nADB will finance $600,000, consisting of the entire foreign exchange portion of the costs and\n$100,000 equivalent in local currency from the ADB-funded TA program. GEB will finance a\nlocal currency cost of $170,000 equivalent that will include provision of the counterpart facilities\n(para. 91).", "26\ne.  Counterpart Facilities\n90. GEB will provide counterpart facilities to the TA consultants as follows:\n(i)  Internet connection,\n(ii)  local telephone, fax connection,\n(iii)  photocopying facilities,\n(iv)  transport within Gujarat,\n(v)  office accommodation with secretarial staff support,\n(vi)  venue and services for workshops and seminars, and\n(vii)  counterpart staff for conducting surveys, preparation of literature, etc.\n2.  Consumer Awareness and Participation in Power Sector Reforms\na.  Objectives and Scope\n91. There was a felt need to educate consumer groups and, through them, the general\npublic, regarding the changes being introduced in the sector. After consultations with the State\nGovernment, GEB and several consumer groups, it was agreed that ADB would fund TA to\nfacilitate consumer awareness and participation in power sector reforms. The TA will fund a\ncoordination group of consumers\u2019 representative bodies (tentatively named as the Electricity\nConsumers Coordination Forum or ECCF)  that would meet periodically to be informed by the\nState Government and GEB of reform actions taken and their implications for consumers, and to\nseek feedback from them. These representatives would then hold seminars to disseminate the\ninformation and views to their members. Direct access to the public, through the media, may\nalso be necessary to broaden understanding of the reforms.  The terms reference for the TA are\ngiven in Appendix 15.\nb.  Implementing Arrangements\n92. The TA will commence in February 2001 and be completed one year thereafter. The\nConfederation of Indian Industry-Gujarat Chapter (CII) will act as the organizer and secretariat\nfor the ECCF and be Executing Agency for the TA. For each workshop to be funded under the\nTA, ECCF, through CII, will forward to ADB its proposal for the workshop, indicating (i) the\nvenue and other arrangements; (ii) the likely participants amongst consumer groups and other\nstakeholders; (iii) experts, if any, to be invited to address the workshop; and (iv) a summary of\ncosts to be incurred. ADB will indicate its concurrence with the proposal with suggestions for\npossible changes, if so desired. At the conclusion of each workshop ECCF will submit a short\nreport on (i) its salient conclusions; (ii) materials prepared to disseminate its conclusions; and\n(iii) a detailed account of the expenditure pertaining to the items financed by ADB under the TA.\nc.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n93. The total cost of the TA will be $ 65,000 equivalent, of which $30,000 will be in foreign\nexchange and $35,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will fund from the ADB-funded TA\nprogram, the entire foreign exchange cost plus $20,000 equivalent in local currency for a total of\n$50,000 equivalent. ECCF will finance the balance of $15,000. Cost estimates are in Appendix\n15.", "27\nd.  Counterpart Facilities\n94. The  non-governmental  organizations  constituting  ECCF  will  provide  all  personnel\nrequired to support the ECCF, free of cost to the ECCF. CII will also provide, free of cost to\nECCF,  day-to-day  secretarial  and  communications  assistance,  for  which  a  lump  sum\nreimbursement of $1,000 per quarter, will be considered under the TA.\n3.  Support to GERC\na.  Objectives and Scope\n95.  ADB and the State Government have agreed on the need to support GERC during the\ninitial phase of its establishment and operation to enable it to prepare key rules and regulations\nunder the Act. Outline terms of reference for the TA are given in Appendix 16.\nb.  Implementing Arrangements\n96. The TA will be implemented starting February 2001 and be completed in 18 months. Full\noperationalization of GERC, including drafting of all required codes, rules, regulations and\nprocedures, will be completed within the first six months after consultants are appointed. The\nworkshop for GERC and utilities staff should also be completed within this period. External and\nin-house training and operational support to GERC will end after one year.\n97.  As a first step, key regulations and codes, which are required immediately after passing\nof the Act and a tariff and regulations concept paper will be drafted. The draft regulations and\ncodes and the tariff concept paper will be discussed in a workshop comprising of a wide-\nselection of stakeholders in the sector. After the workshop, GERC will give the consultants\ndetailed comments, based on which the regulations will be finalized.\n98. Parallel with the drafting of regulations, a training needs analysis will be undertaken for\nGERC\u2019s staff on the basis of which an appropriate external and in\u2013house training program will\nbe  developed.  The  final  external  training  program,  indicating  objectives,  duration,  cost\nestimates, and staff who should attend, will be discussed and agreed upon with ADB before its\nimplementation. The in-house training program will complement the external training program\nand will include presentations by staff who have participated/will participate in external training.\n99. The external training program will be implemented after the first draft of regulations is\ncompleted. At such time, the training participants will have already gained a deeper appreciation\nof the key elements of the role of GERC, the different pricing concepts and their implications\nand alternative structures of power sector regulation. The lessons from external training will be\ndisseminated by the training participants through a series of workshops and seminars for other\nGERC staff as well as other sector stakeholders.\n100. Operational support to GERC will be provided in parallel with the drafting of the key\nregulations. The contribution of GERC staff to the final drafting of key regulations and of\nsecondary  regulations  will  reflect  the  increased  sense  of  ownership  and  operational\nunderstanding of the regulatory framework following external training. The workshops bringing\ntogether a broad segment of sector participants will also contribute to more transparency in the\nregulatory process and thus, to a broader acceptance of the role and independence of GERC.", "28\nc.  Reporting\n101. A list of key deliverables will be produced under the TA:\n(i) regulatory procedures,\n(ii) rules for the regulatory commission,\n(iii) transmission and distribution licenses,\n(iv) codes and standards,\n(v) tariff and regulations concept paper, and\n(vi) scheme and training needs analysis.\nd.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n102. It is anticipated that the TA will require a total of 10 person-months of consultants\u2019 input\nover  18 months.  The  team  of  consultants  (person-months  are  in  parenthesis)  include  an\ninternational lawyer (3), technical expert (3), tariff and commercial expert (3), and a human\nresources development expert (1). The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent,\ncomprising $450,000 in foreign exchange and $150,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will\nfinance $450,000, consisting of the entire foreign exchange portion of the costs from the ADB-\nfunded TA program. GERC will finance the local currency cost of $150,000 equivalent in kind\nthrough counterpart facilities (para. 103).\ne. Counterpart Facilities\n103. GERC will provide counterpart facilities to the TA consultants as follows:\n(i)  Internet connection,\n(ii)  local telephone, fax connection,\n(iii)  photocopying facilities,\n(iv)  tansport within Gujarat,\n(v)  office accommodation with secretarial staff support,\n(vi)  venue and services for workshops and seminars, and\n(vii)  domestic consultants for conducting surveys, preparation of literature, etc.\n4.  Support to Distribution Profit Centers\n104. GEB  expressed  a  requirement  for  medium-term  multidisciplinary  training  of  its\nsuperintending engineers who are the managers of its Kheda and Rajkot distribution circles as\nwell as for their immediate subordinates who will be responsible for managing the distribution\ndivisions  in  these  circles.  ADB  has  sought  the  assistance  of  bilateral  cofinanciers  who  are\ninterested  in  organizing  such  training  from  reputed  electricity  distribution  companies  in  their\ncountries.\nVII.  BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Expected Impacts\n1.  Financial Analysis\n105. Financial evaluation was undertaken for components A, B, and C together since they are\nrelated, and separately for component D because of its \u201cstand-alone\u201d nature. The financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) of each project component is satisfactory compared with GEB\u2019s\nweighted average real cost of capital (WACC) of 6.2 percent.  The FIRR for each individual", "29\nsubproject and the sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 9. The major assumptions used\nin the financial evaluation of the Project and detailed calculations are in Appendix 17.\nTable 9: Sensitivity Analysis of the Financial Internal Rate of Return\nComponents A, B, and C Component D\nScenario\nBase Case 8.9 15.3\na. 10% Increase in Capital Cost 8.3 13.3\nb. One Year Delay 6.6 13.4\nc. 10% Decrease in Tariffs Negative 13.1\nd. a + b 6.3 11.6\n106. The sensitivity analysis for components A, B, and C confirmed the evident knowledge\nthat any decrease in tariffs would result in a negative financial contribution of the project\ncomponents. The likelihood of this event-taking place is minimal since the GERC has been\nestablished and is mandated to award tariffs as per the Act. The FIRR does react negatively to\na 10 percent increase in the capital cost and a one-year delay in project completion. However,\nthe reduction in the FIRR does not go below the WACC of 6.2 percent. Accordingly, the Project\ncomponents are financially sound to withstand such exigencies. The drip irrigation component\nhas proven to withstand all sensitivities tested due to its robust base FIRR.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n107. As part of its private power generation policy, the Government has invited private sector\ninvestment to increase generation capacity in Gujarat. Proposals have been solicited for about\n4,400 MW of generating capacity on a build-own-operate basis. A number of power purchasing\nagreements have been signed, among which are those for the Reliance and Akrimota IPPs with\na combined capacity of 750 MW. For evacuation of power from the new plants, complementary\ninvestments in transmission and distribution facilities are required.  Component A of the Project\nincludes the construction of dedicated transmission facilities for the two IPPs, while components\nB and C are dedicated to overall system upgrading. The system-strengthening investments also\nwill indirectly benefit evacuation from the IPPs in addition to minimizing losses and utilizing\nsurplus  capacity  available  at  other,  state  and  central,  power  stations.  Therefore,  the\ntransmission components were evaluated together with the proposed IPP plants they will serve,\nand also together with the distribution components of the project investments.\n108. The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is estimated at\n25.36 percent.  The  EIRR  was  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years,  including  a  four-year\nconstruction period, corresponding to the estimated useful life of the Project. No residual value\nwas considered. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis indicated that the EIRR is adequate except\nfor changes in the overall benefit stream. A 4 percent reduction of the overall benefit stream will\nresult in an EIRR of 12 percent. However, expected that as a result of the reforms, the benefit\nstream will improve and not deteriorate. Details of the sensitivity analysis are in Appendix 18.\n109. The economic analysis was carried out at border price level using FY2000 prices. To\nconvert financial capital cost into economic cost, taxes and duties were deducted. No price\ncontingencies are included in the base capital cost but, the economic capital costs include 10\npercent  physical  contingencies.  The  costs  were  separated  into  foreign  exchange,  indirect\nforeign exchange and local currency costs. Local costs were further separated and specific\nconversion factors used for unskilled labor. The remaining local costs were converted to border\nprice level by applying a standard conversion factor. Annual operation and maintenance cost", "30\nwere also calculated in economic prices as a percentage of the total capital investment cost.\nThe cost of energy at generation level is valued at the IPP takeoff prices for project component\nA, separately for each IPP, and at GEB\u2019s power purchase pool price for the additional units\nresulting from components B and C. Transmission and distribution losses of 20 percent were\ndeducted from the IPP send-out volume, but the full send-out volume was priced in the cost of\nenergy.\n110. The  economic  benefits  of  electricity  consumption  were  calculated  for  each  major\nconsumer  category.  Nonincremental  electricity  consumption  benefits  were  based  on  the\nalternative economic costs of other energy sources such as diesel generators and kerosene\nlamps that will be replaced by using electricity. Incremental, or induced, consumption was\nvalued at the estimated average willingness to pay for electricity based on a weighted average\nof the alternative costs of providing similar energy-related services and the current electricity\ntariff for each consumer category. The evaluation is described in more detail in Appendix 18.\n111. For project component D no quantitative economic evaluation was undertaken due to the\nchallenge of determining the depletion premium for groundwater. In Mahesana district, which\nwas selected for implementing of a pilot scheme for converting of irrigation systems, the water\ntable has dropped by about 160 m over the last 25 years.  A GEB-supported study17 in the four\nsubdistricts in Mahesana to be covered by the pilot scheme found a negative net draft recharge\n3\nranging from minus 20 to minus 33 million cubic meters (m ) year. If groundwater depletion\ncontinues at this rate, in a few years time irrigated agricultural activity in the district will be\nseverely limited or might even have to be replaced entirely by rainfed agriculture. Some deep\ntubewells  have  yielded  high  contents  of  fluorides  and  other  salts,  and  there  is  danger  of\npermanent damage to soil quality.\n112. The use of tubewell (lift) irrigation by farmers without detailed knowledge of the irrigation\nmethodology, and in an environment of almost no financial costs for water and electricity, has\nresulted in highly inefficient resource use. The study found very low water use efficiency and low\nproductivity per irrigated hectare.  Yields per hectare could double for most typical crops with a\nshift from lift to drip irrigation, in addition to conserving water and electricity.\n113. A sample calculation for five different crops showed that the average discharge of a\n3 3 \ntubewell is 108 m  water for per hour or in an annual discharge of 194,400 m of water for 20\n3\nhectares. With drip irrigation only 40,800 m  water will be required for the same area. The net\nwater saving of about 70percent,  would allow a sustainable recharging of the tubewells leading\nto sustained agricultural activities. Data on depletion rates, recharging rates, and water use will\nbe collected from the pilot scheme and the Project could be expanded after analysis of the data.\n3.  Environmental and Social Dimensions\n114. The Sector Development Program is designed to promote economic growth by increasing\nelectricity supply in Gujarat, including the rural areas. It will provide a reliable power supply thereby\nimproving industrialization and providing employment opportunities. A reliable supply of electricity\nwill also enhance education, health, and other social facilities. The Sector Development Program\ndirectly addresses poverty reduction because many of the beneficiaries are unserved domestic\nconsumers, both rural and urban who, until now, have not secured connections from GEB due to\nlack of funds.  The Sector Development Program yields very attractive economic returns since it also\n                  \n17 Final Report of \u2018Installing Drip Irrigation System in the area of Mahesana District\u2019 prepared by Water Resources\nEngineering and Management Institute, M.S. University of Baroda, commissioned by GEB, January 1999.", "31\nhelps industrial and commercial consumers; with increasing employment opportunities as a result of\nfaster economic growth, it further helps the poor.\n115. Although the Sector Development Program is essentially gender neutral, benefits to women\nas a result of electricity supply are education, security, and more comfortable living. Increasing\nindustrialization will also enable women to obtain jobs and enhance their security and status in\nsociety.\n116. The  Sector  Development  Program  improves  the  delivery  of  social  services  such  as\neducation, health, and water supply and sanitation, especially to the poor, by making available for\nsuch activities funds that today are being used to subsidize the electricity sector.\nB.  Risks and Safeguards\n117. The  Sector  Development  Program  has  several  perceived  risks.  The  risks  and  their\ncorresponding mitigating measures are summarized here.\n(i) Establishment of regulatory authority.  The success of the entire reform effort is\nbased  on  the  premise  that  actions  in  the  power  sector  will  be  commercially\noriented, including rationalization of the tariff structure which would encourage\nimprovements in operating efficiencies and enable utilities to earn a fair return on\ncapital  invested  commensurate  with  their  performance.  Recognizing  that\npoliticization  of  the  tariff-setting  process  has  been  a  major  factor  for  the\ndeterioration  of  the  electricity  supply  industry  all  over  India,  the  Sector\nDevelopment  Program  envisages  the  establishment  of  a  statutory  regulatory\nauthority whose responsibilities will include tariff setting and licensing. The Bill\ncreating  the  regulatory  authority  also  incorporates  provisions  setting  stringent\neligibility requirements for its members so as to ensure appropriate working of the\nauthority. As advance preparation action, the draft Bill has already been approved\nby the State Government and has been referred to the Government for clearance\nprior to its introduction in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly for its consideration.\n(ii) Enforcement  of  Decisions.  Decisions  of  the  regulatory  authority  have  to  be\nenforced by the sector entities, often with the support of the State Government.\nTherefore, there has to be confidence that decisions of the regulatory authority,\nespecially those that are politically unattractive, will be supported by the State\nGovernment. To demonstrate its will to make difficult political decisions and as a\nmeasure to substantially ease the burden on GEB, GERC has raised the tariff for\nagriculture consumers fourfold from Re0.15 per kWh to Re 0.80 per kWh. This\nlevel is higher than that recommended by the Council under its Common Minimum\nNational Action Plan for the power sector and is higher than that in states that\nhave significant agriculture activities based on electricity-dependent irrigation.\n(iii) Availability of counterpart funds.  The Ninth Five-Year Plan for the Gujarat power\nsector represents the largest comparable investment in the sector by the state\nand one of the largest by any state in India. Consequently, there is a risk of\nshortfall of local counterpart funds. To mitigate this risk, the State Government\nhas budgeted sufficient funds for power sector investments under the Ninth Plan\nand has assured budgeting and transfers of sufficient counterpart funds each\nyear for the Project.", "32\n(iv) Operational effectiveness. The operational effectiveness of GEB and other power\nsector entities that will be created during the reform period will be critical in\ndetermining success or failure. To improve effectiveness, processes are being\nbuilt into the system both to demand completion of critical activities by the sector\nentities and to strengthen their capacity to deliver them on time.\n(a)  The GERC. The constitution of GERC, initially under the central Electricity\nRegulatory Commission Act and its subsequent confirmation under the\nproposed  Act,  sets  up  a  platform  for  consumers  to  scrutinize  the\nperformance of GEB and other sector entities, adding to the pressure on\nthem to perform. In consultation with all stakeholders, GERC has also\nidentified  key  activities  such  as  metering  of  consumers,  and  has\nmandated a time-bound monitoring  program for its completion. This will\nspur GEB, AECO, and SECO to complete these activities on time.\n(b) Managerial focus. The establishment of GSECL and GETCL and transfer\nof  a  part  of  GEB's  responsibilities  to  them  reduces  the  span  of\nresponsibility of GEB's management, allowing it to focus on distribution as\nits main key result area. GSECL and GETCL will also have sharper focus\nin their activities, leading to overall improvements in the sector.\n(c)  Independent profit centers. Delegation of powers reinforced by improved\nmanagerial systems and processes, and capital investments to reduce\nlosses are being introduced in Kheda (Anand), Rajkot, and Mahesana\ncircles. Support from external consultants under a bilateral cofinancier is\nalso  being  sought  to  help  the  managements  of  these  circles.  These\nimprovements at grassroots levels will greatly enhance the effectiveness\nof sector operations.\n(d)  Advance procurement action. Bids will be invited for about $100 million\nworth of procurement under advance procurement action, by December\n2000. They include all critical equipment for system strengthening and\nloss  reduction  that  will  be  required  over  the  next  two  years.  Thus,\nimplementation  of  key  activities  will  not  be  constrained  by  supply  of\nequipment.\n(e)  Induction of Experts. Action has been initiated by the State Government\nand GEB to induct experts into the boards of directors of GEB, GSECL\nand GETCL. Induction of experts into the management is being initiated.\nThe performance of these entities is expected to improve as a result of\nthese measures.\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Prior Actions by the State Government  and GEB\n118. In order to demonstrate its commitment to the structural changes proposed as part of the\nProgram, the following key actions have been completed by the State Government and GEB.\n(i) Completion of environmental investigations and preparation of a summary initial\nenvironmental examination report acceptable to ADB.", "33\n(ii)  GERC announced its first tariff award on 10 October 2000. The average rates of\nrealization  (exclusive  of  electricity  duty)  for  FY2001  have  been  raised  to  the\nfollowing levels:\nCategory Tariff Increase\n(Rs/kWh) (%)\nResidential 2.19 9.8\nCommercial 4.05 13.4\nIndustry (LT) 3.07 14.2\nIndustry (HT) 4.17 4.8\nPublic Lighting 2.74 10.4\nRailways 4.70 3.8\nPublic Water Works 1.29 9.3\nAgriculture 0.80 433.0\nSource: Staff  estimates based on GERC's order dated 10 October 2000.\n(iii) The State Government has agreed to initiate rationalization of duties and taxes on\nsale of electricity from FY2002. It has also initiated changes in the charges incident\nupon  the  supplies  of  electricity  by  GEB  and  captive  generators  to  industrial\nconsumers so as to put them on an equal footing.\n(iv) GERC, in its award of 10 October 2000, has directed that all consumers be\nmetered within 3 years of its award. GEB has circulated a proposal of installing\nmeters on all consumer connections within this defined time frame to its consumer\ngroups  for  consultations.  GEB  has  commenced  installing  meters  on  the\ntransformer feeders of agriculture connections and about 50,000 meters have\nalready been installed.\n(iv)  The State Government\u2019s Cabinet, on 23 October 2000, approved the draft Bill and\nhas forwarded it to the Government for its approval.\nB.  Covenants\n119. In addition to the standard assurances, the following specific assurances have been\ngiven by the Government and the State Government that have been incorporated in the legal\ndocuments.\n1.  General\n120. The policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreements, as\ndescribed in the Development Policy Letter, will continue in effect at least for the duration of the\nSector Development Program.\n121. The State Government will ensure that sufficient budgetary allocations are made to the\nGEB  and  the  Implementing  Agencies  in  a  timely  manner  for  the  efficient  and  timely\nimplementation of the Project. The Government will make available, counterpart funds for the\nimplementation of the Program.\n122. The  State  Government  and  GEB  agree  to  take  all  steps  to  implement  the\nrecommendations of the TAs not later than 31 December 2002, in a manner satisfactory to ADB.", "34\n123. GEB will ensure that proper metering of all consumers is carried out in a phased manner\nin the state within not more than four years from the date of Loan approval.\n2.  Administrative\n124. To enable the proper functioning of GEB\u2019s successor entities, the Government and State\nGovernment will expedite, and assist in expediting, issue of due permits and licenses as may be\nrequired by law;\n125. Within a period of 12 months from Loan effectiveness, the State Government will ensure\nthat a majority of the officers in the senior management positions of GSECL and GETCL will be\nrecruited  through  open  competitive  selection  processes  by  the  boards  of  directors  of  these\ncompanies. Further, the State Government shall ensure that the tenure of these officers shall be\nfor  at  least  three  years.  The  State  Government  will  also  progressively  recruit  experts  in\nmanagement positions in GEB.\n3.  Financial\n126. The State Government will make timely and adequate budgetary appropriations to meet\nits subsidy payment liabilities so as to ensure that all subsidy dues are paid to GEB (or its\nsuccessor entities) and other electricity utilities within not more than six months of the raising of\nthe claim by such entities. Further, the State Government shall limit agriculture subsidies to\nRs11 billion a year.\n127. In  order  to  enable  GEB  to  meet  its  operating  deficits,  GOG  will  support,  through\nproviding its guarantee, domestic market borrowings that GEB may raise for an amount of up to\nRs19,200 million during FY2001 and FY2002.\n4.  Environment and Social Measures\n128. The  State  Government  and  GEB  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in\ncompliance with all applicable rules and regulations and comply with all applicable environment\nassessment procedures under the environmental guidelines of ADB and the Government.\n5.  Program Implementation and Benefit Monitoring\n129. The State Government and GEB will undertake together with ADB, periodic reviews\nduring implementation of the Program to evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements,\nprogress and achievement of scheduled targets and agenda for policy reform, and the Project.\n6.  Restructuring of the Power Sector\n130. The  development  of  a  Reorganization  Plan  for  GEB  will  be  undertaken  in  a  fair,\ntransparent manner, and the formulation of the privatization and other schemes thereunder, to the\nextent commercially practicable, in a competitive manner.\n131. Any voluntary retirement schemes as may be recommended under the Reorganization\nPlan will be implemented with full participation and consultation of the affected persons, in\naccordance with applicable laws and regulations. GOG will make the necessary funds available\nfor such schemes in a timely manner.\n132. The Gujarat Electricity Industry Act shall be notified by GOG not later than 31 December\n2001.", "35\n7. Conditions For Loan Effectiveness\n133. In addition to the conditions set forth in ADB\u2019s Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations,\nthe following shall be conditions of Loan Effectiveness for each of the Program Loan and Project\nLoan: that The Loan and Program/Project Agreements in form and substance satisfactory to\nADB shall have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Government, the State\nGovernment and GEB respectively and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than\nthe condition requiring the effectiveness of the Agreements) shall have been fulfilled.\nIX.  RECOMMENDATION\n134. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n(i) the loan of $150,000,000 from ADB's ordinary capital resources to India for the\nGujarat Power Sector Development Program, with a term of 15 years, including a\ngrace period of 3 years, and with interest to be determined in accordance with\nADB's pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, and such\nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth\nin the draft Program Loan and Program Agreements presented to the Board; and\n(ii) the loan of $200,000,000 from ADB's ordinary capital resources to India for the\nGujarat Power Sector Development Project, with a term of 20 years, including a\ngrace period of 5 years, and with interest to be determined in accordance with\nADB's pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, and such\nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth\nin the draft Project Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\n      President \n17 November 2000", "36\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Key Sector Indicators 37 4, 12\n2 Development Policy Letter 38 7, 20\n3 External Assistance to the Power Sector 45 7, 21\n4 Program Framework 50 10, 37\n5 Project Description 53 14, 47\n6 Project Cost Estimates 56 14, 48\n7 Summary Initial Environmental Examination 60 15, 50\n8 Poverty Impact Assessment 63 16, 56\n9 List of Ineligible Items 67 17, 62\n10 Project Implementation Schedule 68 19, 69\n11 Contract Package List 69 19, 70\n12 Organogram of GEB 70 20, 76\n13 Financial Performance and Projections of GEB 71 21, 77\n14 Reorganization Plan for GEB 77 24, 86\n- Terms of Reference Consulting Services\n15 Consumer Awareness and Participation 81 26, 91\n- Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n16 Support to GERC 82 27, 95\n- Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n17 Financial Evaluation of the Project 84 29, 105\n18 Economic Evaluation of the Project 89 29, 108", "37\nAppendix 1\nKEY SECTOR INDICATORS\nA.

The  Government  of  Gujarat  has  been  encouraging  and  facilitatin.9  private  sector\nparticipation  in the field  of generation.  Transmission  and distribution  of power supply will also be\nconsidered  for  further  development  in a phased  manner  through  public-private  partnership  in\naccordance  with  the  Business  Plan  prepared  for  the  purpose  by GOG.  In support  of this,  the\nState's  approach  will be to foster  a transparent  and competitive  environment  which  will provide\na  level  playing  field  both  for  the  private  and  public  sectors  and  also  by  separating  sector\nregulation  from  operations.  The  legislative  basis  for  restructuring  and  regulating  the  State's\npower  sector  will  be  Gujarat  Electricity  Industry  (Reorganization  and  Regulation)  Bill,  2000\nwhich  is expected  to be enacted  soon.\nResidence.  1, Chief  Minister's  Bunglow,  Sector.20,  Gandhinagar-382  020\nTel.

Under  the  rn~  structure  of  the  power  sedor,  the  ~Ujarat  EIedricity  Regulatory\nCommissio~  (GERC)  a new  statutory,  independerrt  r:egulatcrj  authority  has been created  which\nwill be responsible  for:  .\n(a) setting  el~city  tariffs  and detem1ining  the corresponding  perfom1ance  nom1S;\n(b) collecting,  verifying  and disseminating  sedor  statistics;\n{c) coordinating  long term  power  planning;\n(d) creating  and  maintaining  a  non-discriminatory  and  commercial  business\nenvironment  in this sector;\n(e)  adjudicating  disputes  between  sector  entities;  and\n(f)  1icensing.\n6.  In the power  generation  segment  of the sector,  it is expected  that  in the long-term.  there\nwould  be several  generating  companies,  both  public  and private.  The  latter  could  be of various\ntypes  including:\n(a)  independent  power  producers;\n(b)  cooperative  generators;\n(c)  captive  generating  units selling  their surplus  energy  to the grid: and\n(d)  private  generating  and distribution  companies.\n7.  At present  Gujarat's  power  grid is beirJg maintained  by GEE. After  restructuring,  in order\nto facilitate  power  pooling  and  wheeling  between  suppliers  and  consumers,  the  State's  power\ngrid  will  be maintained  by GETCl,  which  will  be responsible  for  operation,  system  expansion\nand  maintenance  of proper  parameters  in the  grid- under the  supervision  of the regulator.  This\nentity will also be responsible  for the interconnections  wfth-other  power  systems  of the country.\n8.  With  regard  to  ~)ower distribution,  there  is already  a mix of private  and  public  entities...\nThere  is scope  for  involvement  of  private  initiative  through  various  public  private  ownership\nstructures  as also in.dicated in the para .~' above.\nC.

Gujarat  is a pioru~er State  in bringing  private  :sector in the field of generation.  rt has also\ntaken  lead in corporatizing  activities  of the  State  Electricity  Board  in the fired of generation  and\ntransmission  by setting  up GSEC  and GETCL  respelctively.  Gujarat  is committed  to strengthen\nfurther  corporatisation  and  encourage  involvement  of  private  sector  in  generation  and\ndistribution  in a phased  manner,  in line with  the model  of restructuring  developed  by GaG.  It is\nneedless  to  mention  th.at this  will  be  done  in  a transparent  and  competitive  manner.  It  is\nrecognized  that  to  pro'W'ide incentives  for  better  technical  performance,  there  has  to  be\ncompetition.  To enable  this, GEB has created  distribution  circles  at Kheda  and Rajkot  as -Profit\nCentres\"  which  will,  with  technical  and  financial  assistance  from  ADa,  establish  standards  of\nperformance  and serve  as role models  for other  distribution  entities.", "Appendix  2, page  4\n41\nD. Tariffs\n10.  Th.e Government  of Gujarat  reccIQnizes the fact. that there ~;  to be a tariff rationalization\nif  more  investments  are  to  be  forthcclming  in the  power  sedor.  IUtirrties should  operate  on\ncommercial  principles  and  earn  .adequcite  rates  of return  on capital  investments.  On the  other\nhand,  grant  of  unrestrained-  freedom  to fix  the  taiiff  by power  ub1ities wilr  lead  to  consumer\ninterest  being  adversely  affected.  Looking  to this Gujarat  has set up an independent  statutory\npower  tariff  and  reguratory  commissiorl.  While  the  Government  of Gujarat  recognizes.  on the\none hand, the need for the  continuance  of subsidized  tariff for agricul:b.Jraland  socially  obligatory\nactivities  like drinking  water  and  street  lighting  and lighting  for urban  and rural  poor, on the other\nhand,  it also recognizes  that  these  su~)idies  WI] have to be expficit,  quantified,  reasonable  and\ntargeted  and that.  while  cross-subsidiz:ition  cannot  be fulty enmi.nated.  it has to be kept  within\nreasonable  limits.  Thus.  in  the  finaJj~  .Gujarat  Bedricity  Industry  (R~anization  and\nRegulation)  BU1.2 000.  a ceiling  of 33%  ,of the cost to serve for each  category  of consumers  has\nbeen  fixed  as  the  maximum  limit  in ttle  year  2005  that  GERC  cctn permit  by way  of  cross-\nsubsiolZation  in  the  tariffs.  GERC  has  raised  the  effective  tariff  :for electricity  supply  to  the\nagriculture  sector  from  Rs.O.15  per Kwf'1 to Rs.0.80  per Kwh with effE!ct from  10ttl October,  2000.\nE. Cons.ervatjon  of Water  and ElttCtlicity\n11.  In the agriculture  sector,  the Go'l/emment  of Gujarat  recogni2:es that  the only sustainable\nsolution  lies in the optimal  use of resoul-ces,  both water  and electric~ty. It, therefore,  proposes  to\ntake  comprehensive  steps  to  induce  falrmers  to. adopt  energy  conservation  measures  such  as\ndrip irrigation.  A pilot  project  to enable  E~valuation of this strategy  is ilncluded  in the GPSDP.  The\nGPSDP  also  envisages  a  gradual  redlJction  in the  transmission  al'd  distribution  loss  through\nmetering  at aJllevels,  computerized  erJergy accounting,  and upgraljing  of distribution  systems\nwith  introduction  of modem  technology.,  An target  of less than  18 -t)ercent  loss,  as against  the\ncurrent  loss of over 20 percent,  has beE!n set for GEB to be achieve(]  over the next fc;u--c years.\nF. Conclusion\n12.  The  economy  of  the  State  of  Gujarat  has  been  experienc:ing  rapid  growth  in  all  the\nsectors.  Only a reliable  and  efficient  electricity  infrastructure  will pave the way  for the continued\nexpansion  of the  state's  economy  and, the  welfare  of its people.  lrhe  Government  of Gujarat\nonce  again  affirms  its  commib11ent  to  restructure  the  power  sec1:or along  commercial  lines.\nGiven  its vast experience  in the reforms  process  in the power  sectors  of its develop!ng  member\ncountries,  ADB  can  playa  major  role in assisting  Gujarat  in restructuring  the  sector.  On behalf\nof the Government  of Gujarat.

Part A: Transmission Systems Linked with the IPP Power Projects and\nfor System Improvement\n1. This project component has 220 kilovolts (kV) transmission lines and associated\nsubstation  bays  to evacuate  the output electric power  whose installed capacity  is\n750 megawatts (MW) in Gujarat. The associated IPP power projects in the western region of\nGujarat are indicated in Table A5.1.\nTable A5.1: Associated Power Projects\nProject Name  Installed Capacity District Name Status\n       as of October 2000\nReliance 2x250 MW Jamnagar PPA is signed.\nAkrimota 2x125 MW Kutch PPA is under preparation.\nMW = megawatts, PPA = power purchase agreement\n2. The total length of the 220 kV transmission lines will be about 866 circuit-kilometer\n(cct-km). The total additional number of 220 kV substation bays will be eight bays. These\ntransmission  systems  will  connect  new  IPP  power  plants  to  the  existing  220  kV  bulk\ntransmission systems of Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB). The output electric power will be\ndelivered to all GEB distribution circles. The IPP power projects will be fostered and secured\nby  the  installation  of  these  transmission  systems.  This  component  will  be  physically\ncompleted in June 2004.\n3. The project components also have transmission systems to improve power system\nstability, attaining loss reduction and to meet load growth. Materials and equipment will be by\nbulk purchase in conjunction with those in Part B. The total augmentation is indicated in\nTable A5.2.\nTable A5.2: Total Additional Transmission Systems\n                   Description        Quantity\n220/66 kV Substations 2,700 MVA\n220 kV Transmission Lines    240 cct-km\n66/11 kV Substations 2,815 MVA\n66 kV Sub-transmission Lines    629 cct-km\ncct-km = circuit kilometer, kV = kilovolt, MVA = mega volt-ampere\nB. Part B: Transmission Systems Associated with Profit Centers\n4. Three districts (distribution circles) are selected as independent profit centers in GEB,\nwhich will be given management autonomy in accounting, personnel, and procurement of\nmaterials. The annual load growth of the three districts is expected to be about 8 percent\nduring  the  next  four  years.  Transmission  systems  between  the  bulk  system  and  the\ndistribution systems of the three districts should be augmented to meet this load growth.  The\ntotal augmentation is in Table A5.3.", "54\nAppendix 5, page 2\nTable A5.3 Augmentation of Transmission Systems\n                     Description        Quantity\n400/220 kV Substations 630 MVA\n400 kV Transmission Line 80 cct-km\n220/66 kV Substations 200 MVA\n66/11 kV Substations 595 MVA\n66 kV Subtransmission Lines 208 cct-km\ncct-km = circuit kilometer, kV = kilovolt, MVA = mega volt-ampere\nC. Part C: Modernization and Upgrading of Distribution System\n5. This project component will support the independent profit centers to be established\nin Kheda (Anand) and Rajkot distribution circles as well as Mahesana distribution circle\nwhere a pilot system of drip irrigation system will be installed. Power systems from 220 kV\ntransmission systems to 0.4 kV distribution lines including meters will be modernized and\nupgraded under the comprehensive investment of GEB. Mobility, logistics, engineering, and\nadministration will also be modernized by providing computer systems, office equipment,\ncommunications equipment and system, and tools and tackles. Operation of the two profit\ncenters will be strengthened by this modernization and upgrading of the power system along\nwith the establishment of autonomous and commercial management in the profit centers\nunder the Asian Development Bank\u2019s TA and training offered by other bilateral aid agencies.\n6. This  project  component  also  comprises  of  (i)  replacement  of  burnt  and  failed\ndistribution transformers for five distribution circles (Palanpur, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Bhuj,\nSurendranagar), and (ii) replacement of conventional energy meters by high-quality static\nmeters on 500,000 installations for 12 distribution circles. These replacements are expected\nto attain (i) the increase in utilization factor from 0.90 to 0.95, and (ii) the accurate billing and\nincrease in revenue. In addition, the Vapi industrial area in Valsad distribution circle is\nselected as the pilot project for remote reading of 100 high tension (HT) consumers. The total\ntentative investment for this project component is indicated in Table A5.4.\nTable A5.4: Estimated Total Investment for Component C\n                     Description        Quantity \n11 kV Distribution Lines   4,380 cct-km\n11/0.4 kV Distribution Transformers 11,300 cct-km\n0.4 kV Distribution Lines   2,800 cct-km\nConventional Meters   630,000\nHigh-Tension High-Precision Meters 400\nLow-Tension High-Precision Meters 2,560\n11 kV Feeder Shunt Capacitor 42.5 MVA\ncct-km = circuit kilometer, kV = kilovolt, MVA = mega volt-ampere\nD.

In northern districts including Mahesana, farmers tend to use\nirrigation pumps to get as much groundwater as possible.  This is because farmers can gain\nshort-term benefits from higher cropping yields by growing water-intensive cash crops.  As a", "55\nAppendix 5, page 3\nresult, the groundwater level has dropped from about 10 meters below ground in the 1970s\nto an average of 150 meters today. This water level drop is still continuing and will result in\nsaline water. This lower water level also leads to more electricity consumption. In Gujarat,\nthis  chain  reaction  is  already  recognized  and  several  institutes  in  the  state  made\ncomprehensive  studies.  As  a  result,  modern  irrigation  methods  for  dry  weather  were\nproposed and small-scale pilot plants were implemented. However, these pilot schemes\nwere not large enough to show their positive impact on both water level and electricity\nconsumption. Therefore, a pilot study covering several villages is proposed to demonstrate\nthe potential impact of the modern irrigation method and cropping arrangements. Based on\nan assessment of the soil conditions and cropping pattern in Mahesana district and a review\nof  the  power  consumption  due  to  the  current  irrigation  methods,  alternative  economic\nirrigation methods such as drip irrigation will be proposed and a pilot project for about 18,000\nacres (360 wells, 3,600 farmers) will be conducted.", "56\nAppendix 6, page 1\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\nPart A : Transmission Systems Associated with IPP Power Projects\nand for System Improvement\n$1.00=Rs46.50\nForeign Local Cost Total Cost\nProject Component Exchange $ million ($ million)\n($ million) Rs million equivalent\nA-1 Reliance Power Project (2x250MW)\n1. 220kV D/C Motikhavadi-Motipanoli                2.83              59.35                1.28                4.11\n   (68km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Motipanoli) \n2. 220kV D/C Motikhavadi-Rajkot                5.21            102.51                2.20                7.41\n   (130km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Rajkot)\nSubtotal                8.04            161.86                3.48              11.52\nA-2 Akrimota Power Project (2x125MW)\n1. 220kV D/C Akrimota-Nakhatrana                3.88              77.78                1.67                5.55\n   (95km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Nakhatrana)\n2. 220kV D/C Nakhatrana-Chitrod                5.83            120.94                2.60                8.43\n   (140km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Both Ends)\nSubtotal                9.71            198.72                4.27              13.98\nA-Addl.

Introduction\n1. Transmission  line  projects  are  exempted  from  environmental  examination  by  the\nGovernment of India (the Government) and require only a No Objection Certificate from the\nDepartment of Forests. The project passes through mostly desert wasteland and grazing land.\nAs  such,  the  Department  of  Forest  has  issued  a  No  Objection  Certificate.  However,\ntransmission line projects are classified in category B under the Asian Development Bank's\n(ADB\u2019s) classification of environmental impacts. Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) has prepared\nan initial environmental examination (IEE) using the overlay technique. Not all the sites for new\nsubstations have been identified, and for purposes of IEE analysis a typical site is used. GEB\nwill submit a report on the substation sites once those are identified and submit to ADB a\nchecklist of the expected environmental impacts and mitigating measures in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Industrial and Power Development Projects.\nHowever, given the nature of the area and that many of these substations are within existing\nfacilities of GEB, it is expected that the environmental impact will be minor.\nB. Project Description\n2. A description of the Project is given in para. 47 of the main RRP report and Appendix 5.\nC. Description of the Environment\n3. Gujarat is located in the western part of India. Deserts characterize the western and\nnorthwest sections of the state. Mudflats and mangrove swamps are the dominant features\nalong the coastline of the Arabian Sea. There is no major river system west of Ahmadabad\nbecause of the extremely low rainfall. The southeast and eastern sections are affected by the\nsouthwest monsoon from July to October. A number of major river systems in northern and\ncentral India pass through the state before discharging to the Arabian Sea. The major river\nsystems are located in the southeastern part of the state. The major river systems are Narmada,\nTapi, Mahi, and Sabarmati. All empty into the Gulf of Khambhat. Except for the mountains in the\neastern and southeastern boundaries, the southeast section of Gujarat is relatively flat plain.\n4. Most of the population live in the central and eastern sections of the state. In the eastern\nsection, which is affected by the monsoon or where irrigation water is available, a wide variety of\ncash crops are grown. Wheat, rice, sugarcane, and sorghum are cultivated. In recent years,\nhigher value crops such as banana, vegetables and other fruit are cultivated for export and the\ndomestic market. In areas with less rainfall, peanuts and pulses are cultivated. The semiarid\nsections  are  normally  used  for  grazing  and  are  sparsely  populated.  The  western  and\nnorthwestern sections are mostly the salt desert of the Rann of Kachchh.\n1. Akrimota-Nakhatrana-Chitrod Area\n5. The southwest coastline of Gujarat is lined with mangrove swamps stretching to the\nPakistan border. The swamp width varies from few a meters at Kandla port to a few hundred\nmeters close to the Pakistani border. Behind the mangrove swamps, the area is dotted with\nmudflats that extend up to 20 kilometers (km) inland during the summer months. The area is\narid and during the summer months is bare except for a few acacia trees. During the monsoon\nseason, the area  is covered  with grass  and used  primarily for grazing.  Groundnuts and  other", "61\nAppendix 7, page 2\ncrops tolerant of drought are cultivated during the monsoon months. Due to the low agricultural\nproductivity of the area, the population density is very low.\n6. In recent years with the development of port facilities along the coastline, a number of\nheavy  industries  have  established  in  the  area  especially  around  Kandla  port.  The  heavy\nindustries have stimulated the growth of medium-scale industries serving primarily the export\nmarket and the needs of the oil industry. Due to its proximity to the Gulf states, the port along\nthe coastline is the main entry point for oil and other hydrocarbons. The area is crossed by gas\nand oil pipelines serving the heavily populated northern states including the capital, Delhi. A\nnumber of power plants have been built in the area talking advantage of the vast tract of open\nspace, proximity to fuel supply, and large industrial users.\n2. Motikhavadi-Motipanoli/Motikhavadi-Rajkot/Rajkot-Morbi Area\n7. The area is part of the semiarid western section of the peninsula surrounded by the Gulf\nof Kachchh, the Arabian Sea, and the Gulf of Khambhat. Jamnagar on the coast of the Gulf of\nKachchh is the major town and the traditional port before the development of Kandla. Unlike the\nfishing, port, and industrial areas along the coastline, the interior is thinly populated. The main\noccupation of the people is herding goats and sheep. Rajkot is the major trading town in the\ninterior being at the crossroads of the highway from Porbandar to Delhi and the highway\nconnecting to Kandla. With to the development of new industries in Kandla, Jamnagar, and the\ncoastal areas, and availability of vast tracts of wastelands, a number of independent power\nproducers are locating in the area. There is no major river system in the area because of low\nrainfall. The main tree species - acacia and eucalyptus - are sparsely distributed along dry\nriverbeds and depressed areas that hold some water during the short rainy season.\n3. Bardoli-Chikhali Area\n8. The 40-km line is located in the southeastern section of Gujarat running parallel to the\neastern coast of the Gulf of Khambhat. The soil in the area is primarily fertile alluvial deposit\nfrom the four major rivers passing through Gujarat. The area has flat rolling hills planted with\nsugarcane, wheat, and rice. During the dry season peanut is planted. The area is located along\nthe major transport road connecting Delhi and Mumbai. A number of heavy industries are\nscattered in the area and, in recent years the newer industries have settled in industrial estates.\nThe industries produce mostly chemicals such as dyes, agrochemicals, and various types of\nplastic resins. There are also a number of manufacturers of textiles and consumer products.\n4. Substations\n9. The substations are located in various towns along the transmission line routes. The 220\nkV transmission lines will not pass through built-up areas, since 66 kV lines connect substations\nto the service areas. Fifty-five substations will be expanded. The expansion will be carried out\nwithin existing substation facilities and will not require any land acquisition. Sixty-five new\nsubstations will be built each requiring 1-5 hectares (ha). The exception is the 440 kV substation\nin Rajkot, which will require 33.4 ha. Fifteen new substation sites have been identified mostly on\nwasteland owned by the State Government. Two substation sites in Chitrod will be acquired\nfrom private land owners, one in Jakhwada and another one in Sundarphur. The two substation\nsites  will  have  an  area  of  5  ha  each.  The  private  lands  are  primarily  grazing  land.  No\nresettlement is involved.", "62\nAppendix 7, page 3\nD.  Screening of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n10. The transmission system route was selected to avoid the mangrove swamps and will\npass through the mudflats. The transmission towers and conductors will be a prominent feature\nin the area. This is a residual impact of the project. However, there is no important landmark\nwhose aesthetics could be affected by the project. For safety purposes, the foundation of the\ntransmission towers are built away from dry river beds that normally overflow during flash floods\nthat  infrequently  occur  in  the  semiarid  areas.  The  transmission  towers  will  not  have  any\nsignificant impact on the river flows.\n11. Rehabilitation of old substations along the distribution network may involve the collection\nand disposal of PCB materials in old transformers and other substation equipment. The extent\nof PCB to be collected and disposed of has not been determined. The GEB consultant will\ndetermine the extent of PCB  used in those materials. If PCB is present, it will be collected in\nairtight containers and stored in a secured area within one of the GEB power plants until a\nsuitable incinerator is available in India. Temporary storage of PCB in airtight containers is an\naccepted practice even in developed countries that do not have high temperature incineration\nfacilities.\nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n12. The upgrading will most likely require the appointment of a senior official to head the\nenvironment and safety unit at the main office. The head of the unit will report directly to the\nmanaging director in line with current practices adapted worldwide. Although the Project does\nnot  require  any  environmental  impact  assessment  under  the  existing  regulations  of  the\nGovernment  of  India,  during  construction  the  project  management  office  will  continuously\nmonitor the rehabilitation of the substation to ensure conformity with acceptable standards,\nespecially if PCBs are identified.\nF. Findings and Conclusion\n13. The Project components will pass through desert and semiarid areas in the north and\nnorthwest sections of Gujarat State. They will not dislocate any agricultural activity nor will they\npass  through  any  built-up  areas.  One  section  of  the  transmission  line  passes  through\nagricultural land. The impact of the Project during construction is limited as the area is cultivated\nwith groundnuts, wheat, and sugarcane. The area under the transmission line could continue to\nbe used for those agricultural activities.\n14. The land acquired for the new substations are mostly wasteland outside towns and\nindustrial zones developed near the port facilities.\n15.

Introduction\n1. To improve operational efficiencies in its electricity sector and make it financially viable and\nself-sustaining, as well as to improve the delivery of electric power to the citizens of Gujarat, the\nGovernment of Gujarat (the State Government) has embarked on a plan to restructure and reform\nthe sector over the next five years. During the reform process, several major changes will be made\nin the structure of the sector, its governance, the tariff structure, and the customer orientation of its\nemployees.\n2. The major utility involved in the delivery of electricity to consumers is the Gujarat Electricity\nBoard (GEB), an autonomous entity of the State Government, established under the Electricity\n(Supply) Act of 1948. GEB is a vertically integrated monopoly serving consumers in all areas of\nGujarat, other than Ahmedabad and Surat cities, which are served by the Ahmedabad Electric\nCompany Limited and the Surat Electric Company Limited. Both are private sector licensees, which\nare also vertically integrated monopolies in their respective distribution territories. Over the years,\nGEB policies and procedures have fallen behind the times and, coupled with an nonviable tariff\nand subsidy policy, have driven the organization into near financial ruin. Morale of GEB staff and\nthe quality of service consumers have also fallen. Consequently, a central part of the reforms lies\nin reorganizing GEB.\n3. GEB has commenced reorganizing by establishing the Gujarat State Electricity Company\nLimited  (GSECL),  which  will  be  an  independent  power  producer  owning  and  operating  its\nGandhinagar and Utran power stations, and the Gujarat Energy Transmission Company Limited\n(GETCL), which will be responsible for owning and operating the transmission network of GEB.\nBoth GSECL and GETCL have been incorporated under the Companies\u2019 Act, which provides more\nflexibility regarding their shareholding, staff, and decision making. It is expected that in due course,\nmore generating units of GEB would be similarly entrusted to GSECL or to another company.\nHowever, reorganizing the distribution segment is more critical, since it is the one that incur the\nmost  losses,  is  poorly  organized,  and  is  the  primary  cause  of  dissatisfaction  among  GEB\u2019s\nconsumers.\n4. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the State Government in the reforms being\nundertaken,  by  providing  of  (i)  policy  advice,  (ii)  technical  assistance  grants  for  studies  and\nconsultations to prepare and implement the reforms, (iii) funds to cover part of the costs of\nadjustment during the reforms; and (iv) investments in the sector. ADB has agreed to provide\ntechnical  assistance  to  assist  the  State  Government  and  GEB  over  the  next  18  months  to\nformulate and implement a reorganizing strategy for GEB, focusing on its distribution business.\nB. Scope\n5. In  consultation  with  the  State  Government  and  GEB  and  after  discussing  alternative\nmodels, the consultants will, (i) prepare an overall strategy for reforming of the distribution sector,\n(ii) segregate the assets and liabilities of the identified distribution areas, (iii) establish the imputed\ntariffs in each distribution area based on a range of consumer mix and generation scenarios, and\n(iv)  develop  a  mechanism  for  addressing  subsides  within  and  across  distribution  areas.  The\nsuitability of each model will be judged against the criteria that will include (i) efficiency of delivery,\n(ii) maximizing the benefits of competition, (iii) least cost to the consumers, and (iv) maximizing\ncontribution to sustainable public finances by lowering  subsidies and limiting  cross-subsidies. The", "78\nAppendix 14, page 2\nconsultant will also examine matters relating to (i) rationalization of GEB\u2019s personnel, (ii) unfunded\nliabilities of GEB, and (iii) costs of adjustments.\n6. After the model under the reorganization plan has been developed and the necessary\nstudies completed, the Consultant will, if studies show the feasibility and practicability of privatizing\na distribution area, (i) prepare documents necessary for solicitation of private sector participation in\none distribution entity, and (ii) help in evaluating the offers received. Privatization  will be done in\nan open, competitive, and transparent manner.\n1. International Consultants\na.  Corporate Reorganizing Policy Expert/ Team Leader\n(4 person-months)\n7.

Introduction\n1. To improve operational efficiencies in its electricity sector to make it financially viable\nand self-sustaining, and to improve the delivery of electric power to the citizens of Gujarat, the\nGovernment of Gujarat (the State Government) has embarked on a plan to restructure and\nreform the sector over the next five years. During this reform process, several major changes\nwill be made in the structure of the sector, its governance, the tariff structure, and the customer\norientation of its employees. These changes may temporarily put pressure on some of the\nsector\u2019s  stakeholders,  who  may  perceive  some  of  the  changes  as  being  inimical  to  their\ninterests. The State Government believes that the anxiety of the affected groups and their\ntendency  to  oppose  the  reform  process  will  greatly  diminish  if  all  stakeholder  groups  are\nregularly consulted during the reform process, and are able to contribute to it in terms of ideas,\nin disseminating information and in providing feedback as to its success. There is also a greater\npurpose in initiating this consultative process at this time, since the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory\nCommission (GERC) has been constituted and will, over the next year, formulate the long-term\nvision for  tariff setting and regulation for the sector.\n2. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the State Government in the reforms\nbeing undertaken, through provision of (i) policy advice, (ii) technical assistance grants for\nstudies and consultations to prepare and implement the reforms, (iii) funds to cover part of the\ncosts of adjustment during the reforms, and (iv) investments in the sector. To improve the\nconsultative and participatory processes for the reform process, ADB acting on a request from\nthe  State  Government,  agreed  to  provide  technical  assistance  to  enable  Nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  representing  the  major  consumer  groups  in  Gujarat,  to  form  a\nconsultative forum called the Electricity Consumers\u2019 Consultative Forum (ECCF) of Gujarat.\n3.  Three consumer categories represent a majority of the electricity consumers in Gujarat:\n(i) residential consumers who are largely represented by the Consumer Education and Research\nCentre (CERC); (ii) agriculture consumers who are largely represented by the Bharatiya Kisan\nSangh (Indian Farmers' Union-BKS); and (iii) industrial consumers that are represented by the\nConfederation  of  Indian  Industry\u2013Gujarat  Chapter  (CII).  When  the  reform  program  was  first\ndiscussed in 1996 with the State Government, the preparatory TAs funded by ADB did include\nconsultations and workshops with these stakeholders. These organizations also represented the\nconsumer groups in the public hearings organized by GERC over the past one year.\nB. Terms of Reference\n4.  The TA will fund\n(i)  four consumer information workshops in different parts of Gujarat over one year;\n(ii)  travel, stay costs, and honorarium fees of domestic experts, so that they can\nprovide inputs to the working of the ECCF; and\n(iii) preparation  of  information  materials  to  further  disseminate  information  to  the\nconstituents of the ECCF.", "82\nAppendix 16, page 1\nSUPPORT TO GUJARAT ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\nA.  Introduction\n1. To improve operational efficiencies in its electricity sector and make it financially viable\nand self-sustaining, as well as to improve the delivery of electric power to the citizens of the State\nof Gujarat in India, the Government of Gujarat (the State Government) embarked a plan to\nrestructure and reform the sector over the next five years. During the reform process, several\nmajor changes will be made in the structure of the sector, its governance, the tariff structure, and\nthe  customer  orientation  of  its  employees.  As  part  of  this  reform,  the  Gujarat  Electricity\nRegulatory Commission (GERC) was established in 1998 and mandated to discharge a large\nspectrum of functions including determining tariffs and corresponding performance norms, issuing\nlicenses and ensuring a nondiscriminatory and commercial business environment. GERC, which\nwas established under the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998 of the Indian Parliament,\nwill be formalized under the Gujarat Electricity Industry (Reorganization and Regulation) Bill, 2000\n(the Act), which is expected to be enacted in 2001. GERC currently consists of a chairman,\n2 members and 24 supporting and auxiliary staff. The small size of its permanent staff reflects the\nintention of the State Government to maximize the use of outside consultants for specific tasks\ninstead of keeping all technical expertise required as part of the permanent workforce.\n2. The Act requires the framing of regulations related to the general conduct of GERC\u2019s affair\nand its discharge of functions, to enable GERC to function in a transparent manner. Further,\nGERC desires to it frame and adopt long-term tariff and regulatory policies that will provide a\nstable tariff and regulatory regime conducive to the proper growth and development of the sector.\n3. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the State Government in the reforms, by\nproviding of (i) policy advice, (ii) technical assistance grants for studies and consultations to\nprepare and implement the reforms, (iii) funds to cover part of the costs of adjustment during the\nreforms, and (iv) investments in the sector. ADB has agreed to provide technical assistance to\nsupport GERC over the next 18 months to (i) help draft a tariff and regulatory policy valid for the\nnext five years; (ii) help adapt the draft regulations in force in other states of India and abroad, to\nmake them applicable to Gujarat; (iii) provide expert advice to interpret the regulations and tariff\npolicies; and (iv) train key GERC staff in administering the regulations.\nB.  Scope of Work\n1. Preparation of Regulations and Codes\n4. The consultants will review the regulations in force in other states in India and abroad and\nadapt such regulations for application by GERC. If appropriate regulations do not exist, new ones\nwill be prepared. Each regulation will be drafted and submitted in five hard copies to GERC and\none copy to ADB, and in a MSWord 2000 electronic format to both. After comments are received\nand incorporated, the final versions will be submitted in five hard copies to GERC and one copy\nto ADB, with MSWord 2000 electronic versions to both. The regulations will cover the following\nareas:\n(i)  Structure and modalities of regulatory control. These regulations include rules,\ntechnical, legal and price regulations, licenses and operational codes as listed\nbelow:", "83\nAppendix 16, page 2\n(a)  grid and distribution code,\n(b)  metering,\n(c)  interconnection,\n(d)  sharing of assets and common facilities,\n(e) standards of performance (including customer service standards),\n(f) supply regulations,\n(g) supply regulations,\n(h) access to facilities,\n(i) class exemptions from Licensing, etc.,\n(j) planning standards;\n(k)  competitive procurement; and\n(l)  demand side management.\n(ii)  Business conduct regulations. These regulations relate to the procedures of GERC\nwith reference to the sector entities and processes, and covers specific matters\nsuch as\n(a) license application,\n(b) power procurement process,\n(c) price regulation,\n(d) revenue and tariff determination and fixation,\n(e) captive generating units,\n(f) fees, fines and charges, and\n(g) dispute resolution.\n(iii)  Internal regulations of GERC. These regulations pertain to the internal working of\nthe GERC and cover\n  (a) appointment of chairman and members,\n(b) appointment of staff and consultants,\n(c) HRD issues and organizational structure,\n(d)  conditions of service of staff, and\n(e)  functions and procedures of GERC.\n2.  Training and Operational Support to GERC\n5. The consultant will organize a human development exercise for GERC staff as follows:\n(i)  External training for selected officers and staff.  Within the budget indicated in the\nTA, the consultant will prepare and implement a training program for key officers\nand  employees  of  GERC,  including  (a)  in-house  training  and  workshops  in\nunderstanding and application of the new regulations at Ahmedabad (this will\ninclude staff from other power sector entities); and (b) visits by GERC senior staff\nGERC to attend international seminars and conferences.\n(ii) Analytical and operational support in interpreting regulations and codes. For one\nyear after the new regulations are approved and published, the consultants will\nassist  GERC  in  interpreting  and  operationalizing  them.  This  would  include\n(a) providing  of  reference  cases  pertaining  to  application  of  the  regulations;\n(b) suggesting for modifications of the regulations considering experience gained\nin their application.

The financial evaluation of the Project was carried out on an incremental basis and also\non a subproject basis due to its discrete nature. Income tax is not considered since the Gujarat\nElectricity  Board  (GEB)  is  exempted  from  income  tax  payment.  All  prices  are  in  constant\nOctober 2000 value. Foreign exchange rate is assumed at Rs46.50 to $1.00.\n3. The capital cost of each subproject and its disbursement schedule were reviewed by the\nMission. Physical contingency is provided at 10 percent of the base cost.\n4. GEB\u2019s cost of capital is calculated for the Project as a whole. The Project will be\nfinanced by foreign debt (60 percent) and local debt. The cost of debt for the Project in Rupees\nis 12 percent and 15 percent, respectively, for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan and\ncommercial loan. The weighted average cost of capital is estimated in real terms and shown in\nTable A17.1.\nTable A17.1:  Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\nSource Amount Cost (%) Weighted Cost (%)\n(Rs million)\nAsian Development Bank Debt 9,300 5.16 3.27 3.30\nDomestic Commercial Debt 5,166 7.98 2.95 2.90\nWACC 6.22 6.20\nB. Project Parts A, B, and C: Transmission and Distribution\n1. Capital Cost\n5. It is assumed that the Project will commence operation in two years and reach full\ncapacity in four years after the start of construction. The operating life of the Project is 20 years\nwith  no  salvage  value.  The  total  cost  amounting  to  Rs13,764  million  is  scheduled  to  be\ndisbursed as presented in Table A17.2.\nTable A17.2: Disbursement Schedule\n(Rs million)\nItem FY2002 FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005\nDisbursement 2,753 4,129 4,129 2,753", "85\nAppendix 17, page 2\n2. Sales Revenues\na. Tariff\n6. It is assumed that of the total incremental power sales realized under the Project, power\nsales corresponding to 18,740 million kWh would be at the distribution level with overall average\nretail tariff for GEB.\nb. Sales Volume\n7. The transmission system financed by the Project is utilized to evacuate power from two\nnew independent power producer's (IPPs) and, through the establishment of new substations\nGEB has an estimated additional 18,740 million kWh to provide to its customers. The annual\npower purchase volume is estimated at 2,292 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in FY2004, 6,125 GWh in\nFY2005, and 18,740 GWh in FY2006 onward.\n3. Operating Cost\na. Variable Cost\n8. The weighted average of self-generation costs and power purchase prices from IPPs is\nused as variable cost for the Project.\nb. Fixed Cost\n9. Fixed  cost  comprises  only  operation  and  maintenance  cost,  which  is  estimated  at\n2.5 percent of capital investments.\nC. Project Part D: Pilot Project for Energy and Water Conservation \u2013 Drip Irrigation\n1. Capital Cost\n10. It is assumed that the Project will commence operation at the end of three years and\nreach full operation at the end of four years. The operating life of the Project is 10 years with no\nsalvage value. The total cost amounting to Rs660 million is scheduled to be disbursed as\npresented in Table A17.3.\nTable A17.3: Disbursement Schedule\n(Rs million)\nItem FY2002 FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005\nDisbursement 132 198 198 132\n2. Number of Wells To Be Converted\n11. The cost of converting the irrigation system associated with each well is estimated at\nRs1.35 million based on the pilot survey. Of this total cost, 25 percent will be borne by GEB, and\nthe rest will be paid by the Government as subsidy. The total number of wells to be converted\nunder the Project is 1,289.", "86\nAppendix 17, page 3\n3. Sales Revenues\n12. It is assumed that the energy saved by converting the irrigation system can be sold to\nend users at an expected overall average retail tariff. Please note that this is an incremental\nanalysis using the same pump. Therefore, the costs are identical, with no additional fixed or\nvariable operating costs.\na.  Expected Overall Average Retail Tariff\n13. The values are assumed to remain constant beyond FY2010.\nTable A17.4:  Average Retail Tariffs\n(Rs per kWh)\nFY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010\nAverage Retail Tariff 2.89 2.93 2.93 2.93 2.93 2.94\nb. Energy Savings\n14. Each well uses a 40 HP motor pump. It is assumed that the pump runs for nine months\nof the year for six hours a day under the current flood irrigation. After conversion, each pump\nneeds to run for nine months of the year for one hour a day. Therefore, total energy saved by\nthe conversion is projected to be 52 GWh annually.\n15.

As part of its private power generation policy, the State Government invited private\nsector investment to increase generation capacity in Gujarat. Proposals have been solicited for\nabout 4,400 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity on a build-own-operate basis. A number of\npower purchasing agreements have been signed, among which are those for the Reliance and\nAkrimota independent power producers (IPPs) with a combined capacity of 750 MW. To allow\nevacuation of power from the new plants, complementary investments in transmission and\ndistribution facilities are required. Component A of the Project includes the construction of\ndedicated transmission facilities for the two IPPs, while components B and C are dedicated to\noverall system upgrading. The system strengthening investments will indirectly also benefit the\nevacuation from the IPPs in addition to saving losses and utilizing surplus capacity available at\nother state and central power stations. Therefore, the transmission components were evaluated\ntogether with the proposed IPP plants they will serve, and also together with the distribution\ncomponents of the project investments.\nA.  Capital Cost\n2. The economic capital cost of project components A, B, and C were estimated on the\nbasis of the financial costs, with appropriate adjustments made to reflect the true resource\n(economic)  costs  of  the  different  components.  The  estimated  capital  costs  for  the  project\ncomponent were broken down into direct foreign exchange items, indirect foreign exchange\nitems, local goods and services and skilled and unskilled labor for purposes of the economic\nanalysis. All elements were valued at border prices with all taxes and duties excluded. No price\ncontingencies  are  included  in  the  base  capital  cost.  However,  the  economic  capital  costs\ninclude 10 percent physical contingencies. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 has been applied\nto all non-tradable items and a shadow wage rate of 0.85 was used for unskilled labor.\n3. Annual operation and maintenance cost were also calculated in economic prices as a\npercentage of the total capital investment cost. All prices are in constant October 2000 values.\nThe  cost  of  energy  at  generation  level  was  valued  at  the  IPP  take-off  prices  for  project\ncomponent  A,  separately  for  each  IPP,  and  at  GEB\u2019s  power  purchase  pool  price  for  the\nadditional  units  resulting  from  project  components  B  and  C.  Transmission  and  distribution\nlosses of 20 percent were deducted from the IPP send-out volume, but the full send-out volume\nwas priced in the cost of energy.\nB.  Benefits\n4. Economic benefits of electricity consumption were calculated for all major consumer\ncategories. For nonincremental consumption they were based on the alternative economic costs\nof other energy sources such as diesel generators and kerosene lamps that will be replaced by\nusing electricity. For incremental electricity consumption, the benefits were estimated by valuing\nadditional or induced energy consumption at the estimated willingness to pay.\n5. A balance between power demand and supply was recently achieved in Gujarat State,\nand  therefore  nonincremental  consumption  was  assumed  to  be  marginal  for  all  consumer\ngroups.  The shares of electricity supply assumed to replace an alternative energy source were\nthus 10 percent for domestic, commercial and low tension (LT) industry, and seven percent for", "90\nAppendix 18, page 2\nagriculture.  The  latter  value  is  based  on  a  7  percent  ownership  of  diesel  pumps  among\nagricultural users identified in an Asian Development Bank (ADB) study.1 GEB tariff for high\ntension (HT) consumers is currently equal to or higher than the equivalent unit costs for different\ntypes of captive generation except for captive units running on naphtha. Approximately 23\npercent of captive units are operated with naphtha and this percentage was used as the\nreplacement share for HT consumers. The economic benefit of fuel substitution is the resulting\neconomic resource cost saving that is, the economic cost of alternative energy that the country\nsaves by using electricity.\n6. Induced consumption was valued by estimating the consumer\u2019s willingness to pay for\nthis part of incremental electricity supply and adding the related consumer surplus benefits to\nthe tariff-based revenues. Given the sensitivity of demand to price for the various categories of\nconsumers, only a portion of the maximum consumer\u2019s surplus benefits was assumed for the\nvaluation of induced sales.\n7. The ADB study found that all HT industries own at least one captive generation unit\neach, varying in size from 160 kilowatt (kW) diesel generators to 50 megawatt (MW) gas plants.\nCaptive power production is on average cheaper than power supplied from the grid especially\nso for co-generating plants. This is mainly due to high cross-subsidization and the electricity\nduty that is levied on the grid tariff, but which does not have to be paid in full for captive\nproduction. Changes to the tariff structure and the electricity duty (ED) are addressed under the\nProgram and are expected to have a gradual positive impact on HT share of consumption\nstarting in FY2001/02. For the economic evaluation a conservative approach was chosen and\nHT consumers were valued at only 23 percent of the HT consumption share for the benefit\ncalculation.  No  induced  consumption  was  assumed  for  the  remaining  77  percent  as  their\nwillingness to pay is limited by the cost of self-generation which, for a 160 kw diesel generator is\ncurrently Rs per kWh 4.15 compared with a total financial price of Rs per kWh 5.25. While it is\nexpected that grid supply for HT consumers will become much more attractive in the medium\nterm as a result of the policy changes, a cautious approach was considered appropriate to in\nvaluing benefits to HT consumers. The remaining 77 percent share of HT was distributed\nproportionally over the LT, commercial, and domestic user categories.\n8. Alternative sources of power used by the LT industry, commercial, domestic, and\nagricultural users were determined and their respective costs were estimated. It was found that\nthe dominant source of alternative power in the rural domestic sector is kerosene lamps. In case\nof urban domestic consumers, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) lights (\u201cPetromax\u201d) are used more\nfrequently than kerosene lamps. Further, ownership of generators increases rapidly with the rise\nin household income - all households having an income of more than Rs40,000 a month (in\ncurrent 1997 prices) reported ownership of a small diesel generator. Even among lower middle-\nincome households, with income of Rs5,000-Rs15,000, eight percent own a small kerosene\ngenerator. Roughly around 40 percent of total end consumption in the domestic sector is used\nfor lighting purposes. In the rural areas these numbers are considerably higher due to\nsignificantly lower ownership of electrical appliances. Therefore, economic benefits for the\ndomestic sector were calculated for only 40 percent of total incremental domestic consumption.\nThis 40 percent reflects ownership of a variety of alternative energy sources that have been\nvalued separately. The remaining 60 percent share of domestic consumption is 89\n                  \n1   TA No. 2739-IND: Development of a Framework for Electricity Tariffs in Gujarat, for $300,000 approved on\n17 December 1996. Data on the ownership of alternative energy sources used in this Appendix is based on the\nTA study.", "91\nAppendix 18, page 3\nconsidered indifferent as the consumers do not own alternative energy sources. This share was\nvalued at the average tariff for the residential category.\n9. The  40  percent  share  reflecting  ownership  of  alternative  energy  generation  was\nallocated over the four alternative energy sources. Given Gujarat\u2019s relative wealth, it can be\nassumed that 5 percent of domestic consumers own kerosene generators and 5 percent a\ndiesel generator set. Another 50 percent are assumed to own a Petromax, while the remaining\n40 percent rely on kerosene lamps and candles for alternative energy. Induced consumption\nwas valued using the willingness-to-pay method plus the related consumer surplus with a\ncurvature factor of 0.3.\n10. Commercial sector use of alternative sources of power also differs between urban and\nrural areas. While in the urban areas the commercial sector uses a mix of small diesel and\nkerosene  generators  and  Petromax,  in  the  rural  areas  kerosene  lamps  and  candles  are\ndominant. However, the large commercial sector segment shows user patterns more similar to\nsmall and medium-size industries. Typically, hotels, hospitals, office complexes, and universities\nwould be considered large commercial sector. Commercial sector consumers are defined as\nhaving a contractual  load below 25 kilovolt-amperes (kVA). The average economic cost of\nalternative energy sources for commercial establishments was estimated at Rs3.96 per kWh for\na 54 kW generator.\n11. LT industry consumers can also be divided into small and large users depending on the\ncontracted load. Small LT consumers are similar to large commercial consumers in terms of\nalternative energy sources. Among the LT consumer category, 46 percent of industries with a\ncontractual load between 25 and 100 kVA own diesel generators with an average capacity of 70\nkW. The estimated financial cost of production of these units was estimated at Rs.3.87, which\nwas used in the benefit calculation.\n12. Agricultural tariffs in Gujarat are historically very low and have shown little change over\nthe last 10 years. The low power tariffs have resulted in ownership of electric pumps by\n92.5 percent of households and an increase in agriculture's share of total GEB consumption to\n43 percent. Only 7.5 percent of households own diesel pump sets. Capital costs of diesel pump\nsets are on average considerably lower than those of an equivalent capacity electric pump set.\nHowever,  considering  the  larger  size  and  higher  utilization  of  electric  pump  sets  and  the\nconsiderably lower fuel costs, the average cost per kWh of output is lower for the electric pump\nset.  The  financial  cost  for  a  unit  produced  by  a  diesel  pump  set  is  estimated  at  Rs4.73\ncompared with Rs0.47 for an electric pump. Even at the increased agricultural tariff of Rs.0.58,\nwhich results in a total unit cost of Rs.0.9, diesel pumps are not competitive with electric pumps.\n13. With the projected increase of tariff for agriculture and the mandated metering of all\nconsumers, it is expected that agricultural consumption will decrease significantly in the future.\nTherefore, no induction benefits were calculated for the 92.5 percent share of households with\nelectric pumps. As for HT consumers, this volume was distributed over the LT, commercial, and\ndomestic consumer categories according to their share in total GEB consumption.\nC. Conclusion\n14. On the basis of a comparison of economic cost and benefits over a 20-year period, the\nproposed transmission and distribution component shows an economic internal rate of return\n(EIRR) of 25  percent.  This value comfortably exceeds  ADB's minimum cut off level for project", "92\nAppendix 18, page 4\nacceptability.  Comprehensive  sensitivity  testing  found  that  the  Project  is  robust  except  for\nchanges in the overall benefit stream. A four percent reduction of the overall benefit stream\nwould result in an EIRR of 12 percent. Based on that finding, the sensitivity to changes in each\nindividual benefit stream for the five consumer categories was tested. The analysis shows that\nthe EIRR is most sensitive to changes in benefits of the LT and domestic consumer categories,\nbut remains above the cut off rate of 12 percent for all tested situations except for a 20 percent\nreduction in domestic benefits. Further testing was done for the LT and domestic consumer\ncategories to determine how vulnerable the project is to changes in key parameters underlying\nthese two benefit flows.\n15. In the LT category the base case for induction and replacement proportion is 90:10. This\nproportion has been changed to 50:50 and 10:90, the most adverse scenario. However, in both\ncases the EIRR remains well above the cutoff rate. The sensitivity of the EIRR to changes in the\nLT benefit stream appears to be mainly the result of its high share (33 percent) in total benefits,\nwhich magnifies the impact of modest changes in the underlying benefit stream.\n16. The base case for induction and replacement proportions for the domestic category is\nthe same as for the LT category and the same sensitivity testing was done. In both cases the\nEIRR  increased  significantly.  This  was  expected  as  the  base  case  reflects  the  most\nconservative scenario. However, as a further test, the share of domestic consumers owning\nalternative energy sources (kerosene lamps, etc) as opposed to indifferent consumers not\nowning alternative energy sources was varied. The base case proportion was 40:60. If the\nproportion  is  assumed  to  be  equal,  then  the  EIRR  increases  by  nine  percentage  points.\nHowever, if the share changes to 30:70, the EIRR drops to 13 percent, displaying a sensitivity\nindicator of 9.15 percent. Given that Gujarat is the third richest Indian State in terms of state\ndomestic product per capita, a 40 percent ownership of alternative energy sources appears to\nbe a realistic assumption, particularly as four categories of captive energy were considered. As\nin the case of LT consumers, the sensitivity of the EIRR to changes in the domestic benefit\nstream appears to be driven by its high share  (48 percent) in total benefits. It should be recalled\nthat these high shares are the result of the distribution of 78 percent of HT and of 92.5 percent\nof agriculture consumption over the remaining three consumer categories that were included in\nthe  benefit  calculation.  Public  lighting,  railways,  public  waterworks  and  bulk  supply,  which\naccount for 11.2 percent of total consumption, were excluded from the benefit calculation.\n17. To account for the sensitivity to changes in fuel cost, a switching value test was carried\nout. The test showed that for an 8 percent increase in total fuel cost, the EIRR would drop to 12\npercent. However, in the financial projections the average annual GEB pool fuel cost increase\n(for self-generated and IPP power) was assumed to be 4 percent.", "            ECONOMIC INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN\n       For Components A, B and C\n    (Rs Million)\n       HT Industry           Domestic      Commercial      Agriculture    LT Industry\nCapital Operating Cost Total Share in Cost Share in Cost Share in Cost Share in Cost Share in Cost Total  Net Cash\nYear Cost Fixed Variable Cost MkwH Saving M/kWh Saving MkwH Saving MkwH Saving MkwH Saving Benefits Flow\n2001/02       2 ,235      2,235     (2,235)\n2002/03       3 ,352      3,352     (3,352)\n2003/04       3 ,352 140     9 ,028    12,520          357      1,080        129    1 ,533         7 5       298 80      311       2 49       8 37    4,059     (8,461)\n2004/05       2 ,235 223   2 5,369    27,827          934      2,826        344    4 ,096       2 01       795 214      830       6 65     2,237  10,784   (17,043)\n2005/06 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2006/07 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2007/08 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2008/09 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2009/10 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2010/11 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2011/12 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2012/13 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725 9\n3\n2013/14 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2014/15 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2015/16 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2016/17 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2017/18 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2018/19 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2019/20 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\n2020/21 279   6 0,515    60,795       1,014      3,069     2,843  3 3,894    2 ,081    8,222 567   2,201    6 ,875   23,135  70,519      9,725\nEIRR = 25.36%\nNPV =  2 1,579 Rs million\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 1\n8\n, p\na\ng\ne\n 5", "94\n        Appendix 18, page 6\n          Sensitivity Testing for Project Components A, B and C\nVariable EIRR Sensitivity Switching NPV Change\nIndicator Value\nBase Case 25.36 21,579\nCapital Cost  +10% 24.4 0.39 323%  2 0,732 -4%\n+20% 23.51 0.39 19,885 -8%\nFuel Cost 8%\nBenefits\nAll -10% 3.12 14.94 4%  (10,650) -149%\nLT  -10% 19.19 4.93   10,943 -49%\n-20% 12.25 4.92        346 -98%\nAgriculture -10% 24.69 0.52   20,462 -5%\n-20% 24.04 0.51   19,359 -10%\nCommerical -10% 23.23 1.75   17,799 -18%\n-20% 21.05 1.75   14,034 -35%\nDomestic -10% 15.97 7.29     5,856 -73%\n-20% 4.11 7.27    (9,794) -145%\nHT -10% 24.14 0.86   19,732 -9%\n-20% 23 0.84   17,936 -17%\nOne-year delay 24.35 25 1.24   18,910 -12%\nTwo-year dealy 22.08 26 2.45   16,285 -25%\nChanges in Induction & Replacement Shares \nLT base case: 90:10 50:50 share 23.49 1.56 18,218 -16%\n10:90 share 21.57 3.12 14,857 -31%\nDomestic base case 90:150:50 share 53.31 28.27   82,574 283%\n10:90 share 75.05 56.53 143,569 565%\nDomestic using alternative energy sources versus not using alternative energy sources \nBase case: 40:60 50:50 share 34.93 9.25 41,546 93%\n30:70 share 13.37 9.15 1,839 -91%"], "metadata": {"Author": "j3m", "CreationDate": "D:20010820083219Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Keywords": "rrp: 29694 ind, gujarat's power sector allocation", "ModDate": "D:20131111170624+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance Grants to India for the Gujarat Power Sector Development Program"}}
