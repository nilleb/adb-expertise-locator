It facilitates expansion\nof  power  supplies  using  private  generating  capacity,  and\nconservation  of  water  and  electricity.  It  will  support  economic\ngrowth  in  the  state,  particularly  in  the  industry  sector.  It  will  also\nallow  a  shift  in  state  government  expenditures  from  the  power\nsector to its other responsibilities, for example, in the education and\nhealth  sectors.  This  combination  of  higher  economic  growth  and\nshift in public expenditure will contribute to reducing poverty.\n\nGiven  the  present  constraints  on  the  power  sector  in  Gujarat-\npoliticized  tariff  setting  and  lack  of  a  transparent  competitive\nbusiness  environment-,  there  is  a  need  to  change  fundamental\npolicies  and  business  practices  to  improve  sector  efficiencies.\nInvestments  on  their  own,  without  changes  in  policy,  will  not  yield\nresults.  Therefore,  a  mixed-modality  sector  development  program,\nwhich  seeks  to  correct  policies  as  well  as  support  project\ninvestments,  is  considered  the  best  instrument  for  supporting  an\ninitiative for restructuring the power sector.\n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nObjectives and Scope The  immediate  objectives  of  the  Sector  Development  Program  are\nto (i) establish independent tariff setting and regulation; (ii) rationalize\nthe imposition of tariffs, duties, and imposts in the sector to maintain\n(iii) change  management\nequity  among  consumer  categories; \npractices and enhance efficiency in the power sector by introducing\ncompetition and commercialization; and (iv) improve conservation of\nwater  and  electricity  on  a  pilot  basis  through  improved  irrigation\nsystems.\n\nPolicy Framework\nand Actions\n\n(i)\n\nEnactment  of  a  comprehensive  Gujarat  Electricity  Industry\n(Reorganization  and  Regulation)  Bill  2000  (the  Bill)  that\n(a) enables \nindependent\nthe  creation  of  a  statutory, \nregulatory  authority  for  licensing,  tariff  setting,  and  dispute\nresolution; (b) enables functional segregation of the Gujarat\n\n\fii\n\nElectricity  Board  (GEB)  into  generation,  transmission,  and\ndistribution  companies;  (c)  mandates,  over  a  period  of  five\nyears, a gradual increase in the rate of recovery from each\nconsumer  category  of  at  least  67 percent  of  the  cost  to\nserve;  and  (d)  mandates  compulsory  metering  of  every\nconsumer over the next three years.\n\n(ii)\n\nAppointment  of \nCommission (GERC);\n\nthe  Gujarat  Electricity  Regulatory\n\n(iii) \n\nRationalization of tariffs and duties in the power sector;\n\n(iv) \n\nCorporatization of the generation and transmission functions\nof GEB;\n\n(v)\n\nSupport for energy and water conservation; and\n\n(vi) \n\nFinancial restructuring of the sector.\n\nPart  A:  Transmission  lines  and  substations  associated  with  two\nprivate sector power projects and for system improvements.\n\nPart  B:  Transmission  lines  and  substations  associated  with  Kheda\n(Anand), Rajkot, and Mahesana distribution circles.\n\nPart  C:  Upgrading  and  strengthening  of  distribution  systems,\nespecially  in  Kheda  (Anand),  Rajkot,  and  Mahesana  distribution\ncircles.\n\nPart  D:  A  pilot  scheme  for  energy  and  water  conservation  through\nconversion of existing irrigation systems to drip irrigation systems in\nMahesana district.\n\nThe Project\n\nThe Project comprises four components:\n\nCost Estimates\n\nis  estimated \n\nto  cost  $310.2  million  equivalent,\nThe  Project \ncomprising  $200.0  million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $110.2  million\nequivalent in local currency costs.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n($ million)\nPercent\n\nADB\n\nGEB\n\nTotal\n\n200.0\n\n    0.0\n\n200.0\n\n     0.0\n\n200.0\n\n 110.2\n\n 110.2\n\n64.5\n\n35.5\n\n110.2\n\n310.2\n\n100.0\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GEB = Gujarat Electricity Board.\n\nSocial and\nEnvironmental\n\n\fiii\n\nMeasures \n\nThe  project  component  of  the  Sector  Development  Program  (the\nProject)  has  been  classified  as  Category  B  and  a  summary  initial\nenvironmental  examination  (SIEE)  report  has  been  prepared.\nAlthough there are minor construction stage environmental impacts,\nthe long-term operational impacts are positive for the environment.\nThe  Project  helps  conserve  scarce  water  and  energy  by  removing\ntariff distortions and by supporting a pilot scheme for introducing of\nefficient irrigation techniques.\n\nPoverty  impact  assessment  for  the  Sector  Development  Program\nindicates a temporary negative impact on farmers who use pumped\ngroundwater  for  irrigation  on  account  of  the  sharp  upward  revision\nof  electricity  tariffs  to  agriculture  consumers.  This  is  sought  to  be\nmitigated  through  provision  of  technical  and  financial  support  for\nintroducing  of  irrigation  systems  that  use  less  water.  In  the  longer\nterm,  increase  in  tariffs  for  agricultural  consumers  will  have  a\npositive  benefit  in  leading  to  sustainable  agricultural  practices.\nOther social impacts of the Sector Development Program are either\nneutral  or  positive.  The  Sector  Development  Program  will  release\nsubstantial \nthe  Government  of  Gujarat  (the  State\nGovernment), so far used to subsidize the power sector-, to support\nsocial sector programs.\n\nfunds  of \n\n$150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  at  the  pool-\nbased variable lending rate applicable to ADB\u2019s US dollar loans, a 1\npercent  front-end  fee  and  applicable  commitment  charges,  with  a\nterm of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years.\n\nThe period of the Program Loan is December 2000 to June 2002.

The State Government\nwill  use  Counterpart  funds  in  accordance  with  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  to  support  the  financial  restructuring  of  GEB\nand  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  Sector  Development\nProgram, including (i) reduction of GEB's  accounts payable of GEB\nto power producers, suppliers of fuel and transport; (ii) retirement of\nexpensive  commercial  debt,  (iii) payment  of  outstanding  municipal\ndues;  (iv) rationalization  of  electricity  duty;  and  (v)  reduction  of\nindependent power producer tariffs through buyout of debt.\n\n$200 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  at  the  pool-\nbased variable lending rate applicable to ADB\u2019s US dollar loans, a 1\npercent  front-end  fee  and  applicable  commitment  charges,  with  a\nterm of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years.  The borrower\n\nThe Project Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\n\fv\n\nfor \n\nwill  be  the  Government.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  by\nthe  Government  to  the  State  Government  under  its  normal\ntransfer  of  such  external  assistance.  The\narrangements \nproceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  treated  as  \u201cadditional\u201d  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s normal transfers to the State Government. The State\nGovernment  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  GEB,  under  a\nsubsidiary loan agreement, at an interest rate of 12 percent with a\nterm  of  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  The\nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe Project will be executed by GEB, and its successor entities with\nthe  prior  approval  of  ADB.  GEB  is  a  statutory  organization  created\nunder  the  Indian  Electricity  (Supply)  Act,  1948.  It  is  managed  by  a\nboard appointed by the State Government. Successor entities will be\ncompanies registered under the Companies\u2019 Act of 1956.\n\nGoods and services financed by GEB will be procured in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  To  accelerate  project\nimplementation, ADB has allowed advance procurement action. For\nimplementing  of  Part  D  of  the  Project,  GEB  will,  under  its  own\nfinancing, appoint a suitable consultant for design, procurement, and\nproject supervision. Retroactive financing has not been allowed.\n\nThree TAs are included in the Sector Development Program. These\nare (i)  Preparation of a Reorganization Plan for GEB, for $600,000;\n(ii)  Consumer  Awareness  and  Participation \nin  Power  Sector\nReforms,  for  $50,000;  and  (iii) Support  to  GERC,  for  $450,000.\nA fourth  TA  for  supporting  GEB's  Kheda  (Anand)  and  Rajkot\ndistribution  circles  has  been  proposed  for  funding  by  bilateral\ncofinanciers.\n\nThe major risks of the Sector Development Program are (i) failure to\nestablish  the  regulatory  authority,  (ii)  lack  of  support  of  the  State\nGovernment  for  politically  unattractive  decisions  of  the  regulatory\nauthority  such  as  raising  of  electricity \nfor  agriculture\nconsumers,  and  (iii)  operational  inadequacies.  These  have  been\nmitigated  through  (i)  approvals  by  the  State  Government  for    the\nBill   establishing  the  regulatory  authority;  (ii)  GERC\u2019s  first  tariff\naward;  and  (iii)  changing  and  strengthening  organizational  and\nmanagement  structures  and  practices,  and  effective  follow-up\nmechanisms.\n\ntariffs \n\nImplementation \nArrangements and \nExecuting Agency\n\nProcurement and \nConsulting Services\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nTime Frame\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  from  January  2001  to  December\n2004.

The  Report  also  describes  proposed  technical\nassistance for (i) development of a reorganization plan for the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB)\n(ii) consumer awareness and participation in Gujarat's power sector reforms, and (iii) support to\nthe Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC). If the proposed loans are approved by\nthe  Board,  I, acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  shall  approve  the\ntechnical assistance.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn  1996,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  revised  its  operational  strategy  for  India\nand decided to direct a portion of its assistance to the states.  This change reflected the facts\nthat  (i)  a  geographical  focus,  together  with  the  ongoing  selective  sectoral  focus,  would  enable\nADB  to  maximize  its  developmental  impact  on  the  states  concerned,  and  through  the\ndemonstrational  impact  of  its  operations,  on  other  states;  (ii)  state-level  economic  reforms,\nwhich have been lagging behind initiatives taken by the Government of India, need support and\nincentives;  and  (iii)  the  states  have  considerable  autonomy  and  have  major  legislative,\nadministrative, and fiscal responsibilities in many economic and social sectors. Key elements of\nthe strategy include (i) reducing the states\u2019 fiscal deficits, (ii) reforming and restructuring public\nsector  enterprises  to  improve  their  operating  efficiencies,  and  (iii)  supporting  reforms  in  key\ninfrastructure  sectors  with  a  view  to  increasing  private  investment.  Gujarat  was  the  first  state\nchosen for this type of holistic support and the first loan was made by ADB in December 1996.1\nThe  Sector  Development  Program  is  an  integral  part  of  this  assistance  and  is  included  in  the\nIndia Country Assistance Plan for 2000. Preparatory to the Sector Development Program, ADB\napproved  five  supporting  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  amounting  to  $1.98  million,  for\nstudies.2  Preappraisal  was  conducted  during  3-24  September  1997.  Thereafter,  there  was  a\nbreak in processing which was resumed in May 2000. Appraisal was conducted in four stages\nduring July through October 2000. 3\n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nGujarat  is  one  of  the  most  industrialized  states  in  India  and  has  the  fourth  highest  per\n3.\ncapita  income  in  the  country.  The  state's  per  capita  income  in  real  terms  increased  from\nRs11,936  ($257)  in  FY1995  to  RS13,709  ($295)  in  FY1999,  compared  with  the  FY1999\nnational-level per capita real income of Rs11,878 ($255).4 Gujarat also has the third highest per\n\n                  \n\n18 December 1996.\n\n1  Loan  1506-IND:  Gujarat  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n\n2  The  studies  include  (i)  preparation  of  a  power  system  master  plan,  (ii)  preparation  of  a  framework  for  electricity\ntariffs, (iii) review of electricity legislation and regulations, (iv) financial support to Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB)\nfor formation of two independent distribution profit centers, and (v) solicitation for private sector implementation of\nthe Chhara Project.\n\n3  The  Missions  comprised  S.  Chander,  Senior  Project  Engineer,  IWEN  (mission  leader);  K. Gerhaeusser,  Senior\nPrograms Officer, PW2; B. Karunaratne, Senior Project Engineer, IWEN; E. Ouano, Senior Environment Specialist,\nENVD;  P.  Pattison,  Senior  Project  Implementation  Officer,  INRM;  R.  Stroem,  Senior  Financial  Specialist,  IWEN;\nY. Uehara,  Senior  Social  Development  Specialist,  PWOD;  D.  Graczyk,  Project  Economist,  IWEN;  M. Hamano,\nProject Engineer, IWEN;  and V.S. Rekha, Counsel, OGC.\n\n4 Data in real terms are in FY1994 constant prices.\n\n\f2\n\ncapita  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  country.5  It  has  experienced  rapid  growth  in  the\ndevelopment  of  its  economy  over  the  last  five  years,  since  India  started  liberalizing  economic\ncontrols  in  1991.  However,  this  growth  is  now  constrained  by  infrastructural  bottlenecks,  the\nprimary one being lack of electricity. GEB, which is the state\u2019s primary executing agency in the\nsector,  is  unable  to  raise  resources  for  investments  due  to  the  recurring  financial  deficits-  it\nhighly suffers on account of the state\u2019s policy of supplying electricity to agricultural consumers at\nextremely  subsidized  levels.  The  Government  of  Gujarat  (the  State  Government)  has  initiated\nan ambitious policy of inviting private sector participation in the power sector, but this policy is\nencountering difficulties because the sector revenues at current levels are insufficient to service\nthe  large  inflow  of  capital  that  is  required.  The  State  Government  is  making  strong  efforts  to\nmaintain  fiscal  discipline  in  its  overall  finances,  but  is  constrained  by  its  payables  to  GEB  on\nelectricity  subsidies  to  agricultural  consumers  which  have  escalated  to  about  20  percent  of  its\ntotal  revenues.  This  adversely  affects  resource  availability  for  other  important  areas  of\ninfrastructure  as  well  as  for  social  services  thus  causing  the  state  to  lag  behind  in\nsocioeconomic indicators compared with other economically advanced states in India. Thus, a\ncomprehensive restructuring of the power sector is essential to the state\u2019s overall economic and\nsocial development.\n\nB. \n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n1. \n\nOrganization\n\n4.\nIndia consists of 28 states and 7 union territories with a total population of over 1 billion.\nIts  power  sector  is  the  third  largest  in  Asia,  after  that  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and\nJapan. Installed generation capacity grew from about 2,000 megawatts (MW) in 1950 to about\n98,000 MW as of 31 March 2000, with an additional 12,000 MW of captive generation capacity.\nMore  than  77 million  electricity  consumers  and  about  86  percent  of  villages  have  been\nelectrified.  However,  the  annual  per  capita  consumption  was  only  about  360  kilowatt-hours\n(kWh)  in  FY2000,  which  is  lower  than  the  consumption  levels  of  many  other  developing\ncountries.\n\n5.\nThe  organization  of  the  power  sector  is  determined  by  India\u2019s  federal  structure.  The\nGovernment\u2019s  Ministry  of  Power  provides  overall  guidance  to  the  sector,  mainly  through  the\nCentral  Electricity  Authority,  and  owns  the  central  power  sector  utilities  such  as  the  National\nThermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), the\nNuclear  Power  Corporation  (NPC),  and  the  Powergrid  Corporation  of  India  (Powergrid),  and\nfinancing institutions such as the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Rural Electrification\nCorporation. State governments control the rest of the sector through 20 state electricity boards\n(SEBs) and 12 electricity departments (EDs). These SEBs and EDs provide distribution facilities\nand  set  retail  tariffs.  Power  generation  and  transmission  are  split  between  the  central  power\nsector agencies and SEBs. The central agencies own and operate 32 percent of the country\u2019s\ntotal  generation,  while  SEBs  and  EDs  have  64  percent  of  the  total.  In  addition,  five  private\nutilities in urban agglomerations have a share of 4 percent in power generation.\n\nAs a result of India\u2019s federal structure, all major issues affecting the power sector require\n6.\nconcurrent action by the Government and state governments. Although the structure gives the\nGovernment  a  say  in  the  affairs  of  the  power  sectors  of  the  states,  this  shared  responsibility\nlimits  its  ability  to  influence  the  power  sector  policies  of  state  governments,  especially  with\nrespect to retail tariffs.\n\n5  Per capita consumption of 650 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per annum in FY2000 compared with the national average of\n\n                  \n\n360 kWh per annum.\n\n\f2. \n\nState Electricity Boards\n\n3\n\n7.\nPrior to the reorganization of the power sectors in the states of Orissa (1996), Haryana\n(1998), Andhra Pradesh (1999), Karnataka (1999), and Uttar Pradesh (2000), the power sector\nin  every  major  state  was  organized  through  its  SEB.  Even  today,  other  than  in  these  states,\nSEBs  still  control  the  operations  of  the  sector.  The  Electricity  Act  of  1910  and  the  Electricity\n(Supply)  Act  of  1948  with  their  several  amendments  provide  the  legal  basis  for  the  sector\u2019s\nfunctioning  and  utilities\u2019  operation.  These  acts  allow  considerable  managerial  and  financial\nautonomy  to  the  SEBs,  but  this  autonomy  is  often  nominal  as  most  state  governments  use\nSEBs to pursue noncommercial objectives, particularly to provide low-priced or free electricity to\nthe agriculture sector. Initially, this cross-subsidization was done to provide low-cost inputs for\nagriculture  to  stimulate  food  production  and  was  very  successful.  However,  that  stage  is  now\nwell past but  the practice has continued largely to attract political support. State governments\nalso  tend  to  interfere  with  SEBs'  day-to-day  operations,  thus  complicating  the  task  of  SEB\nmanagement.  These  interventions  have  led  to  the  SEBs\u2019  deteriorating  financial  health,  which\nhas become the central problem of India\u2019s power sector.\n\n8.\nSeveral years of negative internal cash generation has impoverished SEBs, impeded the\nconstruction  of  new  power  facilities,  and  restricted  the  funds  available  for  maintenance  and\nrehabilitation of existing assets, making it impossible to close the demand-supply gap. Chronic\npower  shortages  and  poor-quality  power  supply  continue  to  plague  the  economy  in  almost  all\nparts of the country. If not remedied, the unavailability of sufficient power will be the single most\nimportant  constraint  to  economic  development  in  the  coming  years  and  will  thwart  efforts  to\nattract domestic and foreign investment.\n\n9.\nA reform of the power sector at the state level is urgently needed to reduce the need for\nsubsidies and public spending on the sector. As a result of the state governments' interference\nin  SEB  operation  and  subsidies  to  agricultural  customers,  sector  losses  in  FY1999  reached\nRs63.3  billion  ($1.4  billion),  but  were  reduced  to  Rs45.0 billion  ($1.0  billion)  by  subsidies  from\nstate  governments.  Power  sector  reform  will  significantly  reduce  claims  on  the  country\u2019s  fiscal\nresources and allow additional spending on other priority sectors such as health and education,\nwhich are essential for poverty reduction.\n\n3. \n\nCentral Power Utilities\n\n10.\nUntil 1972, SEBs were almost solely responsible for power generation and transmission\nwithin  their  states,  but  were  unable  to  meet  the  rapidly  increasing  demand  for  electricity.  To\nimprove  the  efficiency  of  generation,  three  central  sector  agencies  -  NTPC,  NHPC  and  NPC-,\nwere  established  in  1975  to  generate  bulk  power  for  sale  to  SEBs.  In  1989,  Powergrid  was\nestablished  as  a  transmission  and  dispatch  company  by  amalgamating  the  transmission  and\ndispatch  assets  of  all  central  power  sector  agencies.  In  addition  to  these  wholly  owned\ncompanies, the Government also has shares in special-purpose generating companies such as\nthe  Bhakra-Beas  Management  Board,  the  Damodar  Valley  Corporation,  the  Tehri  Power\nCorporation, the Nathpa-Jhakhri Power Corporation, the North-East Electric Power Corporation,\nand the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.\n\n11.\nThe central agencies - NTPC, NHPC, and Powergrid - are seriously affected by the poor\nfinancial  health  of  most  SEBs,  as  was  evidenced  several  times  in  the  past  when  excessive\naccounts  receivable  from  the  SEBs  seriously  impaired  the  central  agencies\u2019  financial  liquidity.\nTo resolve this problem, NTPC has, in addition to restricting supply and obtaining Government\n\n\f4\n\nappropriation to settle debts of SEBs, resorted to taking over the generation facilities of SEBs in\nsettlement of accounts receivable.6\n\n4. \n\nThe Gujarat Power Sector\n\nthe  Surat  Electricity  Company  (SECO), \n\nThe  power  sector  in  Gujarat  comprises  GEB,  the  Ahmedabad  Electricity  Company\n12.\n(AECO)  and \ntwo  private  sector  generation\nand distribution  licensees  in  the  cities  of  Ahmedabad  and  Surat,  respectively.  Recently,  about\n3,000 MW capacity of captive generation and of independent power producers (IPPs) has been\nsanctioned. The state has experienced an increase in demand for electricity of about 9 percent\nper  annum  over  the  last  five  years.  This  rate  of  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in\nthe foreseeable  future  since  the  state  has  been  attracting  a  large  share  of  the  overseas  and\ndomestic investments made in India following the liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991.\nThe key indicators for Gujarat\u2019s power sector are given in Appendix 1. In FY2000 the shares of\nthe various utilities in power sector operations were as given in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Comparison of Electric Power Utilities in Gujarat in FY2000\n\nUtility\n\nGeneration Share\n\nGEB a\nAECO\nSECO\nCentral Utilities\nIPPs\n\nTotal\n\nMW\n4,534\n510\n0\n1,532\n1,785\n\n8,361\n\nGWh\n23,177\n3,393\n0\n10,058\n6,658\n\n43,286\n\n%\n53.54\n7.84\n0.0\n23.24\n15.38\n\nDistribution Share\nGWh\n29,135\n3,173\n1,769\n0\n0\n\n%\n85.5\n9.3\n5.2\n0\n0\n\n100.0\n\n34,077\n\n100.0\n\nAECO = Ahmedabad Electric Company,  GWh = gigawatt-hours, GEB = Gujarat Electricity Board,\nIPP = independent power producer, SECO = Surat Electricity Company, MW = megawatts,\n\na    GEB owns and operates the transmission network in the state.\n\nC. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n13.\nDuring FY1999, load shedding was experienced ranging between 50 MW and 1,450 MW\non  362  days  of  the  year.  Gujarat  is  facing  an  anticipated  shortfall  of  about  7,000  MW  of\ngenerating  capacity  over  the  next  decade  and  has  invited  private  sector  proposals  for\ndeveloping  over  4,000  MW  of  capacity  over  the  next  five  years.  However,  the  actualization  of\nthis investment will be constrained by the inflow of revenues into the sector and the perception\nby  domestic  and  international  investors  of  an  efficient  and  impartial  regulatory  system.  The\nState  Government,  therefore,  wishes  to  amend  the  existing  legislation  and  regulations  with  a\nview to enacting a new law that would address the concerns of the investors as well as create\na business  environment  conducive  to  improving  the  sector\u2019s  (i)  operational  efficiencies,\n(ii) financial viability, and (iii) service to its consumers. It proposes to do this through (i) greater\ncompetition  at  all \nthe  sector  wherever  practicable;  (ii)  corporatization  and\ncommercialization  of  existing  sector  entities;  (iii)  private  sector  participation  in  the  generation\nand  distribution  segments;  (iv)  viable  tariffs  that  enable  costs  to  be  recovered  and  reasonable\nprofits  to  be  made;  (v)  an  independent  regulator;  and  (vi)  transparent,  reasonable,  direct,  and\n\nlevels  of \n\n                  \n\n6  As  part  of  the  agreement  to  make  NTPC  the  Executing  Agency  for  Loan  907-IND: Unchahar Thermal Power\nProject,  for  $160.0  million,  approved  on  29  September  1988,ADB,  the  Government  of  India,  the  Government  of\nUttar Pradesh, and NTPC agreed to transfer the title to the 420-MW stage I to NTPC. NTPC has since taken over\nthe  Talcher  Thermal  Power  Station  from  Orissa  SEB,  and  the  Tanda  Thermal  Power  Station  from  Uttar  Pradesh\nSEB.\n\n\f5\n\nquantified subsidies to vulnerable sections of consumers. In 1995, GOG revised its power policy\nto incorporate these principles.\n\n14.\nSubsidized electricity tariffs for agricultural consumers represent a key issue that has to\nbe  addressed  in  reforming  sector.  In  line  with  the  practice  in  other  states  in  India  with  large\nagricultural  production,  the  State  Government  has  been  providing  the  agriculture  sector  with\nsubsidized electricity. The rationale was that prices of agricultural outputs are controlled and that\ninexpensive inputs are required to compensate for these price controls and provide an incentive to\nincrease  agricultural  production,  so  that  India  can  be  self-sufficient  in  food.  This  argument  has\ndistorted  the  pricing  of  electricity  in  Gujarat  to  such  an  extent  that  the  electricity  tariffs  for  the\nindustrial  and  commercial  sectors  are  higher  than  the  long-run  marginal  cost  of  power  supply,\nwhile  the  tariff  for  about  0.5  million  agricultural  consumers,  prior  to  October  2000,  was\nRs350 ($7.50)  per  horsepower  of  load  connected  per  year,7  which  in  FY2000  led  to  a  revenue\nrealization of only Re0.15 per kWh ($0.003 per kWh).\n\n15.\nBased on the cost of new generation, each incremental kWh of agricultural consumption\nrequires a subsidy of at least Rs2.00 per kWh ($0.04 per kWh) for generation plus an additional\nRe1.00 per kWh ($0.02 per kWh) for transmission and distribution. This situation has resulted in\n(i) GEB not having resources to finance its expansion to meet unserved demand; (ii) agricultural\nconsumers  not  receiving  a  signal  that  electricity  is  a  scarce  resource  and,  accordingly,  not\nconserving it; (iii) other consumer groups, particularly industrial consumers, paying high tariffs that\nimpair their competitiveness and consequently establishing their own generation facilities, eroding\nGEB's consumer mix; and (iv) GEB being unable, without subsidies from the State Government,\nto  earn  a  return  on  its  investments  as  prescribed  by  law.  The  provision  of  heavily  subsidized\nelectricity to agriculture consumers has boosted its share of consumption from 16.7 percent of all\nelectricity sold in the state in FY1971 to 43.0 percent in FY2000. The loss incurred by GEB on this\naccount is estimated at Rs14.0 billion ($0.3 billion) during FY2000.\n\nAs  a  result  of  efforts  made  by  the  National  Development  Council  (NDC)8,  a  high-level\n16.\ncommittee  on  power  was  constituted  in  June  1993.  In  its  report  submitted  in  October  1994,\nthe committee recommended (i) organizational reforms at the state level: commercialization, and\nunbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution of the SEBs; (ii) organizational reforms at\nregional  and  national  levels  to  strengthen  the  role  of  the  central  sector  agencies,  freeing  them\nfrom government control, allowing them to implement new projects on a joint-venture basis with\nthe  private  sector,  and  ultimately  reducing  Government's  equity  in  them  to  not  more  than\n26 percent;  (iii)  large-scale  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  generation  and  distribution,  with\nthe sponsors selected through transparent and competitive bidding procedures; (iv) depoliticizing\nelectricity tariff setting by creating a national tariff board for regulating bulk tariffs at the national\nlevel  and  regional  tariff  boards  for  regulating  bulk  and  retail  tariffs  for  both  public  and  private\nutilities at the state level; and (v) progressive phasing out of subsidies to agricultural consumers,\nwith a minimum tariff of not less than 50 percent of the average cost of supply to be introduced in\nthe first phase.9 These recommendations had been renewed in the meetings of NDC in October\nand  December  1996  and  a  document  titled  Common  Minimum  National  Action  Plan  for  Power\nwas published by the Government based on the last meeting. However, not much progress has\nbeen achieved in these reform areas to date.\n\n                  \n\n7 GEB does not meter its agricultural consumers; hence, tariff is based on connected load.\n8 NDC is India's highest political body. It is chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises the Chief Ministers of all the\n\nstates in India.\n\n9 In the previous reports and conclusions of the conferences of power ministers, reference was made to a  minimum\nagricultural tariff of Rs0.50 per kWh ($0.011 per kWh). The general call for such a minimum tariff has become largely\na political issue because the figure of Rs0.50 per kWh has no logical basis other than it is higher than the current tariff.\nTo date, only seven states have increased the electricity tariff for agricultural  consumers to this level.\n\n\f6\n\nTwo  other  major  points  in  the  sector\u2019s  restructuring  are  (i)  introducing  private  sector\n17.\nparticipation in the power sector, and (ii) reforming of SEBs. On account of the dualistic nature\nof  the  Indian  power  sector,  all  fundamental  changes  have  to  be  effected  through  a  political\nconsensus  between  the  Government  and  the  state  governments.  In  1991,  the  Government\neffected  major  amendments  to  the  Electricity  and  Electricity  (Supply)  Acts,  which  enabled  the\nstate  governments  to  invite  private  sector  investment  in  generation  and  distribution.  Although\nthe response from the investor community has been very positive, the states have not been able\nto capitalize on this sentiment on account of the noncommercial environment of the sector and\nlack of a transparent and fair regulatory mechanism. For a start, with assistance from the World\nBank,  ADB,  and  other  aid  agencies,  the  state  of  Orissa  in  1995  enacted  comprehensive\nlegislation  that  allowed  separation  of  Orissa  SEB\u2019s  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution\nfunctions  (i.e., unbundling);  corporatization  of  the  sector  entities;  and  appointment  of  an\nindependent  regulator  for  the  sector.  However,  this  start  has  not  been  without  its  share  of\nproblems. Lack of competitive standards in the power sector,  an emphasis on privatization for\nits  own  sake  rather  than  for  effecting  improvements  in  quality  of  supply  and  consumer\nsatisfaction, the seeking of higher returns on investment without corresponding improvements in\nsupply,  and  improper  sequencing  have  undermined  the  gains  made  in  non-political  and\ntransparent tariff setting and private sector participation in generation and distribution.\n\nD. \n\nState Government Expenditure\n\n18.\nUnder  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY1998-FY2002),  the  State  Government  plans  to  get\ninstalled  an  additional  4,300  MW  of  generating  capacity.  Of  this,  GEB  will  install  only  four\nthermal  generating  units  for  460  MW,  and  IPPs  will  install  about  4,000  MW  of  the  additional\ncapacity.  GEB  is  making  the  necessary  investment  in  transmission  and  distribution  under  the\nNinth  Plan  to  evacuate  the  output  power  from  new  generation  units  and  to  transmit  and\ndistribute to customers. The investment includes 1,604 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of 400 kilovolt\n(kV)  transmission  lines,  5,475  cct-km  of  220  kV  transmission  lines,  3,100  megavolt  amperes\n(MVA)  of  transformer  capacity  in  400  kV  substations,  and  5,300  MVA  transformer  capacity  in\n220  kV  substations.  In  the  Ninth  Plan  the  State  Government  proposes  to  invest  Rs37.0 billion\n($0.8 billion)  for  developing  of  its  power  sector.  This  allocation  represents  an  increase  of\n41 percent over the allocation for the Eighth Five-Year Plan at Rs26.25 billion and reflects the\nincreased  priority  on  this  sector  in  the  State  Government\u2019s  plans.  Within  the  sector,  the  plan\nreveals a strong emphasis on upgrading the transmission and distribution network with about 69\npercent of the total allocation. The phasing and allocation of the proposed outlay are presented\nin Table 2 .\n\nItem\n\nTable 2:  Power Sector Allocation in Gujarat\u2019s Ninth Plan (FY1998-FY2002)\n(Rs million)\nFY2000\n106\n1,938\n4,886\n524\n9\n7,463\n\nFY1998 FY1999\n53\n3,137\n4,708\n325\n12\n8,245\n\n299\n1,530 10,998\n5,500 23,621\n2,109\n62\n7,560 37,041\n\nTotal Percent\n0.9\n29.7\n63.7\n5.6\n0.2\n100.0\n\nFY2001 FY2002\n0\n\n95\n2,160\n4,780\n510\n15\n7,560\n\n46\n2,233\n3,746\n230\n6\n6,261\n\n  Hydro Generation\n  Thermal Generation\n  T & D a\n  Rural Electrification\n  Others\n\n510\n20\n\nTotal\n\na  Transmission and distribution.\n\nThis  level  of  investment  will  be  adequate  to  fulfill  demands  for  electricity  only  if  about\n19.\n4,000 MW of capacity ($4 billion of investment) is installed by the private sector during the plan\nperiod. Given the negative returns now being made by GEB in the transmission and distribution\nsegments of the business on account of the highly subsidized agricultural tariffs, revenues will\n\n\f7\n\nnot  be  sufficient  to  service  this  additional  investment,  irrespective  of  whether  the  distribution\nsystem  is  privatized  or  not.  Thus,  the  key  to  the  sustainability  of  operations  in  the  sector\ninvolves changing the business environment and rationalizing tariffs.\n\nE. \n\nThe State Government\u2019s Objectives and Strategy\n\n20.\nThe State Government aims to create a business environment that would be conducive\nto  improving  the  sector\u2019s  (i)  operating  efficiencies,  (ii)  financial  viability,  (iii) service  to  its\nconsumers,  and  (iv)  conservation  of  electricity.  It  proposes  to  do  this  by  (i) encouraging  and\nfacilitating  private  sector  participation  in  power  generation  and  distribution  and  fostering  a\ntransparent  and  competitive  environment  with  equal  opportunities  for  the  public  and  private\nsectors;  (ii)  optimizing  the  operations  of  the  power  utilities;  (iii) tariffs  based  on  commercial\nprinciples that enable costs to be recovered and reasonable returns to be made on investments;\n(iv) \ntariff  setting  backed  up  by  statutory  provisions;  and\n(v) transparent,  reasonable,  direct  and  quantified  subsidies  to  targeted  sections  of  consumers.\nThe  State  Government  wishes  to  comprehensively  amend  the  existing  legislation,  regulations,\nand  tariffs  on  the  subject  to  bring  into  effect  the  above  principles.  It  issued  a  comprehensive\npower policy document in December 1995 followed by a Letter of Intent to ADB in March 1996.\nAfter  detailed  discussions  with  ADB  as  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  associated  with  the  Sector\nDevelopment Program, the State Government submitted its development policy letter (Appendix\n2), which includes a policy matrix.\n\nindependent  regulation  and \n\nF. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nThe power sector has received a major portion of India's external assistance. Of ADB\u2019s\n21.\ntotal  Government-guaranteed  lending  to  India  amounting  to  $7.968  billion  as  of  31  October\n2000, seven loans for $1.505 billion (19 percent) had been approved for the power sector. The\nfirst four projects  were  for power  generation; the three most recent have been sector loans to\nsupport improvements in the efficiency of SEBs and development of the national transmission\ngrid. In addition, ADB's private sector group (PSG) has approved three loans and investments\ntotaling  $79.8  million  for  one  captive  transmission  and  two  generation  projects  10.  Power\nsubprojects  have  also  been  considered  for  financing  under  ADB's  private  sector  infrastructure\nfacility11  and  the  Infrastructure  Development  Finance  Company12.  ADB  also  approved\n$12.2 million for 18  TAs,  mainly  advisory, at both the national and state levels. The TAs have\nfocused  on  environmental  and  pollution  control  issues  related  to  power  generation,  bulk\ntransmission  tariffs,  improving  least-cost  system  planning,  tariff  studies  at  the  retail  level,\nimprovement  of  technical  and  commercial  operations,  power  sector  restructuring,  and\nestablishment  of  an  independent  regulatory  authority.  Previous  ADB  assistance  to  the  power\nsector in India is listed in Appendix 3.\n\nThe  major  funding  source  to  the  sector  is  the  World  Bank  group.  NTPC,  the  World\n22.\nBank's  largest  client  worldwide,  has  been  a  major  beneficiary  of  this  assistance.  The  World\nBank  has  supported  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects,  including\nassistance  directed  to  SEBs.  ADB  coordinates  with  the  World  Bank  on  the  geographical\n\n                  \n\n10 Loan 7058/1036-IND: CESC Limited, for $17.8 million, approved on 4 October 1990; Loan 7082/1142-IND: CESC\nLimited II, for $32.0 million, approved on 13 December 1991; and Loan 7130/1499-IND: Balagarh Power Company\nLimited, for $15 million in equity  and a  loan of $25 million, approved on 5 December 1996.\n\n11  Loan  1480-IND:  Private Sector Facility: Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd.;  1481-IND:\nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Facility: Industrial Finance Corp. of India Ltd.; 1482-IND: Private Sector Infrastructure\nFacility: SCICI Ltd.; for a total of $300 million, approved on 7 November 1996.\n\n12 Investment 7138-IND: Infrastructure Development Finance Company, for $30 million equity investment, approved\non 14 October 1997. The loan amount was subsequently reduced to $15.463 million due to greater than expected\nsubscription from the investors.\n\n\f8\n\ndemarcation of state-level operations, as well as to ensure overall complementarity of actions at\nboth the central and state levels. ADB and the World Bank have concurrent ongoing operations\nfor  different  projects  with  three  organizations:  PFC,  Powergrid,  and  NTPC.  Other  major\nagencies  funding  the  sector  are  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),\nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW,  for  the  Government  of  Germany),  the  Department  for\nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  (DFID),  the  Canadian  International\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\n(USAID).  Although  the  combined  assistance  of  all  aid  agencies  constitutes  only  about  8-10\npercent of the total investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed\nas a result of this assistance. Major external assistance provided to the power sector by other\naid agencies is also listed in Appendix 3.\n\nThe  World  Bank  is  supporting  power  sector  reforms  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,\n23.\nHaryana, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. In Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, power\nsector reform is viewed as part of overall reform of state finances as is being supported by ADB\nin Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nJBIC  is  supporting  the  expansion  of  public  sector  generation,  transmission,  and\n\n24.\ndistribution including rural electrification. It has no geographic preferences.\n\nDFID\u2019s  exclusive  objective  in  providing  assistance  is  poverty  reduction.  It  is  financing\n25.\nstudies  for  restructuring  the  power  sector  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  and  Orissa.  It  has  no\nplans  to  participate  in  financing  hardware  other  than  in  renewable  energy  systems.  It  has\noffered  to  cooperate  with  ADB  in  funding  studies  for  power  sector  restructuring  in  Madhya\nPradesh  and  West  Bengal  and  to  assist  these  states  in  other  areas  also,  such  as  the  social\ninfrastructure sectors.\n\n26.\nUSAID  has  extensively  supported  and  continues  to  support  policy  aspects  of  private\nsector participation. It has supported studies for state sector reforms through PFC, and through\nprovision of grant assistance for energy management, conservation, and training. It is working\nwith ADB and PFC for studies in Assam, Punjab, and West Bengal.\n\nCIDA  has  assisted  Kerala  in  conducting  extensive  studies  for  restructuring  its  power\n27.\nsector,  and  is  working  with  ADB  in  conducting  such  studies  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  with  the\nWorld Bank in Andhra Pradesh. ADB is following up on CIDA's work in Kerala through its policy\ndialogue and preparations for a possible loan project.\n\n28.\nThe broad policy content of the Sector Development Program has been discussed with\nall the aid agencies that have supported activities associated with sector reforms at the central\nand state levels. All agencies have expressed general support for it.\n\nG. \n\nADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategy\n\n1. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n29.\nThe  operations  of  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  in  the  power  sector  in  India  have\ngenerally been successful from a project point of view; i.e., the projects concerned have been\ncompleted, although with implementation delays, and performed to the desired technical levels.\nHowever,  except  for  the  ongoing  loans  to  Powergrid13,  these  projects  were  not  designed  to\nchange  the  business  environment,  and  sector  performance  has  continued  to  deteriorate,\n\n                  \n\n13 Loan  1405-IND:  Power Transmission (Sector) Project,  for  $275  million,  approved  on  16  November  1995  and\nLoan 1764-IND: Power Transmission Improvement (Sector) Project, for $250 million, approved on 6 October 2000.\n\n\f9\n\nalthough  the  operations  of  the  project  components,  taken  individually,  were    satisfactory.  This\nwas  primarily  on  account  of  (i) politicized  tariff  setting;  (ii) rapid  growth  of  the  demand  for\nelectricity,  making  conventional  investment  strategies  unworkable;  (iii)  government  rules  and\nregulations  and  control  of  the  SEBs  that  inhibited  speedy  decision  making;  and  (iv)  the\nnoncommercial  setup  of  the  sector  that  did  not  generate  the  market  for  alternative  players  to\nstep in to bridge the gap between supply and demand.\n\n30.\nIn the past, ADB extended assistance to discrete power projects in various states as well\nas  to  the  central  power  sector  agencies.  Although  the  policy  enabled  ADB  to  support  many\nprojects, it spread ADB's resources too thinly, with the result that it could not achieve its desired\ngoal of policy reforms with its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector was the\nlargest  recipient  of  state  resources  in  terms  of  both  subsidies  and  capital  investments,  and  it\nwas  realized  that  macro  management  of  the  state's  finances  needed  to  be  improved  for  the\nsuccessful turnaround of the power sector. Therefore, ADB is now assisting selected states for\npower  sector  reforms  only  in  the  context  of  a  holistic  change  in  their  macroeconomic\nmanagement.\n\n2. \n\nOperational Strategy\n\n31.\nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  in  India  is  to  support  efforts  to  achieve  higher  sustainable\neconomic growth to promote employment and reduce poverty. Its contribution to higher growth\nfocuses  on  improving  the  supply  side  efficiency  of  the  economy,  especially  by  reducing\nbottlenecks in key infrastructure sectors. Emphasis is on improving the policy, institutional, and\nregulatory  framework  so  as  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  operations  and  to\nencourage  private  investment.  Improving  resource  mobilization  to  finance  the  necessary\ninvestments  is  a  key  component  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  and  includes  support  for  developing  of\nfinancial and capital markets as well as for improving internal resource mobilization in the sector\nagencies  and  enhancing  their  creditworthiness.  High  priority  is  also  given  to  assisting  projects\nthat contribute to environmental improvement.\n\n32.\nADB's  strategy  for  India  was  revised  in  1996  to  accommodate  an  urgent  need  for  a\nportion  of  its  assistance  to  be  provided  in  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  way  at  the  sub-\nnational or state level. This need reflects the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with the\nongoing selective sector focus, enables ADB to maximize its developmental impact both in the\nstates concerned and, through the demonstrational impact of its operations, in other states as\nwell;  (ii)  state-level  economic  reforms,  which  have  been  lagging  behind  initiatives  taken\nby the Government,  need  support  and  incentives;  and  (iii)  the  states  have  considerable\nautonomy  and  have  major  legislative,  administrative,  and  fiscal  responsibilities  in  many\neconomic and social sectors. Key elements of the subnational assistance include (i) improving\nthe  states'  public  resources  management,  (ii) reforming  and  restructuring  public  sector\nenterprises  to  improve  operating  efficiencies,  and  (iii)  supporting  reforms  in  key  infrastructure\nsectors with a view to increasing private investment. Gujarat was the first state chosen for this\ntype of holistic support and the first loan was granted by ADB in December 1996 (footnote 1).\nMadhya Pradesh was the second focal state and its loan was accorded in December 199914.\n\nReflecting  ADB\u2019s  overall  country  strategy  for  India,  and  in  recognition  of  the  dualistic\n33.\nstructure  of  India's  power  sector,  ADB's  strategy  for  the  sector,  which  has  been  pursued  in\ncoordination  with  the  World  Bank,  intends  to  operate  at  two  levels.  At  the  central  level,\nassistance to central power sector companies such as Powergrid (footnote 13) and PFC15 aims\n\n14 Loan  1717-IND:  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Resource  Management  Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n\n15  Loan  No.  1161-IND: Power Efficiency (Sector) Project,  for  $250  million,  approved  on  26  March  1992.  The  loan\n\n                  \n\n14 December 1999.\n\naccount was closed on 18 December 1998.\n\n\f10\n\nto  support  their  commercialization  and  use  them  as  agents  to  leverage  reform  in  their  client\nSEBs. Through Powergrid, ADB also seeks, at the central level, to implement nationwide power\nsector  reforms  by  establishing  of  model  cases  in  tariff  structures,  competitive  pool  operations,\nregulating power supply to delinquent SEBs, and investments based on commercial viability of\nprojects.  At  the  state  level,  ADB  is  building  up  the  reform  process  from  the  grassroots  by\nconsidering  assistance  only  for  states  that  demonstrate  the  political  will  to  substantially\nrestructure  and  commercialize  their  power  sectors,  and  by  assisting  them  to  actualize  the\nreforms. Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala have been identified for ADB\u2019s holistic support.\nImprovements in the power sector will increase the fiscal space of the state governments and\nincrease  their  ability  to  allocate  more  resources  for  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic\ndevelopment.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nA  comprehensive  program  of  reform-oriented  studies  has  been  initiated  through  ADB's\n34.\ntechnical assistance.16 As a subset of the total reforms and GEB\u2019s proposed investments in the\nNinth  Plan  period  (FY1998-FY2002),  the  Sector  Development  Program  seeks  to  further  the  key\nobjectives of the reform process that will mobilize greater resources for the power sector to enable\nrealization of, and a possible increase in, the total investment. It includes support and incentives\nfor restructuring the power sector as program assistance, and support for actual investments for\nevacuation and distribution of power from proposed private sector IPP generation projects as well\nas  in  hitherto  relatively  neglected  areas  of  metering,  energy  end-use  management,  and  system\nloss reduction.\n\n35.\nThe  Program  has  been  designed  to  reduce  GEB\u2019s  operating  costs,  raise  additional\nrevenues  and  progressively  eliminate  the  need  for  transfers  from  the  State  Government's\nbudget, allow the expansion of power supplies using private generating capacity, and improve\nthe  environmental  consequences  of  power  use.  It  will  support  economic  growth  in  the  state,\nparticularly  in  industry,  and  sustain  production  in  agriculture.  It  will  also  shift  the  focus  of  the\nState Government's expenditures from power supply to other responsibilities, for example, in the\neducation and health sectors.\n\n36.\nThe  Sector  Development  Program  seeks  to  establish  a  business  environment  in  the\npower sector that promotes efficiency and growth and to support critical investments required to\nbuild up on the new environment that is created. Since both facets of development are important\nfor  the  success  of  the  reforms,  the  sector  development  assistance  modality  has  been\nconsidered.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n37.\nThe immediate objectives of the Sector Development Program are to provide support and\nincentives to the State Government and GEB for (i) sector reform activities such as independent\ntariff  setting,  tariff  rationalization,  and  functional  segregation  of  GEB\u2019s  activities;  (ii)  establishing\ntransmission  systems  linked  with  IPP  generation  projects;  (iii)  modernizing  and  upgrading\ndistribution systems, especially those in the Anand, Rajkot, and Mahesana distribution circles; and\n(iv)  water  and  electricity  conservation  measures.  The  entire  exercise  is  geared  to  improve  the\n\n                  \n\n16  The  studies  include  (i)  preparation  of  a  power  system  master  plan;  (ii)  preparation  of  a  framework  for  electricity\ntariffs;  (iii)  review  of  electricity  legislation  and  regulations;  (iv)  financial  support  to  GEB  for  formation  of  two\nindependent distribution profit centers; and (v) solicitation for private sector implementation of the Chhara Project.\n\n\f11\n\npower sector\u2019s financial and economic viability over the next five years to ensure sustained growth\nof the sector. Appendix 4 shows the Sector Development Program framework. TA for reorganizing\nof GEB, consultation with electricity consumers, and supporting the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory\nCommission (GERC) are part of the Sector Development Program.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n38.\nThe Sector Development Program will assist Gujarat in effecting matching reforms to take\nadvantage of the 1991 policy of the Government. To make its interventions more policy oriented\nand focused, it concentrates assistance in the power sector to a state that is undertaking  reforms\nin its macro finances and has agreed to restructure its power sector and includes comprehensive,\nalbeit  gradual  approach  to  restructuring  the  sector  allowing  for  development  of  (i) successor\norganizations  to  GEB,  (ii)  a  commercial  culture,  (iii)  consumer  benefits  in  terms  of  quality  of\nsupply, and (iv) rationalized tariffs and duties.\n\n39.\nADB has been conducting policy dialogue on the Sector Development Program at three\nlevels;  (i)  with  the  Government  on  countrywide  changes  that  need  to  be  done  to  prepare  an\nenabling framework for sector reforms; (ii) with the State Government for the policy aspects of\nthe  reforms  in  the  state;  and  (iii) with  GEB  for  the  Project  and  organizational  aspects  of  the\nreforms. The issues discussed are as follows.\n\n1. \n\nMetering\n\n40.\nAt  present,  agriculture  and  socially  disadvantaged  consumers  are  provided  electricity\nwithout  meters  on  the  premise  that  the  revenues  realized  from  them  do  not  justify  the  costs\nincurred in installing meters and using them. However, this practice has led to a sharp increase in\nconsumption from such connections, a large part of which is theft of electricity. A recent survey\nindicates that over 43 percent of GEB's sales is through unmetered supply. Hence, installation of\nmeters on all consumer connections is a priority for GEB.\n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation\n\nOne  of  the  main  objectives  of  the  Sector  Development  Program  is  to  facilitate  private\n41.\nsector participation in the power sector in Gujarat. It is expected that structured introduction of\nsuch participation will (i) provide additional capital, (ii) lead to greater commercialization in the\nsector,  (iii) improve  operational  efficiencies  in  the  sector,  and  (iv)  provide  a  competitive\nenvironment.  Structuring  this  participation  is  essential  to  realize  the  stated  benefits  since  it  is\nimportant  that  the  profit  motive  of  the  private  sector  be  appropriately  channeled.  Gujarat  has\nhad  a  long  tradition  of  private  sector  generation  and  distribution,  but  on  account  of  an\ninadequate  business  environment,  the  investments  have  not  been  as  efficient  as  they  should\nbe. Restructuring requires three key actions: (i) formulation of a least-cost expansion plan that\ndovetails  investments  from  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  so  as  to  maximize  the  overall\nbenefits  of  investments;  (ii)  setting  up  a  tariff  regime  that  does  not  distort  costs  and  prices  so\nthat  market-driven  indicators  are  provided  to  optimize  operations;  and  (iii) creating  a statutory\nregulatory authority independent of the State Government that ensures freedom of entry into the\nmarket, \nfostering  of\ncompetition.\n\ntransparent  procedures,  nonpartisan  resolution  of  disputes,  and \n\n3. \n\nElectricity Rates to Agricultural Consumers\n\n42.\nCurrently, GEB charges a \u201cper horsepower installed\u201d flat tariff to its agricultural consumers.\nSince  there  is  no  incremental  charge  based  on  the  actual  withdrawal  of  energy,  there  is  no\n\n\f12\n\nincentive  to  conserve  electricity.  A  major  social  disbenefit  caused  by  this  scheme  is  the\nindiscriminate use of groundwater by farmers in the relatively dry northern districts of the State to\ngain  short-term  benefits  of  higher  cropping  yields  per  acre  through  multicropping  and  growing\nwater-intensive cash crops instead of the traditional dry area crops grown earlier. As a result, the\nwater  table  has  dropped  from  an  estimated  10-12  meters  (m)  below  ground  in  the  1970s  to  an\naverage of 150-200 m today and is dropping by an estimated 12 m every year. The water now\ncontains heavy traces of fluorides and other minerals, and it is feared that in two or three years the\nwater  may  turn  saline,  thereby  severely  and  permanently  damaging  soil  quality  and  eroding\nagricultural activity in the area. Lowering of the water table has also increased the consumption of\nelectricity per acre of irrigated land since more energy is required each year to pump up the same\nquantity of water. Hence, for the Sector Development Program, the issues of water conservation\nand  electricity  conservation  have  become  inextricably  linked.  ADB  Missions  visited  several\nissue  with  about\nvillages \n300 representatives of the farming community. The Missions' impression is that (i) many farmers\nin this district would not mind paying higher rates for electricity provided the quality and reliability\nof  power  supply  improved;  and  (ii) farmers  were  hoping  that  some  agency  will  show  them\nalternative techniques of conserving water while maintaining their current levels of production and\nincome.\n\nin  north  Gujarat  and  discussed \n\nin  Mahesana  district \n\nthe \n\n43.\nThe  only  option  available  that  would  fulfill  the  needs  of  water  and  energy  conservation,\nprotect  the  earnings  of  the  farmers  and  improve  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector  is  to  help\nfarmers  change  the  method  of  irrigation  from  the  present  \u201cflood  irrigation\u201d  technique  to  \u201cdrip\nirrigation\u201d which has been successfully practiced in dry areas such as Israel and southwest United\nStates.  Some  small  schemes  have  also  been  implemented  in  Rajasthan  and  Gujarat  with\nsuccess.  The  Program,  therefore,  includes  assistance  for  a  pilot  scheme  for  converting  of\nirrigation systems in Mahesana district.\n\n4. \n\nDelegation of Powers to Independent Profit Centers\n\n44. While  generation  and  transmission  are  activities  that  are  remote  from  the  end  users  of\nelectricity, distribution is closely linked to its consumers. Hence, for improvements to be effected in\nthis  segment,  effective  delegation  of  administrative  decision-making  needs  to  be  made  to  the\nmanagers  that  are  directly  responsible.  To  make  a  beginning  in  this  respect,  GEB  created  pilot\nindependent  profit  centers  at  Kheda  (Anand  circle)  and  Rajkot.  GEB  has  since  delegated  the\nfollowing  powers  to  the  superintending  engineers  (managers)  of  the  centers.  The  managers  of\neach center will be directly accountable for its performance and the manager and the staff will be\ngiven with incentives for good performance.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\nProcurement.  Materials  to  be  procured  by  GEB  headquarters  (HQ)  will  be  listed.\nExcept  for  items  on  this  list,  the  centers  will  be  allowed  to  procure  all  necessary\nmaterials  and  sufficient  financial  powers  will  be  delegated  for  such  procurement.\nFurther, there should be a maximum waiting time for supply of materials by GEB\n(HQ) to any indent from the centers, even for items on the list of materials to be\nprocured by GEB (HQ). If GEB (HQ) cannot satisfy the indent in a given time, or in\ncase  of  an  emergency,  the  centers  should  be  allowed  a  much  higher  level  of\nauthority to effect their own procurement.\n\nMoney  Transfers.  Based  on  the  approved  budget  for  the  year,  the  centers  will\nwithhold the required funds from their collections, instead of the present practice of\nsending in all money collected to GEB (HQ) and then having their funds transferred\nback. The centers will be debited for all electricity sold to them at 66 kV and also\nfor all the materials supplied to them by GEB (HQ). If any non-remunerative work is\n\n\f13\n\nrequested  to  be  undertaken  by  the  centers,  GEB  (HQ)  will  pay  for  the  works  as\nwell  as  the  differential  revenue  loss  to  the  centers  for  the  operation  and\nmaintenance of such schemes.\n\n(iii) \n\nPersonnel  matters.  Once  GEB  (HQ)  selects  the  superintending  engineers\n(managers)  of  the  centers,  they  will  not  be  transferred  or  recalled  until  they\ncomplete their tenures, except in the gravest of circumstances. Important postings\nof officers and staff to the centers will be made by GEB (HQ) only after consulting\nwith the concerned manager. Further, GEB (HQ) will withdraw from the centers all\nstaff  identified  by  the  managers  as  redundant,  undesirable  or  inefficient.  The\nmanagers will be provided an annual operations and maintenance budget, which\nmay be used for salaries or equipment and facilities. Further, managers will have\nthe flexibility to reorganize their divisions to extract more efficiencies and may even\ninterchange categories of staff.\n\n(iv)\n\nPriority.  GEB  will  give  priority  to  the  centers  for  all  support  as  well  as  for  reliable\npower supplies up to the extent of the electricity paid for by them.\n\n5. \n\nRationalization of Electricity Duty\n\nPrior  to  FY1998,  there  was  a  high  level  of  electricity  duty  on  GEB's  supplies  to  high\n45.\ntension  (HT)  and  low  tension  (LT)  industrial  consumers  (averaging  about  Re0.50  per  kWh)\nwhereas captive generators paid a much lower rate (averaging at about Re0.05 per kWh after a\nduty-free concession period of 10 years). This put GEB at a disadvantage in retaining its industrial\nconsumers, especially in the wake of the liberal licensing policies for captive generation adopted\nby  the  state,  which  provides  other  benefits  such  as  sales  tax  waivers  on  finished  products,  and\nhigher depreciation rates. Apart from cross-subsidization in the agriculture sector, the burden of\nwhich  was  principally  borne  by  GEB\u2019s  industrial  consumers,  this  was  the  main  factor  leading  to\nincreasing captive generation in Gujarat which has reached a sanctioned capacity of 3,100 MW\nas  of    31  March  2000.  The  State  Government  has  since  raised  the  rate  of  duty  on  electricity\nproduced by captive generators to Re0.2-0.4 per kWh and has agreed to reduce electricity duty\non GEB for its sales to its industrial consumers to make competition fair to GEB.\n\n6. \n\nGovernance\n\n46.\nTariff setting in the power sector in Gujarat has been heavily politicized, with agricultural\nconsumers  being  heavily  subsidized.  This  has  led  to  distortion  in  consumption  and  avoidable\nwastage  of  both  electricity  and  water.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  depoliticize  and  rationalize\ntariffs  if  the  sector's  operations  are  to  be  viable.  Competition  in  the  sector  has  also  been\nunstructured  and  loose  as  often  happens  in  a  near  monopoly.  Power  purchase  agreements\nhave  largely  been  negotiated  and  there  is  no  competition  among  similar  business  segments\nwithin  the  organization.  Management  of  the  sector  is  another  key  issue.  GEB's  management\n[other than its Member (Technical)] comprises political and bureaucratic deputies appointed by\nthe  State  Government.  Transfers  are  frequent  and  there  is  little  attempt  at  taking  long-term\nperspectives on organizational development and strategies. The solution to these governance-\nrelated  issues  is  to  (i) reorganize  the  sector  along  functional  lines;  (ii) appoint  an  independent\nregulatory  commission  to  set  tariffs  and  structure  competition  in  the  sector;  and  (iii) gradually\nreplace  appointees  of  the  State  Government  on  the  boards  of  management  of  the  sector\ncompanies  with  experts.  As  a  consequence  of  this  policy  dialogue,  the  State  Government\n(i) established  GERC  in  1998  under  the  Central  Acts,  (ii)  agreed  to  restructure  the  sector\ngenerally  along  functional  lines  either,  and  (iii)  agreed  to  progressively  professionalize  the\nmanagements of sector entities.\n\n\f14\n\n 72.9\n 20.0\n  56.9\n    7.8\n157.6\n\n  15.8\n    9.1\n  24.9\n\n  17.5\n\n200.0\n\nD. \n\nThe Investment Project\n\n1. \n\nProject Description\n\n47.\n\nThe investment project has four components (details are in Appendix 5):\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nPart A.

Of the various project\ncomponents, minor land acquisition and tree cutting are required only for transmission lines and\nsubstations. The Project has no long-term negative environmental impacts.\n\n51.\nDuring  Project  implementation,  GEB  will  submit  to  ADB  an  annual  report  consisting  of\n(i) monitoring results; and (ii) copies of permits, licenses, and clearances that may be issued by\nthe  Gujarat  State  Pollution  Control  Board  and  other  state  and  national  agencies  responsible  for\nenforcing of environmental safety regulation and standards. If any project component is cited for\nviolating laws or standards, the report will include a certification from the relevant agency that the\ndefect has been corrected or that a time-bound action plan for its correction has been accepted.\n\n52.\nNo  significant  rehabilitation  or  resettlement  is  required  for  the  Project.  Specific  Land\nAcquisition and Resettlement Plans (LARPs) to be applied by GEB (or its successor entities) to\ncompensate  those  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  drawn  up  for  each  component  during  project\nexecution since they can be determined only at the time of actual construction.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\nThe Sector Development Program is designed to promote economic growth by increasing\n53.\nelectricity supply in Gujarat, including the rural areas. It will provide a reliable and quality power\nsupply,  thereby  improving  industrialization.  As  a  result  of  faster  economic  growth  due  to  the\ngrowth  of  industry  and  commerce,  employment  opportunities  are  expected  to  expand,  thus\ncontributing  to  poverty  reduction.  Reliable  electricity  supply  will  also  enhance  education,  health,\nand other social infrastructure facilities directly and indirectly. Moreover, since the funds currently\nused to subsidize the power sector will be available for social sector users, the poor will directly be\nbenefited. Small residential consumers will not be affected since the tariff system incorporates has\na lifetime rate of Rs2.70 per kWh for the first 50 kWh of consumption.\n\n54.\nDuring  the  preparation  of  the  Sector  Development  Program,  GERC  held  consultations\nwith the major consumer groups and representatives, including farmers, household heads, and\nindustrialists.  While  their  views  on  the  tariff  structure  vary,  inefficiency  was  found  to  be  a\ncommon  concern.  Transparency  in  electricity  consumption  and  cross-subsidy  provision  was  a\nmajor  concern  of  industrial  and  household  consumers.  There  was  a  strong  demand  for  a\nplatform to continue the dialogue with GERC/GEB, and the need for educating consumers and\ntheir raising awareness was suggested. In addition to informing the consumer groups of reform\n\n\f16\n\nactions  and  their  implications,  and  seeking  feedback  from  them,  consumer  education  should\ninclude energy conservation and environmental concern.\n\n55.\nAmong the farmers\u2019 groups, water availability is the major concern. It was reported that\nthe water table in a village has been dropping an average of 4.5 to 6 m every year and the water\ntable is now 150-200 m below the ground compared with 60-75 m a decade ago. Farmers are\naware  of  water  scarcity  and  the  need  for  conservation;  however,  the  current  per  horsepower\ninstalled  flat  tariff  gives  them  little  incentive  to  conserve  water.  In  fact,  it  drives  them  to\nindiscriminate  use  of  groundwater.  This  causes  a  vicious  cycle  of  water  wastage  and\ndegradation.  Sole  dependence  on  the  tubewell  makes  it  difficult  for  farmers  to  diversify  their\nfarming. Therefore, the proposed pilot project on drip irrigation will have a positive outcome in\nterms of efficient water use and shift of cultivation to high-value crops.\n\n56.\nA  poverty  impact  assessment  is  given  in  Appendix  8.  Tariff  increase  on  agricultural\nconsumers  may  result  in  a  short-term  negative  impact.  However,  the  impact  on  the  small  and\nmarginal  farmers  may  not  be  serious,  since  at  present  these  farmers,  who  do  not  own  tube\nwells,  buy  water  from  large  farmers  at  a  high  rate.  The  richer  farmers  tend  to  control  water\nsupply  in  rural  areas,  and  the  small  and  marginal  farmers  do  not  necessarily  benefit  from  the\ncurrent  subsidies.  Rationalizing  the  tariff  structure  will  increase  efficiency,  and  will  give  end\nusers water  equitable access to water.  Overall, the Sector Development Program will have a\nbeneficial impact on the poor.\n\nV. \n\nTHE LOANS\n\nADB  will  provide  two  loans  totaling  $350  million  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources\n57.\n(OCR) to the Government, as the Borrower for forwarding to the State Government and GEB (or\nits successor entities with the prior approval of ADB). The loans will carry interest at the ADB\u2019s\npool-based  variable  lending  rate  for  US  dollar  loans,  and  will  also  be  subject  to  a  1  percent\nfront-end  fee,  as  well  as  applicable  commitment  charges  in  accordance  with  ADB's  policy  on\nOCR  loans.  The  loans  are  (i)  a  Program  Loan  of  $150  million  with  a  maturity  of  15  years\nincluding a grace period of 3 years, to be disbursed in three equal tranches of $50 million each\nupon compliance with policy conditions as specified in paras. 65-67, and (ii) a Project Loan of\n$200 million with a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period.\n\nA. \n\nThe Program Loan\n\n1. \n\nAmount, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n\n58.\nThe  Program  Loan  of  $150  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB's  OCR  resources.  The\ncounterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the\nGovernment  to the State Government under normal arrangements for the transfer of external\nassistance. The funds transferred to the State Government will be treated as \u201cadditional\u201d to the\nGovernment's transfers allocated annually to the State Government. The Government will bear\nthe foreign exchange risk on the loan.\n\nThe  State  Government  is  expected  to  incur  the  following  costs  of  adjustments  over  the\n\n59.\nreform period.\n\n(i) \n\nRationalizing  of  electricity  duty  is  expected  to  cause  a  revenue  loss  of  about\nRs1,500  million  ($33  million)  each  year  in  the  next  five  years  for  a  total  of\n$165 million.\n\n\f17\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nLong-term loans to GEB to retire expensive commercial debt and adjust IPP prices\nwill be about Rs2,000 million ($43 million).\n\nPayment of arrears  of dues of municipalities and other local bodies until FY2000\nwill  cost  about  Rs700  million  ($15  million).  It  is  expected  that  in  FY2001,  an\nadditional $5 million may be required.\n\nAbout 700,000 consumer meters will be procured and installed over the next three\nyears. While the meters will be procured under the Project, their installation will be\nfinanced by the State Government. At $10 per meter, this works out to $7 million.\n\n60.\nThe  total  cost  of  adjustment  to  be  incurred  by  the  State  Government  over  the  reform\nperiod is estimated at $235 million. It is felt that the Program Loan of $150 million is adequate and\njustified considering the cost of adjustments incurred by the State Government on account of the\nreforms and the political costs it will incur during implementation.\n\n2. \n\nExecuting Agencies\n\nThe  Executing  Agencies  will  be  the  Finance  Department  and  the  Energy  and\n\n61.\nPetrochemicals Department of the State Government.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n62.\nThe  proceeds  of  the  Program  Loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange\ncosts  (excluding  the  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  imports  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s\nmember  countries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  9)  and\nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All  procurement  will  be  through\nnormal  commercial  practices  in  case  of  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  prescribed\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  in  the  case  of  procurement  by  the  public  sector,  having  due\nregard for the principles of economy and efficiency.\n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n63.\nCounterpart  funds  generated  by  the  Program  Loan  will  be  transferred  by  the\nGovernment  to  the  State  Government  and  will  be  used  by  the  State  Government  under\narrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the financial restructuring of GEB and adjustment\ncosts associated with the Sector Development Program, including (i) reduction of the accounts\npayable  of  GEB  to  power  producers  and  suppliers  of  fuel  and  transport,  (ii) retirement  of  the\nexpensive  commercial  debt  of  GEB, \n(iii)  payment  of  outstanding  municipal  dues,\n(iv) rationalization of electricity duty, and (v) reduction of IPP tariffs through buyout of debt.\n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\na. \n\nTranche 1: $50 million\n\nThe first tranche of $50 million of the Program Loan will be released upon fulfillment of\n\n64.\nthe following actions. This release is anticipated in December 2000.\n\nestablishment of the GERC;\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\napproval of the Gujarat Electricity Industry (Reorganization and Regulation) Bill,\n2000  (the    Bill)  by  the  State  Government\u2019s  Cabinet,  and  its  submission  by  the\nState Government to the Government for its approval;\n\n\f18\n\n(iv) \n\nfirst tariff award by GERC;\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\nincorporation  and  establishment  of  Gujarat  State  Electricity  Company  Limited\n(GSECL)  and  Gujarat  Energy  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GETCL).\nConstitution  of  their  boards  of  directors,  with  at  least  two  directors  being  from\nnon-governmental sector who are experts in their related fields;\n\ncirculation  by  GEB  of  a  draft  action  plan  to  meter  all  consumers  for  consumer\nconsultation, in accordance with GERC\u2019s order of 10 October 2000;\n\napproval  by  the  State  Government  of  the  structure,  human  resources,  and\nbudget of GERC for the next five years; and\n\n(viii) \n\npayment by the State Government of all municipality dues owed to GEB up to 31\nMarch 2000.\n\nb. \n\nTranche 2: $50 million\n\nThe second tranche of $50 million of the Program Loan will be released upon fulfillment\n\n65.\nof the following actions. This release is anticipated in June 2001.\n\ntransfer of Gandhinagar and Utran power stations from GEB to GSECL;\n\noffset of subsidy and subvention arrears owed by the State Government to GEB\nuntil 31 March 2000, and payment of outstanding municipality dues by the State\nGovernment to GEB until 31 March 2001;\n\n(iii) \n\nintroduction of the Bill in the Gujarat State Assembly for its consideration;\n\nrationalization and reduction of electricity duty in the State Government\u2019s budget\nfor FY2002, in an amount not less than Rs1,500 million; and\n\nfiling by GEB before GERC of the action plan to meter all consumers in the state,\nin a phase manner over a period of three years from 10 October 2000, the date\nof GERC' first tariff award.\n\nc. \n\nTranche 3: $50 million\n\nThe third tranche of $50 million of the Program Loan will be released upon fulfillment of\n\n66.\nthe following actions. This release is anticipated in June 2002.\n\ntransfer of transmission assets from GEB to GETCL;\n\nthe\nagreement  between \nReorganization  Plan  for  GEB  and  solicitation  for  privatization  of  at  least  one\nidentified distribution area of GEB, unless contrary to the Reorganization plan;\n\nthe  State  Government,  GEB,  and  ADB  on \n\nthe  rules  and  regulations  under  the  Bill  as  enacted  (the  Act)  laid  before  the\nGujarat State Assembly and published in the Official Gazette;\n\n(iv)\n\nsecond tariff submission by GEB to GERC; and\n\n\f19\n\n(vi) \n\nestablishment and operationalization of GERC under the Act.\n\nB. \n\nThe Project Loan\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n67.\nThe Project Loan of $200 million will be provided from ADB's OCR resources. The loan\nproceeds  will  be  transferred  by  the  Government  to  the  State  Government  under  normal\narrangements for transfer of such external assistance and will be treated as \u201cadditional\u201d to the\nGovernment\u2019s normal transfers to the State Government. The State Government will onlend the\nloan proceeds to GEB, under a subsidiary loan agreement, at an interest rate of 12 percent per\nannum  with  a  term  of  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  The  interest  rate  of\n12 percent  per  annum  is  in  line  with  the  interest  being  charged  by  commercial  institutions  in\nIndia for lending to power utilities. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on the\nProject Loan.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n68.\nGEB (or its successor entities with prior agreement of ADB) will be the Executing Agency\nfor the Project. Separate groups have been created in GEB to implement the project components.\nGEB assisted by its Planning Group will monitor the implementation of Project components on a\nquarterly basis and direct suitable action as may be required to support the implementing groups.\nSince GEB has no expertise in formulating and executing drip irrigation systems, it will seek the\nsupport  of  the  Water  Resources  Engineering  and  Management  Institute  of  the  University  at\nBaroda,  or  other  consultants  who  have  had  experience  in  implementing  such  systems.  For\nbeneficiary participation during implementation, a review committee comprising representatives of\nthe State Government, GEB, the consultant, and the village leaders/farmers will be constituted.\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Performance Review\n\n69.\nProject  Implementation  will  commence  in  January  2001  and  be  completed  in  December\n2004  (Appendix  10).  Direct  supervision  of  implementation  and  monitoring  the  operational\nperformance of the components will be the responsibility of GEB, which will submit semi-annual\nprogress reports to the State Government and ADB within 30 days from the end of each half-year.\nADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and meet\nwith  GEB,  the  State  Government,  and  the  Government  at  least  semiannually  to  discuss  Project\nprogress.  ADB  will  also  monitor  the  overall  financial  and  technical  performance  of  the  state\u2019s\npower sector, and the State Government's fiscal position.\n\n4. \n\nProcurement\n\nADB financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\n70.\nfor Procurement.  For  such  procurement,  bidding  documents  will  be  prepared  in  a  manner  to\nensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding (ICB). Each supply contract\nestimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Each\ncontract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of\ninternational shopping. ADB's funds will not be used to fund procurement under local competitive\nbidding  procedures.  A list  of  the  major  contract  packages  under  the  Project  with  their  cost\nestimates  is  in  Appendix  11.  Advance  procurement  action  has  been  allowed  and  about  six\ncontract packages with a  total bid value of $105 million will be approved for bidding by December\n2000. Retroactive financing has not been allowed.\n\n\f5. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n20\n\n71.\nFor  the  drip  irrigation  component,  GEB  will  appoint  within  three  months  of  loan\neffectiveness, the Water Resources Engineering and Management Institute of the MS University\nat  Baroda  or  any  other  competent  consultant,  under  its  own  financing,  to  design  drip  irrigation\nsystems  for  the  areas  identified,  prepare  specifications  for  the  materials  to  be  procured,\ncoordinate  with  GEB  for  procurement,  oversee  installation,  and  provide  post  installation\nmonitoring and assistance to GEB and the farmers for two years. Since these services are being\nfinanced entirely by GEB, ADB's guidelines for selection of consultants will not apply.\n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nSince  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  supply  of  goods,  ADB's\n\n72.\ncommitment and direct payment procedures will be used for disbursement purposes.\n\n7. \n\nReports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n\nGEB  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  its  respective  components  and  submit\n73.\nthem to ADB on a semi-annual basis within 30 days of the end of each half-year. The reports will\nbe  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  to  the  implementation\nschedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  the  performance  of  the  project  implementation\nconsultants,  and  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  upcoming  period.  The  reports  will  include  a\nsummary  financial  account  for  the  Project  consisting  of  project  expenditures  during  the  period,\nyear to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of\nthe  Project  based  on  these  reports  and  meet  with  the  Executing  Agencies  and  the  State\nGovernment at least semiannually to discuss progress of the Project. Completion reports will be\nsubmitted to ADB within three months of Project completion.\n\n74.\nGEB  will  have  its  annual  financial  statements,  including  the  income  statement,  balance\nsheet,  and  sources  and  application  of  funds  statement,  audited  by  a  professional  auditing  firm\nacceptable to ADB. Audited statements will be submitted to ADB within nine months of the close\nof  the  financial  year.  GEB  will  also  submit  to  ADB  audited  project  accounts  and  the  auditors'\nobservations with respect to compliance with the loan covenants.\n\nC. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n1. \n\nResponsibilities\n\n75.\nGEB  is  a  statutory  body  created  under  the  Indian  Electricity  (Supply)  Act  of  1948.  Its\nobjectives are to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity in the state of Gujarat except in those\nareas  licensed  to  other  distributors.  Over  the  years,  GEB  also  promoted  organizations  in  the\npower  sector  in  Gujarat  such  as  the  Gujarat  Power  Corporation  (50 percent  share)  and  the\nGujarat  Industrial  Power  Corporation  (about  25  percent  share).  In  addition,  GEB  supports  the\nState Government in the sector through assistance on sector development plans and safety and\ninspection functions.\n\n2. \n\nOrganization Structure\n\n76.\nGEB is governed by a board appointed by the State Government comprising a full-time\nchairperson  and  three  full-time  members  for  technical,  financial,  and  administrative  functions\n(Appendix 12).\n\n\fa. \n\nPast Financial Performance\n\n21\n\n77.\nGEB\u2019s  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  cash  flow  statement,  both  past  and\nprojected, are given in Appendix 13.

However, net income before subsidy has been negative mainly due to the heavily\nsubsidized  agriculture  tariff.  Agricultural  consumers,  the  largest  consumer  category  of  GEB\u2019s\nsales mix, were charged only Re0.15 per kWh, which is less than one tenth of the cost of power\nin FY2000.\n\n\f22\n\nIn FY2000, GEB\u2019s profitability continued to decline mainly because (i) the average cost\n79.\nof power purchases significantly increased from Rs2.41per kWh to Rs2.59 per kWh, (ii) share of\npower purchase from non-GEB generation increased from 41.2 percent to 46.6 percent, and (iii)\nretail tariffs had not been raised since May 1993 despite the increase in the cost of power. In\nOctober  1996,  tariffs  were  increased  for  limited  consumer  categories:  industrial  (LT)  by\n10 percent, industrial (HT) by 28 percent, railway by 31 percent, and Bulk by 11 percent. As a\nresult,  net  deficit  before  subsidy  reached  Rs35.6  billion  in  FY2000.  With    subsidy,  GEB  has\nbeen allowed to calculate only a zero percent rate of return on net fixed assets and not the three\npercent rate of return as stipulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948.\n\n80.\nThe  profit  and  net  income  figures  of  GEB  continue  to  deteriorate  far  below  the  break-\neven  point.  The  usual  calculation  of  financial  ratios  has  been  abandoned  due  to  its  lack  of\nrelevant numbers; both the debt service coverage ratio and self-financing ratio are negative.\n\nb. \n\nProjected Financial Performance\n\nGEB\u2019s    projected  financial    performance  is  summarized  in  Table  7.  With  the  reform\n81.\nmeasures  to  be  implemented  under  the  Sector  Development  Program,  GEB's  financial\nperformance is expected to improve significantly in the coming years. While the actual levels of\ntariffs  will  be  set  by  the  GERC,  the  minimum  cost  recovery  requirements  set  by  the  Bill  will\nfavorably influence tariff awards by GERC. The compulsory metering of all consumers will help\nreduce  unaccounted  for  sales  of  energy.  Rationalization  and  reduction  in  electricity  duty  are\nexpected  to  halt  further  deterioration  of  consumer  mix.  On  the  other  hand,  due  to  the  state's\nbudget constraints, subsidy to GEB is being capped at Rs11,000 million every year. As a result,\na substantial tariff increase is necessary for the heavily subsidized agriculture consumers.\n\nTable 7: Summary of GEB\u2019s Projected Financial Performance\n(Rs million)\n\nItem\nPower  Generation\nPurchase\n\n& \n(GWh)\n\nT & D Losses (%)\nSales\nPower \n\n(GWh)\n\nSales Revenue\nGross Profit\nNet \n\nIncome\nBefore Subsidy\nNet  Income  After\n\nSubsidy\n\nSubsidy\nNet Fixed Assets\nLong-Term Loans\nFunds  from  State\nGovernment\nROR on Net Fixed\n\nAssets (%)\nDebt Service\n Coverage  Ratio\n\n(times)\n\nFY2001\n\nFY2002\n\nFY2003\n\nFY2004\n\nFY2005\n\nFY2006\n\nFY2007\n\nFY2008\n\nFY2009\n\n45,040\n\n45,758\n\n46,451\n\n47,278\n\n49,655\n\n52,564\n\n56,050\n\n59,831\n\n63,936\n\n30.0\n31,528\n\n26.0\n33,861\n\n23.0\n35,767\n\n20.0\n37,822\n\n71,544\n(9,166)\n(31,800)\n\n92,344\n(1,731)\n(26,132)\n\n109,831\n4,408\n(20,159)\n\n125,042\n10,176\n(14,804)\n\n19.0\n40,221\n\n140,662\n8,125\n(17,115)\n\n18.0\n43,102\n\n158,578\n9,853\n(18,227)\n\n18.0\n45,961\n\n18.0\n49,062\n\n18.0\n52,428\n\n176,205\n9,471\n(19,120)\n\n195,666\n16,061\n(13,255)\n\n217,563\n24,078\n(4,508)\n\n(18,640)\n\n(15,132)\n\n(9,159)\n\n(3,804)\n\n(6,115)\n\n(7,227)\n\n(8,120)\n\n(2,255)\n\n6,492\n\n11,000\n84,075\n39,727\n44,077\n\n11,000\n74,751\n40,539\n47,967\n\n11,000\n74,964\n42,124\n47,967\n\n11,000\n70,859\n45,738\n47,967\n\n11,000\n63,935\n44,300\n47,967\n\n11,000\n58,496\n42,972\n47,967\n\n(39.7)\n\n(31.0)\n\n(16.6)\n\n(11.8)\n\n(14.3)\n\n(16.9)\n\n(0.2)\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n11,000\n74,236\n44,416\n47,967\n\n(7.2)\n\n0.7\n\n11,000\n52,941\n41,644\n47,967\n\n(5.3)\n\n0.9\n\n11,000\n47,270\n40,316\n47,967\n\n17.7\n\n1.3\n\nSource: staff estimates\n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, ROR = rate of return, T&D = transmission and distribution.\n\n\f23\n\nThe projected average retail tariff per kWh for each consumer category is presented in\n82.\nTable  8.  The  projected  tariff  increases  are  necessary  for  GEB  to  recover  from  its  current\nfinancial  position  and  to  become  a  financially  sound  corporation  by  FY2009.  The  first  tariff\naward  given  by  GERC  in  October  2000  was  very  encouraging  in  this  regard.  The  agriculture\ntariff  was  increased  from  Re0.15  per  kWh  to  approximately  Re0.80  per  kWh.  It  is  anticipated\nthat  GERC  will  continue  to  fulfill  its  mandate  of  ensuring  a  sustainable  electricity  sector  in\nGujarat, in terms of both efficiency and financial soundness.\n\nTable 8: Average Cost of Power and Category-wise Tariff\n(Rs/kWh, excluding electricity duty and sales tax)\n\nFY2000 FY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009\n(Proj)\n(Prov)\n4.02\n1.79\n\n(Budget)\n2.20\n\n(Proj)\n3.71\n\n(Proj)\n3.86\n\n(Proj)\n2.42\n\n(Proj)\n3.20\n\n(Proj)\n2.97\n\n(Proj)\n3.56\n\n(Proj)\n3.39\n\n2.19\n\n4.05\n3.70\n4.17\n2.74\n4.70\n0.80\n1.29\n\n2.42\n\n2.41\n\n4.46\n4.07\n4.59\n3.01\n5.00\n1.00\n1.42\n\n2.66\n\n2.53\n\n4.68\n4.27\n4.82\n3.16\n5.00\n1.15\n1.49\n\n2.80\n\n2.66\n\n4.91\n4.49\n5.00\n3.32\n5.00\n1.32\n1.56\n\n2.93\n\n2.79\n\n5.00\n4.71\n5.00\n3.49\n5.00\n1.52\n1.64\n\n3.08\n\n2.93\n\n5.00\n4.95\n5.00\n3.66\n5.00\n1.75\n1.72\n\n3.24\n\n3.07\n\n5.00\n5.00\n5.00\n3.85\n5.00\n2.01\n1.81\n\n3.40\n\n3.23\n\n5.00\n5.00\n5.00\n4.04\n5.00\n2.31\n1.90\n\n3.57\n\n3.39\n\n5.00\n5.00\n5.00\n4.24\n5.00\n2.6\n2.00\n\n3.75\n\nOverall  Average\nRetail Tariff\n\nDomestic/\n\nResidential\n\nCommercial\nIndustrial (LT)\nIndustrial (HT)\nPublic Lighting\nRailways\nAgriculture a\nPublic Water\nWorks\nBulk Supply\n\n2.10\n\n3.84\n3.49\n4.09\n2.63\n4.63\n0.15\n1.24\n\n2.36\n\nSource: Staff estimates\n\nHT = high tension,  LT = low tension, Prov. = Provisional,  Proj. = Projected\n\na  The agriculture tariff shown is net of subsidies. With subsidies, the legal requirement of covering 67 per cent of cost\n\nof supply is met  from FY2003 onwards.\n\n83.\nThe financial projections in Table 7 and Appendix 13 present a likely scenario during the\nProgram period. It includes accounting for possible slippages in the metering program, resulting\nin  a  slower  rate  of  reclassification  of  consumption  from  agricultural  to  other  categories,  and  a\nslower increase  in the tariff for agricultural consumers than that mandated by law. To achieve\nthe  results  shown,  GEB  needs  to  improve  both  its  technical  operations  and  financial\nmanagement.  The financial results also depend on GERC continuing with modest annual tariff\nincreases  of  about  10  percent  for  each  category.  This  scenario,  including  the  State\nGovernment's subsidies, is fully consistent with the medium-term fiscal consolidation plan of the\nState Government for achieving sustainability of the public finances.\n\n84.\nA higher performance scenario is indeed feasible if three specific actions take place. If (i)\nthe large number of meters required to meter all consumers are bought and installed during a\nthree-year  period  as  mandated  by  the  Act;  (ii)  as  a  result  of  the  metering  and  consequent\nreclassification  of  consumers,  agricultural  consumption,  as  a  percentage  of  total  consumption,\ndecreases from the existing 43 percent to 25 percent, and the consumption above 25 percent is\nreclassified on an equal basis among the domestic, commercial, and LT industrial consumers;\nand  (iii)  bold  annual  actions  are  taken  by  GERC  on  agricultural  tariff  increases  to  achieve\n67 percent  of  cost  of  supply  by  FY2006  without  subsidies,  GEB  will  achieve  a  positive  net\nincome  (without  subsidies)  of  Rs2,340  million  in  FY2004.    This  means  that  from  FY2004\nonward, the annual subsidy of Rs11,000 million could be fully phased out, or, alternatively, the\n\n\ftariff for supply to industry and commercial sectors decreased. In this more optimistic scenario,\nreduction in budgetary subsidies could be achieved even earlier.\n\n24\n\nVI. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n1. \n\nReorganization Plan for GEB\n\na. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nADB  and  the  State  Government  have  discussed  and  agreed  that  there  are  several\n85.\nmodels  that  could  be  applied  for  restructuring  of  GEB.  All  have  merits  and  demerits.  The\nfollowing common aspects of restructuring were agreed to by both sides.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\nOne generation company (GSECL) has been created to which all units of GEB\u2019s\nGandhinagar  thermal  power  station  and  Utran  thermal  power  station  will  be\ntransferred within six months of the date of Loan approval.\n\nA statewide transmission company (GETCL) has been created (incorporated but\nyet to be operationalized). GEB\u2019s transmission assets pertaining to voltage levels\nof 66 kV and above will be transferred to GETCL within the first year after Loan\napproval.\n\nthe  State  Government,  GEB,  and  ADB  will  jointly  develop  the  model  for\nrestructuring under a reorganization plan, before the release of the third tranche\nof  the  Program  component  of  the  Sector  Development  Program  Loan.  This  is\nexpected  to  be  completed  within  18  months  after  the  date  of  Loan  approval.\nFurther, work needs to be done to finalize the model: (a) segregating the assets\nand liabilities for the identified distribution areas; (b) establishing the tariffs to be\ncharged  to  consumers  in  each  distribution  area  based  on  a  range  of  consumer\nmix  and  generation  scenarios;  and  (c) developing  a  mechanism  for  addressing\nsubsidies within and across distribution areas. The suitability of each model will\nbe  judged  against  such  criteria  as  (a) efficiency  of  delivery,  (b)  maximizing  the\nbenefits  of  competition,  (c) least  cost  to  the  consumers,  and  (d)  maximizing\ncontribution  to  sustainable  public  finances  by  lowering  subsidies  and  limiting\ncross-subsidies.\n\nADB will provide TA to (i) help establish the optimal model for the sector structure and\n86.\nprepare a reorganization plan; (ii) identify the distribution area for privatization, or other modes\nof reorganization as recommended by the plan; (iii) conduct the necessary studies and prepare\nthe documents necessary for inviting bidders; and (iv) help in evaluating the offers received for\npurchase  of  shares  in  the  distribution  entity.    The  TA  will  also  assist  in  matters  relating  to\n(i) rationalization  of  GEB\u2019s  personnel;  (ii) unfunded  liabilities  of  GEB;  and  (iii)  costs  of\nadjustments.  It  is  agreed  that  all  privatization  and  reorganization  will  be  done  in  an  open,\ncompetitive, and transparent manner. Outline terms of reference for the TA and cost estimates\nare given in Appendix 14.\n\nb. \n\nImplementing Arrangements\n\nThe TA will be implemented starting March 2001 and be completed in 18 months. The\n87.\nState Government and GEB will be the Executing Agencies. Formulating the reorganization plan\nwith all its associated studies will be completed within the first six months after consultants are\nappointed.  Workshops  for  sensitizing  GEB  staff  will  also  be  completed  within  this  period.\n\n\f25\n\nImmediately  thereafter,  implementation  will  start.  If  so  indicated  under  the  plan,  the  first\ndistribution area will be privatized shortly thereafter.\n\nc. \n\nReporting Requirements\n\nThe  consultants  will  submit  the  following  reports  to  the  State  Government,  GEB  and\n\n88.\nADB:\n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\ninception report within four weeks after the start  of the TA. In addition to outlining\na  detailed  work  program  and  describing  the  work  steps  proposed  to  fulfill  the\nterms  of  reference,  the  report  will  outline  the  approaches  to  be  adopted  in\nreorganizing public enterprises.\n\ninterim report within 2 months of the start of consulting services.  This will include\nthe  preliminary  blueprints  for  reorganizing  and  divestment  of  shares  in  public\nsector companies including the required financial and labor reorganization.  The\nreport  will  also  outline  the  arrangements  for  the  workshop  and  the  training  and\ninformation  seminars  to  be  conducted.  After  a  review  of  the  interim  report,  the\nState Government, GEB, ADB, and the team of consultants will meet to discuss\nprogress  under \nthe\nworkshop/seminars.\n\nthe  arrangements \n\nthe  TA  and \n\nfinalize \n\nfor \n\nto \n\nDraft  final  report  on  the  reorganization  plan  within  four  months  of  the  start  of\nconsulting  services.    This  report  will  include  the  consultants\u2019  findings  and\nrecommendations on reorganizing, divestment and public enterprises, details on\nmeasures  already  implemented  and  their  impact,  as  well  as  feedback  from  the\nconsultants\u2019 participation in the seminars. The report will also outline the strategy\nto  foster  private  sector  enterprise  development.  The  recommendations  of  the\ndraft final report will be discussed at a meeting between the State Government,\nGEB, ADB and the consultants. The final report, incorporating the comments of\nthe State Government, GEB, and ADB, will be prepared within two weeks of the\nmeeting.\n\n(iv) \n\nIf consistent with the reorganizing strategy as proposed in the final report on the\nreorganization  plan,  the  Consultants  will  prepare  documents  for  inviting  private\nsector  participation  in  one  distribution  area  of  Gujarat,  within  one  month  of  the\napproval of the Report. The document will include (a) prequalification documents\nwith the associated evaluation criteria and bid form; and (b) bid documents with\nassociated evaluation criteria and bid form.\n\n(v) \n\nEvaluation reports of the bidding at each stage of the process.\n\nd. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nIt  is  anticipated  that  24  person-months  of  consulting  services  (9  international  and  15\n89.\ndomestic) will be required over 18 months.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $770,000\nequivalent, comprising $500,000 in foreign exchange and $270,000 equivalent in local currency.\nADB  will  finance  $600,000,  consisting  of  the  entire  foreign  exchange  portion  of  the  costs  and\n$100,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  GEB  will  finance  a\nlocal currency cost of $170,000 equivalent that will include provision of the counterpart facilities\n(para. 91).\n\n\f26\n\ne. \n\nCounterpart Facilities\n\n90.\n\nGEB will provide counterpart facilities to the TA consultants as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nInternet connection,\nlocal telephone, fax connection,\nphotocopying facilities,\ntransport within Gujarat,\noffice accommodation with secretarial staff support,\nvenue and services for workshops and seminars, and\ncounterpart staff for conducting surveys, preparation of literature, etc.\n\n2. \n\nConsumer Awareness and Participation in Power Sector Reforms\n\na. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n91.\nThere  was  a  felt  need  to  educate  consumer  groups  and,  through  them,  the  general\npublic, regarding the changes being introduced in the sector. After consultations with the State\nGovernment,  GEB  and  several  consumer  groups,  it  was  agreed  that  ADB  would  fund  TA  to\nfacilitate  consumer  awareness  and  participation  in  power  sector  reforms.  The  TA  will  fund  a\ncoordination  group  of  consumers\u2019  representative  bodies  (tentatively  named  as  the  Electricity\nConsumers Coordination Forum or ECCF)  that would meet periodically to be informed by the\nState Government and GEB of reform actions taken and their implications for consumers, and to\nseek feedback from them. These representatives would then hold seminars to disseminate the\ninformation  and  views  to  their  members.  Direct  access  to  the  public,  through  the  media,  may\nalso be necessary to broaden understanding of the reforms.  The terms reference for the TA are\ngiven in Appendix 15.\n\nb. \n\nImplementing Arrangements\n\n92.\nThe  TA  will  commence  in  February  2001  and  be  completed  one  year  thereafter.  The\nConfederation of Indian Industry-Gujarat Chapter (CII) will act as the organizer and secretariat\nfor the ECCF and be Executing Agency for the TA. For each workshop to be funded under the\nTA,  ECCF,  through  CII,  will  forward  to  ADB  its  proposal  for  the  workshop,  indicating  (i)  the\nvenue and other arrangements; (ii) the likely participants amongst consumer groups and other\nstakeholders; (iii) experts, if any, to be invited to address the workshop; and (iv) a summary of\ncosts  to  be  incurred.  ADB  will  indicate  its  concurrence  with  the  proposal  with  suggestions  for\npossible changes, if so desired. At the conclusion of each workshop ECCF will submit a short\nreport  on  (i)  its  salient  conclusions;  (ii) materials  prepared  to  disseminate  its  conclusions;  and\n(iii) a detailed account of the expenditure pertaining to the items financed by ADB under the TA.\n\nc. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nThe total cost of the TA will be $ 65,000 equivalent, of which $30,000 will be in foreign\n93.\nexchange  and  $35,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  fund  from  the  ADB-funded  TA\nprogram, the entire foreign exchange cost plus $20,000 equivalent in local currency for a total of\n$50,000 equivalent. ECCF will finance the balance of $15,000. Cost estimates are in Appendix\n15.\n\n\f27\n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Facilities\n\n94.\nThe  non-governmental  organizations  constituting  ECCF  will  provide  all  personnel\nrequired  to  support  the  ECCF,  free  of  cost  to  the  ECCF.  CII  will  also  provide,  free  of  cost  to\nECCF,  day-to-day  secretarial  and  communications  assistance,  for  which  a  lump  sum\nreimbursement of $1,000 per quarter, will be considered under the TA.\n\n3. \n\nSupport to GERC\n\na. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n95.\n ADB and the State Government have agreed on the need to support GERC during the\ninitial phase of its establishment and operation to enable it to prepare key rules and regulations\nunder the Act. Outline terms of reference for the TA are given in Appendix 16.\n\nb. \n\nImplementing Arrangements\n\n96.\nThe TA will be implemented starting February 2001 and be completed in 18 months. Full\noperationalization  of  GERC,  including  drafting  of  all  required  codes,  rules,  regulations  and\nprocedures,  will  be  completed  within  the  first  six  months  after  consultants  are  appointed.  The\nworkshop for GERC and utilities staff should also be completed within this period. External and\nin-house training and operational support to GERC will end after one year.\n\n As a first step, key regulations and codes, which are required immediately after passing\n97.\nof the Act and a tariff and regulations concept paper will be drafted. The draft regulations and\ncodes  and  the  tariff  concept  paper  will  be  discussed  in  a  workshop  comprising  of  a  wide-\nselection  of  stakeholders  in  the  sector.  After  the  workshop,  GERC  will  give  the  consultants\ndetailed comments, based on which the regulations will be finalized.\n\n98.\nParallel with the drafting of regulations, a training needs analysis will be undertaken for\nGERC\u2019s staff on the basis of which an appropriate external and in\u2013house training program will\nbe  developed.  The  final  external  training  program,  indicating  objectives,  duration,  cost\nestimates, and staff who should attend, will be discussed and agreed upon with ADB before its\nimplementation.  The  in-house  training  program  will  complement  the  external  training  program\nand will include presentations by staff who have participated/will participate in external training.\n\n99.\nThe  external  training  program  will  be  implemented  after  the  first  draft  of  regulations  is\ncompleted. At such time, the training participants will have already gained a deeper appreciation\nof  the  key  elements  of  the  role  of  GERC,  the  different  pricing  concepts  and  their  implications\nand alternative structures of power sector regulation. The lessons from external training will be\ndisseminated by the training participants through a series of workshops and seminars for other\nGERC staff as well as other sector stakeholders.\n\n100. Operational  support  to  GERC  will  be  provided  in  parallel  with  the  drafting  of  the  key\nregulations.  The  contribution  of  GERC  staff  to  the  final  drafting  of  key  regulations  and  of\nsecondary  regulations  will  reflect \nincreased  sense  of  ownership  and  operational\nunderstanding  of  the  regulatory  framework  following  external  training.  The  workshops  bringing\ntogether a broad segment of sector participants will also contribute to more transparency in the\nregulatory process and thus, to a broader acceptance of the role and independence of GERC.\n\nthe \n\n\fc. \n\nReporting\n\n28\n\n101. A list of key deliverables will be produced under the TA:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n(vi)\n\nregulatory procedures,\nrules for the regulatory commission,\ntransmission and distribution licenses,\ncodes and standards,\ntariff and regulations concept paper, and\nscheme and training needs analysis.\n\nd. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n102.\nIt is anticipated that the TA will require a total of 10 person-months of consultants\u2019 input\nover  18 months.  The  team  of  consultants  (person-months  are  in  parenthesis)  include  an\ninternational  lawyer  (3),  technical  expert  (3),  tariff  and  commercial  expert  (3),  and  a  human\nresources development expert (1). The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent,\ncomprising  $450,000  in  foreign  exchange  and  $150,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will\nfinance $450,000, consisting of the entire foreign exchange portion of the costs from the ADB-\nfunded  TA  program.  GERC  will  finance  the  local  currency  cost  of  $150,000  equivalent  in  kind\nthrough counterpart facilities (para. 103).\n\ne.\n\nCounterpart Facilities\n\n103. GERC will provide counterpart facilities to the TA consultants as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nInternet connection,\nlocal telephone, fax connection,\nphotocopying facilities,\ntansport within Gujarat,\noffice accommodation with secretarial staff support,\nvenue and services for workshops and seminars, and\ndomestic consultants for conducting surveys, preparation of literature, etc.\n\n4. \n\nSupport to Distribution Profit Centers\n\nits\n104. GEB  expressed  a  requirement \nsuperintending  engineers  who  are  the  managers  of  its  Kheda  and  Rajkot  distribution  circles  as\nwell  as  for  their  immediate  subordinates  who  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  distribution\ndivisions  in  these  circles.  ADB  has  sought  the  assistance  of  bilateral  cofinanciers  who  are\ninterested  in  organizing  such  training  from  reputed  electricity  distribution  companies  in  their\ncountries.\n\nfor  medium-term  multidisciplinary \n\ntraining  of \n\nVII. \n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n105.\nFinancial evaluation was undertaken for components A, B, and C together since they are\nrelated,  and  separately  for  component  D  because  of  its  \u201cstand-alone\u201d  nature.  The  financial\ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  each  project  component  is  satisfactory  compared  with  GEB\u2019s\nweighted  average  real  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  6.2  percent.    The  FIRR  for  each  individual\n\n\fsubproject and the sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 9. The major assumptions used\nin the financial evaluation of the Project and detailed calculations are in Appendix 17.\n\n29\n\nTable 9: Sensitivity Analysis of the Financial Internal Rate of Return\n\nComponents A, B, and C\n\nComponent D\n\nScenario\nBase Case\na. 10% Increase in Capital Cost\nb.

The  likelihood  of  this  event-taking  place  is  minimal  since  the  GERC  has  been\nestablished and is mandated to award tariffs as per the Act. The FIRR does react negatively to\na 10 percent increase in the capital cost and a one-year delay in project completion. However,\nthe reduction in the FIRR does not go below the WACC of 6.2 percent. Accordingly, the Project\ncomponents  are  financially  sound  to  withstand  such  exigencies.  The  drip  irrigation  component\nhas proven to withstand all sensitivities tested due to its robust base FIRR.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n107. As part of its private power generation policy, the Government has invited private sector\ninvestment to increase generation capacity in Gujarat. Proposals have been solicited for about\n4,400 MW of generating capacity on a build-own-operate basis. A number of power purchasing\nagreements have been signed, among which are those for the Reliance and Akrimota IPPs with\na combined capacity of 750 MW. For evacuation of power from the new plants, complementary\ninvestments in transmission and distribution facilities are required.  Component A of the Project\nincludes the construction of dedicated transmission facilities for the two IPPs, while components\nB and C are dedicated to overall system upgrading. The system-strengthening investments also\nwill  indirectly  benefit  evacuation  from  the  IPPs  in  addition  to  minimizing  losses  and  utilizing\nsurplus  capacity  available  at  other,  state  and  central,  power  stations.  Therefore,  the\ntransmission components were evaluated together with the proposed IPP plants they will serve,\nand also together with the distribution components of the project investments.\n\n108.\nThe  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at\n25.36 percent.  The  EIRR  was  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years,  including  a  four-year\nconstruction period, corresponding to the estimated useful life of the Project. No residual value\nwas considered. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis indicated that the EIRR is adequate except\nfor changes in the overall benefit stream. A 4 percent reduction of the overall benefit stream will\nresult in an EIRR of 12 percent. However, expected that as a result of the reforms, the benefit\nstream will improve and not deteriorate. Details of the sensitivity analysis are in Appendix 18.\n\n109.\nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  at  border  price  level  using  FY2000  prices.  To\nconvert  financial  capital  cost  into  economic  cost,  taxes  and  duties  were  deducted.  No  price\ncontingencies  are  included  in  the  base  capital  cost  but,  the  economic  capital  costs  include  10\npercent  physical  contingencies.  The  costs  were  separated  into  foreign  exchange,  indirect\nforeign  exchange  and  local  currency  costs.  Local  costs  were  further  separated  and  specific\nconversion factors used for unskilled labor. The remaining local costs were converted to border\nprice  level  by  applying  a  standard  conversion  factor.  Annual  operation  and  maintenance  cost\n\n\f30\n\nwere  also  calculated  in  economic  prices  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  capital  investment  cost.\nThe cost of energy at generation level is valued at the IPP takeoff prices for project component\nA,  separately  for  each  IPP,  and  at  GEB\u2019s  power  purchase  pool  price  for  the  additional  units\nresulting  from  components  B  and  C.  Transmission  and  distribution  losses  of  20 percent  were\ndeducted from the IPP send-out volume, but the full send-out volume was priced in the cost of\nenergy.\n\n110.\nThe  economic  benefits  of  electricity  consumption  were  calculated  for  each  major\nconsumer  category.  Nonincremental  electricity  consumption  benefits  were  based  on  the\nalternative  economic  costs  of  other  energy  sources  such  as  diesel  generators  and  kerosene\nlamps  that  will  be  replaced  by  using  electricity.  Incremental,  or  induced,  consumption  was\nvalued at the estimated average willingness to pay for electricity based on a weighted average\nof  the  alternative  costs  of  providing  similar  energy-related  services  and  the  current  electricity\ntariff for each consumer category. The evaluation is described in more detail in Appendix 18.\n\n111.\nFor project component D no quantitative economic evaluation was undertaken due to the\nchallenge  of  determining  the  depletion  premium  for  groundwater.  In  Mahesana  district,  which\nwas selected for implementing of a pilot scheme for converting of irrigation systems, the water\ntable has dropped by about 160 m over the last 25 years.  A GEB-supported study17 in the four\nsubdistricts in Mahesana to be covered by the pilot scheme found a negative net draft recharge\nranging  from  minus  20  to  minus  33  million  cubic  meters  (m3)  year.  If  groundwater  depletion\ncontinues  at  this  rate,  in  a  few  years  time  irrigated  agricultural  activity  in  the  district  will  be\nseverely  limited  or  might  even  have  to  be  replaced  entirely  by  rainfed  agriculture.  Some  deep\ntubewells  have  yielded  high  contents  of  fluorides  and  other  salts,  and  there  is  danger  of\npermanent damage to soil quality.\n\n112.\nThe use of tubewell (lift) irrigation by farmers without detailed knowledge of the irrigation\nmethodology, and in an environment of almost no financial costs for water and electricity, has\nresulted in highly inefficient resource use. The study found very low water use efficiency and low\nproductivity per irrigated hectare.  Yields per hectare could double for most typical crops with a\nshift from lift to drip irrigation, in addition to conserving water and electricity.\n\n113. A  sample  calculation  for  five  different  crops  showed  that  the  average  discharge  of  a\ntubewell is 108 m3 water for per hour or in an annual discharge of 194,400 m3 of water for 20\nhectares. With drip irrigation only 40,800 m3 water will be required for the same area. The net\nwater saving of about 70percent,  would allow a sustainable recharging of the tubewells leading\nto sustained agricultural activities. Data on depletion rates, recharging rates, and water use will\nbe collected from the pilot scheme and the Project could be expanded after analysis of the data.\n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Dimensions\n\n114.\nThe  Sector  Development  Program  is  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  increasing\nelectricity supply in Gujarat, including the rural areas. It will provide a reliable power supply thereby\nimproving  industrialization  and  providing  employment  opportunities.  A  reliable  supply  of  electricity\nwill  also  enhance  education,  health,  and  other  social  facilities.  The  Sector  Development  Program\ndirectly  addresses  poverty  reduction  because  many  of  the  beneficiaries  are  unserved  domestic\nconsumers,  both  rural  and  urban  who,  until  now,  have  not  secured  connections  from  GEB  due  to\nlack of funds.  The Sector Development Program yields very attractive economic returns since it also\n\n                  \n\n17  Final  Report  of  \u2018Installing  Drip  Irrigation  System  in  the  area  of  Mahesana  District\u2019  prepared  by  Water  Resources\n\nEngineering and Management Institute, M.S. University of Baroda, commissioned by GEB, January 1999.\n\n\f31\n\nhelps industrial and commercial consumers; with increasing employment opportunities as a result of\nfaster economic growth, it further helps the poor.\n\n115. Although the Sector Development Program is essentially gender neutral, benefits to women\nas  a  result  of  electricity  supply  are  education,  security,  and  more  comfortable  living.  Increasing\nindustrialization  will  also  enable  women  to  obtain  jobs  and  enhance  their  security  and  status  in\nsociety.\n\nThe  Sector  Development  Program  improves  the  delivery  of  social  services  such  as\n116.\neducation, health, and water supply and sanitation, especially to the poor, by making available for\nsuch activities funds that today are being used to subsidize the electricity sector.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nThe  Sector  Development  Program  has  several  perceived  risks.  The  risks  and  their\n\n117.\ncorresponding mitigating measures are summarized here.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\ninvested  commensurate  with \n\nEstablishment  of  regulatory  authority.    The  success  of  the  entire  reform  effort  is\nbased  on  the  premise  that  actions  in  the  power  sector  will  be  commercially\noriented,  including  rationalization  of  the  tariff  structure  which  would  encourage\nimprovements in operating efficiencies and enable utilities to earn a fair return on\ncapital \nthat\npoliticization  of  the  tariff-setting  process  has  been  a  major  factor  for  the\ndeterioration  of \nthe  Sector\nDevelopment  Program  envisages  the  establishment  of  a  statutory  regulatory\nauthority  whose  responsibilities  will  include  tariff  setting  and  licensing.  The  Bill\ncreating  the  regulatory  authority  also  incorporates  provisions  setting  stringent\neligibility requirements for its members so as to ensure appropriate working of the\nauthority. As advance preparation action, the draft Bill has already been approved\nby the State Government and has been referred to the Government for clearance\nprior to its introduction in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly for its consideration.\n\ntheir  performance.  Recognizing \n\nthe  electricity  supply \n\nindustry  all  over \n\nIndia, \n\nEnforcement  of  Decisions.  Decisions  of  the  regulatory  authority  have  to  be\nenforced  by  the  sector  entities,  often  with  the  support  of  the  State  Government.\nTherefore,  there  has  to  be  confidence  that  decisions  of  the  regulatory  authority,\nespecially  those  that  are  politically  unattractive,  will  be  supported  by  the  State\nGovernment. To demonstrate its will to make difficult political decisions and as a\nmeasure to substantially ease the burden on GEB, GERC has raised the tariff for\nagriculture  consumers  fourfold  from  Re0.15  per  kWh  to  Re  0.80  per  kWh.  This\nlevel is higher than that recommended by the Council under its Common Minimum\nNational  Action  Plan  for  the  power  sector  and  is  higher  than  that  in  states  that\nhave significant agriculture activities based on electricity-dependent irrigation.\n\nAvailability of counterpart funds.  The Ninth Five-Year Plan for the Gujarat power\nsector  represents  the  largest  comparable  investment  in  the  sector  by  the  state\nand  one  of  the  largest  by  any  state  in  India.  Consequently,  there  is  a  risk  of\nshortfall  of  local  counterpart  funds.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  State  Government\nhas budgeted sufficient funds for power sector investments under the Ninth Plan\nand  has  assured  budgeting  and  transfers  of  sufficient  counterpart  funds  each\nyear for the Project.\n\n\f32\n\n(iv)\n\nOperational effectiveness. The operational effectiveness of GEB and other power\nsector  entities  that  will  be  created  during  the  reform  period  will  be  critical  in\ndetermining  success  or  failure.  To  improve  effectiveness,  processes  are  being\nbuilt into the system both to demand completion of critical activities by the sector\nentities and to strengthen their capacity to deliver them on time.\n\n(a) \n\n(b)\n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nThe GERC. The constitution of GERC, initially under the central Electricity\nRegulatory  Commission  Act  and  its  subsequent  confirmation  under  the\nproposed  Act,  sets  up  a  platform  for  consumers  to  scrutinize  the\nperformance of GEB and other sector entities, adding to the pressure on\nthem  to  perform.  In  consultation  with  all  stakeholders,  GERC  has  also\nidentified  key  activities  such  as  metering  of  consumers,  and  has\nmandated a time-bound monitoring  program for its completion. This will\nspur GEB, AECO, and SECO to complete these activities on time.\n\nManagerial focus. The establishment of GSECL and GETCL and transfer\nof  a  part  of  GEB's  responsibilities  to  them  reduces  the  span  of\nresponsibility of GEB's management, allowing it to focus on distribution as\nits main key result area. GSECL and GETCL will also have sharper focus\nin their activities, leading to overall improvements in the sector.\n\nIndependent profit centers. Delegation of powers reinforced by improved\nmanagerial  systems  and  processes,  and  capital  investments  to  reduce\nlosses  are  being  introduced  in  Kheda  (Anand),  Rajkot,  and  Mahesana\ncircles. Support from external consultants under a bilateral cofinancier is\nalso  being  sought  to  help  the  managements  of  these  circles.  These\nimprovements at grassroots levels will greatly enhance the effectiveness\nof sector operations.\n\nAdvance  procurement  action.  Bids  will  be  invited  for  about  $100 million\nworth  of  procurement  under  advance  procurement  action,  by  December\n2000.  They  include  all  critical  equipment  for  system  strengthening  and\nloss  reduction  that  will  be  required  over  the  next  two  years.  Thus,\nimplementation  of  key  activities  will  not  be  constrained  by  supply  of\nequipment.\n\nInduction  of  Experts.  Action  has  been  initiated  by  the  State  Government\nand  GEB  to  induct  experts  into  the  boards  of  directors  of  GEB,  GSECL\nand GETCL. Induction of experts into the management is being initiated.\nThe  performance  of  these  entities  is  expected  to  improve  as  a  result  of\nthese measures.\n\nA. \n\nPrior Actions by the State Government  and GEB\n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n\nIn order to demonstrate its commitment to the structural changes proposed as part of the\n\n118.\nProgram, the following key actions have been completed by the State Government and GEB.\n\n(i)\n\nCompletion  of  environmental  investigations  and  preparation  of  a  summary  initial\nenvironmental examination report acceptable to ADB.\n\n\f33\n\n(ii) \n\nGERC announced its first tariff award on 10 October 2000. The average rates of\nrealization  (exclusive  of  electricity  duty)  for  FY2001  have  been  raised  to  the\nfollowing levels:\n\nCategory\n\nTariff\n(Rs/kWh)\n\nIncrease\n(%)\n\nResidential\nCommercial\nIndustry (LT)\nIndustry (HT)\nPublic Lighting\nRailways\nPublic Water Works\nAgriculture\n\n2.19\n4.05\n3.07\n4.17\n2.74\n4.70\n1.29\n0.80\n\n9.8\n13.4\n14.2\n4.8\n10.4\n3.8\n9.3\n433.0\n\nSource: Staff  estimates based on GERC's order dated 10 October 2000.\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nThe State Government has agreed to initiate rationalization of duties and taxes on\nsale of electricity from FY2002. It has also initiated changes in the charges incident\nupon  the  supplies  of  electricity  by  GEB  and  captive  generators  to  industrial\nconsumers so as to put them on an equal footing.\n\nGERC,  in  its  award  of  10  October  2000,  has  directed  that  all  consumers  be\nmetered  within  3  years  of  its  award.  GEB  has  circulated  a  proposal  of  installing\nmeters on all consumer connections within this defined time frame to its consumer\ngroups \nthe\ntransformer  feeders  of  agriculture  connections  and  about  50,000  meters  have\nalready been installed.\n\nfor  consultations.  GEB  has  commenced \n\ninstalling  meters  on \n\n(iv) \n\nThe State Government\u2019s Cabinet, on 23 October 2000, approved the draft Bill and\nhas forwarded it to the Government for its approval.\n\n119.\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  following  specific  assurances  have  been\ngiven  by  the  Government  and  the  State  Government  that  have  been  incorporated  in  the  legal\ndocuments.\n\nB. \n\nCovenants\n\n1. \n\nGeneral\n\n120.\nThe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreements,  as\ndescribed in the Development Policy Letter, will continue in effect at least for the duration of the\nSector Development Program.\n\n121.\nThe State Government will ensure that sufficient budgetary allocations are made to the\nGEB  and  the  Implementing  Agencies  in  a  timely  manner  for  the  efficient  and  timely\nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  Government  will  make  available,  counterpart  funds  for  the\nimplementation of the Program.\n\nThe  State  Government  and  GEB  agree \n\n122.\nrecommendations of the TAs not later than 31 December 2002, in a manner satisfactory to ADB.\n\ntake  all  steps \n\nimplement \n\nto \n\nto \n\nthe\n\n\f34\n\n123. GEB will ensure that proper metering of all consumers is carried out in a phased manner\nin the state within not more than four years from the date of Loan approval.\n\n2. \n\nAdministrative\n\nTo enable the proper functioning of GEB\u2019s successor entities, the Government and State\n124.\nGovernment will expedite, and assist in expediting, issue of due permits and licenses as may be\nrequired by law;\n\n125. Within a period of 12 months from Loan effectiveness, the State Government will ensure\nthat a majority of the officers in the senior management positions of GSECL and GETCL will be\nrecruited  through  open  competitive  selection  processes  by  the  boards  of  directors  of  these\ncompanies. Further, the State Government shall ensure that the tenure of these officers shall be\nfor  at  least  three  years.  The  State  Government  will  also  progressively  recruit  experts  in\nmanagement positions in GEB.\n\n3. \n\nFinancial\n\n126.\nThe State Government will make timely and adequate budgetary appropriations to meet\nits  subsidy  payment  liabilities  so  as  to  ensure  that  all  subsidy  dues  are  paid  to  GEB  (or  its\nsuccessor entities) and other electricity utilities within not more than six months of the raising of\nthe  claim  by  such  entities.  Further,  the  State  Government  shall  limit  agriculture  subsidies  to\nRs11 billion a year.\n\nIn  order  to  enable  GEB  to  meet  its  operating  deficits,  GOG  will  support,  through\n127.\nproviding its guarantee, domestic market borrowings that GEB may raise for an amount of up to\nRs19,200 million during FY2001 and FY2002.\n\n4. \n\nEnvironment and Social Measures\n\n128.\nThe  State  Government  and  GEB  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in\ncompliance with all applicable rules and regulations and comply with all applicable environment\nassessment procedures under the environmental guidelines of ADB and the Government.\n\n5. \n\nProgram Implementation and Benefit Monitoring\n\nThe  State  Government  and  GEB  will  undertake  together  with  ADB,  periodic  reviews\n129.\nduring  implementation  of  the  Program  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,\nprogress and achievement of scheduled targets and agenda for policy reform, and the Project.\n\n6. \n\nRestructuring of the Power Sector\n\n130.\nThe  development  of  a  Reorganization  Plan  for  GEB  will  be  undertaken  in  a  fair,\ntransparent manner, and the formulation of the privatization and other schemes thereunder, to the\nextent commercially practicable, in a competitive manner.\n\n131. Any  voluntary  retirement  schemes  as  may  be  recommended  under  the  Reorganization\nPlan  will  be  implemented  with  full  participation  and  consultation  of  the  affected  persons,  in\naccordance with applicable laws and regulations.

The associated IPP power projects in the western region of\nGujarat are indicated in Table A5.1.\n\nTable A5.1: Associated Power Projects\n\nProject Name \n\nInstalled Capacity District Name\n\nStatus\n       as of October 2000\n\nReliance\nAkrimota\n\n2x250 MW\n2x125 MW\n\nJamnagar\nKutch\n\nPPA is signed.\nPPA is under preparation.\n\nMW = megawatts, PPA = power purchase agreement\n\n2.\nThe  total  length  of  the  220  kV  transmission  lines  will  be  about  866  circuit-kilometer\n(cct-km).  The  total  additional  number  of  220  kV  substation  bays  will  be  eight  bays.  These\ntransmission  systems  will  connect  new  IPP  power  plants  to  the  existing  220  kV  bulk\ntransmission  systems  of  Gujarat  Electricity  Board  (GEB).  The  output  electric  power  will  be\ndelivered to all GEB distribution circles. The IPP power projects will be fostered and secured\nby  the  installation  of  these  transmission  systems.  This  component  will  be  physically\ncompleted in June 2004.\n\n3.\nThe  project  components  also  have  transmission  systems  to  improve  power  system\nstability, attaining loss reduction and to meet load growth. Materials and equipment will be by\nbulk  purchase  in  conjunction  with  those  in  Part  B.  The  total  augmentation  is  indicated  in\nTable A5.2.\n\nTable A5.2: Total Additional Transmission Systems\n\n                   Description\n\n220/66 kV Substations\n220 kV Transmission Lines\n66/11 kV Substations\n66 kV Sub-transmission Lines\n\n       Quantity\n\n2,700 MVA\n   240 cct-km\n2,815 MVA\n   629 cct-km\n\ncct-km = circuit kilometer, kV = kilovolt, MVA = mega volt-ampere\n\nB.\n\nPart B: Transmission Systems Associated with Profit Centers\n\n4.\nThree districts (distribution circles) are selected as independent profit centers in GEB,\nwhich  will  be  given  management  autonomy  in  accounting,  personnel,  and  procurement  of\nmaterials.  The  annual  load  growth  of  the  three  districts  is  expected  to  be  about  8  percent\nduring  the  next  four  years.  Transmission  systems  between  the  bulk  system  and  the\ndistribution systems of the three districts should be augmented to meet this load growth.  The\ntotal augmentation is in Table A5.3.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nTable A5.3 Augmentation of Transmission Systems\n\n                     Description\n\n400/220 kV Substations\n400 kV Transmission Line\n220/66 kV Substations\n66/11 kV Substations\n66 kV Subtransmission Lines\n\n       Quantity\n630 MVA\n80 cct-km\n200 MVA\n595 MVA\n208 cct-km\n\ncct-km = circuit kilometer, kV = kilovolt, MVA = mega volt-ampere\n\nC.\n\nPart C: Modernization and Upgrading of Distribution System\n\n5.\nThis project component will support the independent profit centers to be established\nin  Kheda  (Anand)  and  Rajkot  distribution  circles  as  well  as  Mahesana  distribution  circle\nwhere a pilot system of drip irrigation system will be installed. Power systems from 220 kV\ntransmission  systems  to  0.4  kV  distribution  lines  including  meters  will  be  modernized  and\nupgraded under the comprehensive investment of GEB. Mobility, logistics, engineering, and\nadministration  will  also  be  modernized  by  providing  computer  systems,  office  equipment,\ncommunications  equipment  and  system,  and  tools  and  tackles.  Operation  of  the  two  profit\ncenters will be strengthened by this modernization and upgrading of the power system along\nwith  the  establishment  of  autonomous  and  commercial  management  in  the  profit  centers\nunder the Asian Development Bank\u2019s TA and training offered by other bilateral aid agencies.\n\nThis  project  component  also  comprises  of  (i)  replacement  of  burnt  and  failed\n6.\ndistribution  transformers  for  five  distribution  circles  (Palanpur,  Jamnagar,  Porbandar,  Bhuj,\nSurendranagar),  and  (ii)  replacement  of  conventional  energy  meters  by  high-quality  static\nmeters on 500,000 installations for 12 distribution circles. These replacements are expected\nto attain (i) the increase in utilization factor from 0.90 to 0.95, and (ii) the accurate billing and\nincrease  in  revenue.  In  addition,  the  Vapi  industrial  area  in  Valsad  distribution  circle  is\nselected as the pilot project for remote reading of 100 high tension (HT) consumers. The total\ntentative investment for this project component is indicated in Table A5.4.\n\nTable A5.4: Estimated Total Investment for Component C\n\n                     Description\n\n11 kV Distribution Lines\n11/0.4 kV Distribution Transformers\n0.4 kV Distribution Lines\nConventional Meters\nHigh-Tension High-Precision Meters\nLow-Tension High-Precision Meters\n11 kV Feeder Shunt Capacitor\n\n       Quantity \n\n  4,380 cct-km\n11,300 cct-km\n  2,800 cct-km\n\n  630,000\n400\n2,560\n\n42.5 MVA\n\ncct-km = circuit kilometer, kV = kilovolt, MVA = mega volt-ampere\n\nD.\n\nPart D: Efficiency Upgrading of GEB Customers\n\n7.\nUnder the current tariff scheme, \u201cper installed horsepower\u201d,  there is no incentive for\nfarmers to conserve electricity. In northern districts including Mahesana, farmers tend to use\nirrigation pumps to get as much groundwater as possible.  This is because farmers can gain\nshort-term benefits from higher cropping yields by growing water-intensive cash crops.  As a\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\nresult, the groundwater level has dropped from about 10 meters below ground in the 1970s\nto an average of 150 meters today. This water level drop is still continuing and will result in\nsaline  water.  This  lower  water  level  also  leads  to  more  electricity  consumption.  In  Gujarat,\nthis  chain  reaction  is  already  recognized  and  several  institutes  in  the  state  made\ncomprehensive  studies.  As  a  result,  modern  irrigation  methods  for  dry  weather  were\nproposed  and  small-scale  pilot  plants  were  implemented.  However,  these  pilot  schemes\nwere  not  large  enough  to  show  their  positive  impact  on  both  water  level  and  electricity\nconsumption.  Therefore,  a  pilot  study  covering  several  villages  is  proposed  to  demonstrate\nthe potential impact of the modern irrigation method and cropping arrangements. Based on\nan assessment of the soil conditions and cropping pattern in Mahesana district and a review\nof  the  power  consumption  due  to  the  current  irrigation  methods,  alternative  economic\nirrigation methods such as drip irrigation will be proposed and a pilot project for about 18,000\nacres (360 wells, 3,600 farmers) will be conducted.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\nPart A : Transmission Systems Associated with IPP Power Projects\nand for System Improvement\n\nForeign\nExchange\n($ million)\n\nLocal Cost\n\nRs million\n\n$ million\nequivalent\n\n$1.00=Rs46.50\nTotal Cost\n($ million)\n\n               \n\n2.83\n\n             \n\n59.35\n\n               \n\n1.28\n\n               \n\n4.11\n\n               \n\n5.21\n\n           \n\n102.51\n\n               \n\n2.20\n\n               \n\n7.41\n\nProject Component\n\nA-1 Reliance Power Project (2x250MW)\n1. 220kV D/C Motikhavadi-Motipanoli\n   (68km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Motipanoli) \n2. 220kV D/C Motikhavadi-Rajkot\n   (130km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Rajkot)\n\nA-2 Akrimota Power Project (2x125MW)\n1. 220kV D/C Akrimota-Nakhatrana\n   (95km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Nakhatrana)\n2. 220kV D/C Nakhatrana-Chitrod\n   (140km, Zebra, 2 Bays at Both Ends)\n\nSubtotal\n\n               \n\n8.04\n\n           \n\n161.86\n\n               \n\n3.48\n\n             \n\n11.52\n\n               \n\n3.88\n\n             \n\n77.78\n\n               \n\n1.67\n\n               \n\n5.55\n\n               \n\n5.83\n\n           \n\n120.94\n\n               \n\n2.60\n\n               \n\n8.43\n\nSubtotal\n\n               \n\n9.71\n\n           \n\n198.72\n\n               \n\n4.27\n\n             \n\n13.98\n\n0.38\n\n2.69\n\n               \n\n               \n\n               \n\nA-Addl.

The project passes through mostly desert wasteland and grazing land.\nAs  such,  the  Department  of  Forest  has  issued  a  No  Objection  Certificate.  However,\ntransmission  line  projects  are  classified  in  category  B  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank's\n(ADB\u2019s)  classification  of  environmental  impacts.  Gujarat  Electricity  Board  (GEB)  has  prepared\nan initial environmental examination (IEE) using the overlay technique. Not all the sites for new\nsubstations have been identified, and for purposes of IEE analysis a typical site is used. GEB\nwill  submit  a  report  on  the  substation  sites  once  those  are  identified  and  submit  to  ADB  a\nchecklist  of  the  expected  environmental  impacts  and  mitigating  measures  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Industrial and Power Development Projects.\nHowever,  given  the  nature  of  the  area  and  that  many  of  these  substations  are  within  existing\nfacilities of GEB, it is expected that the environmental impact will be minor.\n\nProject Description\n\nB.\n\n2.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\nA description of the Project is given in para. 47 of the main RRP report and Appendix 5.\n\n3.\nGujarat  is  located  in  the  western  part  of  India.  Deserts  characterize  the  western  and\nnorthwest  sections  of  the  state.  Mudflats  and  mangrove  swamps  are  the  dominant  features\nalong  the  coastline  of  the  Arabian  Sea.  There  is  no  major  river  system  west  of  Ahmadabad\nbecause of the  extremely  low rainfall. The southeast and eastern sections are affected by the\nsouthwest  monsoon  from  July  to  October.  A  number  of  major  river  systems  in  northern  and\ncentral  India  pass  through  the  state  before  discharging  to  the  Arabian  Sea.  The  major  river\nsystems are located in the southeastern part of the state. The major river systems are Narmada,\nTapi, Mahi, and Sabarmati. All empty into the Gulf of Khambhat. Except for the mountains in the\neastern and southeastern boundaries, the southeast section of Gujarat is relatively flat plain.\n\nMost of the population live in the central and eastern sections of the state. In the eastern\n4.\nsection, which is affected by the monsoon or where irrigation water is available, a wide variety of\ncash  crops  are  grown.  Wheat,  rice,  sugarcane,  and  sorghum  are  cultivated.  In  recent  years,\nhigher value crops such as banana, vegetables and other fruit are cultivated for export and the\ndomestic  market.  In  areas  with  less  rainfall,  peanuts  and  pulses  are  cultivated.  The  semiarid\nsections  are  normally  used  for  grazing  and  are  sparsely  populated.  The  western  and\nnorthwestern sections are mostly the salt desert of the Rann of Kachchh.\n\n1.\n\nAkrimota-Nakhatrana-Chitrod Area\n\n5.\nThe  southwest  coastline  of  Gujarat  is  lined  with  mangrove  swamps  stretching  to  the\nPakistan  border.  The  swamp  width  varies  from  few  a  meters  at  Kandla  port  to  a  few  hundred\nmeters  close  to  the  Pakistani  border.  Behind  the  mangrove  swamps,  the  area  is  dotted  with\nmudflats  that  extend  up  to  20  kilometers  (km)  inland  during  the  summer  months.  The  area  is\narid and during the summer months is bare except for a few acacia trees. During the monsoon\nseason, the area  is covered  with grass  and used  primarily for grazing.  Groundnuts and  other\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\ncrops tolerant of drought are cultivated during the monsoon months. Due to the low agricultural\nproductivity of the area, the population density is very low.\n\nIn  recent  years  with  the  development  of  port  facilities  along  the  coastline,  a  number  of\n6.\nheavy  industries  have  established  in  the  area  especially  around  Kandla  port.  The  heavy\nindustries  have  stimulated  the  growth  of  medium-scale  industries  serving  primarily  the  export\nmarket and the needs of the oil industry. Due to its proximity to the Gulf states, the port along\nthe coastline is the main entry point for oil and other hydrocarbons. The area is crossed by gas\nand  oil  pipelines  serving  the  heavily  populated  northern  states  including  the  capital,  Delhi.  A\nnumber of power plants have been built in the area talking advantage of the vast tract of open\nspace, proximity to fuel supply, and large industrial users.\n\n2.\n\nMotikhavadi-Motipanoli/Motikhavadi-Rajkot/Rajkot-Morbi Area\n\n7.\nThe area is part of the semiarid western section of the peninsula surrounded by the Gulf\nof Kachchh, the Arabian Sea, and the Gulf of Khambhat. Jamnagar on the coast of the Gulf of\nKachchh is the major town and the traditional port before the development of Kandla. Unlike the\nfishing, port, and industrial areas along the coastline, the interior is thinly populated. The main\noccupation  of  the  people  is  herding  goats  and  sheep.  Rajkot  is  the  major  trading  town  in  the\ninterior  being  at  the  crossroads  of  the  highway  from  Porbandar  to  Delhi  and  the  highway\nconnecting to Kandla. With to the development of new industries in Kandla, Jamnagar, and the\ncoastal  areas,  and  availability  of  vast  tracts  of  wastelands,  a  number  of  independent  power\nproducers are locating in the area. There is no major river system in the area because of low\nrainfall.  The  main  tree  species  -  acacia  and  eucalyptus  -  are  sparsely  distributed  along  dry\nriverbeds and depressed areas that hold some water during the short rainy season.\n\n3.\n\nBardoli-Chikhali Area\n\n8.\nThe 40-km line is located in the southeastern section of Gujarat running parallel to the\neastern  coast  of  the  Gulf  of  Khambhat.  The  soil  in  the  area  is  primarily  fertile  alluvial  deposit\nfrom  the  four  major  rivers  passing  through  Gujarat.  The  area  has  flat  rolling  hills  planted  with\nsugarcane, wheat, and rice. During the dry season peanut is planted. The area is located along\nthe  major  transport  road  connecting  Delhi  and  Mumbai.  A  number  of  heavy  industries  are\nscattered in the area and, in recent years the newer industries have settled in industrial estates.\nThe  industries  produce  mostly  chemicals  such  as  dyes,  agrochemicals,  and  various  types  of\nplastic resins. There are also a number of manufacturers of textiles and consumer products.\n\n4.\n\nSubstations\n\n9.\nThe substations are located in various towns along the transmission line routes. The 220\nkV transmission lines will not pass through built-up areas, since 66 kV lines connect substations\nto the service areas. Fifty-five substations will be expanded. The expansion will be carried out\nwithin  existing  substation  facilities  and  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition.  Sixty-five  new\nsubstations will be built each requiring 1-5 hectares (ha). The exception is the 440 kV substation\nin Rajkot, which will require 33.4 ha. Fifteen new substation sites have been identified mostly on\nwasteland  owned  by  the  State  Government.  Two  substation  sites  in  Chitrod  will  be  acquired\nfrom private land owners, one in Jakhwada and another one in Sundarphur. The two substation\nsites  will  have  an  area  of  5  ha  each.  The  private  lands  are  primarily  grazing  land.  No\nresettlement is involved.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n10.\nThe  transmission  system  route  was  selected  to  avoid  the  mangrove  swamps  and  will\npass through the mudflats. The transmission towers and conductors will be a prominent feature\nin  the  area.  This  is  a  residual  impact  of  the  project.  However,  there  is  no  important  landmark\nwhose  aesthetics  could  be  affected  by  the  project.  For  safety  purposes,  the  foundation  of  the\ntransmission towers are built away from dry river beds that normally overflow during flash floods\nthat  infrequently  occur  in  the  semiarid  areas.  The  transmission  towers  will  not  have  any\nsignificant impact on the river flows.\n\n11.\nRehabilitation of old substations along the distribution network may involve the collection\nand disposal of PCB materials in old transformers and other substation equipment. The extent\nof  PCB  to  be  collected  and  disposed  of  has  not  been  determined.  The  GEB  consultant  will\ndetermine the extent of PCB  used in those materials. If PCB is present, it will be collected in\nairtight  containers  and  stored  in  a  secured  area  within  one  of  the  GEB  power  plants  until  a\nsuitable incinerator is available in India. Temporary storage of PCB in airtight containers is an\naccepted  practice  even  in  developed  countries  that  do  not  have  high  temperature  incineration\nfacilities.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n12.\nThe  upgrading  will  most  likely  require  the  appointment  of  a  senior  official  to  head  the\nenvironment  and  safety  unit  at  the  main  office.  The  head  of  the  unit  will  report  directly  to  the\nmanaging  director  in  line  with  current  practices  adapted  worldwide.  Although  the  Project  does\nnot  require  any  environmental  impact  assessment  under  the  existing  regulations  of  the\nGovernment  of  India,  during  construction  the  project  management  office  will  continuously\nmonitor  the  rehabilitation  of  the  substation  to  ensure  conformity  with  acceptable  standards,\nespecially if PCBs are identified.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Conclusion\n\nThe  Project  components  will  pass  through  desert  and  semiarid  areas  in  the  north  and\n13.\nnorthwest sections of Gujarat State. They will not dislocate any agricultural activity nor will they\npass  through  any  built-up  areas.  One  section  of  the  transmission  line  passes  through\nagricultural land. The impact of the Project during construction is limited as the area is cultivated\nwith groundnuts, wheat, and sugarcane. The area under the transmission line could continue to\nbe used for those agricultural activities.\n\nThe  land  acquired  for  the  new  substations  are  mostly  wasteland  outside  towns  and\n\n14.\nindustrial zones developed near the port facilities.\n\nThe  project  environmental  benefits  exceed \n\n15.\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required.\n\nthe  negative \n\nimpacts.

BOARD\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nTo improve operational efficiencies in its electricity sector and make it financially viable and\nself-sustaining, as well  as  to  improve  the delivery of electric power to the citizens of Gujarat, the\nGovernment of Gujarat (the State Government) has embarked on a plan to restructure and reform\nthe sector over the next five years. During the reform process, several major changes will be made\nin the structure of the sector, its governance, the tariff structure, and the customer orientation of its\nemployees.\n\nThe major utility involved in the delivery of electricity to consumers is the Gujarat Electricity\n2.\nBoard  (GEB),  an  autonomous  entity  of  the  State  Government,  established  under  the  Electricity\n(Supply)  Act  of  1948.  GEB  is  a  vertically  integrated  monopoly  serving  consumers  in  all  areas  of\nGujarat,  other  than  Ahmedabad  and  Surat  cities,  which  are  served  by  the  Ahmedabad  Electric\nCompany Limited and the Surat Electric Company Limited. Both are private sector licensees, which\nare also vertically integrated monopolies in their respective distribution territories. Over the years,\nGEB  policies  and  procedures  have  fallen  behind  the  times  and,  coupled  with  an  nonviable  tariff\nand subsidy policy, have driven the organization into near financial ruin. Morale of GEB staff and\nthe quality of service consumers have also fallen. Consequently, a central part of the reforms lies\nin reorganizing GEB.\n\n3.\nGEB  has  commenced  reorganizing  by  establishing  the  Gujarat  State  Electricity  Company\nLimited  (GSECL),  which  will  be  an  independent  power  producer  owning  and  operating  its\nGandhinagar  and  Utran  power  stations,  and  the  Gujarat  Energy  Transmission  Company  Limited\n(GETCL),  which  will  be  responsible  for  owning  and  operating  the  transmission  network  of  GEB.\nBoth GSECL and GETCL have been incorporated under the Companies\u2019 Act, which provides more\nflexibility regarding their shareholding, staff, and decision making. It is expected that in due course,\nmore  generating  units  of  GEB  would  be  similarly  entrusted  to  GSECL  or  to  another  company.\nHowever,  reorganizing  the  distribution  segment  is  more  critical,  since  it  is  the  one  that  incur  the\nmost  losses,  is  poorly  organized,  and  is  the  primary  cause  of  dissatisfaction  among  GEB\u2019s\nconsumers.\n\n4.\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the State Government in the reforms being\nundertaken,  by  providing  of  (i)  policy  advice,  (ii)  technical  assistance  grants  for  studies  and\nconsultations  to  prepare  and  implement  the  reforms,  (iii)  funds  to  cover  part  of  the  costs  of\nadjustment  during  the  reforms;  and  (iv)  investments  in  the  sector.  ADB  has  agreed  to  provide\ntechnical  assistance  to  assist  the  State  Government  and  GEB  over  the  next  18  months  to\nformulate and implement a reorganizing strategy for GEB, focusing on its distribution business.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\n5.\nIn  consultation  with  the  State  Government  and  GEB  and  after  discussing  alternative\nmodels, the consultants will, (i) prepare an overall strategy for reforming of the distribution sector,\n(ii) segregate the assets and liabilities of the identified distribution areas, (iii) establish the imputed\ntariffs in each distribution area based on a range of consumer mix and generation scenarios, and\n(iv)  develop  a  mechanism  for  addressing  subsides  within  and  across  distribution  areas.  The\nsuitability of each model will be judged against the criteria that will include (i) efficiency of delivery,\n(ii)  maximizing  the  benefits  of  competition,  (iii)  least  cost  to  the  consumers,  and  (iv)  maximizing\ncontribution to sustainable public finances by lowering  subsidies and limiting  cross-subsidies. The\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nconsultant will also examine matters relating to (i) rationalization of GEB\u2019s personnel, (ii) unfunded\nliabilities of GEB, and (iii) costs of adjustments.\n\nAfter  the  model  under  the  reorganization  plan  has  been  developed  and  the  necessary\n6.\nstudies completed, the Consultant will, if studies show the feasibility and practicability of privatizing\na distribution area, (i) prepare documents necessary for solicitation of private sector participation in\none distribution entity, and (ii) help in evaluating the offers received. Privatization  will be done in\nan open, competitive, and transparent manner.\n\n1.\n\nInternational Consultants\n\na. \n\nCorporate Reorganizing Policy Expert/ Team Leader\n(4 person-months)\n\n7.\nThe  corporate  reorganizing  policy  expert  will  be  the  team  leader  for  the  team  of\ninternational  and  domestic  consultants.

During  this  reform  process,  several  major  changes\nwill be made in the structure of the sector, its governance, the tariff structure, and the customer\norientation  of  its  employees.  These  changes  may  temporarily  put  pressure  on  some  of  the\nsector\u2019s  stakeholders,  who  may  perceive  some  of  the  changes  as  being  inimical  to  their\ninterests.  The  State  Government  believes  that  the  anxiety  of  the  affected  groups  and  their\ntendency  to  oppose  the  reform  process  will  greatly  diminish  if  all  stakeholder  groups  are\nregularly consulted during the reform process, and are able to contribute to it in terms of ideas,\nin disseminating information and in providing feedback as to its success. There is also a greater\npurpose in initiating this consultative process at this time, since the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory\nCommission  (GERC)  has  been  constituted  and  will,  over  the  next  year,  formulate  the  long-term\nvision for  tariff setting and regulation for the sector.\n\n2.\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  assisting  the  State  Government  in  the  reforms\nbeing  undertaken,  through  provision  of  (i)  policy  advice,  (ii)  technical  assistance  grants  for\nstudies and consultations to prepare and implement the reforms, (iii) funds to cover part of the\ncosts  of  adjustment  during  the  reforms,  and  (iv)  investments  in  the  sector.  To  improve  the\nconsultative and participatory processes for the reform process, ADB acting on a request from\nthe  State  Government,  agreed  to  provide  technical  assistance  to  enable  Nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  representing  the  major  consumer  groups  in  Gujarat,  to  form  a\nconsultative forum called the Electricity Consumers\u2019 Consultative Forum (ECCF) of Gujarat.\n\n3.\n  Three consumer categories represent a majority of the electricity consumers in Gujarat:\n(i) residential consumers who are largely represented by the Consumer Education and Research\nCentre  (CERC);  (ii)  agriculture  consumers  who  are  largely  represented  by  the  Bharatiya  Kisan\nSangh  (Indian  Farmers'  Union-BKS);  and  (iii)  industrial  consumers  that  are  represented  by  the\nConfederation  of  Indian  Industry\u2013Gujarat  Chapter  (CII).  When  the  reform  program  was  first\ndiscussed  in  1996  with  the  State  Government,  the  preparatory  TAs  funded  by  ADB  did  include\nconsultations and workshops with these stakeholders. These organizations also represented the\nconsumer groups in the public hearings organized by GERC over the past one year.\n\nB.\n\n4. \n\nTerms of Reference\n\nThe TA will fund\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\nfour consumer information workshops in different parts of Gujarat over one year;\n\ntravel,  stay  costs,  and  honorarium  fees  of  domestic  experts,  so  that  they  can\nprovide inputs to the working of the ECCF; and\n\npreparation  of  information  materials  to  further  disseminate  information  to  the\nconstituents of the ECCF.\n\n\f82\n\nAppendix 16, page 1\n\nSUPPORT TO GUJARAT ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nTo  improve  operational  efficiencies  in  its  electricity  sector  and  make  it  financially  viable\nand self-sustaining, as well as to improve the delivery of electric power to the citizens of the State\nof  Gujarat  in  India,  the  Government  of  Gujarat  (the  State  Government)  embarked  a  plan  to\nrestructure  and  reform  the  sector  over  the  next  five  years.  During  the  reform  process,  several\nmajor changes will be made in the structure of the sector, its governance, the tariff structure, and\nthe  customer  orientation  of  its  employees.  As  part  of  this  reform,  the  Gujarat  Electricity\nRegulatory  Commission  (GERC)  was  established  in  1998  and  mandated  to  discharge  a  large\nspectrum of functions including determining tariffs and corresponding performance norms, issuing\nlicenses and ensuring a nondiscriminatory and commercial business environment. GERC, which\nwas established under the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998 of the Indian Parliament,\nwill be formalized under the Gujarat Electricity Industry (Reorganization and Regulation) Bill, 2000\n(the  Act),  which  is  expected  to  be  enacted  in  2001.  GERC  currently  consists  of  a  chairman,\n2 members and 24 supporting and auxiliary staff. The small size of its permanent staff reflects the\nintention  of  the  State  Government  to  maximize  the  use  of  outside  consultants  for  specific  tasks\ninstead of keeping all technical expertise required as part of the permanent workforce.\n\n2.\nThe Act requires the framing of regulations related to the general conduct of GERC\u2019s affair\nand  its  discharge  of  functions,  to  enable  GERC  to  function  in  a  transparent  manner.  Further,\nGERC  desires  to  it  frame  and  adopt  long-term  tariff  and  regulatory  policies  that  will  provide  a\nstable tariff and regulatory regime conducive to the proper growth and development of the sector.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the State Government in the reforms, by\n3.\nproviding  of  (i) policy  advice,  (ii)  technical  assistance  grants  for  studies  and  consultations  to\nprepare and implement the reforms, (iii) funds to cover part of the costs of adjustment during the\nreforms,  and  (iv)  investments  in  the  sector.  ADB  has  agreed  to  provide  technical  assistance  to\nsupport GERC over the next 18 months to (i) help draft a tariff and regulatory policy valid for the\nnext five years; (ii) help adapt the draft regulations in force in other states of India and abroad, to\nmake them applicable to Gujarat; (iii) provide expert advice to interpret the regulations and tariff\npolicies; and (iv) train key GERC staff in administering the regulations.\n\nB. \n\nScope of Work\n\n1.\n\nPreparation of Regulations and Codes\n\n4.\nThe consultants will review the regulations in force in other states in India and abroad and\nadapt such regulations for application by GERC. If appropriate regulations do not exist, new ones\nwill be prepared. Each regulation will be drafted and submitted in five hard copies to GERC and\none copy to ADB, and in a MSWord 2000 electronic format to both. After comments are received\nand incorporated, the final versions will be submitted in five hard copies to GERC and one copy\nto  ADB,  with  MSWord  2000  electronic  versions  to  both.  The  regulations  will  cover  the  following\nareas:\n\n(i) \n\nStructure  and  modalities  of  regulatory  control.  These  regulations  include  rules,\ntechnical,  legal  and  price  regulations,  licenses  and  operational  codes  as  listed\nbelow:\n\n\f(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\n(h)\n(i)\n(j)\n(k) \n(l) \n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d) \n(e) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\n83\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\ngrid and distribution code,\nmetering,\ninterconnection,\nsharing of assets and common facilities,\nstandards of performance (including customer service standards),\nsupply regulations,\nsupply regulations,\naccess to facilities,\nclass exemptions from Licensing, etc.,\nplanning standards;\ncompetitive procurement; and\ndemand side management.\n\n(ii) \n\nBusiness conduct regulations. These regulations relate to the procedures of GERC\nwith  reference  to  the  sector  entities  and  processes,  and  covers  specific  matters\nsuch as\n\nlicense application,\npower procurement process,\nprice regulation,\nrevenue and tariff determination and fixation,\ncaptive generating units,\nfees, fines and charges, and\ndispute resolution.\n\nInternal regulations of GERC. These regulations pertain to the internal working of\nthe GERC and cover\n\nappointment of chairman and members,\nappointment of staff and consultants,\nHRD issues and organizational structure,\nconditions of service of staff, and\nfunctions and procedures of GERC.\n\n2. \n\nTraining and Operational Support to GERC\n\n5.\n\nThe consultant will organize a human development exercise for GERC staff as follows:\n\nExternal training for selected officers and staff.  Within the budget indicated in the\nTA, the consultant will prepare and implement a training program for key officers\nand  employees  of  GERC,  including  (a)  in-house  training  and  workshops  in\nunderstanding  and  application  of  the  new  regulations  at  Ahmedabad  (this  will\ninclude staff from other power sector entities); and (b) visits by GERC senior staff\nGERC to attend international seminars and conferences.\n\nAnalytical  and  operational  support  in  interpreting  regulations  and  codes.  For  one\nyear  after  the  new  regulations  are  approved  and  published,  the  consultants  will\nassist  GERC  in  interpreting  and  operationalizing  them.  This  would  include\n(a) providing  of  reference  cases  pertaining  to  application  of  the  regulations;\n(b) suggesting  for  modifications  of  the  regulations  considering  experience  gained\nin their application.  \n\n\f84\n\nAppendix 17, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe  major  assumptions  used  in  the  financial  evaluation  of  the  investment  project  are\n\n1.\ndiscussed in this appendix.\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\n2.\nThe financial evaluation of the Project was carried out on an incremental basis and also\non a subproject basis due to its discrete nature. Income tax is not considered since the Gujarat\nElectricity  Board  (GEB)  is  exempted  from  income  tax  payment.  All  prices  are  in  constant\nOctober 2000 value.

Proposals have been solicited for\nabout 4,400 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity on a build-own-operate basis. A number of\npower purchasing agreements have been signed, among which are those for the Reliance and\nAkrimota independent power producers (IPPs) with a combined capacity of 750 MW. To allow\nevacuation  of  power  from  the  new  plants,  complementary  investments  in  transmission  and\ndistribution  facilities  are  required.  Component  A  of  the  Project  includes  the  construction  of\ndedicated transmission facilities for the two IPPs, while components B and C are dedicated to\noverall system upgrading. The system strengthening investments will indirectly also benefit the\nevacuation from the IPPs in addition to saving losses and utilizing surplus capacity available at\nother state and central power stations. Therefore, the transmission components were evaluated\ntogether  with  the  proposed  IPP  plants  they  will  serve,  and  also  together  with  the  distribution\ncomponents of the project investments.\n\nA. \n\nCapital Cost\n\n2.\nThe  economic  capital  cost  of  project  components  A,  B,  and  C  were  estimated  on  the\nbasis  of  the  financial  costs,  with  appropriate  adjustments  made  to  reflect  the  true  resource\n(economic)  costs  of  the  different  components.  The  estimated  capital  costs  for  the  project\ncomponent  were  broken  down  into  direct  foreign  exchange  items,  indirect  foreign  exchange\nitems,  local  goods  and  services  and  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  for  purposes  of  the  economic\nanalysis. All elements were valued at border prices with all taxes and duties excluded. No price\ncontingencies  are  included  in  the  base  capital  cost.  However,  the  economic  capital  costs\ninclude 10 percent physical contingencies. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 has been applied\nto all non-tradable items and a shadow wage rate of 0.85 was used for unskilled labor.\n\nAnnual  operation  and  maintenance  cost  were  also  calculated  in  economic  prices  as  a\n3.\npercentage of the total capital investment cost. All prices are in constant October 2000 values.\nThe  cost  of  energy  at  generation  level  was  valued  at  the  IPP  take-off  prices  for  project\ncomponent  A,  separately  for  each  IPP,  and  at  GEB\u2019s  power  purchase  pool  price  for  the\nadditional  units  resulting  from  project  components  B  and  C.  Transmission  and  distribution\nlosses of 20 percent were deducted from the IPP send-out volume, but the full send-out volume\nwas priced in the cost of energy.\n\nB. \n\nBenefits\n\n4.\nEconomic  benefits  of  electricity  consumption  were  calculated  for  all  major  consumer\ncategories. For nonincremental consumption they were based on the alternative economic costs\nof other energy sources such as diesel generators and kerosene lamps that will be replaced by\nusing electricity. For incremental electricity consumption, the benefits were estimated by valuing\nadditional or induced energy consumption at the estimated willingness to pay.\n\nA balance between power demand and supply was recently achieved in Gujarat State,\n5.\nand  therefore  nonincremental  consumption  was  assumed  to  be  marginal  for  all  consumer\ngroups.  The shares of electricity supply assumed to replace an alternative energy source were\nthus 10 percent for domestic, commercial and low tension (LT) industry, and seven percent for\n\n\f90\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\nagriculture.  The  latter  value  is  based  on  a  7  percent  ownership  of  diesel  pumps  among\nagricultural  users  identified  in  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  study.1  GEB  tariff  for  high\ntension (HT) consumers is currently equal to or higher than the equivalent unit costs for different\ntypes  of  captive  generation  except  for  captive  units  running  on  naphtha.  Approximately  23\npercent  of  captive  units  are  operated  with  naphtha  and  this  percentage  was  used  as  the\nreplacement share for HT consumers. The economic benefit of fuel substitution is the resulting\neconomic resource cost saving that is, the economic cost of alternative energy that the country\nsaves by using electricity.\n\nInduced  consumption  was  valued  by  estimating  the  consumer\u2019s  willingness  to  pay  for\n6.\nthis  part  of  incremental  electricity  supply  and  adding  the  related  consumer  surplus  benefits  to\nthe tariff-based revenues. Given the sensitivity of demand to price for the various categories of\nconsumers,  only  a  portion  of  the  maximum  consumer\u2019s  surplus  benefits  was  assumed  for  the\nvaluation of induced sales.\n\n7.\nThe  ADB  study  found  that  all  HT  industries  own  at  least  one  captive  generation  unit\neach, varying in size from 160 kilowatt (kW) diesel generators to 50 megawatt (MW) gas plants.\nCaptive power production is on average cheaper than power supplied from the grid especially\nso  for  co-generating  plants.  This  is  mainly  due  to  high  cross-subsidization  and  the  electricity\nduty  that  is  levied  on  the  grid  tariff,  but  which  does  not  have  to  be  paid  in  full  for  captive\nproduction. Changes to the tariff structure and the electricity duty (ED) are addressed under the\nProgram  and  are  expected  to  have  a  gradual  positive  impact  on  HT  share  of  consumption\nstarting in FY2001/02. For the economic evaluation a conservative approach was chosen and\nHT  consumers  were  valued  at  only  23  percent  of  the  HT  consumption  share  for  the  benefit\ncalculation.  No  induced  consumption  was  assumed  for  the  remaining  77  percent  as  their\nwillingness to pay is limited by the cost of self-generation which, for a 160 kw diesel generator is\ncurrently Rs per kWh 4.15 compared with a total financial price of Rs per kWh 5.25. While it is\nexpected  that  grid  supply  for  HT  consumers  will  become  much  more  attractive  in  the  medium\nterm  as  a  result  of  the  policy  changes,  a  cautious  approach  was  considered  appropriate  to  in\nvaluing  benefits  to  HT  consumers.  The  remaining  77  percent  share  of  HT  was  distributed\nproportionally over the LT, commercial, and domestic user categories.\n\n8.\n\nAlternative sources of power used by the LT industry, commercial, domestic, and\n\nagricultural users were determined and their respective costs were estimated. It was found that\nthe dominant source of alternative power in the rural domestic sector is kerosene lamps. In case\nof urban domestic consumers, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) lights (\u201cPetromax\u201d) are used more\nfrequently than kerosene lamps. Further, ownership of generators increases rapidly with the rise\nin household income - all households having an income of more than Rs40,000 a month (in\ncurrent 1997 prices) reported ownership of a small diesel generator. Even among lower middle-\nincome households, with income of Rs5,000-Rs15,000, eight percent own a small kerosene\ngenerator. Roughly around 40 percent of total end consumption in the domestic sector is used\nfor lighting purposes. In the rural areas these numbers are considerably higher due to\nsignificantly lower ownership of electrical appliances. Therefore, economic benefits for the\ndomestic sector were calculated for only 40 percent of total incremental domestic consumption.\nThis 40 percent reflects ownership of a variety of alternative energy sources that have been\nvalued separately. The remaining 60 percent share of domestic consumption is 89\n\n                  \n\n1   TA  No.  2739-IND:  Development  of  a  Framework  for  Electricity  Tariffs  in  Gujarat,  for  $300,000  approved  on\n17 December 1996. Data on the ownership of alternative energy sources used in this Appendix is based on the\nTA study.\n\n\f91\n\nAppendix 18, page 3\n\nconsidered indifferent as the consumers do not own alternative energy sources. This share was\nvalued at the average tariff for the residential category.\n\n9.\nThe  40  percent  share  reflecting  ownership  of  alternative  energy  generation  was\nallocated  over  the  four  alternative  energy  sources.  Given  Gujarat\u2019s  relative  wealth,  it  can  be\nassumed  that  5  percent  of  domestic  consumers  own  kerosene  generators  and  5  percent  a\ndiesel generator set. Another 50 percent are assumed to own a Petromax, while the remaining\n40  percent  rely  on  kerosene  lamps  and  candles  for  alternative  energy.  Induced  consumption\nwas  valued  using  the  willingness-to-pay  method  plus  the  related  consumer  surplus  with  a\ncurvature factor of 0.3.\n\n10.\nCommercial sector use of alternative sources of power also differs between urban and\nrural  areas.  While  in  the  urban  areas  the  commercial  sector  uses  a  mix  of  small  diesel  and\nkerosene  generators  and  Petromax,  in  the  rural  areas  kerosene  lamps  and  candles  are\ndominant. However, the large commercial sector segment shows user patterns more similar to\nsmall and medium-size industries. Typically, hotels, hospitals, office complexes, and universities\nwould  be  considered  large  commercial  sector.  Commercial  sector  consumers  are  defined  as\nhaving  a  contractual    load  below  25  kilovolt-amperes  (kVA).  The  average  economic  cost  of\nalternative energy sources for commercial establishments was estimated at Rs3.96 per kWh for\na 54 kW generator.\n\n11.\nLT industry consumers can also be divided into small and large users depending on the\ncontracted  load.  Small  LT  consumers  are  similar  to  large  commercial  consumers  in  terms  of\nalternative energy  sources. Among  the LT consumer category, 46 percent of industries with a\ncontractual load between 25 and 100 kVA own diesel generators with an average capacity of 70\nkW. The estimated financial cost of production of these units was estimated at Rs.3.87, which\nwas used in the benefit calculation.\n\nAgricultural tariffs in Gujarat are historically very low and have shown little change over\n12.\nthe  last  10  years.  The  low  power  tariffs  have  resulted  in  ownership  of  electric  pumps  by\n92.5 percent of households and an increase in agriculture's share of total GEB consumption to\n43 percent. Only 7.5 percent of households own diesel pump sets. Capital costs of diesel pump\nsets are on average considerably lower than those of an equivalent capacity electric pump set.\nHowever,  considering  the  larger  size  and  higher  utilization  of  electric  pump  sets  and  the\nconsiderably lower fuel costs, the average cost per kWh of output is lower for the electric pump\nset.  The  financial  cost  for  a  unit  produced  by  a  diesel  pump  set  is  estimated  at  Rs4.73\ncompared with Rs0.47 for an electric pump. Even at the increased agricultural tariff of Rs.0.58,\nwhich results in a total unit cost of Rs.0.9, diesel pumps are not competitive with electric pumps.\n\n13. With  the  projected  increase  of  tariff  for  agriculture  and  the  mandated  metering  of  all\nconsumers, it is expected that agricultural consumption will decrease significantly in the future.\nTherefore, no induction benefits were calculated for the 92.5 percent share of households with\nelectric pumps. As for HT consumers, this volume was distributed over the LT, commercial, and\ndomestic consumer categories according to their share in total GEB consumption.\n\nC.\n\nConclusion\n\n14.\nOn the basis of a comparison of economic cost and benefits over a 20-year period, the\nproposed  transmission  and  distribution  component  shows  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return\n(EIRR) of 25  percent.  This value comfortably exceeds  ADB's minimum cut off level for project\n\n\f92\n\nAppendix 18, page 4\n\nacceptability.  Comprehensive  sensitivity  testing  found  that  the  Project  is  robust  except  for\nchanges  in  the  overall  benefit  stream.  A  four  percent  reduction  of  the  overall  benefit  stream\nwould result in an EIRR of 12 percent. Based on that finding, the sensitivity to changes in each\nindividual benefit stream for the five consumer categories was tested. The analysis shows that\nthe EIRR is most sensitive to changes in benefits of the LT and domestic consumer categories,\nbut remains above the cut off rate of 12 percent for all tested situations except for a 20 percent\nreduction  in  domestic  benefits.  Further  testing  was  done  for  the  LT  and  domestic  consumer\ncategories to determine how vulnerable the project is to changes in key parameters underlying\nthese two benefit flows.\n\n15.\nIn the LT category the base case for induction and replacement proportion is 90:10. This\nproportion has been changed to 50:50 and 10:90, the most adverse scenario. However, in both\ncases the EIRR remains well above the cutoff rate. The sensitivity of the EIRR to changes in the\nLT benefit stream appears to be mainly the result of its high share (33 percent) in total benefits,\nwhich magnifies the impact of modest changes in the underlying benefit stream.\n\n16.\nThe  base  case  for  induction  and  replacement  proportions  for  the  domestic  category  is\nthe same as for the LT category and the same sensitivity testing was done. In both cases the\nEIRR  increased  significantly.  This  was  expected  as  the  base  case  reflects  the  most\nconservative  scenario.  However,  as  a  further  test,  the  share  of  domestic  consumers  owning\nalternative  energy  sources  (kerosene  lamps,  etc)  as  opposed  to  indifferent  consumers  not\nowning  alternative  energy  sources  was  varied.  The  base  case  proportion  was  40:60.  If  the\nproportion  is  assumed  to  be  equal,  then  the  EIRR  increases  by  nine  percentage  points.\nHowever, if the share changes to 30:70, the EIRR drops to 13 percent, displaying a sensitivity\nindicator  of  9.15  percent.  Given  that  Gujarat  is  the  third  richest  Indian  State  in  terms  of  state\ndomestic product per capita, a 40 percent ownership of alternative energy sources appears to\nbe a realistic assumption, particularly as four categories of captive energy were considered. As\nin  the  case  of  LT  consumers,  the  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  changes  in  the  domestic  benefit\nstream appears to be driven by its high share  (48 percent) in total benefits. It should be recalled\nthat these high shares are the result of the distribution of 78 percent of HT and of 92.5 percent\nof agriculture consumption over the remaining three consumer categories that were included in\nthe  benefit  calculation.  Public  lighting,  railways,  public  waterworks  and  bulk  supply,  which\naccount for 11.2 percent of total consumption, were excluded from the benefit calculation.\n\n17.\nTo account for the sensitivity to changes in fuel cost, a switching value test was carried\nout. The test showed that for an 8 percent increase in total fuel cost, the EIRR would drop to 12\npercent. However, in the financial projections the average annual GEB pool fuel cost increase\n(for self-generated and IPP power) was assumed to be 4 percent.\n\n\f            ECONOMIC INTERNAL RATE OF
