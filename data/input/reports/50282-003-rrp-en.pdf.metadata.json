It supports the countries in \n(i) pooling  the  procurement  of  the  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  vaccine,  the  pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine (PCV), and the rotavirus vaccine through the United Nations Children's Fund \n(UNICEF); (ii) strengthening primary health care and the capacity to deliver vaccination programs; \nand (iii) increasing community awareness and the population's knowledge of and attitude toward \nvaccines.  The  project  will  reduce  the  burden  and  minimize  outbreaks  related  to  vaccine-\npreventable diseases, integrate immunization programs into broader health systems, and improve \naccess  to  primary  health  services.  As  a  response  to  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic, the governments of Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu have been preparing for the \nimminent arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, and have requested additional financing from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  further  strengthen  immunization  programs  and  prepare  for  the \nvaccine  rollout. 2  The  additional  financing  will  build  on  the  original  project  to  support  the  four \ngovernments in meeting their urgent needs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nOriginal project. ADB approved the original project for $25.1 million on 8 November 2018 \n(footnote  1).  It  comprises  a  loan  of  $2.25  million  (Vanuatu)  from  ADB\u2019s  concessional  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  and  grants  of  $7.50  million  (Samoa),  $3.85 million  (Tonga),  $2.50 million \n(Tuvalu), and $9.00 million (Vanuatu) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The governments are \nproviding  combined  counterpart  funding  of  $4.56  million.  The  loan  and  grant  agreements  for \nVanuatu  were  signed  on  28  February  2019  and  became  effective  on  1  July  2019.  The  grant \nagreement for Samoa was signed on 21 January 2019 and became effective on 1 July 2019; the \ngrant agreement for Tonga was signed on 29 November 2018 and became effective on 14 August \n2019;  and  the  grant  agreement  for  Tuvalu  was  signed  on  12  December  2018  and  became \neffective  on  29  August  2019.  The  closing  date  for  the  loan  and  grants  is  31  May  2024.  The \nministries of finance in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu are the executing agencies, and the \nrespective  ministries  of  health  (MOHs)  are  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  project.  All  four \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMC)  have  signed  agreements  with  UNICEF  to  procure  new \nvaccines  and  strengthen  immunization.  They  share  a  regional  project  management  unit  with \nseparate contracts and local consultants in each country to support the project's implementation.  \n \n4. \nProject performance. The original project is rated for attention as of the fourth quarter of \n2020,3 primarily because of initial delays in contract awards and disbursements, which are being \naddressed. The performance of the project is considered satisfactory in other aspects.  \n\n \n\n1   ADB. Systems Strengthening for Effective Coverage of New Vaccines in the Pacific Project.  \n2   This  lending  proposal  was  not  included  in  ADB.  2019.  Regional  Operations  Business  Plan,  Pacific,  2020\u20132022. \nManila.  The  COVID-19  outbreak  occurred  in  2020.  The  Pacific  Department  confirmed  that  the  2020  resource \nenvelope can accommodate such financial assistance. A revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nNo transaction technical assistance is required. \n\n3  As per ADB. 2018. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5. Manila, the concept paper for the additional \n\nfinancing was approved on 23 September 2020, since the original project was rated for attention.  \n\n\f2 \n\n(i) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. The implementation is rated on track to deliver all \nexpected  outputs  (para.  13).  For  output  1,  the  UNICEF  Vaccine  Independence \nInitiative (VII) agreements have been amended, and the VII credit line increased \nin all four countries to procure three new vaccines, i.e., the HPV vaccine, the PCV, \nand  the  rotavirus  vaccine  (para.  14).  For  output  2,  UNICEF  output  agreements \nhave been signed, and initial activities for health system strengthening have taken \nplace  in  all  four  countries,  including  forecasting  vaccine  procurement,  updating \nnational immunization policies  with  gender  considerations, updating  child  health \nimmunization  cards,  and  supporting  integrated  outreach  programs.  Delays  in \nimplementation are expected, however, because of the ongoing response to the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  and  associated  travel  restrictions  (para.  15).  For  output  3, \ncommunity engagement activities commenced in the first quarter of 2021. UNICEF \nis seeking to integrate these with ongoing risk communication activities (para. 16).  \nContract awards and disbursements. Actual contract awards total $12.0 million \n(47.9%  of  the  project  amount)  and  disbursements  are  $6.9  million  (27.4%).4 \nThe delays in contract awards (76% against 2020 projections) and disbursements \n(65% against 2020 projections) are attributable to the relative inexperience of the \nimplementing agencies with ADB-financed projects. The situation improved when \na  project  management  firm  was  recruited  in  February  2020  to  assist  the \nimplementing  agencies  on  procurement,  multiple  withdrawal  applications,  and \ndisbursements. There are currently no cost overruns. \nFinancial management covenants. The original project is on track on compliance \nwith financial management covenants.  \nSafeguard  policy  requirements.  All  safeguards  covenants  under  the  original \nproject are being complied with.  \nManagement  of  risks.  Project  risks  are  being  managed  successfully  through \n(a) the  recruitment  of  a  project  management  firm  to  support  the  implementing \nagencies in financial reporting and procurement; and (b) the update of the UNICEF \nvaccine  agreements  by  all  four  countries  early  in  project  implementation, \nhighlighting  their  continued  commitment  to  the  partnership  with  UNICEF  and  to \nimproving immunization.  \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n5. \nAdditional  financing.  The  governments  of  Samoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu  have \nincurred considerable costs to prevent the entry of COVID-19 through travel restrictions,  5 while \nmitigating the pandemic\u2019s effects on their economies. Additional financing is proposed to expand \nthe scope of the original project, i.e., to include the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, which will \nenable the gradual reopening of borders and economies, and reestablish the free movement of \npeople both nationally and internationally. Since the regulatory approvals and supply of COVID-\n19  vaccines  to  eligible  countries  under  the  COVID-19  Vaccines  Global  Access  (COVAX)  and \nAdvance Market Commitment (AMC) mechanisms\u2014are still in progress, the exact vaccine type \nand delivery timeline remains to be confirmed. The additional financing will further strengthen the \nhealth  systems\u2019  routine  immunization  programs  and  community  engagement  activities.  With \nCOVID-19 vaccines expected to be available from Q2 2021 through COVAX, Pacific countries \nneed to prepare their health systems to safely introduce any such vaccine. 6 The additional scope \nis a high priority for the governments as they plan to open their borders to travel, and is consistent \nwith the original project in strengthening health systems and increasing immunization coverage.  \n \n\n \n\n4  As of 31 December 2020. \n5  As of 16 March 2021, Samoa had reported four imported cases of COVID-19 and Vanuatu three cases, all of which \nhave recovered. Tonga and Tuvalu remain free of COVID-19. Cumulatively across Pacific DMCs, 2,364 confirmed \ncases and 28 deaths have been reported. \n\n6  COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the vaccine alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and the World \nHealth Organization (WHO). It was established in April 2020 to accelerate global access to COVID-19 vaccines. \n\n \n\n\fThe additional financing will benefit from the established regional project management unit \n6. \nand a stronger partnership with UNICEF on immunization systems and vaccine procurement. The \nintroduction  of  COVID-19  vaccines  through  the  additional  financing  will  rely  on  procurement \narrangements  established  under  the  ongoing  project,  supported  by  measures  to  strengthen \nimmunization  systems  and  community  engagement.  Initial  delays  in  contract  awards  and \ndisbursements  can  also  be  minimized  by  using \nimplementation \narrangements. The additional financing will support the overall project in achieving the outcome \nof increased national immunization coverage. No cost overruns exist at present. No new major or \ncomplex contracts are proposed. The COVID-19 vaccines will be procured through UNICEF, the \nlead procurement agency under COVAX.7 \n \n7. \nImpact  of  the  pandemic.  Growth  with  COVID-19  is  expected  to  be  lower  than  pre-\nCOVID-19  projections  in  all  four  countries,  and  fiscal  balances  are  set  to  worsen  in  FY2021 \n(Table 1).8 COVID-19-related border restrictions have severely hurt local commercial activities, \nespecially  tourism  and  construction,  and  many  businesses  are  facing  financial  difficulties  and \nlaying off workers. The pandemic, coupled with the impacts of cyclones Harold and Tino in 2020, \nhas led to supply chain bottlenecks and disruptions in production, and lowered tax revenues.   \n \n\nthe  original  project\u2019s \n\nTable 1: Growth and Fiscal Impacts  \n\nTonga \n\nTuvalu \n\nSamoa \n\nCountry \n\nIndicator \n\nWith COVID-19 \n\nGrowth (%) \nFiscal balance (% of GDP) \nGrowth (%) \nFiscal balance (% of GDP) \nGrowth (%) \nFiscal balance (% of GDP) \nGrowth (%) \nFiscal balance (% of GDP) \n\nPre-COVID-19 \nFY2020  FY2021  FY2020e  FY2021p \n(9.2) \n(9.8) \n(5.3) \n(4.7) \n2.5 \n0.0 \n2.0 \n(2.0) \n( ) = negative, e = estimates, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, GDP = \ngross domestic product, p = projections. \nNote:  The  fiscal  year  ends  on  30  June  in  Samoa  and  Tonga,  and  on  31  December  in \nTuvalu and Vanuatu. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n2.7 \n(2.0) \n2.7 \n(1.5) \n4.0 \n2.5 \n3.2 \n0.8 \n\n3.5 \n(1.2) \n2.0 \n0.9 \n4.4 \n1.8 \n3.1 \n(1.0) \n\n(3.3) \n6.2 \n(0.5) \n3.1 \n0.5 \n9.1 \n(9.8) \n2.5 \n\nVanuatu \n\n \n8. \nAll four governments have declared and remain in states of emergency in connection with \nthe pandemic as of March 2021, and introduced measures to control the potential spread of the \ndisease,  such  as  (i)  implementing  border  and  travel  restrictions,  local  lockdowns,  and  social \ndistancing  rules  for  mass  gatherings;  and  (ii)  strengthening  health  systems  to  prepare  for  and \nrespond  to  COVID-19  through  a  national  COVID-19  response  plan,  or  equivalent.  The \ngovernments are now looking at the introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine as another key measure \nto limit and control the pandemic. \n \n9. \nGovernment response (needs assessment and vaccination allocation plan). The four \nDMCs  conducted  needs  assessments  of  their  immunization  systems  for  the  introduction  of \nCOVID-19  vaccines through  the Vaccine  Introduction  Readiness Assessment Tool. The  World \nHealth Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, as well as ADB, supported these assessments in the \nareas of planning and coordination, vaccine procurement and financing, service delivery, training \nand supervision, cold chain, supply chain logistics, monitoring and evaluation, safety surveillance, \n\n7  More information on  UNICEF\u2019s procurement mechanism  is in Sector Assessment (Summary): Health (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8  All four countries benefited from development partner grant financing to support their COVID-19 responses in FY2020, \n\nwhich contributed to estimated surpluses. Fiscal deficits are projected to widen in FY2021.  \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fand  demand  generation.9 Country  needs identified  in the assessments\u2014e.g., strengthening  of \ncold  chains,  monitoring  and  surveillance  systems,  integrated  outreach,  and  community \nengagement\u2014are aligned to the support proposed under the additional financing, and indicative \nsupport from other development partners. The DMCs have also committed to prioritizing COVID-\n19  vaccines  access  for  vulnerable  groups  and  managing  medical  waste  from  vaccines \ndeployment in accordance with WHO guidelines. All four DMCs demonstrate compliance with the \naccess criteria of APVAX (Table 2).10 \n \n\nTable 2: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility  \n\nAccess Criteria \n1.

Established effective \ndevelopment partner \ncoordination mechanism \n\nADB Assessment \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse impacts in all four countries (para. 7). It \nis estimated to have increased poverty by 16%\u201345% in the four countries in 2020, \ncompared with pre-COVID-19 estimates.  Unemployment has risen and remittances \nhave dropped in 2020. The pandemic has impacted women through other channels \nas well, e.g., infection risk, gender-based violence, and increased burden of care. \nAll four countries have used WHO\u2019s Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment \nTool  to  complete  a  needs  assessment  that  identified  gaps  in  its  immunization \nsystems. The government will address these through their National Deployment and \nVaccination  Plans,  which  are  deemed  operationally  acceptable  for  needs \nassessments, readiness, and preparedness by the WHO. \nAll  four  countries  are  prioritizing  vaccine  access  for  frontline  workers,  high-risk \npopulations  with  elevated  risk  factors  (e.g.,  the  elderly,  and  those  with  co-\nmorbidities, disabilities, or special needs), in accordance with the values framework \nfor COVID-19 vaccine allocation of WHO\u2019s SAGE. \nAll four countries have detailed an incremental medical waste management plan in \naccordance  with  WHO\u2019s  Water,  Sanitation,  Hygiene  and  Waste  for  COVID-19 \nguidelines to manage waste management from COVID-19 vaccine deployment. \nAll  four  countries  have  submitted  to  ADB  a  Governor\u2019s  letter  reaffirming  their \ncommitment  to  implement  their  National  Deployment  and  Vaccination  Plans  and \ncompliance with the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria. \nAll  four  governments  have  established  a  national  coordinating  committee,  or \nequivalent,  to  coordinate  the  roll  out  of  COVID-19  vaccines  and  integrating \ndevelopment partner\u2019s contribution and support into the operational plan. ADB\u2019s role \nis to help finance the procurement of vaccine and provide technical assistance to \nsupport the implementation of the National Deployment and Vaccination Plans. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, APVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, \nSAGE = Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, WHO = World Health Organization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB  is  an  active  member  of  several  partner \ncoordination platforms. Development partners acted swiftly to support Pacific islands in mitigating \nCOVID-19  impacts.  Since  the  outbreak  of  the  pandemic,  development  support  has  been \ncoordinated through weekly meetings of the Joint Incident Management Team, chaired by WHO \nPacific, with subgroups to coordinate on specific technical areas of support, such as the vaccines \npillar  to  coordinate  the  introduction  of  the  COVID-19  vaccine.  Discussions  around  readiness \nassessments and technical support enabled Pacific DMCs to identify priority gaps, needs, and \nissues  in  planning  for  COVID-19  vaccine  procurement,  access,  and  delivery.  Development \npartners are also part of the partner coordination pillar to share opportunities for collaboration and \nfinancial  support  for  vaccines,  and  for  information  sharing  on  COVID-19  vaccine  initiatives.11 \nUnder  the  operational  support  and  logistics  pillar,  partners  such  as  ADB  provided  support  for \nmedical and personal protective equipment, supplies for testing through GeneXpert distribution, \n\n \n\n9 Vaccines Needs Assessments for Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n10 ADB. 2020.

The  additional  financing \napplies the eligibility criteria for ADB\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine support.12 The COVID-19 vaccines will \nbe procured under the project by UNICEF. They will be selected through COVAX on behalf of \nSamoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  vaccine  eligibility  criteria \n(footnote 12). This will ensure that vaccines being procured promote public health safety, reduce \ndeaths and disease burdens, and minimize societal and economic disruption from the pandemic. \nLetters from the four DMC governors are attached, confirming commitment to the implementation \nof each DMC\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination allocation plan and adherence to ADB\u2019s criteria for vaccine \nsupport.13  \n \n12. \nStrategic  alignment  and  modality.  The  overall  project  continues  to  be  aligned  with \nnational health strategies in all four DMCs, through its commitment to improving public health and \ninfection prevention control.14 It is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priorities of reducing poverty \nand  inequalities;  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  tackling  climate  change,  building \nclimate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity; and fostering regional cooperation and integration.15 It is \nalso consistent with the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 priority of managing risks through stronger \nhealth systems.16 The design of the additional financing follows the project investment component \nof  the  APVAX  policy,  and  the  project  applies  the  diligence,  access,  and  vaccine  eligibility \nrequirements, as well as the policy variations applicable to APVAX projects (Table 2). The project \nwill support the procurement of eligible COVID-19 vaccines, and help strengthen health systems \nand increase community awareness. Procurement will be through UNICEF, the lead procurement \nagency  under  COVAX.  All  vaccines  procured  by  UNICEF  should  conform  to  WHO  standards, \nsuch as prequalification, or be granted WHO's Emergency Use Listing.17 \n \nB. \n \n13.

The performance indicator is revised to include a \ntarget of COVID-19 vaccine coverage for 20% of the population. 20 This aligns with the allocation-\nper-population doses under COVAX. 21 \n \n14. \nOutput 1: Regional vaccine procurement strengthened. ADB will continue to support \nSamoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu in procuring the HPV and rotavirus vaccines as well as the \nPCV through UNICEF\u2019s VII. In Tonga, it will also finance the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine \nfrom  year  2  through  phased  counterpart  financing,  replacing  the  current  measles  and  rubella \nvaccine. 22 The original project is also supporting the procurement of cold chain equipment and \nassociated supplies, with performance, quality, and safety certification recommended by WHO \nand UNICEF; microplanning in at least 90% of health facilities; and national vaccine forecasting, \nwhich  includes  emergency  preparedness  planning  and  maintenance  of  a  buffer  stock. \nProcurement  capacity  building  will  contribute  to  more  effective  planning  and  procurement  of \nhealth  commodities.  Under  the  additional  financing,  this  output  will  be  expanded  to  include \n(i) procurement through UNICEF\u2014the lead procurement agency of COVAX-allocated COVID-19 \nvaccines  for  Samoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu\u2014when  one  of  the  APVAX-eligible  vaccines \nbecomes available through COVAX allocations;23 and (ii) the upgrade of cold chain capacities, as \nrequired,  to  accommodate  the  introduction  of  the  COVID-19  vaccine.  The  additional  financing \nproposed is to target the financing of any cost-shared COVID-19 vaccines to up to 20% of the \npopulation at the onset, in alignment with the 20% allocation under COVAX, with budget for up to \n70% of the population as COVAX-allocated doses are made available in the future. ADB has been \none of the leading financiers of routine vaccines in the four DMCs, and will aim to further expand \nthis support for the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines. \n \nOutput 2: Health systems strengthened. The overall project will continue to strengthen \n15. \nprimary  health  care  and  reduce  inequities  in  access  to  health  services.  The  original  project \nsupports  (i)  the  updating  of  immunization  and  cold  chain  policies,  guidelines,  and  training \nmaterials; (ii) the training of health workers through workshops and on-the-job practice in vaccine \nadministration, \nreporting,  waste  management,  preventive \nmaintenance, supportive supervision, and supply chain management with the aim of achieving \nless than 10% stockout nationally; (iii) capacity building of health staff in evidence-based planning \nand  bottom-up  budgeting  for  routine  integrated  outreach  with  an  equity  focus;  (iv)  sex-\ndisaggregated immunization reporting that is integrated in the broader health information system; \nand  (v)  evidence  generation  through  nationwide  immunization  coverage  surveys  and  other \nsurveys to assess the quality and equity of vaccine management. The additional financing will \nsupport  the  rollout  of  the  national  vaccine  deployment  plans,  including  the  revision  of  national \nimmunization  policies  and  guidelines  to  include  the  COVID-19  vaccine;  expanded  training  for \nvaccinators on the COVID-19 vaccine; microplanning to identify and target population segments \nfor the COVID-19 vaccine rollout; and supplementary immunization activities for rapid catch-up \ncampaigns.

In doing so, the team is building partnerships \nwith  other  ministries  (e.g.,  education  and  women\u2019s  affairs),  nongovernment  and  civil  society \norganizations, community and church leaders, and other local community groups. The additional \nfinancing  will  strengthen  community  engagement, \nthe  rollout  of \ncommunication  campaigns  on  infection  prevention  control,  demand  generation,  vaccine \nacceptance, as well as targeted risk communication on the national COVID-19 vaccine strategy \nto minimize potential vaccine hesitancy or misinformation.  \n \nC. \n \n17. \nSeveral development partners have committed to support Pacific island countries\u2019 access \nto COVID-19 vaccines. where UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank, and the governments of Australia \nand New Zealand are represented in COVAX, and supported the pooling of resources toward the \nAMC  for  the  development  of  a  COVID-19  vaccine.24  ADB\u2019s  project  provides  an  established \nplatform to introduce the COVID-19 vaccine in the four DMCs, which the additional financing can \nhelp secure. A COVID-19 vaccine will contribute to immunization as a regional public good and \npromote  collaboration  through  pooled  procurement.  ADB  is  coordinating  regional  knowledge \nsharing  on  the  development  of  COVID-19  vaccines  and,  as  of  16  March  2021,  had  approved \nabout $756 million, including in cofinancing and technical assistance, to support Pacific countries' \nresponse to the pandemic.25 These initiatives\u2014including the emergency procurement of essential \nmedical supplies and equipment, and direct support to multisector COVID-19 preparedness and \nresponse plans\u2014will complement the proposed introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine in mitigating \nand containing the spread of COVID-19 and accelerating recovery from the pandemic.26  \n  \nD. \n \n18. \nthe overall project is estimated to cost $49.48 million (Table 3). 27 \n \nThe  four  governments  have  requested  grants  not  exceeding  $8.00  million  (Samoa), \n19. \n$5.50 million  (Tonga),  $1.50  million  (Tuvalu)  and  $3.88  million  (Vanuatu)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) under the APVAX financing framework to help fund \nthe additional financing.

Project \nmanagement support will be provided by the already-appointed integrated project management \n(IPM) team, which will be expanded to provide additional support. UNICEF will continue to provide \nvaccine and cold chain procurement and expert services.  \n \n22. \nUnder  the  additional  financing,  UNICEF  will  support  COVID-19  vaccine  procurement, \nnational immunization planning, training, and risk communication, while WHO will be engaged to \nsupport monitoring and safety surveillance. The procurement of vaccines, cold chain equipment, \nand associated services will be carried out in accordance with UNICEF\u2019s Supply Manual and its \nHuman Resources Manual. 30 The additional financing will support the countries in strengthening \ntheir vaccine coverage monitoring, reporting, and surveillance by recruiting consultants provided \nthrough the IPM firm.  \n \n23. \nFor  goods  and  consulting  services  not  procured  or  recruited  through  UNICEF, \nprocurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), in \nalignment  with  the  original  project. 31\nn The  contracting  arrangements  put  into  place  under  the \ncurrent financing are fully adequate and will be maintained for the proposed activities under the \nadditional financing. As the project follows the access criteria, vaccine eligibility and due diligence \nrequirements established under the APVAX policy, the project also adopts the policy variations \napproved  under  the  APVAX  policy,  including  those  for  universal  procurement  and  retroactive \nfinancing.  The  continued  engagement  with  UNICEF  represents  value  for  money  due  to  their \norganization\u2019s strategic position for immunization support in the Pacific. \n \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in \n24. \nthe PAM (footnote 30).

Neighboring Pacific countries are likely to benefit from increased \nregional  immunization  coverage,  fewer  transboundary  infections,  and  improved  surveillance, \nwhich are all expected to contribute to regional cooperation and integration. \n \nA. \n \nThe additional financing will strengthen the countries\u2019 responses to health emergencies, \n26. \nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic, by helping supply a vaccine that will reduce the risk of getting \nthe life-threatening disease by disrupting the transmission chain and preventing its spread, and \nbuild a resilient health system to provide rapid access to vaccines. Investments in vaccines and \nimmunization programs are established as being a most cost-effective health measure, and are \ntimely given that many Pacific countries have remained free of confirmed COVID-19 cases. \n \n27. \nUNICEF  and  WHO  will  continue  to  support  the  four  DMCs  in  (i)  updating  or  revising \nnational immunization programs and public health policies;  (ii) upgrading cold chain capacities \nand supply chain networks, procurement capacity, information systems, and fiscal management \ncapacity in the health sector; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the respective MOHs. UNICEF \nand WHO have advised that each MOH has sufficient staff and logistics capacity to manage the \nintroduction of COVID-19 vaccines.  \n \n28. \nand technical support for the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines are aligned.32  \n \n\nADB is closely coordinating with development partners (para. 10) to ensure that financing \n\n \n\n   Health  coordination  meetings  include  the  participation  of  ADB,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  the  Pacific  Community, \nUNICEF,  WHO,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  Pacific  Community,  formerly  the  South  Pacific  Commission,  is  an \ninternational development organization owned and governed by 26 country and territory members, including Samoa, \nTonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. \n\n32\n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nB. \n \n29. \nEconomic  analysis.  Most  project  resources  will  be  allocated  to  the  procurement  of \nvaccines and health infrastructure upgrades (cold chain, health facility assets, and staff training). \nThese will translate into better health outcomes by reducing the burden of disease, and into long-\nterm cost savings and potential economic growth. The project has a pro-poor and equity focus by \nstrengthening health services in remote areas. The economic benefits accrue from (i) savings for \nhouseholds  from  less  out-of-pocket  spending  on  health  care,  and  (ii)  benefits  from  disability-\nadjusted life years saved. Given that the health-related nature of the project makes it difficult to \nquantify the monetary value of project benefits, a cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out. An \nincremental  cost-effectiveness  ratio  (dollars  per  disability-adjusted  life  year  averted)  was \ncalculated for each vaccine in each country. The addition of the COVID-19 vaccines to the rollout \nof the other three vaccines (para. 13) remains cost-effective for all four countries. 33 \n \n30. \nFinancial analysis. An updated project financial analysis was conducted in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines, and the project remains financially sustainable. 34 A financial viability analysis \nis not required for projects that do not include revenue-generating activities.  \n \nC. \n \nThe fiscal conditions in all four DMCs could worsen because of the COVID-19 pandemic, \n31. \nbut  in  a  review  mission  conducted  in  October  2020  the  governments  confirmed  that  their \ncounterpart funding remains manageable. The financial sustainability of the project will be sought \nthrough  measures  such  as  factoring  in  forecast  needs  for  routine  vaccines  and  cold  chain \nreplenishment in national health budgets, and phasing the financing of vaccine procurement. By \nexpanding preventive health care, the project will reduce future health costs. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nProject-related governance risks were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement \nand financial management requirements. 35 The recruitment of the IPM team with in-country and \nregional procurement specialists will mitigate the risk of MOH staff having limited procurement \ncapacity. Complex procurement actions under the project will be undertaken by UNICEF, which \nhas extensive experience in global vaccine procurement. The financial management risk rating is \nmoderate for Samoa and Tonga, substantial for Tuvalu, and high for Vanuatu. Detailed financial \nmanagement action plans have been developed to manage identified risks and ensure effective \nimplementation with the support of the IPM. The IPM will also help conduct independent biannual \nfiduciary reviews, provide targeted technical assistance to develop capacity for ADB procedures \nand financial monitoring, and establish separate project accounts. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n33. \nwith the ministries of finance and the ministries of health of Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \nThe policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n33  Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Results show \nan  incremental  cost\u2013effectiveness  ratio  of  between  1\u20133  times  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  across  all  four \ncountries, indicating that the vaccination program as a whole will remain cost-effective. \n\n34  ADB.  2019.

The  additional  financing  will  support  the  safe \nintroduction of a COVID-19 vaccine. This will particularly benefit women who are at increased risk \nof infection because of their roles as health workers (who will be prioritized for the vaccine), other \nfrontline workers, and carers. A reduction in mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases will bring \nsignificant socioeconomic benefits. A revised gender action plan was agreed with the respective \ngovernments to support the overall project outcome of increasing HPV vaccine coverage for girls \naged  9\u201314  years,  PCV  and  rotavirus  vaccine  coverage  for  birth  cohorts  of  both  sexes,  and \nCOVID-19  vaccine  population  coverage  targets. 36  Other  targets  include  (i)  gender-responsive \nmicroplans, (ii) training for at least 50% of female health providers on introducing and managing \nnew vaccines, (iii) gender-responsive community mobilization strategies, (iv) activities to promote \nadolescent  reproductive  health  with  gender  equity  considerations,  and  (v)  nationwide  sex-\ndisaggregated  immunization  reporting. 37  The  additional  financing  will  also  support  sex-\ndisaggregated vaccine surveillance data and gender-sensitive health promotion activities with a \nfocus on hand hygiene and infection control. 38 \n \nF. \n \n35. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the additional financing will \nretain  its  original  project\u2019s  categorization  of  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples.39 No physical works will be undertaken, so the additional financing will not \ncreate adverse environmental impacts. The overall project (i) will fund the management of waste \nfrom cold chain equipment and biomedical supplies, and support training on waste management; \nand (ii) will not introduce any additional risk to the occupational health and safety of health care \nworkers. The overall project will not cause any physical and economic displacement, or affect any \ndistinct  and  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  by  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. An assessment matrix was prepared, and no mitigation measure is required.F\n \nG. \n \n36. \nThe overall risk assessment is moderate for Samoa and Vanuatu, and low for Tonga and \nTuvalu.
