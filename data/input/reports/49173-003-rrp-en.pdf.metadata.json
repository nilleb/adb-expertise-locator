Rapid urbanization in Mongolia over the past 30 years has increased \nthe burden on the provision of health and social services in Ulaanbaatar and aimag centers. This \nhas  led  to  a  shortage  of  human  resources,  funding,  and  equipment;  and  obsolete  and  poorly \nfunctioning  health  facilities  that  weaken  the  accessibility,  quality,  and  equity  of  health  care \nservices. Poor urban infrastructure and weakened government capacity to provide basic social \nservices have exacerbated the situation. Ulaanbaatar has been the main destination for migrants \nfrom Mongolia\u2019s rural areas, and now hosts more than 50% of the country\u2019s population. About \n60%  of  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  population  lives  in  ger  areas,  with  limited  access  to  running  water, \nsanitation,  and  social  services,  including  primary  health  care  (PHC).  Access  to  health  care  is \nchallenging, especially for the poor. Out-of-pocket health expenses are high and account for 41% \nof  total  health  expenditure; 2  one-third  of  household  out-of-pocket  health  expenses  are  for \nmedicines because of high prices and the inappropriate use of drugs. Over 90% of the population \nhas health insurance coverage, but the benefit package is limited to hospital services, with the \nresult that the poor use health services 2.5 times less than the nonpoor. 3 In 2015, government \nexpenditure on health accounted for just 2.4% of gross domestic product, well below the 5% target \nof the World Health Organization. Addressing behavioral risk factors, particularly among men\u2014\nincluding obesity, alcohol and tobacco abuse, and gender-based violence\u2014and their associated \nhealth impacts remains a key challenge. 4 \n \n4. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been Mongolia\u2019s key health sector development \npartner  since  1993,  providing  five  loans  totaling  $84.90  million,  seven  grants  totaling                \n$37.00  million,  and  15  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  totaling  $10.65  million.  The  projects \nachieved  significant  results  through  comprehensive  health  system  support  and  strengthening, \nincluding for PHC reform and investments, information and communications technology, medicine \nand  pharmaceutical  procurement \ninsurance,  health \ninfrastructure,  human resources  for  health,  and sector  governance.  ADB  has  also  strategically \nsupported the drafting and enactment of key health policies and laws, including the Health Law \n(2016) and laws related to health insurance, medicines and medical devices, and medical care \nand services. 5 With support from ADB, Mongolia was able to achieve its Millennium Development \n\nreforms,  establishment  of  health \n\n \n\n1  Disadvantaged groups are those with limited access to basic socioeconomic services and have lower income. \n2  J.

It also \nmade significant progress toward the Millennium Development Goal targets of reducing poverty \nand malnutrition, and improving maternal health. \n \nfrom  both \n5. \ncommunicable and noncommunicable diseases, resulting in premature mortality and high levels \nof disability, which prevent the nation from fulfilling its economic potential. Economic growth since \n2001 has been strong, but one in five Mongolians still live below the national poverty line and face \nsignificant health care challenges that need to be addressed. \n \n6. \nInadequate  provision  and  quality  of  primary  health  care.  The  rapid  influx  of  rural \nmigrants  to  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  ger  areas  is  overwhelming  the  health  care  infrastructure  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity to provide health services. This is compounded by neglected laboratory \nand  diagnostic  services,  poor  facility  maintenance,  weak  human  resource  capacity,  and  an \nunregulated  private  sector  with  limited  quality  control.  The  quality  of  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  emergency \ncare service is a concern because of missing equipment and a deficient ambulance fleet. PHC in \nrural  areas  faces  challenges  resulting  from  scarce  financing  and  inadequate  maintenance. \nMongolia lacks integrated care models, resulting in poor coordination of primary and secondary \nhealth  care  services.  The  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  regulatory  framework  is  not  well-\ndeveloped and additional support is required to enable the private sector to be an important health \nservice provider. \n \n7. \nSecondary  health  service  needs.  No  district-level  hospital  service  investments  have \nbeen made since the 1980s, resulting in services that are inadequate and narrow in scope. District \nhospitals are unable to provide surgical and maternity services that meet national health service \ndelivery  standards,  and  are  often  poorly  maintained,  with  outdated  equipment  and  inadequate \nstaffing. Most of Mongolia\u2019s population cannot afford care at the few existing private hospitals. \n \nInefficient health financing system. Mongolia\u2019s input-based health financing model is \n8. \noutdated and inefficient, compromising service quality which fail to meet medium- and long-term \nsector  needs.  The  government  lacks  the  capacity  to  (i)  adequately  plan,  cost,  and  negotiate \nservices;  and  (ii)  move  toward  a  more  efficient  output-based  financing  model  based  on  the \npurchase of services. \n \n9. \nConstrained financial and  procurement  capacity.  The  Ministry  of  Health (MOH)  has \nweak financial and audit capability, and needs significant improvement in financial management, \naccountability, and transparency. Contract awards and disbursements are often delayed because \nof MOH\u2019s poor capacity to manage complex procurement processes such as those needed for \nlarge-scale health infrastructure. This is worsened by high staff turnover, new procurement rules, \nand outdated financial and audit systems. \n \n10. \nRoad map, policy framework, and strategic context. In response to these challenges, \nthe Government of Mongolia has developed an integrated road map that includes a sustainable \ndevelopment vision with a clear policy and regulations, and is developing a health sector master \nplan, 2019\u20132027. 6 Mongolia\u2019s Sustainable Development Vision 2030 confirms the government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  ensure  access  to  universal  health  coverage  (UHC)  through  the  provision  of \nequitable, accessible, and quality health services without financial hardship. 7 The State Policy on \nHealth, 2017\u20132026 outlines Mongolia\u2019s goals to extend average life expectancy by improving the \n\n6  ADB. 2017.

The  health  sector  master  plan  will  provide  a  platform  for  a \ncoordinated response that ensures effective use of public and private investments. \n \n11. \nThe strong health sector road map will enable Mongolia to move toward UHC, focusing \non strengthening of health systems supported by robust and well-anchored financing structures. \nIncreasing investments in quality PHC is the most cost-effective way to ensure improved access \nto essential health care. Mongolia plans to allocate at least 5% of gross domestic product and \n12% of government spending on health and limit patients\u2019 out-of-pocket expenditures to 25% of \ntotal health spending. Building on past experiences, ADB will continue to closely engage in policy \ndialogue to ensure a strong, resilient, sustainable, and responsive health system. The government \nwill  prioritize  other  critical  elements,  including  sound  procurement  systems,  the  supply  of \nmedicines  and  health  technologies,  and  well-functioning  health  information  systems.  Several \nMOH initiatives, including shifting to an output-based health financing system and strengthening \nof health sector governance, have contributed to ensuring access to essential packages of health \nservices  and  improving  the  implementation  of  the  health  insurance  scheme.  Health  sector \ninvestments in human capital and capacity improvements will have a positive effect on economic \ngrowth. The proposed ADB investment program will provide physical and nonphysical support to \nsix out of eight health policy areas and will (i) improve primary and secondary health care services, \nand  \n(ii) strengthen the government\u2019s health financing system and financial and procurement capacity. \n \n12. \nThe government\u2019s health sector road map is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nHealth, 2015\u20132020, which supports government efforts to achieve UHC by improving the use of \nand access to health services, quality of health care, and health financial risk protection. 9 The \ninvestment  program  will  support  the  implementation  of  ADB's  Strategy  2030  by  (i)  addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equity,  \n(iii) tackling climate change and enhancing environmental sustainability, (iv) making cities more \nlivable,  and  (v)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity. 10 It  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019\u20132021; and country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for \nMongolia. 11 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nThe investment program is aligned with the following impact: health status of Mongolians \nimproved  (footnote  8).

The program will establish \na  model,  gender-sensitive  district  hospital  in  Chingeltei  district,  and  upgrade  Khan  Uul  district \nhospital in Ulaanbaatar by functionally linking in- and outpatient services for surgery, obstetrics, \ngynecology,  and  other  disciplines.  LCT  energy  sources  will  be  installed  in  Khan  Uul  district \nhospital. Khovd and Uvs aimag hospitals will be expanded through a new outpatient department. \nPHC  services  will  be  improved  through  strengthening  hospital  autonomy  in  line  with  MOH \nregulations, and PHC management capacity will be enhanced.  \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Health  financing  system  strengthened.  The  program  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  health  staff  and  streamline  health  services  by  establishing  a  program  for  service \nquality monitoring, stewardship, and policy coordination for a strategic purchasing model involving \nthe  health  insurance  organization  (HIO),  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  the  MOH,  and  local \ngovernments  based  on  issued  regulations. 13 Institutional  capacity  will  be  developed  through  a \nprogram for systems performance analysis and evidence-based decision making at the MOH.  \n \n17. \nOutput 4: Procurement and financial management capacity of government health \nentities  strengthened.  The  program  will  support  a  continuous  capacity  building  program  for \nprocurement, financial, and risk management procedures for the government entities.  \n \n18. \nUse of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nefficiently  and  effectively  achieve  the  outcome. 14  The  government  has  a  sector  road  map \nconsistent  with  the  national  development  vision,  and  a  health  reform  framework 15 that  is  well-\naligned with the program. The investments are significant for the sector and will allow for a phased \napproach with a well-defined financial envelope. The MFF permits ADB to consolidate its long-\nterm  partnership  with  the  government  on  policy  dialogue  and  capacity  development,  improves \nreadiness for subsequent tranches, reduces transaction costs, and enhances sustainability. It will \ngenerate knowledge and lessons that will benefit the design of subsequent tranches and other \nhealth projects across ADB. Performance records and independent reviews of previous projects \nindicate that MOH can manage and complete the investments within the MFF availability period. \nThe MFF allows ADB to assist in implementation of the policy framework combing infrastructure \ninvestments,  policy  dialogue  and  sector  reforms  through  a  strategic  partnership  with  the \ngovernment. Table 1 outlines the proposed investment program. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n13  Strategic purchasing means active, evidence-based purchasing of health services (benefit packages) applying cost-\neffectiveness, optimal volume of services, and an appropriate provider mix (public and private) to maximize social \nbenefits. \n\n14 Comparison of Financing Modality (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  Government of Mongolia. 2016.

ADB  is Mongolia\u2019s  key  development  partner  in the  health \nsector;  other  partners  support  the  prevention  and  control  of  communicable  diseases  and  the \nimplementation  of  health  programs.  The  World  Bank  supports  digital  health,  while  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  Economic  Development  Cooperation  Fund  of  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  are  setting  up  tertiary  health  facilities.  MOH  chairs  the  sector  coordination \ncommittee,  which  aims  to  ensure  effective  coordination  and  synergies  between  development \npartners  and  key  stakeholders.  The  committee  also  provides  a  platform  for  improving \ncollaboration between public and private sector health operators. \n \nADB\u2019s value addition. Lessons learned from past ADB health sector projects in Mongolia \n21. \nhave been integrated into the proposed investment program. Recommendations from the project \nprocurement-related review (PPRR) 17 conducted in 2017 led to the introduction of a design and \nbuild procurement methodology to avoid implementation and disbursement delays for outputs 1 \nand  2.  Output  4  will  reinforce  a  good  governance  approach  to  manage  financial,  audit,  and \nprocurement  risks.  Key  innovations  in  output  3  include  helping  Mongolia\u2019s  HIO  focus  on \npurchasing rather than passively financing services. This will enhance equity in the distribution of \nresources, increase efficiency, manage expenditure growth, and promote quality in health service \ndelivery. The program will also introduce LCTs in health infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar, applying \nenergy-efficient  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  systems;  highly  insulated  windows; \nrooftop photovoltaic power generation; and ground source heat pumps. Innovative gender design \nfeatures  and  a  PPP  pilot  program,  which  will  outsource  medical  equipment  and  health  facility \nmaintenance, will also be introduced. ADB will provide complementary TA support for (i) preparing \nthe health sector master plan, 2019\u20132027; (ii) strengthening capacity on hospital autonomy; and \n(iii) building capacity on health financing. 18 \n \nC. \n \n22. \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 2). \n \n23. \nFinancing plan. The government has requested an MFF of up to $158.34 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance part of the investment program. The MFF will \nconsist of three tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing \nrequests, execution of the related loan agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and \nconditions and undertakings in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF \nwill  comprise  a  regular  loan  of  $66.14  million  and  a  concessional  loan  of  $10.00  million.  The \nregular loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6 years; an annual interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 15.75 years, \nand the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. The concessional loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the \n\nThe investment program is estimated to cost $163.51 million, including taxes and duties, \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n17  Project Performance Under Past Assistance Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Footnote 6; ADB. 2015.

The  climate  change \nmitigation  component  will  introduce  technology  already  familiar  in  Mongolia.  The  JFJCM grant \nincludes strategic capacity building to ensure the sustainability of the investment and continued \nsupport for operation and maintenance. The investment program has allocated enough resources \nfor capacity building. The three TA projects supported by ADB will also provide targeted capacity \nbuilding to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the MFF (footnotes 6 and 16). \n \nB. \n \n28. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  covers  30  years,  including  MFF  10-year \nperiod  from  2019  to  2029.  The  estimated  program  economic  benefits  from  improved  access \n(geographic  and  financial)  to  quality  health  care  include  avoided  loss  of  productive  life  years \nbecause  of  premature  death  and  permanent  disability,  savings  in medical  care  expenses,  and \nproductivity  gains  from  time  savings.  Other  economic  benefits  were  not  quantified  because  of \npractical constraints. The economic value of land is nearly zero. The program investments are \neconomically justified, and each tranche has an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) above \nthe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  6%,  based  on  a  total  project  financial  cost  of       \n$163.51 million. The base-case EIRR is from 13.5%\u201323.3%, while the EIRR for the overall project \nis 21.5%. A sensitivity analysis conducted by tranche and for the overall program indicates the \nEIRR remains robust under combined risk scenarios. The poverty impact ratio shows that 40% of \nthe economic benefits of the program will reach the poor, who comprise 27% of the country\u2019s total \npopulation; the program will therefore have a positive impact on poverty alleviation. \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The  program  has  no  revenue-generating  component,  and  the \n29. \nfinancial  sustainability  analysis  therefore  focused  on  the  fiscal  capacity  of  the  government  to \nfinance the counterpart funding and incremental recurrent costs after completion. The program \nwas found to be financially sustainable at the project level, because the average funds required \nduring MFF implementation (2019\u20132029) and throughout the program loan period (2019\u20132049) \nis at 1.45% of the annual budget forecast. This is within acceptable (2%\u20133%) limits as compared \nwith other programs of a similar nature. The total program requirements can be financed from the \nforecast unused budget balance, which has ranged from 3% (2017) to 10% (2012) of the approved \nannual budget. The predictability of the health care budget is low, which poses substantial risk. \nThis  has  historically  resulted  in  health  care  service  shortages  and  deficiencies,  and  inefficient \nhealth  care  system  financing.  To  ensure  project  sustainability,  the  government  has  agreed  to \nprovide assurances that operation, maintenance, and other required funding will be available on \na timely basis. Risks and mitigation measures are outlined in Table 5. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nThe  MFF  includes  capacity  development  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies, \nGPA,  and  program  implementation  unit  (PIU)  on  managing  (i)  risks  associated  with  delays  in \ncontract awards and disbursements; and (ii) risk associated with compliance with ADB\u2019s project \nmanagement;  procurement  procedures; safeguards  monitoring;  and  accounting,  reporting,  and \nauditing requirements. The financial management and procurement risk assessments concluded \nthat the financial management risk is substantial, the procurement risk is high, the internal and \nexternal audit functions are perceived to be weak, and the country and sector procurement risks \n\nGovernance \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nare high. Complex and high-value contracts are expected under the program. However, both the \nexecuting agency and the GPA will have adequate capacity to facilitate full compliance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Mitigation measures have been incorporated \ninto the program design (output 4) and their application will be closely monitored during program \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 19). \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe poverty and social analysis confirmed that all residents, including vulnerable groups \nin the program areas, will benefit from the proposed outputs. The program will create inclusive \nand gender-sensitive health services in the poorer and disadvantaged areas of Ulaanbaatar and \nin  selected  aimags  and  soums.  It  will  reduce  out-of-pocket  health  expenses  through  the \nimplementation  of  a  new  health  financing  model.  About  200,000  people  living  in  ger  areas  in \nUlaanbaatar (Khan Uul and Chingeltei districts) and 180,000 from the rural population (Khovd and \nUvs aimags and six selected soums) will directly benefit from the program. The social and gender \naction plan (SGAP) was prepared by ADB to ensure positive impact for all beneficiaries. 20 The \nprogram will enhance staff capacity of the FHCs and SHCs to better respond to the differentiated \nrisk  factors  and  specific  health  care  needs  of  different  vulnerable  groups,  including  the  poor, \nwomen, people with disability, and ethnic minorities. \n \n32. \nProject  1  is  classified  gender  equity  as  a  theme.  A  combined  SGAP  for  the  MFF  and \ntranche 1 was developed. Project 1 will (i) provide gender-sensitive and culturally respectful health \ncare services, (ii) create awareness and build capacity of staff on gender-based and domestic \nviolence  cases,  (iii)  identify  and  develop  gender-based  violence  guidelines  for  medical  staff  to \nidentify  and  refer  cases  to  FHCs,  (iv)  improve  the  capacity  of  FHCs  and  SHCs  to  provide \ngynecological services, (v) build the capacity of medical staff and communities on key risks related \nto noncommunicable diseases, and (vi) integrate gender dimensions in the design of the health \nfinancing model. The executing and implementing agencies will monitor the implementation of the \nSGAP and will provide periodic progress reports. A social development and gender specialist will \nassist the executing and implementing agencies in the effective implementation and monitoring \nof the SGAP. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nof project 1 are as follows. 21 \n \nEnvironment (category B). An initial environmental examination and an environmental \n34. \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  were  prepared  by  ADB  to  comply  with  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. 22 Subsequent tranches may be category B or C, but any activities that trigger category \nA are excluded from funding. Environmental impacts are anticipated during the construction and \ndemolition  of  structures,  including  dust  and  noise  from  earthworks,  transport,  and  handling  of \naggregate  materials  and  waste;  temporary  traffic  disturbances;  and  risks  to  community  and \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \n\nSafeguards \n\n20 SGAP of the MFF and Tranche 1; and Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of \n\n21 ADB. Safeguard Categories. Recategorization of safeguards will be undertaken for subsequent tranches. \n22 Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Including  Environmental  Management  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\foccupational  health  and  safety.  If  renovation  or  refurbishment  for  any  component  requires \nremoval  of  asbestos-containing  materials,  the  particular  activity  will  be  dropped  from  the  MFF \nprogram. Mitigation measures defined in the EMP, such as construction site management and \nregular monitoring of the project\u2019s environmental performance during construction and operation, \nwill  minimize  anticipated  impacts  and  reduce  other  construction-related  health  and  safety \nconcerns  to  acceptable  levels.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF) \nprovides guidance for selection, screening, and categorization; environmental assessment; and \npreparation  and  implementation  of  the  program\u2019s  environmental  safeguard  plans.  All  three \nprojects under the investment program must comply with EARF requirements to be eligible. The \nPIU and its environment and social safeguards specialist, assisted by implementation consultants, \nhave adequate capacity to implement mitigations required by the EMP for project 1, and the EARF \nfor subsequent projects 2 and 3. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C).
