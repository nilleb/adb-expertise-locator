It supports the RPJM\u2019s broad goal of stimulating \nhigher and sustainable economic growth (to 7% average annual growth \nby 2009 up from levels around 4% prior to 2004) and halving poverty (to \n8.2% by 2009 from 16.6% in 2004). To achieve these goals, the DPSP \nis  a  policy  engagement  tool  that  accelerates  economy-wide  and  cross \ncutting reforms.  More specifically, it has involved the implementation of \na set of policy actions in four core areas to (i) improve macroeconomic \nstability  and  creditworthiness;  (ii)  promote  investments;  (iii)  strengthen \nthe  financial  sector;  and  (iv)  enhance  the  quality  of  public  financial \nmanagement and reduce corruption. Supported by a $200 million single \ntranche  operation,  the  DPSP\u2019s  key  achievements  are  the  upfront \nimplementation  of  the  core  policy  actions,  and  the  development  and \nbuilding  of  full  Government  commitment  for  a  forward-looking  program \nthat deepens the reforms in the core areas, while striving to strengthen \npublic service delivery to the poor.  \n \nExiting  the  International  Monetary  Fund-supported  program,  to  ensure \npolicy  continuity  and  to  deepen  the  post-crisis  reforms,  in  a  period  of \npolitical transition leading up to the Presidential elections, in September \n2003  the  Government  announced  a  structural  reform  package  -  the \nWhite  Paper.  Recognizing  the  centrality  of  this  Paper,  the  principal \ndevelopment partners, including ADB, supported its formulation as well \nas  implementation.  ADB  specifically  focused  on  deepening  reforms  in \nfinance  and  governance,  building  on  post-crisis  sector  restructuring \noutcomes.  Substantial  ADB  technical  assistance  and  economic  and \nsector  work  supported  White  Paper  implementation.  In  parallel,  the \nWorld  Bank  supported  White  Paper  implementation  over  the  period \n2003\u20132004  with  a  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  (cofinanced  by  the \nGovernment of Japan).  The DPL framework has its origin in the World \nBank\u2019s  Country  Assistance  Strategy,  which  advocates  support  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s  macroeconomic  and  crosscutting  reforms  through  three \nsequentially designed DPLs.  \n \nBuilding on the White Paper and developing its own priorities, the new \nGovernment,  which  assumed  office  in  October  2004,  announced  the \nRPJM  for  2004\u20132009  in  November  2005.  The  RPJM  has  three \nobjectives:  peace  and  security,  justice  and  democracy,  and  prosperity \n\n\fthe \n\nstability, \n\ninvestment \n\nfor all. The Government has further instituted a system of annual work \nplans  (RKP),  approved  each  year  by  the  Cabinet  to  help  implement \nRPJM. \n \nTo  provide  effective  impetus  to  the  RPJM,  the  Government  requested \nthe  principal  development  partners,  at  the  Consultative  Group  on \nIndonesia  meeting  in  January  2005,  to  enhance  and  intensify  their \nmacroeconomic  and  sector  policy  engagement  structured  around  the \nRPJM.  In  response,  a  common  policy  agenda  was  developed  and \nagreed  upon  during  formulation  of  the  DPSP.  The  DPSP  serves  as  a \ntool  to  anchor  and  track  progress  in  four  principal  areas:  promoting \nmacroeconomic \nclimate, \nimproving \nstrengthening  the  financial  sector,  and  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement  and  anticorruption.  As  an  integral  part  of  the  DPSP,  the \nGovernment has shown strong commitment for forward-looking reforms \nto guide RPJM implementation during 2006\u20132009. \n \nThe DPSP aims to harmonize policy reform support of key development \npartners  by  providing  parallel  financing  with  the  World  Bank  and  the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  which  are  processing  a  second  phase  of  the \nDevelopment Policy Loan (DPL-2). The DPSP effectively builds on and \ndeepens  sector-specific  reforms  supported  by  ADB  through  past  and \nongoing operations. \n \nThe DPSP adheres to ADB\u2019s recent efforts to reduce transaction costs \nfor  its  developing  member  countries.  The  approach  is  also  consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  as  outlined  in  the  Long-Term  Strategic \nFramework,  Medium-Term  Strategy,  and  the  Middle-Income  Country \nInitiative. The DPSP helps implement and fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the \nRome  Declaration  on  harmonizing  procedures  of  multilateral \ndevelopment  banks  (February  2003)  and  the  recent  Paris  Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness (March 2005).   \n \nThe  DPSP  aims  to  (i)  achieve  and  sustain  higher  economic  growth \nthrough  improved  fiscal  management  and  investment  climate,  and \nenhancing  financial  sector  soundness;  and  (ii)  reduce  poverty  and \nunemployment  by  reorienting  public  expenditures  to  productive  needs, \nand by strengthening governance in public financial management. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  external  financing  needs  for  the  2005  budget  are \nestimated at $3.6 billion, comprising $1.25 billion in program loans \u2013 to \nsupport  the  reforms  \u2013  and  $2.35  billion  in  project  disbursements.  In \naddition  to  the  DPSP  support  of  $200  million,  the  Government  has \nrequested $400 million from the World Bank through DPL-2 and parallel \nfinancing  support  (amount  to  be  determined)  from  the  Government  of \nJapan. \n \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n\fiii \n\nA  single-tranche  program  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options that may be exercised \nin accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement. \n \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of loan \neffectiveness. \n \nThe DPSP period is from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2006. All actions \nincluded in the Policy Matrix have been implemented during the course \nof  2005.  The  DPSP  fits  within  the  overall  reform  agenda  supported \nunder the DPLs, which covers 2003\u20132007. \n \nMinistry of Finance \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport  documentation  will  be  required,  if,  during  each  year  when  loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports, \nand  imports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is \nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe key benefits expected from the DPSP are \n \n(i)  progress  toward  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \nmacroeconomic stability and creditworthiness; improved investment \nclimate, reduced corruption, and improved governance; \n\n \n(ii)  consolidation  of  recent  macroeconomic  and  policy  reforms  leading \nto  the  formulation  of  a  credible  medium-term  public  expenditure \nframework, backed by measures to curtail wasteful public spending; \n\n \n(iii) institutional  development  within  Government  institutions,  Bank \n\nIndonesia, and banks; \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \nRisks and Mitigating \nMeasures \n\niv \n\n \n\n(iv) greater public confidence in the banking system stemming from the \n\nintroduction of the deposit protection scheme; \n\n \n(v)  sustained ADB engagement in policy dialogue with the Government \non  the  direction  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic, \nstructural, and institutional reform agenda - with the DPSP providing \nfor  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in  sectors  where  ADB  has \nbeen actively involved; \n\n \n(vi) facilitation, through cross-cutting reforms, of sector-specific reforms \n\nin areas where ADB is providing or planning support; and  \n\n \n(vii) harmonization  and  parallel  financing  by  the  key  development \npartners  (ADB,  World  Bank,  and  Government  of  Japan)  around  a \ncommon  policy \nthe  resulting \nendorsement of the Government\u2019s sound policy implementation and \nmacroeconomic management. \n\nframework  and  dialogue,  and \n\n \nThe DPSP is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i)  Economic  volatility  may  increase  if  the  Government  does  not \nsustain the reform momentum to follow up on the recent reduction in \nfuel  subsidies  (including  maintaining  appropriate  interest  rates  and \ninvestment climate reforms). This risk is mitigated by the clear policy \nstance  taken  thus  far  by  the  Government  and  Bank  Indonesia. \nFollowing  the  recent  currency  market  volatility,  the  need  for  rapid \npolicy  adjustment  on  the  domestic  front  in  line  with  key  global \ndevelopments is now clearly recognized. \n\n \n(ii)  Rising interest rates may trigger financial stress in debt markets with \ncontagion  effects  on  banks  and  mutual  funds.  In  turn,  this  may \naffect growth prospects.  \n\n \n(iii) Increased  social  tensions  could  result  from  the  reduction  of  fuel \nsubsidies announced on 1 October 2005. Thus far no major protests \nhave  been  experienced;  the  success  of  the  ongoing  unconditional \ncash transfers program is vital in containing public disenchantment. \nThis  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s  focus  on  ongoing \nevaluation of this program, with ADB support. The Government also \naims  to  formulate  a  broad-based  public  expenditure  reorientation \nprogram; an area where ADB is actively involved. \n\n \n(iv) The external environment may deteriorate, if high oil-prices continue \nresulting  in  a  slowdown  in  world  economic  growth  and  trade,  and \nunfavorable \nfinancial  markets.  The \nin  world \nGovernment\u2019s  October  2005  policy  package  provides  for  attracting \ninvestments  in  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  which  in  turn  will  help \nIndonesia  effectively  manage  its  natural  resources  and  reap  the \nbenefits of any windfall gains.  \n\nconditions \n\n \n(v)  Heightened  security  alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional \nconflicts, and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment and set \nback the recovering tourism industry. \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP). The DPSP \nsupports  the  common  development  policy  agenda  as  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of  the \nGovernment of Indonesia (the Government), Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and \nGovernment of Japan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nDevelopment Strategies and Plan \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  September  2003,  the  Government  prepared  a  White  Paper,  setting  forth  broad-\n2. \nranging  macroeconomic  and  sector  reforms,  to  provide  policy  continuity  and  bridge  any \ncredibility  gap  to  emerge  after  Indonesia\u2019s  exit  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)-\nsupported  program,  as  well  as  during  the  political  transition  leading  to  elections  in  2004.  The \nnew  Government,  which  assumed  office  in  October  2004,  announced  the  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (RPJM) for 2004\u20132009 in November 2005. The RPJM has three objectives: \npeace  and  security,  justice  and  democracy,  and  prosperity  for  all.  The  Government\u2019s  annual \nwork plan (RKP), approved each year by the Cabinet, guides RPJM implementation. The RKP \nfor  2006  has  seven  priority  areas  to:  reduce  poverty  and  disparity,  increase  employment, \nrevitalize  agriculture, \nto  and  quality  of  education,  reduce  corruption, \nstrengthening defense capacities, and rehabilitate and reconstruct Aceh and Nias (Figure 1).  \n \n\nimprove  access \n\n \nFigure 1: Links between Indonesia\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan, \nAnnual Work Plan, and the Development Policy Support Program \n\nObjective 3\nA Prosperous \nIndonesia \n\nObjective 1 \nA Safe and Peaceful \nIndonesia \n\nObjective 2\nA Just and Democratic \nIndonesia \n\nRPJM\nMedium-Term Development Plan \n(3 objectives addressing 33 policy areas) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    Dotted boxes signify areas supported by the Development Policy Support Program. \n \n \n \nNote: Dotted boxes signify areas supported by the Development Policy Support Program. \nSource: National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas). \n\nPriority 5 \nEradication of \ncorruption, \nbureaucracy reform, \nlaw enforcement \n\nRKP\nAnnual Work Plan \n(7 priority areas in 2006) \n \n\nPriority 6\nStrengthening \ndefense capacity, \nsecurity and order, \nconflict resolution\n\nPriority 4\nImproving access \nand quality of \neducation and \nhealth services \n\nPriority 7\nRehabilitating and \nreconstructing \nAceh and Nias \n\nPriority 2 \nEmployment \nopportunities, \ninvestments, \nexports \n\nPriority 3\nRevitalizing \nagriculture \nand rural \ndevelopment \n\nPriority 1 \nReduction of \npoverty and \ndisparity \n\n(\ni\nn\n \nd\nr\na\nf\nt\n)\n\nS\nN\nP\nK\n\n \n\nN\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \n\nS\n\nt\nr\na\nt\ne\ng\ny\n \nf\no\nr\n \n\nP\no\nv\ne\nr\nt\ny\n \nR\ne\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n \n\n\f 2 \n\n \n\nlegal  and  regulatory  reforms \n\nIn  its  first  year,  the  new  Government  continued  the  fiscal  consolidation  process; \n3. \nlaunched  substantive \nfor  strengthening  decentralization, \ninvestment,  and  the  infrastructure  sectors;  and  reinvigorated  the  campaign  against  corruption, \nincluding pursuit of several high-profile cases. Efforts to address constraints in decentralization \nand the public expenditure program are aimed to reduce poverty and accelerate attainment of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Notably, the Government has maintained a strong \nfocus  on  its  medium-term  development  priorities,  despite  the  massive  devastation  and \ndisruption caused by the December 2004 earthquake and tsunami. \n \n4. \nTo  provide  effective  impetus  to  the  RPJM,  the  Government  requested  the  principal \ndevelopment  partners,  at  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia  meeting  in  January  2005,  to \nenhance  and  intensify  their  macroeconomic  and  sector  policy  engagement  structured  around \nthe RPJM. In response, a common policy agenda was developed and agreed upon during the \nformulation  of  the  DPSP.  The  DPSP  serves  as  a  tool  to  anchor  and  track  progress  in  three \nprincipal  areas:  promoting  macroeconomic  stability,  improving  the  investment  climate,  and \nstrengthening public financial management and anticorruption.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nGiven  the  close  alignment  between  its  own  reform  agenda  and  the  DPSP,  the \nGovernment has shown its absolute ownership and commitment and engaged in policy dialogue \nin  a  seamless  manner  throughout  DPSP  formulation  and  implementation.  The  Government\u2019s \nownership of the DPSP policy agenda is underscored by its development policy letter addressed \njointly to the Presidents of ADB and the World Bank (Appendix 2). \n \n6. \nThe DPSP and the Development Policy Loans. The World Bank\u2019s Country Assistance \nStrategy (CAS) lays out the rationale and justification for a series of Development Policy Loans \n(DPL),  subject  to  progress  in  (i)  improving  macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness;  (ii) \nimproving the investment climate; (iii) accelerating governance and anticorruption reforms; and \n(iv)  improving  service  delivery  to  the  poor.  Sequentially,  the  process,  led  fully  by  the \nGovernment, has three phases:  \n \n\nThe DPSP \u2013 the Government and Development Partnership \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nDPL-1,  financed  by  the  World  Bank  ($300  million  approved  in  December  2004) \nwith  parallel  financing  from  the  Government  of  Japan  ($100  million  approved  in \nearly  2005),  supported  the  Government\u2019s  White  Paper  reforms  and  President \nYudhoyono\u2019s  \u201c100-Day  Plan\u201d.  In  parallel,  ADB  supported  the  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  the White  Paper  through  reforms  in  finance  and  governance, \nbuilding on post-crisis sector restructuring outcomes.1   \n\nDPL-2/DPSP, a product of joint missions and financing of the World Bank ($400 \nmillion),  ADB  ($200  million),  and  the  Government  of  Japan  (support  being \ndetermined),  was  activated  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  DPL-2  and \nCAS  triggers  (Appendixes  2  and  3).  The  DPL-2  focuses  on  the  first  three \nprincipal focus areas of the CAS: macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, \n\n                                                 \n1   Key  initiatives  implemented  during  2003\u20132004  include  (i)  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform \nProgram,  State-Owned  Governance  and  Privatization  Program,  and  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  Small  and \nMedium  Enterprise  Development  Program;  and  (ii)  policy  dialogue  to  strengthen  national  and  local  government \npublic  financial  management,  leading  to  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (SDP)  and  State  Audit  Reform  SDP.  These  programs  built  on  the  crisis-recovery  support \ninitiatives that included Financial Governance Reform SDP, the Community and Local Government Support SDP, \nand the Social Protection SDP. \n\n\f  \n\n3\n\ninvestment climate, and public financial management. This operation is anchored \non  the  RPJM,  RKP,  and  emerging  policy  statements  of  the  Government,  which \nhave  built  on  the  reform  achievements  of  White  Paper.  The  DPL-2  formulation \nhas  benefited  from  the  analytical  support  of  the  development  partners,  and  is \nbuilt on recent and ongoing ADB operations (footnote 1). At a technical level, the \nDPSP  draws  on  the  analyses  in  ADB\u2019s  Governance  Assessment,  draft  Country \nPoverty  Analysis,  draft  Private  Sector  Assessment,  and  technical  assistance \nprojects on anticorruption.2 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nDPL-3 (the forward-looking phase of DPSP) is to be activated by a host of new \ntriggers  (Section  III)  to  sustain  the  DPL-2  agenda  through  continuous  policy \nengagement and deepen reforms within the three pillars of DPL-2, while adding a \nmajor component to help improve public service delivery.  \n\n \n7. \nThe DPSP  and ADB\u2019s  Strategy. The DPSP is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s emerging country \nstrategy and program for 2006\u20132010. Under this, a dual-track approach is proposed to ensure \ncontinuity  and  sustainability  of  past  ADB-supported  initiatives.  This  would  involve  structuring \nADB support through (i) participation in the DPLs to strengthen the macroeconomic and fiscal \nframework and address cross-cutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy interventions. For \nexample, in 2005, ADB launched upfront partnerships with the World Bank and the Government \nof Japan to develop a conceptual framework and design for infrastructure sector reform. All key \ndevelopment partners have a policy engagement in areas covered in the ADB-supported Local \nGovernment  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector  Development  Program,3  which  provides \nan overall umbrella for decentralization policy reforms. Joint technical work is underway by both \nthe ADB and the World Bank on poverty reduction and acceleration of MDGs.  \n \n8. \nThe proposed ADB parallel financing support for the DPL (through the DPSP) and ADB-\nsupported and coordinated sector-specific interventions are among the key holistic attempts to \nalign  and  harmonize  development  partner  strategies  with  Indonesia\u2019s  country  strategy  and \npriorities.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  DPL  process  and  the  parallel  policy  dialogue  on  sector \nreforms has been appreciated by Government. Over the medium-term, the dual-track approach \nwill  help  reinforce  reforms  under  both  streams  and  facilitate  close  coordination  among \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n9. \nLinkage  of  DPSP,  DPLs  and  RPJM.  The  DPSP,  building  on  DPL-1,  is  anchored  on \nDPL-2  and  DPL-3  with  enhancement  to  capture  ADB\u2019s  continued  policy  engagement  in  the \nfinancial  sector.  The  policy  dialogue  and  fact-finding  missions  for  the  DPSP  were  an  ongoing \nprocess  that  culminated  in  a  policy  matrix,  which  was  firmed  up  during  the  joint  Appraisal \nMission in November 2005.4 The DPSP covers policy actions implemented during 2005, with the \nanticipation  of  continuous  engagement  over  2006\u20132007  to  support  the  next  phase.  Figure  2 \npresents the DPSP framework, and its linkage with the RPJM and the DPLs. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2004.

The  policy  components  and  actions  of  the \nDPSP are sequenced and paced to accommodate the prevailing political economy of Indonesia, \nwhere the legislature must fully buy into the agenda, where it takes time to ensure stakeholder \nownership  and  effective  implementation.  Harmonization  of  strategies  of  development  partners \naround the Government\u2019s own program has bolstered further country ownership of the reforms \nand has helped forge a new relationship between the Government and its principal development \npartners.  Further,  harmonization  around  the  reform  programs,  such  as  the  DPLs  and  ADB-\nsupported  sector  reform  initiatives,  builds  on  the  natural  synergy  and  complementarities  that \nexist  among  the  development  partners.  Combining  the  strengths  and  expertise  of  each  of  the \ndevelopment  partners  has  helped  ensure  quality  and  consistency  of  advice  and  reduce  the \ntransaction cost of policy dialogue. \n \nC.  \n \n11. \nIndonesia\u2019s track record of economic management in recent years has been consistent \nand  positive.  During  2001\u20132004,  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  steadily  and  fiscal \nconsolidation  was  impressive,  with  the  budget  deficit  declining  from  minus  3.2%  of  GDP  to \nminus  1.1%,  a  reduction  of  about  2.1%.  Effective  monetary  management  stabilized  inflation, \ninterest rates, and the exchange rate (around Rp9,500); and foreign exchange reserves rose to \nabout  $35  billion.  The  real  GDP  in  the  first  half  of  2005  grew  by  5.9%  driven  by  strong \ninvestment growth,5 reversing the earlier consumption-led growth pattern, as reflected in the rise \nin  import  of  capital  goods  and  accelerating  growth  in  the  nontradable  sectors.  Despite  strong \nexport growth, the rise in imports due to adverse developments in the oil and gas sector led to a \nrise  in  the  external  current  account  deficit.  The  combination  of  these  events  resulted  in  a \ncumulative drawdown of foreign exchange reserves by nearly $6 billion in the past few months, \nto $32 billion in September 2005.  \n \n12. \nA  few  disturbing  trends  underlie  this  favorable  economic  picture.  Until  recently,  growth \nhas been primarily consumption led, with investment levels declining. Fiscal compression at the \nthe  challenges  of  decentralization,  precipitated  by  weak \nnational \nintergovernment fiscal relations and lack of effective onlending arrangements for assistance to \nlocal governments, have affected the quantity and quality of public service delivery. \n  \nEconomic outcomes in 2005 have been further impacted by the (i) preoccupation in the \n13. \nfirst  quarter  of  2005  with  rescue,  recovery,  and  rehabilitation  efforts  in  Aceh,6  which  delayed \neconomywide  reforms;  and  (ii)  sharp  rise  in  international  oil  prices  and  higher  than  projected \nfuel imports.7 The latter increased the fuel oil subsidy bill from Rp34 trillion (based on $24 per \nbarrel  oil  price)  to  around  Rp110  trillion  (based  on  $54  per  barrel).  Uncertainty  about  the \ntimetable  for  the  gradual  removal  of  fuel  subsidies  created  short-term  economic  volatility  in \nfinancial markets. Global interest rate pressures and slow adjustments of domestic interest rates \ngenerated instability in exchange markets causing the rupiah to depreciate to Rp11,400 to the \ndollar  in  early  September  2005.  Subsequent  adjustments  in  interest  rates  and  the  sharp \nreduction in fuel subsidies have helped stabilize the exchange rate, though inflation spiraled in \nOctober (para.36).8  \n \nAgainst this background, Indonesia has managed to achieve some progress in reducing \n14. \npoverty. Recent household survey data indicate that poverty incidence has fallen from the peak \nat  23.4%  (or  48  million  people)  in  1999,  back  to  the  pre-crisis  levels  of  16.7%  (or  36  million \n                                                 \n5   Investment levels have now grown by more than 10% for six straight quarters since March 2004, the longest period \n\nlevel,  coupled  with \n\nof sustained growth since the late 1980s. \n\n6   On a positive note, the disaster provided impetus to signing of a peace pact with the Free Aceh Movement. \n7   This was due to declining domestic production coupled with rising domestic consumption. \n8   Such measures may have an adverse impact on economic growth in the near term, before the full benefits of any \n\npublic expenditure reorientation programs (using fuel subsidy savings) are felt. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\npeople) by 2004. However, considerable geographic variations remain.9 The poverty trends and \ntheir regional distribution indicate that Indonesia faces major challenges in designing its public \nexpenditure programs and in ensuring that the benefits of growth reach the poor, in both rural \nand urban areas (Table 1).  \n \n\nTable 1: Proportion and Number of Poor  \n\nYear \n\nProportion of Poor People (%)  \n\nNumber of Poor People (million) \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\nTotal \n\nUrban \n\nRural \n\nTotal \n\n1999 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n19.4 \n\n14.5 \n\n13.6 \n\n12.1 \n\n26.0 \n\n21.1 \n\n20.2 \n\n20.0 \n\n23.4 \n\n18.2 \n\n17.4 \n\n16.7 \n\n15.6 \n\n13.3 \n\n12.2 \n\n11.4 \n\n32.3 \n\n25.1 \n\n25.1 \n\n24.7 \n\n47.9 \n\n38.4 \n\n37.3 \n\n36.1 \n\na  A new poverty measurement methodology was applied beginning in 1996. Data for all subsequent years are based \n\non this new method, and cannot be compared with pre-1996 estimates.  \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nSource: Maksum, Choiril. 2004. Official Poverty Measurement in Indonesia. Indonesia: Central Bureau of Statistics. \n \nD. \n \n15.  While the Government has embarked on a program of bold reforms, the reforms are far \nfrom  being  complete.  The  unfinished  reform  agenda  has  provided  the  opportunity  for  the \ndevelopment partners to lend support through a series of forward-looking interventions targeting \nspecific areas. \n \n16.  Macroeconomic  and  Fiscal  Policies.  Stringent  fiscal  policy  has  helped  reduce  the \nbudget deficit but has squeezed development spending, which sharply declined after the onset \nof the crisis and stagnated at 2\u20133% of GDP during 1998\u20132005, as compared with 7\u20138% prior to \n1997. Over the same period, recurrent expenditures declined from about 12% of GDP to about \n9%.  In  2004,  public  expenditures  came  under  renewed  pressures  as  the  fuel  subsidies \nincreased to 3.5% of GDP, leaving less than Rp80 trillion for development expenditures. Despite \nbeing an oil-producing country, Indonesia has not been able to reap any significant gains from \nthe  favorable  global  oil  market  environment  due  to  lack  of  investments  in  oil  exploration  and \ndevelopment. \n  \n17. \nIn proportional terms, the approved 2005 budget allocations present a similar picture to \nthat  of  2004,  with  revised  fuel  subsidies  estimated  at  about  Rp89.5  trillion,  leaving  limited \nresources  for  development  needs.  Nonetheless,  the  recent  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies  has \nprovided  the  Government  with  significant  scope  to  reorient  public  expenditures  to  achieve  the \nGovernment\u2019s dual goal of accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nTax  Framework.  Businesses  are  required  to  file  seven  different  types  of  tax  returns \n18. \nevery month. Based on a recent survey undertaken by the World Bank, firms devote on average \n45 person-days each month for this purpose. Indonesia must move to a more streamlined tax-\nfiling  system.  Delayed  tax  refunds  impose  a  major  burden  on  firms,  particularly  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  since  advance  tax  payments  tie  up  a  large  amount  of \nworking capital. Value-added tax (VAT) refunds alone take an average of 5 months. \n \n                                                 \n9   Eastern parts of Indonesia continue to have the highest poverty incidence in relative terms. In absolute terms, over \nhalf  of  Indonesia's  poor  reside  in  East  Java  (7.3  million),  Central  Java  (6.8  million),  and  West  Java  (4.7  million). \nSeven  other  provinces  account  for  another  25%  of  the  poor:  North  Sumatra  (1.8  million),  Lampung  (1.6  million), \nSouth Sumatra (1.4 million), South Sulawesi (1.2 million), Aceh (1.2 million), East Nusa Tenggara (1.2 million), and \nWest Nusa Tenggara (1.0 million). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n19. \nDebt  Management.  The  Government  has  managed  to  gradually  decrease  the  level  of \ndebt over the last few years, from 91% of GDP in 2000 to 52% by mid-2005. The overall debt is \nprojected to decline to about 30% of GDP by 2010. Debt sustainability analysis, undertaken by \nthe World Bank and IMF, indicate that both external and domestic public debt is fairly robust to \nshocks  in  exchange  rates,  interest  rates,  and  GDP  trends.  However,  considering  that  slightly \nmore than half of the outstanding debt, or about $66 billion, is denominated in foreign currency, \nlong-term,  and  owed  to  noncommercial  lenders,  one  of  the  main  risks  facing  Indonesia  is \nexchange rate risk. Recent trends in interest rates and the move to issue sovereign bonds are \nto  eventually  magnify  interest  rate  risks.  The  Government  needs  to  adopt  a  clear  strategy  to \nmanage such risk as it pursues its strategy to gradually reduce overall debt. \n \n20. \nInvestment  Constraints.  After  years  of  declining  investments,  signs  of  recovery  are \nevident, although continued low investments remain a concern. The weak legal and regulatory \nframework  for  investment,  problems  of  interpretation  and  application  of  the  law  and \nenforceability  of  contractual  obligations  have  led  to  high-profile  and  high-value  investment \ndisputes, some of them concluded in favor of vested interests and involving bankruptcy litigation \nagainst  well-known  companies  with  foreign  shareholding.  The  approval  process  for  foreign \ninvestments  by  the  Investment  Coordinating  Board  is  protracted.  Indonesia  lags  other  Asian \ncountries in this area: it takes 80\u2013151 days on average to register and establish a locally owned \nlimited liability company in Indonesia, compared to 56 days in Viet Nam, 41 days in the People's \nRepublic  of  China,  and  30  days  in  Malaysia.  Nontransparent  processes  leave  scope  for \ndiscretion in verification and approval of investment applications, and corruption.10\n \n21. \nInfrastructure  Development.  While  infrastructure  investments  in  Indonesia  exceeded \n5% of GDP prior to the financial crisis, they have subsequently fallen and not recovered beyond \n2-3% of GDP. Public service provision and coverage are low across all sectors, but particularly \nlow in telecommunications, roads, power, and water supply and sanitation, and in areas outside \nJava,  resulting  in  widening  economic  and  social  disparities.  The  Government  estimates  the \ninfrastructure investment requirements at around $145 billion for 2005\u20132009. It further estimates \nthat  only  17%  can  be  financed  from  the  national  budget,  and  7%  by  official  development \nassistance, which will be largely used for promoting public-private partnerships. This means that \nthe bulk of the requirements will have to be met by private capital. The infrastructure financing \nconstraints are aggravated by the lack of depth and diversification in the financial system, which \ndoes not provide long-term capital.  \n \n22. \nInvestors  are  concerned  about  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  distortions  in  the \ninfrastructure  sectors,  and  face  country  risks  as  recourse  to  the  judicial  system  is  weak. \nAlthough a number of projects that halted after the crisis have been renegotiated, gaps in sector \npolicies  and  recent  adverse  outcomes,  such  as  the  annulment  of  the  Electricity  Law  by  the \nConstitutional  Court  in  December  2004  have  negatively  affected  investor  confidence.  Lack  of \nstrong  coordination  across  sector  ministries  also  adversely  affects  infrastructure  investment. \nThe  National  Committee  for  the  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure  Development  (KKPPI)  has  been \nestablished  and  strengthened  through  a  Presidential  Decree  in  2005,  but  it  needs  strong \ntechnical and administrative support to function as an effective coordination mechanism. Due to \nthe  legal  and  country  risks,  the  Government  needs  to  adopt  a  risk-sharing  mechanism  to \nmitigate  against  the  legal  and  regulatory  uncertainties  faced  by  investors.  Transaction  quality \nneeds to be ensured by thorough project preparation and transparent bidding process. There is \na  need  for an  effective  mechanism  for  an  independent  and  impartial  review,  roles  that  can  be \nplayed only by a strong KKPPI. \n \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005. Improving the Investment Climate in Indonesia. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n23. \nFinancial  Sector.  Indonesia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  stabilized  but  continues  to  exhibit \nstructural  vulnerabilities  and  risks.  The  financial  performance  of  Indonesia\u2019s  banks  is \ncomparable  or  better  than  other  developing  countries  in  the  region  and  gross  nonperforming \nloan ratios have declined over time from above 12% in 2001 to 7% by mid-2005, although some \nlarge  state-owned  commercial  banks  continue  to  carry  large  nonperforming  loans.  Financial \nintermediation is increasing, although its growth is impacted by upward pressure on interest rate \nand credit and operational risks in the system. Banks have as yet not fully adopted sound risk \nmanagement systems. Recent scandals in some banks\u2014including large state-owned banks as \nwell as smaller, reasonably well-managed private banks\u2014manifest weak corporate and financial \ngovernance  practices.  Lack  of  an  effective  financial  safety  net  and  liquidity  support  for  the \nbanking system pose a systemic risk to the system.11 Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) still \naccount  for  a  relatively  low  16%  of  total  financial  assets.  While  the  Indonesian  capital  market \nhas been the best performing in the region and equity market capitalization registered triple-fold \ngrowth in recent years, issues of breadth and depth of the market and enforcement of regulation \nand supervision remain a concern. The long-term debt market has been constrained by delays \nin  pension  and  insurance  sector  reforms.  The  financial  sector  lacks  innovation,  both  at  the \ninstitution and product level. Much of the liquidity is locked up in Government bonds.  \n  \n24. \nFinancial  Management  and  Anticorruption.  The  key  concerns  in  public  financial \nmanagement  are  (i)  an  outdated  legal  environment;  (ii)  an  opaque  and  inefficient  budget \nformulation process, and the separation of recurrent and development budgets; (iii) an inefficient \npayments  system  and  weak  monitoring  arrangements;  (iv)  fragmented  cash  management \narrangements;  (v)  unreliable  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting  systems;  and  (vii)  overlaps \nbetween external and internal audit agencies, reflecting unclear roles and responsibilities. Public \nand  investor  perception  surveys  (such  as  those  by  Transparency  International)  indicate  that \ncorruption is evident at all levels in the public sector. Legal and regulatory uncertainty in most \nsectors  acts  as  a  major  impediment  to  good  governance.  Public  procurement  remains  a \nchallenging  area  of  reform;  malpractices  here  have  impeded  development  spending.  The \nPresident  has  made  corruption  eradication  a  top  priority,  and  the  establishment  of  the \nCorruption  Eradication  Commission  (KPK)  has  brought  new  hope.  Persistence  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s anticorruption efforts and sound enforcement will be vital to reducing corruption in \npublic life.  \n \nE. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n25. \nThe role of adjustment lending as a vehicle for economic growth and poverty reduction \nhas  come  under  scrutiny  by  a  number  of  task  forces  and  studies.12  This  body  of  analytical \nliterature  agrees  that  adjustment  lending,  originally  conceived  as  a  financing  vehicle  for  short-\nterm balance of payments or budget support, has also evolved into an important development \ninstrument  for  supporting  economic,  social,  and  sector  reforms,  especially  in  middle-income \ncountries.  \n \n26. \nEarly  adjustment  lending  had  a  mixed  performance  record.  The  concerns  stem  largely \nfrom  the  evidence  that  past  reform  programs  were  structured  around  unrealistic  and  rigid \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nconditions  that  were  prescriptive  but  not  well  grounded  on  country  circumstances  or  sound \nassessment of ownership and institutional capacities. At the same time, conditions tended to be \nnumerous and not well prioritized. Rigid reform conditionalities by themselves cannot lead to the \nadoption  of  effective  policies  in  absence  of  consensus  and  ownership  of  reform.  Rather  than \nbeing prescriptive, conditionalities should be based on good diagnostic and analytical work and \ngeared  to  evolving  country  circumstances  and  structured  around  open  and  informed  debate \nabout policy reform. \n \n27.  Many multiyear and multitranche operations have had implementation difficulties, in part \nbecause  ambitious,  multiyear  reform  agendas  were  in  excess  of  the  institutional  capacity  and \npolitical economy of the country. For example, the adjustment lending experience of the World \nBank indicates that during 1990-1999, 39% of two-tranche operations and 63% of three-tranche \noperations had waivers or cancellations.13 ADB experience has been similar. As a result, as an \nalternative,  the  World  Bank  has  now  moved  increasingly  to  a  series  of  single-tranche \noperations, with a well-defined, medium-term (programmatic) framework specified at the outset, \nincluding completed up-front reform actions and triggers for subsequent operations. The DPLs \nfit into this mold.  \n \n28. \nFor  effective  development  results,  the  policy  agenda  needs  to  be  backed  by  broader \npublic  sector  reforms  that  aim  to  address  thematic  and  cross-cutting  issues  of  governance, \npublic financial management, procurement, and accountability. At the same time, given the lack \nof  responsiveness  of  the  private  sector  to  mere  adoption  of  policies  and  passage of  laws,  the \ndevelopment  debate  advocates  emphasis  on  institutional  development,  capacity  building, \nimplementation of laws and policies, and improvements in procedures and systems. \n \n29. \nare imperative when designing adjustment lending: \n \n\nIn light of this evidence, evaluation studies increasingly advocate that the following steps \n\nAssess carefully the environment in which the reform agenda is planned, as well \nas  the  degree  of  country  commitment,  ownership,  and  readiness  shown  by  the \nGovernment. \nEnsure  that  the  development  agenda  encompasses  longer  term  economic, \nsocial, and institutional issues; and includes the flexibility to cope with emerging \nchanges and institutional problems. \nPromote broader stakeholder participation to obtain adequate buy-in and mitigate \nvested interests. \nEnsure  that  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  stability  measures  adequately  reinforce, \nfinancial \nand  are  supported  by,  a  proper  environment \nmanagement, and governance.  \nUse  adjustment  lending  as  a  flexible  development  instrument  to  nurture  an \neffective  development  partnership  that  evolves  in  tandem  with  the  country\u2019s \nbroader  development  agendas  and  to  build  consensus  among  development \npartners on policy advice.  \n\ninvestment, \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n30. \nThe DPSP is (i) to achieve and sustain higher economic growth through improved fiscal \nmanagement  and  investment  climate,  and  (ii)  to  reduce  poverty  and  unemployment  by \n\n                                                 \n13  World  Bank.  2001.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform  Program. \nManila (1965-INO). \n  \n \n \n33. \nThe DPSP recognizes Indonesia\u2019s positive track record of macroeconomic management, \noverall stability and fiscal consolidation after the 1997 financial crisis, leading to its exit from the \nIMF-supported program in 2003. However, some fundamental changes in Government strategy \nand  policy  to  enhance  the  quality  of  fiscal  management  are  needed.  Areas  of  critical \nsignificance  targeted  under  the  DPSP  include  (i)  reducing  distortionary  fuel  subsidies,  (ii) \nreorienting public spending to support poverty reduction programs, (iii) introducing tax reforms, \n(iv)  improving  debt  management,  and  (v)  streamlining  intergovernmental  borrowing.  A \ndescription of specific policy measures and actions under these areas follows. \n \n34. \nReduction in Subsidies to the Non-Poor. The fuel subsidy program has entailed high \nfiscal and economic costs, which compounded in 2005 with oil prices spiraling to unprecedented \nlevels.  Fuel  prices  for  most  products  have  been  below  international  levels,  with  gasoline  and \nkerosene  at  about  45%  and  12%  of  international  prices,  respectively.  As  fuel  subsidies  were \nregressive,  largely  benefiting  the  middle-class  and  curtailing  resources  for  productive  uses, \nincluding poverty reduction, the DPSP supports their reduction from the original budgeted level \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nof about $13 billion to $9 billion for 2005. Following three rounds of fuel price increases in 2005, \nthe  Government  has  cumulatively  raised  fuel  prices  by  165%,  an  unprecedented  magnitude \nsince a 12% increase in 2000, followed by a 30% increase in 2001.16  \n \n35. \nnon-poor: \n \n\nIn  2005,  the  Government  adopted  the  following  measures  to  reduce  subsidies  to  the \n\nall oil products: prices increased on average by 29% in March 2005; \n\n(i) \n(ii)  mining-based industries: prices were brought closer to international parity in July \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n2005; \nall industrial users with an average monthly fuel consumption of 500,000 liters or \nmore: prices were brought closer to international parity in August 2005; and \ngasoline,  automotive  diesel,  and  kerosene  for  individual  consumption:  prices \nincreased on average by 126.6% in October 2005. \n\n \n36. \nImpact of Subsidy Reduction. The reduction in fuel subsidies will have clear medium- \nto long-term benefits. In the immediate short term, however, it will affect growth through higher \ninflation and interest rates. While the first round of subsidy reduction in March 2005 did not lead \nto a significant overall increase in inflation, the October increase in fuel prices has led to a sharp \nincrease  in  inflation  of  18%  year-on-year.  In  the  short  term,  growth  may  be  affected  by  Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s move to raise interest rates by 225 basis points to 12.25% in November, a measure \nthat  will  slow  credit  growth.  Nonetheless,  the  reduction  in  fuel  subsidy  has  helped  contain  the \nplanned fiscal deficit for 2005 at Rp48.3 trillion, or minus 0.9% of GDP, close to the target, while \nproviding a window for improving the quality of fiscal management. Incorporating the impact of \nsubsidy reduction and tax reforms, the fiscal deficit for 2006 is forecast to be 0.7% of GDP.  \n \n37. \nReorienting  Public  Expenditures.  Fiscal  consolidation  pressures,  coupled  with \nmounting  fuel  subsidies,  have  squeezed  public  expenditure  growth.  Recognizing  the  adverse \nconsequences of reduced public spending, under the DPSP the Government has reoriented the \nfuel  subsidy  savings  to  priority  social  sector  and  poverty  reduction  programs.  Consistent  with \nthese goals, the Government has raised the resource allocations in various areas of the 2006 \nbudget over 2005 budget allocations: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ndevelopment and social spending increased from 3.2% to 3.7% of GDP; \ntransfers  to  the  regions  through  block  grants  increased  from  3.3%  to  4.8%  of \nGDP (or Rp153.8 trillion); and \ndoubling of regional special purpose grants from Rp4.8 trillion to Rp11.6 trillion.  \n\n \n38. \nBesides allowing for growth in public expenditures in the social sectors, in March 2005 \nthe  Government  began  financing  the  Compensation  Program  for  Reduction  in  Fuel  Subsidies \n(PKPS) to partly mitigate the social and political consequences of the sharp rise in fuel prices, \nand to create jobs and boost growth. The PKPS includes the following: \n\nUnconditional  cash  transfers  were  made  to  15.5  million  poor  households, \namounting to $10 per household/month (payments made quarterly, with the first \nin  October  2005).  The  full  cost  of  the  package  is  Rp18  trillion  ($1.8  billion),  of \nwhich  budget  spending  in  2005  is  close  to  Rp5  trillion.  The  transfers  are \nchanneled  to  households  with  authorized  identification  cards  through  local \nbranches of the post office and Bank Rakyat Indonesia.  \n\n                                                 \n16  A  subsequent  increase  of  22%  in  January  2003  was  partly  rolled  back  by  the  Government  of  former  President \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nMegawati Sukarnoputri. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOperational aid to schools (Rp6.3 trillion in 2005) to support the rehabilitation of \ndilapidated school buildings and augments recurrent expenditures. \n\nBasic  health  care  and  health  insurance  (Rp3.9  trillion  in  2005)  to  finance \nupgrading of health care facilities and insurance schemes for the poor. \n\nUpgrading  of  village  infrastructure  (Rp3.3  trillion  in  2005)  to  support  priority \ninfrastructure development in 12,800 villages in 427 districts (covering 20% of all \nvillages  and  45%  of  all  poor  villages).  Each  village  receives  a  block  grant  of \nRp250  million  ($25,000)  to  finance  roads,  irrigation  schemes,  water  supply  and \nsanitation,  and  small  fish-landing  facilities.  The  village  infrastructure  scheme  is \nmanaged and implemented by local communities. \n\n \nImpact  of  Public  Expenditure  Reorientation.  As  of  15  November  2005,  the \n39. \nGovernment  had  distributed  Rp3.7  trillion  ($370  million)  in  first  quarter  cash  compensation \ntransfers  to  13.3  million  households.17  Disbursements  have  started  under  the  other  schemes. \nThe  village  infrastructure  scheme,  in  particular,  will  have  a  significant  multiplier  effect  on  the \nlocal communities as the workers will be from the local communities and procurement needs will \nlikely  be  sourced  locally.  To  support  the  implementation  of  the  village  infrastructure  scheme, \naimed  at  poverty  reduction,  the  Government  and  ADB  have  designed  the  Rural  Infrastructure \nSupport Project.18\n \n40. \nTax  Reforms.  As  a  part  of  the  DPSP  process,  the  Government  has  modernized  tax \nadministration, and over the course of 2003\u20132005 formulated a far-reaching tax policy package, \nwhich  was  finalized  and  submitted  to  Parliament  in  October  2005.  This  package,  involving \nextensive  consultations  with  stakeholders,  entails  amendments  to  three  primary  laws:  Income \nTax  Law  17/2000,  the  Value-Added  Tax  Law  18/2000,  and  General  Tax  Administration  Law \n16/2000.  The  tax  policy  package  broadens  the  tax  base  and  restructures  tax  brackets,  while \nlowering rates to encourage investment and increase compliance. The measures taken by the \nGovernment under the DPSP include: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nTax  administration  reforms  focused  on  (a)  expansion  and  modernization  of  key \ntax offices, including building and computer infrastructure upgrading in tax offices \nin  Jakarta,  reorganization  of  staff  by  function  and  increase  of  remuneration, \nappointment  of  special  account  representatives,  and  institutionalization  of  the \ntax-payer bill of rights and the code of conduct for tax officials in the modernized \noffices, (b) additional tax payers registered and in December 2004 the first pilot \nsmall  taxpayer  office  established,  patterned  after  the  highly  successful  Large \nTaxpayers Office experiment introduced in 2003, and (c) electronic registration of \ntaxpayers and electronic filing of returns, introduced in January 2005. \n\nIncome tax changes comprising (a) introduction of a single corporate income tax \nrate,  to  be set  at  30%,  and  gradually  reduced to  25%  by 2010,  (b)  reduction  of \nthe maximum income tax rate for individuals gradually from 35% to 25% by 2010, \n(c)  increase  in  the  income  tax  bracket  from  Rp2.9  million  to  Rp10  million  to \nbenefit  low-income  earners,  and  (d)  reduction  in  tax  on  dividends  from  35%  to \n15% by 2010 to encourage investment. \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2005.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic Indonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support Project (draft).

The tax reform measures are not revenue neutral; independent \nestimates suggest they could result in a tax revenue loss of up to 0.5% of GDP. However, the \nGovernment  expects  to  offset  this  potential  loss  in  revenue  through  better  compliance  and \ntightening  of  tax  administration.  Tax  receipts  to  date  in  2005  are  considerably  above  2004 \nlevels; non-oil taxes to the end of August 2005 increased by 26%. Revenue gains are likely to \nemerge more fully next year with full expansion in the tax base and better registration. Owing to \nmeasures  adopted  by  the  Government,  the  number  of  taxpayers  has  steadily  increased,  from \n1.98 million in 2000 to 3.67 million at the end of 2004, and to 10 million as of October 2005. \n \n42. \nThe  public  perception  of  the  tax  system  is  improving.  An  independent  survey  in \nSeptember 2005 by the Large Taxpayers Office found that 81% of taxpayers were satisfied with \noverall services; 84% found tax filing easier, and 78% reported they have seen positive changes \nin  tax  officer  behavior.19  The  revisions  to  the  Tax  Administration  Law,  however,  have  been \ncontroversial.  The  business  community  has  expressed  serious  concerns  on  increased  powers \nbeing given to tax authorities, including the possible use of criminal sanctions against taxpayers.  \n \n43. \nImproving  Debt  Management.  Under  the  DPSP,  the  Government  has  adopted  and \nsubmitted  to  Parliament  the  decree  on  State  Debt  Management  Strategy  2005\u20132009  (MOF \ndecree 06/2005). The decree \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nmandates  the  Government  to  adopt  a  cost-effective  and  prudent  approach  to \ndebt  management \nthrough  adequate  diversification  and  hedging  against \ncurrency, maturity, interest rate, and investor and creditor risks; \nsets  out  broad  directions  for  decision-making  on  borrowing  and  debt  buy-back; \nand \nprovides  guidelines  on  transparency  and  public  accountability  of  debt  policy \nmanagement,  and  outlines  measures  to  strengthen  the  professionalism  and \n\n                                                 \n19  AC  Nielson  conducted  the  survey.  While  cross-country  comparisons  are  not  straightforward,  similar  surveys \nconducted  by  the  same  company  in  other  countries  indicate  the  overall  satisfaction  in  Indonesia  to  be  relatively \nhigher,  with  Australia  and  Hong  Kong,  China  scoring  70%;  Singapore  76%;  and  India  78%.  The  survey  in \nIndonesia covered (i) advice and counseling, (ii) filing and payment, (iii) tax audit and reviews, (iv) audit follow-up \nand collection, (v) objection management, (vi) refund system, and (vii) overall complaint resolution. Survey findings \nshow need for improvement in objection management (41% satisfaction rating) and audit follow-up and collection \n(63% satisfaction rating).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nperformance of the state debt management institutions within MOF that oversee \nexternal loans and the Government\u2019s treasury instruments.   \n\nThe  Government  also  has  formulated  a  coherent  strategy  for  managing  its  portfolio  of \n\n \n44. \ntreasury instruments, focused on \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nbalancing the maturity structure and lengthening the average maturity;  \nreducing  refinancing  risk,  mainly  during  2005/09  given  the  current  maturity \nprofile; \ndeveloping  and  enhancing  liquidity  in  the  secondary  market  to  shift  the \nGovernment bond yield curve downward and reduce refinancing costs; and  \n\n(iv)  maintaining  a  prudent  stock  of  domestic  debt  by  periodically  conducting  buy-\n\nbacks in the secondary market. \n\n \n45. \nImplementation of this strategic framework is well under way. The Government, with IMF \ntechnical  support,  has  adopted  a  framework  to  assess  external  debt  sustainability.  The \nGovernment has in place a system for publishing consolidated debt reports containing data on \nexternal and domestic debt\u2014with the latest one available for the second quarter of 2005.20  \n \n46. \nImpact of Improved Debt Management. The Government\u2019s debt management strategy \nis yielding results. Overall public debt has fallen from 91% of GDP in 2000 to 59% in 2003, and \nto 52% by June 2005. During 2000\u20132005, the outstanding domestic debt declined from 47% of \nGDP  to  25%,  and  external  debt  from  44%  to  27%.  Public  sector  debt  has  been  reprofiled, \neffectively  resulting  in  the  amount  of  commercial  debt  being  managed  comprising  2\u20133%  of \noverall external debt. Maturities have been lengthened with average time to maturity increasing \nfrom  5.9  years  in  2000  to  7.4  years  in  June  2005.  Sound  fiscal  and  macroeconomic \nmanagement has allowed Indonesia to expand its access to domestic, and reenter international, \ndebt markets. However, while debt-service costs have declined to 6% of GDP, they still account \nfor  53%  of  the  non-oil  revenues  and  42%  of  primary  spending.  Given  the  relatively  high  debt-\nservice burden and the exchange rate and interest rate vulnerabilities, Indonesia has committed \nto gradually reducing its debt level. The Government\u2019s medium-term target is to reduce its public \ndebt to 30% of GDP by 2010, although debt-threshold assessments indicate a debt level in the \nrange  of  35\u201342%  of  GDP  would  be  appropriate  (Appendix  6).  The  Government's  approach  to \ngradual  debt  reduction  will  release  additional  resources  for  public  expenditure  and  poverty \nreduction programs. In quantitative terms, the Government's current strategy would reduce the \ndebt stock by about $11 billion\u2013$16 billion annually through 2006\u20132010, which could provide a \nsignificant expenditure cushion. \n  \n47. \nStreamlining  Intergovernmental  Transfers.  Complementing  decentralization  reforms \nsupported  by  ADB,21  the  Government  is  taking  additional  steps  to  streamline  onlending  and \nongranting  mechanisms  for  regional  governments  under  the  DPSP.  Based  on  policy  dialogue \nand  extensive  interministerial  consultations,  the  regulatory  framework  being  adopted  by  the \nGovernment will set out the following provisions and procedures: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nonlending to be permissible for revenue-generating projects, while ongranting will \nbe  determined  on  a  selective  basis  to  support  key  social  service  delivery \ninitiatives; \nresolution of outstanding loan arrears;  \n\n                                                 \n20  The  latest  report  published  is  for  second  quarter  2005.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Sector Development Program. \nManila.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nstreamlined  project  and  program  selection  mechanism  through  the  issuance  of \nan  annual  list  of  projects  backed  by  a  rolling  5-year  catalogue,  by  BAPPENAS, \nthese  will  become  the  standard  documents  outlining  development  expenditure \npriorities, and form the basis for budget formulation; \nclear  plan  to  formulate  standard  operating  procedures  within  2006  for  project \nsubmission  and  appraisal,  and  reporting  all  relevant  details  in  the  annual  list  of \nprojects  and  the  5-year  catalogue  to  ensure  transparent  access  to  all  regional \ngovernments;  \nstreamlined  project  approval  mechanism  by  dismantling  the  interministerial \nassessment  team  reviewing  subnational  borrowing  and  establishing  a  single \nwindow  in  MOF  (onlending  directorate)  to  authorize  borrowing  against  a  simple \ncheck list, subject to the project being included in the annual list of projects; and \ngradually  expanding  specific  grants,  and  transferring  more  resources  through \nspecific grants from centrally sponsored financing arrangements. \n\n \n48. \nThree Government regulations defining these issues are now complete, and have been \nchecked for consistency, approved by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, and submitted for \nthe President\u2019s endorsement. As part of the DPSP, MOF has drafted an implementation decree \non onlending, setting out the business process for streamlined institutional arrangements. This \ndecree  will  be  endorsed  by  the  minister  of  finance  upon  Presidential  endorsement  of  the \nregulatory framework.  \n \n49. \nImpact  of  Streamlining  Intergovernmental  Transfers.  The  new  measures,  to  be \neffective from 2006, will lead to qualitative changes in the planning and budgeting process: (i) \nsector  ministries  and  regional  governments  will  have  up-front  clarity  on  the  Government\u2019s \npriorities  for  local  government  projects  and  their  sources  of  financing;  (ii)  assessment  and \napproval  process  for  onlending  will  be  simpler  and  shorter,  subject  to  compliance  with  project \nreadiness  and  financial  soundness  criteria;  and  (iii)  public  service  delivery  will  be  improved  at \nthe decentralized levels, through a more systematic project approval process.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving the Investment Climate \n\n \nStrengthening  Legal,  Regulatory,  and  Institutional  Framework  for  Investments.22 \n50. \nAs  part  of  the  DPSP,  specific  measures  taken  by  the  Government  to  strengthen  investment \nenvironment include \n \n\n(i) \n\ndrafting  and  finalizing  a  new  investment  law23  that  (a)  creates  a  unified  national \nframework law covering all investments, (b) states the principle of equal treatment \nof  all  investors,  (c)  streamlines  the  entry  of  new  investors  by  moving  from  an \napproval-oriented  system  to  a  simple  registration  framework,  (d)  simplifies  the \nregistration  process  to  reduce  the  time  required,  (e)  stipulates  a  negative  list  of \ninvestments  that  is  short  and  clear,  (f)  reaffirms  free  repatriation  of  capital,  (g) \nallows for the use of dispute resolution mechanisms, (h) reaffirms the principle of \nno expropriation without compensation, (i) permits the use of foreign expertise, (j) \nprovides  a  foundation  for  investment  promotion  and  facilitation,  (k)  removes  the \n\n                                                 \n22 In addition, the World Bank\u2019s DPL-2 Board document also cross-refers to an ADB-supported condition relating to \nstreamlining  of  regional  taxation  by  amending  the  Law  on  Regional  Taxes  and  Charges,  under  an  ongoing  ADB \nProgram (footnote 21). \n\n23  Previous  efforts  to  introduce  a  new  law  (including  under  ADB\u2019s  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  SME  loan)  were \nconstrained  by  lack  of  consensus  within  the  Government,  inadequate  coordination,  and  the  political  transition  in \n2003\u20132004  (ADB.  1999.

The \nGovernment remains committed to resolve several other high-profile disputes. \n\ninvestment  disputes; \n\nInfrastructure Reforms. The reform measures introduced under the DPSP in this area \n\nin \n\n(PPP) \n\nEnhance  institutional  coordination  to  promote  private  sector  participation  (PSP) \nand  public-private  partnerships \ninfrastructure  development  by \nstrengthening  KKPPI.  A  new  Presidential  decree  (No.  42/2005)  adopted  under \nthe DPSP will strengthen the role and authority of KKPPI.24 It will help ensure a \nconsistent approach to PSP across the infrastructure sectors and efficient use of \npublic  and  private  funds  by  sector  ministries  and  local  governments.  The  new \nDecree  will  help  KKPPI  to  be  more  effective  in  (a)  formulating  strategies  and \npolicies  to  accelerate  infrastructure  development  through  the  public  and  private \nsectors, (b) coordinating and supervising the implementation of these strategies \nand  policies  by  the  sector  ministries  and  local  governments,  (c)  formulating  an \nimplementation  policy  on  public  service  obligation  for  infrastructure,  and  (d) \nresolving problems that impede infrastructure development. KKPPI will have two \nsecretariats25 to effectively coordinate between key sector ministries in PSP and \nPPP projects. \n\nStrengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  PSP  through  replacing  the  earlier \nPresidential decree (No. 7/1998) by a Presidential regulation (No. 67/2005). The \nnew Regulation facilitates PSP by (a) defining two forms of PSP: partnerships or \nlicensing  agreements,  (b)  stipulating  the  rules  and  procedures  for  selecting \nprivate  sponsors  through  open  and  transparent  bidding,  and  (c)  outlining  an \napproach  for  dispute  resolution.  PPP  projects  can  be  identified  and  prepared \neither  by  the  Government  or  the  private  sector,  but  the  sponsors  have  to  be \nselected  on  a  competitive  basis.  The  Decree  outlines  the  rules  and  procedures \nfor the bidding process. Tariffs should be set for full cost recovery. If this exceeds \ncustomer\u2019s  affordability  to  pay,  the  difference  is  to  be  compensated  by  a  public \nservice obligation subsidy from the Government. Risks should be allocated to the \nparty that is best able to manage and control them. \n\nEstablish  a  risk  management  committee  on  infrastructure  provision  in  MOF \n(through  decree  No.  518/KMK.01/2005)  to  (a)  develop  a  risk  management \nframework  to  assess,  price,  monitor,  and  manage  the  contingent  liabilities  that \narise  from  selective  guarantees  for  PPP  projects,  (b)  link  the  framework  to  the \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n24  KKPPI, which reports directly to the President, is cochaired by the coordinating minister of economic affairs and the \nstate  minister  of  national  development  planning/chairperson  of  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS), the latter acting as the executive chair. Its members include the ministers of finance, home affairs, \nenergy  and  mineral  resources,  public  works,  transportation,  communications  and  informatics,  and  state-owned \nenterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary. \n\n25  Headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for  infrastructure  and  regional  development  in  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of \n\nEconomic Affairs and the deputy minister for infrastructure in BAPPENAS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nexisting budgeting, fiscal accounting, and debt management systems; (c) ensure \na proper alignment of risks in individual PPP projects between public and private \nsectors,  and  (d)  effectively  manage  the  Government\u2019s  overall  exposure  in  PPP \nprojects. The committee will perform the actual risk management functions until a \nfor \nformal  permanent  unit \nthe \nGovernment  support \nperformance  targets  for  partnership  and  licensing  agreements,  and  monitoring \nperformance of PPP projects during their operation. \n\nincluding  examining  requests \nfor  PPP  projects  approved  by  KKPPI,  setting \n\nis  established, \n\n \nImpact of Infrastructure Reforms. With the measures taken under the DPSP, the legal \n52. \nand institutional frameworks for PSP and risk management are in place. The Government has \nthus  fulfilled  its  commitment  made  at  the  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Summit  in  January  2005  to \nprovide  a  predictable  environment,  level  playing  field,  and  risk-sharing  arrangements.  The \nchallenge now is to fully operationalize these new frameworks and institutions. The latter need \nextensive capacity building to fulfill their mandate.26  \n \n53. \nProgress  with  project  transactions  has  so  far  not  met  expectations.  Of  the  91  projects \noffered  to  private  investors  at  the  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Summit,  only  four  water  supply \nprojects are under construction, and contracts have been awarded for four toll roads. Apart from \nthat, prequalification and bidding are underway for 13 toll roads, seven power plants, three gas \npipelines, six water supply projects, one port, two airports, one ferry terminal, and one railway. \nThe  main  reasons  for  not  having  achieved  more  contract  awards  and  financial  closings  are \ninadequate project preparation, lack of central coordination, and the uncertainties still faced by \ninvestors.  With  the  recent  completion  of  the  PSP  and  risk  management  frameworks  that \naddress  these  problems,  the  execution  of  PPP  projects  is  expected  to  accelerate.  Another \nimportant boost for infrastructure development will come from the recent sharp reduction of fuel \nsubsidies, which not only frees large resources for public investments in rural infrastructure and \nother  noncommercial  projects,  but also  provides  a  favorable  environment  for  PSP  in  domestic \ngas market development by removing distortions in fuel prices. \n \n54. \nAdopting a Medium-Term Action Plan for SME Development. The Government aims \nto  provide  a  stable  policy  and  regulatory  environment  for  SME  development  to  promote \neconomic growth, employment, and poverty reduction. As part of the DPSP, in February 2005 \nthe  Ministry  of  Cooperatives  and  SMEs  adopted  the  SME  Empowerment  Action  Program  for \n2005\u20132009  to  facilitate  the  establishment  of  new  SMEs  and  cooperatives  through  adequate \nstart-up services and incentives, and strengthen the provision of business development services \nthrough formation of SME clusters. In addition, the Government has made an initial allocation of \nRp0.42  trillion  ($42  million)  from  the  PKPS  to  be  channeled  through  savings  and  loan \ncooperatives in over 5,000 villages to help stimulate micro and small enterprises. \n \n55. \nImpact  of  Medium-Term  Action  Plan  for  SME  Development.  The  Government  has \nkeenly focused on job creation. Through the new action program, about 6 million new micro and \nsmall  enterprises  are  expected  to  be  created  by  2009,  up  from  the  40  million  estimated \nregistered  and  unregistered  enterprises  operating  at  present.  Employment  in  microenterprises \nand SMEs has grown at an average annual rate of 3.1% since 2000. The Government\u2019s action \nprogram, supported under the DPSP, envisages creating about 15 million new jobs, to support \nits aim of halving open unemployment from 9.9% in 2004 to 5.1% in 2009. The action program \nwill also help strengthen the network of 70,000 cooperatives serving over 20 million members.   \n\n                                                 \n26 ADB will provide capacity building for the BAPPENAS part of the KKPPI secretariat through a proposed technical \nassistance for $2 million (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic Indonesia on Support for Infrastructure \nDevelopment (draft). Manila). The World Bank has been supporting the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs \npart  of  the  KKPPI  secretariat  and  the  sector  ministries  through  its  $17.3  million  loan  for  the  Private  Provision  of \nInfrastructure Technical Assistance. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\n3. \n\nDeveloping and Strengthening Financial System \n\nAlthough \n\nIndonesia\u2019s \n\nfinancial  system  has \n\n \n56. \nrecovered  and  been  substantially \nconsolidated,  the  sector  faces  lingering  fragilities  in  the  wake  of  structural  weaknesses  and \nvulnerabilities. Under the DPSP, the Government, with technical and advisory support of ADB, \nWorld  Bank,  IMF,  and  other  development  partners,  has  managed  to  develop  a  strategy  and \ninstitutional  mechanism  for  a  financial  safety  net  (FSN),  strengthened  the  prudential  and \nregulatory framework for banks, and taken steps to promote product and industry diversification, \nprincipally through NBFIs.  \n \n57. \nDevelopment of the FSN. To provide greater financial stability and restore public sector \nconfidence  in  the  banking  system,  the  Government  announced  a  three-pillar  FSN  system \nincluding  a  formal  deposit  insurance  scheme,  a  lender  of  last  resort  facility,  and  a  bank \nresolution  framework.  Specific  measures  include  the  enactment  of  the  Law  on  Deposit \nInsurance  in  June  2004,  which  prepared  for  the  establishment  of  the  Deposit  Insurance \nCompany  (LPS)  in  October  2005.27  Replacing  the  blanket  guarantee,  which  was  fully  phased \nout in September 2005,28  LPS will (i) provide full insurance coverage to all eligible deposits in \nthe first 6 months (until March 2006), (ii) lower this coverage to deposits up to Rp5 billion over \nthe next 6 months (until September 2006), and (iii) lower the coverage to Rp1 billion after 1 year \n(until March 2007). LPS will cover only deposits up to Rp100 million from March 2007 onward. \nConcurrently,  Bank  Indonesia  set  up  the  Lender  of  Last  Resort  Facility  to  provide  short-term \nliquidity support and emergency liquidity support to solvent banks in case of any systemic risks \nto the system. The Financial Stability Forum\u2014a joint initiative being developed by MOF, Bank \nIndonesia, and LPS\u2014will deliberate on the role, functions, and institutional arrangements for a \nbank resolution system. \n \n58. \nEnhancing  Financial  Stability.  With  over  130  banks  in  the  system  and  the  relatively \nhigh  asset  concentration  in  the  top  20  banks,  Bank  Indonesia  issued  a  new  plan\u2014the \nIndonesian  Banking  Architecture\u2014in  2004  with  a  range  of  measures  to  strengthen  the \nprudential  and  risk  management  framework  of  the  banking  system,  improve  asset  quality  of \nbanks, and enhance public and consumer confidence. Bank Indonesia plans to implement these \nmeasures  during  2004\u20132009.  In  parallel,  Bank  Indonesia  initiated  measures  to  gradually \nimplement  the  new  supervisory  framework  set  out  by  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking \nSupervision  during  2007\u20132011,  with  advance  actions  taken  during  2005\u20132006.  During  the \ncourse of the DPSP, the specific measures by Bank Indonesia include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nintroduction of the Regulation on Minimum Capital Requirements (7/15/PBI/2005) \nin July 2005 requiring all banks to comply with a tier 1 capital requirement of no \nless than Rp80 billion ($8 million) by 31 December 2007 and no less than Rp100 \nbillion ($10 million) by 31 December 2010; \nissuance of Payment System Regulation 7/22/2005 to strengthen the provision of \nintraday  liquidity  support  to  commercial  banks;  the  new  facility  will  reduce  the \nburden on the real time gross settlement system by providing interim support as \nthe clearance process takes place through this system; \ndrafting  of  a  regulation  on  good  corporate  governance  (with  adoption  by  Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s  Board  envisaged  in  early  2006),  stipulating  fitness  criteria  for \nmanagement,  code  of  conduct  for  the  board  of  directors  and  board  of \ncommissioners, and requirements for the auditing committee and other standards \nin line with the Basel Committee Guidelines on good corporate governance and \n\n                                                 \n27  LPS will have a capitalization of Rp4 trillion. \n28  In April 2005, the Government started limiting the blanket guarantee only to saving deposits and interbank loans, \n\nand finally by September 2005 the coverage for interbank loans was removed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthe  revised  good  corporate  governance  principles  of  the  Organization  for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development; \nadoption  of  the  Regulation  for  Risk  Management  Certification  7/25/PBI/2005 \nstipulating competency requirements for all bank managers and members of the \nboard of commissioners dealing with risk management; \nadoption of the Regulation on Asset Securitization 7/4/2005 to facilitate effective \ncredit  risk  and  liquidity  management  by  commercial  banks;  the  regulation  sets \nout  the  principle,  criteria,  and  mechanism  for  asset  securitization,  which  will  in \nturn help portfolio management as well as product diversification in the broader \nfinancial sector;  \nestablishment  of  a  Credit  Information  Bureau  (regulation  7/8/2005)  in  August \n2005, to upgrade Bank Indonesia\u2019s in-house credit information system; the new \nbureau  has \ninformation  system,  with  complete  and \ncomprehensive debtor profiles, starting with negative information; and \nadoption of consumer protection measures to (a) enhance transparency in bank \nproduct  information  and  use  of  personal  customer  data  by  banks    (through \nregulation 7/6/PBI/2005), and (b) stipulate mechanisms for resolution of customer \ncomplaints,  and  for  subsequent  monitoring  to  ensure  that  follow-up  remedial \nactions are implemented (through regulation 7/7/PBI/2005). \n\nin  place  a  debtor \n\n \nImpact  of  FSN  and  Enhanced  Financial  Stability.  The  immediate  impact  of  some  of   \n\n59. \nthese measures may be muted due to the prevailing high interest rate environment, which has \ncut  the  interest  margins  and  profitability  of  banks  since  December  2004.  However,  the  timely \nestablishment  of  LPS  and  gradual  phase-out  of  the  blanket  guarantee  have  proceeded \nsmoothly.  The  FSN  and  regulatory  measures  taken  under  the  DPSP  will  help  strengthen  risk \nmanagement and asset quality during 2006\u20132007.  \n \n60. \nUndertake  Measures  to  Strengthen  NBFIs.  As  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  under  the \nDPSP, the Government has taken several actions in its first year aimed at strengthening capital \nmarket  regulation,  especially  in  the  area  of  mutual  funds  (disclosure  and  transparency  of \nprospectus, advertisements, accounting practices, and adoption of market-to-market principle in \nnet  asset  value  calculation).  However,  the  mutual  fund  industry  continues  to  face  serious \nproblems  of  rapid  redemptions.  ADB  has  been  closely  involved  in  developing  the  regulatory \nframework  for  pensions  and  insurance.  In  2005,  as  part  of  the  DPSP,  the  Government  has \ntaken  steps  to  strengthen  the  industry:  all  operators  of  pension  funds  are  now  required  to  be \ncertified;  and  MOF  has  continued  strict  regulatory  measures  against  several  small  insolvent \ninsurance companies.  \n \n61.  With  regard  to  capital  markets,  a  development  master  plan  is  in  place.  In  December \n2004, the Government adopted the Non-Bank Financial Sector Action Plan as part of the ADB-\nsupported Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program.29 Implementation of the \naction plan is under way, with good progress made in some areas, including regulatory actions \nin  the  insurance  sector  and  harmonization  between  Bank  Indonesia  and  MOF.  Facilitated \nthrough  policy  dialogue  under  the  DPSP,  a  Presidential  decree  (no.63/2005)  was  signed  in \nOctober 2005, to merge the Directorate General of Financial Institutions in MOF which oversees \npension,  insurance  and  finance  companies  with  the  Capital  Market  Supervision  Agency.  The \nGovernment  has  committed  to  strengthen  the  merged  institution  during  the  course  of  2006. \nThese  outcomes  would  ensure  continuity  of  reforms  initiated  in  2000-2002  with  ADB  support, \naimed at consolidating financial sector supervision and facilitating regulatory harmonization. \n \n\n                                                 \n29  ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\n62. \nImpact  of  Measures  to  Strengthen  NBFIs.  The  institutional  and  regulatory  reforms \nunder  the  DPSP  need  to  be  supplemented  by  market  and  product  development  in  the  NBFI \nsector.  The  high  demand  for  infrastructure  investments  is  expected  to  provide  investment \nopportunities,  catalyze  growth  of  fixed-income  instruments,  and  lead  to  the  development  of \nmore financing options over the course of 2005\u20132009.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImproving Public Financial Management and Strengthening Anticorruption \nInitiatives \n\n \n63. \nUnder the DPSP, the Government has achieved the following: \n\nStrengthen  Regulatory  Framework  to  Promote  Transparency  and  Accountability. \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\ncompleted  all  regulations  required  under  the  State  Finance  Law  (17/2003),  with \nthe recent adoption of regulations on Government accounting standards; \n\nadopted  6  of  the  12  implementing  regulations  required  for  the  State  Treasury \nLaw; of the remaining, the most critical, including the regulation on autonomous \nservice  agencies  (hospitals,  universities  and  other  service  institutions),  cash \nmanagement,  and \nfinancial  and  performance  reporting  (for  Government \nagencies),  have  been  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Human  Rights  for \nreview  and  final  submission  to  the  President  for  approval;  the  pending \nregulations  on  budget  execution  and  internal  controls  (across  the  entire \ngovernment) are being finalized; and  \n\nin  the  more  complex  area  of  audit,  involving  both  state  and  Parliamentary \ninstitutions, the drafting of the seven implementing regulations for the 2004 State \nAudit Law is under way.  \n\n64. \nConsolidated Government Cash Management. As part of the DPSP, the Government \nhas finalized a timetable and an implementation plan for the treasury single account (TSA) and \nthe consolidation of all central Government accounts.30 These form part of the overall Treasury \nwork plan, prepared with IMF support. In the work plan, the Government has fixed a timetable to \nextend the zero daily account balance pilot required to operationalize the TSA to all local state \ntreasury service offices (KPKN). The work plan also sets out a schedule for rationalizing bank \naccounts  currently  outside  the  control  of  the  Directorate  General  of  Treasury,  including  the  oil \nresources  transitory  account  and  accounts  under  the  regional  development  account  system, \nwhich deals with intergovernmental borrowing transactions. Effective consolidation of accounts \nbeyond  MOF  will  require  the  additional  legal  authority  of  the  cash  management  regulation, \nwhich will confer the authority to obtain information on all Government bank accounts and close \nthem  leading  to  consolidation.  In  addition,  the  Government  successfully  established  a  pilot  of \nthe zero balance bank account process at a KPKN in Jakarta in July 2005. MOF plans to extend \nthis pilot to two additional KPKNs from December 2005. \n \n65. \nStrengthen  Internal  Controls  to  Enhance  Transparency.  Under  the  DPSP,  the \nGovernment  operationalized  the  investigation  unit  within  the  Inspector  General  (IG)\u2019s  Office  in \nMOF,  and  vested  it  with  the  legal  powers  to  investigate  all  MOF  employees.  The  unit  has \nadequate authority and resources, based on an MOF decree; all its officials have gone through \na  polygraph  test  to  ensure  integrity.  The  minister  of  finance  has  approved  special  allowances \ndesigned to improve organizational incentives.  \n                                                 \n30  The  establishment  of  the  TSA  system  will  help  improve  the  Government\u2019s  cash  management,  in  particular  by \neventually  bringing  all  off-budget  accounts  inside  and  outside  of  MOF  into  a  single,  daily  zero-balance  account. \nThe  implementation  plan  and  timetable  adopted  provide  for  a  periodic  census  of  all  government  bank  accounts, \nand gradual transfer of the individual accounts into the TSA.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \nImpact  of  Improved  Financial  Management  and  Internal  Controls.  The  impact  of \n66. \nmeasures supported under the DPLs and DPSP should be seen in the broader context of the \nGovernment\u2019s own efforts to improve governance and combat corruption. More directly, the IG\u2019s \ninvestigation  unit  has  undertaken  39  investigations,  35  are  complete  with  28  findings  of  guilt \nleading  to  sanctions  against  67  people.  In  addition,  the  IG\u2019s  Office  has  memorandums  of \nunderstanding  with  the  Corruption  Eradication  Commission  (KPK)  and  tax  and  customs \nadministrations.  The  proposed  Tax  Law  amendments  have  clauses  that  strengthen  legal \ncertainty for the IG\u2019s Office.  \n \n67. \nAt  a  broader  level,  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  on  anticorruption  and  establishment  of \nthe  KPK  are  beginning  to  yield  results.  Recent  convictions  of  the  former  governor  of  the \nprovince of Aceh and members and staff of the General Election Commission are some of the \nkey  successes  of  the  KPK.  The  Government  has  also  pursued  scandals  in  Bank  Mandiri  and \nBank  Negara  Indonesia  in  a  vigilant  manner.  KPK  recently  launched  a  sting  operation  in  the \nSupreme Court to investigate the alleged payment of bribes of $1.6 million to judges and court \nofficials.  These  outcomes  are  bound  to  positively  influence  investments.  However,  significant \nnegative  perception  continues  among  investors,  given  the  general  legal  and  regulatory \nuncertainties and lack of good governance in major Government departments. This is clearly an \narea  where  the  Government  needs  to  pursue  reforms  in  a  vigorous  manner,  as  recognized  in \nthe development policy letter (Appendix 2). Appendix 7 presents the outcomes and challenges \nin the governance and anticorruption areas.  \n \nC. \n  \nThe development policy letter (Appendix 2) sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for \n68. \nthe  next  1\u20132  years  building  on  the  reform  momentum  of  the  DPSP.  The  forward-looking \nprogram includes the following commitments: \n \n\nForward Looking Program \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic and Creditworthiness  \n\n \n69. \nEstablishment of a Fiscal Policy Office. The office will be responsible for development \nof a medium-term fiscal framework and provide policy advice to the minister of finance and the \ntax,  budget,  and  treasury  functions  within  MOF.  The  office  will  have  a  sound  organizational \nstructure, terms of reference for individual positions, and budget to be fully operational in 2007. \nIts functions will include analysis of proposed tax, tariff, and financial market policies; improved \nquality and usefulness of information on corporate and individual taxpayers (with due attention \nto confidentiality sufficient for effective tax forecasting and policy analysis); and improved tariff-\nsetting processes. \n \n70. \nAssessment  of  Contingent  Liabilities.  To  implement  the  debt  management  strategy \nholistically,  the  Government  will  assess  implicit  and  explicit  contingent  liabilities,  such  as \npension liabilities and guarantees, monitor the overall debt by quantifying its costs and risks on \npublic  debt,  and  publish  periodic  integrated  (domestic  and  foreign)  debt  reports.  For  regional \ngovernment  debt,  the  Government  will  adopt  improved  procedures  for  the  loan  work-out \nprocedures and a framework for issuance of debt instruments, within the broader framework of \noverall debt management.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImprove the Investment Climate \n\n \n71. \nImprove Public Transparency and Enhance Financial Soundness. The Government \nwill  issue  a  new  law  on  the  regional  government  enterprises  which,  among  others,  will  define \ntheir legal status, their fiscal and financial relationship with regional governments (including the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\nto  Attract \n\nIntroduce  Proactive  Risk  Mitigation  Measures \n\ntreatment of continent liabilities relating to regional government enterprises in local government \nbudgets),  and  modalities  for  their  operational  and  financial  restructuring.  As  some  of  these \nenterprises  provide  essential  public  services,  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation,  a  separate \nlaw on their status will facilitate service provision as well as PSP.  \n \nStrengthen the Regulatory Framework to Attract Investments. The Government will \n72. \nissue implementing regulations to support the effective implementation of the Investment Law, \nwhich will, among others, involve creating a transparent negative list and shifting from a system \nof approvals to registration, requiring a reduction in business start-up time from 151 days to 30 \ndays by simplifying the company formation process, and revitalizing the National Team for the \nDevelopment of Exports and Investment.  \n \n73. \nInfrastructure \nInvestments. In the 2007 budget, MOF will provide for specific budgetary allocation for public \nsupport  to  PPP  transactions  in  infrastructure  including  both  cash  items  (i.e.,  supplemental \nsubsidies), and noncash items (i.e., guarantees and other forms of contingent liabilities) if any.   \n \nEnhance  Regional  Competitiveness.  The  Government  will  draft  a  trade  bill  that  will \n74. \naim  to  lay  out  a  framework  for  enhancing  domestic  and  international  competitiveness  and \nlaunch efforts to monitor progress in this area.  \n \n \n \n75. \nthe \nGovernment will continue implementing the FSN, including lowering the coverage of the deposit \nguarantee scheme to Rp1 billion by September 2006 as per the announced schedule. \n \n76. \nEnhance  Financial  Stability.  The  Government  and  Bank  Indonesia  will  finalize  the \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  bank  closing  and  emergency  operations  through  agreements \nbetween the relevant agencies, and establishment of a financial sector stability forum. \n \n77. \nPromote Product and Sector Diversification. The Government will finalize and adopt \nan  NBFI  strategy  to  diversify  the  financial  sector,  and  help  meet  long-term  needs  for \ninfrastructure financing.  \n \n\nImprove  Public  Confidence.  Through \n\nFinancial Sector Reforms \n\nInsurance  Company, \n\nthe  Deposit \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nPublic Financial Management and Anticorruption \n\nStreamline  Budget  Preparation  and  Disbursements.  The  introduction  of  the  new \n78. \nbudget  classification  and  disbursement  system  in  2005  has  led  to  serious  delays  in \ndevelopment financing. While the procedural problems have been corrected, a major underlying \nstructural weakness is in reporting of budget outturns from budget agencies to MOF in a timely \nmanner. The forward-looking program will institutionalize a quarterly reporting system on budget \nspending  by  line  agencies.  The  Government  will  also  aim  to  improve  the  quality  of  budgeting \nprocess  at  entry,  by  reviewing  program  structures  and  provide  improved  guidance  to  line \nagencies in moving to a functional medium-term expenditure framework, requiring draft budget \nrequirements to be submitted by the end of 2006 for preparing the 2008 budget. \n \n79. \nCash  Management  Account  Consolidation.  Building  on  progress  under  the  DPSP, \nMOF will gradually expand the coverage of all Government accounts under the TSA framework, \nwith the expectation of covering at least 75% of the treasury transactions \n \n80. \nTransparency  in  Reporting.  In  line  with  the  new  Government  accounting  standards, \nthe Government will improve the quality and timeliness of complete reporting on financial assets \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nand  liabilities  of  all  line  ministries,  and  establish  a  system  for  reconciling  reports  on  financial \ntransactions.  \n \n81. \nAnticorruption.  The  Government  will  focus  its  efforts  on  improving  the  public \nprocurement  process.  The  President  of  Indonesia  has  taken  an  active  interest  in  procurement \npolicy,  emphasizing  its  importance  in  ensuring  good  governance  and  anticorruption,  and  has \ndirected  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  to  establish  a  high-level  procurement \npolicy body that reports directly to him. In line with this, and building on progress made in public \nprocurement  through  the  adoption  of  the  Presidential  decree  on  procurement  in  2003,  the \nGovernment aims to set up a national procurement policy office that will consolidate the policy \nand regulatory functions in this area. In parallel, the Government will also develop an electronic \nprocurement system and disseminate procurement and bidding documents. \n \n\n5. \n\nPublic Service Delivery \n\n82. \nImprove  Poverty  Orientation  of  Public  Spending.  The  Government  (through \nBAPPENAS) will monitor the effectiveness and undertake independent operational assessment, \nincluding  the  fiduciary  aspects,  of  the  new  compensation  programs:  the  unconditional  cash \ntransfers  and  PKPS,  with  the  aim  of  improving  the  impact  of  public  expenditures  on  poverty \nreduction  and  achievement  of  MDGs,  and  ensuring  that  the  benefits  reach  the  intended \nbeneficiaries.  In  parallel,  the  Government  plans  to  enhance  and  modify  unconditional  cash \ntransfer schemes to develop more effective conditional cash transfer systems.31  \n \nD. \n \nThe  Government  and  the  development  partners  have  agreed  on  a  range  of  outcome \n83. \nindicators  to  monitor  DPSP  implementation  and  evaluate  its  impact,  within  the  overall  DPL \nframework (Table 3).   \n  \nTable 3: Medium-Term Outcome Indicators for the Development Policy Support Program \n \n\nMedium-Term Outcome Indicators for the DPSP \n\nMedium-Term Targets \n(by end-2007) \n\nBaseline Data \n(end-2003) \n\nCurrent Status \n(as of November 2005) \n\n(cid:131) Upgrade of credit rating to B+ \n\n(cid:131) Sovereign rating at B in 2003 \n\n(cid:131)  Standard & Poor\u2019s raised \n\nImproved Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness \n(cid:131) Continued budget deficit at or \n\n(cid:131) Budget deficit at 1.7% of GDP \n\nbelow 1.0% of GDP \n\nin 2003 \n\n(cid:131) Mobilize between 0.6% and \n0.9% of GDP in additional \nnon-oil and gas revenues \n\n(cid:131) Domestic non-oil and gas tax \nrevenues at 9.7% of GDP in \n2003 \n\nor equivalent \n\nImproved Investment Climate \n(cid:131) Increase in share of \n\ninvestment to GDP by 3\u20135% \n\n18.9% in 2003 \n\n(cid:131) Share of investment to GDP at \n\n(cid:131) Reduce the start-up time for \nnew businesses from 151 to \n30 days \n\n(cid:131) Start-up time for new business \n\n151 days \n\n(cid:131) Budget deficit projected at 0.8% \nof GDP in 2005; 2006 budget \nprojected to be below 1% \n(cid:131)  Domestic non-oil and gas \n\nrevenues remain at 9.7% of GDP \nin 2004; projected to increase to \n10.5% in 2005 \n\nsovereign rating from B to B+ \n\n(cid:131) Share of investment to GDP rose \nby 2% in 2004; projected to rise \nby 1.7% in 2005 \n\n(cid:131)  Start-up time for new business \n\n80 days. \n\n                                                 \n31  ADB\u2019s support has been sought for improving public service delivery in the social sectors through a new program \naimed at poverty reduction and MDG acceleration, proposed for 2006.

First,  Indonesia  with  its \n84. \nstrong  ownership  has  managed  to  coordinate  all  principal  development  partners  to  develop  a \nconsistent  and  well-sequenced  policy  framework  that  prepares  for  macroeconomic  and  cross-\ncutting  structural  reforms  over  the  medium  term.  The  package  subscribes  to  the  Paris \nharmonization  development  agenda.  This  has  been  achieved  by  aligning  the  development \npartners\u2019 strategies and approaches to the Government\u2019s development strategy for 2004\u20132009, \nwhich  takes  into  account  Indonesia\u2019s  emerging  status  as  a  middle-income  country.  This  has \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\ninvolved  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  aligning  and  harmonizing  their  respective  strategies  and \nmodalities. \n  \n85. \nSecond, the macroeconomic and cross-cutting policy framework is well coordinated with \nthe sector reform packages that broaden and deepen the DPSP. Examples of the sector reform \nprograms  are  the  ongoing  Local  Governance  and  Finance  Program  and  the  proposed \nInfrastructure Reform and Poverty and MDG acceleration programs, currently under discussion. \nConcurrent momentum on policy dialogue on these helps ensure continuity and sustainability of \nreforms. \n \n86. \nThird,  the  DPSP  has  helped  establish  an  institutional  mechanism  to  achieve  better \ninterministerial and interagency coordination to ensure proper coordination and implementation \nof reforms. An example of this is strengthening of institutional coordination between BAPPENAS \nand MOF to simplify and improve coordination of implementation of the decentralization policy \nframework,  as  well  as  approval  and  implementation  of  development  projects.  In  addition,  the \nDPSP  has  helped  define  roles,  functions,  and  responsibilities  in  approval,  financing,  and \nmonitoring of infrastructure development projects. \n \n87. \nFourth, the DPSP emphasizes qualitative changes in processes and programs to ensure \neffective implementation rather than a mere focus on conditionalities that do not often yield any \nclear results on the ground. \n \n88. \nThese elements and approaches have many advantages. They have drawn on collective \nadvice  and  analytical  work  of  all  the  partners.  They  have  provided  the  Government  with  the \nopportunity to steer its development program and process, keeping in perspective challenges of \nexecutive branch implementation and political capacity. The high ownership has already helped \ndevelopment of the future direction of reform and adjustments in areas where it was warranted. \nTogether this has provided for sustainability of reforms, while reducing the transaction costs for \nall parties. \n  \nF. \n \n89. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the DPSP. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options \nthat  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft program \nloan  agreement.  The  Government  has  made  its  own  independent  decision  to  borrow  under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  it  has  given  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  not \nmade on the basis of any advice from ADB. \n \n90. \nThe ADB funds support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter and policy \nmatrix (Appendix 2). The loan size was determined by the strengths of the policy package, its \ndevelopment impact, and the importance of the sectors covered.  \n \n91. \nDelays in development spending in 2005, due to changes in budgetary procedures, and \nthe reduction in fuel subsidies in March and October 2005, will provide fiscal space for greater \ndevelopment expenditures in 2006. However, the Government\u2019s gross financing needs remain  \nhigh  as  it  must  budget  for  (i)  increases  in  public  expenditure  for  poverty  reduction  programs, \nutilizing  the  momentum  generated  by  the  fuel  subsidy  reduction;  (ii)  larger  external  debt \nrepayment ($6.5 billion in 2006 as against $4.1 billion in 2005); and (iii) increased domestic debt \namortization  from  Rp20  trillion  to  Rp30  trillion.  The  Paris  Club  debt  rescheduling  reduced  the \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27 \n\nGovernment\u2019s net financing needs to about $2.5 billion in 2005. While the budget deficit and net \nfinancing needs will be lower in 2006, at 0.7% of GDP and $2.3 billion, respectively (from 0.9% \nand $2.5 billion, respectively, in 2005), amortization needs will be higher due to the end of Paris \nClub  rescheduling  arrangements.  The  financing  needs  will  be  met  by  raising  domestic  bond \nissues, sovereign bond issuance, and borrowings from multilateral development banks.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nProgram Management \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n92.  MOF will be the Executing Agency. Implementation of the DPSP actions is coordinated \nwith  a  number  of  other  ministries  and  agencies,  including  BAPPENAS,  Ministry  of  Trade, \nMinistry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and Bank Indonesia.  \n \n \n \n93. \nThe  DPSP  period  is  from  1  January  2005  to  30  June  2006.  All  actions  included  in  the \nPolicy Matrix have been implemented during the course of 2005. The Government and ADB will \nprepare  a  program  completion  report  by  June  2006.  The  DPSP  fits  within  the  overall  reform \nagenda supported under the DPLs, which covers 2003\u20132007.  \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n94. \nThe  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  9)  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the \nproceeds  of  the  program  loan  will be  disbursed  to  the  Republic of  Indonesia  as the  Borrower. \nNo supporting import documentation will be required, if during each year that loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. Disbursements will \nbe made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance with the simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services \nproduced and originating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to \neconomy and efficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard public procedures and \nnormal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the \ninternational commodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to \nthe trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n95. \nThe  reform  needs  supported  under  the  DPSP  will  be  met  through  local  currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the DPSP loan. The provision of DPSP will \nenable  the  Government  to  reorient  its  public  expenditures  towards  high  priority  poverty \nreduction needs. \n \nThe Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \n96. \nand  overall  public  financial  management,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the \nGovernment Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project and from ADB through \nthe  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program.  Reforms  supported  under  both  these \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nprograms  have  led  to  initial  progress  in  strengthening  public  financial  management.  ADB  and \nWorld Bank have jointly undertaken the Country Financial Accountability Assessment in 2001-\n02,32  which  has  been  periodically  updated.  Appendix  8  presents  the  fiduciary  assessment \nundertaken for DPSP/DPL-2, which also has an update on the Country Financial Accountability \nAssessment. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained \n\n \n97. \nthe \nGovernment,  and  all  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  the  Guidelines for  Procurement  under \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  Loans,  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  and  its  Borrowers,  and  the  Loan  Regulations,  were  specifically  brought  to \nthe notice of the Government. \n \n\nto  and  discussed  with \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n98. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation and Program Review \n\n \n99.  MOF,  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,  and  BAPPENAS,  will  be \ncontinuously monitoring the implementation of the DPSP and its impact, in line with the overall \nprogram  framework  and  outcome  indicators  agreed  upon  with  the  Government,  and  submit  to \nADB quarterly reports until the completion of the DPSP. The outcomes of the present phase of \nthe  DPSP/DPL-2  and  the  overall  progress  achieved  will  be  assessed  by  the  Government  and \nthe  development  partners  by  June  2006.  The  forward  looking  phase  of  the  DPSP  will  be \nformulated  in  2006  subject  to  satisfactory  progress,  and  based  on  additional  analytical  and \neconomic and sector work being supported by ADB and other development partners. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nA. \n \n100.  The key benefits expected from the DPSP are \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nin  meeting \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \n\nprogress \n(a) \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  (b)  improved  investment  climate, \nand (c) anticorruption and improved governance; \nconsolidation  of  recent  macroeconomic  and  policy  reforms  leading  to  the \nformulation of a credible medium-term public expenditure framework; \nsustained  engagement  by  ADB  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional  reform  agenda;  the  DPSP  will  provide  for  policy  continuity  and \nconsistency in areas where ADB has been actively involved;  \nfacilitation,  through  cross-cutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or planning support; and \n\n                                                 \n32  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Supporting  Country  Financial  Accountability. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\naid harmonization and parallel financing by the key development partners (ADB, \nWorld Bank, and Government of Japan) around a common policy framework and \ndialogue,  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management. \n\n \nInstitutional.  The  DPSP  will  contribute  to  significant  institutional  development.  The \n101. \npublic expenditure reorientation program being adopted following the reduction in fuel subsidies \nwill  enhance  national  and  local  government  capacity  in  public  service delivery.  In  the  financial \nsector, the Government\u2019s support for LPS will improve public confidence in the banking system. \nThe formulation of a sound FSN will help institutionalize coordination arrangements between the \nGovernment and Bank Indonesia in the resolution of problem banks. In the infrastructure sector, \nthe  DPSP  will  help  establish  KKPPI  to  enable  it  to  effectively  coordinate  infrastructure  policy \ndevelopment.  \n \n102.  Social. The DPSP\u2019s main contribution is in reducing wasteful spending, and supporting \nGovernment  measures  to  effectively  align  its  resources  with  its  medium-term  objectives  of \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies,  particularly  for \nkerosene, has a negative impact on the welfare of the poor. The Government\u2019s compensation \nprogram  aims  to  mitigate  this  impact  by  providing  direct  cash  transfers,  followed  by  a  well-\nrounded  medium-term  development  program.  Appendix  10  presents  a  summary  poverty \nreduction and social impact mitigation strategy. \n \n103.  Economic.  The  nature  of  the  DPSP  does  not  allow  for  quantitative  financial  and \neconomic  analysis.  However,  significant  general  economic  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  entire \nIndonesian population from the policy initiatives under the three core areas of the DPSP. \n \n104.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. The DPSP will cause no direct \nor indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues affecting indigenous peoples. \nBased  on  desk  review,  the  measures  supported  under  the  DPSP  are  unlikely  to  have  any \nadverse environmental impacts. \n \nB. \n \n105.  The DPSP is subject to the following risks: \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  domestic \n\nEconomic volatility could worsen if the Government does not sustain the reform \nmomentum  to  follow  up  on  the  recent  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies  (including \nmaintaining appropriate interest rates and investment climate reforms). This risk \nis  mitigated  by  the  clear  policy  stance  taken  thus  far  by  the  Government  and \nBank  Indonesia.  Following  the  recent  currency  market  volatility,  the  need  for \nrapid  policy  adjustment  on \nline  with  key  global \ndevelopments is clearly recognized.  \nRising  interest  rates  may  trigger  financial  stress  in  debt  markets  with  contagion \neffects on banks and mutual funds. In turn, this may also affect growth prospects. \nThe  Government  remains  committed  to  closely  monitoring  the  economic  impact \nof  the  reforms  adopted  under  the  DPSP,  with  support  from  ADB  and  the  other \ndevelopment partners. \nSocial  tensions  may  increase.  While  the  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies  announced \non 1 October 2005 have thus far not led to any major protests, the success of the \nongoing  unconditional  cash  transfers  program  is  vital  in  containing  public \ndisenchantment.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s  focus  on  ongoing \nevaluation  of  this  program,  with  support  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  The \n\nfront \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fto \n\nformulate  a  broad-based  public  expenditure \n\nGovernment  also  aims \nreorientation program, an area where ADB is actively involved. \nThe external environment is deteriorating as persistently high oil-prices result in a \nslowdown  in  world  economic  growth  and  trade,  and  create  unfavorable \nconditions  in  world  financial  markets.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  package \nannounced  on  1  October  provides  for  attracting  investments  in  the  oil  and  gas \nsector, which in turn will help Indonesia effectively manage its natural resources \nand reap the benefits of any windfall gains. \nAmending  the  tax  laws  is  likely  to  be  a  long  drawn  out  process  and  the  final \nscope  of  the  laws  is  unclear,  given  the  competing  and  conflicting  interests \nbetween  the  needs  for  greater  revenues,  and  the  demands  from  the  private \nsector  for  incentives  and  sound  governance  in  tax  administration.  The  current \nadministrative  procedures  of  the  current  tax  system  have  frequently  raised \nserious  concerns  among  businesses.  Although  progress  has  been  made  in \nmodernizing  tax  offices,  the  tax  system  needs  to  be  strengthened,  given  the \nadministrative  weaknesses,  perception  of  excessive  authority  given  to  tax \nofficials, and the resulting excessive compliance costs. The Government remains \ncommitted to gradually addressing these constraints.  \nHeightened  security  alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional  conflicts  and \nterrorism  could  slow  foreign  direct  investment  and  set  back  the  recovering \ntourism industry. The Government and law enforcement authorities have taken a \nrange of measures aimed at rebuilding public and investor confidence.  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standards  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n106. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined \nunder the DPSP implementation arrangements. \n\nThe policies and actions taken prior to the date of the DPSP loan agreement, as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the DPSP and subsequently. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n107. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve a single-tranche program loan of $200,000,000 to \nthe  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Development  Policy  Support  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility;

Despite a number \nof  unforeseen  difficulties  we  made  significant  progress  on  our  reform  agenda  including  the \ndifficult but critical decisions to reduce unsustainable subsidies by bringing domestic fuel prices \ninto closer alignment with international fuel prices. To cushion the blow of higher fuel prices on \nthe  poor  we  have  instituted  two  major  programs  of  assistance,  a  program  earlier  in  the  year \nfocused on reducing costs of education and health care along with grants for rural infrastructure, \nand a new cash transfer program that is providing Rp.300,000 a quarter to 15.5 million families \nover the next year. We believe that these steps and improvements to the investment climate and \ngovernance have laid the foundation for sustained high quality growth.  In this letter we would \nlike to take the opportunity to highlight our policy agenda for the year ahead and beyond.  \n\nA year ago the Government had just come into office and our focus was, of necessity, on existing \npolicy  initiatives  and  a  transitional  strategy  from  the  previous  administration\u2019s  agenda.  Now, \nhowever,  the  Government  has  developed  and  is  implementing  our  own  strategy  through  our \nMedium Term Development Plan (RPJM) for 2004-2009 and our Annual Work Plan (RKP) for \n2006.  In these plans our Government has set ourselves ambitious development goals, and it is \nthese Government plans and our commitment to achieve our Indonesian development goals that \nunderpin this year\u2019s Letter of Development Policy.  \n\nOur   partnership  with  your  institutions  on  this year\u2019s  Development  Policy  Loan (DPL)  was \nbuilt  on   your   active   support  for   the   reform   agenda  we  laid  out  last   year  and   it   has  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nbeen  a  successful  partnership.  We  very  much  welcomed  your  commitment  at  the  Consultative \nGroup for Indonesia (CGI) meeting January 2005 of an additional DPL program Loan in FY2005 \nin line with sufficient Government progress on the indicative reform agenda agreed to last year \nwith the World Bank, JBIC and the ADB on various policy and sector reforms. We believe that \nwe have met virtually all policy actions in the World Bank High Case and DPL or they will be \ncomplete  shortly,  and  reforms  in  a  number  of  areas  have  far  exceeded  expectations.  The \nGovernment of Indonesia very much appreciates the commitment from your institutions to work \nwith us on medium term reforms as reliable development financing partners. Our financing needs \nremain large in 2005 and beyond and it is important for financing and the continuity of reforms \nthat  both  parties  commit  to  an  annual  loan  based  on  an  accurate  but  flexible  assessment  of \nprogress  on  a  mutually  agreed  reform  agenda.  This  letter  is  in  support  of  our  request  that  the \nWorld  Bank  approve  a  US$400  million  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  a  US$200  million \nprogram loan to disburse in FY2005. \n\nletter:  supporting  macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness; \n\nWe  are  now  concluding  the  assessment  of  progress  on  the  three  reform  pillars  laid  out  in  last \nthe \nyear\u2019s \ninvestment  climate;  and  improving  public  financial  management  and  governance.    Looking  to \nthe future, we propose to continue these priorities as they are essential to sustained growth and \npoverty  reduction.  However  we  would  like  to  increase  the  emphasis  on  poverty  reduction  and \nmake this explicit by adding a fourth pillar that increases the focus on social development and \npro-poor spending. Further, we envision that this would be the beginning of a transition of our \nprogram  with  you  toward  achieving  Indonesia\u2019s  MDG  linked  goals  and  in  particular  our \nmedium-term commitments in the RPJM. \n\nimproving \n\nA.  Macroeconomic Outlook \n \nThis  year  has  been  a  good  one  for  growth  in  Indonesia.  In  the  first  half  of  2005  GDP  growth \npicked up dramatically to grow 5.9 percent, with investment growing an even more robust 13.6 \npercent. Investment has now clearly taken over from private consumption (at 3.3 percent in the \nfirst  half)  as  the  leading  driver  of  our  growth  process.    This  growth  in  investment  has  been \ncomplimented  by  high  growth  in  exports  and  capital  imports  setting  the  stage  for  continued \ngrowth in the 6 percent range this year and next. \n \nDespite the improving growth outlook, there have been macroeconomic disturbances this year in \nfinancial  markets,  especially  late  August  and  early  September  when  the  exchange  rate \ndepreciated rapidly and interest rates rose abruptly. Inflation has also increased due, in part, to \nthe depreciation in the exchange rate, but in larger part, to the increases in fuel prices including \nthe 29 percent increase in March, the increases in industrial fuel prices starting in July and the \nlarge increase in October. Finally when international oil prices rose to US$70 a barrel and our \nsubsidies grew dramatically concerns about the fiscal position also mounted. \n \nIn  response  to  rising uncertainties about both the monetary and fiscal position the Central Bank \nand    the  Government  adopted  a  multi-part  strategy  announced  by  the  President    the  31th  of \nAugust  2005.  The  Central  Bank  increased  the  interest  rate  on  the  key  one-month  Central \nbank  instrument  by  125  basis  points  in  early  September,  followed  by  another  100 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 37\n\n \n \nbasis points in early October and indicated its readiness to increase again if needed. For its part \nthe government announced that it would substantially reduce fuel subsidies on October 1st after \nfirst  putting  into  place  a  cash  compensation  program  to  mitigate  the  impact  on  the  poorest \nfamilies  and  an  incentive  package  for  workers  and  businesses.  As  noted,  in  early  October  the \nGovernment rolled out a cash compensation program to provide Rp.300,000 per household per \nquarter  to  15.5  million  households.  With  the  cash  transfer  in  process  on  October  3rd  the \ngovernment  raised  fuel  prices  on  the  remaining  subsidized  kerosene,  gasoline  and  automotive \ndiesel  prices.  The  incentive  package  included:  measures  for  workers  such  as  a  substantial \nincrease in the taxable income threshold; for businesses a reduction in tariffs on capital goods, \nthe  elimination  of  the  VAT  on  agriculture  products  and  a  reduction  in  the  Transport  Handling \nCharge (THC); specifically for the transportation industry tariffs for spare parts were reduced or \neliminated,  a  large  number  of  local  government  regulations  that  raise  transport  costs  were \nabolished  and  weigh  stations  reduced.  With  this  fuel  price  increase  in  place  prices  of  gasoline \nand diesel are now above 70 percent of world prices. While kerosene remains heavily subsidized \nit is now 35 percent of the world price. With these adjustments in place we believe that we are on \ntrack to achieve a budget deficit target of 0.7 percent by the end of the year. \n \nThe  Market  has  responded  favorably  to  these  moves  with  the  exchange  rate  strengthening  and \nthe  stock  market  rising  since  the  beginning  of  September.  However,  we  now  anticipate  a \nsignificant increase in inflation as higher fuel prices pass through the economy and inflation is \nestimated to reach at least 12 percent at its peak before falling back to  around 8 percent by the \nend of 2006. We also anticipate that higher interest rates and the adjustment to higher fuel prices \nmay slow economic growth in the 4th quarter and early next year. However, this impact will be \ndampened as spending on subsidies is shifted to infrastructure and social spending. There should \nbe an additional bonus as policy uncertainty is reduced and investment sentiment recovers. Given \nthese changes we now estimate that growth in 2005 will be 5.8 percent before recovering to the \n6.2  percent  range  by  the  end  of  2006  and  to  the  7  percent  range  in  the  medium  term  as  the \neconomy completes its adjustment. \n \nB.  Other Issues \n \nBefore  turning  explicitly  to  the  reform  agendas  in  the  areas  of  macroeconomic  stability, \nthe  investment  climate  and  public  financial  management  we  would  like  to  touch  on  a few \nother  issues  of  critical  importance  to  Indonesian  development.   As  you  are  aware  last  \nDecember\u2019s    tragedy    in    Aceh    and    Nias    put    the    government    under    a  great  deal  of  extra  \npressure, and  has  almost  certainly slowed  progress  on  reform. However, even more critically \nwhile reconstruction is now picking up we are far from satisfied with the progress achieved to \nrebuild  people  lives  and  livelihoods.  We    have    established    a    ministerial    level  Aceh  \nReconstruction  Agency,  a  first  for  Indonesia, and  we  expect   that it  will  not  only speed up  \ndevelopment, but  mprove the quality of outcomes and set new standards for governance.  The \npeace  settlement  with  GAM  has  added to  confidence  that  this  could  be  a turning point for \nyour\nmuch \nthe \n\nappreciate \n\nprovince. \n\nvery \n\nrole \n\nWe \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n \ninstitutions have  played  and we remain mindful of the need to improve budget and coordination \nprocesses to deliver results on the ground. \n \nAs the President noted in his address to the International Parliamentarian Conference in Helsinki, \n2005 has brought a new threat more dangerous than a Tsunami to Indonesia. As you are aware \nthe Avian Influenza has already killed a number of our citizens as part of a world wide outbreak \nand infections continue to be detected in birds across the country. The government proposes to \naddress  this  emerging  crisis  as  part  of  our  commitment  to  social  welfare  and  to  mitigate  the \ncatastrophic  risk  that  an  avian  influenza  pandemic  would  represent.  In  particular,  we  are \ndeveloping and funding an AI control strategy and action plan, including both human and animal \nhealth aspects.   \n \nThe fight against corruption is one of the top priorities in our agenda. Strong backing has been \nprovided  for  the  newly  established  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK)  and  specialized  Anti-\nCorruption  Court.    These  efforts  are  yielding  promising  results.  Convictions  in  several  high \nprofile graft cases have been handed down. Yet, much remains to be done in terms of reducing \nthe opportunities for corruption at the systemic and institutional level and we intend to continue \nto push ahead with this agenda. \n \nIn  this  context,  civil  service  reforms  remain  an  important  reform  issue.  We  realize  that \nadministrative  capacity  and  incentives  in  the  government  bureaucracy  exert  a  drag  on \nimplementation in policy areas. We strongly believe that the civil service reform agenda should \nbe reinvigorated in order to improve service delivery, enable a more positive investment climate \nand  reduce  corruption.  To  provide  this,  we  are  planning  to  establish  an  empowered  high-level \nModernization Team to strategize and manage the reform process. The Team would be mandated \nand required to develop a comprehensive road map and strategy for civil service reform, which \nwould include specific measures to clarify the organization of civil service management; move \nthe public administration toward a performance orientation and introduce merit-based practices \nto  the  civil  service;  control  the  fiscal  weight of  the  civil  service  wage  bill;  strengthen  regional \nand local government administrative capacity and accountability and introduce strong elements \nof competency- and skills-based training. \n \nC.  Indicative forward-looking program of the Government \n \nOur Medium term plan focuses on 3 broad objectives: a Safe and Peaceful Indonesia; a Just and \nDemocratic Indonesia; and a prosperous Indonesia. These in limited to 7 priorities in the 2006 \nwork plan: \n\n1)  Reduction in poverty and disparity, \n2)  Increased employment opportunities (including through increased investment and \n\nexports), \n\n3)  Revitalized agriculture and rural development, \n4)  Improved access to and quality of education and health services, \n5)  The eradication of corruption; bureaucratic reform; and law enforcement, \n6)  A stronger defense; law and order; and improved conflict resolution, and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n 39\n\n \n\n  \n\n7)  Rehabilitating and reconstructing Aceh and Nias. \n\n \n \nTo provide focus and continuity this Letter of Development Policy builds on Poverty Reduction \n(Priority 1), Employment Generation (Priority 2), Access to Heath and Education (Priority 4) and \nGovernance  (Priority  5).  For  example,  our  Annual  Action  Plan  observes  that  a  sustained \nreduction  in  poverty  and  reduced  inequality  depends  fundamentally  on  sound  macroeconomic \nfoundations:  especially  low  inflation  and  prudent  fiscal  policy  as  high  inflation  has  a \ndisproportionate  impact  on  poverty  and  high  debt  levels  and  an  uncertain  fiscal  stance  affect \ninterest  and  exchange  rate  expectations  raising  the  cost  of  funds  and  risking  exchange  rate \nturbulence. An improved investment climate designed to create jobs and economic momentum is \nat the heart of the agenda for Priority 2 and improved Public Financial Management is central to \nvirtually all areas of government operations. As noted in this Letter of Development Policy we \nare  adding  an  emphasis  on  reducing  poverty  and  income  uncertainty  (again  Priority  1)  and \nimproved education and health service (Priority 4). \n \nMacroeconomic stability  \n \nMacroeconomic  stability  continues  to  underlie  our  basic  strategy  and  we  intend  to  focus  on \ncontrolling inflation, the reallocation of untargeted subsidies, fiscal consolidation, a prudent sub-\nnational  borrowing  framework,  a  better  institutional  design  to  assess  and  set  fiscal  policy  and \nimproved stability and functioning of the financial sector. \n\nInflation has been on the rise this year due, in part to the run up in the exchange rate and, in part, \nto fuel price increases. With the latest increase in fuel prices inflation will rise further and now \nrepresents  a  potential  challenge  to  macroeconomic  stability  and  poverty  reduction.  Bank \nIndonesia,  in  cooperation  with  the  Government,  will  continue  to  focus  monetary  policy  on \nbringing inflation back to the 8 percent range by the end of 2006 in anticipation of a return to an \ninflation  targeting  strategy  designed  to  bring  Indonesia  into  line  with  regional  averages  in  the \nmedium term. To do this we will work together with the Central Bank to convey a clear message \ndesigned to dampen inflation expectations and prevent a pass-through into additional uncertainty \nand higher interest rates.  \n \nThe Government will continue to focus on fiscal consolidation. With the increase in fuel prices \non October 3, the Government\u2019s fiscal outlook is much improved. We are now confident that we \ncan  achieve  our  budget  deficit  targets  for  2005  and  2006  and  additional  funds  from  reduced \nsubsidies can be reallocated to increased social spending and infrastructure. Specifically in next \nyear\u2019s budget in addition to continuing the cash transfers we are budgeting substantial increases \nfor the social sectors (schools, health clinics), and small scale and rural infrastructure (especially \nroads). In fact the sum of these programs will reach 60 percent of the funds reallocated from the \nsubsidy reduction. Nevertheless we remain mindful that the recent run-up in world oil prices and \nfixed  domestic  prices  jeopardized  our  fiscal  position,  economic  efficiency  and  needed  energy \ndiversification  (especially  toward  increased  use  of  coal  and  gas).  Thus,  the  government \nregulation (Perpres 55/2005) that raised fuel prices on October 3, also signals the government\u2019s \nintent to continue to reallocate untargeted subsidies and to a continuing adjustment of domestic \nprices to market ones.  \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \nDespite  substantial  progress  in  bringing  down  the  government  debt  to  GDP  ratio  our  fiscal \nsituation  remains  fragile  as  we  note  from  the recent  jump  in  government  borrowing  rates.  Our \ndebt to GDP ratio is now around 50 percent of GDP down from 54 percent of GDP at the end of \n2004. We propose to continue this trend reduction and our goal is a ratio of government debt to \nGDP of 30-35 percent debt by 2009. To achieve this, the Government will propose to Parliament \na deficit for 2006 at 0.7 percent of GDP. Our strategy to bring inflation into line with regional \naverages  and  bring  down  our  debt  to  GDP  ratio  should  dramatically  lower  government \nborrowing rates, with the added benefit of lowering interest rates for the private sector crowding \nin investment and extending maturities, with particular impact on the quality of growth and the \nability to fund infrastructure.  \n \nDespite relatively low deficits, gross financing needs remain large and the government needs an \neffective borrowing and debt management strategy. And in September the Finance Ministry and \nthe Planning Ministry presented such a strategy to Parliament. In particular the debt management \nstrategy  (No.  447/KMK.06/2005)  presented  focuses  on  various  risks  (interest,  exchange  rate, \nmaturity, etc.) and the need for balance and diversification. In sum, while market conditions will \ndictate strategy at any given moment, we propose to gradually increase the share of government \ndebt denominated in rupiah. We will also attempt to extend the average maturity and reduce the \nshare  of  debt  at  variable  rate.  Over  the  next  year  we  will  improve  our  capability  to  monitor, \nreport and assess our debt position. This will be done by publishing (and placing on our website) \nan  integrated  quarterly  (domestic  and  foreign)  debt  report.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  also \ncontinue  to  improve  its  capacity  to  quantitatively  assess  the  risks  indicated  above.  Finally,  the \nGovernment  proposes  to  undertake  a  program  to  assess  and  catalogue  various  contingent \nliabilities.  As  part  of  next  year\u2019s  program  we  will  extend  and  update  projections  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  contingent  liabilities  including  to  State  Owned  Enterprises,  and  public  pension \nfunds.  \n\nUnder  Law  33/2004  regional  governments  are  empowered  to  borrow  from  capital  markets  (to \ndevelop  local  infrastructure).  International  experience  has  demonstrated  the  significant \nmacroeconomic  risks  from  imprudent  sub-national  borrowing.  Thus  the  Government  is \ncommitted  to  improving  the  regulatory  framework  for  sub-national  government  bond  issuance \nand developing remedies and work out procedures in case of default. While we will have shortly \ncompleted  the  government  regulations  and  ministerial  decrees  to  operationalize  on-lending  our \nown  funds  and  foreign  loans  to  regional  governments,  elements  of  this  agenda  remain \nincomplete.  In  particular  we  are  finishing  a  Finance  ministry  decree  that  operationalizes  on-\ngranting  to  regional  governments  and  revisiting  the  procedures  at  the  Planning  Ministry  that \ndetermine  the  submission  and  appraisal  process  for  projects  to  be  financed/funded  by  on-\nlending/on-granting  (The  Blue  Book)  as  well  as  loan/grant  disbursement,  administration  and \nmonitoring/evaluation  procedures.    To  improve  both  regional  government  access  to  capital \nmarkets and our own on-lending/on-granting procedures we propose to set up a clearing house of \ninformation  on  regional  government  arrears  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  share  this \ninformation,  with  due  consideration  to  confidentiality,  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  to \nBappenas and the Ministry of Home Affairs.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 41\n\n \n \nAs we indicated last year, the Government remains committed to longer-term fiscal sustainability \nand  macroeconomic  stability  by  broadening  the  base  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  non-oil \nrevenue  sources  (especially  taxes,  but  also  including  excises  and  other  revenues).  To  continue \nour commitment to improving the investment climate this needs to be done while minimizing the \nburden  on  the  business  community  and  private  citizens.  The  main  effort  to  improve  tax \ncollections  and  the  tax  environment  will  continue  to  involve  the  expansion  of  the  modern  tax \noffice  and  the  amendments  to  the  tax  laws  now  in  Parliament.  However,  this  year  we  are  also \ncommitting  to  improving  the  foundation  for  making  fiscal  and  especially  tax  policy  and  tariff \nsetting  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  A  principle  of  the  reorganization  of  the  Ministry  was  the \nseparation of analysis and implementation. A next step here involves developing a source of tax \npolicy  capacity  and  advice  outside  the  Tax  Department  capable  of  finding  and  addressing  the \nbalance  between  tax  payers  rights  and  the  needs  of  the  State.  Thus,  in  2006,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  proposes  to  improve  its  capability  to  effectively  assess  tax  and  tariff  policies,  among \nother policy areas, by establishing a Fiscal Policy Office with a tax unit capable of systematic tax \npolicy  analysis.  This  will  be  done  by  creating  an  institutional  design,  developing  terms  of \nreference and a staffing plan for an office operational in 2007.  Other efforts include improving \nthe usefulness and dissemination of tax data to allow improved tax forecasting and analysis units \n(including  by  the  proposed  Fiscal  Policy  Office,  and  revised  operating  and  administrative \nprocedures for Team Tariff.  \n \nImproving  our  financial  system  is  also  a  key  priority  to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability.  An \nincrease  in  inflation  and  interest  rates  \u2013  due  to  the  recent  increase  in  fuel  prices  -  will  be \naccompanied  by  rising  levels  of  Non-Performing  Loans  (NPLs)  and  stress  on  Banks  and  Non-\nBank  Financial  Institutions.  In  2005,  Bank  Indonesia  has  introduced  new  measures  to  improve \nrisk management, strengthen minimum capital requirements and new requirements on consumer \nprotection. While we believe the Banking system to be in relatively good health and able to deal \nwith  this  threat,  we  are  committed  to  maintaining  continued  vigilance  in  regulation  and \nsupervision.  In 2006, we intend to continue to phase out the blanket guarantee for the banking \nsystem that began this year with the creation and endowment of a Deposit Insurance Agency and \nthe elimination of the guarantee on interbank loans. By September of next year, deposits up to a \nmaximum of Rp. 1 billion will be covered \u2013 on the way to the ultimate target of Rp. 100 million \nof coverage by March 2007. We will strengthen the framework for resolution of problem banks \nby  ensuring  that  the  roles  of  Bank  Indonesia,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  LPS  to  act  in  such \nsituations are clear and that sound institutional arrangements are in place.  We propose to create \na Financial Sector Stability Forum that will provide key technical inputs into the decision making \nof  Coordination  Committee  that  will  oversee  the  resolution  of  problem  banks.  Overall,  during \n2006, we plan to have a well established financial sector safety net in place.  \n \nWe   are  aware  that Indonesia needs to diversify its financial sector from its over-reliance on the \nbanking  sector.  Indonesia  also  needs  to  develop  sources  of  long-term  domestic  capital  in \norder  to  finance  its  many  development  needs \u2013 including infrastructure. In 2006, we  propose \nthat  are  key \nto  strengthen  non-bank  financial \nto \n\ntake  several  steps \n\ninstitutions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n \nsources  for  such  long-term  resources.    Building  on  the  work  undertaken  in  the  area  of  capital \nmarkets,  we  will  develop  and  issue  a  formal  strategy  to  guide  the  development  of  the  NBFIs \nmarket in the medium-term. Prudential regulations governing the operation of finance companies \nwill be issued as a Ministerial decree. In the capital markets area, we propose to issue prudential \nregulations  for  municipal  bonds  -  thereby  enabling  the  development  of  this  market,  as  well  as \nregulations governing the operation of secondary markets for government debt. We will also take \nsteps  to  strengthen  and  further  develop  the  mutual  fund  industry  \u2013  especially  after  the  recent \nstress  experienced  by  this  industry.  Institutionally,  we  plan  to  complete  the  merger  between \nBAPEPAM  and  DGFI  \u2013  enabling  their  smooth  operation.        We  will  also  be  focusing  our \nattention on significantly upgrading the capacity of the merged entity.  \n  \nImproving the investment climate \n \nHowever,  macroeconomic  stability  will  not,  by  itself  deliver  the  jobs,  growth  and  economic \ndynamism  that  we  want  and  we  remain  fully  committed  to  attracting  broad  based  investment \n(foreign and domestic) and adding infrastructure, in cooperation with the private sector to sustain \nand  accelerate  growth.  There  has  been  progress  in  a  number  of  areas  that  should  improve  the \ninvestment climate and we are pleased to indicate that new laws are at or approaching Parliament \nin a number of areas. Nevertheless, more is needed to meet investor concerns. In particular we \nintend to push reforms in the areas of business start-up, taxes and customs, trade restrictions and \ninfrastructure in the year ahead. \n \nTo improve the business climate the government intends to follow up on its pledge to reduce the \ntime to register a firm from the oft cited 151 days in 2005 to 30 days or less. The new investment \nlaw will only be considered by Parliament in 2006, but there are a number of measures to reduce \nthe  time  to  start  a  business  and  reduce  costs  that  would  complement  the  new  law  and  can  be \nundertaken  independently.  Thus  we  intend  to  move ahead  on  reducing the time to register and \nlegalize a company by streamlining business registration, company formation and licensing. For \nexample, and in addition, the Ministry of Trade has indicated that they are reviewing 77 licenses \nwith  the  goal  of  eliminating  unnecessary  ones,  while  simplifying  and  combining  others.  This \neffort will be extended to other ministries. The DG of Tax will continue to improve service to the \nbusiness  community  by  speeding  up  refunds,  simplifying  tax  preparation  and  submission  and \nredressing  administration  concerns  this  is  in  addition  to  or  as  part  of  our  main  focus  on \nexpanding  the  modern  tax  offices.  In  the  area  of  improve  Customs  we  intend  to  continue  to \nreduce time to clear customs, and increase the number of compliant importers with access to the \nGreen line.   \n \nIn  response  to  concerns  about  regional  obstacles  to  investment,  in  2005,  the  Government \ncompleted  and  submitted  to  Parliament  a  new  law  on  regional  taxation   that  establishes a   \nstrict  positive list  for  allowable  regional   taxes  and charges.   Next  year  we  propose   to \nfollow-up    the    implementation    of    this  law    by  enacting  and    implementing    government \nregulations   designed  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  positive  list,   while  assessing   the \nadequacy   of   the   current   list   in   line   with   the   new   government   regulation   on service \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 43\n\n \n \nassignments.  An area of weakness has been the delivery of basic public services in our cities, \nwhich  not  only  jeopardizes  our  MDG  goals  but  also  affects  the  investment  climate  through \nhigher costs and a degraded environment. Thus a priority this year is to clarify the legal status of \nregional  public  enterprises  (water  companies,  for  example)  including  their  fiscal  and  financial \nrelationships  with  regional  governments  by  drafting  a  new  law  on  Regional  Public  Enterprises \n(BUMD). With their status clarified these critical enterprises will be able to increase investments \nand improve service delivery outcomes across Indonesia.  \n \nThe Government will continue to address the issue of regional obstacles and trade policy more \nbroadly through an amended Trade Law designed to improve the framework for for domestic and \ninternational  trade  through  among  other  things  submission  to  Parliament  of  a  trade  bill  that \nimproves the efficiency of domestic and international trade, through submission to the President \nof a draft trade bill to ensure the free movement of goods within the country and a competitive \ntrade regime.  \n \nAs  part  of  the  measures  to  strengthen  Indonesia's  infrastructure  program  and  enhance  its \ninternational credibility among investors and financiers, the Government proposes to establish a \ncross-sectoral  Public  Private  Partnership  (PPP)  and  Risk  Management  Framework.  These  are \nneeded  to  deepen  infrastructure  coordination  and  develop  clear  procedures  for  ensuring \nappropriate risk sharing. To achieve this we propose to establish a Risk Management Unit within \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  with  adequate  resources  and  funding.    We  will  also  provide  a  budget \nallocation  for  public  budget  support  to  PPP  transactions  in  infrastructure  including  both  cash \n(i.e., subsidies), and non-cash (i.e., guarantees and other forms of contingent liabilities), if any. \nThis will be part of our normal budget submission.  To make our PPP framework operational we \nwill issue the required regulations needed to complement Keppres 7 including a KKPPI Decree \ncreating  a  PPP  Implementation  Framework,  and  publication  of  policies  and  procedures  for  the \nprovision  of  government  support  to  PPPs.  Finally,  we  anticipate  issuing  the  initial  list  of  PPP \nprojects  to  be  offered  for  bidding  to  the  private  sector  under  adequate  international  bidding \nstandards.  \n \nFiduciary reforms  \n \nIn  the  area  of  governance  and  fiduciary  reforms  we  propose  to  extend  the  reform  agenda \ncurrently  underway.  Areas  of  emphasis  will  include  procurement,  improving  budget  processes, \nextending the Treasury Single Account, and improving accounting standards. \n \nThe    President    has    taken    an    active    interest    in    Procurement    Policy;    emphasizing    its \nimportance    to    governance    issues   and    his    anti-corruption    agenda.    He    has    asked    us    to \nelevate   this   issue   by   creating  a  high   level   procurement   policy  body   that  reports \ndirectly   to  him.  This   effort will build on a   foundation created with Presidential   Regulation  \n80/2003    and    the      establishment      at      the      Planning      Agency      of      the    nucleus      of  an   \noperational   Procurement  Policy Office. In line with Keppres 80/2003 Chapter 6, section 50a \nthe Government will establish and staff an independent National Procurement Policy Office.  \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n \nWhile  we  put  in  place  this  national  level  office  we  will  also  be  pushing  ahead  with  the \ndevelopment and dissemination of e-procurement and standard bidding documents.  \n\n \n\nProblems  with  budget  systems  and  disbursement  became  were  a  serious  issue  in  2005.  The \ncombination of a late start to the budget year due to the change in government, new processes \n(including a new budget format) and the reorganization at the Ministry of Finance combined to \nslow  disbursement.  We  believe  that  most  of  the  problems  have  been  solved  and  we  do  not \nanticipate  a  repeat  of  this  year\u2019s  problem  in  2006.  However,  we  also  recognize  that  additional \nbudget reforms are needed. One difficulty has been the lack of clear information on the state of \nbudget disbursements at a sufficient level of detail. Thus we will produce a quarterly report on \nbudget  spending  by  organizations  and  regular  semi-annual  reports  according  to  economic  and \nfunctional categories that we will be put in the public domain. However, another important task \nis to improve the quality of our budgeting process at entry; that is the design and development of \nprograms  needed  to  make  performance  based  budgeting  and  MTEF  practicable.  To  do  this  we \npropose to create a task force combining elements of the Ministry of Finance and the Planning \nMinistry  to  review  program  structures,  propose  revisions  and  provide  improved  guidance  and \ntraining to line ministries for the development of the 2008 budget (required by end 2006). \n \nWe also intend to extend the development of the new Treasury system and the development of a \nTreasury Single Account system. Over the next year this will involve extending the zero-balance \npilot now underway to most or all Treasury offices in the country. We will also begin to bring \nFinance accounts including the RDI/RDA and oil transitory accounts into the Governments BUN \naccount. We will also continue the process of account consolidation by establishing a system to \nbring  off-budget  accounts  from  outside  the  Ministry  of  Finance  into  the  Treasury  Single \nAccount. \n  \nTransparency and good governance can only be achieved when reporting systems are timely and \naccurate. Thus we propose to improve accounting standards in this year\u2019s letter. The Government \nproposes  two  priorities.  The  first  priority  builds  on  this  year\u2019s  first  un-audited  consolidated \nfinancial  statement  issued  in  May  2005  (for  the  fiscal  year  ending  December  31,  2004)  by \nimproving  the  quality  and  completeness  of  information  on  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  and \nmost  importantly  focusing  on  reconciling  financial  transactions  by  different  units  within  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Line  Ministries.  The  second \npriority is to improve sub-national fiscal reporting standards by rationalizing existing reporting \nsystems and increasing the timeliness of reports (by amending PP 105). \n \nSocial Development and Pro-Poor Spending \n\nWith  this  year\u2019s  letter  of  Development  Policy  we  are  introducing  a  new  focus  on   social \ndevelopment  and  pro-poor  spending.  This   commitment   is   based   on   the   Government\u2019s \ngoal  of  achieving   the   Millennium   Development    Goals   by 2015   and  our  own   medium-\nterm  development   goals   set   fort   in   the   RPJM by 2009. This year we propose to continue \nthe  earlier  focus  on   macroeconomic stability, the investment  climate,   and   public   financial  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n45\n\n \n\n\f \n\nTable A2.1: Development Policy Support Program \nPolicy Matrix \n \n\nPolicy Actions \n\nSummary of Achievements \n\n1. Improved Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness \n\n1.1.  Make  progress  in  reducing  subsidies  to  the  non-\npoor. \n\n4\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n \n\ni\n\nIn  2005,  the  Government  has  made  bold  and  commendable  progress  to  reduce  fuel \nsubsidies. In March, fuel prices were increased by 29% on average. Subsequently, the \nGovernment  increased  fuel  prices  by  a  further  126.6%  on  average  on  1  October, \nbringing  domestic  fuel  prices  closer  to  international  prices.  It  also  announced  an \nautomatic  price  adjustment  mechanism,  under  which  the  ministries  concerned  have \nbeen  tasked  with  decisions  on  price  adjustments,  thus  effectively  depoliticizing  the \nprocess.   \nThe Government has initiated the reorientation of the potential savings from fuel subsidy \nreduction to high priority poverty reduction programs. The Budget for 2005 has allocated \n$1.8  billion  for  a  comprehensive  pro-poor  compensation  program  aimed  at  enhancing \neducation, health, and rural infrastructure investments. Development expenditures have \nbeen scaled up by 1.3% of GDP ($3 billion) in the 2006 budget. The Government has \nindicated  its  commitment  to  further  raise  public  expenditures  for  social  and  poverty \nprograms, to be financed by potential fuel savings and tightening of other expenditures \nand programs that are not performing well. \nAll  tax  offices  in  Jakarta  were  modernized  by  upgrading  hardware  and  software.  In \naddition,  the  President  has  submitted  to  the  Parliament  a  comprehensive  tax  reform \npackage,  comprising  legal,  regulatory,  and  procedural  amendments  to  tax  laws.  The \namendments provide a range of incentives to individual as well as corporate taxpayers \n \nThe Government has expanded the tax base by issuing taxpayer identification cards to \nabout  10  million  individual/corporate  taxpayers,  up  from  about  3.5  million  taxpayers  at \nthe end of 2004. Due in part to these measures, non-oil tax revenues increased by 26% \nby the end of August 2005. \nPublic  debt  has  been  reduced  from  91%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2000  to \n52% in June 2005. Of this, outstanding domestic debt has declined from 47% to 25% of \nGDP, while external public debt has declined from 44% to 27% over the same period. \nThe Government has successfully re-profiled its debt, smoothening and lengthening the \nmaturity profile. The Government has also adopted a system of publishing consolidated \ndebt information in the public domain, with the latest quarterly data available for June. \n \nTo sustain the progress, the Government aims to reduce public debt to 30% of GDP by \n2010.  The  minister  of  finance  has  issued  a  decree  (KMK  06/2005)  outlining  the \nGovernment\u2019s  debt  strategy  to  Parliament  that,  among  others,  lays  out  guidelines  for \n\n1.2.

Bappenas and \nMOF  have  initiated  revisions  to  their  project  approval  procedures,  with  the  aim  of \nincreasing \nlocal \ngovernments  and  streamlining annual and medium-term  planning.  The  adoption  of  the \nrevised decree and new procedures will simplify and facilitate regional development at \nthe decentralized levels in Indonesia. \n\ntransparency  and  consistency \n\ninformation  sharing  with \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nThe  Government  has  prepared  a  new  investment  law  (intended  to  replace  the  1967 \ninvestment  law),  providing  a  modern  and  simpler  legal  framework,  essentially  moving \ntowards  a  registration-oriented  system  (as  opposed  to  the  earlier  approval-driven \nsystem). All interministerial consultations are complete, and agreement reached on the \nconceptual framework. The draft is being reviewed by the Ministry of Law and Human \nRights, pending submission to the President. Under the program, the Government has \nstrengthened  the  National  Team  for  Increasing  Exports  and  Investments  through  a \nPresidential  decree.  These  national  measures  are  complemented  by  efforts  to  reduce \nnuisance  taxes  and  regulations  at  the  local  government  level,  which  have  been \nsupported  under  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment Program, approved on 3 November 2005 by ADB. \n\nA  Presidential  decree  No.42/2005  has  been  issued  to  strengthen  the  National \nCommittee  for  the  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure  Development  (KKPPI).    KKPPI  was \noperationalized in 2005 and has been coordinating infrastructure sector policy, legal and \nregulatory issues, besides reviewing specific transactions.   \n\nNew Presidential decree No.67/2005 signed to facilitate private sector participation and \npublic-private partnerships. \n\nMOF  has  established  a  committee  to  initiate  the  formulation  of  a  risk  management \nframework.

The  Government \naims  to  create  up  to  6  million  new  SME  entrepreneurs  by  2009  and  strengthen  the \n70,000 cooperatives currently under operation serving over 20 million members.  \n\nThe phased removal of the blanket guarantee began on 22 September 2005, with only \nthird-party deposits being covered. The LPS, approved by Parliament, was inaugurated \non 3 October 2005, with a capitalization of Rp4 trillion. Bank Indonesia and MOF have \nagreed on a joint memorandum of understanding for resolution of problem banks, which \nis  now  being  enhanced  by  including  the  LPS  as  a  responsible  party.  The  revised \nmemorandum  of  understanding  is  scheduled  to  be  adopted  in  early  2006.  In  addition, \nMOF and Bank Indonesia are collaborating in establishing the Financial Stability Forum, \nwhich will deal with resolution of systemic crisis.  \nAs  part  of  its  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  the  banking  sector,  Bank  Indonesia \nformulated  the  new  Indonesian  banking  architecture  in  2004,  outlining  a  range  of \nmeasures.    To  operationalize  this  plan,  Bank  Indonesia  has  adopted  a  number  of \nregulations during the course of the Program in the areas indicated in the policy action, \nand as outlined in the text of the Report and Recommendation of the President. The key \noutcomes  include  (i)  increasing  the  tier  1  minimum  capital  requirements  gradually  to \nRp100 billion ($10 million) by 31 December 2010, up from the Rp50 billion limit in effect \nsince  1993;  (ii)  provision  of  intraday  liquidity  support  to  banks;  (iii)  measures  to \nintroduce good corporate governance in banks; (iv) new risk management requirements; \n(v)  establishment  of  a  credit  bureau  in  Bank  Indonesia;  (vi)  introduction  of  asset \nsecuritization; and (vii) adoption of new regulations to enhance customer protection.    \nThe  Government  has  actively  implemented  the  Non-Bank  Financial  Sector  (NBFS) \nAction  Plan,  developed  in  fulfillment  of  the  ADB-supported  Financial  Governance  and \nSocial Security Program and endorsed by the Minister of Finance in December 2004 \n\nThe  Government  has  merged  the  Directorate  General  of  Financial  Institutions  in  MOF \nand  the  Capital  Market  Supervisory  Agency,  through  a  Presidential  decree  adopted  in \nOctober  2005.  The  Government  has  pursued  regulatory  sanctions  against  several \nnonperforming insurance companies.  \n\n4. Improved Public Financial Management and Strengthening Anticorruption \n\n4.1.

Drafting work is underway for the 7 regulations under the State Audit Law. \n\nThe  Government  has  drawn  up  a  timetable  and  an  activity  plan  for  the  TSA,  with \nsupport  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  A  State  Treasury  Office  in  Jakarta  has \nadopted the TSA system on a pilot basis, and the Government aims to cover 70% of all \nGovernment accounts by end-2006 under the TSA. \n\nMOF IG\u2019s office has been significantly strengthened with resources as well as authority \nto enable effective investigations. The minister of finance has issued a decree providing \nthe  legal  framework  to  guide  the  IG\u2019s  work.  The  IG  has  thus  far  conducted  39 \ninvestigations, of which 35 were completed with 28 findings of guilt leading to sanctions \nagainst 67 individuals.  \n\nNote: The actions indicated under item 1.2 and item 3.2 were not included in the original DPL 2 triggers.

The \neducation  program  aims  at  reducing  school  fees  and  the  health  program \naims at reducing fees and increasing access of the poor to clinics and third \nclass  hospitals.  These  programs  will  need  to  be  assessed.  While  progress \nhas  been  slow  in  developing  national  mechanisms  for  influencing  service \ndelivery  at  the  decentralized  level  (e.g.,  minimum  service  standards  and \nspecific  grants)  education  quality  and  enrollment  continue  to  improve,  as \ndoes public service quality at the facility level \nFulfilled.

Monetary  policy  has  been  tightened  significantly  and  the  government  announced \nsharp cuts in domestic fuel subsidies, effective October 1, to address pressures on the budget and \nthe balance of payments associated with high international prices. Breaking a policy of gradual and \nmodest rate increases, BI raised its one-month policy rate by 125 basis points to 10 percent in late \nAugust/early September and by an additional 100 basis points in early October. The last hike came \nafter the sharp increases on October 1 in domestic fuel prices\u201488 percent on gasoline, 200 percent \non  kerosene,  and  185  percent  on  diesel.  The  fuel  price  increase  was  accompanied  by  a \ncompensation package, whereby 15\u00bd million families will receive about US$120 annually to help \noffset the impact of rising fuel costs on their income. Markets have reacted positively to the interest \nrate and domestic fuel price increases, and both the rupiah and the stock market have strengthened \nsince.  \n\n\u2022  The  macroeconomic  situation  is  weaker  but  the  outlook  for  growth  is  still  favorable.  Real  GDP \ngrew  by  5.1  percent  in  2004  and  is  envisaged  to  increase  by  5\u20135\u00bd  percent  in  2005.  This  pace  is \nsomewhat  slower  than  the  6  percent  growth  registered  earlier  this  year,  reflecting  the  impact  of  the \nrecent  financial  market  volatility  on  consumer  and  investment  spending,  as  well  as  higher  oil  prices. \nInflation is expected to remain in the double digits in the near-term, following the big jump in October \nto 18 percent (year-on-year) that largely reflected the impact of domestic fuel price increases but also a \nmore  general  pickup  in  price  pressures.    To  contain  underlying  inflation,  BI  raised  its  policy  interest \nrate by another 125 basis points on November 1, and stated its commitment to take further action, as \nneeded, so as to bring inflation back down to single digits by the end of 2006.   \n\n\u2022  Fiscal policy remains prudent and the revised 2005 budget deficit target of about one percent of \nGDP  is  achievable.  The  revised  2005  budget  approved  by  parliament  in  September  entailed  a  slight \nincrease in the deficit target by 0.1 percent of GDP to 0.9 percent of GDP (1.3 percent of GDP under \nIMF  definitions).  With  fuel  subsidy  payments  this  year  now  expected  to  reach  just  over  3 percent  of \nGDP,  compared  with  over  4  percent  estimated  prior  to  the  hike  and  given  the  slower-than-expected \npace of capital expenditures so far, the deficit target should be met. The 2006 revised budget, reflecting \nmore  updated  macroeconomic  developments,  including  the  cut  in  domestic  fuel  subsidies,  was  just \napproved  by  Parliament.  The  deficit  target  has  been  kept  at  0.7  percent  of  GDP  in  line  with  the \nauthorities  commitment  of  continued  fiscal  consolidation  and  a  further  reduction  in  the  public  debt \nburden. \n\n\u2022  The  international  reserve  position  is  expected  to  recover  again  over  the  medium  term.  Gross \ninternational  reserves,  although  adequate  in  terms  of  short-term  debt  at  about  130  percent  of  GDP, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n55 \n\ncurrently  stand  at  $32  billion,  down  from  their  peak  of  $37  billion  in  early  April.  The  increase  in \ndomestic  fuel  prices  combined  with  tighter  monetary  conditions  should  help  reduce  pressures  on  the \nbalance  of  payments  that  had  emerged  over  the  course  of  the  year,  leading  to  significant  losses  in \nforeign official reserves. That said, the current account surplus is expected to narrow further over the \nmedium term as imports rise faster than exports, financed in large part by private sector capital inflows.  \n\n\u2022  The  overall  performance  of  the  banking  sector  has  improved,  but  risks  remain.  In  recent  years, \nbanks were able to improve earnings as net interest margins improved due to lower interest rates. Asset \nquality has also improved at several banks, although some banks recently showed higher NPLs due to \nstricter classification rules enforced by BI. Going forward, rising interest rates will increase credit and \ninterest rate risks, and squeeze profit margins. \n\n\u2022  The authorities have continued to implement their structural reform program but faster progress \nis needed. The government is taking a number of steps to improve the private investment climate and \nreduce  the  high  cost  of  doing  business,  including  by  streamlining  procedures  for  new  investment. \nRecent prosecution of a number of high level corruption cases, including at state banks, has signaled the \ngovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  improve  governance.  However,  the  operating  agreement  between \nPertamina and ExxonMobil, which will help boost oil production, is yet to be completed. Progress has \nalso been limited in the areas of  revenue administration, labor market reforms,  and judicial and legal \nsystems.  \n\nChallenges Ahead \n\n \n\n\u2022  Recent events illustrate that vulnerabilities remain, and appropriate and timely policies will be critical \nto  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  achieve  the  economic  objectives  of  high  growth  and \nreduced  unemployment  and  poverty.  The  immediate  policy  priority  for  the  authorities  is  maintaining \nmarket  confidence  through  careful  monitoring  of  inflation  developments  and  firm  monetary \nrestraint  to  contain  the  risk  that  the  recent  fuel  price  increase  lead  to  a  generalized  surge  in \nunderlying  inflation,  while  implementing  effectively  the  fuel  price  compensation  scheme  for  the \npoor. These actions will help to ensure that the fall-out from the volatility in financial markets in \nearlier  months  does  not  jeopardize  the  achievement  of  the  authorities\u2019  objectives  of  high  and \nsustained  growth  and  low  unemployment  and  poverty.  Assuming  that  fiscal  and  monetary  policy \nremain  prudent  and  progress  continues  to  be  made  on  structural  reforms  to  improve  the  investment \nclimate, we believe that the authorities can achieve their broad economic objectives.  \n\n \nStatus of IMF Relations \n \n\u2022 \n\nIndonesia\u2019s Extended Arrangement with the Fund ended in December 2003 and since then the Fund has \nremained in a close policy dialogue with the authorities through post-program monitoring (PPM) and \nextensive technical assistance activities.  \n\n\u2022  The  2005  Article  IV  consultation  and  third  PPM  were  completed  on  July  18.  A  data  ROSC  by  the \n\nStatistics Department was also completed in July. \n\n\u2022  The next PPM mission is scheduled for early December, and technical assistance missions from Fiscal \nAffairs  Department,  the  Monetary  and  Financial  Systems  Department,  and  the  Statistics  Department \nwill be in the field during November\u2013February. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nCore Policy Areas \nin the Development \nPolicy Support \nProgram  \nI.

A \ncontinued  reduction  in  debt-gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  ratios  will  contribute  to  reducing  risk  spreads \nand restoring yield curves. Nevertheless, the structure \nof  debt  and  contingent  liabilities  continue  to  imply \nrisks. A depreciation in the rupiah and/or an increase \nin  domestic  interest  rates  could  raise  debt  payments \nsubstantially.  However,  implicit  and  explicit  liabilities  may  pose  greater  risks,  including  state \nenterprise debts, pension, and future subsovereign borrowing. \n \n\nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nThailanda\nGDP = gross domestic product. \na  2003 data. \nSource: World Bank estimates. \n\n52% \n48% \n72%  \n49% \n\nDebt \n\nTable A6.2: Indonesia: Central Government Debt (Rp trillion) \n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2001 \n\n2000 \n\n2004 \n\nDomestic \n    \nExternal \n \nTotal  \nDebt to GDP \n\n653.8 \n47% \n613.2 \n44% \n1,267.0 \n91% \n\n647.2 \n38% \n627.1 \n37% \n1,274.2 \n76% \n\n650.7 \n35% \n587.1 \n32% \n1,237.8 \n66% \n\n616.6 \n30% \n598.2 \n29% \n1,214.8 \n59% \n\n630.5 \n27% \n660.3 \n29% \n1,290.9 \n56% \n\nGDP = gross domestic product \nNote: Nominal outstanding, exchange rate as of end of year.

The  strategy, \ncovering  2005\u20132009,  defines  the  scope  for  debt  management,  and  focuses  on  the  main  risks, \nincluding exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and rollover risk.

Corruption and public perception of corruption are discussed openly by the public \nand  the  media.  Combating  corruption  is  a  priority  under  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJM).  This  appendix  outlines  recent  progress  and  the  challenges  that \nIndonesia faces in enhancing governance and combating corruption. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nPolitical  Accountability.  2004  was  a  landmark  year  in  Indonesia\u2019s  political  history  in \nenhancing  electoral  accountability.  The  first  direct  presidential  elections  were  held.  The  legal \nframework  was  amended  to  allow  for  direct  elections  of  district  heads  and  provincial  governors; \nand  such  elections  are  under  way  for  governors,  regents,  and  mayors.  As  a  testimony  to \ndemocracy and electoral accountability, in the first five cases of elections of governors, only one \nof  the  incumbent  governors  was  elected.  While  money,  politics,  and  corruption  in  candidate \nselection cannot be removed in the short term, efforts and legal reforms to improve governance \nare clearly moving in the right direction.  \n \n3. \nCombating  Corruption.  In  the  first  few  months  after  the  direct  election  in  2004,  the \nPresident  consistently  discussed  anticorruption  and  encouraged  the  relevant  law  enforcement \nagencies to pursue several high-profile cases. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has \nbecome  a  powerful  institution.  This  and  other  new  institutional  measures  against  corruption, \nincluding  the  establishment  of  the  Anticorruption  Court,  have  begun  to  show  promising  results. \nThe  KPK  is  currently  handling  26  cases,  with  15  at  the  initial  exploratory  stage,  6  at  the \ninvestigation  stage,  and  the  remaining  5  being  prosecuted.  These  range  from  investigations  of \ncorruption  of  the  national  Government,  regional  government  institutions,  and  Parliamentary \nbodies. Some of the recent outcomes include  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nconvictions  in  the  graft  cases  against  the  governor  of  Aceh  involving  the \nprocurement of a helicopter from the Russian Federation, leading to a 10-year jail \nsentence, Rp500 million in fines, and Rp6.6 billion in restitution;  \nsentencing  of  the  acting  secretary  general  of  the  General  Election  Commission \n(KPU) and a member of the KPU to 30-month jail terms for various malpractices in \nconducting elections; \nlaunching of investigations on alleged malpractices at the top leadership levels in \nBank Mandiri, the largest state-owned bank;  \nlaunching  of  a  sting  operation  in  the  Supreme  Court,  revealing  that  court  officials \nand judges may have taken bribes of $1.6 million; the KPK has been impartial and \nrecently  interrogated  senior  officials,  notably  the  chief  justice  of  the  Supreme \nCourt; and \nresolving and now prosecuting several cases involving senior national Government \ncivil servants at the Anticorruption Court. \n\n \nDesigned  on  the  Supreme  Court  reform  blueprints,  the  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office  has \n4. \nengaged  civil  society  in  formulating  its  own  blueprint  for  reform.  The  office  has  set  up  an \nanticorruption team that is making progress on a number of high-profile cases, and is considering \nreopening  some  of  the  high-profile  bank  fraud  cases  dating  back  to  the  crisis.  These  recent \noutcomes demonstrate a clear change in the office\u2019s willingness to deal with vested interests from \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nKey Challenges \n\nthe post-crisis period, as diagnosed in comprehensive audit of the office\u2019s practices supported by \nADB in 2002.1  \n \n5. \nAs an integral part of judicial reforms, the independent Judicial Commission was recently \nestablished as a key constituent of the justice system. The commission will play a balancing role \nand  offset  the  constitutional  imbalances  in  institutional  accountability  that  resulted  from  the \nintroduction  of  the  Supreme  Court-centered  system  in  2004.  The  commission  will  advise  the \nSupreme  Court  on  applying  sanctions  in  an  independent  manner.  While  its  personnel  and \noperations  need  to  be  strengthened,  the  commission  is  expected  to  play  a  critical  role  in  the \nSupreme Court corruption case being investigated by KPK. \n \n6. \nProgress  in  fighting  corruption  is  also  being  made  by  the  local  governments,  in  the \nissuance  of  various  licenses  and  permits.  KPU  is  closely  monitoring  the  ongoing  elections,  with \nKPK functioning as a public watchdog.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nWhile  significant  progress  has  been  made,  particularly  in  the  last  one  year,  much  work \nremains in investigating corruption as well as curbing opportunities for systemic and institutional \ncorruption. Some key challenges are outlined here. \n \n8. \nFunding.  While  the  Anticorruption  Court  has  been  fairly  successful,  its  ad-hoc  judges \nhave worked for several months without being paid. Other Government internal control agencies \ngenerally complain about lack of resources and facilities.  Adequacy of support should be ensured \nto reinforce the Government\u2019s commitment to anticorruption. \n \n9. \nStructural Change. The Supreme Court reform process points to the need for structural \nchange. The reform blueprints finalized and launched in 2003 received considerable attention and \nfunding.  Yet,  structural  changes  in  the  Supreme  Court\u2019s  operation,  organization,  and  personnel \nsystems have been slow, stalling real progress.  \n \n10. \nCivil Service Reforms. Indonesia has not yet undertaken any serious attempt to reform \nits civil service, particularly at the national level. As in many other policy areas, intergovernmental \ncoordination remains weak in the area of civil service reforms. A large number of agencies share \noverlapping  and  unclear  responsibilities  for  managing  the  national  and  regional  civil  services, \nincluding the National Civil Service Agency, State Ministry for State Apparatus Reforms, Ministry \nof  Home  Affairs,  National  Institute  of  Public  Administration,  Ministry  of  Finance,  sectoral \nministries,  and  regional  governments.  Given  the  plethora  of  institutions,  the  lack  of  tangible \nprogress  is  not  surprising.  While  some  local  governments  have  shown  commitment  and  taken \ninitiatives,  these  have  been  scuttled  by  the  central  institutions  due  to  lack  of  coordination  and \nconcerns regarding possible financial liabilities involved in large-scale reforms. \n \n11. \nKPK  has  proposed  to  the  President  that  a  modernization  team  should  be  established  in \nthe President\u2019s Office to strategize and manage civil service reforms. ADB, the World Bank, and \nGerman  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  have  supported  KPK  in  developing  proposals  for \nvarious civil service reform strategies and sequencing. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n65 \n\nFIDUCIARY ASSESSMENT \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  World  Bank,  along  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Australian  Agency  for \n1. \nInternational Development and International Monetary Fund (IMF), has undertaken this fiduciary \nassessment  for  the  second  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL-2)  and  the  proposed  Development \nPolicy  Support  Program  (DPSP).  The  2001  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment \nhighlighted a number of deficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s public financial management system. The key \nconcerns  were  (i)  an  outdated  legal  environment  for  public  financial  management  (PFM);  (ii)  an \nopaque  and  inefficient  budget  formulation  process,  including  the  separation  of  recurrent  and \ndevelopment budgets; (iii) an inefficient payments system and weak monitoring arrangements; (iv) \nfragmented cash management and government banking arrangements; (v) unreliable accounting \nand reporting systems; (vi) inadequate auditing of government sectors; and (vii) overlaps between \nexternal and internal audit agencies, reflecting unclear roles and responsibilities. \n \n2. \nTo address these constraints, in 2002 the Government embarked on a PFM modernization \nprogram,  initiating  the  drafting  of  the  state  finance,  treasury,  and  audit  laws.  Following  their \nadoption in 2003\u20132004, it initiated the implementation of the World Bank-supported Government \nFinancial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration  Project  (GFMRAP)  in  June  2004  and  the \nADB-supported  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (STAR)  in  December  2004. \nThese two initiatives together provide a road map for PFM, building on earlier Government work.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \n \n\nPublic Financial Management Reforms \n\nKey PFM reforms include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe Law on State Finances (2003) provides for the basic fiscal framework, based \non international classification standards for developing the budget, a clear budget \ntimetable,  and  reporting  requirements  to  Parliament.  Under  the  law,  development \nand  recurrent  budgets  will  be  unified,  and  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework \nsystem and performance-based budgeting introduced. \nThe  National  Development  Planning  System  Law  (2004)  provides  the  legal  basis \nfor  the  national  development  planning  process,  and  for  linking  planning  with \nbudgeting. \nThe  State  Treasury  Law  (2004)  outlines  the  basis  for  modernizing  budget \nexecution  and  reporting.  Treasury  reforms  being  undertaken  include  steps  to \nrationalize  the  current  proliferation  of  Government  bank  accounts;  to  centralize \ncash  management,  and  simplify  and  speed  up  the  payments  system;  and  to \nimprove  reporting  on  budget  execution.  Government  financial  reporting  will  be \nimproved  through  the  implementation  of  Government  accounting  standards  on  a \nmodified accrual basis, but with an eventual move to full accrual accounting.  \nThe State Audit Law (2004) lays out the broad legal framework for operation of the \ncountry\u2019s supreme audit institution, BPK, to reinforce its position and mandate as \nthe independent external audit institution reporting to Parliament.  \nThe  Presidential  decree  on  Procurement \nintroduces  many \nimprovements in the procurement regime and lays out a timetable for establishing \na national policy formulation and oversight agency. An omnibus procurement law is \nenvisaged for consolidating, clarifying, and simplifying the numerous procurement \nrules and regulations. \n\n(No.80/2003) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n4. \nSeveral regulations have been adopted and/or are being drafted under these laws to guide \nthe Government work plan and budget, budget execution, special purpose agencies, Government \naccounting standards, procurement, onlending, cash management, grants and emergency funds, \nmedium-term expenditure framework, and Government auditing standards. \n \n5. \nTo  effectively  implement  the  new  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  the  Government \nrestructured  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  in  2004,  leading  to  the  establishment  of  a  new \ndirectorate general (DG) for budget and fiscal balance and a new DG for treasury, broadly in line \nwith  previous  IMF  recommendations.  All  directors  general  and  directors  have  been  appointed. \nBoth  the  budget  and  treasury  functions  have  been  strengthened;  the  director  general,  treasury, \noversees  all  treasury  functions  including  cash  and  debt  management,  fixed  asset  management, \nand government fiscal reporting. A description of the key steps taken follows. \n \n \n \nDevelopment  of  annual  budgets  through  adoption  of  (i)  the  new  economic  and  fiscal \n6. \nframework  (including  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  to  be  prepared  on  a  3-year  rolling \nbasis), (ii) clearer expenditure classification, including the integration of routine and development \nbudgets;  and  (iii)  enhanced  ex  post  fiscal  reporting  through  the  provision  of  comprehensive \nfinancial  statements,  including  a  balance  sheet,  cash-flow  statement,  and  the  budget  execution \nreport to Parliament within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. \n \n7. \nwith budgets, and clarifying the respective roles of planning and budgeting functions. \n \n8. \n \n\nPlanning and budgeting functions are integrated by formally linking ministerial work plans \n\nThe following changes are incorporated in the 2005 budget: \n\nBudget Reforms \n\na. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA new functional and program classification, consistent with the IMF Government \nFinancial  Statistics  Manual  (GFSM)  2001,  is  used  for  cash-based  transactions. \nThis  requires  review  to  ensure  it  adequately  allows  program  management  and \nperformance budgeting approaches at the agency level.  \nForward  estimates  were  introduced  for  the  first  time,  although  much  more  work \nneeds to be done to fully adopt the medium-term expenditure framework approach. \nInternational  advisers  wrote  an  extensive  number  of  papers  and  provided \npresentations  to  explain  the  concept.  The  work  plan  regulations  provide  for \nindicative  budget  ceilings  to  be  issued  for  2  years,  but  in  the  2005  and  2006 \nbudgets indicative ceilings are issued only for the forthcoming budget year.  \nRecurrent and development budgets are unified, with components from the former \ndevelopment budget classified into economic categories. \nLimited  progress  has  been  made  in  developing  a  performance-oriented  budget. \nAlthough  a  start  has  been  made  with  the  fiscal  2005  budget,  full  implementation \nwill  take  more  time  as  understanding  seems  to  be  limited,  and  no  clear  strategy \nhas yet been developed to operationalize performance orientation.  \n\nb. \n\nTreasury Reforms \n\n \n9. \nBudget  Execution  and  Public  Resource  Management.  The  new  legal  framework  will \nallow  the  Government  to  manage  its  financial  assets,  debt,  and  cash  more  efficiently  and \neffectively.  The  MOF  reorganization  will  strengthen  accountability,  eliminate  overlap  and \nduplication  of  functions,  and  enable  MOF  to  focus  more  effectively  on  its  core  functions.  The \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n67 \n\ncomplementary  ongoing  reengineering  of  business  processes  is  envisaged  to  introduce  checks \nand balances, and diminish the potential for rent-seeking that characterized virtually all stages of \nbudget formulation and execution. \n \nRationalization of the Treasury System. The new Directorate General (DG) of Treasury \n10. \nwas established under the MOF reorganization. Regional accounting offices and local verification \noffices  have  been  merged  with  regional  administrative  offices  under  the  DG  treasury,  with \ntreasury  payment  and  accounting  field  offices  (KPPNs)  coming  under  regional  administrative \noffices. However progress in simplifying payments processing has been somewhat limited. While \nMOF staff have been trained, this has not yet extended to spending ministry staff, who thus lack \nawareness of the proposed changes. New processing procedures have yet to be fully developed \nand  tested.  The  shortcomings  in  the  implementation  arrangements  for  these  changes  are \nreflected  in  the  chronic  government-wide  delays  experienced  in  the  issue  of  authorization \ndocuments by the Treasury Department of Budget this year.  \n \n11. \nThe  planned  introduction  of  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA)  and  automation  of  the \ntreasury  payment  system  are  key  reforms.  Progress  in  this  area  has  been  slow,  although  a \ndetailed work plan has now been developed, especially for establishing the TSA, which involves \nthe  progressive  rationalization  of  a  vast  number  of  separate  government  bank  accounts. \nSubstantial idle cash balances continue.  \n \n12. \nIn  the  area  of  fiscal  reporting,  the  State  Treasury  Law  requirement  for  the  complete \nintroduction of accrual accounting by 2008 is very ambitious. The transition to the accruals-based \nGFSM 2001 needs to be gradual, recognizing its dependence on an operational TSA, a double-\nentry ledger system allowing for the regular reconciliation of accounting and bank information, and \nthe  new  state  treasury  and  budget  system.  The  latest  annual  Government-wide  financial \nstatements for 2003, which include a balance sheet as well as a budget execution statement, are \nof  doubtful  quality,  reflecting  inadequate  information  on  financial  assets  (including  cash)  and \nliabilities,  lack  of  other  accruals-based  information,  failure  to  fully  reconcile  banking  and \naccounting  information  from  line  ministries,  and  shortcomings  in  accounting  skills  in  the  line \nministries.   \n \nDevelopment  and  Adoption  of  Government  Accounting  Standards.  The  Accounting \n13. \nStandards  Committee,  which  has  been  in  operation  for  a  few  years,  has  put  in  place  a  due \nprocess  for  the  development  of  Government  accounting  standards  that  are  well  aligned  with \ncomparable  international  standards.  An  initial  set  of  11  government  accounting  standards  have \nbeen formally adopted through a Presidential decree (No. 25/2005). These standards are based \non  a  modified  accrual  approach  and  cover  a  budget  implementation  report,  overall  cash-flow \nstatement, and supplementary information on various assets and liabilities to be elaborated in a \nbalance  sheet.  Each  ministry  and  agency  is  required  to  prepare  a  financial  accountability \nstatement, based on these standards. Implementing these new standards across government will \nrequire extensive training and some reengineering of related business processes in line ministries \nand agencies. This task will impose challenges, given the inherently weak capacities in ministries.   \n \n \n \n14. \nThe  Supreme  Audit  Institution.  The  new  Audit  Law  strengthens  the  role  of  BPK  and \nclarifies its role across all three levels of government. BPK has independence in determining the \nscope  of  audits.  It  can  audit  all  government  entities  and  operations  as  it  deems  appropriate.  In \naddition, public disclosure of all BPK audit reports is now mandatory. Overlap and duplication on \naudit mandates between BPK and the State Audit and Inspection Agency (BPKP) and inspectors \n\nAudit Issues \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ngeneral need to be resolved satisfactorily. In the past, BPK received technical assistance under a \nWorld Bank-financed project that closed in 2004. More attention is required to improve the BPK \nresources  and  capacity.  BPKP\u2019s  national  and  subnational  mandate  has  diminished,  and  its \nrelationship  with  BPK  remains  unclear.  Overall,  audit  arrangements  remain  weak  and  ADB\u2019s \nSTAR  Program  is  under  implementation  to  help  strengthen  internal  and  external  audit  capacity \nand clarify relative responsibilities.  \n \nC. \n \n15. \n \n\nTo ensure a sound fiduciary environment in the country, reforms will be needed for \n\nFuture Public Financial Management Reforms  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthrough \n\nthe  establishment  of  a  national \n\nincreasing  integrity  and  effective  execution  of  public  expenditures  through  the \nissuance  and  implementation  of  regulations  for  the  state  finances,  treasury,  and \naudit  laws;  establishing  a  treasury  single  account;  and  automating  the  treasury \npayments system; \nstreamlining  public  procurement \nprocurement policy office; \nstrengthening  public  expenditure  oversight  by  enhancing  the  capacity  of  BPK, \nstrengthening legislative capacity for oversight of budget execution, and eliminating \nthe overlap in internal audit entities\u2019 mandates; \nthrough \nincreasing \ngovernance-  and  accountability-enhancing  reforms  for  the  tax  and  customs \nadministrations; \nimplementing  a  government  financial  management  information  system  and \nsuccessfully implementing Government accounting standards; and \nundertaking complementary reforms outlined above in this assessment. \n\nrevenue  collection  and  eliminating \n\nrevenue \n\nleakage \n\na. \n\nIntegrating Off-Budget Operations into the Budget  \n\nb.  \n\nImproving Fiscal Reporting by Subnational Governments \n\n \n16. \nBudgets  are  still  not  comprehensive,  in  that  the  full  extent  and  magnitude  of  off-budget \noperations  are  not  known  in  several  institutions.  A  first  step  will  be  for  MOF  through  the  DG \nBudget  to  establish  an  inventory  of  these  institutions  and  then  develop  a  phased  plan  for  their \nintegration into the consolidated budget.  \n \n \n \nSubnational  governments  now  account  for  about  one  third  of  total  fiscal  activity.  Three \n17. \nproblems  prevent  MOF  from  compiling  adequate  consolidated  fiscal  reports  on  subnational \ngovernments:  they  do  not  in  all  cases  provide  the  required  information  (their  approved  budgets \nand  quarterly  budget  execution  reports)  to  MOF  (and  spending  ministries);  what  information  is \nprovided  is  often  of  poor  quality;  and  two  separate  and  different  reporting  requirements  are \nrequired,  promulgated  by  MOF  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  respectively.  The  reporting \nrequirements need to be rationalized and mechanisms for enforcement developed.  \n \n \n \n18. \nBPK  is  conducting  a  special  program  of  state-owned  enterprises.  However,  MOF  and \nrelevant sector ministries need a systematic approach to ensure state-owned enterprises operate \nto financial and other performance targets, with reliable, timely, and transparent reporting of their \nresults. \n \n\nImproving Financial Monitoring of State-Owned Enterprises \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n69 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vii) \n\nA modernized state treasury and budget system would be the central element of financial \n19. \nmanagement and accounting operations in Indonesia. The state treasury and budget system will \naccomplish the following: \n \n\nInclude core functional requirements for budget execution, covering all aspects. \nRecord and process all state budget transactions, and incorporate aggregate data \nfrom  other  elements  of  general  Government  accounting  system  as  rapidly  as \npossible. \nRecord  all  relevant  stages  of  the  payments  and  receipts  processes  and  enable \nreports to be made on key variables, such  as commitments, funds available, bills \noutstanding,  and  payments  and  receipts  (both  cash  and  accruals  basis);  for \nindividual agencies and at various levels of aggregation. \nIncorporate  controls  on  any  specified  variables  as  necessary,  for  instance  to \nensure that commitments do not exceed available funds. \nGenerate  standard  monthly  reports  and  provide  query  facilities  to  determine  the \nbudgetary  position  of  agencies,  the  state  budget,  and  the  general  government \nbudget. \n\n(vi)  Maintain  data  according  to  the  budget  classification  for  as  many  past  years  as \n\nrequired, and allow projections of up to 3 years. \nFacilitate  reconciliation  between  treasury  system  accounts  and  banking  data  by \ngenerating  chronological  lists  of  transactions  in  a  form  comparable  to  those \ngenerated by the banks.  \n\n(viii)  Ensure  compatibility  of  the  system  with  other  systems,  such  as  those  for  tax  and \ncustoms  administrations.  The  treasury  system  will  also  support  the  budget \npreparation process. \n\n \n20. \nTo  support  these  reforms,  the  Government  has  been  implementing  the  World  Bank-\nfinanced GFMRAP and the ADB-financed STAR Program.  MOF  envisages  the  GFMRAP  as  the \numbrella  for  sequencing  PFM  and  revenue  administration  reforms,  and  for  aid  coordination.1   \nGFMRAP-I (2004\u20132008) focuses on improving PFM. It supports strengthening policy capacity in \nMOF  and  BAPPENAS,  budget  policy  and  formulation,  budget  implementation  and  treasury \nmodernization,  public  procurement  reform,  and  implementation  of  public  sector  accounting \nstandards.  It  also  pilots  activities  supportive  of  revenue  administration  reforms  (such  as  the \nestablishment of an investigations unit and making the Tax Court more transparent and efficient), \nand strengthening legislative oversight of budget formulation and execution.  \n \nThe ADB-financed STAR Program aims to strengthen the legal and institutional framework \n21. \nfor internal and external audit. It provides support for strengthening the Supreme Audit Institution \n(the  BPK)  as  well  as  for  clarifying  internal  and  external  audit  roles  and  responsibilities,  and \nstrengthening audit capacity and infrastructure for national and local governments. The executive-\nParliamentary interface will also be strengthened. \n \n22. \nPublic Sector Institutional Reform Agenda. While significant progress has been made \nin terms of first steps to improve the PFM system, a huge agenda remains. This entails significant \nchanges in processes and practices, as well as technological change.

Under  the  extended  IMF  arrangement,  Bank \nIndonesia was subject to the transitional procedures under IMF\u2019s safeguards assessment policy. \nThis  required  a  review  of  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  external  audit  mechanism,  which  was  completed  on \n15  March  2002.  The  assessment  recommended  remedial  actions  to  address  a  number  of \nvulnerabilities. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment \nof  an  independent  audit  committee  at  Bank  Indonesia  and  the  publication  of  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s \naudited  financial  statements.  Audited  financial  statements  and  related  audit  reports  for  Bank \nIndonesia were reviewed and no major concerns were raised in these reports. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nIn  the  course  of  completing  analytical  work  and  engaging  with  the  Government  on \ndeveloping the reform program, a good understanding of the financial management system in the \ncountry  has  been  developed  and  weaknesses  in  the  fiduciary  environment  identified.  These \nweaknesses  are  being  addressed  through  the  PFM  reform  program,  supported  by  the  DPL \ntriggers  as  well  as  the  GFMRAP,  the  STAR  Program,  and  other  initiatives.

Establish  by  statute  a  public  accounts  and  audit \ncommittee of the Parliament. \n\n3.  Develop  a  public  sector  accounting  and  auditing \nstream within a professional civil service. \n\nB. Reform the Government Budget System \n1.  Accelerate  progress  to  a  unified  budget  based  on \nGFS classification. \n2. Improve policy review by strengthening the political \ninput into the budget preparation process. \n\n3.  Develop  integrated  revenue  estimates  including \ncustoms,  tax,  and  other  revenues  within  a  macro \nframework. \n4. Introduce performance-based budgeting. \n\nC. Strengthen Financial Management \n\n1.  Appoint  an  Accountant  General  (AG)  within  the \nMinistry of Finance at the level of Director General. \n\nStatus \nOctober 2005 \nThe  following  laws  have  been  enacted  separately  to \nprovide  greater  clarity:  State  Finance  Law  (No. \n17/2003), State Treasury Law (No. 1/2004), and Audit \nLaw  (15/2004).  Many  implementing  regulations  for \nthese  laws  have  been  issued  and  others  are  being \nfinalized by Government with aid support. \nParliament  continues  to  use  an  existing  Budget \nCommittee. Commission IX was closest to performing \nfunctions  similar \nthat  of  a  Public  Accounts \nCommittee.  To  address  the  issue  of  weak  technical \nsupport  to  the  Budget  Committee  and  commissions, \ngrant-based  technical  assistance  of  $2  million  is \nprovided in GFMRAP-I. \nNot  yet  developed,  except  a  limited  one  for  the \nincludes \nauditing  sector.  The  GFMRAP  design \nsufficient  scope  and  flexibility  to  achieve  this.  The \nADB-supported STAR provides capacity development \nsupport in selected ministries and local governments. \n \nImplementation commenced in budget for FY 2005. \n\nto \n\nImplementation  started  in  budget  FY2003.  From \nFY2005  the  budget  process  progressively  provides \nfor  greater  political  input  into  the  budget  process. \nGFMRAP  provides  grant-based  TA  for  strengthening \nDPR capacity. \nImplementation started in budget FY2003. \n\nImplementation  started \nin  budget  FY2005,  as \nmandated under Finance Law No. 17. However, more \nwork  is  needed  to  train  line  ministries  to  fully  apply \nthese concepts. \n \n\nAs  part  of  MOF  reorganization,  a  new  DG  Treasury \nwas  created  to  oversee  accounting  and  treasury \nfunctions,  separate  from  Directorate  General  (DG) \nbudget  and  fiscal  balance.  The  accountant  general \nposition  is  in  place,  but  a  Directorate  for  Systems, \nAccounts  and  Reporting  was  created  within  the  DG \nTreasury. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nCountry Financial Accountability Assessment \nRecommendation \n2.

New  Government.  accounting  standards \nhave  been  promulgated  by  Presidential  decree. \nConsolidation  of  accounting  will  be  supported  by  the \ntreasury  modernization  component  of  the  GFMRAP-I. \nFor  the  first  time  a  consolidated  set  of  financial \nstatements  for  2004  have  been  prepared,  and  plans \ndrawn up for changes in underlying business processes \nrequired to fully implement new accounting standards. \nThe  MOF  reorganization \nincludes  shifting  greater \nresponsibility  for  financial  control  to  line  ministries;  this \ncommenced in 2005, though weak capacity in ministries \nis a constraint. \nThe  implementing  regulations  for  the  State  Treasury \nLaw will address this. Responsibility for cash and asset \nmanagement  has  been  consolidated  under  the  DG \nTreasury.   \nThis will be covered by the implementing regulations for \nthe State Treasury Law, enacted in January 2004. \nA  beginning  has  been  made  with  MOF;  the  DG \nCustoms has promulgated an ICT policy statement as a \nprecursor to a more detailed ICT strategy. The ongoing \nstate \ntreasury  and  budget  system  design  and \nimplementation  initiative  is  another  example  of  ICT \napplication driven by business needs. \nThe  design  and  implementation  of  the  state  treasury \nand  budget  system  is  the  first  step  in  the  eventual \nimplementation of an TFMIS. \nThe  public  sector  FM  reform  plan  addresses  these \nconcerns.  \n\nA  Government  accounting  standards  committee  has \nbeen in operation for a few years, and a due process for \ndeveloping standards established. A first set of 11 such \nstandards  were  set  by  Presidential  decree  24/2005. \nThese prescribe reporting standards to be followed. \nThe  public  sector  FM  reform  plan  includes  preparation \nof a Government annual report.  \n \nThe  Audit  Law  passed  in  July  2004  provides  a  clear \nmandate for BPK as the supreme audit institution. \n\nThis is provided in the new Audit Law. \n\nThis  is  not  clear  enough  in  the  Law  on  State  Audit.  A \ncomprehensive  reform  of  the  audit  sector  is  being  led \nby ADB, which will address this issue. \nBPK  has  adopted  a  strategic  development  plan,  to \nguide its development over the medium-term.   \n\nBAKUN  =  State  Accounting  Agency  (now  subsumed  under  DG  Treasury);  BPK  =  Supreme  Audit  Institution;  FY  = \nFiscal  Year,  PFM  =  public  financial  management;  GFMRAP  =  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue \nAdministration  Project;  ICT  =  information  and  communication  technology;  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  TFMIS  = \nTreasury Financial Management Information System, KPKN = State Treasury Office. \nSources: World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n73 \n\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used to finance the foreign currency expenditures for the \n\n1. \nreasonable cost of imported goods required during implementation of the Program.  \n \n2. \n \n\nNotwithstanding the provision of para. 1, no withdrawals will be made for  \n\n(i) \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  Customs  Coordination  Council \nNomenclature  chapters  or  headings  as  designated  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) by notice to the Government; \n\nGroup \n\nSubgroup \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A9: Negative List \n\n \n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n525 \n667 \n718 \n\n897 \n\n971 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n718.7 \n\n897.3 \n\n \nAlcoholic beverages  \nTobacco, unmanufactured tobacco refuse \nTobacco,  manufactured  (whether  or  not  containing  tobacco \nsubstitutes) \nRadioactive and associated materials \npearls, precious and semi-precious stones, unworked or worked \nNuclear  reactors  and  parts  thereof,  fuel  elements  (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \nJewelry of gold, silver, or platinum group metals (except watches \nand  watch  cases);  goldsmiths\u2019  or  silversmiths\u2019  wares  (including \nset gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ores and concentrates) \n\nexpenditures in the currency of the Borrower or of goods supplied from the territory \nof the Borrower; \n\npayments  made  for  expenditures  incurred  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness date of the loan; \n\nexpenditures for goods supplied under a contract that any national or international \nfinancing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  agreed  to  finance,  including \nany contract financed under any loans from ADB; \n\nexpenditures for goods intended for a military or paramilitary purpose or for luxury \nconsumption; and  \n\nexpenditures \nfor  pesticides  categorized  as  extremely  hazardous  or  highly \nhazardous  in  Class  1a  or  1b,  respectively,  of  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s \nClassification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \nX  Yes \n \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \nX Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nThe  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS)  has  five  basic  strategies  for  poverty  reduction:  (i)  broadening \nopportunities, (ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity, (iv) providing social protection, and (v) \npromoting  global  partnerships.  The  NPRS  is  to  be  implemented  through  macroeconomic  strategy  and  policies  for \nfulfilling  basic  rights,  for  promoting  gender  justice  and  equality,  and  regional  development.  The  NPRS  considers \nmacroeconomic policies as the foundation for reducing poverty through a supportive business environment and broad \nopportunities  for  increasing  the  capability  of  the  poor  through  four  related  objectives  to  (i)  create  macroeconomic \nstability,  (ii)  promote  economic  growth,  (iii)  increase  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship,  and  (iv) \nreduce inequalities between regions. The NPRS considers the willingness of central and local governments to manage \nthe  budget  in  an  open,  accountable,  efficient,  and  effective  way\u2014  an  essential  prerequisite  for  implementing  the \nNPRS. It recognizes that partnerships are necessary for implementing the NPRS with the private sector and financial \nand nonfinancial banking Institutions identified as key stakeholders.  \n \nThe country poverty assessment1 and country poverty partnership agreement2 consider macroeconomic stability as a \nfundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. Under the agreement, ADB has agreed to support the Government to \npromote  macroeconomic  stability  for  inclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Highest  priority  is  given  to  institutional \nreforms  to  achieve  transparent  and  accountable  institutions.  The  poverty  agreement  also  calls  for  expansion  and \nimprovement  of  key  basic  services  such  as  health,  education,  water  supply,  and  sanitation  through  public-private \npartnerships  and  the  need  to  expand  a  system  of  social  protection.  At  the  same  time,  the  poverty  partnership \nagreement notes the tremendous fiscal constraint facing the Government in the medium term and therefore the need \nto make the best use of existing resources.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                              Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Development Policy Support Program (DPSP) directly supports implementation of the NPRS as envisioned by the \npoverty partnership agreement. The DPSP focuses on key areas central to implementing the NPRS strategy. The core \nareas of the program are   \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nensuring macroeconomic stability,  \nimproving the investment climate,  \nimproving public financial management, and  \nensuring services work for the poor (new pillar in the forward-looking program).   \n\n \nThe  actions  under  each  of  these  core  areas  directly  correspond  to  the  NPRS  strategy  or  implementing  mechanism. \nThe links between DPSP actions and the NPRS are shown in Table A10. \n \nThe DPSP actions are essential for implementing the NPRS. In the face of limited resources, the Government cannot \nmaintain significant subsidies to the non-poor. Without the fuel price increases announced in early October 2005, the \nfuel subsidy would have accounted for about 20% of overall Government expenditures. Manageable and well-targeted \nsubsidies and a well-functioning tax system are essential components of effective and efficient management of state \nbudget and revenues. The measures adopted under the Program to reorient public expenditures to productive uses, \nsuch  as  health,  education,  and  basic  infrastructure,  will  help  alleviate  the  significant  development  constraints  and \nregional disparities faced in Indonesia. Borrowing is a significant source of development funds while onlending and on-\ngranting  from  national  to  local  governments  are  tools  for  development  spending.  Developing  a  debt  management \nstrategy  ensures  optimal  use  of  borrowing  instruments.  Lessons  learned  from  the  implementation  of  the  Ministry  of \nFinance decree KMK 35 for onlending and on-granting will provide a more efficient and effective instrument to channel \nfunds  for  regional  development  including  development  of  essential  services.    Enhanced  transparency  and \naccountability  in  state  finances  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  public  funds  are  used  as  planned,  besides  enabling  the \npublic  to  participate  in  policy  making  and  to  judge  the  performance  of  elected  officials.  Development  and \nimplementation  of  a  single  treasury  account  and  establishing  a  unit  to  investigate  fraud  will  increase  overall \naccountability.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2000.

Implementation  of  the  compensation  programs  initiated  in  March  2005  and  October  2005  by  the \nGovernment will provide additional insights. In the forward-looking program, these lessons will enable the Government \nto develop a better targeted and more transparent program to accelerate implementation of the NPRS. The DPSP also \nsupports enhance private sector participation in NPRS implementation through broad-ranging measures, by reducing \ntransaction  costs  associated  with  investments  and  removing  registration  delays  and  uncertainties.  The  DPSP  also \nsupports measures to boost confidence in the financial system, which in turn will lead to greater resource mobilization \nof  short-  and  long-term  funds.  The  DPSP\u2019s  focus  on  risk-sharing  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  will  help \nmeet the pent-up demand for infrastructure needed to provide basic services and to attract productive investments to \ngenerate  employment.  The  medium-term  action  plan  and  framework  to  coordinate  the  development  of  small-  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  will  provide  more  effective  support  to  a  key  source  of  employment  for  the  poor  and  near \npoor.    \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n   Yes \n\nX   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nNote: However, as part of the development policy loan process, consultations were held with a wide-range of \nstakeholders, including the private sector, labor groups, and enterprises. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nD. \nGender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  DPSP  has  indirect  gender  impacts  through  its  emphasis  on  making  services  work  for  the  poor.

In  addition,  higher  transportation  costs\u2014stemming \nfrom  the  reduction  of  the  other  fuel  subsidies\u2014will  result  in \nincreased  consumer  prices  for  goods  purchased  and  reduced \nproducer  prices  for  goods  sold.  As  a  result,  the  purchasing \npower  of  the  public  will  be  reduced  in  general.  The  near  poor, \nthose  with  incomes  less  than  1.2  times  the  poverty  line  may \nalso  fall  into  poverty  as  a  result  of  general  price  increases. \nNonetheless,  the  reduction  of  fuel  subsidies  provides  the \nGovernment  with  significant  opportunities  for  redirecting  public \nspending  to  the  needs  of  the  poor,  and  enhancing  overall \neconomic welfare. In particular, the large fuel subsidies created \nperverse  incentives  resulting  in  large-scale  misdirection  of \npublic  resources  and  crowded  out  productive  investments  in \nthe \ninfrastructure. \nbasic  services  and \nGovernment  raised  the  price  of  fuel  by  30%,  excluding \nkerosene.  As  a  result,  kerosene  was  diverted  for  other \npurposes,  household  kerosene  became  scarce,  and  retail \nprices  rose.  This  experience  demonstrated  there  was  no \nto  maintain  any  significant  gap  between \neffective  way \nhousehold and industry prices. The Government\u2019s Fuel Subsidy \nCash  Transfer  Scheme  covering  the  poor  and  near  poor  is \nsufficient  to  offset  the  direct  increase  in  the  price  of  kerosene. \nPoor  and  near  poor  households  consume  about  17  liters  of \nkerosene  per  month  for  cooking  and  boiling  water.  The  cash \ntransfer of Rp100,000 per month is more than sufficient to cover \nthe net increase in the price of kerosene of Rp1,400 per liter or \nRp23,800  for  17  liters.  The  balance  of  Rp76,200  is  also \nsufficient  to  cover  a  16%  increase  in  the  cost  of  other  basic \ncommodities,  a  level  that  exceeds  the  current  predictions  of \ninflation.  With  improvements  in  the  cash  transfer  system  over \ntime,  along  with  other  measures  to  increase  investments  in \nhealth,  education,  and  basic  infrastructure,  the  adverse  impact \non  the  poor  will  be  further  reduced.  On  the  basis  of  these \nfactors,  no  separate  plan  is  required  to  mitigate  the  negative \nimpact on affordability. \nThe impact on labor is positive in the near to short term through \nimprovement  in  the  investment  climate.  The  DPSP  promotes \ninvestments  in  productive  sectors,  including  infrastructure.  The \nmeasures  will  create  jobs  necessary  to  absorb  the  increasing \nnumber of unemployed. The immediate impact of general price \nincreases  generated  by  the  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies  may \nspeed  up  the  closure  of  marginal  industries.
