Two  loans,  one  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  other  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund  (ADF)  were  approved  on  20  November  2008  for  the  Avatiu  Port  Development  Project. 3 \nThe  project  will  rehabilitate  and  expand  the  capacity  of  the  port.  The  project  comprises  (i) \nwidening  the  harbor  entrance,  (ii)  dredging  to  increase  the  depth  alongside  the  wharf  plus \ndredging  and  enlarging  the  ship  turning  area,  and  (iii)  reconstructing  and  realigning  the  quay \nand repairing the adjacent wharf deck. 4  The cost of the civil works has increased as a result of \ncurrency realignment and an underestimation of input prices. A supplementary loan is therefore \nrequired to meet the increased cost of the project. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  country  is  heavily  reliant  on  international  imports  by  sea  to  support  its  tourism \nindustry\u2014the mainstay of  the  country\u2019s  economy\u2014as  well  as for general  imports  and  exports. \nThe continued efficient operation of the port, its security against periodic cyclone events, and its \ndevelopment to accommodate changes in regional shipping methods are therefore critical to the \nCook Islands\u2019 economy and the social well-being of its population. \n \nThe  wharf  is  weak,  aging,  and  vulnerable  to  damage  from  storms  and  impact  from \n4. \nvessels.  The  port  is  at  the  margin  of  safe  operations  for  international  cargo  vessels  currently \nserving the Cook Islands. Meanwhile, longer, deeper-draft, and more efficient cargo vessels are \nplanned  for  the  Pacific  islands\u2019  trade  in  the  next  few  years,  with  the  existing  vessels  being \nremoved  from  service.  The  larger  ships  cannot  be  handled  through  Avatiu  Port  at  present, \nbecause of the limited depth alongside the wharf and in the harbor, berthing length limitations, \nand  an  inadequate  turning  area  within  the  harbor.  The  length  limitation  also  prevents  larger \ncruise vessels from berthing at Avatiu Port, thus limiting the economic benefit to be gained from \nthis  part  of  the  tourism  market.  Without  the  project,  there  will  be  escalating  costs  for  periodic \nrepair of the wharf and the port\u2019s use will need to be restricted to smaller vessels. Costs will be \nhigher, and there will be adverse economic impacts.  \n \n5. \nThe harbor cannot handle ships longer than about 90 meters (m), and the berth is limited \nto a 6 m draft. That effectively excludes cargo vessels above 4,000 tons and most cruise ships, \nwhich have to transfer passengers by the ship\u2019s boats. The port has suffered periodic damage \n\n                                                \n1   Administered by ADB. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2008.

Manila (R254-08, Loans 2472-COO and 2473-COO[SF], accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA). ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Cook Islands \nfor Preparing the Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (TA 7022-COO, approved on 12 December 2007, for \n$700,000). \n\n\ffrom cyclones and emergency procedures are in place to minimize losses when cyclones occur. \nThe existing wharf was constructed in 1989. It is in a state of advanced deterioration because of \ndeficiencies in the design and poor construction. The quay face and parts of the wharf deck are \nvulnerable to sudden failure, which could be triggered by a storm or vessel impact. Such failures \nwill involve unplanned and increasingly expensive emergency repairs as the wharf continues to \ndeteriorate.  Full  reconstruction  of  the  quay  is  urgently  needed,  along  with  deepening  and \nwidening of the harbor to accommodate the next generation of cargo vessels and larger cruise \nships. Once the project is completed, at least 70% of all cruise ships that currently call  will be \nable to berth at the wharf. \n \n6. \nIn  2007,  the  government  adopted  a  20-year  Preventive  Infrastructure  Master  Plan  that \nwas  prepared  under  a  technical  assistance  (TA) from  ADB 5 as  an  integral  part  of the  National \nSustainable  Development  Plan  2007\u20132010  (NSDP). 6 The  plan  assessed  the  condition  and \nmanagement  of  existing  infrastructure,  concluding  that  lack  of  investment  in  maintenance, \nrehabilitation,  and  upgrading  has  resulted  in  aging  systems  that  do  not  provide  appropriate \nlevels  of  service  for  current  demand  and  that  this  places  sustained  economic  development  at \nrisk.  Following  the  Plan,  ADB  funded  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  preparation  of  an \ninfrastructure  development  project  with  detailed  feasibility  studies  for  a  number  of  priority \ninfrastructure investments including Avatiu port development. 7 \n \nThe  development  of  Avatiu  port  was  accorded  high  priority  because  of  the  risk  of \n7. \ncatastrophic  failure.  By  safeguarding  the  continued  efficient  operations  and  expansion  of  the \nport,  the  project  will  ensure  that  facilities  required  for  private  sector-led  economic  growth  are \nstrengthened and risks to operational efficiency are removed. \n \n8. \nthat  maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  depends  on  removing  the  binding  constraints  to  environmentally \nsustainable  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  improving  the  quality  of  public  sector \ngovernance. 8 The  strategic  focus  of  the  partnership  strategy  is  derived  from  the  NSDP  and \naddresses  these  constraints  through  improved  economic  and  social  infrastructure  and  public \nsector service delivery. This directly supports implementation of the NSDP. \n \nB. \n\nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2008\u20132012 \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nrecognizes \n\n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  continued  economic  growth  and  well-being  of  the \npopulation.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  a  secure  and  efficient  port  infrastructure  in \nRarotonga with constraints and safety risks removed. The project will enhance safety and bring \nship berthing and maneuvering within the harbor more closely into line with accepted maritime \nindustry practice.  \n \nThe  physical  outputs  of  the  project  are:  (i)  harbor  dredged  to  8  m  below  chart  datum \n10. \n(from the current depth of about 6 m), (ii) widened harbor entrance (by approximately 10 m), (iii) \ndemolition  of  the  outer  and  inner  berths  and  replacement  of  them  by  a  continuous  quay  (total \nstraight wharf face of 270 m), (iv) new sheet piling along the new quay wall, (v) rehabilitation of \nthe wharf deck back to 20 m from the wharf face, (vi) demolition of the old slip and patrol boat \n\n                                                \n5  ADB.  2006.

ADB has provided a blend of two loans totaling $15.5 million equivalent, comprising an \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  loan  of  $8.6  million  and  an  ADF  loan  of  SDR4.524  million \n($6.9  million  equivalent)  (collectively,  the  original  loans). 9 The  ADF  loan  has  a  maturity  of  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years. The OCR loan has a term of 25 years with a grace \nperiod  of  5  years.  The  original  loans  were  approved  on  20  November  2008  and  became \neffective on 10 September 2009. A subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and the \nCook Islands Ports Authority (CIPA) provides for the loan proceeds to be onlent to CIPA on the \nsame financial terms and conditions, as those of the original loans. \n \n13. \nADB  agreed to finance 85.2%  of  the total  project  cost,  including taxes and  duties,  with \nthe government funding the balance (14.8%). 10 The original cost estimates are summarized by \nfinancing source in Table 2. \n \n\n                                                \n9  SDR4.524 million is approximately $7.07 million at 28 January 2011. \n10 The  country  cost-sharing  ceiling  is  up  to  99%  for  lending  and  nonlending  products.

The  delays  were \ndue to CIPA\u2019s inexperience with ADB\u2019s processes. However, CIPA, the executing agency, has \nestablished the project office and the project management team in accordance with the original \nimplementation  plan.  Consultants  were  appointed  in  January  2010  and  detailed  design, \ntendering, and award of contract for the civil works were accomplished without further delay by \nDecember  2010. 11 No  further  procurement  actions  are  required.  The  successful  bidder  has \nprovided an accelerated construction program, which will, if achieved, result in completion of the \ncivil works by February 2012. The contractual completion date including the contractors\u2019 float 12 \nis  July  2012.  Completion  of  construction  was  originally  expected  by  April  2012,  and  therefore \nthere  is  currently  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the  original  completion  date  will  be  met. \nImplementation progress is therefore satisfactory. \n \nThe original report and recommendation of the President (the original RRP) stated that \n15. \nthe  project  will  climate-proof  the  wharf  by  replacing  the  existing  structure  that  is  extremely \nvulnerable  to  wave  action  and  associated forces  with  one  that  is fully  resistant  to such forces. \nAdditionally, the wharf will be designed so that it can be raised along with the container yard at \nsome future date, if required by a rise in sea level. Similarly, the design of the anchorage points \nfor the fendering system will allow the fenders to be set at a higher level if required. The detailed \ndesign of the works has incorporated these features and has identified the cost of doing so. A \ngrant of $0.8 million (to be administered by ADB) was provided from the Climate Change Fund \n(CCF) to meet the additional costs. 13  \n \n16. \nCIPA  has  fully  complied  with  safeguard-related  assurances.  However,  the  government \nhas  not  yet  complied  with  an  assurance  that  it  will  pay  the  cost  of  the  community  services \nprovided  by  CIPA.  Progress  in  this  regard  was  delayed  in  2010  because  of  political  instability \nthat  significantly  hampered  government  decision  making  processes.  Elections  took  place  in \nNovember  2010  and  dialogue  will  be  renewed  with  the  incoming  government  during  2011.  A \nnew deadline of 30 November 2011 for the satisfaction of these assurances has been approved \nby ADB on 4 February 2011 through a minor change in project scope. \n \n\n                                                \n11 ADB advised CIPA of its \u201cno objection\u201d to the proposed contract, which was awarded on 14 December 2010. \n12 \u201cFloat\u201d  is  the  time  that  a  contractor  allows  in  the  construction  schedule  for  unforeseen  delays.  The  total  time, \n\ninclusive of \u201cfloat\u201d is the contractual time for completion. \n\n13 Approved by the Climate Change Steering Committee on 17 February 2011. \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\nThe physical scope of the project is unchanged from that identified in the original RRP. \n17.  \nThe  cost  overrun  has  resulted \nfrom  a  combination  of  currency  movement  and  an \nunderestimation  of  the  cost  of  the  civil  works.  The  financing  plan  in  the  original  RRP  allowed \nNZ$24.2 million for civil works (at mid-2008 prices, inclusive of 27.5% contingencies). However, \nthe  accepted  bid  price  is  NZ$27.2 million,  which  is  12.4%  more  than the appraisal  estimate  in \nNew  Zealand  dollar  terms.  However,  in  US  dollar  terms,  the  civil  works  cost  has  increased \n27.8% from $16.2 million to $20.7 million. The cost estimates in the original RRP were based on \nan  exchange  rate  of  NZ$1.00  =  $0.67  whereas  the  revised  cost  estimate  is  based  on  the \nprevailing  rate  of  NZ$1.00  =  $0.76.  Fifty-five  percent  of  the  increase  (or  about  $2.4  million)  is \nattributable  to  exchange  rate  movements  and  45%  (or  about  $2.1  million)  is  attributable  to \nunderestimation of the cost. The civil works contract attracted sufficient interest for the bidding \nprocess  to  be  considered  competitive.  Twenty-three  entities  requested  prequalification \nquestionnaires, and 7 firms were prequalified. Four firms submitted bids, 2 of which were below \nthe  engineer\u2019s  updated estimate. The  reasons for  the  cost  underestimation  are  volatility  in  the \ncost  of  construction  materials,  the  relative  isolation  of  the  project  site,  and  volatile  market \nconditions. These considerations made cost estimation difficult, with the contingency allowance \nproving insufficient.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\nThe  project  comprises  a  single  civil  works  contract  that  must  be  completed  in  order  to \n18. \nachieve the development objectives. The government is committed to implementing the project \nas soon as possible. It has demonstrated its commitment by authorizing CIPA to award the civil \nworks  contract  before  the  expiry  of  the  bid  validity  period,  while  recognizing  that  additional \nfinance  will  be  required.  Potential  impacts  on  project  implementation  have  therefore  been \navoided. \n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\n19. \nThe  scope  of  works  for  the  project  is  a  least-cost  solution  to  meeting  the  future \noperational  needs  of  Avatiu  port.  The  scope  cannot  be  reduced  without  significant  loss  of \nbenefits.  The  existing  wharf  is  in  poor  condition  and  risks  catastrophic  failure.  The  overall \nrationale for upgrading the port therefore remains as described in the original RRP. \n \nD. \n\nRevised Investment and Financing Plan \n\nThe  revised  total  cost  estimate  of  the  project  is  estimated  to  be  $24.64  million.

The supplementary  loan  will  have  a  25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the \nloan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  for  the \nsupplementary loan (the Supplementary loan agreement). The supplementary loan will finance \nthe  additional  cost  of  the  civil  works,  inclusive  of  taxes  and  duties,  that  is  not  covered  by  the \noriginal loans or grants. Consideration has been given to the amount of taxes and duties, and \nthese  do  not  constitute  an  excessive  share  of  project  costs. 14 The  government  has  provided \nADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility \nbased  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made on the basis of on any communication or advice from ADB. \nTo  finance  the  climate  change  adaptation  measures,  the  CCF  has  provided  the  CCF  grant  of \n$0.80 million towards the cost of civil works (exclusive of taxes and duties). \n \nThe government will onlend the proceeds of the supplementary loan to CIPA through a \n22. \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  on  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  subsidiary  loan \nagreement shall be executed on the same financial and other terms and conditions as required \nin  the  supplementary  loan  agreement.  The  government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest rate variation risk of the loan. Similarly, the government will provide the proceeds of the \nCCF Grant to CIPA through a subsidiary grant agreement on terms and conditions acceptable \nto ADB. \n\n                                                \n14 The  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  to  be  financed  (i)  is  within  the  thresholds  identified  in  the  Cook  Islands  country \npartnership strategy 2008\u20132012, (ii) does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (iii) \nis material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n\f \n23. \n \n\nThe original and revised financing plans are in Table 4. \n\nTable 4: Original and Revised Financing Plan \n \nOriginal \nShare of Total (%)  Amount \n($ million) \n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\n \n\nRevised \nShare of Total (%) \n \n\n \nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank  \n\nADF \n\nOCR (original) \n\nOCR (supplementary) \nClimate Change Fund \n\nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n  6.88 \n\n  8.63 \n\n \n\n \n\n  2.68 \n\n18.20 \n\n 37.8 \n\n 47.4 \n\n \n\n \n\n  14.8 \n\n100.0 \n\n  6.88 \n\n  8.63 \n\n  4.70 \n\n  0.80 \n\n  3.62 \n\n24.64 \n\n  27.9 \n\n  35.0 \n\n  19.1 \n\n    3.2 \n\n  14.8 \n\n100.0 \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nNumbers may not seem precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nNet government debt is estimated to be 19.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) and is \n24. \nwell within the benchmark of 35% identified for fiscal responsibility. 15 The government reversed \nan  earlier  decision  to  borrow  NZ$37.5  million  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  but  has \nreceived a program loan with a first subprogram of $10 million from ADB, which will be used to \nfinance economic infrastructure. 16 The second sub-program of the loan from ADB, for $6 million, \nis expected in 2011.

The \nproject remains technically feasible. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n27. \nThe  project  economic  benefits  remain  as  assessed  in  Appendix  9  of  the  original  RRP. \nHowever,  because  of  the  increased  construction  cost,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \nnow estimated to be 13.9% (15.9% at the appraisal for the original loans). The net present value \nis  now  estimated  to  be  $2.12  million  ($5.49  million  at  appraisal).  In  terms  of  financial \nsustainability,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  reduced  from  6%  to  4.2%.  However,  the \nweighted average cost of capital is 0.58% because interest rates are lower than at appraisal and \nbecause of the grant financing element from the CCF. The project remains economically viable \nand financially sound. \n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and CIPA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n\nThe  project  is  category  B,  B,  and  C  for  environment,  resettlement,  and  indigenous \n29. \npeoples,  respectively.    As  the  supplementary  loan  does  not  involve  a  change  in  scope,  the \ncategorizations  are  unchanged  from  those  determined  for  the  original  loans.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (including an environmental management plan) has been prepared \nfor  the  project  and  is  available  as  a  supplementary  appendix  to  the  original  RRP.  The  current \ndesign  and \nthe  project  meets  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) \nrequirements for the CCF-funded activities, and the range of any additional potential impact that \n\nimplementation  of \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fcould  occur  due  to  the  CCF-funded  activities  can  be  adequately  addressed  by  the  project\u2019s \nexisting environment management plan. \n\n \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the original RRP. Financial \nrisks were identified as the management effectiveness and financial control exercised by CIPA \nover its port operating costs, as well as  in setting levels of port charges to adequately recover \nthese  costs  and  to  meet  CIPA\u2019s  debt  service  and  government  dividend  obligations.  Since \nappraisal  for  the  original  loans,  CIPA  has  increased  its  operating  revenues  (for  both  FY2009 \nand  FY2010)  through  efficiency  improvements  and  a  10%  increase  in  port  charges, \nnotwithstanding a downturn in shipping volumes. The downturn was due to (i) global economic \nconditions  during  FY2008  through  FY2010,  and  (ii)  the  loss  of  scheduled  visits  by  Forum \nShipping Line. In the latter case, Pacific Direct Line resumed the Forum schedule in April 2010. \nGDP is expected to grow by 2.9% in FY2011, 9.1% in FY2012, and 7.4% in FY2013, reflecting \ngrowth  in  real  GDP  and  inflation.  Significant  growth  is  forecast  to  result  from  the  adoption  of \naggressive  marketing  for  tourism,  including  the  expansion  of  air  services,  though  underlying \ngrowth  will  be  dependent  on  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  global  economy  (footnote  15).  Rapid \nexpansion of tourism is expected to result in significantly increased demand for cargo services. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n31. \nThe  government  and  CIPA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n32. \nThe government and CIPA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich  are  set  forth  in  the  supplementary  loan  agreement,  the  grant  agreement,  and  the \namended project agreement. \n \n33. \nIn addition to the standard conditions for effectiveness, the following conditions apply (i) \nthe subsidiary loan agreement for the supplementary loan, satisfactory to ADB, shall have been \nduly  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of  the  government  and  CIPA  and  shall  have  become \nlegally binding upon the government and CIPA; and (ii) the subsidiary grant agreement for the \nCCF grant,  satisfactory to  ADB,  shall  have  been  duly  executed and  delivered  on  behalf of  the \ngovernment and CIPA and shall have become legally binding upon the government and CIPA.  \n \n34. \nallocated for works under the original loans have been fully disbursed. \n \n35. \nNo  disbursements  shall  be  made  from  the  CCF  grant  until  the  project\u2019s  supervising \nengineer has certified that the project described in schedule 1 to the grant agreement has been \nconstructed to his satisfaction and has certified payment to the contractor. \n \n\nNo  withdrawals  shall  be  made  under  the  supplementary  loan  until  the  loan  proceeds \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n36. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $4,700,000  to  the  Cook  Islands  for  the  Avatiu  Port  Development \nProject from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, with  interest to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft  supplementary  loan  and  amended  project  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard;
