THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Emergency Assistance for Fighting the COVID-19 \nPandemic. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nGovernment of Norway, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The emergency project was prepared in response to the Government of Pakistan\u2019s \nrequest to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 25 March 2020 for assistance in managing the \noutbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Pakistan. The project will help the government \ndeal with the crisis quickly and flexibly by providing immediate financing to (i) strengthen its public \nhealth  preparedness  and  responsiveness;  and  (ii)  a  social  protection  component for  quick \nfinancial support to help meet the basic needs of vulnerable and poor segments of society. The \nproject is part of ADB\u2019s response of supporting developing member countries in their fight against \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and was designed in close coordination and cooperation with the World \nBank. \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \nCOVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and \na pandemic on 11 March 2020.1 Pakistan is highly susceptible to the spread of COVID-19 given \nthat it borders the Islamic Republic of  Iran and the People\u2019s Republic of China, which were among \nthe initial countries experiencing the COVID-19 epidemic. Pakistan also has large numbers of \nreturning migrant workers, an overcrowded public transportation system, an underfinanced and \nweak health system, and densely populated urban and peri-urban settlements. Its incidence of \nCOVID-19 infections is quickly rising\u2014from the first two cases and no deaths recorded on \n26 February 2020 to 29,465 cases and 639 deaths by 10 May 2020.2 The number of new daily \ncases reached the 1,000 mark in May 2020, and more than 376 health workers (including \n181 doctors) became part of the overall case load. \n \n4.  Public health impacts of the pandemic on Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan has \nhistorically underfinanced the health sector, and the country\u2019s health expenditures accounted for \nless than 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) for decades.3 Consequently, Pakistan lacks basic \nmedical  infrastructure  with  0.6  hospital  beds  per  1,000  people,  compared  with  WHO's \nrecommended standard of 5 beds per 1,000 people. It also falls short of WHO's recommended \nthreshold of 23 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 10,000 people\u2014its ratio is 12 to 10,000.4 \nPakistan is not well prepared for a pandemic based on the latest WHO State Parties Self-\nAssessment Annual Reporting, which assessed the country\u2019s International Health Regulations \nCore Capacities and rated the technical areas of \u201cnational health emergency framework\u201d as 2 on \na scale of 1 (no capacity) to 5 (sustainable capacity), \u201chealth service provision\u201d as 2, and \u201crisk \ncommunication\u201d as 1.5 \n \n1  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 (accessed on 5 May 2020). \n2  WHO.

These limitations make the government\u2019s efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 even \nmore challenging. A boost to the health system is required to increase access to health services \nand improve the quality of service delivery; strengthen policy and governance frameworks, and \nadopt minimum delivery standards for infection prevention and control measures; and enable the \nimplementation of  the Pakistan Preparedness and Response Plan (PPRP) to combat COVID-19. \nThe PPRP was prepared by the government and the United Nations (UN) country team, with \nsupport from key development partners, to control the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the related \nmorbidity and mortality.6 The PPRP\u2019s predicative analysis of expected cases based on the \ninfection rates in other countries indicates that Pakistan is likely to experience about 200,000 \npositive cases, of which 80% are expected to be mild, 15% moderate to severe, and about 5% \ncritical; critical cases will require ventilation and highly specialized support.7  \n \n6.  Socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected \na sharp decline in the GDP growth rate for Pakistan, from 3.3% in FY2019 to \u20131.5% in FY2020.8 \nThis downward revision of about 4% by the IMF for FY2020 is due primarily to the decline in \nconsumption, investment, trade, remittances, and capital flows as the result of the COVID-19 \noutbreak. ADB projected that the COVID-19 outbreak is expected to cause sharp declines in \ndomestic demand, curb tourism and business travel, affecting trade and production links, and \ncausing supply disruptions.9 The immediate challenge for the government will be to contain the \nspread of the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize economic losses, as well as protect the social \nand economic wellbeing of the affected and vulnerable population.  \n \n7.  Poverty and human development impacts of COVID-19. Despite substantial reductions \nin poverty rates during 2001\u20132015, 24.3% of Pakistan\u2019s population lives below the national \npoverty line\u201431% in rural areas and 13% in urban areas.10 In addition to the 24.3% of people \nliving below the poverty line, a further 10% are near-poor and highly vulnerable to economic and \nhealth shocks connected with the COVID-19 response, which could push them below the poverty \nline. By regional standards, stunting and wasting of children remain high,11 and women's literacy \nrates and access to finance are also still low.12 Women are more susceptible and highly vulnerable \nto economic shocks such as those triggered by COVID-19 because of disruptions in income and \neducation, poor access to health and other essential services, and gender pay gaps. \n \n8.  Needs assessment. The PPRP identifies gaps and provides a granular roadmap to meet \nthe  critical  health  sector  needs,  including  equipment,  beds,  testing  kits,  human  resource, \ncoordination, monitoring and all the specialized facilities required. This plan requires about $595 \nmillion for the 9 months from April to December 2020 and is structured on the WHO-COVID-19 \nStrategic Preparedness and Response Plan Guidelines.13 The emphasis of PPRP is on a well-\ncoordinated delivery, leveraging community networks and engaging existing public health experts \nand facilities with essential augmentation where required. \n \n6 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination. 2020.

While the health shock can be transitory, the economic damage could persist without \npreventive and recovery measures.14 The poverty rate in Pakistan fell from 64.3% in 2001 to \n24.3% in 2015, lifting more than 23 million people out of poverty. This was made possible by the \nexpansion of economic opportunities outside of agriculture sector, particularly with off-farm \nemployment,  out  migration  and  its  associated  remittances.  These  economic  opportunities \nincreased real wages and boosted household consumption. However, these gains are likely to be \nreversed  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  associated  containment  measures.  The \neconomic contraction will cause significant surge in poverty and unemployment. Urban workers \nemployed in the informal sector and daily wage workers employed in the formal sector will be \nseriously affected if no offset measures were taken.15  \n \n10.  Government  response  to  the  pandemic.  The  National Security  Committee  of  the \nGovernment of Pakistan constituted a National Coordination Committee on 13 March 2020, \nchaired by the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, to formulate and implement a \ncomprehensive strategy to stop the transmission of the virus and mitigate its consequences. This \ncommittee comprises federal ministers, chief ministers, and provincial health departments and \nhas designated the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) as the leading operational \nagency. A National Command and Control Centre was established within NDMA to ensure \neffective coordination between the federal and provincial governments. In each province, a task \nforce on COVID-19 was formed, chaired by the chief minister, and the provincial disaster \nmanagement authorities support NDMA in its operations related to the COVID-19 response.  \n \n11.  The government, through the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and \nCoordination, published the National Action Plan for COVID-19 Pakistan on 13 March 2020, which \nprovides a multipronged approach to dealing with the COVID-19 emergency, including preventive \nmeasures, containment efforts, and treatment of the infected population. Expecting an escalation \nin reported cases as a result of local transmission, the government initiated several actions, such \nas (i) enhancing the existing Disease Surveillance and Response System for use as the central \ndatabase for COVID-19, into which all points of entry, quarantine sites, hospitals, and laboratories \nwould feed real-time information; (ii) setting up 294 quarantine facilities to segregate people who \ntraveled  from aboard or had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case but are not yet ill, and \n(iii) establishing 20 laboratories across Pakistan that can perform real-time polymerase chain \nreaction testing for COVID-19.  \n  \n12.  With  inputs  from  development  partners  and  different  sectors  of  the  economy,  the \ngovernment of Pakistan launched on 24 March 2020 the largest socioeconomic stimulus program \nin  the  country\u2019s  history.  The  PRs1.2  trillion  (about  $7.2  billion  equivalent) program  covers \nemergency  response,  social  safety  net  measures,  and  support  to  business  and  economy. \nSimilarly, the State Bank of Pakistan has adopted a timely set of policy actions to both manage \ninflation  and  boost  economic  activity,  including  lowering  the  interest    rate,  providing  new \nrefinancing facilities to support the flow of credit, and introducing temporary regulatory relief \nmeasures such as increased borrowing limits for individuals and deferred principal payments on \nloan obligations. The main purpose of the socioeconomic program and the PPRP health package \nis to keep core segments of the economy rolling, and to protect and sustain small and medium-\nsized enterprises and the most vulnerable segments of the society during the COVID-19 crisis, \nand to assist them in reengaging in the economy as the situation improves.  \n \n \n14 Summary Assessment of Impact and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE). https://www.pide.org.pk/pdf/PIDE-COVID19-EBook.pdf \n(accessed on 10 May 2020). \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "4 \n \n \n13.  Development  partner  coordination.  The  Ministry  of  National  Health  Services, \nRegulations and Coordination, with WHO as its technical partner, leads the coordination and \npolicy measures for the COVID-19 response together with development partners.16 It is working \nclosely  with  provincial  and  federal  entities  to  implement  the  PPRP.  A  COVID-19  donor \ncoordinating group\u2014ADB, the European Union, the IMF, UN agencies, the World Bank, and \nbilateral  partners\u2014has  met  weekly  since  24  March  2020.  Regular  updates  on  all  new \ndevelopments and changes in the COVID-19 response plans are discussed. The UN also \nconstituted a crisis management team under the leadership of WHO and comprising the whole \nUN country team to work on critical issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic. It meets regularly \nto ensure adequate preparedness for and response to any humanitarian crisis. \n \n14.  The Government of Pakistan received commitments from ADB, the IMF, the United \nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF), WHO, the World Bank, and bilateral partners to support its \nefforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and revitalize the economy. The IMF, on 16 April 2020, \napproved emergency financing of $1.386 billion for Pakistan under its Rapid Financing Instrument \nto support the government\u2019s emergency economic and social program to mitigate the impact of \nthe COVID-19 crisis, and to allow Pakistan to stay on track with its commitments to the policy \nmeasures and targets of the extended fund facility.17 On 2 April 2020, the World Bank approved \na $200 million COVID-19 Emergency Response and Effectiveness Project,18 which is part of a \ncoordinated effort with ADB through parallel financing of the government\u2019s project concept, \napproved by the Planning Commission, of a Pakistan National Emergency Preparedness and \nResponse Plan for COVID-19.19  \n \n15.  Proposed ADB support. On 25 March 2020, the government requested ADB to provide \nemergency financial support to manage the COVID-19 crisis. As immediate responses, ADB has \n(i) approved a $0.5 million technical assistance grant20 and a $2 million grant from the Asia Pacific \nDisaster Response Fund to procure emergency supplies such as personal protective equipment \n(PPE) and biohazard equipment, and support the initial capacity surge for combating COVID-19; \nand (ii) provided $30 million from the ongoing National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) \nProject21  to  procure  medical  equipment  and  supplies  to  strengthen  hospitals,  diagnostic \nlaboratories, isolation units, and other medical facilities in the country. The proposed new project \ncomplements the World Bank support and also mobilized $5.28 million in grant proceeds from the \nGovernment of Norway for the COVID-19 response. ADB is also preparing a Countercyclical \nSupport Facility\u2013COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) for $500 million. The CPRO will \nbe provided through parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s Securing Human Investments to \nFoster Transformation Program and with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank too, in close \n \n16  Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 On 12 May 2019, Pakistan reached a $6 billion 39-month extended fund facility arrangement with the IMF to help \nsupport the government\u2019s efforts to reduce public debt and build resilience while expanding social spending to \nsupport the most vulnerable. \n18 The project has four components: emergency COVID-19 preparedness and response ($155 million equivalent); \nmitigation of disruptive impacts ($42 million equivalent); implementation management, monitoring, and evaluation \n($3 million equivalent); and contingent emergency response ($0 million equivalent). \n19 The project concept, approved on 19 March 2020 for $588 million ($238 million from the World Bank and $350 million \nfrom ADB), aims to mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic through individual health, \neducation, and social protection components. \n20 ADB. 2020.

In addition to the $30 million reallocated for COVID-19 response under the \nproject, the NDRMF Board allocated $20 million of earned interest from the Endowment Fund capitalized under the \nproject. \n \n \n \n \n ", "5 \n \ncoordination with the IMF. The proposed project and the forthcoming CPRO are part of an integral \npackage of support to the government\u2019s immediate socioeconomic stimulus program and will help \nmitigate the severe health, social, and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n16.  Considering  the  comparative  advantage  of  using  existing  and  well-established \nimplementation arrangements, ADB identified the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), \nPakistan\u2019s largest safety net institution, and the NDRMF\u2014two government-owned agencies \nimplementing ongoing projects\u2014to deliver the new project. Both have established policies, \nsystems, and procedures, with demonstrated capacities in dealing with emergencies (NDRMF) \nand the social protection of the poorest segments of society (BISP). The NDRMF works with a \ndiverse set of public sector and nongovernment partners across Pakistan to support multi-hazard \ndisaster risk reduction activities and disaster risk financing. The NDRMF will use its existing \npartnerships, augmented by new partners, to implement health preparedness and response \ninitiatives to mitigate the COVID-19 impacts. \n \n17.  The government\u2019s Ehsaas Kafaalat Programme is responsible for the implementation of \nsocial assistance programs.22 Through Ehsaas, BISP currently provides targeted unconditional \ncash transfers (UCTs) of PRs2,000 per month to about 4.5 million registered BISP households \nthrough the women of the household, out of which about 0.7 million registered BISP households \nare financed under the Social Protection Development Project (Additional Financing).23 The UCTs \nhave been proven to help increase household consumption and improve the nutritional intake of \npoor households, and also boosted women\u2019s economic empowerment by enabling financial \ninclusion. The BISP program remains a considerable force of support in Pakistan's poverty \nreduction efforts.24  \n \n18.  Emergency assistance loan modality. The proposed project meets the eligibility criteria \nand relevant characteristics for emergency assistance loans. A health and social protection \nemergency assistance loan is justified because, first, it will help strengthen the country\u2019s public \nhealth preparedness and responsiveness to the escalating COVID-19 situation, and provide quick \nfinancial support to help meet the basic needs of vulnerable and poor segments of society. \nSecond, the government has immediate procurement and social support requirements. Third, \ndedicated funding for the critical health and social sector response will be assured. Finally, the \nhealth sector requires significant capacity and implementation support in the short to medium \nterm.

The project is aligned with the following impact: coping capacity of the country to deal with \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and other public health emergencies improved by 2024. The project will \nhave  the  following  outcome:  adverse  health  and socioeconomic  impacts  of the COVID-19 \noutbreak mitigated.26 \n \n20.  Output 1: Public health emergency preparedness and response strengthened. The \nsubprojects under output 1 will be delivered through contributions to the NDRMF and by using \nexisting arrangements and oversight mechanisms for the screening and accreditation of public \nand nonpublic fund implementation partners (FIPs), and subproject selection. The overarching \nframework to be financed by this output aligns with the PPRP (footnote 6). The activities \nenvisaged under this output include:27 \ni.  providing stockpiles of PPE, medicines, and medical supplies, along with inventory \ncontrol, to public health facilities to prepare them for any unexpected surge during the \ninitial 3\u20136 months, and to equip them and their frontline health workers for the projected \n9 months' duration of the COVID-19 crisis;28  \nii.  upgrading or expanding public medical facilities\u2014including but not limited to sex-\nsegregated patient wards; intensive care units; separate changing and resting facilities \nfor male and female health workers; facilities for managing COVID-19 medical waste \n(e.g.,  medium-size  incinerators,  autoclaves);  clean  energy  supply  and  backup; \ncommunications systems; and water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, as needed. \niii.  providing additional health staff for emergency surges and safeguarding essential \nhealth services; training new and current health staff on the management of COVID-19 \ncases,  risk  communication,  and  health  management  systems  (such  as  inventory \ncontrol, disease surveillance, and standard protocols); and exchanging knowledge with \nPakistan's neighboring countries and other countries in the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) region; \niv.  strengthening disaster preparedness and quick response by providing multi-hazard \nrescue and relief capacity in remote border areas, including emergency response \nvehicles, equipment, training, and supplies (Rescue 1122);29  \nv.  supporting social distancing measures, and strengthening the outreach of COVID-19 \ncommunication by establishing a multipurpose communication and education interface \nin remote and marginal communities, especially in the border areas, that have limited \ntelevision, cable, and internet coverage; and   \nvi.  providing safe community water supply and sanitation facilities for the general public in \nselected health facilities and public spaces, including in remote rural communities and \nurban informal settlements, to improve health and hygiene and reduce the rate of \ninfections. This is expected to include public handwashing and toilet facilities.  \n \n \n26 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n27 The list is indicative only; depending on the trajectory of the COVID-19 spread, changing requirements, and related \nadjustments made to the PPRP, the output may change somewhat or new outputs could be added. The subproject \neligibility criteria and approval procedures are detailed in Appendix 1 of the project administration manual. \n28 Different systems are being used for the supply chain and inventory management of COVID-19 health supplies by \ndifferent federal and provincial stakeholders. These systems include the logistics management information system \nbeing used by the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination\u2014which is not fully aligned and \ninterfaced with other parallel systems being run by the NDMA and the provinces to effectively manage both demand \nand supply for the COVID-19 emergency response, and requires further work. \n29 Rescue 1122 is an emergency service established at district level in all four provinces under an act of parliament to \nprovide timely response, rescue and emergency medical treatment to persons affected by emergencies. This \nsubcomponent will be financed by grant funding from the Government of Norway.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "7 \n \n21.  Output 2: Social protection for poor and vulnerable women delivered. The project \nwill finance the immediate additional cash transfers and provide support to the government to \ncontinue the expansion of cash transfers as the COVID-19 situation evolves. Through BISP, it will \nsupport the Ehsaas program of essential cash transfers to the poorest and most vulnerable \nfamilies for minimum sustenance support. Under this output, the project will finance (i) the \nadditional one-time cash transfers of PRs4,000 to 3.3 million women out of the 4.5 million BISP \nbeneficiary women,30 and (ii) ongoing UCT installments of PRs2,000 per month to 2.5 million out \nof the 4.5 million BISP beneficiary women for the first 4 months of FY2021,31 to enable them to \nmeet basic food needs and cover other necessary living expenses, and allow BISP to expand the \ncoverage to the next level of poor families likely to be worse off from the socioeconomic impact \nof COVID-19. \n \n22.  The BISP beneficiaries were selected using the nationwide poverty scorecard survey that \nis regularly updated. The survey used the proxy means testing method. Based on the weighting \ngiven to each question about household assets, family size, income level, and other aspects, a \nscore is given to the household to determine the poverty status. Only women from the targeted \nfamilies are eligible to receive the cash transfers. In addition, the cash transfers, through a \ntargeted approach of disbursing funds to a specified or identified group of the poorest families, \nwill also help stimulate local economies amid a countrywide economic slowdown.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB   \n \n23.  Since the 2005 earthquake emergency support, ADB has been regarded as a responsible \nand trusted partner of Pakistan with the necessary skills and proficiency to deal with disasters \nand provide rapid emergency response. ADB\u2019s disaster response projects worth more than $2 \nbillion have already been successfully implemented in Pakistan. These projects have focused on \nmulti-hazard resilient approach in its disaster risk management program. In 2016, ADB supported \nthe establishment of NDRMF, a government-owned multi-donor disaster risk fund to mitigate ex-\nante risks and provide financing options for ex-post responses to enhance preparedness for future \nnatural disasters. The donor coordination mechanism is well established and has worked well \nthroughout the major emergencies both during the relief and the reconstruction phase. With a \nwide partnership network that works across sectors and regions, the NDRMF provides a common \nwindow to pool contributions from donors to invest in COVID-19 preparedness and response in \nline with the PPRP. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  with  BISP  started  since  its  inception  in  2008.  As  part  of  the \nAccelerating Economic Transformation Program, Subprogram 1 ($500 million), ADB supported \nthe launching of BISP to mitigate the social impact of the food and fuel crises in 2007 and 2008. \nADB support to BISP has been continuous, including the ongoing BISP additional financing \nproject (footnote 23), in which ADB provides technical support to help BISP improve its financial \nmanagement and control systems and deepen its knowledge of global best practices in social \nprotection and poverty reduction. \n \n25.  The  design  of  the  proposed  emergency  assistance  project  includes  flexibility  to \naccommodate  the  changing  trajectory  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  using  multi-partner \narrangements. Both project outputs allow traceability and accountability of funds through the well-\nestablished quality control and reporting systems of BISP and NDRMF. The implementation of \n \n30 The World Bank also allocated $25 million to these one-time cash transfers from its $200 million COVID-19 \nEmergency Response and Effectiveness Project (footnote 18).  \n31 The 2.5 million eligible BISP beneficiary women to be financed under the proposed project will not overlap with ADB\u2019s \nongoing BISP project, which finances about 0.7 million eligible BISP beneficiary women. \n \n \n \n \n ", "8 \n \n \nthe project will be complemented by ongoing (footnote 20) and new technical assistance that will \npromote information sharing with other developing member countries, especially those under the \nCAREC program.32 Regional and global market information on COVID-19-related equipment and \nsupplies will be made available to concerned entities to inform and fast-track decisions on \nprocurement. Another ongoing technical assistance project attached to the NDRMF project is \nbeing repurposed to support specially designed training and PPEs for the highly exposed staff \nworking in the intensive care units.33 It will also promote the adoption of international standards \nand best practices for managing pandemics and public health emergencies, especially those \nrecommended by WHO. \n \nD.

Outputs 1 and 2 will be implemented using the respective arrangements for ADB\u2019s ongoing \nNDRMF (footnote 21) and Social Protection Development (footnote 23) projects. This will entail \nusing the same project management office, supervision and external monitoring arrangements, \nand financial management arrangements. The project steering committee will approve work plans \nand budgets and provide overall guidance in line with emergency procedures to be put in place \nfor the expeditious delivery of the project components. \n \n31.  The project procurement arrangements are based on the \u201cfitness for purpose\u201d approach, \nwith due attention to value for money, to increase the efficiency and flexibility of measures suited \nto the context of emergency assistance loans while consistent with ADB policies.36 The NDRMF \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) in engaging the services \nof national individual consultants and procuring office supplies and equipment. FIPs that meet the \nscreening and accreditation criteria of the NDRMF shall be engaged by the NDRMF through grant \nimplementation  agreements.  As  part  of  the  accreditation  process,  NDRMF  will  review \nprocurement guidelines and procedures of the FIPs and ensure that they meet acceptable \npractices for procurement, including under emergencies as specified in the PAM and applicable \npublic procurement rules. All public FIPs will follow the respective applicable rules and may \nexercise other flexibilities available under the emergency or urgency procurement procedures of \nthese rules. Procurement through UN agencies may also be considered, as appropriate. All \nnonpublic FIPs will procure following the commercial best practices by ensuring compliance with \ncore  procurement  principles.  ADB  disbursement  guidelines  and  procedures  for  financial \nintermediaries will apply to the NDRMF advance account procedure, in line with the ongoing \nproject. If FIPs are unable to transact in foreign currencies, ADB may implement direct payment \nto FIP suppliers and subcontractors recorded in the grant implementation agreements.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n32.  Pakistan will suffer significant economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic; the \nGDP growth rate is estimated to drop to \u20131.5% in FY2020 (footnote 8). The project outputs are \nexpected to provide medical supplies and other health related support as well as unconditional \ncash transfers to mitigate the immediate adverse health and socioeconomic impacts of the \nCOVID-19  outbreak.

The financial sustainability assessment of BISP, performed while processing the additional \nfinancing for the Social Protection Development Project (footnote 23) in August 2019, indicated \nsufficient funding either through counterpart funding from the government or through development \npartners to finance debt repayments, operation and maintenance costs, and other expenses. \nSupplementary analysis does not indicate conditions that may erode the financial sustainability of \nBISP. The financial sustainability of the NDRMF was assessed during the processing of the \nNDRMF Project (footnote 21) in 2016. The entity is in its third year of operations and given its \nsignificance for ADB\u2019s country portfolio and the project, a reevaluation of the NDRMF\u2019s financial \nsustainability is considered prudent.38 The loan agreement includes a covenant that by no later \nthan 31 December 2020, the government will ensure that the NDRMF submits a comprehensive \nreevaluation of its business plan and financial projections to ADB.  \n \nB.  Governance  \n \n34.  BISP is the flagship social protection program of the Government and is one of the most \nextensively documented and evaluated public sector programs in Pakistan. ADB has worked \nclosely with BISP since 2014 and helped strengthen its systems. Nevertheless, further work is \nneeded in specific areas as listed in the PAM (footnote 34), including timely completion and \nsubmission of audited financial statements, regular analyses of payment complaints to identify \ncauses and trends, and more effective follow-ups on suspected cases of corruption. A financial \nmanagement assessment was conducted, and timebound actions to mitigate the fiduciary risks \nwere agreed and included as financial covenants.39 \n \n35.  The NDRMF is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and is \nsubject to extensive statutory governance and reporting requirements under the Companies Act, \n2017 and related rules. The NDRMF has a robust governance and management structure \ncomprising a 5-member board of directors, and a management team headed by a chief executive \nofficer. A project procurement risk assessment was conducted for the NDRMF. The BISP \ncomponent does not involve procurement. The procurement risk is rated high because of the \nNDRMF\u2019s limited exposure to the health sector, engagement of several new public and nonpublic \nFIPs, the FIPs' lack of substantial implementation experience, and supply chain risk. To ensure \nthe effective management of the portfolio in the health sector, the NDRMF will acquire additional \ninternal capacities to strengthen the review of subprojects under the PPRP and accredit FIPs \nalready operating in the health sector. The oversight function will be strengthened by hiring \ndedicated consultants (Table 3) for periodic independent evaluation of the FIPs' performance. \nThe NDRMF will hire individual consultants to augment its procurement review and oversight \ncapacity,  besides  extending  support  for  building  the  capacity  of  FIPs.  The  NDRMF\u2019s \nrepresentative (consultant) will observe bid opening and bid evaluation for all FIP contracts of $1 \nmillion and above. The NDRMF will undertake sample-based post-procurement reviews of FIPs' \nprocurement actions to ensure that they are in line with their approved procurement procedures \nand any additional procurement measures set out in the grant implementation agreements. \n \n36.  The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk was assessed as substantial for the \nNDRMF and BISP because of inherent risks associated with their respective nature of operations. \n \n37  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n38 The annual approved budget for FY2021 is $40.6 million. \n39 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n \n \n \n ", "12 \n \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  confirmed  that,  at  both  entities,  the  budgetary, \naccounting,  and  financial  reporting  and  auditing  systems  and  procedures  are  functioning \neffectively.  It  also  noted  that  both  entities  have  adequately  established  governance  and \naccountability structures, and adequate accounting and finance staff in place to ensure fiduciary \ncontrol and financial due diligence. The assessment includes various risks related to FIPs dealing \nwith emergencies, while key mitigation strategies are set out in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan. Integrity due diligence on BISP and the NDRMF found no significant integrity \nrisks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, BISP, and the NDRMF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 34). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n37.  Pakistan has a large informal economy, limited employment opportunities in formal labor \nmarkets, and inadequate insurance schemes, and shows an increasing trend of natural and \nhuman-induced disasters, all which make the country\u2019s poor people highly susceptible to falling \nbelow the poverty line. The explosive increase of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan, partly driven by \nhospital-acquired infections because of weak infection prevention and control as well as spread \nin dense urban and peri-urban settlements, indicates an ongoing health crisis. Efforts of social \ndistancing and quarantining to control the spread of the virus reduced economic activity\u2014a \nnecessary public health measure at the cost of an economic slowdown. Additional support \nthrough BISP is necessary and will ensure the continuity of UCTs and provide emergency relief \nto the most vulnerable and poorest segments of society to meet their basic needs.  \n \nD.  Gender \n \n38.  In Pakistan, women are mostly found in non-wage employment and mainly work in the \ninformal economy. Statistics show that women's labor force participation is just 25%\u2014among the \nlowest rates in the region and in the world\u2014compared with 82% for men (age 15 and above). \nWomen are more likely to be laid off as a result of COVID-19-induced containment measures than \nmen. Agriculture provides most of the business opportunities for women, followed by textiles, \nbeauty care, and food processing. Most women (60% of the female workforce) work from home.40 \nThey are the first ones to lose their livelihoods because of the COVID-19-related closures of \nindustries and small and medium-sized enterprises as well as social distancing measures. \nWomen in Pakistan are more vulnerable during disasters and emergencies because of their lower \nliteracy rate, less access to information technology and marketable skills, mobility constraints, \nand less access to and control over resources. Girls are given more household responsibilities \nthan boys. The prolonged closure of schools will exacerbate the inequalities in educational \nattainment because it will lead to higher rates of female absenteeism and lower rates of school \ncompletion.41  \n \n39.  The proposed project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and will have \npositive impacts on women\u2019s well-being. In Pakistan, most nurses and other health workers are \nwomen, putting women at greater risk of exposure to the infection (footnote 41). They will benefit \nunder the project from training on self-protection and safety measures, and the provision of \nproperly sized PPE. Primary recipients of the cash transfers will be women, giving them livelihood \nsupport. Targeted distance-learning programs will be launched in remote communities to allow \n \n40 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Women Development, and Ministry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis.

To underscore its \neffective gender mainstreaming classification, the project will have the following additional gender \nactions: (i) produce sex-disaggregated data and gender analysis on countrywide COVID-19 \nmortality and morbidity rates; (ii) develop gender-sensitive COVID-19-related standard operating \nprocedures43 to be followed at health facilities and isolation or quarantine centers; (iii) provide \nUCTs to eligible BISP beneficiary women; and (iv) conduct gender-inclusive awareness raising \nand community outreach programs on COVID-19 protection and prevention measures.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n40.  Environment (Category B). The environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared by the NDRMF and ADB, since the project will be delivered through an emergency \nassistance loan. The project\u2019s public health emergency preparedness and response component \n(output 1) is expected to substantially minimize occupational and community health and safety \nhazards; but even so, operating incinerators to treat medical and infection waste as well as greater \ndemand for water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities will likely have adverse site-specific impacts \non air and water quality. The social protection component (output 2) does not involve any physical \nactivity and is likely to have no environmental impact. The NDRMF adopted an environmental and \nsocial management system satisfactory to ADB. The environmental assessment and review \nframework includes provisions to update the system to cover any additional scope under the \nproject and to ensure the design and implementation of adequate mitigation measures through \nan environmental health and safety management plan. As the safeguard capacity of the health \ncare facilities may be limited, the NDRMF will train staff on environmental and occupational health \nand safety management. The framework was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 27 April 2020. \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (Category C). The project will have \nno involuntary resettlement and indigenous people impacts as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). For output 1, the NDRMF, through its environmental and social management \nsystem, will use a screening process to ensure the project covers only subprojects with no land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The result of such screening actions and other assessments \nwill be summarized in a social safeguards due diligence report for each subproject. Social \nsafeguard monitoring will be conducted along with environmental safeguard monitoring during \nproject implementation. The monitoring results will be summarized in the social safeguard section \nof semiannual safeguard monitoring reports.
