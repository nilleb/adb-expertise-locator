This  will  create  a  healthier  environment \nand improve livelihoods in the 10 target provinces of Bac Giang, Ben Tre, Binh Dinh, Ha Tinh, \nLao Cai, Nam Dinh, Phu Tho, Soc Trang, Son La, and Tien Giang.5   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  agriculture  sector  constitutes  about  20%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \nand 25% of exports (2010), and provides employment for 70% of rural households.6 Livestock\u2019s \nshare of the agriculture sector increased from 19.3% in 2000 to 27.1% in 2009. The number of \nfarmers  and  medium-  to  large-scale  enterprises  raising  livestock  is  steadily  increasing.  This \ngrowth is contributing to economic prosperity as well as poverty reduction in rural communities. \nHowever, livestock production puts a serious stress on the environment. Discharging untreated \nlivestock  waste  carries  high  level  of  pathogens,  which  pollutes  water  resources,  endangers \nhuman  and  animal  health,  and  emits  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs).7 Furthermore,  in  Viet  Nam, \nagriculture is the highest contributor of GHGs (50%), followed by energy (25%), forestry (19%), \nand  industry  (4%).  Among  agricultural  activities,  rice  cultivation  is  the  highest  source  of  GHG \nemissions (45%), followed by livestock raising (35%).  \n \n4. \nThe Government of Viet Nam intends to progressively adopt CSAWMP by promoting the \nuse of biogas plants to treat agricultural and rural household waste. Properly constructed biogas \nplants  yield  important  benefits  by  (i)  reducing  human  and  livestock  disease  outbreaks;  air, \nwater, and soil pollutants; and firewood consumption; (ii) increasing savings of time and money, \nquantity and quality of organic fertilizer use, and access to rural income-enhancing carbon credit \nschemes;  and  (iii)  producing  biogas  that  can  be  used  as  renewable  clean  energy  (gas  and \nelectricity) as well as bio-slurry, a clean organic fertilizer. Transformation of agricultural and rural \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project preparation was funded by technical assistance attached to ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Quality and \nSafety Enhancement of Agricultural Products and Biogas Development Project. Manila (Loan 2513-VIE). \n\n3  CSAWMP  are  an  integral  part  of  climate-smart  agriculture  practices,  defined  as  \u201cagriculture  that  sustainably \nincreases  productivity,  resilience,  reduces  or  removes  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  and  enhances \nachievement of national food security and development goals.\u201d (Food and Agriculture Organization. 2011. Climate \nSmart Agriculture, Managing Ecosystems for Sustainable Livelihoods.  Rome). \n\n4   Bio-slurry  is  the  decomposed  output  of  organic  materials  produced  in  the  reduction  process  in  the  presence  of \nanaerobic microbes in a biogas digester. (Office of Scientific and Technical Information. United States Department \nof Energy. 2011. Guidebook on Biogas Development. New York).   \n\n5  The provinces  were selected  based on (i)  prevailing density  of livestock (and  hence  potential demand  for biogas \nplants); (ii) existence of and support for safe livestock zones; (iii) willingness of provincial governments to provide \ncounterpart funds; and (iv) complementarities with similar initiatives by other partners. \n\n6   Sector Assessment; Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7   GHGs  arising  from  agri-waste  mainly  comprise  methane  (CH4,  60%\u201375%)  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2, 33%\u201319%). \nCH4 is 21 times more potent than CO2, but compared with other hydrocarbon fuels, burning methane produces less \nCO2 for each unit of heat released. (International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2008. Livestock and Climate \nChange. Rome). \n\n\f2            \n \n\n \n\nhousehold  waste  into  clean  energy  and  fertilizers  through  the  use  of  biogas  plants  is  referred \nherein as the biogas value chain (BVC). \n \n5. \nViet  Nam  has  about  8.5  million  farmers  and  21,000  enterprises  raising  livestock.  The \nnumber of farms with SBPs increased from about 2,000 in 1990 to 500,000 in 2010.8 However, \nthis  is  well  below  the  government\u2019s  target  of  2  million  SBPs  and  21,000  MBPs  and  LBPs  by \n2020.  For  the  21,000  livestock  enterprises,  less  than  1,000  MBPs  and  LBPs  have  been \nconstructed. In the 10 project provinces, it is estimated that 162,350 SBPs, and 167 MBPs and \nLBPs have been constructed. This accounts for only 11% of the MBP and 3% of the LBP market \npotential. Also, no MBPs or LBPs have been constructed in Ben Tre and Tien Giang provinces; \nand  in  Binh  Dinh  province,  77%  of  livestock  farms  are  without  biogas  plants.  The  progress  in \nmeeting  the  government  targets  for  biogas  plants  is  constrained  by  (i)  lack  of  affordable \nmedium-  and  long-term  financing  for  building  livestock  waste  management  infrastructure;  (ii) \ninadequate CSAWMP knowledge transfer and development; and (iii) poor CSAWMP uptake.  \n \n6. \nThe  project  objectives  are  fully  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  Third  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2011\u20132015, which promotes resource sustainability. The Five-Year Plan for \nAgriculture  Development,  2011\u20132015  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development \n(MARD)  prioritizes  programs  to  better  control  livestock  disease  and  improve  natural  resource \nmanagement.  The  project  supports  MARD\u2019s  Action  Plan  on  Climate  Change  by  strengthening \nadaptation  and  mitigation  measures.  The  relevant  policy  frameworks  followed  by  the  project \ninclude  National  Environment  Strategy  (2001\u20132020)  and  National  Target  Program  on \nEconomical Use of Energy (2006\u20132015). The project is consistent with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015, and is included in the country operations \nbusiness  plan,  2012\u20132014,  which  envisage  continuing  support  to  conserving  and  sustainably \nusing  natural  resources  as  well  as  climate  change  mitigation.9 ADB\u2019s  \u2018Energy  for  All\u2019  initiative \nhas been providing technical inputs to project and implementation design for increased access \nto energy in rural areas.  \n \n7. \nLessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  the  experiences  of  ADB  and \nother development partners in Viet Nam and other countries.10 Based on these experiences, the \nproject  introduces  updated  biogas  technologies  and  business  models  suitable  to  Vietnamese \nconditions. Assessments of credit lines and capacity of financial intermediaries to deliver credit \nfor  financing  biogas  plant  construction  showed  that  it  will  be  desirable  and  feasible  to  use \nfinancial intermediary networks to deliver predictable and affordable financing to eligible project \nbeneficiaries.11 The  project  completion  report  of  the  Efficient  Utilization  of  Agricultural  Wastes \nProject in the People\u2019s Republic of China demonstrated that biogas plant investments are viable \nover the 6 years of project duration, as lower energy costs and greater use of organic fertilizers \nboosted household incomes by about 86% (or about 15% annually).12 In Viet Nam, households \nusing SBPs can save about $168 million annually on fuel. Savings accruing from the use of bio-\nslurry  instead  of  chemical  fertilizers  are  also  substantial,  but  vary  with  farming  systems  and \nmanagement practices. The Viet Nam Biogas Survey 2011, conducted by the Biogas Program \nDevelopment funded by the Government of the Netherlands, noted that the biogas plants also \n\n                                                 \n8   However, of the waste produced from livestock, only 3% is used as organic fertilizer and 15% is used to produce \nbiogas. Biogas plants are commonly categorized by the size of their digesters: (i) small biogas plants (SBPs) are \nup to 50 cubic meters (m3) in size; (ii) medium-sized biogas plants (MBPs) are 51\u20131,000 m3; and (iii) large biogas \nplants (LBPs) are greater than 1,000 m3. \n\n9   ADB. 2012.

Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nyielded social, environmental, and health benefits for rural communities.  \n \n8. \nKey lessons are: (i) SBP construction technology is well established, but improved BVC \nmanagement  is  needed  to  fully  realize  potential  economic  and  environmental  benefits;  (ii) \ntechnical guidelines and procedures should be simplified to enable timely subloan approval and \ndisbursement; (iii) access to credit improves livelihoods of project beneficiaries by significantly \nincreasing income; and (iv) market interest rate does not deter farmers from investing in biogas \nplants\u2014timely access to credit and technical know-how are the main constraints. \n \n9. \nThe  Vietnam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (VBARD)  and  the  Central \nPeople\u2019s  Credit  Fund  (CCF)  are  found  to  have  an  acceptable  loan  portfolio  quality,  with  less \nthan  5%  overdue  outstanding  loans  and  a  demonstrated  ability  to  reach  beneficiaries.  As \npresented  in  the  completion  report  of  the  Tea  and  Fruit  Development  Project,  $26.5  million  of \ncredit (about 88% of the ADB loan portfolio) was delivered through VBARD and CCF.13 These \nfinancial intermediaries successfully served 67,314 sub-borrowers, with a 98% repayment rate. \nIn  the  ongoing  Quality  and  Safety  Enhancement  of  Agricultural  Products  and  Biogas \nDevelopment Project, the same financial intermediaries are delivering $12.1 million of credit.14 \nAbout 43% of the credit was disbursed within a 16-month period.  \n \nB. \n \nThe impact will be less agriculture-related pollution, as measured by better water quality \n10. \ndue  to  reduced  presence  of  livestock  waste  effluence.  The  outcome  will  be  greater  CSAWMP \nuptake, as measured by increased use of clean biogas energy and organic bio-slurry fertilizers. \n \nC. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nExpanded Use of Livestock Waste Management Infrastructure \n\n \nThe project will (i) support construction of about 36,000 SBPs, 40 MBPs, and 10 LBPs; \n11. \n(ii)  empower  biogas  plant  operators,  masons,  technicians,  engineers,  contractors,  and  biogas \nassociations  to  follow  good  BVC  management  practices;  (iii) promote  the  transition  of  BVC \nmanagement from being led by government to being led by the private sector; and (iv) support \nthe government\u2019s efforts to access existing and future markets for carbon credits.15  \n \n12. \nTo support national policies, strategies, and programs aimed at compliance with biogas \nplant  technical  and  environmental  standards,  the  project  will  provide  incentives  for  carbon \nmarket development (ICMDs) to BVC owners.16 The provision of ICMDs will accelerate the rate \nof  BVC  investments  and  is  consistent  with  good  practice  by  development  partners  involved  in \nsimilar projects. ICMDs will also stimulate public\u2013private partnership, so that public investment \nin pollution control measures can leverage greater private investments.  \n \n13. \nThe  government  intends  to  recover  the  ICMD  outlays  from  the  income  earned  through \ncarbon markets. The project is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions of \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2009. Completion Report: Tea and Fruit Development Project in Viet Nam. Manila (Loan 1781-VIE). \n14  ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Quality  and  Safety  Enhancement  of  Agricultural  Products  and  Biogas \nDevelopment Project. Manila (Loan 2513-VIE). \n\n15  A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one metric ton \n\nof CO2, or the mass of another GHG equivalent to one metric ton of CO2. \n\n16  ICMDs  are  divided  into  technical  compliance  for  biogas  plant  construction  and  compliance  with  environmental \nsafeguards, budgeted at D1.2 million and D1.8 million, respectively, for each SBP; and certain incentives for MBPs \nand LBPs as described in detail in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4            \n \n\n \n\n150,000 tons annually. The project will support MARD\u2019s existing coordination and management \nentity  to  become  a  viable  carbon  market  coordinator.  The  entity  will  work  with  farmer,  biogas, \nand  other  associations  to  (i)  expand  the  use  of  a  database,  which  contains  information  about \nBVC  owners  and  those  trained  to  deliver  services  for  construction  and  operation  of  biogas \nplants; 17  (ii)  register  biogas  plant  activities  in  potential  carbon  markets;  (iii)  monitor  BVC-\ngenerated salable and sustainable carbon credits; and (iv) disseminate guidelines on accessing \ncarbon credits and revenue sharing to BVC owners and other stakeholders. The ongoing ADB \nproject (footnote 14), in coordination with the biogas program funded by the Government of the \nNetherlands, has explored revenue from several carbon markets. The proposed project will also \nexplore access to voluntary and other carbon markets.18  \n \n\n2. \n\nCredit Lines for Biogas Value Chains \n\n \n14. \nIdentified financial intermediaries are not short of liquidity, but their mobilized funds are \nmostly short term, and they are only permitted to utilize 30% of these funds to finance medium- \nand  long-term  loans.  The  project  will  provide  credit  lines  through  financial  intermediaries  to \nsmall-scale farmers as well as medium-sized and large livestock enterprises to facilitate access \nto medium- and long-term financing (up to 10 years) to expand and improve BVC infrastructure. \nThe credit lines will enable more rural people to participate in the formal financial system, thus \nproviding opportunities to access credit for additional productive purposes. Linking BVC owners \nand  financial  intermediaries  is  expected  to  accelerate  progress  toward  achieving  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nnational  biogas  targets.  The  proposed  credit  lines  will  help  familiarize  financial  intermediaries \nwith  this  previously  untapped  market  segment,  and  promote  geographic  outreach  of  financial \nintermediaries to rural household enterprises. The project will provide appropriate management \nand technical capacity building to financial intermediary loan officers to serve this market. Credit \nlines for BVC infrastructure will initially flow through VBARD and CCF, which are state-owned. \nParticipation  of  other  financiers, including  private  financial  intermediaries,  will  be  explored  and \nencouraged during project implementation. Financial intermediaries will prepare transparent and \nfinancially  sound  criteria  for  the  selection  of  sub-borrowers  to  enhance  loan  targeting  and \nrepayment.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhanced Climate-Smart Agricultural Waste Management Practices \nTechnology Transfer  \n\n \n15. \nThe  project will  disseminate  established  CSAWMP  to  beneficiaries  and  research  those \nareas  where  good  practice  is  not  well  established.  Viet  Nam  has  established  CSAWMP  in \nseveral areas. They are supported by guidelines that are ready for immediate dissemination to \nenterprises, communes, villages, and farmers. The project will improve the skills and knowledge \nof  stakeholders  for  managing  agricultural  wastes  through  dissemination  campaigns,  commune \npilot  demonstrations,  short  training  courses,  study  tours,  e-libraries,  radio  and  television \nprograms, DVDs, and information posters. Additionally, agro-ecological maps will be updated. \n \n16. \nSome  areas  of  CSAWMP  in  Viet  Nam  still  require  research  for  specific  environmental \nand  geographic  conditions.  The  project  will  support  research  activities  in  two  stages  by \nelaborating a research strategy to provide coherent direction to project research activities, and \nextending research into practice. The project will prepare a CSAWMP research strategy, which \nwill  (i)  define  the  government\u2019s  long-term  objectives  to  manage  agricultural  wastes;  (ii) assess \n\n                                                 \n17 The  database  was  created  by  the  Department  of  Livestock  and  is  currently  used  for  the  biogas  development \n\nprogram funded by the Government of the Netherlands. \n\n18  Carbon Market Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides detailed \n\nplans for carbon market development in Viet Nam. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\ncurrent knowledge and practice, along with relevant institutional issues; (iii) define and prioritize \nresearch, dissemination, and mainstreaming gaps that need to be bridged; and (iv) outline the \nactivities needed to fill the gaps. Accordingly, the project will carry out research, disseminate the \nfindings to practitioners, and mainstream them  into standard practice. Research activities may \ninclude use of non-livestock agricultural wastes for producing bioenergy and organic fertilizers, \nand application of low GHG emission practices in agriculture (including aquaculture).   \n \n\n4. \n\nEffective Project Management \n\n \n17. \nThe  government  will  provide  skilled  central  and  provincial  personnel.  The  project  will \nengage  specialist  consultants  and  contractors  to  supplement  technical  and  management \nknowledge  and  skills.  Coordination  with  relevant  organizations  will  be  a  management  priority. \nMARD  will  use  a  project  performance  management  system  with  sex-  and  ethnicity-\ndisaggregated data to accurately monitor project progress. \n \nD. \n \n18. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $84.00 million (Table 1).  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

Each committee will \nact  through  its  Department  of  Agricultural  and  Rural  Development,  which  will  establish  a \nprovincial project management unit (PPMU) responsible for province-specific, day-to-day project \nmanagement.  MARD  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  demonstrated  adequate  financial \nand  management  capacity,  and  experience  to  implement  the  project,  having  implemented \nseveral  significant  externally \nincluding  ADB  projects.  During  project \nimplementation, the CPMU will establish synergies with the ongoing ADB project for knowledge \ntransfer and capacity sharing (footnote 14).  \n \n24. \nThe  PPMUs  will  work  closely  with  relevant  stakeholders  to  disseminate  technical  and \nfinancial  CSAWMP  information  to  communes  and  private  sector  investors.  A  budgetary \nallocation is made for the facilitation and coordination costs in each participating province. Three \nimprest  accounts  will  be  established:  one  each  for  the  CPMU  and  the  two  financial \nintermediaries.  Eleven  sub-accounts  will  be  established,  one  each  for  the  10  PPMUs  and  the \ntechnical  support  unit.  The  government  will  provide  project  staff  capable  of  using  standard \ngovernment  accounting  and  financial  management  systems.  The  government,  through  the \nCPMU, will allocate financial incentives to eligible households and enterprises as an ICMD. The \nICMD  will  be  credited  to  BVC  owners\u2019  accounts  at  financial  intermediaries  once  technicians \ncertify that the BVC infrastructure meets relevant construction and environmental standards.  \n \nConsultants and other service providers will be recruited by the CPMU and/or PPMUs in \n25. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) to assist in project implementation. They will provide capacity building, research, studies, \ntraining, and other services to achieve the project\u2019s intended targets and ensure that safeguard \nissues are properly dealt with. The CPMU and PPMUs will procure goods, civil works, and other \ncontracts  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  The  project  will  be  implemented  from  2013  to  2018.

It \nis  expected  to  serve  about  36,050  households  as  its  direct  beneficiaries.  Since  it  will  reduce \nagricultural wastes, it will provide positive impacts on the life and livelihood of rural people. \n \nA. \n \n27. \nSBP  construction  technology  is  well-established  in  Viet  Nam.  For  MBPs  and  LBPs, \nhowever, technical options vary according to farm-specific parameters. The project will improve \nthe  capacity  of  beneficiaries  to  select  the  best  technical  option.  Design  and  implementation \nquality  will  ensure  that  investments  are  technically  and  environmentally  sound,  meet  CER \nmechanisms,  and  are  financially  viable.  Technical  options  are  described  in  the  guidelines  for \nBVCs  and  in  the  detailed  economic  and  financial  analysis. 22 Research,  training,  extension, \ninfrastructure, technology and other development support will improve the CSAWMP knowledge \nbase,  productivity,  and  profitability.  The  project  will  recruit  consultants  to  prepare  detailed \nguidelines for BVCs, research, extension, and monitoring systems.  \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  SBP  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  about  25.3%,  higher  than  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital (about 4.0%). The financial internal rates of return for different types and \nsizes  and  retention  periods  of the 52  models of  MBPs  and  LBPs  vary  from  \u201311.1%  to  21.1%. \nThe  project  will  select  only  viable  biogas  plant  models.23 The  overall  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  is  estimated  at  23.8%.  Sensitivity  analysis,  including  switching  values,  for  the  financial \nand economic analysis of most biogas plant types and sizes by retention show that the project is \neconomically  viable  and  sufficiently  robust.  A  demand  survey  conducted  in  five  of  10  project \nprovinces  found  that  about  80%  of  target  beneficiaries  are  ready  and/or  planning  to  construct \nbiogas plants.24 About 72% of farmers are willing to borrow to finance biogas plant construction. \nUsing  the  current  annual  interest  rate  (currently  up  to  15%),  the  repayment  capacity  of  sub-\nborrowers will be up to 5 years for SBPs and 10 years for MBPs and LBPs. Affordability analysis \nbased  on  similar  lending  arrangements  indicates  that  farmers  can  afford  loans  up  to  $2,500 \nequivalent for SBPs; $85,000 equivalent for MBPs; and $187,000 equivalent for LBPs.25 \n \nC. \n \n29. \nProcurement  funded  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  MARD  will  ensure  that  all \naccounts  administered  by  the  CPMU,  PPMUs,  the  technical  support  unit,  and  financial \nintermediaries are audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The project will strengthen \ncapacities  of  CPMU  and  PPMU  staff  in  financial  management  procedures  to  allow  efficient \noperation  of  imprest  and  sub-accounts,  and  reporting  of  financial  performance  to  the \ngovernment and ADB.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and MARD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n \n30. \nBenefits. Poverty levels among direct beneficiaries in 10 provinces range from 15% to \n25%.  Project  investments  will  generate  indirect  benefits  by  increasing  overall  access  to \nrenewable energy, a healthier environment, and rural employment. Time and cost savings from \nenergy  substitution  and  fewer  livestock  disease  outbreaks  will  boost  beneficiaries\u2019  incomes. \nApplication of bio-slurry fertilizer will improve crop productivity while reducing input costs.26  \n \n31. \nGender impact. The project promotes effective gender mainstreaming and will have the \nfollowing key gender impacts: (i) reduced women\u2019s workload related to collecting fuel wood as \nwell as time savings that can be better spent in leisure and productive activities; (ii) better health \nstatus of women and their families as a result of better sanitation; (iii) women\u2019s empowerment \nthrough access to credit for SBP construction, skills training for, and employment opportunities \nin,  biogas  plant  construction,  operation  and  maintenance;  and  (iv) more  income  from  greater \nagricultural  productivity  with  CSAWMP  technology  use.  The  project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  will \nensure that women constitute (i) at least 50% of credit recipients for biogas plant construction, \n(ii) at least 20% of those trained on biogas management and technical issues and certified as \nmasons, (iii) at least 50% of those trained on biogas technology utilization, (iv) at least 40% of \nthose  selected  as  champions  in  research  and  dissemination  of  CSAWMP  technology,  and  (v) \n30% of CPMU and PPMU staff.27 In addition, 30% of research projects will cover gender-related \nissues,  and  the  CPMU  and  each  PPMU  will  have  a  gender  focal  point.  A  sex-disaggregated \ndatabase  will  be  set  up  as  part  of  the  project  performance  management  system,  and  gender \nindicators are included in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  will  have  positive  impacts on  the  environment \n32. \nby  improving  livestock  waste  management  practices,  thereby  reducing  agricultural  pollutants \nand GHG emissions. An initial environmental  examination and environmental assessment and \nreview  framework  will  guide  project  implementation  at  all  stages.28 The  initial  environmental \nexamination  has  assessed  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  for  MBPs  and  LBPs  and \nproposed  necessary  mitigation  measures.  The  CPMU,  PPMUs,  and  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment  and  its  provincial  departments  will  manage  and  monitor  all \nenvironmental impacts or risks under the project. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). No action is needed since the project requires \n33. \nno \nimpacts.  BVC  management \ninvoluntary  resettlement \ninfrastructure  will  be  constructed  on  land  belonging  to  the  BVC  owners.  The  project  selection \ncriteria will exclude activities that entail land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement. MARD \nand the implementing agencies will monitor to ensure that land to be used for the construction \nand operation of BVCs are within that owned by the BVC beneficiaries. \n                                                 \n26  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  Initial Environmental Examination, Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of \n\nland  acquisition  and  has  no \n\nSafeguards \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Among  the  potential  beneficiaries,  several  ethnic \n34. \ngroups 29 are  considered  indigenous  peoples  under  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nThese  indigenous  peoples  will  potentially  benefit  from  the  project  through  access  to  credit, \ntechnical  support  for  SBP  construction,  and  access  to  knowledge  and  skills  on  CSAWMP.  An \nindigenous peoples plan (ethnic minority development plan in local term) has been prepared to \nhelp  them  access  project  activities  and  resources,  and  ensure  they  participate  in  the  project. \nThe plan has been endorsed by the government and approved by ADB.30  \n \nF. \n \n35. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.
