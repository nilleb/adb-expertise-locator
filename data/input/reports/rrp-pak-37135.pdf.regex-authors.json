Incidence of poverty \nremains very high. Fiscal space available to the Balochistan provincial \ngovernment (BPG) is extremely limited. Expenditures allocated do not \nadequately  reflect  medium-term  policy  priorities.  Transparency  and \naccountability  mechanisms  need  to  be  improved;  access  to  justice \nremains inadequate. Allocations are inadequate to cover the growing \nneeds  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  public  services.  Water \nresources are severely degraded and form a limiting factor to growth. \nIn sum, a lack of good governance has been identified as a central \nelement responsible for continuing low growth and increasing poverty \nwithin Balochistan.  \n   \nObjectives   The  BRMP\u2019s  overarching  goal  is  to  support  BPG\u2019s  pro-poor \ndevelopment  efforts  by  improving  governance  and  public  sector \nresource  management.  The  BRMP\u2019s  purpose  is  to  enable  BPG  to \ncreate  sustainable  fiscal  space  to  finance  the  cost  of  structural \nadjustment, and to finance high-priority social and human development \nprograms by local governments targeted at the poor, while supporting \nincreased  participation  of  key  stakeholders  for  transparent, \naccountable,  and  sustainable  public  service  provision.  Reforms  for \nunderlying systems and processes to manage public resources are \nimportant for reversing the increased incidence of poverty. Therefore, \nthe  BRMP  supports  implementation  of  the  Balochistan  Poverty \nReduction Strategy (PRS), as well as strengthening of public policy \nformulation. The PRS focuses on a growth strategy that is inclusive of \nthe poor by improving access to basic education, primary health care, ", "ii  \nadequate  nutrition,  safe  water,  and  sanitation.  Based  on  the  focal \nareas of the PRS and recognizing that most of these public service \ndelivery  functions  are  devolved,  the  BRMP  is  also  supporting \nmechanisms to improve availability of financing for local governments. \n \nThe BRMP policy objectives are to assist Balochistan through reforms \nof governance structures, systems, and procedures to (i) provide fiscal \nspace  for  sustainable  development,  and  improve  allocation  and \nmonitoring mechanisms for effective and transparent funds utilization; \nand (ii) create an enabling environment and supporting institutions for \neffective public service delivery, sustainable water management, and \nprivate sector development. \n   \nProgram Loan  The overall loan for the BRMP is $130 million equivalent. A loan of \nAmounts and Terms  \u00a512,076,350,000 ($110 million equivalent) from the ordinary capital \nresources  of  ADB  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-\nyear term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge for the undisbursed balance of 0.75% per annum \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s standard procedures, and other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and program agreements proposed to the Board.  \n \nA loan of Special Drawing Rights 13,580,000 ($20 million equivalent) \nwill be provided from the Special Funds resources of ADB. The loan \nwill have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  program \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan will onlend the proceeds of the loans in \nlocal currency to BPG, at terms similar to those given by ADB. The \nGovernment will assume the foreign exchange risks, and BPG will \nbear the interest rate risk. \n   \nCounterpart Funds   The  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  in \ndomestic currency will be used to create sustainable fiscal space and \nto  finance  the  cost  of  structural  adjustment  (the  ordinary  capital \nresources  loan),  and  for  financing  high-priority  social  and  human \ndevelopment  programs  by  local  governments  targeted  at  the  poor \n(Special Funds resources loan). Specifically, the proceeds will be used \nto restructure provincial debt by repaying at least PRs6 billion of high-\ninterest cash development loans, and any other costs directly related \nto program implementation. The Government will certify the utilization \nof counterpart funds in line with the loan agreements through audited \nstatements  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  counterpart  proceeds  will  be \ntreated  as  an  addition  to  the  transfer  allocated  annually  from  the \nGovernment to BPG. \n   ", "  iii\nProgram Period and  The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in two tranches, the \nTranching  first  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  agreed  achievements \n(conditions) upon the date of loan effectiveness and the second upon \ncompliance  with  conditions  expected  within  18  months  from  loan \neffectiveness. The closing date for withdrawals for both loan accounts \nis 31 December 2006. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Balochistan Finance Department will be the Executing Agency for \n  the BRMP, including the TA loan.  \n   \nImplementation  The Balochistan Finance Department has established and fully staffed \nArrangements  a program management unit (PMU), which will be merged with the \nexisting  Provincial  Program  Support  Office  under  the  ongoing \nDecentralization  Support  Program  (DSP).  The  extended  PMU  will \ncoordinate with the implementing agencies to ensure compliance with \nagreed  actions  and  conditions.  The  PMU  will  also  function  as  the \nsecretariat  to  a  high-level  steering  committee,  that  will  provide \nguidance  and  oversight,  be  responsible  for  interdepartmental  and \npolicy coordination, and liaise with the Government to ensure that the \nBRMP is in line with national structural adjustment and governance \ninitiatives. The steering committee membership will be similar to that of \nthe DSP steering committee.  \n   \nProcurement  The loan will finance foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties \nand taxes) of imports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries. \nThe Government will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds \nthe  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the  program \nloans in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  \n   \nTechnical  The TA Project will provide support for public resource management in \nAssistance for  Balochistan by (i) supporting assessments and analytical studies in \nSupporting Public  key  policy  and  reform  areas  addressed  under  the  BRMP;  (ii) \nResource  developing strategies to improve fiscal sustainability and public service \nManagement  delivery; (iii) assessing current data availability, and then developing \nReforms in  data  collection  and  analysis  systems  to  enhance  development \nBalochistan  planning; (iv) building capacity to carry out institutional reforms in key \n  public  sector  departments  including  planning  and  development, \n  finance,  irrigation,  local  government,  and  rural  development;  (v) \n  developing  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  monitor  both \n  intermediate indicators, and in the longer term, the poverty impacts of \n  BRMP-related  reforms;  and  (vi)  developing  a  consultation  and \n  communications strategy to engage stakeholders and to disseminate \n  information on the reform program. \n   \n  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $6.56  million \n  equivalent,  comprising  $1,305,000  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and \n  $5,255,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance $3.0 \n  million equivalent or 45.73% of the total cost under a TA project loan \n  modality. \n   ", "iv   \n  A loan of Special Drawing Rights 2,037,000 ($3 million equivalent) will \n  be provided from the Special Funds resources of ADB. The loan will \n  have 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \n  of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \n  thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \n  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  TA  project \n  agreements presented to the Board. \n   \n  The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  has  indicated  its  intention  to \n  provide cofinancing on a parallel basis through a grant of $1.92 million \n  or 29.27% of the total cost. BPG will finance the remaining $1.64 \n  million equivalent of the local currency costs or 25% of the total cost. \nThe Government of the Netherlands will finance all foreign exchange \ncosts and a portion of the local currency costs in conjunction with the \nwater resources component of the TA Project. ADB will finance the \nremaining foreign exchange costs. TA Project completion is expected \nfor 31 December 2007 and the closing date for the loan is expected for \n30 June 2008. \n   \nTechnical  The advisory TA will augment the capacity for implementation and \nAssistance for  sustainability of the reform agenda under the BRMP by, supporting \nStrengthening  capacity  building  of  the  PMU  and  implementing  agencies,  and \nProgram  enhanced policy analysis.  \nImplementation   \nThe total cost of the TA including contingencies is estimated to be \n$500,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $400,000 equivalent on a grant \nbasis from the ADB-funded TA program to cover the entire foreign \nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost, mainly for domestic \nconsultants. BPG\u2019s contribution will comprise 20% of the total TA cost. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The BRMP outcomes will help BPG reduce poverty by embarking on a \nand Beneficiaries  first set of broader policy reforms. Of utmost importance is beginning a \ncontinuous dialogue between BPG and ADB on holistic policy reforms. \nA prime benefit will be improved public policy formulation by engaging \nall key stakeholders. The development of the BRMP monitoring and \nevaluation  system  will  improve  poverty-targeted  monitoring  and  the \nevaluation  of  outputs  and  outcomes  for  the  benefit  of  future  policy \nreforms. Policy reforms will enable improved public service delivery by \ncreating  fiscal  space  that  allow  reprioritization  of  provincial \nexpenditures  and  reforms  in  revenue  generation  and  expenditure \nmanagement. Further, improvements in efficiency, effectiveness, and \nperformance  accountability  of  public  sector  agencies  will  reduce \nwastage and enable processes for sustainable management of public \nresources. By streamlining public resource management, the BRMP \nwill create the fundamentals for more opportunities through private-\nsector-led growth and employment generation in Balochistan where \nprivate sector development trails the other provinces. \n \nIdentifiable benefits will accrue over the medium term in line with the \noutcomes detailed in the program framework and policy matrix. Specific \nand immediate impacts will relate to fiscal restructuring and utilization of ", "  v\nloan proceeds for debt restructuring, which will create savings of as \nmuch as PRs1 billion per annum on debt servicing. This will be utilized \nfor improved pro-poor service delivery in line with the agreed medium-\nterm fiscal framework. In addition, a number of specific actions directly \ntargeted to the poor are included in the policy matrix such as creation of \nsustainable  water  resources  management,  a  pro-poor  food  subsidy \npolicy, and improved public services targeted at the poor. \n \nImpacts on labor markets, prices, net public transfers, and access to \npublic goods and services are expected to be positive in the long term. \nNo significant adverse impacts are directly associated with the BRMP. \n   \nRisks and  The realization of program benefits and impacts will depend on several \nSafeguards  assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks. Mitigating measures \nare integrated in the program design as appropriate, taking account of \npast experiences in program lending in Pakistan and elsewhere. \n \nPolitical  Risks.  The  political  situation  in  Balochistan  tends  to  be \ndifficult. The coalition government has a wide constituency to satisfy \nand therefore faces pressures. Secondly, some conflicts have arisen in \nbuilding political consensus around large-scale development projects \ninitiated by the federal Government. In addition, Balochistan\u2019s borders \nwith  neighboring  countries  are  porous,  smuggling  is  rampant  and \nenforcement of law suffers by having separate and coexisting rules \nand enforcement systems in some parts of the province. These risks \nare exacerbated by the size and rugged terrain of the province, and \nthe  sparse  and  dispersed  population,  which  makes  administrative \nreach more difficult. \n \nThe  BRMP  will  not  be  able  to  mitigate  all  these  risks.  Some, \nparticularly those related to the geopolitical aspects, are beyond the \ncontrol of Balochistan and even the federal Government. The BRMP \nwill assist BPG to develop its governance infrastructure to mitigate \nsome of these risks. An essential part of the BRMP is continuous \ndialogue  with  stakeholders.  The  BRMP  includes  a  communication \nstrategy  that  began  with  water  resources  management  issues  (in \nparticular on agricultural tubewell reform) under the preparatory TA. \nThe strategy will be extended to all reform areas of the BRMP to \nensure  continuity  of  support  through  all  stakeholders.  The  BRMP \nachieved strong political backing through the budget speech and the \nwhite paper for FY2005 to overcome practices of approving unrealistic \ndevelopment  schemes.  Managing  public  resources  in  an  efficient, \ntransparent,  accountable,  and  sustainable  manner  is  an  important \nprecondition to controlling political risks. \n \nGovernance  and  Bureaucratic  Risks.  There  is  a  risk  that  some \npeople  will  be  resistant  to  the  new  transparent  and  accountable \nprocesses and will be reluctant to change systems. To mitigate such \nrisks, high-level support from the chief secretary and the high-level \nsteering  committee  will  be  important.  Further  mitigation  of  risks  is \nexpected  by  undertaking  special  audits,  making  accounts  and ", "vi   \nexpenditures  publicly  available,  and  establishing  public  grievance \nmechanisms under the BRMP. \n \nInstitutional  and  Implementation  Risks.  Many  programs  and \nprojects in Pakistan suffer from implementation delays. Taking this into \naccount, the BRMP builds on experiences of a functioning PMU by \nmerging program implementation with the Provincial Program Support \nOffice  of  DSP  in  Quetta.  A  detailed  program  administration \nmemorandum will also assure the BRMP\u2019s focus not only on design \nbut on detailed implementation. To further mitigate this risk, the BRMP \nwill  have  a  strong  TA  component  focusing  on  capacity  building  to \nsupport  program  implementation,  and  thereby  build  institutional \ncapacity.  \n \nContinuity Risk. Balochistan has a very high overdraft with the State \nBank of Pakistan. Continuing such a practice without a clear-cut exit \nstrategy will set disincentives for the BPG to embark on holistic fiscal \nand financial management reforms. The BRMP incorporates measures \nto immediately freeze and reduce over time of the overdraft as part of \noverall fiscal consolidation. \n \nMacroeconomic Risks. Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic parameters have \nbeen  strong  in  the  past  2  years.  The  beginning  of  broader  policy \nreforms by the Government is showing first positive signs. However, \npoverty levels remain too high and must be addressed. \n \nThe  country  remains  highly  vulnerable  to  exogenous  shocks.  To \nmitigate such risks to the extent possible, the Government has put in \nplace a consistent economic management strategy that aims to reduce \ndebt and help ensure fiscal stabilization. \n \n ", "vii \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan Resource Management Program \n(BRMP),  (ii)  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  for  Supporting  Public  Resource \nManagement Reforms in Balochistan, and (iii) proposed administration by Asian Development \nBank (ADB) of a grant to be provided by the Government of the Netherlands for the TA. The \nreport also describes a proposed TA grant for Strengthening Program Implementation and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. Appendix 1 provides the program framework. \n   \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n2.  Economic Assessment and Outlook. Pakistan\u2019s economic performance continues to \nimprove, and key macroeconomic fundamentals during fiscal year (FY) 2004 were better than at \nany time in the past decade. In FY2004, the gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 6.4% \ncompared with 5.1% in FY2003. The manufacturing sector, a major contributor, grew by 13.1% \nin FY2004, followed by the services sector with 5.2%. However, the agriculture sector grew by \nonly 2.6%. The fiscal deficit was dropped to 3.9% of GDP in FY2004 from 4.5% in FY2003. \nGrowth in exports was robust (increasing by 10% to $12.3 billion) and the level of remittances \nhigh. Imports expanded rapidly (by 26.6%, reaching $15.5 billion), and the current account \nsurplus was reduced to $1,369 million in the first 9 months of FY2004, compared with $2,706 \nmillion during the same period in FY2003. For the fourth consecutive year Pakistan had a \nbalance of payments surplus and, as a result, foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank \nof Pakistan (SBP) increased to $10.6 billion in June 2004, equivalent to over 8 months of \nimports.  \n \n3.  Growth,  Investment,  and  Savings.  In  FY2004,  value-added  in  the  manufacturing \nsector increased by 13.4%, and in large-scale manufacturing by 17.1%, the highest growth \nachieved  in  the  last  2  decades.  With  excess  capacity  available  in  most  industries  at  the \nbeginning of the year, manufacturing production increased. Domestic demand surged, fuelled \nby an unprecedented increase in consumer credit, higher cash incomes of cotton farmers, and \ncontinuing high level of remittances. Investment increased with gross fixed capital formation in \nconstant  prices  rising  by  14.7%  compared  with  a  1.0%  increase  in  FY2003.  Inclusive  of \naccumulation of stocks, total investment increased from 16.7% of GDP to 18.1%. Foreign direct \ninvestment increased significantly in FY2004 (for the third consecutive year). During the first 11 \nmonths, foreign direct investment totaled $903 million, 21.2% higher than in the corresponding \nperiod of FY2003. Gross domestic savings remained unchanged at 17.4% of GDP in FY2004.  \n \n4.  Poverty Reduction Remains Top Priority. Strong economic growth in the last 2 years \nand substantial increases in poverty-related public expenditure over the past 5 years had a \npositive  impact  on  poverty.  The  federal  Government\u2019s  survey  of  household  consumption \nexpenditure during April-May 2004 covered 5,046 urban and rural households. Using the official \npoverty line of PRs748.56 per adult equivalent per month at FY2001 prices, the incidence of \npoverty was estimated at 23.1%, which is 4.2 percentage points lower than the poverty estimate \nfor the same period in 2001. Urban poverty seems to have decreased sharply, declining from \n23.1% to 13.6%. Rural poverty incidence also declined from 30.6% to 28.4%. However, the \nsurvey is based on a very small sample, and was carried out in selected locations; a more \n                                                 \n1  For a more detailed analysis, see Asian Development Bank. 2004. Pakistan Economic Update. Islamabad; and \nState Bank of Pakistan. 2003. Annual Report. Islamabad.  ", "2    \nextensive national household survey is required before a definitive statement can be made on \nrecent poverty levels. Poverty data is particularly weak in Balochistan and even results of more \nextensive, in-depth surveys conducted in the province may not be fully reliable.2  \n \n5.  Fiscal  Position.  The  federal  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position  improved  significantly  in \nFY2004, with its fiscal deficit declining to 3.9% of GDP. This improvement was due to an 8.2% \nincrease in revenues, while expenditure increase was contained at 3.0%. Central Board of \nRevenue tax receipts and nontax revenues showed increases, but petroleum products and gas \nsurcharges declined as the Government did not increase the domestic price of petroleum in line \nwith the sharp increase in the international price of oil during the second half of the fiscal year.  \n \n6.  Case for Continued Support. The reforms initiated by the Government 5 years ago \nhave yielded benefits in terms of improved macroeconomic indicators. The elected Government \nthat took power in November 2002 has continued to implement the comprehensive economic \nreform and poverty reduction agenda, articulated in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy \n(PRS) paper published in November 2001. The PRS was finalized and published in December \n2003. The Balochistan provincial government (BPG) is in the process of finalizing its own PRS, \nwhich is expected to be completed in November 2004.3 While the medium-term prospects for \nthe Pakistan economy continue to improve, sustained economic recovery will require managing \ncertain  risks.  With  the  relatively  more  comfortable  economic  and  financial  situation  in  the \ncountry, and the closure of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility program in December 2004, complacency could set in with regards to macroeconomic \nmanagement. This could result in slippages in the reform program. Continued implementation \ncapacity  weaknesses  could  hamper  implementation  of  the  reform  program  and  block \nimprovements in local service delivery. \n \n7.  Relationship  between  the  Federal  Government  and  the  Balochistan  Provincial \nGovernment.  As  detailed  in  Appendix  2,  the  1973  Constitution  of  Pakistan  defines  the \nframework within which the federal and provincial governments operate, and specifies the areas \nof jurisdiction of the two tiers of government, as well as the systems of intergovernmental \ntransfer of resources. Historically, relations between the federal Government and BPG have \nbeen complex. The federal Government\u2019s recent proposal to establish three new cantonments \nin the province, which has been prompted by a need to protect key energy sector installations, \nhas been unpopular with some quarters in Balochistan. Similarly, the provincial leadership has \nhad reservations about the development modalities for Gwadar Port arising out of resettlement \nissues  (irregularities  in  land  records,  difficulty  getting  ownership  titles  recognized, \ncompensation, and arrangements for displaced people) and the influx of skilled workers from \noutside Balochistan; both have created uneasiness and fear of disenfranchisement.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR4 \n8.  Public Resource Management and Governance. The ADB based the 2004\u20132006 \ncountry strategy and program update for Pakistan5 on the continued relevance of the principles \ngoverning ADB\u2019s 2002 development strategy in the country, i.e., support for good governance, \n                                                 \n2  Federal Bureau of Statistics. 2001.

", "    3 \nsustainable pro-poor growth, and inclusive social development.6 Good governance forms the \ncore, and this emphasis is reflected in ADB\u2019s lending portfolio, with several key governance \nprograms approved in the last 3 years.7 Public resource management\u2014which deals with the \noperational  communication  of  public  policies  through  fiscal,  administrative,  and  political \narrangements\u2014is a key element of governance, and if well managed, can yield substantial pro-\npoor benefits in the form of better service delivery. Resource management programs typically \npromote efficiency in resource allocation and systems for institutionalizing transparency in public \naccounts, which yield long-term benefits. Pakistan\u2019s decentralization reforms, initiated in August \n2001 with the promulgation of the Local Government Ordinance 2001, have heightened the \nneed for reform of subnational governments, including provincial and local governments. Social \nservice delivery, regulation of environmental assets, labor, and commercial activity are now \nlargely the responsibility of local governments, while provincial governments are required to \nassume a policy making and monitoring role in this regard. Provincial fiscal and financial reform \nis vital to ensure the efficient and transparent flow of funds to lower tiers of government. The \nfirst  generation  of  federal  macroeconomic  reforms  has  been  largely  successful,  with \ncountrywide  macroeconomic  indicators  improving  significantly  over  the  past  few  years. \nHowever, continued effort is required to ensure that these benefits filter down to large sections \nof the population and result in a sustained improvement in their quality of life. \n \n9.  Significance  of  Balochistan.8  Balochistan\u2014bordering  Iran  and  Afghanistan\u2014is \nPakistan\u2019s largest province, covering 44% of the total area of the country, but comprising only \n5% of the population. Only a third of the total land area of the province is productive grazing or \nagricultural land.  The  bulk  of the  labor  force  is  employed  in  agriculture,  which constitutes \nprimarily livestock rearing and dry-land farming. Balochistan has a wealth of natural resources, \nincluding minerals and hydrocarbons, which remain largely unexplored. There is little industrial \nactivity, and employment opportunities outside agriculture and mining are limited. According to \nthe  Balochistan  PRS  (footnote  3),  social  indicators  are  very  poor,  gender  disparities  are \nsignificant, and poverty levels are estimated to be as high as 47%. If poverty is considered as \noverall human deprivation comprising limited opportunities, social exclusion, and vulnerability to \nexogenous shocks, the number living in poverty would increase substantially. Poor households \nare characterized by low levels of income and education, lack of safe water, and unmet needs \nfor health and welfare services. The average household income is about $1,650 per year.9   \n \n10.  The prolonged drought, during 1998\u20132003, has had particularly devastating effects, \nwhich  have  yet  to  be  fully  quantified.

Since the rural poor usually depend on livestock \nrearing as an income source and risk mechanism, the effects on poverty are likely to be \nsignificant. Social indicators, particularly those related to women, are worse than those of other \nprovinces, with an average estimated literacy rate of barely 36% (15% for females), gross \nprimary enrolment rate of 62% (44% for girls), and infant mortality rate of 108 per 1,000 live \nbirths. The province is in dire need of development assistance to set it upon a sustainable, high \ngrowth path that enables it to exploit its, material and human resources to the maximum.  \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n11.  Impact of Decentralization. Local governments now have primary responsibility for the \nbulk of service delivery (including elementary education, curative health, rural development, \nfarm to market roads and municipal services). Provincial governments are expected to evolve \nso that their departments (including communications and works, education, health, and local \ngovernment  and  rural  development)  are  reoriented  to  provide  policy  advice  to  local \ngovernments, review their performance in key areas, and provide technical and mentoring \nsupport to local governments and service provision agencies. To carry out these functions \neffectively,  provincial  governments  must  ensure  that  fiscal  and  financial  management  is \nimproved significantly; adequate resources are available for development spending; and that \nintergovernmental financing systems function effectively.10 In addition, provincial governments \ncontinue to be responsible for policy implementation in key sectors such as irrigation and water \nmanagement, as well as industries and private sector development.  \n \n12.  Fiscal Space and Policies. Balochistan, with limited fiscal resources, generates little \nrevenue.  Like  other  provinces  in  Pakistan,  Balochistan  is  heavily  dependent  on  federal \ntransfers, which account for approximately 94% of its total revenue. There is little fiscal space in \nthe  budget\ue83aof  the  recurrent  budgetary  allocations  of  PRs28.3  billion  for  FY2005  (and  the \nrevised estimates of PRs23.9 billion for FY2004), PRs6.84 billion, or 24% is earmarked for \nsalaries  and  pensions  (excluding  the  impact  of  the  15%  increase  in  salaries  and  the \nenhancement in pension payments for retired government servants announced recently by the \nFederal Government); PRs3.55 billion for servicing of debt-related obligations (12.5%); PRs \n2.65 billion for the electricity subsidy in respect of agricultural tubewells and on Atta (wheat \nflour); and PRs10.9 billion for local governments.11 The spending pattern has not changed in \nrecent years, and the expenditure obligations mean few resources are available to finance \nnonsalary inputs required to improve the quality of service provision, to supplement operation \nand maintenance allocations, and to undertake capital investments in high priority areas. \n \n13.  Expenditure Management Issues. The budget-making exercise in Balochistan, as in \nthe rest of the country, tends to focus on annual targets and does not incorporate medium- or \nlong-term  development  objectives.  Even  the  annual  provincial  budget  sets  unrealistic \ndevelopment  expenditure  targets.  For  example,  in  the  FY2005  budget,  the  expenditure \nallocation under the public sector development program (PSDP) is PRs12.8 billion, excluding \nfederally funded schemes of PRs1.5 billion, which seems quite unrealistic given the limited \nabsorptive capacity, BPG\u2019s difficulty implementing development projects, and BPG\u2019s revenue \n                                                 \n10 Based on the National Finance Commission structure, provincial finance commissions have been established to \nallocate funds to the local governments, based on a variety of criteria, including population, area (to reflect \npopulation density), relative backwardness, revenue effort, etc., complemented with tied or incentive matching \ngrants to achieve development goals and protect crucial programs. \n11 This includes PRs8.6 billion as their 31% share of revenues under the Provincial Finance Commission award and \nPRs1.8 billion as their share in 2.5% of general sales tax collections nationally to compensate them for the loss of \nrevenues from the withdrawal of octroi and zila (district) tax. ", "    5 \nconstraints. The revised estimate for PSDP expenditure for FY2004 was only PRs7.85 billion. \nWithout  mobilizing  additional  resources  or  cutting  back  expenditures,  the  expected  overall \nbudgetary deficit exceeds PRs15 billion in FY2005. Given that the overdraft facility provided by \nSBP to the provinces is PRs700 million, the projected fiscal deficit signifies the serious fiscal \nbind under which BPG is operating. \n \n14.  BPG is expecting to narrow this gap by obtaining (i) PRs2 billion deferral on debt service \npayments to the federal Government; (ii) external assistance of PRs1.4 billion; and (iii) PRs4 \nbillion from the federal Government as arrears for the gas development surcharge, leaving an \noverall budget deficit of approximately PRs8 billion to be financed. Since BPG has already run a \nmassive overdraft of around PRs5.4 billion with SBP (owing to an overall budgetary deficit of \nPRs6 billion for FY2004) on which it is paying a penal interest of close to 5.6% on the portion in \nexcess of PRs700 million, it has no fiscal space to run such a large deficit.  \n \n15.  Public  Service  Delivery  Outcomes  and  Mechanisms.  Balochistan  has  a  largely \nrudimentary  infrastructure,  a  widely  dispersed  population,  and  a  preponderance  of  small \ncommunities in the rural areas.12 Thus public service delivery is difficult and is made even more \ndifficult because of inadequate funding and weak governance. The social indicators are much \nbelow the national average indicating deficient public service delivery mechanisms. \n \n16.  BPG operates a network of education, health, and supply services. Centrally located \nservices  are  often  overused,  while  remote  facilities  are  often  run-down  or  nonfunctional. \nCommon problems are (i) lack of funds for operation and maintenance; (ii) poor quality due to \npoor staff performance; (iii) lack of access for women and girls due to a shortage of female staff, \nparticularly  in  rural  areas;  (iv)  weak  management,  supervision,  and  monitoring  due  to \ngovernance problems; (v) limited stakeholder involvement and public accountability; and (vi) for \nthe majority of the poor, the cost of medicine, transport, school supplies, and informal payments. \n \n17.  Lack of access to basic public services of adequate quality is a major contributing factor \nto the alarming rise in poverty. The degradation of basic public services results from consistently \nlow levels of investment and the highly centralized public services management infrastructure, \nwhich  is  out  of  step  with  local  requirements  and  mostly  noninclusive.  Lack  of appropriate \nplanning  processes  and  allocation  of  resources  without  evaluating  needs  and/or  financial \nviability have led to the abandonment of many schools, health units, and water supply schemes \nbecause of lack of funds or staff, or poor design and inappropriate location. \n \n18.  Government  and  Nongovernment  Relations.  The  private  sector  in  Balochistan  is \nmuch weaker than in the other provinces. The province offers tremendous opportunities in \nsectors such as minerals, fisheries, and agribusiness, but has not managed to attract private \nsector investment for a number of reasons, including security concerns and lack of infrastructure \nfacilities. However, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and voluntary groups are making \nvaluable contributions in health and education service delivery, including for women\u2019s literacy, \nalthough they have capacity constraints. Support from education and health foundations is \nlimited, as their inputs have declined, compounded by issues around funding eligibility criteria \nand procedures, and lack of effective linkage with the districts. Considerable opportunities exist \n                                                 \n12 Quetta, the provincial capital, has a population of 0.56 million (36% of the provincial urban population) and together \nwith Chaman, Hub, Khuzdar, and Turbat accounts for 54% of the urban population of 1.57 million. Forty smaller \nurban localities (below 50,000 population) comprise the remaining urban population. Almost 25% of the rural \npopulation lives in 128 settlements (of 5,000 and above) and another 25% in 432 settlements (between 2,000 and \n4,999) while 30% is scattered in 4,712 smaller settlements (below 1,000 population).   ", "6    \nfor  public-private  partnerships  between  local  government  and  NGOs  for  collaboration  and \ncontracting out of public services to organizations with track records of effective service delivery. \n \n19.  BPG intends to more fully engage the private sector (including philanthropic agencies, \nNGOs,  and  commercial  agencies)  in  service  delivery,  including  through  public-private \npartnerships and public sector contracting. With BPG\u2019s role as primary employer is under threat \ndue to its fiscal constraints, the realization is growing that the BPG\u2019s role needs to change from \ndirectly providing key services to creating an enabling environment that encourages private \ninitiative and public-private partnerships to deliver goods and services. \n \n20.  Public Safety. The public safety situation is difficult, with organized police services \ncovering only 4% of the province\u2019s territory, and tribal recruits forming levies covering the \nremaining 96% of the province, which works to varying degrees in some districts. Despite a \nuniform civil and criminal code, no uniform system of justice is in place. The multiplicity of \njudicial systems devalues the quality of justice, adds difficulties when seeking redress, and \naggravates problems of access. Linked to this and the high degree of conflict and insecurity is \nthe lack of rights of the poor and the consequential alienation of communities from the state. \n \n21.  Water  Resources  Management.  Balochistan  has  scarce  water  resources.  The \nenvironment has been severely degraded in recent years, due to a combination of factors, the \nmost  important  of  which  is  the  drought,  which  prevailed  for  most  of  the  last  5  years. \nGroundwater resources have been severely depleted, rangelands degraded, forests decimated, \nand agricultural land rendered uncultivable, with a strong negative impact on levels of increased \nrural poverty. The rate of exploitation of the natural resource base is unsustainable, and the \ncontinued degradation of the environment is likely to result in increases in poverty, given the \ninextricable linkage of environment-development issues in the province. Water basin resources \nvary widely, with some basins having one half to one third of the average water resources. \nInefficient water use, wastage of surface water, and indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater \ncoupled with water scarcity have aggravated the scarcity, making water management a complex \nand difficult task. Presently, only 30% of the available water is utilized. A severe problem relates \nto the growing rate of agricultural tubewells, which are adding to degradation of the water table, \nand to the province\u2019s subsidy burden. The subsidy for electricity used by agricultural tubewells is \nopen-ended, with no incentive for farmers to conserve energy or save scarce water resources. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n22.  A public sector reform program in Balochistan needs to address basic issues of fiscal \nand financial management and public service delivery. These include large, inefficient, and \nuntargeted explicit and implicit subsidies; poor cost recovery against provision of economic \nservices;  inflexibility  of  expenditures;  revenues  that  are  inadequate  for  the  satisfaction  of \nfunctional responsibilities; and weak institutional arrangements for administrative functions and \nservice delivery. \n \n1.  Fiscal  \n23.  Politically Expedient and Economically Inefficient Subsidies. BPG's expenditure on \ninefficient, untargeted subsidies has assumed untenable proportions in recent years (Appendix \n2). Over the last 3 years, the expenditure on the subsidy for agricultural tubewells more than \ndoubled, from PRs838 million in June 2001 to PRs1.6 billion by April 2004; and the number of \nsubsidized tubewells grew by around 25%. In fact, the FY2004 budgetary allocation for the ", "    7 \nsubsidy was exceeded by April 2004, indicating that the actual annual subsidy could reach \nPRs2 billion by the close of the fiscal year, close to 8% of provincial recurrent expenditures.  \n \n24.  The wheat subsidy is also a drain on the provincial exchequer. BPG issues wheat at \nbelow  market  prices,  incurring  a  cost  of  around  PRs1  billion  (or  about  4%  of  the  annual \nrecurrent  expenditure  of  the  province)  as  per  FY2004  budget  estimates.13  Neither  of  the \nsubsidies is properly targeted; both create opportunities for rent seeking in the economy. \n \n25.  Unsustainable Debt Liability. Balochistan\u2019s total debt liability at the end of FY2003 was \nPRs38.3  billion.14  Its  stock  of  rupee  loans  predominantly  comprises  PRs12  billion  of  cash \ndevelopment loans extended by the federal Government; the bulk have interest rates of over \n14.5% per annum (Appendix 2). If BPG could repay the more expensive cash development \nloans, by raising loans at a cheaper rate, it could save as much as PRs1 billion per annum on \ndebt servicing alone. BPG requires a debt management strategy to address this problem. \n \n26.  Excessive Dependence on Federal Transfers. Of the budgeted revenue receipts of \nPRs26.4 billion for FY2005, close to 94% are expected to flow from the federal Government, \neither as BPG\u2019s share from the divisible pool of taxes (PRs10.3 billion, a share of 38.9%), as \nstraight transfers (PRs7.4 billion, 27.9%), or as subvention grants (PRs5.8 billion, 22%). The \nhigh fiscal dependence on federal transfers has resulted from the centralized tax structure and \nskewed distribution of tax revenues brought about by the National Finance Commission award \nof 1997, which reduced the provinces\u2019 share of federal taxes to around 10% per annum. \n \n27.  Reliance on federal transfers is also problematic as these have not only grown at a \nmodest rate of 1.8% per annum since FY2002, but have tended to be volatile and unpredictable, \nat  least  until  recently,  often  rendering  the  provincial  revenue  and  expenditure  estimates \nunrealistic. Since the potential for mobilizing revenues from taxes and user charges has tended \nto be limited, BPG has little leeway for absorbing the cost of shortfalls in such transfers. \n \n28.  Fiscal Stress. Revenues have not kept pace with growing obligations for establishment-\nrelated costs (salaries and pensions), subsidies on agricultural tubewells and wheat, and debt \nservicing. These expenditures have preempted a disproportionate share (approximately 60%), \nof current expenditures, while requirements to enhance adequacy of service and infrastructure \ncoverage have been growing. Structural rigidities in expenditure have left little for nonwage \ncomponents. A political and bureaucratic leaning to create new, as opposed to maintaining, \ninfrastructure tends to exacerbate the situation. BPG is clearly not in a position to continue such \nfiscal policies. It needs to reduce its dependence on federal transfers, develop a sustainable \nresource mobilization strategy, and create fiscal space for funding priority expenditures. \n \n29.  Low Yields from Key Taxes. BPG needs to exploit the potential of the local tax base, \ndespite structural weaknesses that constrain revenue mobilization efforts. The levy of several \ntaxes does not enable full realization of their potential for revenue generation (Appendix 2). \n \n30.  Inadequate Nontax Revenues. Nontax revenues for BPG were budgeted at PRs739 \nmillion for FY2004. Irrigation water charges (user fees), a major revenue source, should provide \napproximately PRs42 million in FY2004. The charges are levied at a very low rate, which does \n                                                 \n13 The revised annual estimates have tended to exceed budget estimates. The revised estimates of expenditure on \nthe wheat subsidy amounted to PRs1.6 billion in FY2003. \n14 This amount rises to PRs43.7 billion if the SBP overdraft as of the end of May 2004 is included. ", "8    \nnot cover the estimated operation and maintenance cost of the canal irrigation system,15 and \ntheir rate of recovery is very poor, at barely 15% of assessed value. Royalty rates for minor \nminerals are also low, primarily to encourage sector development. User charges for tertiary \nservices such as postsecondary and higher education, and curative and advanced health care \nare low and have not been adjusted for several years. \n \n31.  Public Sector Development Program. A review of the provincial PSDP and the actual \nutilization  of  funds  suggests  that  the  throw-forward16,  based  on  existing  cost  estimates  of \nschemes  (roughly  PRs41  billion)  under  implementation,  is  close  to  10  years  of  actual \nexpenditures in recent years (and 5 years on the basis of revised estimates of PRs8 billion per \nannum  in  recent  years).17  Political  governments,  in  general,  and  coalition  governments  in \nparticular (like the present one in Balochistan) are under greater pressure from civil society to \ninitiate a wide array of schemes. As a result, provincial governments launch more schemes than \nthey can fund on the basis of resource availability, forcing them to allocate small amounts to \neach scheme. Over time, the development programs become overloaded with schemes with \ndoubtful  economic  returns.  Many  facilities  are  created  that  the  government  is  unable  to \noperationalize on a timely basis, because of lack of funds. Secondly, a large share of the PSDP \nis for investments in devolved service sectors with an unusually high degree of co-occupation of \nmandates. \n \n32.  Nominal allocations for a host of schemes only vaguely reflect the priorities of the \nGovernment.  For  example,  the  Planning  Commission's  allocations  dictated  spending  of \nPRs364.57 million in FY2004, against which the PSDP allocated a mere PRs50 million (13%). \nSuch misallocations result in time and cost overruns, sometimes exceeding the project benefits. \n \n33.  Contingent  Liabilities. BPG  does  not  maintain  funded  general  provident  fund  and \npension fund schemes, and the liabilities on both these accounts have not been determined.  \n  \n34.  Expecting a significant increase of revenue transfers to the provinces under the 1997 \nNational  Finance  Commission  award,  the  federal  Government  discontinued  the  cash \ndevelopment  loan  facility,  forcing  BPG  to  finance  the  entire  cost  of  ongoing  development \nprojects from its own resources. With provincial borrowings curtailed to overdraft arrangements \nwith SBP, BPG\u2019s overall budgetary deficits can only be financed by building up arrears (by \npostponing payments to discharge established or unaccounted for liabilities to contractors, etc.) \nand by utilizing/borrowing the off-budget funds held by the Government in a fiduciary capacity \nand reflected in the movement on the public fund account. This is a high-cost component of \ndebt, with servicing costs not fully reflected in budgetary expenditures. The latter outcome is \nreflected in the uncovered gap between the amount set aside by BPG to settle its obligations for \nthe general provident fund and the actual liability for this account. \n \n                                                 \n15  This is exclusive of PRs40 million for salaries. \n16 The throw forward is the excess of the cost of a development scheme over the current financial year\u2019s allocation, \nand is one of the measures to analyze the sustainability of the development budget. It provides information on how \nmany years it will take to complete a development scheme, or in how many future budgets the scheme will have to \nappear. \n17 The PRs41 billion estimate of expenditure still to be incurred on ongoing or sanctioned schemes to complete them, \nis based on the historical cost estimates of these schemes. Some of these schemes are quite old and have been \nimplemented for several years. Their cost schedules require updating. ", "    9 \n2.  Governance  \n35.  A  central  element  of  BPG\u2019s  poor  development  performance  entails  significant \ngovernance issues encompassing public institutions and functions at all levels. Improvements in \npublic  sector  governance  and  resource  management  are  known  to  yield  considerable \ndevelopment gains. For Balochistan, the key governance challenge lies in ensuring effective \nfunctioning of decentralized systems of governance. Strengthening public policy formulation and \nfostering  participatory,  transparent,  and  accountable  systems  and  processes  are  other \nelements. Economic activity is unlikely to accelerate unless conditions improve significantly, and \naccess to justice is ensured to all sections of society. \n \n36.  Issues of Devolution. Since Pakistan initiated its ambitious Devolution Plan in 2001, a \nmajor transition process has been ongoing. All tiers of government need to comply with their \nnew roles and responsibilities. Systems and processes still have to be fully institutionalized to \nachieve the awaited higher benefits of better public service delivery. So far, the process has not \nbeen backed-up by the transfer of political, administrative, and fiscal decision-making authority \nand  resources.  This  is  leading  to  unrealistic  popular  expectations and  frustration  over  the \nperceived  lack  of  concrete  visible  products,  despite  some  improvements  in  public  service \ndelivery. The legacy of multiple side-by-side agencies with uneven roles, responsibilities, and \nresources remains. The dual structure has been maintained in districts and municipalities with \nthe existence of both provincial departments and local governments with limited resources. \n \n37.  Local governments have not yet set up linkages across jurisdictions as stipulated in the \nBalochistan Local Government Ordinance (BLGO). The local government commission has not \nbeen constituted in accordance with the provisions of the law and has yet to be made fully \nfunctional. Zila musharwat (district consultation) committees have not assumed an effective role \n(and in some cases, have not been constituted) and joint committees of district governments \nand of tehsil18 municipal administrations (TMAs) have not been formed. \n \n38.  Lack of Administrative Decentralization. While responsibility for providing basic public \nservices  in  health,  education,  water,  and  sanitation  have  clearly  been  assigned  to  local \ngovernments under the law, commensurate administrative authority and staff have not yet been \nassigned. Public health engineering staff have been retained at the district rather than devolved \nto TMAs. Works department staff have been transferred, while repair and maintenance funds \nand  all  development  expenditure  are  retained  by  the  provincial  department.  BPG  controls \npersonnel management and continues to exercise administrative powers over postings and \ntransfers. BPG staff working for district governments retain direct links with their provincial \nadministrative departments at the cost of horizontal linkages and coordination within the district \ngovernment. Areas such as recruitment and intergovernment relations in terms of monitoring \nresponsibilities  are  still  fairly  fluid.  This  situation  seriously  hampers  the  ability  of  local \ngovernments to enforce discipline and hold staff accountable for performance, let alone embark \non rationalization, restructuring, and redeployment. The responsibilities assigned to the local \ngovernments under the local government legislation cannot be exercised in the absence of rules \nframed  by  BPG.  These  include  rules  transferring  powers  for  appointment,  postings  and \ntransfers;  administrative  approval  and  technical  sanction  of  development  schemes;  and \nenforcement of efficiency and discipline rules. \n \n39.  Lack  of  Fiscal  Decentralization.  Local  governments  have  not  been  provided  with \nadequate  fiscal  resources  or  financial  control.  Transfers  through  the  Provincial  Finance \n                                                 \n18 Tehsil is a sub-district of a division in Pakistan. ", "10    \nCommission (PFC) award barely cover salary costs and no funds have been transferred from \nthe provincial development budget. The lack of transfers has serious implications for the political \nsurvival  of  the  local  government  system.  Provincial  department  control  of  repair  and \nmaintenance  funds  for  roads  and  public  buildings  affects  maintenance  of  physical  assets. \nDecentralization can only be actualized when fiscal and financial powers are transferred.  \n \n40.  Role of the Provincial Government. The provincial departments function under BPG\u2019s \nrules of business, which have not been made consistent with the local government legislation. \nConforming to the new legislation is necessary to define an effective role for the provincial line \ndepartments  in  policy  making,  standard  setting,  quality  control  and  monitoring,  with \nmanagement and control over devolved subjects being exercised by the local governments. \n  \n41.  Accountability in Financial Management. Lack of accountability and transparency in \nfinancial management and absence of transparent rules provide rent-seeking opportunities for \npublic officials. Government accounts are prepared manually and are single-entry, cash-based \nsystems. Such systems are inherently incapable of capturing accounting data on a timely basis. \nThe  absence  of  proper  documentation  to  support  expenditures,  misclassification  of \nexpenditures, lack of accountability, and corruption in the use of public funds and assets has \naffected  the  reliability,  accuracy,  and  transparency  of  the  accounts.  Internal  controls  and \ncompliance with even reasonably sound rules and regulations have deteriorated due to lack of \nattention by some principal accounting officers, worsening incentives within the civil service to \nhave a well-trained financial cadre, and lack of accountability of those not following prescribed \nprocedures. \n \n42.  Transparency and Public Disclosure. Transparency needs significant improvement in \nthe working of government at all levels and in all spheres. Public disclosure of information is \nlargely limited to statements and press notes issued by government ministers and departments \nand to gazette notifications. Very few documents are released to the public and even obtaining \nthem is difficult. The budget, although a public document, is not available as a priced document. \nEven if it  were easily available, the format  does not allow for ease of understanding. No \nsystematic reports on the performance of BPG or local governments on major procurement, \nrecruitment, or other matters of public concern are regularly released. The lack of transparency \nof the BPG\u2019s fiscal position and activities means the public has little opportunity for interface on \ncritical issues facing BPG and on matters concerning its relations within the federation. \n \n3.  Institutional \n43.  Human Resource Management. Balochistan\u2019s scarcity of highly skilled workers and \npoor education system contribute to the paucity of efficient public sector workers and the very \nsmall pool of skilled workers for employment by the private sector. The problem is compounded \nby poor transparency in public sector recruitment and lack of adherence to principles of merit-\nbased recruitment. These result in problems of managerial capacity in the province generally. \n \n44.  Institutional Issues in Financial Management. The province has two district account \noffices, while the federal accountant general has two suboffices. Some districts have treasury \noffices, reporting to the provincial Finance Department, but with no responsibility to maintain \naccounts. Some districts do not have a bank. Travel from some districts to and from the \nprovincial capital takes more than a day. There is also a dearth of motor vehicles. All these \nfactors hinder regular inspections and field visits of office staff, creating problems in maintaining \nappropriate controls over expenditures, tracking transactions, and carrying out reconciliations of \naccounts in a timely manner. ", "    11 \n \n45.  Increasing Demand for Water. As human and livestock populations increase, demand \nfor water is increasing. The annual growth rate of tubewell-irrigated areas is alarming, indicating \ngrowing demand for water in the agriculture sector. The future increase in demand for human \nand livestock populations will largely be met from the existing share of the agriculture sector, \nthus groundwater available for agriculture will continue to decrease. The problem is exacerbated \nby reduced stream flows during droughts, which impact wetlands and marshes in low-lying \nareas. Ensuring minimum water requirement for nature and ecosystem needs will affect the \navailability of surface water. \n \n46.  Excessive Mining of Groundwater. The dramatic increase in the number of tubewells \nfollowed the introduction of the national electricity grid system in the 1970s. The annual growth \nrate of electric tubewells during the last 17 years is around 6.7% and of diesel tubewells around \n7.4%. The increasing use of tubewells has resulted in lowering of the water table and mining of \ngroundwater. In spite of this, additional tubewells are being installed to meet the rural, urban, \nand agriculture requirements. The reasons for unsustainable groundwater mining include (i) \ncontinued increase in water demand, (ii) lack of incentives for efficient water use due to the \nheavily  subsidized  electricity  tariff,  (iii)  unsustainable  level  of  groundwater  abstraction,  (iv) \nneglect of natural recharge systems, and (v) ineffective and costly techniques for inducing \nrecharge to the groundwater. Almost all fruits, vegetables, and winter fodders are over irrigated. \nTrickle irrigation schemes are being tried, but are not widely accepted by farmers as water is not \na priced commodity. The provincial concept of farm water management was adopted from \ncanal-irrigated areas and has not been adapted to the fragile ecosystems of the province. \n \n47.  No Comprehensive Water Resources Management. The current water management \nstrategy is not putting enough emphasis on surface water sources, which contribute 96% of the \ntotal available water. Simply expanding the capacity of the existing canal network, within the \nlimits of water allocations to the province posed by the Water Apportionment Accord, can \nenhance canal water supplies from the Indus River. Floodwater management is directly linked \nwith recharge of groundwater, and thus must be given due attention considering a holistic \napproach, i.e., managing surface and groundwater in an integrated fashion. Water resource \nassessment  and  monitoring  have  hindered  the  development  of  effective  strategies  for \nsustainable  water  resources  management.  Besides  problems  with  data  (inadequate  data, \ninadequately  trained  technical  staff,  differences  in  instrumentation  and  measurement \ntechniques, lack of timely data processing and analysis, discontinuity in records) Balochistan is \nhampered by two agencies dealing with hydro-meteorological data. They do not effectively \ncoordinate and do not have adequate linkages with research institutions. \n \n48.  Severe Gender Inequalities. Balochistan\u2019s social indicators clearly highlight gender \ninequality. The female literacy rate is 16% compared with 32% nationally; the maternal mortality \nrate is 400 compared with 340 for Pakistan as a whole; the enrollment rate for girls is 16% as \nagainst  49%  for  boys  in  the  province;  and  there  are  115  men  for  every  100  women  in \nBalochistan. Women\u2019s access to social services and other supportive infrastructure is limited, \ndue to restrictions on their mobility. The tribal culture of Balochistan limits women\u2019s access to \ndecision making; and sociocultural norms around women\u2019s roles and concepts of honor further \nlimit women\u2019s access to public space. The percentage of labor force participation of women is \nreported as 2.07 as against 65.88 for men (footnote 3). Cases of violence against women are \nfrequently reported. These factors combine to result in fewer opportunities for education, low \nemployment, low income, few female titles to property, and little participation in the community \nand  society.  Furthermore,  a  patriarchal  bias  within  state  institutions  translates  into \nunderinvestment for women\u2019s needs. ", "12    \n \n49.  BPG recently approved a comprehensive gender reform action plan (GRAP) to resolve \nthese issues. The success of any reform, particularly gender and governance reforms is subject \nto numerous constraints, limitations, prerequisites, and sociopolitical variables. Continued policy \nand financial commitment by BPG will be required for successful implementation of the GRAP.  \n \n4.   Lessons Learned \n50.  Lessons can be drawn from previous experience in policy-based adjustment lending by \nADB and other funding agencies in Pakistan,19 as well as from ADB support for governance and \nresource management programs elsewhere. Considerable experience has been gained with \nprogram  lending  in  Pakistan.  Since  1999,  ADB  has  approved  eight  program  or  sector \ndevelopment program loans. Generally, implementation of these loans has been progressing \nsatisfactorily.  Key  lessons  learned  include  the  importance  of  ownership  and  a  committed \nexecuting  agency  to  drive  implementation;  need  for  broad-based  political  support  and \nconsultation in particular for cross-sector reforms; focused design and realistic implementation \ntime frames; and strong implementation support, including TA loans. A stronger focus of ADB \non implementation is important to overcome delays in implementation.  \n \n51.  Familiarity  with  adjustment  lending  at  the  provincial  level  is  growing  in  Pakistan. \nProvincial resource management programs are supported in Sindh and North-West Frontier \nProvince by World Bank, and in Punjab by ADB. Key lessons include the importance of taking \ninto account provincial considerations and capacities. For programs of such complex nature \nhigh-level government support in steering committees is important to avoid interdepartmental \nconflicts, which often decelerate implementation progress. Resource management programs \nshould  always  be  designed  vehicles  to  sustain  continuous  policy  dialogue.  Therefore, \nconsultation  is  not  only  important  in  the  program  design  phase  but  throughout  program \nimplementation. To support dialogue, a communication strategy is essential to meet the different \nand specific stakeholder needs. Time frames should not be too short, and designs should \nalways support flexibility and sequencing of policy reform. These lessons are incorporated in the \ndesign and implementation arrangements of the BRMP. \n \n5.   External and Asian Development Bank Assistance \n \n52.  Program  formulation  was  coordinated  with  various  stakeholders  from  all  levels  of \ngovernment, the private sector, NGOs, and other development partners. An overview of the \nprocessing  steps,  approaches,  and  background  studies  undertaken  is  provided  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  A.  Summary  information  on  external  assistance  to  the  sector  is \npresented in the development coordination matrix (Appendix 3). Further information on ADB \nassistance  to  Balochistan  and  on  governance  projects  and  programs  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. The program framework is in Appendix 1, and the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix are in Appendixes 4.  \n \n                                                 \n19  A more general description of lessons by ADB from lending is in ADB. 1999. Review of ADB\u2019s Program Lending \nPolicies. Manila.  ", "    13 \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n53.  Reducing Poverty. The overarching goal of the BRMP is to support BPG\u2019s pro-poor \ndevelopment efforts by improving governance and public sector resource management. The \nBRMP\u2019s purpose is to enable BPG to create sustainable fiscal space to finance the cost of \nstructural adjustment, and to finance high-priority social and human development programs by \nlocal  governments  targeted  at  the  poor,  while  supporting  increased  participation  of  key \nstakeholders for transparent, accountable, and sustainable public service provision. Reforms of \nunderlying systems and processes to manage public resources are important for reversing the \nincreasing  incidence  of  poverty.  Therefore,  the  BRMP  supports  implementation  of  the \nBalochistan PRS (footnote 3) and strengthening of public policy formulation. \n \n54.  The federal PRS bases poverty reduction on the four pillars of (i) increased economic \ngrowth through sound macroeconomic management, fiscal and financial reforms, expansion of \ninfrastructure, and rural development; (ii) improved governance and devolution; (iii) investment \nin  human  capital;  and  (iv)  targeting  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  In  addition  to  these,  the \nBalochistan PRS stresses two major areas of specific concern: (i) managing scarce water \nresources, and (ii) addressing vulnerability to shocks. It focuses on a growth strategy that is \ninclusive of the poor by providing improved access to basic education, primary health care, \nadequate nutrition, safe water, and sanitation. Based on these focal areas and recognizing that \nmost  of  these  public  service  delivery  functions  are  devolved,  the  BRMP  will  support \nmechanisms that improve the availability of financing for local governments.  \n \n55.  Realign Governance Structures, Systems, and Procedures. The purpose and policy \nobjectives of the BRMP are to help Balochistan reform governance structures, systems, and \nprocedures to \n \n(i)  provide fiscal space for sustainable and pro-poor development, and improve allocation \nand monitoring mechanisms for effective and transparent utilization of funds; and  \n(ii)  create the enabling environment and supporting institutions for effective public service \ndelivery, sustainable water management, and private sector development.  \n \n56.  Program Modality. Balochistan needs to embark\u2014like the other provinces\u2014on wider \nand holistic reforms to make its policies sustainable and reduce its dependence on federal \nGovernment transfers. Such reforms need to be sequenced over a long period. The BRMP by \nitself can only trigger the reform by linking multiple commitments under one umbrella. The \nBRMP  intends  to  set  the  policy  path  for  other  ADB  investments,  such  as  the  proposed \nBalochistan  Rural  Development  and  Drought  Mitigation  Project  and  Balochistan  Devolved \nSocial  Services  Program.  Secondly,  the  BRMP  aims  to  strengthen  ongoing  reforms,  most \nnotably the Decentralization Support Program (DSP) and the Access to Justice Program. The \nBRMP is designed as a two tranche program covering 2 fiscal years. However, the BRMP will \ndevelop criteria that can lead to a second program. To support institutional development as well \nas implementation capacity for the reform program, a comprehensive TA loan will be provided, \nsupplemented by a substantial TA grant from the Government of the Netherlands. An advisory \nTA grant will augment the capacity for implementation and sustainability of the reform agenda \nunder the BRMP. This TA will support capacity development for program implementation. \n ", "14    \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n57.  Formulation and design of the BRMP are anchored on the following six principles \n \n58.   Strong Leadership, Ownership, and Consultation. The BRMP is supported by the \nCabinet and will be supervised by a high-level steering committee. The chief secretary will \nprovide policy guidance to the steering committee. Program formulation was supported by broad \nstakeholder consultation, including civil society groups and political parties.  \n \n59.  Umbrella  Approach  and  Strong  Coordination.  The  BRMP  uses  an  umbrella \napproach, linking governance programs and upcoming service-delivery programs for a more \ncoordinated approach for implementation. \n  \n60.  Strong Emphasis on Implementation and Poverty Monitoring. A PMU will oversee \nBRMP implementation with a special focus on making a comprehensive program monitoring \nand evaluation system operational. Poverty outcomes will be assessed through (i) an annual \nperformance review that will focus on the BRMP\u2019s poverty reduction impact, and (ii) monitoring \nsystems to track the effect of reforms on the living standards of the poor over time. \n \n61.  Mechanisms to Foster Civil Society Participation. The development of an annual \nBalochistan development forum is a central measure to improve public policy formulation. To \nensure proper and continuous civil society engagement, the BRMP will support civil society \ndevelopment activities. \n \n62.  Promotion of Private Sector Involvement. The BRMP will strengthen frameworks to \nallow for better private sector investments and promote private-public partnership to enhance \nservice delivery functions.  \n \n63.  Creation of Fiscal Space. The BRMP finances measures to create fiscal space within a \ndefined medium-term budget framework rather than finance incremental sector spending that \nmay not be sustainable.  \n \n1.  Design of the Program Loan \na.  Conceptual Framework \n64.  Program  Structure  and  Nomenclature.  The  BRMP  is  designed  as  a  three-level \nprogram loan (reform outcomes, policy reform areas, and tranche achievements (Table 1)). To \naddress  the  two  main  reform  outcomes  (enhanced  provincial  finances  through  fiscal \nrestructuring and financial management, and enhanced processes and adequate institutions for \npublic and private service delivery), the program reforms are structured in seven policy reform \nareas (PRAs): (i) rationalize poorly designed, untargeted subsidies; (ii) broaden the tax base, \nexpand  coverage,  and  rationalize  user  charges;  (iii)  establish  reliable,  transparent,  and \naccountable financial management systems; (iv) establish and implement transparent, rule-\nbased systems of local government funding; (v) improve administrative frameworks for effective \npublic service delivery; (vi) create an enabling environment for private sector development and \npromote public-private partnerships in service delivery; and (vii) improve management and \nsustainability of water resources. Specific achievement targets have been identified for all the \nPRAs. Meeting the achievement targets will trigger the release of the tranches. To meet the \nachievement targets and to judge whether sufficient progress has been made, a set of agreed \nactions must be implemented. All agreed actions for the first tranche are preconditions for Board ", "    15 \napproval. There is some flexibility in adjusting the actions for the second tranche release, if the \nGovernment can credibly demonstrate that the achievement can be reached by alternative \nactions.  \n \nTable 1: Program Framework Summary \n   \nTranche \n   \nAchievements \nReform Outcomes  Policy Reform Areas \n     \n1  2 \nA.

Improve management and sustainability of \nwater resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n65.  Umbrella Function. While the other provinces have started far-reaching policy reforms, \nBalochistan is still lagging. The BRMP is designed to support the reform outcomes by creating \nfiscal space, providing  a policy umbrella for  upcoming ADB investments, and coordinating \nongoing reform initiatives. The BRMP should be understood as a long-term ADB commitment \nfor policy reform support in Balochistan. The loan covers 2 fiscal years, but opens the agenda \nfor  reforms  beyond  that  period.  The  3-year  TA  loan  supports  capacity  development  for \ncontinuing the reform efforts aimed at efficient and sustainable public resource management. \n \n66.  Improved Public Policy Formulation and Transparent and Accessible Policies. The \nBRMP is closely linked to the PRS. Because the Balochistan PRS does not currently address \npolicy implementation, the BRMP will support mechanisms leading to improved public policy \nformulation and transparent governance.  \n \n67.  Poverty Monitoring Function. The BRMP will support BPG\u2019s reform efforts to reduce \npoverty. The monitoring and evaluation framework will therefore assess the degree to which the \nBRMP and its institutional changes impact on the everyday lives of the poor, in the areas of \npoverty  reduction,  efficiency,  equity,  governance  and  accountability,  information  systems \nmanagement and transparency, as well as the functioning of intragovernment relations. Overall, \npoverty impact will only start to become visible within the time horizon for the BRMP. However, \na baseline will be established and systems and procedures put in place for longer term impact \nmonitoring and assessment. This will help BPG determine the poverty reduction impact of \nreforms  and  provide  stakeholders  with  access  to  information  about  the  financial  resource \nimplications of government policy. ", "16    \n \n68.  Anticorruption  Measures.  The  principle  anticorruption  measures  promoted  by  the \nBRMP derive from the improved financial management systems and procedures, including \nprocurement procedures, training for treasury department officials, increased public access to \ngovernment  budget  documents,  transparent  rules  for  government  employee  postings, \npromotions and transfers, and development of public grievance redress mechanisms. This lays \nthe  basis  for  subsequent  accountability  and  enforcement  mechanisms  to  enhance \naccountability.  In  addition,  the  BRMP  promotes  special  audits.  Specific  anticorruption  and \nincreased accountability measures are outlined in the agreed actions under PRA 3 (establish \nreliable, transparent, and accountable financial management systems), PRA 4 (establish and \nimplement transparent, rule-based systems of local government funding), and PRA 5 (improve \nadministrative frameworks for effective public service delivery) in the policy matrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n69.  Achievement targets for tranche releases with supportive actions are detailed for each \nPRA in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. An environmental assessment of the policy measures in \nthe policy matrix was undertaken and is included in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nb.  Program Structure \ni.  Reform Outcome 1. Enhanced Provincial Finances through \nFiscal Restructuring and Financial Management \n70.  PRA 1. Rationalize Poorly Designed, Untargeted Subsidies. One major challenge of \nthe BRMP is to make water resources management sustainable. Immediate action is required to \nrationalize the agricultural tubewell subsidy. Measures will be introduced to cap and phase out \nthe subsidy by introducing an incentive system that encourages sustainable water use. The \ngeneral and untargeted wheat subsidy will be removed and may be replaced by an Atta subsidy \ntargeted to the poor and more vulnerable segments of the population.20 \n \n71.  PRA 2. Broaden Tax Base, Expand Coverage, and Rationalize User Charges. The \nBRMP  will  introduce  measures  to  enhance  the  revenue  yield  from  various  taxes  such  as \nproperty tax, motor vehicle taxes, stamp duty, and general sales tax on services. An auction will \nbe introduced for rights to collect royalties on minor minerals. Increases in the rates of abiana \n(water charges) will be introduced, and improvements implemented for the recovery of billings to \nachieve full cost recovery for the provision of irrigation water in the medium to long term. A \npolicy will be developed and implemented to rationalize the agricultural income tax.  \n   \n72.  PRA 3. Establish Reliable, Transparent, and Accountable Financial Management \nSystems. The BRMP will support the rationalization of the PSDP. Overall, the throw-forward \nneeds to be reduced by prioritizing schemes and placing greater emphasis on completing \nongoing projects by allocating funds on the basis of the phasing built into their respective \nPlanning Commission pro-forma I21. Moreover, the size and composition of the PSDP needs to \nfactor in the post-devolution division of responsibilities. New tax and user-charge policies will, by \nthe time of the second tranche, be published on the BPG web site. \n \n                                                 \n20  The new scheme targeted to the poor will be based on the most current poverty assessment. Further poverty \nimpact assessments will be supported under the TA accompanying the BRMP. \n21 The Planning Commission pro-forma I is essentially the project feasibility document. ", "    17 \n73.  The BRMP will facilitate assessment of the liabilities for the currently unfunded general \nprovident fund and pension fund schemes to enable the development of a strategy to establish \nseparate funds to discharge related obligations in the future. \n \n74.  The BRMP aims to increase\u2014by taking local languages into account\u2014public access to \ninformation, introduce transparency, foster policy dialogue, and provide ways for better public \npolicy formulation. Therefore, the BRMP will help improve the content and presentation of \nbudget documents. A BPG web site will disseminate budget information, financial accounts of \nBPG departments, and other important documents to enable wider policy dialogue.  \n \n75.  PRA  4.  Establish  and  Implement  Transparent,  Rule-Based  Systems  of  Local \nGovernment Funding. The PFC method of fixing the provincial allocable according to the \nprevious years\u2019 actual salary expenditure does not take into account vacant positions in the \nlocal governments or new positions to make operational the new or the nonfunctional facilities. \nA salary increase of 15% effective 1 July 2004 has also to be taken into account. Only a bare \nminimum  of  nonsalary  expenditure  is  provided  to  local  governments,  and  repair  and \nmaintenance expenditure for devolved functions and operational costs of water supply schemes \ncontinue to be included in the provincial recurrent budget. No development funds from the \nPSDP are provided to the local governments. The PFC award needs to consider the functional \nmandates of the local governments to determine allocation of resources consistent with their \nexpenditure  assignments.  The  PFC  award  is  therefore  expected  to  design  more  equitable \narrangements for the distribution of resources between the province and the local governments \nand between local governments to enable each level of government to fulfill its mandated \nresponsibilities in an efficient and effective manner. \n \nii.  Reform  Outcome  2.  Enhanced  Processes,  and  Adequate \nInstitutions for Public and Private Service Delivery \n76.  PRA 5. Improve Administrative Frameworks for Effective Public Service Delivery. \nThe responsibilities of the provincial government departments for the sectors/subjects devolved \nto local governments (education, health, municipal services, agriculture, livestock, and others) \nneed to be redesigned, their role in policy formulation and standard setting strengthened, and \ntechnical  support  and  capacity  building  provided  for  local  governments,  in  addition  to \nsupervision. As an upfront action BPG approved the Balochistan GRAP, which now has to be \nimplemented and will require continued political and fiscal support. Procedures for third party \nassessment and evaluation as a permanent feature of public resource management processes \nwill be implemented. \n \n77.  PRA  6.  Create  an  Enabling  Environment  for  Private  Sector  Development  and \nPromote  Public-Private  Partnerships  in  Service  Delivery.  Innovative  and  successful \ninitiatives as well as opportunities and options for public-private partnerships and private sector \nparticipation are not widely known. The private sector, on the other hand, is making a significant \nand expanding contribution to health care provision. The BRMP will help BPG hold public \nconsultations,  prepare  and  implement  a  private  sector  development  strategy,  and  initiate \nimplementation of the strategy in the health and water sectors. \n \n78.  PRA 7. Improve Management and Sustainability of Water Resources. Water has \nbecome the major limiting factor to growth. Presently, BPG has no comprehensive water policy. \nThe BRMP will help BPG and stakeholders develop such a policy and a time-bound action plan. \n ", "18    \nC.  Important Features \n79.  The  BRMP  design  was  closely  coordinated  with  other  ADB  and  development \ninvestments  in  Balochistan.  Implementation  also  takes  into  account  the  comparatively  low \ncapacity level by linking the BRMP directly with an existing and experienced PMU, established \nfor  the  DSP  in  Balochistan.  This  should  not  only  bring  about  practical  implementation \nexperience but also exploit all possible synergies of both programs to the largest extent.  \n \n80.  An important feature relates to the agreement reached between ADB and BPG on the \nallocation of loan proceeds for creating fiscal space in a sustainable manner within a defined \nmedium-term fiscal framework. This is different from traditional program lending where funds \nare utilized for incremental sector spending, compensating for revenue shortfalls, or financing of \nother costs as a result of adjustment measures. This method was also used in ADB\u2019s Punjab \nResource Management Program. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n81.  Loan Amount and Terms. The federal Government has requested two loans equivalent \nto $130 million to help finance the BRMP. The first loan of \u00a512,076,350,000 ($110 million \nequivalent) (to support policy reforms) will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwith  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and program agreements. Interest rate and currency options may be exercised in \naccordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines. The second loan of SDR 13,580,000 ($20 million \nequivalent) (to support enhanced resource transfers to local governments) will be financed from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility and Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n82.  Program Costs. The total loan amount was determined taking into account the cost and \nstrength  of  the  structural  reforms  as  well  as  the  medium-term  fiscal  projections  and \nrequirements to implement the proposed reforms. The costs of structural adjustment for the \nBRMP  for  2005  and  2006  are  estimated  to  be  about  PRs11,505  million  or  $201  million \nequivalent, comprising the following components: \n \n(i)   strengthening  the  Accountant  General  Office  and  districts  account  offices \n(PRs800 million);  \n(ii)  training,  conducting  research  and  development,  and  providing  institutional \nsupport for water resources management (PRs1,280 million); \n(iii)  covering operation and management expenditures (including promoting efficient \nirrigation systems) (PRs995 million); \n(iv)  funding local government (PRs1,210 million); \n(v)  accelerating completion of core PSDP program (PRs2,100 million); \n(vi)  repaying short-term debt (including overdraft) (PRs2,600 million); \n(vii)  clearing pending contracted liabilities (PRs1,270 million); ", "    19 \n(viii)  funding pension liabilities and capitalization of provident fund (PRs800 million); \nand  \n(ix)  accelerating mineral development projects in Balochistan (PRs450 million). \n \n83.  Medium-term fiscal projections and costing details are in appendixes 5 and 6. Underlying \nassumptions of the fiscal framework are summarized in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n84.  Onlending to Balochistan. The federal Government will onlend the loan proceeds to \nBPG in domestic currency, at mutually agreed terms and conditions, comparable to those \naccorded to other provinces (i.e., North-West Frontier Province, Punjab, and Sindh) for similar \nadjustment programs. The federal Government will assume the foreign exchange risks, and \nBPG the interest rate risk. \n \n85.  Release in Two Tranches. The proceeds from each program loan will be available for \nwithdrawal in two tranches upon satisfactory compliance with agreed achievements (conditions) \nfrom the date of loan effectiveness and within 18 months from loan effectiveness, respectively. \nThe first tranche will be \u00a57,136,025,000 ($65 million equivalent). Upfront actions for the FY2005 \nbudget and nonbudget actions as agreed upon in the policy matrix are preconditions for loan \neffectiveness (Appendix 4).  \n \n86.  Counterpart Funds. The counterpart funds to be generated, in domestic currency, from \nthe loan proceeds will be used to finance the cost of structural adjustment, and to create fiscal \nspace. According to BPG\u2019s white paper in conjunction with the budget speech in June 2004, all \ncounterpart  funds  generated  out  of  the  ordinary  capital  resources  loan  will  be  used  to \nrestructure provincial debt by retiring high-interest cash development loans (CDLs). The federal \nGovernment and BPG will certify the utilization of counterpart funds in line with the Loan \nAgreement through audited statements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n87.  The counterpart funds generated from the Special Funds resources loan will be used to \nprovide the local service delivery grant to support development budget expenditures by district \nand tehsil local governments in services in accordance with their mandates under the BLGO \n2001. The grant will be administered by a PFC committee chaired by the secretary of finance, \nand will be operated according to rules, acceptable to ADB, that will be approved by PFC and \nannounced  before  loan  effectiveness.  Procedures  for  the  allocation,  budgeting,  planning, \nexpenditure,  and  accountabilities  for  this  grant  are  designed  to  provide  a  prototype  for \ndevelopment  grant  systems  for  inclusion  in  the  forthcoming  PFC  medium-term  award \n(Supplementary Appendix E). The fund design includes the following features: (i) assignment of \nbroad discretion to local councils to invest the funds for development activities; (ii) allocations \nmade  on  a  basic  formula  (e.g.,  population);  (iii)  eligibility  criteria  to  be  met  by  the  local \ngovernment before qualifying to draw on their formula entitlement; and (iv) performance criteria, \nto be met in process, by local governments to continue to receive tranches under the grant. The \neligibility and performance criteria administered by the PFC committee will be simple, few, and \npro-poor, and designed with the intention to not identify investments, but to promote observance \nby local governments of core accounting, planning, and expenditure management standards, \nconsistent with the Local Government Ordinance and related finance management regulations \nand codes.22 PFC will be responsible for monitoring and preparing reports on compliance with \nthe terms and conditions under which funds are made available to local governments. The \nrelevant line departments and any others whose policy mandate is included in the expenditure \n                                                 \n22  For example, Section 114 of the Local Government Ordinance provides the rules on anticorruption and public \naccess to information. ", "20    \nobjectives for the grant will be responsible for providing PFC with periodic reports on the grant\u2019s \nsector outputs. The Local Government Commission will be responsible for certifying that the \nlocal  governments  are  complying  with  all  requirements  attached  to  the  grant.  The  federal \nGovernment and BPG will certify the utilization of counterpart funds in line with the Loan \nAgreement through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management  \n88.  Implementation. BPG will be responsible for program implementation, financing, and \nmaintenance of the PMU for the BRMP, and the effective utilization of the counterpart funds \ngenerated from the loan proceeds; and will enter into a program agreement with ADB. The \nFinance Department will be the Executing Agency for the BRMP, the TA loan, and the TA \ngrants. The PMU for the BRMP will be merged with the existing Provincial Program Support \nOffice  under  the  DSP.  To  strengthen  ownership  early  on  in  the  process,  the  Finance \nDepartment  will  ensure  adequate  additional  staffing,  equipment,  and  rooms  prior  to  loan \nnegotiations. The terms and conditions of members of the extended PMU will be the same as \nagreed under ADB\u2019s DSP. The Finance Department will coordinate efforts of all implementing \nagencies to ensure that targeted achievements are met, will liaise with ADB on all program \nadministration matters, and inform the public on implementation progress through electronic \nlinks to the BRMP under BPG\u2019s web site. \n \n89.  Implementing  agencies  with  responsibilities  for  the  BRMP  are  the  departments  of \nagriculture, food, and cooperatives; education; finance; health; home and tribal; industries and \ncommerce; information technology; irrigation; local government and rural development; mines \nand  minerals;  planning  and  development;  public  health  engineering;  services  and  general \nadministration;  and  social  welfare;  as  well  as  the  Board  of  Revenue.  Each  will  have  full \nresponsibility for achievements in the PRAs within its mandate (Appendix 4). Responsibilities, \ndeliverables, and reporting requirements of the Finance Department, implementing agencies, \nand other agencies involved will be detailed in the program administration memorandum. The \nFinance  Department  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the  program \nadministration memorandum (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n90.  Program  Oversight  Arrangements.  Balochistan  is  embarking  on  a  major  reform \nprocess with the BRMP. The outcomes are highly complex and various provincial departments \nand local governments at the district and tehsil levels are involved. To achieve the necessary \nlevels of policy and program oversight a high-level steering committee will be constituted with a \ncomposition  similar  to  that  of  the  DSP.  The  committee  will  meet  as  needed,  but  at  least \nquarterly. Members of the steering committee include department secretaries, members of \npolitical parties, the private sector, business organizations, and civil society organizations. The \nextended PMU will be the secretariat for the steering committee.  \n \n91.  Coordination  with  Other  Reform  Initiatives  and  Consultations.  Balochistan  has \nmade  significant  commitments  to  national  reform  programs  supported  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment agencies, most notably the Access to Justice Program, DSP, and Gender Reform \nProgram, concerned in essence with improving service delivery. The BRMP is designed to \nstrengthen progress of these programs by fostering additional policy reforms. The BRMP is \nclosely coordinating and setting the holistic policy path for other proposed ADB investments. \nFurther information on other development-assisted projects is summarized in the development \ncoordination matrix (Appendix 3). ", "    21 \n \n92.  The reform process involves periodic and systematic consultations with nongovernment \nand  civil  society  groups.  To  foster  efficiency  and  sustainability,  the  BRMP  will  develop  a \ncommunication strategy to overcome the highly politicized nature of this important reform topic \nin  Balochistan.  The  communication  strategy  will  include  information  on  continuing  regular \ndialogue  with  organized  civil  society  and  workshops  on  components  of  the  BRMP  reform \nagenda  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  An  annual  Balochistan  development  forum  will  be \ninstitutionalized to allow for systematic civil society participation on the current reform agenda.  \n \n93.  Role of the Federal Government. The federal Government will be the borrower of the \nprogram loan and channel the funds from ADB to BPG. The Government will support the \nreprofiling of BPG\u2019s debt by facilitating early repayment of expensive domestic loans and will \nensure that BPG\u2019s overdraft with the SBP shall not exceed the amount reached as of 30 \nSeptember 2004, and that the overdraft is converted into a soft loan on terms to be agreed \nbetween the SBP and BPG. BPG will provide relevant information on implementation progress \nto facilitate monitoring of the utilization of the loan proceeds by the Government.  \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n94.  The  program  loans  will  follow  ADB  standard  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement. Proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs, \nexcluding local duties and taxes, of eligible imports23 produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s \nmember countries. Appendix 7 provides the list of ineligible items. All procurement under the \nprogram loans will be undertaken through normal commercial practices for the private sector or \nthe federal Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with due \nconsideration to economy and efficiency.  \n \n95.  Disbursements under the program loans will be made in line with ADB\u2018s simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  audit  requirements.24  To  withdraw  the  loan  proceeds,  the \nGovernment will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the program loans in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n3.  Monitoring and Tranching \n96.  Both  loans will  be  disbursed  in two  installments  based on  performance  in  meeting \nspecified  tranche  achievement  targets.  The  first  tranche  of  \u00a57,136,025,000  ($65  million \nequivalent)  for  the  ordinary  capital  resources  loan  will  be  made  available  upon  loan \neffectiveness and compliance with tranche 1 conditions. The second tranche is expected to be \nreleased  within  18  months  from  loan  effectiveness  upon  satisfactory  progress  in  meeting \nspecified achievement targets. The closing date for withdrawal for both loan accounts will be 31 \nDecember 2006. \n \n97.  The  first  tranche  of  SDR  6,790,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  of  the  Special  Funds \nresources loan will be made available upon loan effectiveness and compliance with the tranche \n1 conditions and other effectivness conditions as specified in the loan agreement. The second \n                                                 \n23  Eligible imports refer to total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, noneligible imports specified in \nthe list of ineligible items, and imports financed already by ADB or other international and bilateral development \nagencies.  \n24  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements of Program Loans. Manila.  ", "22    \ntranche is expected to be released within 18 months from loan effectiveness upon satisfactory \nprogress in meeting specified achievement targets. \n \n98.  To measure progress and assess compliance with the achievement targets, specific \nactions agreed to by the federal and provincial governments and ADB are indicated in the policy \nmatrix and detailed in the program administration memorandum. ADB and the federal and \nprovincial governments will maintain a continued dialogue throughout program implementation. \nA certain degree of flexibility in adjusting specific actions during program implementation may \nbe  accommodated  to  best  accomplish  the  achievements,  if  the  governments  can  credibly \ndemonstrate that the agreed achievements can be reached by alternative actions.  \n \n99.  To monitor BRMP implementation, BPG will prepare quarterly progress reports as well \nas an annual report on program implementation for submission to ADB, and regularly update \nthe program web site. ADB will send regular review missions and conduct semiannual reviews \njointly with BPG to evaluate compliance with the conditions and advise BPG on actions required \nto keep program implementation on course. Details on roles, responsibilities, and time frames\u2014\ntogether with the program monitoring and evaluation framework\u2014are described in the program \nadministration memorandum. \n \n4.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n100.  The federal and provincial governments will maintain separate accounts and records for \nthe loans, including separate budgets heads of accounts for each of the items of expenditure \nunder the BRMP in accordance with sound accounting principles. Relevant accounts will be \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  standards  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  BPG  will  provide \ncertified copies of the same to ADB promptly after their preparation but not later than 9 months \nafter the close of the fiscal year to which the accounts refer. Effective financial management is a \ncritical success factor for program sustainability. A financial management assessment including \na  review  of  the  executing/implementing  agencies\u2019  systems  for  financial  and  management \naccounting, reporting, auditing, and internal controls has been conducted.  \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT \nA.  Supporting Public Resource Management Reforms in Balochistan \n101.  Concept  and  Design  Principles.  To  develop  capacity  for  implementation  and \nsustainability of the BRMP reform agenda, the TA Project is proposed for supporting public \nresource management in Balochistan (Appendix 8). Since BPG is embarking on a process of \nwide-ranging policy and institutional reforms, the TA Project is designed to provide a targeted, \nflexible financing facility for TA over a longer period. The financing facility must have strong \nownership by the Finance Department to identify TA requirements; prepare scope/terms of \nreference;  oversee  and  manage  technical  inputs  provided;  and  determine  the  appropriate \nincorporation of the results. The TA Project will be financed in part through a TA loan funded by \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and in part supported through a grant from the Government of \nthe Netherlands. \n \n102.   Scope.  The  TA  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i)  support  assessments  and  analytical \nstudies in key policy and reform areas addressed under the BRMP; (ii) develop strategies to \nimprove fiscal sustainability and public service delivery; (iii) assess current data availability, and \nthen develop data collection and analysis systems to enhance development planning; (iv) build \ncapacity to carry out institutional reforms in key public sector departments including finance, ", "    23 \nirrigation, local government and rural development, and planning and development; (v) develop \na monitoring and evaluation system to monitor both intermediate indicators, and in the longer \nterm,  the  poverty  impacts  of  BRMP-related  reforms;  and  (vi)  develop  a  consultation  and \ncommunications strategy to engage stakeholders and to disseminate information on the reform \nprogram.  \n \n103.  The TA Project (through the Government of the Netherlands-funded component) will \nsupport  the  implementation  of  the  water  resources  management  policy  currently  under \npreparation for Balochistan. This component will also have a strong capacity-building element \nand focus on skills development of staff in key agencies responsible for water management, and \ninstitutional restructuring to make existing institutions more responsive to the needs of the \nsector. \n \n104.  Sequencing. The TA Project will finance the costs of technical/consulting services, \ncapacity  building,  and  related  inputs  of  a  shorter  term  nature  that  are  necessary  for \naccomplishment and sustainability of the agreed actions, and as may be periodically reviewed \nand mutually agreed by BPG and ADB. The TA Project will emphasize the mobilization of \nexpertise available within Pakistan to ensure sustainable capacity building of public resource \nmanagement. Similarly, capacity building to be supported under the TA Project will focus on \ntraining and skills development services that can be delivered by Pakistani private and/or public \nsector  institutions,  and  in  particular,  activities  that  can  be  integrated  within  the  normal \nfunctioning of the concerned client agencies.  \n \n105.  Implementation.  The  Finance  Department  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  TA \nProject\u2019s activities will be managed through the PMU consistent with the DSP annual planning \nand budgeting process. The various implementing agencies will be fully responsible for their \nrespective  components.  All  consultants,  including  for  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands; \ncomponent, will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nWhere firms are to be engaged, the quality-based selection method will be utilized for consultant \nselection, because of the emphasis on capacity building and hiring experienced consultants to \nwork  under  difficult  circumstances  in  less-developed  parts  of  Balochistan.  Approval  of  the \nPlanning Commission pro-forma II25 and establishment of the extended PMU are conditions to \nmake  this  TA  Project  effective.  Besides  regular  consultation  missions,  two  comprehensive \nreviews  will  be  undertaken  by  ADB,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  the \nconsultants, 12 and 24 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n106.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan. The total cost is estimated to be $6.56 million \nequivalent, comprising $1,305,000 in foreign exchange costs and $5,255,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency costs. The Government has requested a loan of SDR 2,037,000 ($3 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the TA Project. The loan will have a 32-\nyear term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \nloan and TA project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n                                                 \n25 The Planning Commission pro-forma II is the feasibility document for projects that do not have an investment \ncomponent.  ", "24    \n107.  The ADB loan will cover 45.73% of the total cost. The Government of the Netherlands \nhas indicated its intention to cofinance the TA Project on a parallel basis through a grant of \n$1.92 million or 29.27% of the total TA cost. BPG will finance the remaining $1.64 million \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs  or  25%  of  the  total  cost.  The  Government  of  the \nNetherlands will finance all foreign exchange costs and a portion of the local currency costs in \nconjunction  with  the  water  resources  component.  ADB  will  finance  the  remaining  foreign \nexchange and local costs of this component. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nprovided in Appendix 8.  \n \n108.  The federal Government will make the loan proceeds available to BPG in domestic \ncurrency, at mutually agreed terms and conditions, comparable to those accorded to other \nprovinces (i.e., North-West Frontier Province, Punjab, and Sindh) for similar TA. The federal \nGovernment will assume the foreign exchange risks, and BPG the interest rate risk. Loan \ncompletion is expected for 31 December 2007 and the loan closing date is 30 June 2008. \n \nB.  Strengthening Program Implementation \n109.  An advisory TA will augment the capacity for implementation and sustainability of the \nreform agenda under the BRMP. The TA will support capacity development within the PMU and \nthe implementing agencies. Further, measures will be supported to lead to enhanced policy \nanalysis (Supplementary Appendix G).  \n \n110.  The total costs of the TA including contingencies is estimated to be $500,000 million \nequivalent, of which ADB will finance $400,000 million equivalent on a grant basis from the \nADB-funded  TA  program,  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  part  of  the  local \ncurrency cost, mainly for domestic consultants. BPG\u2019s contribution comprises 20% of the total \nTA cost. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n111.  The BRMP outcomes will help BPG with its efforts to reduce poverty by embarking on a \nfirst set of broader policy reforms. Of utmost importance is the beginning of continuous dialogue \nbetween BPG and ADB on holistic policy reforms. A prime benefit will be the improvement of \npublic  policy  formulation  by  engaging  all  key  stakeholders.  Another  important  benefit  is  the \ndevelopment of the BRMP\u2019s monitoring and evaluation system, which will not only allow better \npoverty targeted monitoring but also the evaluation of outputs and outcomes for the benefit of \nfuture policy reforms. Policy reforms will enable improved public service delivery by creating \nfiscal resources that allow reprioritization of provincial expenditures and reforms in revenue \ngeneration  and  expenditure  management.  Improvements  in  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and \nperformance accountability of public sector agencies will reduce wastage and enable processes \nfor sustainable management of public resources. By streamlining public resource management, \nthe BRMP will create the fundamentals for more opportunities for private-sector-led growth and \nemployment generation.  \n \n112.  Identifiable benefits will accrue over the medium term in line with the outcomes detailed in \nthe program framework and policy matrix. Specific and immediate impacts will relate to fiscal \nrestructuring and utilization of loan proceeds for debt restructuring, which will create savings of as \nmuch as PRs1 billion per annum on debt servicing. This will be utilized for improved pro-poor \nservice delivery in line with the agreed medium-term fiscal framework. In addition, several specific ", "    25 \nactions directly targeting the poor are included in the policy matrix, such as creation of sustainable \nwater resources management, a pro-poor food subsidy policy, and improved public services \ntargeted at the poor.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n113.  The BRMP is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction by facilitating \ninstitutional processes. Impacts on labor markets, prices, net public transfers, and access to \npublic goods and services are expected to be positive in the long term. No significant adverse \nimpacts are directly associated with the BRMP. The BRMP will have a positive impact on \ngender by making BRG approval of the GRAP a precondition for the loans. The BRMP will \nsupport GRAP implementation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n9. A summary description on the poverty impact of the BRMP is in Supplementary Appendix H. \nIntegration of gender reforms under the BRMP is in Appendix 10. \n \n114.  The BRMP will have positive impacts on the environment by developing a strategy \nleading to sustainable water resources management, and developing a new tubewell policy. \nMeasures will be introduced to cap and phase out the tubewell subsidy by introducing an \nincentive  system  that  encourages  sustainable  water  usage.  The  BRMP  will  not  have  any \ninvoluntary resettlement components or any impact on indigenous people. \n \nC.  Risks \n115.  The  realization  of  program  benefits  and  impacts  will  depend  on  a  number  of \nassumptions that are subject to a variety of risks. Mitigating measures have been integrated in \nthe BRMP design as appropriate, taking account of past experiences in program lending in \nPakistan and elsewhere. \n \n116.  Political Risks. The political situation in Balochistan tends to be difficult. The coalition \ngovernment has a wide constituency to satisfy and therefore faces pressures. Secondly, some \nconflicts have arisen in building political consensus around large-scale development projects \ninitiated  by  the  federal  Government.  In  addition,  Balochistan\u2019s  borders  with  neighboring \ncountries are porous, smuggling is rampant and enforcement of law suffers by having separate \nand coexisting rules and enforcement systems in some parts of the province. These risks are \nexacerbated by the size and rugged terrain of the province, and the sparse and dispersed \npopulation, which makes administrative reach more difficult. \n \n117.  The BRMP will not be able to mitigate all these risks. Some of the risks, particularly \nthose related to the geopolitical aspects, are beyond the control of Balochistan and even the \nfederal Government. The BRMP will help BPG develop its governance infrastructure to mitigate \nsome of these risks. An essential part of the BRMP is continuous dialogue with stakeholders. \nThe BRMP includes a communication strategy, which began with water resources management \nissues (in particular on the tubewell reform) under the preparatory TA, and will be extended to \nall other reform areas of the BRMP to ensure continuity of support through all stakeholders. The \nBRMP achieved strong political backing through the budget speech and the white paper for \nFY2005 to overcome practices of approving unrealistic development schemes. Managing public \nresources in an efficient, transparent, accountable, and sustainable manner is an important \nprecondition to control political risks. \n \n118.  Governance and Bureaucratic Risks. There is a risk that some people will be resistant \nto the new transparent and accountable processes and will be reluctant to change systems. To ", "26    \nmitigate such risks, high-level support from the chief secretary and the high-level steering \ncommittee will be important. Further mitigation of risks is expected by undertaking special \naudits, making accounts and expenditures publicly available, and establishing public grievance \nmechanisms under the BRMP. \n \n119.  Institutional and Implementation Risks. Several programs and projects in Pakistan \nsuffer from implementation delays. Taking this into account, the BRMP builds on experiences of \na functioning PMU by merging program implementation with the DSP\u2019s Provincial Program \nSupport Office in Quetta. A detailed program administration memorandum will also assure the \nBRMP\u2019s focus not only on design but on detailed implementation. To further mitigate this risk \nthe BRMP will have a strong TA component focusing on capacity building to support program \nimplementation, and thereby build institutional capacity.  \n \n120.  Continuity  Risk.  Balochistan  has  a  very  high  overdraft  with  SBP.  Continuing  this \npractice without a clear-cut exit strategy will set disincentives for BPG to embark on holistic \nfiscal and financial management reforms. The BRMP incorporates the immediate freezing and \nreduction over time of the overdraft as part of overall fiscal consolidation. \n \n121.  Macroeconomic Risks. Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic parameters have been strong in the \npast 2 years. The initial broad policy reforms by the Government are beginning to show positive \nsigns. However, poverty levels remain too high and changes in that regard are indispensable. \n \n122.  The country remains highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks. To mitigate such risks to \nthe  extent  possible,  the  federal  Government  has  put  in  place  a  consistent  economic \nmanagement strategy that aims to reduce debt and help ensure fiscal stabilization. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n123.  In addition to the standard assurances, the federal Government and BPG have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)   Continuity of reform. BPG will carry out the policies and actions in accordance \nwith the schedule of policy reforms contained in the policy matrix as agreed upon \nby BPG and ADB, and ensure sustainability of the reforms beyond the program \nperiod. \n(ii)  Limit of the overdraft with the State Bank of Pakistan. The Borrower shall \nensure that Balochistan\u2019s overdraft with the State Bank of Pakistan shall not \nexceed the amount reached as of 30 September 2004, and that the overdraft is \nconverted into a soft loan on terms to be agreed between the State Bank of \nPakistan and Balochistan. \n(iii)   Local government funding. BPG will ensure that funding will be consistent with \nrespect  to  the  distribution  formula  announced  by  the  annual  PFC.  BPG  will \ninstitute performance-based grants and matching grants for preferential transfers \nfor priority policies in the next PFC award.  \n(iv)  Transparency and anticorruption measures. The Government and BPG each \nacknowledge that ADB, consistent with its commitment to good governance, ", "    27 \naccountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to  undertake,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  investigation  of  any  possible  financial  or  management \nimpropriety in the conduct of the program. The Government and BPG will each \ncooperate fully and ensure that each of BPG\u2019s agencies cooperates with any \nsuch investigation and extends all necessary assistance, including access to \nrelevant books and records.  \n(v)  Effective program management. BPG will take all steps and actions, including \nprovision of staff resources to ensure satisfactory completion in a timely manner \nof all program outputs. Program management for the BRMP will be merged with \nthe existing Quetta DSP office. The steering committee for the BRMP will be \ncomprised as for the DSP and provide policy and program oversight. The chief \nsecretary  will,  from  time  to  time,  provide  policy  guidance  to  the  steering \ncommittee. BPG will ensure that the Finance Department will be the Executing \nAgency and that the finance secretary will be responsible for coordination and \nmanagement of the BRMP and report to the chief secretary of the province and \nto the steering committee on implementation progress. BPG will implement the \nprogram and monitor and evaluate its performance in line with the program \nadministration memorandum as agreed with ADB.  \n(vi)  Support for Balochistan GRAP. BPG will provide continued policy and financial \nsupport  for  successful  implementation  of  the  Cabinet-approved  Balochistan \nGRAP.  BPG  will  take  proactive  measures  to  (i)  strengthen  the  Women \nDevelopment Department at the provincial and district level; (ii) implement cost-\nneutral reforms, such as reforms to increase women\u2019s employment in the public \nsector, and budgetary reforms; (iii) provide required budget allocations under \nrevenue and development budget as outlined in the GRAP, in the coming 3 \nbudget years; and (iv) establish incentive grants for women\u2019s development under \nPFC, as approved under the GRAP.  \n(vii)  Technical assistance. BPG will ensure that in carrying out the policy measures \nand activities included under the BRMP and the policy matrix, due consideration \nis given to the findings and recommendations of the TA project loan and TA \ngrants.  BPG  will  allow  ADB  to  provide  comments  on  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of the TAs, for consideration in policy measures for this and \nupcoming programs in Balochistan. BPG will make adequate funding provision \nfor timely TA implementation. \n(viii)  Environmental assessment. BPG will ensure that an appropriate environmental \nassessment will be undertaken for the integrated water resources management \npolicy.  \n(ix)  Counterpart funds. BPG will use the counterpart funds to be generated out of \nthe  proceeds  of  the  ordinary  capital  resources  loan in  domestic  currency  to \ncreate  sustainable  fiscal  resources  and  to  finance  the  cost  of  structural \nadjustment. Specifically, BPG will use the proceeds of the loan to restructure \nprovincial debt through retirement of high-interest cash development loans by at \nleast PRs6 billion, and any other cost directly related to the implementation of the \nBRMP.  ", "28    \n  BPG will use the counterpart funds to be generated out of the proceeds of the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  loan  to  finance  high-priority  social  and  human \ndevelopment programs by local governments targeted at the poor. Specifically, \nBPG will use the full fiscal resources from the loan created in each year of the \nBRMP to increase resource transfers to local governments through conditional \ngrants for local service delivery, and will publish annual performance review and \naudit on the transfers on the BPG website.  \n(x)  Coordination of reforms. The federal Government will ensure that adequate \ninformation is made available to BPG to facilitate consistency of fiscal projections \nwith the federal Government.

Balochistan\u2019s Socioeconomic Performance  \n \n1.  Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province by area, covering a total of 347,000 square \nkilometers (km), or 44% of Pakistan\u2019s land mass. However, it has only 6.6 million inhabitants (or \n5% of the country\u2019s total population) as per the 1998 census. This dichotomy has a number of \nimplications for the socioeconomic conditions in the province. With a population density of only \n19 persons per square kilometer, and a predominantly rural population (76.1% of the total), the \nprovince is characterized by the presence of small, scattered settlements, many of which are \nnot easily accessible. Estimates of incidence of poverty in the province are not very reliable due \nto data collection difficulties, but the Balochistan provincial government (BPG) estimated that in \n1999, at the height of the drought, 47% of the population was living below the poverty line.1 \n \n2.  The bulk of Balochistan\u2019s labor force (65%) is employed in agriculture, including crop \nagriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Livestock farming is the predominant activity within the \nsector,2 but following the 5-year drought that ended in 2002, only about a third of the total land \narea can be considered productive grazing land. The cultivated area is 2.11 million hectares (or \n10% of the total cultivated area in the country), and only 0.84 million hectares of land are \nirrigated. More than a third of the cultivated area is concentrated in four districts, which have \nirrigation systems. Although major crops such as wheat, rice, and cotton are grown, it is in \nhorticulture that the province has a comparative advantage, with fruit production estimated at \nabout 1.4 million tons annually. The province has a 770 km coastline, and the fisheries sector \nconstitutes an important subsector of agriculture, with production valued at about PRs1.4 billion \nannually. \n \n3.  The province has a very limited industrial base, with the manufacturing sector employing \nonly 3.4% of the population. Almost all industrial activity is concentrated in the district of \nLasbela, which borders Karachi. The district houses four industrial estates, while Quetta district \nhas two more. Occupancy levels in the industrial estates are extremely low (less than 5% in all \ncases). The potential for mining in Balochistan is considerable, given that 39 minerals are \ncurrently  being  mined  in  the  province,  and  commercial  deposits  of  an  additional 11 are \nestimated.3 Balochistan also supplies 70% of the country\u2019s estimated production of natural gas, \nthe bulk of it from the Sui gas fields. Overall, the province has been unable to attract investment \nbecause of lack of infrastructure, unavailability of skilled labor, and prevalence of a social \nsystem that encourages rent-seeking behavior on the part of local elites.  \n \n4.  Balochistan\u2019s  natural  environment  is  harsh,  with  an  arid  climate,  scarcity  of  water \nresources, and a rugged terrain for the most part. These factors have contributed to the low \npopulation density, and may also have played a part in the development of the entrenched tribal \nsystem that characterizes the sociocultural environment. The scattered population, heavily \ndependent on the patronage of local elites, has little access to social services, which are, in \nthese  circumstances,  expensive  to  provide  and  maintain.  As  a  result,  Balochistan\u2019s  social \nindicators consistently rank near the bottom in Pakistan, falling well below national averages in \nmost cases. In rural Balochistan, the literacy rate is estimated at 14% as compared with the \n                                                 \n1  Presentation at the Pakistan Development Forum, 2003. \n2  Although the bulk of the rural population is said to be involved in livestock farming, the subsector contributes an \nestimated 40% of total value added in the agriculture sector. Value added for the sector in Balochistan is skewed \nby the value added in horticulture, which employs relatively less people but is highly profitable. \n3  Data from ADB. 2003. Private Sector Assessment and Development Strategy. Manila.  ", " 36 Appendix 2 \nnational average of 29%.4 Overall literacy rate is 36% and female literacy rate is 16%, which \nagain is lowest in the country. Health indicators are similarly dismal, with infant mortality rates of \n108 per 1,000 live births, as compared with a national average of 100, and immunization \ncoverage of only 13%. \n \n5.   Balochistan has some of the worst social indicators in Pakistan. BPG finances are \ncharacterized  by  underspending  for  public  services,  and  a  serious  budget  deficit.  The \nsocioeconomic problems are underscored by an increasingly complex political situation.  \n \nB.   Institutional Framework and Government Responsibilities  \n \n6.  Constitutional Provisions. The allocation of responsibilities between the federal and \nprovincial governments is specified in the Fourth Schedule (under Article 4) of the Constitution \nof Pakistan of 1973. The Federal Legislative List sets out the functions to be performed by the \nfederal Government, while the Concurrent List delineates the functions that can be performed \neither by the federal or the provincial governments; although in the event of any conflict between \nthe legislation of the two tiers of government that of the federal Government prevails. Residual \nfunctions, not enumerated in either list, are the responsibility of the provinces.  \n \n7.  Federal Government Functions. According to the Federal Legislative List, the federal \nGovernment is responsible for regulatory as well as service functions. The service functions to \nbe performed by the federal Government include defense; external affairs; currency, coinage, \nand  legal  tender;  foreign  exchange;  foreign  loans  and  foreign  aid;  nuclear  energy;  stock \nexchanges;  national  planning  and  economic  coordination;  national  highways  and  strategic \nroads; geological and meteorological surveys; census; railways; exploitation of minerals and \nnatural gas; and development  of industries. In addition, the federal Government is currently \nperforming several of the functions specified in the Concurrent List.5The weak financial position \n \nof provincial governments and their overwhelming dependence on federal grants and transfers \ngreatly dilutes their ability to perform several of the functions in the Concurrent List. \n \n8.  Provincial Government Functions.  Functions not mentioned in either the Federal \nLegislative List or the Concurrent List are the responsibility of the provincial governments. \nProvinces  have  sole  responsibility  for  law  and  order,  justice,  provincial  highways,  urban \ntransport, secondary and university education, agriculture extension and provision of inputs, \nirrigation and land reclamation, industries, and mineral resources. The provinces undertake \nsome of the functions in the Concurrent List, including social welfare, labor exchanges, training \nestablishments, and management of ancient and historical monuments and sites. \n   \n9.  Local  Government  Functions  and  Decentralization  Reforms.  In  August  2001, \nfollowing a year of local elections, the Government implemented the local government plan \n(announced a year earlier) and created three levels of local governments entailing political, \nfinancial, and administrative devolution. Balochistan has 27 district governments, 73  tehsil \nmunicipal administrations (TMAs), and 518 union administrations to function as autonomous \nlocal bodies with their own responsibilities, financial shares, and revenue sources. District \n                                                 \n4  Bureau of Statistics, Planning and Development Department. 2004. Development Statistics of Balochistan, 2000\u2013\n2001. Quetta. \n5  This  includes  population  planning  and  social  welfare;  labor  exchanges;  training  establishments;  electricity; \nconservation of ancient and historical monuments and sites; curriculum, syllabus planning, running centers of \nexcellence, and standards of education; and tourism. \n ", "  Appendix 2    37\ngovernments were made responsible for schools, colleges, and district health services; and \nTMAs for water supply and waste disposal, in coordination with the union administrations. The \nBalochistan Local Government Ordinance 2001 provides the basic political and administrative \nframework. District governments are independent local governments, while TMAs and union \nadministrations  have  been  designated  as  autonomous  corporate  bodies.  These  new \nresponsibilities require changes in the provincial structures for these services and entail a \nprocess of transfer of human and financial resources from the province to local governments, as \nwell as a series of amendments for relevant laws, rules, systems, procedures, and processes. \nGiven the complexity of the task, the transfer of powers is still evolving. The new mandates \nclearly posed many challenges for the newly created local governments, which were faced with \nheightened public expectations on the one hand and large capacity gaps to handle these \nresponsibilities, on the other. The new structure has shaken up administrative relationships, \nincluding placement of the local administration under an elected council headed by a nazim, and \nrelative  autonomy  of  local  governments  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  provincial  government.  The  role  of \nprovincial line departments in policy making, regulation, standard setting, quality control, and \nmonitoring has still not been brought in conformity with the local government legislation and \nprovincial rules of business amended accordingly. The development budgets, administrative \napproval, technical sanction, and personnel management powers have not been transferred. \nTensions  between  provincial  and  local  elected  representatives,  and  between  district \ngovernments and TMAs need to be diffused. While this new setup will take time to strengthen \nand consolidate, it also needs to be given a fair chance by the provincial authorities and \nprovided the means to mature and demonstrate its potential. \n \n10.  The local government system is based on the premise that locally managed basic \nservices will improve responsiveness to local needs and facilitate improved service delivery, as \nit  provides  a  range  of  opportunities  for  enhancing  political  commitment  and  greater \naccountability to the public. During the first 3 years, public service delivery performance showed \nsigns  of  improvement,  although  with  great  variation  among  districts.  Councilors  report \nimprovement in staff attendance, staff report improved supplies, and several nazims emphasize \nthe importance of operations above new civil works. The expected problems exist\u2014political \ntransfer of staff, and non-merit-based recruitment of staff and site selection for facilities. The \ndistrict government budget barely covers the expenses for the fixed obligations to operate the \nexisting services transferred to them. District governments have little control over provincial staff \nand staff transfers. No allocations have been forthcoming to the new local governments from the \ndevelopment budget. Despite issues of release of funds and procedural constraints, use of \nwhatever funds are available with local governments can be considered satisfactory in most \nplaces. Very few capacity-building activities have been undertaken and most of this capacity \nbuilding  has  so  far  concentrated  on  the  district  governments,  while  TMAs  and  union \nadministrations  have  received  little  attention.  Under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-\nsupported Decentralization Support Program (DSP) and other external assistance, efforts are \nunder way to improve the capacity of local  governments. Special efforts are being made to \nimprove financial management and the audit trail for tracking expenditures.

The federal transfers received by the BPG include share of taxes from the divisible pool, \ndirect transfers mostly on account of natural gas, and subventions. The budget estimates for \nfiscal year (FY) 2004 in respect of these transfers, are provided in Table A1. \n ", " 38 Appendix 2 \nTable A1: Revenues from Federal Transfers, Balochistan Provincial Government \n \n  Estimates 2004 \nItem  (PRs million) \nDirect Transfer  7,225.1 \nRoyalty on Natural Gas  1,832.3 \nExcise Duty on Natural Gas  1,177.1 \nSurcharge on Gas  4,090.4 \nProvincial General Sales Tax     125.2 \nGrants  6,001.3 \nFederal General Sales Tax (2.5%)   946.5 \nSubventions for 2001\u20132002  4,804.8 \nOther     250.0 \nShared Taxes  9,018.5 \nTotal  23,693.1 \n  Source: Balochistan Provincial Government. 2003. White Paper, Budget 2003\u201304. Quetta. \n \n12.  Currently, the divisible pool is distributed on the basis of population. The weakness in \nusing population as the sole criterion is that although all development is about and for people, \nsuggesting that all citizens of Pakistan should be treated equally, population density is not the \nsame across provinces and all provinces are not starting from similar initial positions of service \nprovision. The minimum overhead and administrative cost of providing a service is based on an \nacceptable standard of service delivery. Balochistan with its scattered and sparsely populated \nsettlements has to bear a higher unit cost for providing services. BPG\u2019s viewpoint is that since \nthe province has a low population density, a high level of poverty and backwardness (in terms of \nprovision of infrastructure like roads, electricity, health, and education services), and a large \nland mass, a purely population-based allocation of the divisible pool puts the province at a \ndistinct disadvantage. \n \n13.  Under  the  1997  National  Finance  Commission  award,  BPG  has  been  receiving \nsubvention grants to cater for the province\u2019s special development needs. The problem with this \napproach is that no agreed criteria have been established to set the level of subvention. As a \nresult, BPG has little leverage in negotiating for a specific amount in the form of subvention. \nWhile some indexation of the basic amount deals with inflation, the criteria for setting the basic \namount as well as negotiating raises is not clearly specified, affecting the predictability and \ncertainty  of  resource  flows  from  the  federal  Government.  An  adjustment  of  the  formula, \nacknowledging BPG\u2019s position, would improve the volume and predictability of BPG\u2019s share in \nthe divisible pool. \n \n14.  BPG  also  receives  direct  transfers  from  the  federal  Government  because  of  its \nownership of gas. These transfers relate to the excise duty and royalty on gas, and its share of \nthe gas development surcharge (GDS). The excise duty on gas is based on production volumes \nand is set at a low rate (of PRs5.30 per British thermal unit) established several years ago. The  \nGovernment sets the rate and collects the tax, and then transfers the respective shares to the \nprovinces. With no role in the process, BPG cannot influence the Government\u2019s policy. \n \n15.  The royalty on gas recognizes the ownership right of the province. The GDS is based on \nthe cost of exploration and the stock of assets. The royalty on gas is fixed at the rate of 12.5% \nof the gas sold and valued at the wellhead  price. BPG\u2019s view is that the wellhead price is \npitched at a low level for the province\u2019s gas fields, compared with the royalty being paid on gas \nfields discovered recently, with much higher wellhead prices. An adjustment is required in favor ", "  Appendix 2    39\nof Balochistan by transferring to it the difference between royalty at market price and the \nwellhead price for fields that are on the cost-plus formula. \n \n16.  The federal Government levies the GDS as a consumer tax, ostensibly to raise funds for \ndevelopment and to absorb fluctuations in tariffs. It was first distributed among the provinces \nunder the 1991 National Finance Commission award. Presently, the GDS distribution is based \non the volume contributed by different gas fields to the total national gas supply, despite the fact \nthat the GDS collected is a function of the difference between the weighted prescribed price \n(determined on the basis of the wellhead price, operation and maintenance cost, excise duty, \netc.) and the price paid by the consumer. BPG\u2019s gas fields are mature and are fast depleting, \nwhich has resulted in the reduction of its share in the GDS. BPG argues that since the wellhead \nprice for Balochistan fields is low, its contribution margin, per unit of gas, to the total GDS is \nmore than the contribution of gas fields in other provinces. By allocating GDS receipts on the \nbasis of volume rather than total value of gas sold (being the product of volume and average \nweighted  price  paid  by  the  final  consumers),  BPG\u2019s  share  is  being  artificially  depressed. \nWhereas it contributes 53% to 65% under different formulas, it is presently getting a share of \nroughly 35% in the GDS distributed between the provinces. If the federal Government accepted \nBPG\u2019s argument, its share in total GDS of approximately PRs15 billion would be approximately \n65%,  roughly  PRs9.75  billion  instead  of  the  present  PRs4.8  billion  budgeted  in  FY2004. \nMoreover, PRs3 million to 4 billion is also due to Balochistan for the difference in GDS payable \nby gas producers on an accrual basis and the liability discharged by them to date. \n \nD.   Fiscal Restructuring and Financial Management \n \n17.  Balochistan has an extremely narrow revenue base and is heavily dependent on the \nfederal Government for resource transfers, generating on an average only 5% of its total \nbudgetary resources. In a province where private sector activity is negligible, the public sector is \nunder increasing pressure to provide employment. The flow of resources into Balochistan \nincreased significantly after the change of government in October 1999. Several megaprojects \nwere initiated after 2000, including the development of the Gwadar Port, Coastal Highway, \nMirani Dam, and Kacchi Canal. These projects are estimated to have collectively put over \nPRs140 billion into the provincial economy. However, all of these projects are federally funded, \nand have therefore not translated into flows into the provincial exchequer. \n18.  BPG has been particularly lax in financial management in the last year, due to its \nexpectations regarding fund transfers from development agencies, as well as positive outcomes \nunder the new National Finance Commission award, which was expected to be finalized before \nthe end of FY2004. Neither of these expectations was realized, due to the requirements of the \nprocessing cycles for foreign aid in the first instance, and due to the inability of the federal and \nprovincial governments to reach a consensus in the second. \n \n19.  BPG is entitled to draw PRs700 million in a fiscal year from the State Bank of Pakistan \non concessional terms to meet unforeseen expenditures. Given their expectations regarding \nincreased  revenues,  BPG  announced  the  Public  Sector  Development  Program  (PSDP)  of \nPRs8.5 billion for FY2004, and proceeded to implement the program without securing additional \nrevenues. When increased revenues did not materialize, BPG was forced to resort to taking \noverdrafts from the State Bank of Pakistan to meet current expenditures, and is estimated to \nhave  an  overdraft  of  over  PRs5  billion  as  of  end  June  2004.6 This situation is obviously \nunsustainable and has serious implications for fiscal stability in the province. \n                                                 \n6  Finance Minister's Budget Statement, 23 June 2004. ", " 40 Appendix 2 \n \n20.  Resource Mobilization. Restructuring of some key taxes and nontax measures will lead \nto positive gains in the medium term. \n \n21.  Property  Tax.  The  receipts  from  property  tax  in  FY2004  are  estimated  at  PRs37 \nmillion\u2014essentially  from  rented  properties  and  commercial  establishments.  The  small \ncontribution from this tax (receipts from which, under the Local Government Ordinance, are to \nflow to TMAs) is partly owing to its constricted base in view of the exemption available to owner-\noccupied houses, irrespective of its size. BPG could modify the exemption to protect citizens \nwith smaller urban dwellings, while taxing those residing in larger houses, thereby generating \nrevenues to finance operation and maintenance of infrastructure within the TMAs\u2019 jurisdictions. \nProperty  tax  receipts  are  expected  to  finance  the  provision  and  maintenance  of  local \ninfrastructure and other services, with  lower yield affecting the quality of service provision. \nTherefore, the exemption, granted by BPG, directly affects revenues from the most productive \nand buoyant tax available to local governments. The existing system also allows too much \ndiscretion to the officials of the Excise and Taxation Department in determining the annual rental \nvalue, which is the basis for taxation, thereby providing opportunities for corruption. \n \n22.  However, the Excise and Taxation Department has established a better tax structure for \ncommercial  properties  than  other  provinces.  Both  rented  and  self-occupied  commercial \nproperties pay the same rate of tax. Another issue is that the Excise and Taxation Department is \nusing reported values on property transfers to determine the stamp duty amount, as opposed to \nusing valuation tables as is done in other provinces. \n \n23.  Stamp Duty. In Balochistan, stamp duty on property transfers7 (which raised PRs101 \nmillion in FY2004) is levied at the rate of 5% of the value indicated on the sale deed. This gives \nincentives for underreporting the value at which the property is being exchanged. Like other \nprovinces that use valuation tables to get around the issue of underreporting, BPG amended its \nStamp Duty Act in March 2001 to enable stamp duty to be levied on transfers of property on the \nbasis of valuation tables. However, this provision has not been invoked, to date, in assessing \nthe stamp duty payable on such transactions. \n \n24.  Motor-Vehicle Related Taxes. Motor-vehicle related taxes (such as the registration fee \nand token/road tax) are an important revenue source. These taxes are levied at much lower \nrates in Balochistan than in other provinces. BPG justifies this difference on the grounds that the \nroads  in  Balochistan  are  in  very  poor  condition  thereby  weakening  the  political  case  for \nincreasing the road tax. The Government also feels that if rates are raised, a large proportion of \nthe population of heavy vehicles plying between Sindh and Balochistan may prefer registration \nin Sindh. In addition, the incidence of nonregistration of cars is likely to rise if rates are revised \nupward, as a significant number of cars are smuggled into the province. Since 25% of token tax \ngoes to the respective district government in Balochistan, any increase in rates, without even \nequating them to ones in the Punjab, could significantly enhance revenues of local governments \nfor financing the provision and maintenance of the road network.  \n \n25.  Professional Tax. By levying PRs50 per person as professional tax on commercial \nvehicles and income tax assesses (a rate fixed as far back as 1994), BPG collects PRs1 million \nper annum. Since, there is no database sharing with the Central Board of Revenue to identify \npotential taxpayers, government employees end up paying the bulk of the professional tax, \nsuggesting that the potential for professional tax has not been fully exploited. Though, in \n                                                 \n7  Lowered from the rate of 6% applicable up to FY2000. ", "  Appendix 2    41\nprinciple, professional tax should be eliminated and the net of general sales tax (a provincial \ntax) should be extended to services, this requires federal Government approval. \n \n26.  Agricultural Income Tax. Persistent drought and the indifferent political commitment to \ntaxation of agricultural incomes constrains revenue generation from this source. The potential \nfor taxation from orchards is much more than from food grains and cash crops, which requires \nBPG to conduct studies on the potential of agricultural income tax from different crops in canal-\nirrigated, rain-fed, and tubewell-irrigated areas, and on the most efficient and administratively \nconvenient mode of its collection. \n \n27.  Tariff on Irrigation Water. The water tariff for irrigation (abiana) covers barely 20% of \nthe cost of service provision. The assessed abiana per annum for Pat Feeder is about PRs40 \nmillion, and for Keerthar PRs20 million, whereas recovery is only PRs12 million (resulting in a \ncumulative outstanding amount of PRs340 million), compared with PRs70 million (40%) until \nonly a few years ago and as high as 60% in the late 1980s and 90% in the early 1990s. \nMoreover, no abiana is levied on 353 minor canals and around 75 flood irrigation schemes that \nirrigate 200,000 acres. With assessed value of PRs60 million for the system (based on 60% \ncropping intensity of wheat and rice, compared with the actual cropping intensity of 120%), an \n80% recovery rate could at least cover the operation and maintenance cost of service provision. \n \n28.  Royalties.  Whereas  the  federal  Government  sets  royalties  on  oil  and  gas,  BPG \nestablishes rates of royalties for all other minor minerals. Royalties involve two issues: (i) the \nrate, and (ii) the collection mechanism. The royalties on minor minerals have been set at fairly \nlow rates to encourage mining. To reduce leakage and underreporting the Minerals Department \nhas devised a mechanism for auctioning rights for royalty collection, which will be implemented \nfrom FY2005. The highest bidders will have the right to staff check posts and levy royalty \ncharges at the rates set by BPG. They will also be provided necessary support from law \nenforcement agencies for collecting royalty payments. \n \n29.  Consumption of liquor attracts a consumer fee of PRs500 per application (entitling the \nconsumer  to  a  monthly  permit  of  8  units/bottles  and  a  permit  fee  of  PRs125  per  bottle. \nBreweries pay an annual license fee of PRs200,000, a distillery license fee and a still head duty \nof PRs100 per gallon and PRs5 per liter of beer, while shops are required to pay an assessment \nfee of PRs420 per gallon.   \n \n30.  Expenditure  Management.  A  discussion  of  some  key  issues  in  expenditure \nmanagement in the province follows. \n \n31.  Agricultural Tubewell Subsidy. The subsidy on agricultural tubewells is not only open-\nended (i.e., no ceiling on the maximum level of subsidy per tubewell), it also does not provide an \nincentive to farmers to either conserve energy or save scarce water resources. Farmers are \nrequired to pay a fixed charge of PRs4,000 per month per tubewell, irrespective of the number \nof hours of tubewell operation (which they do not pay regularly, complaining about frequent load \nshedding and the unreliable supply of electricity that also damages their transformers). BPG \ncovers 30% of the remaining charges of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) \nfor electricity consumed by tubewells, the federal Government (40%), with WAPDA absorbing \nthe balance (30%). The Irrigation Department estimates that the groundwater table in these \nareas has been falling by approximately 20 to 25 feet per year, since the groundwater aquifer is \nnot being recharged regularly. \n ", " 42 Appendix 2 \n32.  The tubewell subsidy needs to be redesigned to create an incentive for adoption of \nmodern and efficient irrigation systems. The reform needs to shift the marginal cost of using \nwater and electricity to the farmer. The reform also needs to shift the incentive of collection of \ntariff to WAPDA. Right now WAPDA has no incentive to meter tubewells and collect payment \nfrom the farmer. Currently, the subsidy is about PRs1.5 billion for some 14,000 tubewells. \n \n33.  Wheat Subsidy. BPG\u2019s issue price of wheat from its stocks is below the market price of \nwheat8 and does not cover the full cost it incurs on its bagging, transportation, storage,9 and \nfinancing. The subsidy for wheat is a general subsidy and is not targeted to the needy. The main \nbeneficiaries are the owners of flourmills and the functionaries of the Food Department. Since \nBalochistan has an extensive border with Afghanistan, a wheat deficit country, the possibilities \nof smuggling further reduces the effectiveness of the subsidy. The price differentials are large \nand the border is fairly porous, so much of the subsidy accrues to unintended beneficiaries. The \nsubsidy costs BPG about PRs1 billion every year. \n \n34.  Debt Liabilities. The total debt liability of the province, at the end of FY2003 was \nPRs38.3 billion, PRs43.7 billion if the overdraft of the State Bank of Pakistan at the end of May \n2004 is also included. Of this debt PRs21 billion comprised foreign loans, with PRs11.3 billion \noutstanding to the World Bank, PRs8.3 billion to ADB, and PRs1 billion to International Fund for \nAgricultural Development. The balance represents bilateral aid. \n \n35.  BPG's stock of rupee loans mainly comprise PRs12 billion of cash development loans \nextended by the federal Government. The interest on PRs10.1 billion of these loans is at a rate \nhigher than 14.5% per annum, of which PRs6.3 billion are at interest rates ranging from 15.1% \nto 17% and PRs0.76 billion at interest rates above 17%. The servicing cost of all loans was \nPRs2.6 billion in FY2004 (of which PRs2.3 billion were on account of cash development loans), \nabsorbing 10.7% of its total current expenditure (compared with actuals of 15% to 16% in earlier \nyears). \n \nE.   Development Expenditure and Resource Allocation \n \n36.  Unsustainable Development Program. Despite the magnitude and extended range of \nthe PSDP, BPG is continuing to expand the size of its development portfolio. This is especially \ninappropriate considering that the bulk of the social sector schemes in the PSDP should fall \nwithin the purview of the district governments, and should have been identified and executed by \nthem. For the health sector, PRs168.9 million for ongoing and new schemes from the health \nsector PSDP allocation  of PRs688.2 million (24.5%), PRs1,081 million of education sector \nPSDP of PRs1,173.8 million (92.1%), and PRs309.3 million for water supply out of PSDP \nallocation  of  PRs544.7  million  (56.8%)  pertained  to  functional  mandates  of  the  local \ngovernments. These schemes should have been identified, designed, and implemented by the \nlocal governments. \n \n37.  Similarly, 20% of the PSDP represents block grants that are not subjected to any \nscrutiny and do not necessarily fall into an overall development framework. For FY2004 these \nblock allocations totaled PRs795 million, or 5.5% of the total PSDP. These allocations need to \nbe rationalized. For block allocations for neglected and priority areas, the criterion for scheme \n                                                 \n8  In January 2004 BPG charged PRs875 per 100 kilogram (kg) compared with the market price of PRs1,200 per 100 \nkg. BPG following a policy of accelerated cascading is raising the issue price by PRs10 per month per 100 kg. \n9  BPG maintained a 3-month strategic reserve of a maximum of 300,000 metric tons determined on the basis of a \npopulation of 7 million requiring 10 kg/person per month. ", "  Appendix 2    43\nselection should be explicitly stated and made transparent, thereby reducing the discretionary \npowers  of  officials  and  politicians  in  the  utilization  of  block  allocations.  For  other  block \nallocations, BPG should consider withdrawing some of them. \n \nF.   Provincial Finance Commission  \n  \n38.  The Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) award for FY2005 allocates PRs8.61 billion \nas provincial allocable in addition to passing on PRs1.78 billion to local governments as 2.5% \nshare of general sales tax received from the federal Government. The local governments thus \nare expected to receive a total of PRs10.39 billion during the fiscal year, compared with total \nactual transfers of PRs10.78 billion during FY2004. In the PFC award FY2004, the shares \nallocated to district governments resulted in a shortfall for budgeted salaries in 22 of the 26 \ndistricts, therefore an additional PRs1.82 billion had to be transferred to local governments to \nmeet this shortfall and a mandatory 15% salary increase. However despite these additional \ntransfers, three district governments were unable to meet their budgeted salary expenditures, \nwhile five others barely met their budgeted salaries. \n \n39.  The PFC method of fixing the provincial allocable according to the previous years\u2019 actual \nsalary expenditure takes into account neither the vacant positions in the local governments nor \nthe new positions to make operational the new or hitherto nonfunctional facilities. A salary \nincrease of 15% effective 1 July 2004 has also to be taken into account. Only a bare minimum \nof  nonsalary  expenditure  is  provided  to  local  governments,  and  repair  and  maintenance \nexpenditure for devolved functions and operational costs of water supply schemes continue to \nbe included in the provincial recurrent budget. No development funds from the PSDP are \nprovided to the local governments. \n \n40.  The PFC award needs to consider the functional mandates of the local governments to \ndetermine allocation of resources consistent with their expenditure assignments. Further, to \nenable local governments to meet their obligations, administrative and financial authority needs \nto be devolved, and their managerial and technical capabilities strengthened. The ADB-funded \nDecentralization Support Program is supporting capacity-building activities including those with \nregard to financial management and accounting related functions. \n \nG.   Financial Management \n \n41.  Accountant General's Office. The province has only two district account offices, one in \nQuetta and the other in Lasbela, while the accountant general has suboffices in Khuzdar and \nSibi. Other districts have treasury officers, reporting to the provincial Finance Department, with \nno  responsibility  to  maintain  accounts.  However,  they  send  their  paid  vouchers  to  the \naccountant general office in Quetta for preparing civil accounts, a task that, in view of the \ndistances involved and the inadequate number of staff, it performs with a lag of 2 months. \n \n42.  Some districts (for example Awaran, Kila Saifullah, Ziarat) that do not have a bank or the \nbranch of the National Bank has not been authorized to function as a bank for handling \ngovernment accounts and transactions. Hence, in these districts, all business is conducted in \ncash. For some districts, the travel time to and from Quetta is more than a day, because \ncommunication facilities are poor. There is also a dearth of motor vehicles. All these factors \nhinder regular inspections and field visits of accountant general office staff, creating problems in \nmaintaining appropriate controls over expenditures, tracking of transactions, and carrying out \nreconciliation of accounts in a timely manner. Similarly the auditing function continues to suffer ", " 44 Appendix 2 \nfor  the  reasons  pertaining  to  inadequate  human  resource  capability,  weak  communication \nfacilities, etc.   \n \n43.  To improve financial discipline, the effectiveness of public expenditures, the quality of \nprovincial accounts, debt and quasi-fiscal management (covering off-budget public accounts), \ntransparency,  and  public  accountability  systems,  BPG  has  adopted  the  national  financial \nmanagement  reforms  being  championed  by  the  federal  Government  proposed  under  the \nPakistan Improvement of Financial Reporting and Accounting (PIFRA) project. The accountant \ngeneral Office in Quetta is one of the pilot projects under this project. Also, computerization of \npayroll is being planned for implementation in 6\u20138 districts over the next 2 to 3 years. \n ", "Appendix 3  45\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX1  \n \n     \nAsian Development Bank  Other Multilateral Agencies  Bilateral Agencies \n     \n     \nProvide assistance to  World Bank   Royal Netherlands Embassy \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda  Support to agriculture, education,  Provide funding for the World \nto instill good governance  environment, governance, health,  Conservation Union Balochistan for \nacross the board, including  and infrastructure at the  4 years; its main focus is on \nmanagement of development  provincial level  environment protection and water. \nprocess, public resource and  Provide support and fund projects \n \nexpenditure; transparency  related to governance specifically in \nand accountability of  United Nations Development  the areas of devolution, justice, \neconomic policies;  Programme (UNDP)   gender, capacity building, and \nstrengthening of institutions,  reproductive health program for 2.1 \nFund Area Development \nsystems, and capacity; and  million euros from 1998 to 2004. \nProgramme Balochistan in 8 \npromotion of local \ndistricts: Laralai/Musa Khel,   \nparticipation and ownership. \nKalat, Killa Saifullah, Khuzdar, \nProvide support to the  United States Agency for \nMustung, Pishin, Quetta, and \nGovernment\u2019s poverty  International Development \nZiarat.

Background and Rationale \n \n1.  The Government of Pakistan has demonstrated strong commitment to poverty reduction, \nas manifested in the finalization of a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) paper in December \n2003. PRS documents have similarly been prepared by each of the four provinces including \nBalochistan. The poverty reduction initiative in the provinces has assumed greater significance \nas a result of the implementation of the Devolution Plan, which came into effect with the \npromulgation of the Local  Governance  Ordinance  in  August  2001.  The  Local  Government \nOrdinance 2001 fundamentally changed the structure of administration in the country, devolving \nresponsibilities for public service delivery to local governments, with the provincial governments \nbeing given the responsibility of overseeing performance, providing the broad policy framework \nwithin which local governments are to operate, and monitoring progress to attaining social \nsector targets. Devolution was also supposed to enhance accountability of service providers, \nand encourage greater participation of stakeholders.  \n \n2.  As  the  devolution  of  administrative  and  financial  powers  proceeds,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  support  the  Balochistan  provincial  government  (BPG)  in \nimplementing comprehensive reforms to restructure provincial finances; strengthen institutional \narrangements; and develop incentive mechanisms for public service delivery, private sector \ndevelopment, and water resources management. Implementation of the reform agenda poses \nconsiderable  challenges  that  require  substantial  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  both \nstrengthening  the  capability  to  further  detail  and  fine-tune  the  reforms,  as  well  as  build \nimplementation capacity in key provincial agencies.  \n \n3.  To  develop  capacity  for  implementation  and  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  reform \nprocess,  a  TA  project  loan  is  proposed  for  supporting  public  resource  management  in \nBalochistan. Since BPG is embarking on a process of wide-ranging policy and institutional \nreforms,  the  TA  is  designed  to  provide  a  targeted,  flexible  financing  facility  for  technical \nassistance. \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope \n \n4.  The objectives of the TA are to (i) support assessments and analytical studies in key \npolicy and reform areas addressed under the Balochistan  Resource Management Program \n(BRMP; (ii) develop strategies to improve fiscal sustainability and public service delivery; (iii) \nassess current data availability, and then develop data collection and analysis systems to \nenhance development planning; (iv) build capacity to carry out institutional reforms in key public \nsector departments including planning and development, finance, irrigation, local government \nand  rural  development;  (v)  develop  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  monitor  both \nintermediate indicators, and in the longer term, the poverty impacts of BRMP-related reforms; \nand (vi) develop a consultation and communications strategy to engage stakeholders and to \ndisseminate information on the reform program. \n \n5.  The TA will comprise nine components: (i) public expenditures/subsidies; (ii) revenue \nenhancement; (iii) financial management; (iv) service delivery issues; (v) local government \nfinancing issues; (vi) consultation, public-private partnership, and civil society engagement; (vii) \nadministrative frameworks; (viii) water resources management; and (ix) implementation support, \nincluding monitoring and evaluation.  \n   ", " 62 Appendix 8 \n \n6.  Public Expenditure/Subsidies. This component has implications for six key result \nareas, and will primarily inform policy making on enhancing the efficacy of public expenditure to \nmaximize  pro-poor  impacts  and  remove  structural  rigidities.  The  component  will  also  (i) \ncontribute to enhancing transparency in public resource management by ensuring widespread \ndissemination, and simplification of the information content of budget documents; (ii) provide \nsupport for developing implementable policy in the area of effective targeted subsidy schemes \n(for example, tubewells and atta); (iii) support reform of procurement processes with a view to \nmaking the procurement of goods and services more efficient and transparent; (iv) help review \nthe legal implications of expenditure-related reforms; and (v) support further poverty impact \nassessments for pro-poor policy schemes.  \n \n7.  Revenue Enhancement. The second component of the TA is intended to enable BPG \nto design and implement administrative reforms in tax administration, with a view to increase the \nrevenue base. This component will be utilized to review and recommend necessary changes in \ntax structures of key taxes to enhance revenue, in addition to assessing revenue collection \nmechanisms from nontax sources, and making recommendations on how to increase yields \nfrom these sources to move to greater cost recovery. This component of the TA will also \nexamine the structure of revenue collecting agencies and consider ways of improving their \nperformance, possibly by effecting change in functions, objectives, mission statements, and \nrules of business. It will further support review of organizational setup, staffing and incentives, \nas well as computerization and recording systems.  \n \n8.  Financial Management. Under this component, assistance will be provided to BPG for \nimproving accounting and auditing systems to ensure that accounts are prepared in a timely \nmanner, are reliable, and are publicly accessible, at all levels of government. The TA will also \nassist BPG to assess contingent liabilities, and recommend ways of financing these liabilities. In \naddition, this component of the TA will work to improve the concerned departments\u2019 capacities \nto  develop  PSDP  budget  allocations  for  pro-poor  development  schemes  and  develop \nperformance standards and norms agreed and used in the planning and monitoring of services \nand administrative systems.  \n \n9.  Service Delivery Issues. The TA will support both governmental and nongovernment \nagencies to bring about perceptible improvements in public service delivery by exploring the use \nof  innovative  service  delivery  mechanisms  using  modalities  of  public-private  partnership, \ncontracting  out  of  certain  service  delivery  functions,  and  other  such  mechanisms.  This \ncomponent of the TA will seek to first identify feasible alternatives, and then work with BPG to \ninstitutionalize such mechanisms. It will assist local governments in analyzing their performance \nagainst agreed standards and norms to improve performance outcomes. \n \n10.   Local Government Financing Issues. This component will assess the current state of \nintergovernment finances, help identify different models for resource distribution, and work with \nthe Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) to develop adequate mechanisms to ensure reliable, \ntransparent, formula-based transfers to local governments. The TA will also assist in developing \nand notifying powers for administrative and financial approval of development schemes to \ndistrict governments. \n \n11.  Consultation, Public-Private Partnership, and Civil Society Engagement. The TA \nwill help BPG develop a communications and consultation strategy to ensure involvement of \nstakeholders at each stage of the reform process, while also disseminating information on the \n ", "    Appendix 8  63\nreform program. Thus the implementation of reforms will be a transparent process, and the \nBRMP will be a means to broker debate on the Government\u2019s medium-term reform agenda. \n \n12.  Administrative Frameworks. This component will assist in strengthening the provincial \nPSC with a view to improving systems for appointments, postings, and transfers of public \nservants at all levels of government. In addition, the relative merits and demerits of introducing \nforms  of  contract-based  employment  in  the  public  sector  will  also  be  explored  and \nrecommendations made. Assistance may be provided to strengthen the Gender Reform Action \nPlan (GRAP).  \n \n13.   Water Resources Management. The TA will support the implementation of the water \nresources management policy currently under preparation for Balochistan. In particular, the TA \nwill support research and data analysis in key areas such as preparation of basin management \nplans, studies on cropping patterns in irrigated and nonirrigated areas, potential for recharge of \naquifers using techniques such as delayed action dams, etc. This component will also have a \nstrong capacity-building element and will focus on skills development of staff in key agencies \nresponsible for water management, and institutional restructuring to make existing institutions \nmore responsive to the needs of the sector. \n \n14.  Implementation Support, including Monitoring and Evaluation. The TA will assist \nBPG to establish a performance monitoring and evaluation system for the BRMP. The system \nwill be established to (i) ensure and demonstrate efficient and accountable use of public \nresources; (ii) support effective management of institutional arrangements due to the BRMP; \nand  (iii)  progressively  evaluate  the  impact  of  reforms  as  to  provide  tested  lessons  from \nexperience on which to modify the policies, regulations, and institutional arrangements of the \nreforms.  The  TA  will  help  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  refine  feedback \nmechanisms and monitoring systems, including required systems support.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA Project is estimated to be $6.56 million equivalent, comprising \n$1,305,000 in foreign exchange costs and $5,255,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The \nGovernment has requested a loan of Special Drawing Rights 2,037,000 ($3 million equivalent), \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the TA  Project. The loan will have a 32-\nyear term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \nloan and TA project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n16.  ADB will finance 45.73% of the total cost in support of components (i) \u2013 (vii) and (ix). The \nGovernment of the Netherlands indicated its intention to cofinance the TA on a parallel basis \nthrough a grant of $1.92 million or 29.27% of the total TA cost in support of component (viii). \nBPG will finance the remaining $1.64 million equivalent of the local currency costs or 25% of the \ntotal cost. The Government of the Netherlands will finance all foreign exchange costs and a \nportion of the local currency costs in conjunction with the water resources component, while \nADB will finance the remaining foreign exchange and local currency costs of this component. \nThe Government will contribute office space, counterpart staff and local transport finances.  \n \n   ", " 64 Appendix 8 \n \nTable A8: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \n \nForeign  Local  Total  \nItem \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  The Executing Agency \n \n17.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Finance Department of BPG. The TA will be \nimplemented with support by other line departments as appropriate, which will be implementing \nagencies (IAs). The IAs are  departments of planning and development; finance; irrigation; \nagriculture, food and cooperatives; local government and rural development; health; public \nhealth engineering; education; industries and commerce; mines and minerals; social welfare; \ninformation technology; local government; home and tribal; services and general administration \nas well as Board of Revenue. Finance Department, through the BRMP project management \nunit, will be responsible for coordination with the IAs and timely implementation of the TA. \n \n18.  The Finance Department will establish and maintain separate accounts for the loan in \naccordance with accounting procedures acceptable to ADB. The Government of Pakistan as the \nBorrower and BPG will cause the Finance Department to open an imprest account after loan \neffectiveness with the National Bank of Pakistan, Balochistan, to facilitate disbursement of loan \nproceeds. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in \naccordance with ADB's  Loan Disbursement Handbook. Total advances at any time to the \nimprest account should not exceed the lesser of the equivalent of 10% of the loan amount or 6 \nmonths estimated expenditures. The statement of expenditure procedures may be used to \nliquidate advances and to reimburse project expenditures for any individual payment transaction \nnot exceeding $20,000. The accounts, together with record of expenditures under the loan, will \nbe audited annually by independent auditors in accordance with auditing standards acceptable \nto ADB. The audit report will include a separate opinion on the use of imprest account and \nstatement of expenditure procedures and compliance with financial covenants under the loan \nagreement. Certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements and the report of \nthe auditors will be submitted to ADB in English within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n \n2.   Schedule, Reports, and Reviews \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over about 3 years following the effective date of the loan. \nClosing date for the loan is expected for 30 June 2008.  \n \n20.  Each component of the TA will be implemented in three phases. During the inception \nphase, the lead consultants of the various components will revalidate the policy objectives and \nassess priorities and key issues, on the governance, regulatory, and operational level. The \nconsultants  will  also  start  working  with  departments  to  implement  the  capacity-building \ninitiatives. At the end of this phase, resource inputs may be adjusted as appropriate within the \noverall budgetary framework and TA scope, to better align the terms of reference, activities, and \ntime-bound outputs with client expectations and needs. The next phase will concentrate on \nimplementation, whether this relates to preparation of studies and reports or capacity building \nand institution of monitoring and evaluation systems. The last phase of implementation will \ninvolve  the  finalization  of  reports,  obtaining  BPG  concurrence  on  recommendations,  and \nensuring that the requisite systems for effective implementation of reform programs has been \nput into place.  \n \n21.  The consultants will prepare an inception report on their respective components within 4 \nweeks of the commencement of their services, which will fine-tune and detail the work program \nand establish time-bound outputs. In addition to any full report required at the end of each \n   ", " 66 Appendix 8 \nindividual component, the consultants and the IAs will submit quarterly progress reports. The \nfinal report, including complete documentation of all outputs, will be submitted within 3 months \nof the end of the assignment, after the comments of ADB and the Government  have been \nincorporated. \n \n22.  In addition to regular and ongoing interaction among the IAs, ADB, and its consultants, \ntwo comprehensive reviews, after 12 and 24 months will be undertaken jointly by ADB, the IAs, \nFinance Department, and consultants to review all aspects of implementation. \n \n3.   Procurement \n \n23.  The  computer  hardware  and  software  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of $500,000 or less (other than minor items) will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational  shopping,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  $50,000  or  less  may  be  procured \nfollowing direct purchase procedures. \n \n4.   Consulting Services \n \n24.  The  TA  will  require  about  345  person-months  of  consulting  services,  including  15 \nperson-months  of  international  and  330  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services. \nSeparate subcontracting of services of individual consultants or firms may be required for \nselected  aspects.  All  consultants  (including  those  for  the  Water  Resources  Management \ncomponent financed by the Government of the Netherlands) will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Where  firms  are  to  be  engaged,  the  quality-based \nselection method will be utilized for consultant selection, because of the emphasis on capacity \nbuilding and on hiring experienced consultants to work under difficult circumstances in less \ndeveloped parts of Balochistan. Nine separate contract packages are expected to be prepared \nfor the various components. For the selection of consulting firms, simplified technical proposals \nwill be used. The TA will emphasize the mobilization of expertise available within Pakistan to \nensure sustainable capacity building of public resource management. Capacity building to be \nsupported under the TA will focus on training and skills development services that can be \ndelivered by Pakistani private and/or public sector institutions and, in particular, activities that \ncan be integrated within the normal functioning of the concerned client agencies. \n \n25.  In view of the overall scope of the TA on supporting public resource management \nreforms in Balochistan the following sector expertise will be required: \n \n(i)  public expenditure/subsidies: public finance specialist, capacity development \nspecialist; \n(ii)  revenue enhancement: public finance specialist, tax and tax policy specialist; \n(iii)  financial management: financial management specialist, capacity development \nspecialist; \n(iv)  service delivery issues: health specialist, poverty specialist, gender specialist; \n(v)  local government financing issues: specialist on intergovernmental transfers; \n(vi)  consultation,  public-private  partnerships,  and  civil  society  engagement: \nadvocacy, nongoverernment organization, and private sector specialists; \n(vii)  administrative  frameworks:  public  sector  specialist,  legal  expert,  human \nresource management specialist, gender specialist; \n ", "    Appendix 8  67\n(viii)  water resources management: water resources management specialist, civil \nsociety specialist, spate irrigation specialist; irrigated farming specialist, rural \nwater supply specialist, water and ecosystem specialist, economist, capacity \ndevelopment specialist; and \n(ix)  implementation  support:  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist,  change \nmanagement specialist. \n \n \n   ", " 68 Appendix 9 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n \nA.   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n1.   Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  The Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) paper is the main official statement on poverty in \nPakistan, incorporating both an analysis of poverty and an action plan for poverty reduction. \nPoverty is understood to include income and consumption deprivation, as well as low levels of \nhuman development. The PRS analysis concludes that poverty reduction must be based on four \npillars: (i) achieving higher economic growth through sound macroeconomic management, fiscal \nand  financial  reforms,  expanding  infrastructure,  and  rural  development;  (ii)  improving \ngovernance and devolution; (iii) investing in human capital; and (iv) targeting the poor and \nvulnerable, including attention to a regional perspective. The national PRS, moreover, identifies \nBalochistan as a province of high poverty, and the lowest human development indicators. Eight \nof the 10 most deprived districts in Pakistan are in Balochistan. \n \n2.  The Balochistan provincial government (BPG) produced its own PRS focused on the \nspecific conditions and constraints of the province, and based on an extensive review of poverty \ndata and a participatory poverty analysis. In addition to the issues already identified in the \nnational PRS, the provincial PRS stresses two major areas of specific concern: (i) managing \nscarce water resources, and (ii) addressing vulnerability to shock. It is committed to framing \npoverty reduction policies with reference to reliable and up-to-date district data on poverty and \nsocial development in the province (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey). \n \n2.   Poverty Analysis: Poverty and Public Resource Management in \nBalochistan \n \n3.  Balochistan faces unique challenges of poverty, and also unique opportunities for growth \nand  poverty  reduction.  The  main  structural  features  of  poverty  in  Balochistan  can  be \nsummarized as sparse population, remoteness, and poor physical infrastructure; intraprovincial \ngeographical  and  social  diversity;  stress  on  environmental  resources;  porous  international \nborders; weak institutional presence of government; strong informal institutions of governance; \nand  highly  unequal  gender  relations.  The  low  initial  state  implies  the  need  for  sustained \ninvestment for bringing the population to a level on par with the rest of Pakistan. At the same \ntime, it signifies, under favorable conditions, the possibility of high rates of growth. \n  \n4.  Poverty reduction in Balochistan will depend critically on the institutional strength and \nfinancial sustainability of the machinery of provincial government. Much of the badly needed \ninvestment and reform is in subjects that are either directly within the domain of BPG or are \nlocal  government  issues  in  which  BPG  retains  a  role  for  coordination  and  standards. \nInvestments in both physical as well as social infrastructure will need to be initially driven by \ngovernment, because these are typically in public goods and on long-term gestation projects. \nMoreover, for the development of private sector investment opportunities BPG\u2014both in terms of \nits physical infrastructure, but also in terms of its institutional reach across the province\u2014will \nhave to expand and become more efficient. Besides poor physical and social infrastructure, a \nkey constraint to private sector growth in Balochistan is conflict, insecurity, and uncertain rule of \nthe law. The high degree of intraprovincial geographical and social diversity highlights the need \nnot only for strong local government but also for coordination across subregions on the part of a \nstrong provincial government. \n ", "    Appendix 9  69\n \n5.  The  low  level  and  uneven  geographic  spread  of  physical  and  social  infrastructure \nremains at the heart of the various dimensions of poverty in Balochistan. BPG needs to take a \nlead not only in redressing the infrastructure deficit, but also in introducing pro-poor targeting in \nthe design and implementation of development policies and programs. Current systems of \nresource allocation within the province pay little explicit attention to poverty-related criteria. \n \n6.  The current condition of provincial finances leaves little scope for BPG to play its \nrequisite  role  in  poverty  reduction.  BPG  relies  heavily  on  nonrevenue  financing, and has \nacquired an unsustainable debt burden. Provincial revenue generation remains marginal. The \ntwo main provincial subsidies\u2014wheat and electricity for tubewells\u2014are highly inefficient. The \nformer entails a high degree of leakage to the non-poor. The latter mostly benefits the rich, and \nleads to an unsustainable exploitation of scarce water resources. The reach and quality of \nprovincial public services remains inadequate. \n \n7.  The BRMP is aimed (particularly through policy reform areas (PRAs) 1 to  4) at the \nreform of public finances and financial management. The reforms envisaged under the BRMP \nare essential for the sustainability of provincial finances, which, in turn, is a precondition for the \neffectiveness of the machinery of provincial government. The BRMP, moreover, is focused on \nimproving the quality, capacity, and governance of BPG as service provider, financial manager, \nand coordinator. A critical feature of the BRMP is to explicitly introduce poverty-related criteria in \nthe allocation of development expenditures through the $20 million equivalent Special Funds \nresources loan within the program loan facility. Reform of the PSDP will also include the explicit \nincorporation of poverty-related criteria in the choice of project location. These inputs provide \ncritical support to the aims of the provincial PRS, and are expected to lead to more widespread \nuse of poverty-related criteria in resource allocation, e.g. in the Provincial Finance Commission \nawards. Other features of the BRMP include the reform of public social services (PRA 5\u20136), \nnotably in health. These human development interventions are critical investments for medium \nto long-term change in social structures including gender inequality and social hierarchy. The \nBRMP also directly addresses two specific concerns of the PRS: water resources management \n(PRA 7), and risk and vulnerability (e.g., pro-poor reform of food subsidy in PRA 1). \n \n3.   Participation Process \n \na.   Stakeholder Analysis \n \n8.  Stakeholders broadly include all citizens of Pakistan and, in particular, citizens directly \nconnected with Balochistan. The BRMP will affect citizens directly in their capacity as taxpayers \n(through  changes  in  resource  constraints,  taxation,  and  financial  reforms),  and  users  of \ngovernment and public services (through changes in resource constraints, organizational and \ntechnical capacity of government agencies, user charges, and overall quality of governance). \nThe BRMP will also affect citizens indirectly through its impact on growth and poverty reduction. \n \n9.  The stakeholders are represented, in principle, by the federal Government, by BPG, and \nby local government through constitutional provisions and elected representatives, as well as by \nautonomous  civil  society  organizations.  In  practice,  however,  the  interests  of  many \nstakeholders, particularly the poorest, may not be effectively represented due to social exclusion \nand political marginalization.1 The interests and concerns of the poorest, therefore, require \n                                                 \n1  It cannot be presumed that existing mechanisms for political representation adequately reflect the interests of the \npoor, since lack of political voice and social status are themselves determinants of poverty. \n   ", " 70 Appendix 9 \n \nspecific  attention.  Besides  individual  citizens,  significant  stakeholders  include  government \nofficials at various levels (for whom many of the policy changes have specific implications in \nterms of their functioning, career paths, and service contracts), the private sector (both domestic \nand foreign); and civil society organizations. \n  \nb.   Participation Strategy \n \n10.  The national and provincial PRSs provide the main channel through which the BRMP \nincorporates  stakeholders\u2019  interests  and  concerns.  The  PRSs  are  based  on  extensive \nconsultation  in  government  and  civil  society  at  various  levels.  The  participatory  poverty \nassessment provides critical and often excluded perspectives of the poor and socially excluded \ngroups,  which  are  reflected  in  the  provincial  PRS.  Besides  this  broad  representation  of \nstakeholder  interests,  consultations  among  officials  and  elected  representatives  at  various \nlevels ensured the participation of stakeholders within government and in the political process. \nIn particular, in addition to BRMP-wide consultations with key stakeholders, a consultation \nprocess  is  under  way  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  around  the  water  resource \nmanagement component of the BRMP, the outcomes of which will be fed into a communications \nstrategy. \n \n11.  Finally, BRMP components and actions are premised upon policy studies (such as: \nagricultural income tax, food security reform, tubewell electricity price reform, private sector \ndevelopment,  public  private  partnerships,  water  management,  public  service  pricing  and \ndelivery). These studies that are an integral part of the BRMP will be based upon extensive \nstakeholder  consultation  in  specific  areas  of  reform  and  action,  from  the  overall  BRMP \nperspective of impacting positively on the living standards of the poor. \n \n4.   Social Issues \n \n12.  Poverty reduction in Balochistan involves four key social issues: (i) patriarchal norms \nand severe female disadvantage; (ii) intraprovincial sociocultural diversity across communities; \n(iii) caste, clan, and tribe-based social hierarchy and exclusion within communities; and (iv) \nprevalence of conflict and insecurity of various types. Expansion of the reach and quality of \npublic goods and services such as schooling, health, drinking water and sanitation, roads, food \nsecurity, and law and order are seen as the appropriate policy interventions for overcoming \nthese social-structural constraints. The BRMP is a prerequisite for the financial sustainability \nand effectiveness of BPG, which is a key agency for expanding the reach and quality of public \ngoods and services.  \n \na.   Gender \n \n13.  Balochistan is characterized by particularly strong patriarchal norms and severe female \ndisadvantage. The participatory poverty assessment highlights the wide prevalence of female \neconomic and social exploitation, violence against women, and female exclusion from public \nspaces. The BRMP components relating to the expansion in the reach and quality of social \nservices such as schooling, health, drinking water, and sanitation have a in-built pro-female \nbias. Improved service delivery within easy reach will benefit females in particular, since males \nalready have a wider range of choices (in the public as well as private sectors) due to their \nbetter mobility. The BRMP components will have a long-run impact on social norms concerning \nfemale access to public spaces and employment. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 9  71\nb.   Access \n \n14.  The four social-structural constraints identified in para. 12 are also the main dimensions \nof social exclusion in Balochistan that restrict access to markets, economic opportunities, social \nservices, and political participation, as well as access to entitlements (safety, security, assets, \nresources).  \n \n15.  First, a key outcome of the BRMP will be sustainable provincial finances. Given that the \nburden of financial crisis has fallen disproportionately on the poor and the socially excluded, \nmore robust finances will directly benefit this group. Moreover, program design has features for \nimproving allocative efficiency and transparency, therefore allowing greater public oversight into \nthe benefits of the fiscal space created by the BRMP. \n \n16.  Second, BRMP components (particularly PRAs 5 and 6) are aimed at improving the \nquality of social services that are public goods by design, and are disproportionately used by \nmarginalized groups to begin with. \n \n17.  Third, some BRMP components are specifically directed at improving poor people\u2019s \naccess to public transfers\u2014most notably the proposal for the redesign of a pro-poor food \nsecurity strategy in place of the untargeted wheat subsidy. The reform of the tubewell subsidy \nalso ensures that the non-poor do not absorb the benefits of greater fiscal space created by the \nBRMP. \n \n18.  Some BRMP component actions (such as user charges for tertiary services, strictly \nmerit-based employment contracts) have positive efficiency effects, but might have negative \nimplications  for  access  to  some  of  the  socially  excluded.  Historically  disadvantaged \ncommunities have gained access to higher education and formal employment through politically \nmotivated interventions. Since labor markets tend to be socially segmented, moving to user-\ncharges and strictly merit-based contracting might exclude historically marginalized groups. \n \nc.   Equity \n \n19.  BRMP taxation reforms will make the tax structure less regressive and thus contribute to \ngreater equity. Similarly measures aimed at recovering user charges for tertiary services are \nlikely to be equity-inducing in economic terms (given that currently the poor subsidize the \nrelatively better-off) though their effects on social equity might be less clear (para. 18). The \nreform  of  the  tubewell  electricity  subsidy  will  improve  equity,  since  this  subsidy \ndisproportionately benefits the non-poor. \n \n20.  The removal of the untargeted wheat subsidy will lead to an increase in food prices, and \ntherefore disproportionately affect the poor. In  the absence of countervailing measures, this \naction  will  increase  household  consumption/income  inequality.  As  part  of  a  broader  food \nsecurity reform, however, the removal of the wheat subsidy can reduce inequality. The BRMP \nwill introduce a poverty-targeted atta subsidy, which may be included in a revised pro-poor food \nsecurity policy. \n \n21.  The  BRMP  makes  available  a  $20  million  Special  Funds  resources  loan  with  the \nprogram  loan  facility  to  be  used  to  support  development  budget  expenditures  by  local \ngovernments.  The  process  of  resource  allocation  between  districts  will  explicitly  include \nevidence-based,  poverty-related  criteria,  and  as  such,  will  provide  a  prototype  for  future \n   ", " 72 Appendix 9 \n \nallocation processes such as the upcoming PFC. The adoption of evidence-based poverty-\nrelated criteria will be a major advance toward pro-poor budgeting in Balochistan. \n \nd.   Sustainability \n \n22.  The  BRMP  is  primarily  concerned  with  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  provincial \ngovernment. Actions in PRA 1\u20134 in particular are aimed at creating fiscal space and sustainable \nfinancial management. PRA 7 of the BRMP (water resources management) is largely concerned \nwith the sustainability of scarce water resources in Balochistan. The reform of the tubewell \nelectricity subsidy (PRA 1) will assist in achieving sustainable water management by reducing \nthe incentives for water-mining. Social sector reforms in PRA 5 and 6 are directed at long-term \nsustainable improvements in service delivery through actions such as changes in governance \nstructures and merit-based contracting. \n \ne.   Laborers, and Urban and Rural Poor \n \n23.  Labor Markets. Significant direct short-term effects on the level of employment are \nunlikely. Indirect medium-term effects include greater public sector employment as a result of \nfiscal space, and some increase in private sector employment due to greater investment. \nChanges  in  public  sector  employment  practices  (including  greater  stress  on  merit-based \nappointments) will improve the efficiency of labor markets and create stronger medium to long \nrun incentives for investment in human capital. These measures may exacerbate labor market \nsegmentation along the lines of ethnicity and sociocultural background (para. 18). \n \n24.  Urban Poor. Real wages of laborers in urban areas may decline in the short-term with \nthe withdrawal of the wheat subsidy, but overall real household consumption may rise if this \ntakes place as part of a reform of food security. \n \n25.  Rural  Poor.  The  proportion  of  the  rural  population  (76%)  is  high  in  Balochistan \ncompared with Pakistan as a whole (67%). The net effect of the tax and subsidy reforms on the \nrural  poor  is  likely  to  be  positive.  The  rural  poor  will  also  be  the  main  beneficiaries  of \nimprovements in social services (PRA 5 and 6), and the reform of water resources management \n(PRA 7). \n \nTable A9: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \nA.

Balochistan is the most deprived province according to a wide range of \nindicators. \n \nB. Poverty Analysis       \n \nPoverty  reduction  in  Balochistan  depends  on  sustainable  provincial  finances  and  poverty-focused  resource \nallocations. The province has unique challenges in terms of: extremely low initial levels of development; weak and \nuneven reach and quality of the machinery of provincial government; extreme patriarchy and gender inequality; \ngeographical  and  sociocultural  diversity;  fragility  of  environmental  resources,  particularly  in  terms  of  water \navailability, and vulnerability to drought; and prevalence of conflict and insecurity. The financial sustainability of BPG \n ", "    Appendix 9  73\n(Balochistan Resource Management Program [BRMP]  policy reform areas [PRAs] 1\u20134) is a prerequisite for \nmeeting these challenges. The BRMP introduces (through the Special Funds resources facility) poverty-related \ncriteria explicitly into the resource allocation process in Balochistan. BRMP PRAs 1\u20136 further ensure\u2014through \ngovernance reforms and improvements in the quality of social services\u2014that fiscal resources are utilized for poverty \nreduction in line with Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program (BPRSP) priorities.

The Context \n \n1.  The social indicators in Balochistan clearly highlight gender inequality: female literacy \nrate is 16% compared with 32% nationally; maternal mortality rate is 400 as against 340 in \nPakistan; enrollment rate for girls is 16% as against 49% for boys in the province; there are 115 \nmen to 100 women in Balochistan. The percentage of labor force participation of women is \nreported as 2.07 as against 65.88 for men.1 Women\u2019s access to social services and other \nsupportive infrastructure is limited due to restrictions on their mobility. Cases of violence against \nwomen are reported frequently. Tribal culture of Balochistan where decision-making is a male \nprerogative  and  patriarchy  a  norm,  marginalizes  women.  The  sociocultural  traditions  link \nwomen\u2019s sexuality to the concepts of honor, further limiting space outside the home for women. \nThis results in fewer opportunities for education, low employment, low income, few female titles \nto property, and little participation in community and society. Although exact figures are not \navailable, the  Gender Reform Action Plan (GRAP) analytical report mentions that a large \nmajority of people living in poverty in Balochistan, are women. The patriarchal bias in state \ninstitutions translates into underinvestment in women\u2019s needs. \n \n2.  The Balochistan provincial government (BPG) has taken several initiatives in partnership \nwith bilateral and multilateral development agencies as well as civil society organizations to \nimprove the position of women. And while the situation seems to be on the road to recovery, a \nshared vision is lacking and the strategic leadership vacuum is obvious. BPG concurs with \nseveral commitments of the federal Government to reduce gender imbalance and remove \nbarriers in achieving full potential for women, however, capacity to initiate and implement \ninterventions is severely limited. \n \n3.  Women\u2019s political participation has improved since devolution;  this may lead to other \nvenues of success for women in Balochistan. \n \nB.  Key Gender Issues in Public Sector \n \n4.  Implementation of National Commitments on Gender. BPG, in principle, is dedicated \nto  effectively  implementing  the  federal  Government\u2019s  international  as  well  as  national \ncommitments on gender equality such as Charter on Elimination of Discrimination against \nWomen, the National Plan of Action (1998) and the National Policy on Development and \nEmpowerment  of  Women  (2002).  However,  policy  and  fiscal  support  to  implement  these \ncommitments is limited and administrative capacity deficient. \n \n5.  Public Expenditure on Promoting Gender Equality. The real current expenditure of \nBalochistan on social services (education, health, population) has increased from PRs292.5 \nmillion in FY1990/91 to PRs498.5 million in FY2001. However, the allocation to the Women\u2019s \nDevelopment Department (WDD) has remained a small fraction of the total budget. Advocacy \non gender issues and mainstreaming gender into all development planning and implementation \nis the responsibility of WDD. A gender-sensitive budgetary framework is needed as well as \nenhancement  of  the  human,  professional,  and  technical  capacity  of  WDD  to  enable  it  to \neffectively deliver its mandate.  \n                                                 \n1  Balochistan Provincial Government. 2004. Draft Poverty Reduction Strategy (April). Quetta. \n ", "Appendix 10  75\n \n6.  Gender Policy Formulation and Matching Institutional Arrangements. The current \nframework for policy formulation and execution in BPG exhibits a lack of understanding of the \nimportance of weaving gender concerns into development programs; this lack of understanding \ntranslates into gender insensitive implementation even where the rhetoric is adhered to. WDD \ndoes  have  the  responsibility  of  gender  mainstreaming  but  with  no  matching  authority  or \nresources, whether human or financial\u2014a deputy director with a skeleton staff is managing this \nmandate  at  the  moment.  The  line  departments  lack  capacity  (staff,  training  on  gender \nmainstreaming)  for  inclusion  of  gender  concerns  into  their  development  initiatives.  Proper \ninstitutional arrangements are needed both at the provincial and district levels for effective \ngender mainstreaming. \n \n7.  Representation and Empowerment. The total number of women in local governments \nall over Pakistan is  36,105. In Balochistan, there are  2,374 women representatives in union \ncouncils with 734 seats being vacant;  at the subdistrict (tehsil) level, there are 129 women \nrepresentatives, with 22 seats being vacant; at the district council level, there are 152 women \nrepresentatives, with 21 vacant seats. There are 5 women Members of National Assembly from \nBalochistan and 12 women members of the Provincial Assembly. However, most of these \npolitical  leaders  need  capacity  building  in  gender  sensitivity,  planning,  agenda  setting, \ncollaboration techniques, negotiation skills, alliance building, and gender-sensitive budgeting. \nBPG and other civil society organizations have initiated programs to provide the relevant \nsupport and training. Nevertheless, it will take time before gender concerns are entrenched in \nwomen politicians\u2019 agenda. \n \n8.  Gender  Disparities  in  Public  Sector  Employment.  Lack  of  gender  proactive \nrecruitment procedures and lack of facilities for women in public sector employment result in \ngender disparity in public sector employment. WDD has only one female officer. The Services \nand General Administration Department has one female section officer, one superintendent, \nthree senior scale stenographers, and two junior clerks out of a total of 419 functionaries.2 The \ncommitments about the women\u2019s quotas in public sector employment and the commitments \nunder the National Plan of Action have not been institutionalized. \n \nC.    Gender Reforms Required \n \n9.  Comprehensive gender reforms at all levels of the public sphere, from development \nplanning  and  budgeting  to  execution  and  monitoring;  institutional  systems  and  procedures \ncomplemented by supportive efforts such as gender training and personnel, at the provincial as \nwell as district level, are essential for engendering governance structures. Providing a central \nplatform for coordination and collaboration not only among government departments but also \nwith civil society organizations is critical. \n \nD.  Ongoing Gender Reform Initiatives \n \n10.  BPG is committed to reforming its policies, systems, procedures, and administrative \nstructures to promote gender equality in line with Government\u2019s national and international \ncommitments. BPG\u2019s gender reform agenda is articulated in the GRAP, which was approved by \nthe Balochistan Cabinet on 18 July 2004. The goal of the GRAP is to bring about changes in the \nstructure and process of government to promote equity among men and women, and deliver on \n                                                 \n2  National Commission of the Status of Women. 2002. Draft Report on An Inquiry into the Status of Women \nEmployment in Public Sector Organizations. Islamabad.  \n   ", "76   Appendix 10 \n \nthe rights and entitlements of women. Gender mainstreaming is the key strategy to realize this \ngoal.  \n  \n11.  The GRAP is an outcome of 14 months\u2019 consultation with key government departments, \nparliamentarians,  women  rights  activists,  nongovernment  organizations  and  gender  and \ndevelopment experts. In addition, analytical background studies were conducted as part of the \nGender Review of Political and Administrative Systems in Balochistan.  \n \n12.  The GRAP seeks to address some of the gender gaps through (i) political reforms, (ii) \nadministrative/institutional reforms, (iii) reforms in public sector employment, and (iv) policy and \nfiscal reforms. To these are added comprehensive capacity-building interventions and support \nactions. Estimated costs are given for each designed action with possible sources of funding \npointed out and placed in a time frame. The responsibilities have also been indicated for the \nimplementation of each action. Similarly, the emerging programs and projects are also stated.  \n \n13.  The GRAP will be implemented over 4 years. The cost of these reforms will be financed \nthrough various bilateral, multilateral, and government sources mainly by BPG and federal \nMinistry  of  Finance  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assisted  Decentralization \nSupport Program. The total cost of the GRAP will be close to $9 million. Of this approximately \n$4 million is capital and nonrecurrent costs, while around $5 million is the total recurrent cost \nover 4 years. \n \n14.  The success of any reform, particularly gender and governance reform, is subject to \nmany constraints, limitations, prerequisites, and sociopolitical variables. Continued policy and \nfinancial commitment by BPG will be required for successful implementation of the GRAP. \n  \n15.  ADB\u2019s  principal  commitments  to  gender  and  governance  reforms  in  Pakistan  are \narticulated through major governance reform programs.3 ADB is committed to promoting gender \nreforms across the sector, at the federal, provincial, and local levels, and in the political, judicial, \nadministrative, and fiscal spheres of the government. Approval and successful implementation \nof  the  Balochistan  GRAP  is  directly  cross-linked  with  ADB-assisted  policy  loans  like  the \nDecentralization Support Program. \n \nE.  Integration of Gender Reforms in the BRMP \n \n16.  The BRMP will facilitate successful implementation of the GRAP by relevant government \nagencies. Continued policy and financial commitment will be required for successful GRAP \nimplementation.  To  ensure  continued  policy  and  financial  support  required  for  successful \nimplementation of the Balochistan GRAP, the following actions are suggested under the BRMP: \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.
