The  reform \npriorities  include  efforts  to  improve  the  investment  climate,  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement,  and  governance,  and  enhance  poverty  reduction  and  access  to  public  service \ndelivery. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter \nis in Appendix 3. Appendix 4 presents the policy matrix for the program.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  proposed  program  is  the  sixth  and  last  of  a  series  of  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  development  policy  support  programs  (DPSPs)  for  Indonesia,  prepared  jointly  with  the \nWorld Bank and the Government of Japan. Since its initiation, the DPSP series was designed to \nsupport the Government of Indonesia\u2019s medium-term reform agenda in core areas underpinned \nby  its  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN).  The  focus  of  the  DPSP  series  has \nevolved since 2003, reflecting changes in the country\u2019s needs and priorities. In first four years, \nthe  emphasis  was  on  ensuring  medium-term  macroeconomic  stability  and  building  the  basic \nlegal  and  regulatory  framework  for  investment  as  well  as  public  financial  management  and \ngovernance.  As  macroeconomic  resilience  improved,  the  government  and  development \npartners agreed to replace the macroeconomic pillar with support for reforms in public service \ndelivery. Since 2007, the DPSP series has focused on three core policy areas: the investment \nclimate, public financial management and governance, and poverty reduction and public service \ndelivery.  In  2009,  some  of  the  reforms  envisaged  during  the  last  5-year  plan  period  remained \nunfinished.  At  the  request  of  the  government,  the  proposed  DPSP-6  was  included  for  2010  in \nADB\u2019s  Indonesia  country  operations  business  plan,  2010\u20132012. 1 The  DPSP  series  has \ncomplemented  implementation  of  other  ADB  programs,  including  the  Public  Expenditure \nSupport  Facility,  Countercyclical  Support  Facility,  and,  Local  Government  Finance  and \nGovernance Reform.2 \n \n4. \nThe  program  completion  reports  for  the  first  three  programs  under  the  DPSP  series \nsuggested that policy actions supported by the series have contributed significantly to improved \neconomic management, albeit from a low base.3 Among other achievements, the program has \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2010\u20132012, Manila. The government agreed to ADB\u2019s \nexit  from  the  series  starting  in  2011. The World  Bank  and  the  Government  of  Japan  will  extend  its  Development \nPolicy Loan (DPL) support with a new cluster for 2010\u20132012. ADB will continue to provide support through TAs on \nprocurement  and  audit  in  coordination  with  other  development  partners  and  participate  in  enhancing  poverty \nreduction  and  access  to  public  service  delivery  through  the  PNPM  Mandiri  with  an  infrastructure  focus.  ADB  will \nalso  continue  to  support  policy  reforms  in  decentralization,  climate  change,  capital  markets  development,  and \ninfrastructure. \n\nIndonesia \n\n2   ADB.  2009.

A joint program completion report will be prepared for DPSP-4 to DPSP-6. \n\nfor \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nhelped the government devise a public debt management strategy, reorient budget savings from \nreduction  in  fuel  subsidies  toward  priority  social  sectors  and  targeted  poverty  reduction \nprograms, and expand the tax base through tax administration reforms. Under the fourth DPSP \nonward,  reforms  to  improve  the  investment  climate  have  led  to  the  passage  of  an  Investment \nLaw,  a  significant  reduction  in  business  start-up  time,  a  shorter  time  for  value-added  tax \nrefunds,  and  enhanced  access  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  to  finance.  Reforms  in \npublic  financial  management  and  governance  have  improved  budget  formulation,  execution, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  DPSP  series  has  supported  efforts  to  increase  budget \nallocation  for  poverty  programs,  improve  pro-poor  planning  and  budgeting,  and  enhance \ncommunity-driven development under the government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri. \n   \n5. \nWhile  significant  progress  has  been  achieved,  the  government  is  committed  to \nimplementing  further  reforms  in  DPSP  core  reform  areas.  Recent  economic  growth  remains \nbelow the level achieved before the Asian financial crisis. To achieve higher and more inclusive \ngrowth,  a  recent  ADB  study  suggests  the  need  to  accelerate  infrastructure  development, \nimprove governance and institutions, and enhance access to better education.4 Despite recent \nimprovement  in  economic  competitiveness  indicators, 5   efforts  are  needed  to  improve  trade \nlogistics  and  simplify  business  procedures.  Continued  efforts  are  needed  to  implement  a \nmodern  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system.  While  significant  progress  has  been \nachieved,  poverty  rates  remain  high.  Poverty  incidence  declined  to  13.3%  in  2010,  but  rates \nvary  widely  among  regions  and  about  40%  of  the  population  is  estimated  to  be  near  poor \n(clustered just above the national poverty line), making them highly vulnerable to fall back into \npoverty.  The  government\u2019s  new  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014  adopted  a  three-pillar  development \nstrategy: pro-growth, pro-jobs, and pro-poor. The government recognizes the need to increase \nprivate  investment  to  support  its  pro-jobs  growth  strategy.  It  also  recognizes  that  continued \nimprovement  in  the  investment  climate,  governance,  public  service  delivery,  and  poverty \nreduction are crucial to achieving its pro-poor objective. Therefore, the three core policy areas \nsupported under the DPSP-6 are among the 11 priorities in the RPJMN, 2010\u20132014.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe  impact  of  the  DPSP-6  will  be  to  achieve  higher  pro-poor  economic  growth  that  is \nsustained over the medium term. The outcome will be improved overall economic management \nanchored on good governance, which will help generate more and better jobs, and contribute to \nsustainable poverty reduction.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n7. \nThe  DPSP-6  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  three  core  reform  areas:  (i) improve \nthe  investment  climate,  (ii)  strengthen  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and \n(iii) enhance poverty reduction and access to public service delivery. All 13 policy actions for the \nDPSP-6 identified during preparation of the DPSP-5 have been completed to a satisfactory level \nof  reform.  Five  new  policy  actions  have  been  added  to  reflect  the  priorities  of  the  new \ngovernment, which took office in October 2009, have been satisfactorily completed.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2010.  Indonesia:  Critical  Development  Constraints.  Manila.  ADB  supports  the  government\u2019s  effort  to \naccelerate infrastructure development through the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program; ADB. 2009. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia for the Second Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program., Manila.  \n\n5  According to the World Economic Forum, Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness ranking improved 10 places to 44 in 2010. \n\n\f1. \n\nImprove Investment Climate  \n\nlists\u2014hence  more \n\nthan  previous  negative \n\n \n8. \nImproving  the  investment  climate  continues  to  be  a  key  priority  in  the  government\u2019s \nreform  agenda.  As  outlined  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014,  the  country  will  need  significant \ninvestment  to  elevate  its  growth  to  6%\u20137%  in  the  medium  term.  The  government  at  most  can \nprovide  about  20%  of  the  overall  required  investment  (about  $1.3  trillion).  Hence,  facilitating \ndomestic  and  foreign  private  investment  is  urgently  needed.  The  prospects  for  investing  in \nIndonesia are quite promising, given its significant population and natural resources. Therefore, \nthe  RPJMN  places  a  high  priority  on  harmonizing  policies  and  regulations,  streamlining \nprocedures,  promoting  customs  and  trade  facilitation,  and  improving  infrastructure  and \nstrengthening  the  financial  sector  to  support  a  sound  investment  climate.  Given  the  need  to \nenlarge  the  fiscal  space  to  support  infrastructure  and  other  poverty  reduction  programs, \nimproving the performance of the tax system is a medium-term objective of the reform agenda.  \n \n9. \nSupported by the DPSP-6, the government implemented a number of reform initiatives \nto address some of those constraints by issuing a revised investment negative list, simplifying \ninvestment  licensing  procedures,  establishing  a  national  single  window,  developing  a  national \nlogistics blueprint, and strengthening tax administration organization and business processes. \n \nInvestment  negative  list.  While  the  July  2007  investment  negative  list  was  more \n10. \ndetailed  and  comprehensive \ntransparent\u2014it \nintroduced new restrictions in key sectors such as telecommunications, health, shipping, ports, \nlogistics,  pharmaceuticals,  and  insurance.  It  also  failed  to  clarify  issues  relating  to  how \nincumbent  investors  in  these  sectors  would  be  treated  (grandfather  clause).  In  response  to \nconcerns  raised  by  industry,  Presidential  Regulation  No.  36/2010  to  revise  the  investment \nnegative list was issued on 25 May 2010. The regulation addresses investor concerns regarding \nthe  grandfather  clause,  the  treatment  of  publicly  listed  companies,  mergers  and  acquisitions, \nand  the  hierarchy  of  regulations  related  to  investment  in  Indonesia.  It  also  opens  up  a  few \nadditional  sectors  to  all  foreign  investors  and  incorporates  Indonesia\u2019s  commitments  to  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), providing more liberal treatment for ASEAN \ncompanies. (Completed.) \n \n11. \nOnline  investment  licensing  system.  The  Investment  Law,  2007,  stipulates  that  a \npresidential  regulation  on  one-door  integrated  investment  service  (PTSP)  shall  be  issued.  A \npresidential regulation was issued on 23 June 2009 to allow ministries and central government \nagencies to delegate their authority to issue business licenses to the Investment Board (BKPM) \nand  authorizes  BKPM  to  establish  a  one-stop  integrated  services  for  investment  licensing. \nBKPM issued Regulation No. 11/2009 guiding implementation of PTSP and developed an online \ninvestment licensing application system that is now accessible on the BKPM website. A pilot of \nthe  system  was  launched  in  January  2010  in  Batam,  and  it  has  been  implemented  in  Jakarta \nand seven cities. The government is planning to implement the system in the capital city of each \nprovince and numerous districts by December 2010. (Completed.) \n \n12. \nNational single window. The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) issued \nDecision  No.  5/2010  to  form  a  national  team  for  implementation  of  the  national  single  window \n(NSW) and to appoint the Directorate General Customs as an interim operator of the NSW until \n2012. A  model was launched in January 2010 in five major ports throughout Indonesia, which is \na major step toward reducing the time and cost for importing and exporting by allowing single \nsubmission, single processing, and single approval of import or export documents.6 In 2009, up \n\n                                                 \n6   In  implementing  NSW,  the  government  has  received  assistance  from  ASEAN,  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic \n\nCooperation, and other development partners. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nto  36  government  agencies  were  involved  in  granting  permits  or  licenses  for  export  or  import \nand  a  large  number  of  documents  were  required  (48  for  export  and  106  for  import).  With  the \nNSW,  these  procedures  are  expected  to  be  simplified  significantly.  (New  policy  action: \ncompleted.)  \n \n13. \nNational  logistics  blueprint.  The  government  has  developed  a  National  Logistics \nBlueprint  (NLB)  and  Action  with  three  main  objectives:  (i)  ensure  the  availability  of  strategic \ncommodities  at  affordable  prices,  (ii)  reduce  logistics  costs  to  facilitate  the  competitiveness  of \nexport products, and (iii) prepare the country for better market integration with ASEAN. The NLB \npresents  a  detailed  program  for  2010\u20132014,  and  encompasses  a  comprehensive  action  plan \nthat will require the participation and coordination of a large number of government departments \nand agencies. The NLB distinguishes quick wins and an overall strategy with priority actions for \nthe coming years. Some of the quick wins were included in the government\u2019s 100-day program \nimplemented since the beginning of 2010, such as the introduction of full time services in main \nseaports, the development of dry ports in major industrial areas, the extension of the railway into \nthe  port  of  Jakarta,  and  the  expansion  of  Jakarta  and  Surabaya  ports.  A  draft  presidential \ndecree to implement the NLB has been submitted for approval. (New policy action: completed.)  \n \n14. \nTax  administration  reform.  Continued  reform  in  tax  administration  has  increased \nregistered taxpayers from 4.8 million in 2006 to 18.1 million in 2010, but the increased number \nhas  not  led  to  larger  tax  collections.  The  next  phase  of  tax  administration  reform  will  continue \nthe  effort  to  reduce  tax  gaps  and  introduce  new  systems  and  procedures  that  facilitate  a \ntaxpayer-centered approach to improve voluntary compliance. The focus is on strengthening the \nself-assessment  system  and  streamlining  business  processes,  improving  the  quality  and \nintegrity  of  the  tax  database,  introducing  risk-based  compliance  enforcement,  improving \nprofessionalism  and  staff  integrity,  strengthening  governance,  and  increasing  the  information \nand communications technology capability to support the entire tax operations. To support this \neffort,  the  Directorate  General  of  Taxation  (DGT)  is  planning  to  implement  the  Project  for \nIndonesia  Tax  Administration  Reform  (PINTAR)  to  strengthen  (i)  taxpayer  registration, \n(ii) returns  and  payments  processing,  (iii)  the  taxpayer  and  revenue  accounts  database, \n(iv) centralized document management, (v) risk-based audit and collection, and (vi) information \ntechnology  infrastructure.  The  government  initially  planned  to  issue  a  contract  for  PINTAR  in \nmid-2010.  However,  the  completion  of  PINTAR  design  was  slightly  delayed.  DGT  has \nadvertised the procurement of the PINTAR; implementation is expected to begin in early 2011 to \nensure  that  the  reform  program  can  be  completed  as  scheduled  by  early  2014.  (Satisfactorily \ncompleted.)  \n \n2. \n \n15. \nThe  government  has  embarked  on  a  broad-based  and  ambitious  reform  agenda  since \nadopting a new regulatory framework for public finance management in 2003 and 2004.7 While \nprogress  has  been  substantial  and  reforms  are  moving  in  the  right  direction,  a  long  list  of \nchallenges  remains.  The  program  supports  efforts  to  advance  PFM  reform  focusing  on  a \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  and  performance-based  budgeting  (PBB),  better \ncash  forecasting  and  management,  an  integrated  financial  management  information  system, \nprocurement, management of state assets, and the audit systems. \n \n16. \nBudget program structure and indicative ceiling for 2011 budget. The State Finance \nLaw,  2003,  mandated  three  pillars  of  budget  reform:  (i)  a  unified  budget  to  remove  the \n\nStrengthen Public Financial Management and Governance  \n\n                                                 \n7   The most noteworthy laws issued include the State Finance Law No. 17/2003, the State Treasury Law No. 1/2004, \n\nand the State Financial Audit Law No. 15/2004. \n\n\ffor \ndistinction  between  development  expenditure  and  routine  expenditure,  and  allow \nprioritization across all kinds of expenditures in the budget; (ii) an MTEF that aims to strengthen \nthe capability to plan and prioritize expenditures for the medium term; and (iii) PBB, which would \nrestructure  the  budget  according  to  programs  and  activities  and  associated  performance \nindicators, and allow for results-based evaluation and budget allocation. The unified budget was \nimplemented in the 2005 budget. PBB and the  MTEF  moved into an implementation phase in \n2009 with the issuance of a manual prepared jointly by the Directorate General Budget and the \nNational  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  The  new  program  structure  has  been \nfinalized  and  incorporated  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014.  The  government  issued  Presidential \nDecree No. 5/2010 to regulate the establishment of the indicative ceilings for the 2011 budget \nbased on the revised structure. (Completed.) \n \nCash  forecasting.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  Regulation  No.192/2009  on  cash \n17. \nforecasting. With this new regulation, the idle cash balance kept at the Treasury Single Account \nat  the  Central  Bank  of  Indonesia  is  expected  to  be  minimized  and  the  interest  investment  of \ncash surpluses maximized. This regulation also requires spending units to submit in-year cash \nwithdrawal  plans  to  the  State  Treasury  Service  Office  (KPPN)  to  periodically  update  the \ndisbursement  plans  included  in  their  approved  budget  allocations  (DIPA).  The  spending  units \nare required to submit their updated cash plan at least 3 days before the end of each month, or \nthe cash cannot be withdrawn. A new information technology application has been developed to \nsupport this initiative. (Completed.) \n \n18. \nBusiness  process  improvement  and  chart  of  accounts.  A report covering the state \nbudget  and  state  treasury  business  process  improvement  was  completed  in  September  2010. \nThe  report  covers  areas  including  (i)  the  budget  planning  and  preparation  process,  (ii) budget \nenactment and budget revisions, (iii)  budget execution rules, (iv) revised budget structure and \nchart of accounts, and (v) project and activity costing. (Completed.) \n  \n19. \nDatabase for state assets management. Law No. 1/2004 on the state treasury and its \nimplementing  government  regulation  No.  6/  2006  on  state  or  local  government  assets  require \nthat  land  belonging  to  the  state  or  local  governments  shall  be  legally  registered  or  certified \nunder  the  name  of  the  central  government  or  respective  local  government.  Much  of  the  state-\nowned land is not yet registered or legally certified by the National Land Authority Board (BPN). \nIn  November  2009,  the  finance  minister  and  head  of  BPN  signed  two  joint  decrees  on  land \ncertification  (Decree  No.  186/2009  and  No.  24/2009)  that  provide  legal  certainty  on  the \nownership  of  state  land  and  protecting  the  security  of  state  assets.  The  stock-taking  and \nappraisal  process  of  state  assets  is  progressing.  A  completion  report\u2014for  all  civilian  state \nassets\u2014was submitted the President. (Satisfactorily completed.) \n  \n20. \nPublic  procurement.  The  past  3  years  have  witnessed  improvements  in  the  public \nprocurement environment. Presidential decree (Keppres) No. 80/2003 provided a national public \nprocurement regulation that meets most of what is generally regarded as accepted international \npractice,  including  basic  principles\u2014transparency,  open  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency. \nThis decree also paved the way for establishing the National Public Procurement Office (LKPP). \nA  key  priority  of  LKPP  is  to  improve  the  regulatory  framework  for  public  procurement.  In  this \neffort, LKPP is taking a two-pronged strategy: the preparation of a new procurement law and the \nrevision  of  Keppres  No.  80/2003.  LKPP  has  completed  the  academic  papers  on  the \nprocurement  law  and  public  consultation  has  started  on  the  draft  law.  The  preparation  and \nenactment  of  a  new  procurement  law  will  have  to  go  through  a  lengthy  process.  LKPP  has \nfinalized  a  new  Presidential  Regulation  No.  54/2010  to  replace  Keppres  80  as  an  interim \nmeasure,  which  requires  the  establishment  of  procurement  service  units,  the  use  of  national \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nstandard  bidding  documents,  and  other  improvement.  ADB  has  supported  the  government  in \nthis reform through technical assistance (TA, para. 28). (Completed.) \n \nInternal audit. The public expenditure and financial accountability assessment of 20088 \n21. \nclassifies  the  internal  audit  function  in  the  country  as  fragmented  and  characterized  by  weak \ncapacity. Presidential Regulation No. 60/2008 is the cornerstone for government internal control \nand  audit  systems.  Through  this  regulation  clarifies  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  various \nplayers in the internal audit such as the Financial and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP), \nInspectorate Generals, and local government inspectorates. However, there is still a need for a \nregulation  to  lay  out  in  more  detail  the  mechanisms  of  how  those  roles  and  responsibilities \nwould be implemented, particularly in the planning, executing, reporting and follow up of internal \naudit at each level. The DPSP-6 requires submission of a draft presidential decree for approval. \nThe  draft  presidential  decree  has  been  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  (Satisfactorily \ncompleted.)  \n \n22. \nAccrual-based  accounting.  Financial  reports  prepared  on  an  accrual  basis  are  more \neffective both for accountability and decision making. The government has made early progress \nin  this  area.  A  draft  presidential  regulation  on  Government  Accounting  Standards  and \nimplementation of accrual accounting was submitted for approval in July 2010. The target is to \nswitch to full accrual accounting by 2015. The draft standards is expected to be issued in late \n2010. (Completed.)  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhance Poverty Reduction and Access to Public Service Delivery   \n\n \n23. \nThe  government  has  implemented  a  number  of  programs  for  social  assistance  and \npoverty  reduction  across  all  clusters  in  the  past  5  years.  These  include  an  unconditional  cash \ntransfer program (BLT), conditional cash transfer, health insurance for the poor (JAMKESMAS) \nand the National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM Mandiri). ADB has supported the \ngovernment in this area through the PNPM Mandiri with an infrastructure focus.9 While progress \nhas  been  achieved  through  these  programs,  the  government  is  committed  to  intensify  policy \nreforms  in  this  area  to  accelerate  the  pace  of  poverty  reduction  over  the  next  5  years.  These \nreforms include institutionalizing program assessment and improved governance accountability \nto  support  overall  coordination,  implementation,  and  assessment  of  the  programs;  improving \naccuracy  in  measuring  poverty  and  developing  a  national  targeting  system  to  ensure  that \nprogram  benefits  reach  the  poor  and  vulnerable;  and  empowering  local  governments, \ncommunities,  and  service  providers  to  deliver  quality  services  as  an  effective  approach  to \nleverage  local  knowledge  to  identify  obstacles  to  development  while  building  capacity  for \ncoordinated action. \n \n24. \nGovernance and institutional accountability. Fragmentation and lack of coordination \nhave  limited  the  effectiveness  of  national  poverty  reduction  programs.  To  address  these \nproblems, the government has reorganized the institutional arrangements in this policy area. It \nissued  Presidential  Regulation  No.  15/2010  to  form  a  national  team  for  the  Acceleration  of \nPoverty Reduction (TNP2K), which consists of all the government agencies responsible for the \nplanning,  financing,  and  implementation  of  poverty  reduction  programs.  The  team  has  been \nestablished  to  guide  and  oversee  the  reform  of  poverty  reduction  policies  and  programs. \nChaired  by  the  vice  president,  the  team  will  lead  the  coordination  and  oversight  of  all  poverty \n                                                 \n8   World Bank. 2008.

The team \nwill  be  supported  by  an  executive  secretariat  responsible  for  preparing  policies  through  its \nworking groups that will act as internal think tanks to commission research, draft policies, and \nsupport improvements in program design and integration. One of the working groups will assess \nthe  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  poverty  reduction  programs  through  monitoring  and \nevaluation activities. The findings from both monitoring and evaluation activities will inform the \ndecision  of  the  national  team  about  program  mix,  scale,  and  budget  allocations.  (New  policy \naction: completed.)  \n \n25. \nUnified  database  for  poor  household  and  families.  Household  poverty  reduction \nprograms currently use different targeting approaches and rely on separate recipient databases. \nThis leads to duplication of efforts, inconsistency in application, and dampened program impact. \nTo  address  these  problems,  the  executive  secretariat  plans  to  establish  a  national  targeting \nsystem, which is one of the strategic objectives of the RPJMN, 2010\u20132014. Such a system will \nfeature  a  unified  database  of  poor  households,  from  which  implementing  agencies  can  draw \nbeneficiary  lists  for  individual  programs.  TNP2K  has  issued  a  policy  note  recommending  the \nestablishment  of  a  national  unified  database  of  poor  households  and  families  and  national \ntargeting  system,  including  steps  involved  and  agencies  participating  in  the  process.  The \nprogram  initially  only  required  preparation  of  a  budget  submission  for  this  initiative  for  2011. \n(Completed.) \n \n26.  Methodology  of  calculating  poverty  line.    The  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS)  is \nrevising the methodology of poverty line calculation and will expand the list of indicators from 14 \nto 56. This will improve the accuracy in identifying the poor and measuring poverty rates. The \nrevision of national poverty line methodology will involve (i) completion of national poverty line \nsimulation using the alternative measurement, and (ii) conducting internal consultation to review \nthe  new  method  between  BPS  and  key  government  stakeholders.  (New  policy  action: \ncompleted.) \n \nCommunity-based  poverty  reduction  programs.  The  fiduciary  systems  of  the \n27. \nprogram have come under stress with the national expansion of the PNPM Mandiri. To ensure \nthat  the  fiduciary  systems  remain  robust,  the  government  has  developed  an  action  plan  with \nspecific  deliverables,  including  (i)  communication  of  political  will  with  zero  tolerance  on  fraud \nand corruption; (ii) strengthening of systems to monitor, report, and act on fraud and corruption \ncases;  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  capacity  through  the  involvement  of  the  attorney  general, \nBawasda (Regional Development Supervisory Body), and through the appointment of additional \nfiduciary  staff  in  high-risk  areas.  Another  specific  action  plan  is  to  publish  complaints,  case \ndetails,  and  resolution  status.  In  addition,  the  government  has  made  a  formal  agreement \nbetween  BPKP  and  related  regional  agencies  to  support  BPKP  in  PNPM  audits.  A \nmemorandum  of  understanding  for  audit  of  the  PNPM  in  2010  was  signed  by  all  parties  in \nAugust 2010. To monitor all the corruption cases, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry \nof Public Works submit quarterly reports detailing the status of the cases to the national team \nand to the Joint Management Committee members.

To support PFM reform at the local government level, \nADB  has  provided  capacity  building  TA  linked  to  the  Local  Government  Financial  and \nGovernance  Reform  Program  series.  The  second  subprogram  of  the  Local  Government \nFinancial  and  Governance  Reform  Program  cluster  is  scheduled  for  consideration  by  ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors in 2011. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nimpact,  the  importance  of  sectors covered,  investment  needs,  and  indicative  costs  of  reforms.   \nThe  policy  actions  of  the  proposed  program  are  derived  from  the  government\u2019s  medium-term \nreform  priorities  as  set  out  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014.  They  are  crucial  in  achieving  the \ngovernment\u2019s  pro-growth,  pro-jobs,  and  pro-poor  strategy.  Implementation  of  some  policy \nreforms  also  requires  investments  such  as  the  NSW,  enhancing  tax  administration,  increasing \naudit capacity, and simplifying investment licenses. Reduction of income and corporate tax rates \nintroduces  adjustment  costs  that  need  to  be  recovered  through  improved  tax  administration. \nWith increased focus on poverty reduction, the government will also scale up spending on social \nassistance  and  poverty  programs  such  as  the  PNPM  Mandiri  and  other  social  assistance \nprograms. The government\u2019s budget financing needs for 2010 are an estimated $20.4 billion, of \nwhich  programmed  official  external  borrowing  amounts  to  $7.7 billion.  The  government  has \nrequested  a  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the \nprogram.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these \nterms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The World Bank \nwill provide parallel cofinancing support of $600 million through its DPL-7 and the Government \nof Japan will provide $100 million.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n30. \nThe  CMEA  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  program,  collaborating  closely  with  the \nMinistry of Finance. Implementation of the DPSP-6 actions is being undertaken by a number of \nother ministries and agencies, including the Vice President\u2019s Office, the National Development \nPlanning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  the  Investment  Coordination  Board,  several  directorates \ngeneral in the Ministry of Finance, BPS, and the National Public Procurement Agency, among \nothers.  Extensive  consultations  were  held  between  the  development  partners  (ADB,  the \nGovernment of Japan, and the World Bank) and the government, led by a steering committee \nchaired  by  the  CMEA  on  formulating  the  policy  actions.  Monitoring  the  implementation  and \nattainment  of  the  DPSP  policy  actions  is  done  through  several  mechanisms.  These  include \nmonitoring  committees  and/or  technical  groups  established  by  the  government  that  are \nresponsible for ensuring the implementation of policy actions as well as follow-up on progress; \nand  regular  joint  government\u2013development  partner  meetings  to  discuss  interim  progress  in \nachieving agreed milestones in the reform agenda. The program period is from November 2009 \nto December 2010; the program loan of $200 million is to be disbursed when the government \nhas  met  the  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.11  \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\f \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\nA. \n \nIn almost all areas of PFM, changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are largely \n31. \ncomplete  and  the  momentum  has  shifted  toward  implementation  of  new  PFM  practices. \nAdvances have been made in budget preparation with the introduction of the MTEF and PBB, \ngovernment accounting standards have been formally established and are being adhered to in \nseveral respects to produce comprehensive annual financial statements, and the external audit \nfunction  has  made  significant  progress  in  the  past  5  years.  However,  challenges  remain, \nincluding  (i)  improving  internal  controls  in  the  execution  of  budget  by  spending  agencies;  (ii) \nestablishing  the  government  financial  management  information  system,  which  provides \ninformation  for  budget  management  at  all  levels  of  the  government;  and  (iii) strengthening \ncontrols in budget execution processes to fully realize the gains from reforms introduced in other \nareas of PFM. The government continues to prioritize PFM reforms and development partners \nsupport implementation of reforms in this area. When implemented, the reforms will contribute \nto  reducing  the  level  of  fiduciary  risk  to  low  in  the  medium  term.  The  World  Bank  considers \nIndonesia\u2019s  PFM  system  to  be  adequate  to  receive  DPL  and  DPSP  support.  A  detailed \nassessment  of  the  attendant  fiduciary  risks  with  respect  to  this  DPSP  operation  is  accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n32. \nwith the Government of Indonesia and the CMEA.  \n \nB. \n \n33. \nBoth the improvement of the investment climate and strengthening of PFM systems are \nexpected  to  have  significant  poverty  and  social  benefits.  The  measures  aimed  at  increasing \ninvestment  (including  foreign  direct  investment)  and  raising  export  competitiveness  are \ndesigned to support a virtuous cycle of growth, job generation, and productivity gains leading to \nopportunities,  improved  livelihoods,  and  poverty  reduction.  Simplification  of  the  business \nlicensing  procedures  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  growth  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises,  which  can  have  a  great  impact  on  employment.  Tax  reform  actions  that  will \ncontribute  to  increased  revenue  collection  and  better  fiscal  management  will  allow  the \ngovernment  to  dedicate  more  resources  to  pro-poor  programs.  Improvements  in  budget \npreparation  and  budget  execution  systems  are  expected  to  lead  to  more  efficient  service \ndelivery and will allow social programs to have a greater impact on the targeted population. The \npolicy reforms supported under the DPSP-6 have the potential to benefit women through other \ninitiatives  on  poverty  reduction  and  service  delivery  in  line  with  the  government  priorities,  as \nstated  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014.  Improved  PFM  capacity  will  facilitate  implementation  of  a \ngender-responsive  budget  currently  being  pilot  tested  in  a  number  of  key  ministries.  ADB  has \nsupported the government\u2019s poverty program through the PNPM Mandiri. The policy actions to \nsupport  improvement  in  implementation  of  PNPM  Mandiri  under  the  DPSP-6  will  enhance \nwomen\u2019s capacity in raising their voice in local development planning and processes.  \n \nC. \n \n34. \nThe  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following are agreed upon, \nand  will  be  incorporated  in  the  legal  agreement.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \n\nSafeguards \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nprogram. The government agrees to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations,  and  entities  involved  in  implementing  the  program  to  cooperate  fully  with  any \nsuch investigation and extend all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books \nand records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nThe  program  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014.  The  assumptions \nunderlying the program include the following: (i) domestic political and macroeconomic stability \nis  maintained,  (ii)  the  economy  is  able  to  withstand  external  economic  shocks,  and  (iii)  the \ngovernment  retains  the  reform  momentum  and  is  able  to  forge  a  consensus  among  relevant \nagencies and the public on the reform agenda. The program has three main risks (Table 1). \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk \nUnanticipated global or regional \nshocks may affect Indonesia\u2019s \neconomy \n \n \nWeak interagency coordination \ncapacity \n\nCapacity constraints slow the pace \nof policy reforms and reduce the \nquality of outputs \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government is undertaking measures to strengthen its monetary policy \nframework, expand the tax base, and strengthen public expenditure \nmanagement, with the assistance of development partners including the \nAsian Development Bank. \n\nThe program reduces this risk by focusing on the policy triggers that \nconstitute high-priority, high-impact policy reforms with some meaningful \ndegree of implementing capacity. Increasing external competition and \nincreased public demand for a better development outcome provide an \nopportunity to build consensus among stakeholders on difficult policy reform \nissues and accelerate structural reforms to strengthen economic growth. \nThe program focuses on efforts to support the government\u2019s own initiatives \nand reforms in areas where there is political will. The development partners \nprovide ongoing technical assistance in key areas of reforms. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCE \n\n36. \nThe government and the CMEA have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n37. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Sixth Development Policy Support Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n19 November 2010 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nHigher pro-poor economic \ngrowth that is sustained \nover the medium term \n\nOutcome \nImproved overall \neconomic management \nanchored on good \ngovernance \n\nOutputs  \n1.
