The  key  impediments  to  more  inclusive  growth  are  insufficient \ntransport and other basic infrastructure, as well as limited institutional capacity. To improve the \nefficiency of public investment and maximize the benefits of economies of scale and synergies \nwith ongoing or planned projects, the Government of Viet Nam is advocating an integrated area \napproach  under  which  neighboring  localities  will  work  toward  common  development  goals, \neconomies  of  scale,  and  jointly  enhanced  competitiveness.  This  approach  characterizes  the \ndesign philosophy of the project, which will address the key impediments to inclusive growth. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  VDTA  is  the  largest  agricultural  producer  in  the  CLV-DTA,  and  its  five  main \nindustrial crops are coffee, rubber, pepper, cassava, and cashew kernels, which are traded on \ninternational  commodity  markets.  Despite  overall  poverty  reduction  and the  steady  increase  in \nagricultural  production  and  exports  since  the  1990s,  VDTA  provinces  still  face  development \nchallenges,  such  as  slow  growth,  persistent  income  and  non-income  inequality  of  vulnerable \nand  disadvantaged  groups,  and  low  competitiveness.  Of  the  VDTA\u2019s  population  of  5,114,780 \npeople, 33% are ethnic minorities and about 77% relies on agriculture as their main source of \nlivelihood. In 2014, the gross domestic product per capita in the VDTA was $1,683, about 80% \nof the national average. The average poverty rate for VDTA\u2019s ethnic minorities was about 19% \nagainst the national average of about 6% for all ethnic groups, indicating that ethnic minorities \nare  not  fully  benefiting  from  development  advances  including  social  services  as  well  as \neconomic  assets  and  opportunities.3 Transport  connectivity  within  both  CLV-DTA  and  VDTA \nremains inadequate partly due to the difficulty in mobilizing funds for infrastructure investment. \nSome progress has been made in signing and implementing CLV-DTA cross border trade and \nbusiness  agreements  but  still  limited  to  certain  border  gates,  and  mostly  on  the  Vietnamese \nside.  The  institutional  capacity  of  VDTA  provinces  in  formulating  and  implementing  their \ndevelopment strategies including investment planning and participation in regional cooperation \nis weak. For example, all VDTA provinces but Dak Lak were ranked among the 20 lowest of all \n63  provinces  on  the  provincial  competitiveness  index  which  assesses  the  ease  of  doing \nbusiness, economic governance, and administrative reforms by the provincial governments.4  \n \n4. \n These  challenges  and  constraints  are  primarily  due  to  (i)  inadequate  physical \ninfrastructure  and  poor  road  conditions,  (ii)  untapped  business  and  livelihood  development \nopportunities,  and  (iii)  weak  institutional  capacity  for  investment  planning  and  resource \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project  preparatory technical assistance  for the Support to Border \n\nAreas Development Project (TA 8849-VIE). \n\n3  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4   The Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce. 2015.

The  project  will  help  the  VDTA  overcome  these  constraints  and  contribute  to \nCLV-DTA  objectives  by  (i)  improving  the  transport  connectivity  and  safety;  (ii)  supporting \ntransport  and  trade  facilitation  (TTF);  (iii)  promoting  inclusive,  community-based  tourism;  and \n(iv) strengthening provincial capacity for more strategic investment planning and efficient project \nintegrated  area  approach  will  diversify  economic  and  employment \nmanagement.  This \nopportunities for rural communes by connecting them to increasing trade and passenger flows. \n \n5. \nRelated  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan, 2016\u20132020,5 which aims to expand the domestic market, promote \nexport,  and  sustain  trading  surpluses.  More  specifically,  the  development  plan  proposes  to  (i) \nstrengthen  domestic  markets  and  promote  exports  by  more  closely  linking  production, \nprocessing,  and  distribution;  (ii)  improve  the  quality  and  competitiveness  of  local  products, \nespecially  those  that  can  be  identified  as  a  Viet  Nam  \u201ctrademark\u201d;  and  (iii)  more  fully  utilize \nexisting and potential incentives through trade agreements. \n \n6. \nThe project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2020 and its \nmidterm  review, 6 which  aim  to  (i)  improve  physical  connectivity,  (ii)  expand  the  quality  and \ncoverage of basic infrastructure to help create jobs for poor persons and ethnic minorities living \nin  underdeveloped  areas,  and  (iii)  build  capacity  for  decentralized  public  sector  management. \nThese  aims  converge  with  the  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020 \nfor  Viet  Nam:  (i)  the  promotion  of  job  creation  and  competitiveness,  (ii)  enhanced  and  more \ninclusive infrastructure and service delivery, and (iii) improved environmental sustainability and \nclimate  change  response.7 The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan, \n2017\u20132019 for Viet Nam.8 \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  galvanize  ADB\u2019s  long-term  commitment  to  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  economic  cooperation  program  by  promoting  closer  integration  and \ncooperation  among  cross-border  areas  within  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic, \nand Viet Nam.9 It is consistent with the GMS Transport and Trade Facilitation Action Plan, the \nupdated  CLV-DTA  master  plan,10 and  the  government\u2019s  transport  development  strategy.11 The \nproject also fits well with the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy12 and the government\u2019s Strategy for \nTourism  Development  in  Viet  Nam  until  2020,  Vision  to  203013.  Overall,  it  will  contribute  to \nexpanding  market  opportunities  as  envisaged  by  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \nEconomic Community. \n \n8. \nLessons.  The  project  has  considered  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  recent  transport  projects, \nincluding  (i)  the  importance  of  national  and  subregional  transport  efficiency,  which  will  help \n                                                \n5  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2016.

The  project  has  integrated \nlessons from ADB\u2019s successful GMS tourism sector assistance program and completed projects \nin  Viet  Nam,  including  the  need  to  (i)  analyze  tourism  demand  in  project  areas  to  guide  the \nselection  of  investments;  (ii)  improve  cross-sector  coordination  and  build  synergies  with  other \nADB assistance; and (iii) carry out capacity-building programs to provide livelihood opportunities \nfor poor rural and ethnic minority households, especially those led by women.15 \n \nADB has been the most active development partner in supporting provinces within and \n9. \nadjacent  to  the  VDTA  as  part  of  its  operational  prioritization  of  the  country\u2019s  central  highlands \ninvolving  wide  sector  coverage.  ADB  will  follow  the  government\u2019s  focus  on  an  area-wide \napproach, with the project as the first intervention to help the VDTA become a regional cluster \nwith  shared  development  objectives.  Greater  synergies  will  be  achieved  with  ongoing  and \nplanned  support  by  ADB,  such  as  the  Productive  Rural  Infrastructure  Sector  Project  in  the \nCentral  Highlands  (approved  in  2013) 16 and  the  Water  Efficiency  Improvement  for  Drought-\nAffected Provinces (proposed for 2018), as well as support from other development partners. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe impact will be an established engine and gateway within the five VDTA provinces to \nwider  regional  and  international  markets.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  movement  of  goods, \nvehicles, and people among the five VDTA provinces. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Road  infrastructure  in  the  five  Viet  Nam  Development  Triangle  Area \nprovinces  rehabilitated.  The  poor  condition  of  critical  roads  constrains  economic  activities, \nincluding employment and income opportunities in all VDTA provinces. The project will improve \nphysical connectivity  within and among the five provinces by upgrading national and provincial \nroads,  as  well  as  strategic  roads  that  link  the  VDTA  road  network  to  border  crossings  with \nCambodia  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  The  roads  were  selected  using  a \nmulticriteria prioritization filter to ensure the greatest impact.17 Traffic is expected to increase as \nroad  conditions  improve,  and  appropriate  civil  works  designs  and  road  safety  awareness \nprograms  will  be  provided  to  mitigate  the  higher  risk  of  accidents.  The  project  will  provide \ntargeted traffic and road safety training to the most vulnerable road users. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n14  For example, the GMS Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway\u2014the country\u2019s longest expressway, which opened in 2014\u2014has \nhalved travel times; reduced traffic accidents by 60%; and boosted the cross-border movement of vehicles, goods, \nand travelers to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n15  Independent Evaluation Department. 2009.

This output will stimulate \ninclusive economic activity by preparing an action plan to implement the CLV-DTA master plan \nand  TTF  agreements,  taking  into  account  ongoing  and  proposed  TTF  considerations  under \nother  regional  frameworks,  such  as  the  GMS.  The  action  plan  will  help  project  executing  and \nimplementing agencies incorporate gender, ethnic minority, climate change, and environmental \naspects  into  integrated  area  development  planning  and  execution.  This  soft  infrastructure \nsupport  supplements  the  rehabilitated  physical  connectivity  by  easing  the  movement  of  goods \nand  people  across  borders,  which  will  strengthen  backward  and  forward  links  among  agro-\nprocessing and other industries. \n \n13. \nThe  benefits  of  improved  transport  connectivity  will  be  harnessed  further  by  promoting \npro-poor, ethnic-inclusive tourism to boost trade in goods and services. Provincial tourism plans \nprioritize  inclusive,  community-based,  pro-poor  tourism,  and  seven  tourism  subprojects  have \nbeen  selected  for  investment  in  Binh  Phuoc,  Dak  Lak,  Dak  Nong,  and  Kon  Tum. 18 These \nprojects  will  include  (i)  small  infrastructure  improvements,  such  as  water  supply,  solid  waste, \nand  wastewater  management  facilities;  (ii)  rural  access  road  improvements,  pathways,  trails, \nand  drainage;  and  (iii)  the  provision  of  related  training  to  strengthen  the  business-enabling \nenvironment  and  provide  new  livelihood  opportunities  for  poor  rural  and  ethnic  minority \nhouseholds. \n \n14. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  an  ongoing  regional  technical \nassistance  project19 to  help  the  VDTA  integrate  aspects  related  to  the  protection  and  use  of \nnatural resources 20 into the strategic planning and development of the VDTA master plan. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  capacity  for  investment  planning,  project  design  and \nimplementation, and resource management strengthened. This output will help improve the \nefficiency of broad investment planning, project management, and small business development \nwithin the VDTA provinces in line with the VDTA\u2019s long-term development objective to become a \nstronger and more cohesive economic area. Activities include (i) institutional strengthening and \ntraining  for  officials  appointed  by  the  VDTA  provinces  to  implement  the  action  plans,  and  (ii) \ncapacity  development  and  business  support  programs  for  local  entrepreneurs,  especially \nwomen  and  ethnic  minorities,  to  develop  and  operate  small  and  micro-enterprises  such  as \naccommodation,  agro-  and  food  processing,  food  and  beverage  services,  tourism  transport \nservices, handicraft production, and other cultural industries. \n \nD. \n \n16. \ncategory and financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).21 \n \n17. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR76.84 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $122.11 million.

The  five  VDTA  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees  (PPCs)  will  be  the  executing  agencies;  they  have  nominated  their  departments  of \nplanning and investment as the implementing agencies, and will appoint a provincial department \nto be responsible for the provincial project management units (PPMUs). The PPMUs, which will \nbe  supported  by  project  implementation  consultants, 24  will  manage  the  day-to-day  project \nimplementation  and,  with  ADB\u2019s  prior  concurrence,  will  appoint  the  PPMU's  key  professional \nstaff and assign qualified support staff. At the commune level, the project will coordinate closely \nwith the existing local administrations, utilizing the commune people's committee as the project \npoint  of  liaison.  The  communication  and  participation  plan  and  gender  action  plan  provide \nguidance  to  ensure  that  project  stakeholders  are  appropriately  engaged.  The  PPMUs  will \ncooperate closely with commune personnel in (i) organizing public consultations, (ii) monitoring \ndesign  and  implementation,  and  (iii)  creating  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  with  commune \nsupervision boards (CSBs).25 \n\n                                                \n24 The  terms  of  reference  for  the  implementation  consultants  are  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n25 The CSBs will include at least one female representative. \n\n6 \n\nE. \n \n19. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nEngineering solutions are based on whole life cost considerations that take into account \n21. \nthe project\u2019s technical feasibility, cost, durability, affordability, and environmental aspects, such \nas  adequacy  of  embankment  height,  drainage  and  erosion  control,  for  addressing  extreme \nweather conditions. Standards and best practices that the contractors and local authorities are \nfamiliar  with  are  used  to  eliminate  delays.  Contract  packaging  has  been  tailored  to  attract \nqualified  contractors  and  capacity-building  programs  will  help small  entrepreneurs  improve the \nbusiness-enabling environment. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  each  of  the  five  road  subprojects.  The  benefits \nquantified  for  output  1  come  from  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  and  time  savings.  The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  for  the  provincial  subprojects  are  18.7%  (Gia  Lai), \n16.4% (Dak Lak), 12.3% (Dak Nong), 12.2% (Kon Tum), and 13.1% (Binh Phuoc). The output 1 \ninvestment is assessed as feasible across all subprojects, with an EIRR of 14.5%. \n \nThe  benefits  quantified  for  output  2  are  derived  from  the  incremental  increase  in  the \n23. \nnumber  of  visitors  to  the  tourist  sites  (footnote  18),  visitor  spending,  and  additional  revenues \narising from the  homestay  business. The  estimated  EIRR  of the tourism  subprojects  averages \n15.4%, declining to 14.1% if the capacity strengthening costs under output 2 are included. \n \n24. \nThe project\u2019s economic viability was tested by combining the net cash flows of outputs 1 \nand 2, the costs of output 3, and project management overhead. The overall project was found \nto be economically feasible, with an EIRR of 13.9%.26 \n \n25. \nFinancial  viability. A projection of the financial position of the five provinces for 2017\u2013\n2026  has  been  prepared.  Revenue  and  expenditures  have  been  conservatively  projected  to \ngrow annually over this period at the local inflation rate of 5% or, if higher, to follow past growth \ntrends.  The  dong  is  expected  to  depreciate  by  5%  each  year.  The  projections  include  the \nprovincial project investment, ADB loan proceeds utilized, counterpart contribution, debt service \nrepayment  on  the  subloan,  and  adequate  O&M  for  the  sustainable  operation  of  the  project \ninfrastructure. The financial  analysis  showed  that the  provinces  can  afford the  project,  as they \ncan provide the counterpart contribution, provide adequate O&M for sustainable operation, and \nrepay  the  debt  service  on  the  subloan.  The  annual  counterpart  contribution  and  combined \nannual O&M plus debt service are individually less than 1% of total state budget expenditures. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  indicates  that  the  project-specific  risks,  which \nare generally moderate, can be reduced to low with appropriate mitigation measures, involving \nthe appointment of experienced and qualified staff to the PPMU, technical support, and training \nin  ADB  procedures.27 Each  PPMU  will  (i)  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  by \nfunding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  under  the  project,  (ii)  cause  the  detailed  project \naccounts to be audited following international auditing standards and ADB\u2019s requirements by an \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB, and (iii) involve the CSBs to ensure their participation in \nmonitoring subproject implementation \n \n27. \nThe financing allocations and components that must follow ADB procedures have been \narranged taking into account the PPCs\u2019 limited experience and capacity for managing externally \nfunded projects. All procurement of goods and civil works and recruitment of consultants to be \nfinanced by the ADB loan must follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe  government\u2019s  public  procurement  regulations  (as  acceptable  to  ADB)  will  be  applied  for \npackages procured using national competitive bidding and shopping procedures. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  about  225,000  people,  including  12,400  ethnic  minority \nbeneficiaries  of  tourism  subprojects  (footnote  3).  The  poverty  rate  in  the  VDTA  provinces, \nexcept  for  Binh  Phuoc,  is  higher  than  the  national  average.  Ethnic  minorities  represent  a \nrelatively larger share of the poor population, with many just above the poverty level and highly \nvulnerable to unpredicted events. Poverty is attributed to (i) a lack of land, labor, and credit, and \nlimited production knowledge and trade skills, especially on the part of poor ethnic women who \nhave limited education; and (ii) poor basic infrastructure, which hampers economic development \nby  creating  high  costs  throughout  value  chains  such  as  agriculture  and  tourism.  The  project\u2019s \nroad  investments  will  expand  economic  opportunities  to  benefit  all,  while  the  tourism \ninvestments will benefit the rural poor, especially ethnic minorities. \n \nGender.  The  project  is categorized  effective  gender mainstreaming.  A gender  analysis \n30. \nrevealed  that  women  have  fewer  opportunities  than  men  to  participate  in  public  decision-\nmaking,  and  less  access  to  information,  training,  and  employment,  especially  during  the  low \nagricultural  season.  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  that  promotes  (i)  equality  of  project \nbenefits and opportunity-sharing between men and women; (ii) reduction in gender inequalities \nand  social  risks  (HIV/AIDS  transmission  prevention,  human  trafficking  prevention,  and  road \nsafety);  (iii)  training  of  women,  including  those  from  ethnic  minorities,  on  technical  topics, \nincluding tourism service deliveries; (iv) increased representation of women in decision-making \nbodies; and (v) collection of sex-disaggregated data for benefit monitoring and evaluation.28 \n \nE. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the \n31. \noverall  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  developments  and \nimprovements under the subprojects are unlikely to trigger major resettlement impacts because \nmost of the infrastructure will be improved within existing rights-of-way (ROWs). As a result, the \nprimary  points  of  concern  will  be  minor  land  acquisition  and  compensation  for  roadside  trees, \ncrops,  or  small  structures  that  may  be  affected  within  the  ROW.  The  PPCs  and  ADB  have \nagreed on a combined resettlement and ethnic minorities development plan (REMDP).29 Minor \nland acquisition, compensation, allowances, operation and administration, surveys, monitoring, \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Resettlement and Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fand reporting will be financed by government counterpart funds. The internal monitor will ensure \nthat the resettlement process and impacts are evaluated properly and timely reported to ADB. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Based on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement (2009),  the  overall \nproject  is  classified  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples.  Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the \nproject  areas  are  overwhelmingly  positive  since  the  subprojects  will  be  aimed  at  the  overall \neconomic  and  social  improvement  of  the  total  population.  The  project  will  not  cause  physical \ndisplacement from traditional or customary lands, nor negatively impact the identity, culture, or \ncustomary  livelihood  system  of  ethnic  minorities.  The  REMDP  will  be  used  to  ensure  the \ninclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  and  their  access  to  project  benefits.  The  REMDP  also  includes \nmitigation  measures  to  address  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  an  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment  program,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism.  It  also  complies  with  ADB \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements.  The  seven  tourism  subprojects  are \nassessed category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n33. \nEnvironment. Based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the overall project is \nclassified category B. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs)30 were prepared for each of the \nfive road subprojects. The IEEs found only a few significant adverse impacts, none of which is \nirreversible.  All  road  works  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  within  existing  ROWs,  and  no \ncivil  works  will  be  carried  out  in  sensitive  biodiversity  areas.  The  environmental  management \nplans, included in the IEEs, will be updated during the detailed design of the  road subprojects \nand  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  ADB.  The  five  tourism  subprojects  under  output  2  involve  the \nconstruction of small infrastructure in the villages to improve tourist destinations, and will cause \nminor or no environmental impacts. During project implementation, parallel to the preparation of \nthe  detailed  designs,  rapid  environmental  assessments  to  be  agreed  with  ADB  will  be  carried \nout  to  reconfirm  the  tourism  subprojects  as  category  C.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessment was prepared based on climate projections downscaled within the VDTA.31 \n \nF. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and management plan.32 With the mitigation measures, the overall risk is \nconsidered medium, and the project\u2019s benefits and impacts will outweigh the estimated costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nin \n\nRegional and local coordination \nDelays \nimplementing  CLV-DTA \ntransport  and  trade  agreements,  the \ninability \nstakeholders \nengage \neffectively  on  strategies  and  priorities, \nand difficulty in mobilizing and retaining \nqualified and trained staff. \n\nto \n\nPublic financial management \nWeak budget planning, which can lead \nallocation \nto \ninstitutional \ndecisions, \ncapacity,  and \narrangements  and \n\ninadequate \n\nsuboptimal \n\nbudget \n\nthe \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB  will  remain  closely  engaged  with  and  actively  support  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nparticipation \nintegration \nin  subregional  economic  cooperation  and \nprograms, including  those  related  to  transport  and  trade  facilitation.  The \nproject  will  specifically  support \nimplementation  of  CLV-DTA \nagreements  by  training  and  motivating  provincial  officials  for  better \ninvestment  planning  and  project  management,  and  beneficiaries  in \nbusiness  development  and \nin \ninclusive tourism. \nADB  assistance,  particularly  programmed  policy-based  loans,  will  help \nimprove  public  financial  management  systems,  while  the  project  will \nbenefit  from  tried-and-tested  procedures  and  measures  established \nunder the ADB portfolio.

At  the  project  level,  ADB  will \nencourage  PPMUs  to  engage  accounting  support  to  ensure  timely \nrecord-keeping  and  reconciliation,  and  strict  adherence  to  financial \nmanagement  policies  and  internal  controls.  The  project\u2019s  procurement \nplan  proposes  fewer  and  larger  packages  to  reduce  the  number  of \ntransactions. \n\nADB  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  Amended  Law  on  Anti-\nCorruption of 2012, which includes guidelines on increased transparency \nand  accountability  of  public  agencies  and  officials.  ADB-funded  PPMUs \nwill establish and strengthen mechanisms to mitigate the risk of seeking \npersonal  gain.  ADB  will  provide  continuous  support \nfor  capacity \ndevelopment and resources for accountability institutions. \nThe project design includes targeted ADB financing of specific items that \nare  easily  measured  and  monitored  (infrastructure  and  consulting \nservices).  The  executing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  identifying  key \nproject staff and will allow ADB to review their qualifications as outlined in \nthe  PAM.
