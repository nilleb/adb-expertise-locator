The  plan \n(NDP) \nNational  Development  Plan \nencourages  strategies  that  are  market-based  and  actively  promote \ncompetition,  innovation,  and  the  development  of  PPPs.  To  foster \ngreater  private  sector  participation, \nthe \ngovernment and the private sector working as partners to (i) provide \nopportunities  for  MSMEs  to  participate  in  a  more  competitive \nenvironment; and (ii) to maximize the potential of PPP, with a view to \nincreasing private investment. \n \nIn  alignment  with  the  NDP,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ncountry  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  the  Maldives  prioritizes \nsupport \nthe  ADB  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s  validation  report  of  the  country  strategy  and  program \ncompletion  report  as  well  as  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Private \nSector Development and Operations. ADB will thus primarily focus on \ndeveloping  an  enabling  environment  for  MSMEs  and  help  build \ncapacity  for  the  introduction  of  PPPs  in  line  with  the  PSD  strategy \nand \nin  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment.  \n \n(TA)  on  MSME  development \nThe  ADB \nconducted a survey to identify factors impeding private sector activity. \nMajor obstacles include (i) high cost and limited access to finance, (ii) \n\nthe  plan  envisages \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\nfor  PSD. \n\nfollows \n\nIt \n\n \nBorrower \n \nProposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nSocial Sector \nAssessment \n\n \nRationale \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nasymmetries  of  market  information  and  business-related  expertise \namong MSMEs, (iii) lack of infrastructure including poorly developed \ninter-island transportation and high cost of power generation, and (iv) \nlack  of  skilled  labor.  These  factors  are  to  be  addressed  under  the \nPSDP.  \n \nMoreover,  even  though  the  Maldives  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing \neconomies  in  South  Asia,  the  benefits  of  growth  have  not  been \nequitably  distributed  among  the  people.  Income  disparities  between \nhouseholds  in  Mal\u00e9  and  those  in  remote  atolls  are  large.  Economic \nactivity is constrained by the dispersed population residing in various \natolls, leading to inefficiencies and diseconomies of scale. In addition, \nweak  institutional  capacity  and  human  resource  deficiencies  are \nconstraints across the entire spectrum of the development process in \nthe Maldives.  \n \nthe  Government \nTo  ameliorate  domestic  regional \nidentified  regional  economic  growth  and  diversification  as  key \nobjectives  of  economic  development  in  both  the  6th NDP  for  2001\u2013\n2005 and the current 7th NDP for the northern, north central, central, \nsouth  central,  and  southern  regions  of  the  Maldives.  As  part  of  its \nplan,  the  Government  is  attempting  to  develop  infrastructure  in \noutlying  atolls  by  developing  domestic  regional  centers  designed  to \nhave  airports,  ports,  and  other  infrastructure  facilities.  This  is \nexpected  to  foster  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities \nin the MSME subsector.  \n \nHowever, due to its limited financial capacity and the need to ensure \nefficient services, the Government is pursuing PPPs for infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n \n\ninequalities, \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  intended  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  developed  and  expanded \nMSME  subsector  leading  to  broad-based,  private  sector-led,  and \nsustainable inclusive growth. The intended outcomes are (i) enhanced \naccess  to  finance  by  MSMEs  by  providing  Bank  of  Maldives  (BML) \nwith a line of credit facility (LCF) to pilot credit assistance to MSMEs in \ndesignated  regions,  (ii)  enhanced  access  to  markets,  technology  and \ninformation  and  strengthened  capacity  of  MSMEs \nthe \nestablishment  of  business  development  services  centers  (BDSC)  and \na cost-sharing facility (CSF) designed to meet their special needs, and \n(iii) improved support infrastructure through PPPs. \n \nThe \nincluding \ncontingencies.  ADB  will  finance  $7.5  million  equivalent  to  cover \n96.2%  of  the  cost,  and  the  Government  will  finance  $0.3  million \n(3.8%).  The  cost  breakdown  is  (i)  component  A:  BDSC  and  CSF \noperations  and  related  capacity  development  ($1.9  million);  (ii) \ncomponent  B:  LCF  and  related  capacity  development,  credit \ninformation bureau (CIB), and central moveable assets registry ($3.9 \nmillion); and (iii) component C: PPPs ($1.4 million), plus contingency \nand interest charges ($0.6 million).  \n\n \nCost Estimate and \nFinancing Plan \n\nis  estimated  at  $7.8  million, \n\ntotal  project  cost \n\nthrough \n\n\fLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting and \nImplementing \nAgencies \n\n \nProcurement and \nConsulting Services \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nA  loan  in  special  drawing  rights,  equivalent  to  $7.5million,  will  be \nprovided  from  ADB\u2018s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a \nfixed  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The \ninterest rate charge will be 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n31 August 2011 \n \n28 February 2011 \n\nthe  procurement  plan  and  ADB  will  review \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency.  The  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  will  be  (i)  the  Ministry  of \nEconomic  Development  and  Trade  (MEDT)  for  component  A  (MSME \npromotion);  (ii)  BML  for  component  B,  subcomponent  1  (LCF  and \ncapacity  development);  (iii)  Maldives  Monetary  Authority  (MMA)  for \ncomponent  B,  subcomponent  2  (CIB  and  central  moveable  assets \nregistry);  and  the  PPP  cell  in  MEDT\u2019s  Enterprise  Development  Unit \n(EDU) for component C (PPP). \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Selection  of \nconsulting  firms  for  consulting  services  will  use  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method.  The  Government  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  procedures,  documents,  bid  evaluations,  award \nrecommendations,  and  contract  in  accordance  with  the  agreed \nprocedures. \n \nCounterpart funds will be used for the BDSC operations, office space, \ncounterpart  staff,  communications,  administrative  support,  and \ncontingencies. \n \nAround 200\u2013300 enterprises in the northern and southern regions are \nexpected  to  receive  training  and  technical support  on  a  cost-sharing \nbasis  to  increase  their  business  competitiveness  during  project \nimplementation. Under a pilot project, a credit line will be provided to \nenterprises  in  these  regions,  while  the  development  of  a  CIB,  a \nthe \nlegal/regulatory \nsubsequent  establishment  of  a  moveable  asset  registry,  and  the \nformation  of  BDSCs  and  a  CSF,  are  expected  to  improve  market \naccess  for  MSMEs  in  the  country  and  increase  the  engagement  of \nlocal financial institutions in supporting the MSME subsector over the \nlong run. The PPP component will assist in developing infrastructure \nand  services  through  private  investment,  thereby  reducing  the \nGovernment\u2019s  financial  burden  and  expanding  the  scope  of  private \nsector  participation  in  such  activities  in  the  future.  PPP-based \ninfrastructure  projects  will  facilitate  the  operation  of  MSMEs,  and \nenhance  the  quality  of  life  of  residents  of  the  targeted  regions.  The \n\ntransactions  and \n\nfor  secured \n\nframework \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nSafeguards \n\n \n\nin \n\nPPP component will assist the Government in enlarging the scope of \nPPP  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  future  PPP  projects \nacross  sectors  and  building  capacity  within  the  Government  to \nconceptualize PPP projects. The expansion of MSME operations and \nthe  development  of  PPP-based  infrastructure  are  expected  to \ngenerate  employment  opportunities \nthe  Maldives,  especially \namong the youth based in the atolls.  \n \nRisks  are  linked  to  political  factors,  interministerial  coordination, \ncapacity constraints, and factors related to PPPs. \n \nPolitical  risks  suggest  that  despite  technical  merits  of  the  reform \ninitiatives  supported  by  the  Project,  the  implementation  of  some \ninitiatives  will  require  strong  political  resolve.  However,  the  national \ndevelopment  focus  on  PSD  and  promotion  of  MSMEs,  particularly  in \nthe  remote  atolls  and  islands,  is  embedded  and  prioritized  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  and  strategy  documents,  including  the  7th  NDP \nand Vision 2020. In addition, the Government is strongly committed to \nplay  an  important  role  in  the  Project  including  MSME  development  in \nremote atolls.  \n \nThe  project  activities  involve  a  cross-section  of  the  MSME  subsector \nand  various  ministries.  Therefore,  close  coordination  is  required \namong  relevant  government  agencies  and  with  the  private  sector  to \nsupport  and  oversee  project  implementation.  To  mitigate  coordination \nrisks, the Project will ensure smooth implementation through the use of \nan  interministerial  project  steering  committee  and  a  dedicated  project \nmanagement unit working closely with private sector representatives.  \n \nVarious  departments  and  agencies  have  capacity  constraints.  Unless \ncapacity is enhanced, effective implementation of the Project will be at \nrisk. To mitigate this, the Project emphasizes developing the capacity \nof financial institutions, business associations, and government IAs to \nsupport successful project implementation.   \n \nFinally, the preparation and development of projects on a PPP basis is \na  complex  process  requiring  strong  government  commitment  and \nsupport as well as public acceptance. The selected projects will need \nto  be  financially  viable.  Project  selection  for  development  on  a  PPP \nbasis will be based on the Government\u2019s plans and strategies and be \nappropriately  packaged  so  that  they  provide  strong  value  for  money. \nThe Project is intended to help guide this process. \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nSector Description and Government Strategy \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Maldives,  a  small  island  economy,  comprises  20  atolls1 with  a  total  land  of  less \n2. \nthan  300  square  kilometers  (km2)  spread  over  900  km2.  The  country\u2019s  population  of \napproximately  321,000  live  on  202  of  the  1,190  islands.  Only  28  islands  have  a  land  area \ngreater  than  1  km2.  Only  5  islands  have  a  population  greater  than  5,000  and  70%  of  the \ninhabited  islands  have  a  population  of  less  than  1,000.  With  a  total  land  area  of  2  km2,  the \ncapital island of Mal\u00e9 is home to one third of the population. It is the seat of the Government \nand  the  center  of  commerce  and  business.  Concentration  of  the  population  in  the  capital  is \ngrowing, especially after the December 2004 tsunami that destroyed the means of livelihood \nin many islands. The small domestic market, high degree of openness to trade and investment \nflows,  and  heavy  dependence  on  tourism  and  fisheries  make  the  Maldives  highly  sensitive  to \nexternal developments and tourist arrivals. \n    \n\n1. \n\nThe Macroeconomic Context \n\nin \n\n \nThe Maldives has made impressive progress in its socioeconomic development. Sound \n3. \nmacroeconomic  management  combined  with  favorable  external  conditions,  and  strong \ndevelopment  assistance  support  led  to  an  average  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth of 7.9% over the past 15 years. The tourism sector is the engine of growth, accounting \nfor  33%  of  GDP,  28%  of  domestic  revenue,  and  over  90%  of  balance  of  payments  service \nreceipts.  Sustained  growth \ntourism  has  driven  economic  expansion  across  other \ncomplementary  sectors  in  the  economy  including  construction,  transport  and  communications, \nand  wholesale  and  retail  trade.  Notwithstanding,  prudent  fiscal  and  monetary  management, \nfiscal situation has significantly deteriorated since tsunami. The economy remains characterized \nby  (i)  limited  scope  for  sector  diversification  and  overall  dependency  on  tourism,  (ii)  limited \nresource  base  (fisheries),  and  (iii)  institutional  capacity  constraints.  A  summary  of  the  sector \nand subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nDespite sound macroeconomic management, income disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the \natolls  are  large  and  increasing.  The  gini  coefficient2 for  the  Maldives  for  1997  was  0.42  which \ncompares  favorably  in  the  rest  of  the  region.  During  1997\u20132004,  inequality  within  Mal\u00e9,  within \nthe  atolls,  and  within  all  domestic  regions  declined  marginally.  However,  inequality  between \nMal\u00e9  and  the  atolls  increased.  In  2005,  according  to  all  reasonable  poverty  lines,  poverty \nincidence was the highest in the northern and north central regions.3  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   A group of coral reef islands that surround a lagoon and are surrounded by open sea. \n2  The  gini  coefficient  is  a  measure  of  statistical  dispersion  most  prominently  used  to  measure  inequality  of  income \ndistribution  or  inequality  of  wealth  distribution.  No  other  decomposition  indexes  exist  for  tracking  aspects  of \ninequality. \n\n3  ADB. 2007. Maldives Country Partnership Strategy 2007\u20132011. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe Government, in an effort to ameliorate regional inequalities and reverse migration \n5. \nto  the  capital,  has  placed  regional  economic  growth  and  diversification  as  a  key  objective  of \neconomic development in both the 6th National Development Plan (NDP) for 2001\u20132005 and \nthe  current  7th  NDP  for  2006\u20132010.  As  part  of  the  7th  NDP,  the  Government  is  developing \nregional centers designed to have airports, ports, and other social and infrastructure facilities,4 \nsuch as health and education for the resident population. They will be complemented by focus \nislands  acting  as  atoll  service  hubs  and  growth  centers.  The  success  of  the  growth  centers \nalso  depends  on  the  connectivity  that  will  make  these  growth  centers  accessible  to  the  local \npopulation.  Unless  a  strong  network  of  connectivity  is  provided  between  these  growth  centers \nand  population  density  areas  within  these  atolls,  these  services  will  remain  unutilized  and  will \nnot  meet  the  objectives  for  which  they  have  been  planned  and  developed  owing  to \ndiseconomies  of  scale.5 These  efforts  will  reduce  regional  differentials  and  promote  inclusive \ngrowth and employment opportunities. \n \n\nNeed to Promote Private Sector Development \n\n2. \n \nThe Maldives has one of the most liberal trade, labor, and investment regimes in South \n6. \nAsia. However, the Government plays a large role in the economy, indirectly limiting the scope \nfor private sector participation. Government ownership, whether full or partial, is widespread in \nevery sector of the economy except tourism. In 2005, the country\u2019s 21 state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs) accounted for 36% of GDP, compared to 8% in member nations of the Organization for \nEconomic  Cooperation  and  Development.  SOEs  employ  one  third  of  the  workforce,  making \nthem the largest group of employers. In addition, civil service employment increased fivefold in \n20  years.  The  development  of  the  private  sector  has  thus  been  limited  given  the  lack  of  a \nsupportive policy environment.  \n \n7. \nChanging  the  Government\u2019s  role  from  a  direct  provider  of  services  to  a  facilitator  of \nprivate  initiatives  in  the  economy  is  one  of  the  key  requirements  for  improving  efficiency  and \neffecting  good  governance.  Recognizing  this,  the  Government  has  made  private  sector \ndevelopment (PSD) as one of the key pillars of the 7th National Development Plan (NDP) for \n2006\u20132010.  The  plan  encourages  strategies  that  are  market-based  and  actively  promote \ncompetition, innovation, and the development of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). To foster \ngreater private sector participation, the plan envisages the government and the private sector \nworking as partners to (i) provide opportunities for MSMEs to participate in a more competitive \nenvironment;  (ii)  to  maximize  the  potential  of  PPPs,  with  a  view  to  increasing  private \ninvestment;  (iii)  improve  corporate  governance  and  transparency;  and  (iv)  develop  linkages \nwith domestic and international private sectors to share expertise, resources, and technology.  \n \n8. \nApart  from  traditional  areas  such  as  manufacturing  and  trading,  the  private  sector  is \nbecoming  increasingly  important  in  areas  and  sectors  traditionally  considered  to  be  under  the \npublic  sector  domain.  This  will  include  the  development  of  infrastructure  as  in  the  planned \nregional centers to be complemented by focus islands acting as atoll growth centers. Given the \nfiscal  pressures  and  its  own  capacity,  the  Government  would  have  difficulty  in  developing  the \nrequired infrastructure facilities and providing services in an effective and efficient manner. The \nGovernment is also developing another 44 tourist resorts in addition to about 90 existing ones. \n\n                                                 \n4  Republic of the Maldives. 2007. The 7th National Development Plan. Mal\u00e8. \n5  Islands  that  are  of  importance  to  the  population  consolidation  program  are  likely  to  have  the  following \ncharacteristics: (i) sufficient land area to support a larger population; (ii) proximity to atoll capital; (iii) substantial \nexisting  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  potential  for  growth  because  of  land  area,  and  agricultural,  fishery,  or  other \ncommercial activity. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\nThe  new  resorts  will  require  additional  transport  linkages,  distribution  networks,  power,  water, \nand a host of other commodities and goods. \n \n9. \nIn  this  context,  the  private  sector  can  play  an  important  role  by  financing  critical \ninfrastructure needs and undertaking the basic services. The greater demand for these services \nfrom the increased number of resorts could lead to economies of scale for the supplier of those \nservices.  This  in  turn  would  lead  to  a  decrease  in  the  cost  of  services  for  the  resorts.  In \ncombination with greater supply of resort rooms, this could lead to some rationalization of tariffs \nfor  tourists  within  the  resorts,  thereby  increasing  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  in  the \ninternational  tourism  market.  The  greater  flow  of  tourists  will  feed  into  the  higher  demand  for \nservices and help foster the growth of private sector enterprises. Fortunately, the Maldives has \ngroups  that  can  initiate  and  sustain  private  sector  investments,  help  in  broad-based  private \ninvestment and initiatives under a PPP format with other regions, services and activities. Within \nthe  private  sector,  micro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  can  prosper  by \nproviding needed services, and supplying goods in the growth centers and hubs. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnabling Environment for Private Sector Participation  \n\n \n10.  Weak  Enabling  Environment.  Limited  private  sector  participation  in  the  Maldives  has \nbeen  primarily  due  to  the  lack  of  a  conducive  environment  for  private  sector  participation  and \ninadequate  public  sector  goods  to  support  private  investments.  The  key  enabling  factors  for \ngreater private sector participation include (i) clear government policy to promote PPP, shifting \nthe Government\u2019s role from a provider of services to a facilitator, consequently undertaking the \nprivatization  and  restructuring  of  SOEs;  (ii)  an  effective  legal  and  regulatory  environment;  (iii) \ngood  governance  and  transparency;  (iv)  capacity  development  [with  business  development \nservices  (BDS)];  (v)  easy  access  to  finance;  (vi)  introduction  of  PPP;  and  (vii)  availability  of \nproject finance for private sector projects or PPPs. All these enabling factors have been either \nmissing or are weak in the context of the Maldives.6 \n \nThe  recent  update  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  Report  (2007) 7  using  the \n11. \nindicators  of  starting  a  business  and  dealing  with  licenses,  ranks  the  Maldives  31st  and  8th \nrespectively  out  of  the  178  countries.  The  indicator  on  enforcing  contracts  (court  efficiency) \nranks the Maldives 41st, with shorter duration of enforcing contracts of 665 days and less cost \n(percentage  of  the  claim,  including  court  costs,  enforcement  costs,  and  attorney  fees)  16.5%, \nwhile neighboring countries such as India and Sri Lanka are 1,420 days and 1,318 days for the \nduration, and 39.6% and 22.8% for the cost ratio. With respect to legal enforcement of banks\u2019 \nrequired collateral, fixed mortgage enforcement is very effective. Unlike other countries in South \nAsia, enforcement of bank mortgages (houses and registered vessels) happens within one year. \nThis  is  mainly  due  to  the  Government\u2019s  parallel  efforts  to  improve  the  overall  legal  framework \nand  enabling  environment.  The  indicator  for  protecting  investors  and  corporate  governance \nranks the Maldives 62nd out of 178, similar to India and Sri Lanka. However, the indicator for \ngetting credit ranks the country 132nd, mainly because of strict collateral requirements, difficulty \nin  obtaining  credit  information,  and  lack  of  secured  financing  legal/regulatory  and  institutional \nframework covering moveables.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Land  reform  is  another  factor  that  will  support  private  sector  development  (PSD)  in  the  Maldives.  However,  the \nissues  involved  at  this  stage  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the  proposed  Project  (first  phase).  The  World  Bank  study \n(Sustaining  Growth  and  Improving  the  Investment  Climate)  and  ADB  TA  4745  on  SME  Development  provide  an \nassessment of the scope of reforms for private sector development.  \n\n7   World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2007. Doing Business in 2007. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n12.  Mitigating  these  Weak  Factors.  The  first  three  enabling  factors  of  paragraph  10  are \nbeing  currently  addressed  by  TA  interventions  of  several  development  agencies  including  the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the  World  Bank  (Appendix  3).  The \nGovernment is taking a broad range of actions to improve the legal and regulatory framework. \nMoreover,  UNDP  and  other  United  Nations  agencies  continue  to  help  the  Government \nharmonize  the  legal  framework  with  international  standards  and  increase  the  capacity  of  the \njustice system. With respect to the legal and regulatory environment, the enforcement of court \njudgments in the judicial system is improving due to the passage of regulations in 2006 enabling \nthe courts to seize bank accounts and hold the passports of those who fail to honor outstanding \nclaims.  Regarding  governance  and  transparency,  UNDP  and  other  United  Nations\u2019  agencies \npropose to provide assistance to the anticorruption board, public complaints bureau, and audit \noffice. The World Bank continues to manage a European Union-funded activity to develop and \nimplement  a  public  accounting  system,  as  well  as  Institutional  Development  Fund  grants  for \nstrengthening  procurement  capacity.  As  for  SOE  reform,  ADB  has  an  ongoing  project  to \nrestructure  and  privatize  SOEs.8 In  terms  of  business  regulation,  the  Maldives  has  strong  tax \nadministration  and  few  barriers  for  entry  of  new  businesses.9 Moreover,  ADB\u2019s  proposed  TA \nloan  for  strengthening  the  economic  and  financial  management  program  covers  governance \nand transparency issues.10  \n \n13. \nConsequently,  based  on  the  survey  findings  under  the  ADB  TA  (footnote  6)  and  in \ncoordination with other donors, the Project, as a first phase of support, intends to address the \nenabling factors for greater private sector participation identified under the remaining items (iv), \n(v),  and  (vi)  of  paragraph  10:  capacity  development  (including  the  provision  of  BDS),  easier \naccess to finance, and development of PPPs. The progress made and lessons identified during \nproject implementation under phase I of the country partnership strategy (CPS) (footnote 3) will \ndetermine the nature of support to address enabling factors available for project finance for the \nprivate  sector  as  well  as  improvement  of  the  enabling  environment  for  greater  private  sector \nparticipation during phase II.  \n \n\n4. \n\nMicro-, Small-, and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n\n \n14. \nClassification.  Current data maintained by the Government and the Maldives National \nChamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (MNCCI)  provide  limited  information  on  ownership, \nemployment,  turnover,  and  capital  investment  of  businesses.  About  2,500  businesses  are \nregistered  with  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade  (MEDT)  and  about  20%  of \nthese  reportedly  submitted  information  on  their  annual  turnover.  Lack  of  data  has  prevented \nbusinesses from being classified, but the 7th NDP calls for the introduction of online business \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2006.

The  TA  is  assisting  the  Government  in  areas  of  (i)  privatizing  and \nrestructuring  four  SOEs,  such  as  Maldives  Industrial  Fisheries  Company  Limited,  Maldives  National  Shipping \nCompany  Limited,  Public  Work  Services,  and  State  Electric  Company  Limited;  (ii)  designing  a  social  safety  net \nprogram  for  employees  displaced  as  a  result  of  implementing  SOE  reforms;  and  (iii)  developing  capacity  of  the \nexisting  Public  Enterprises  Commission  and  Public  Enterprises  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Board  as  the  nodal \nagencies for implementing SOE reform measures.  \n\n9  The Maldivian judicial system is based on a combination of Islamic Shariah law and common law in the commercial \nsector.

Maldives  Country  Partnership  Strategy  2007\u20132011.  Manila.  This  proposed  ADB  TA  loan  on \nStrengthening  the  Economic  and  Financial  Management  Program  (SEFMP)  is  to  enhance  the  capacity  of \ngovernment  agencies,  which  can  lead  to  better  portfolio  performance  across  aid-funded  projects  and  throughout \nvarious sectors. Also, SEFMP covers governance and transparency issues.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\nregistration  procedures  in  2008  to  facilitate  the  procedure,  broaden  the  coverage,  and  help \nclassify businesses.  \n \n15. \nDefinitions. The Maldives currently classifies MSMEs on the basis of a combination of \nemployees and turnover or sales. This system has the potential to lead to some confusion. To \novercome conflicting definitions and unreliable data on assets, the Maldives could simplify the \ndefinition  by  following  international  practice  of  using  only  the  number  of  employees  to  classify \nenterprises.  Recent  work  on  MSMEs  that  include  some  small  island  economies  provide  a \nstandard for classification,11 i.e., microenterprises have up to 4 employees, small enterprises, 5\u2013\n19 employees, and medium-sized enterprises, 20\u201350 employees. \n \n16.  MSME  Sectoral  Analysis  in  the  Atolls. In the atolls, fisheries and agriculture are the \nmost  important  activities  of  MSMEs  in  the  primary  sector.  Fisheries  sector  has  traditionally \ndominated  activity  with  the  processing  of  fish  that  take  the  form  of  dried,  salted,  and  smoked \ntuna fish products for local consumption and for export to Sri Lanka. Agriculture is the second \nmost  important  activity  and  has  a  large  potential  for  commercialization  in  Mal\u00e8  and  resort \nmarkets.  In  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sector,  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  maintenance  of \ncoastal  vessels  (mainly  for  fishing),  construction,  and  transportation  are  traditional  island \nactivities  of  MSMEs.  In  contrast,  handicrafts  and  tourism-related  services  have  been  given \nlimited attention, despite their potential. The main business activities in the atolls of the northern \nand  southern  regions  are  (i)  wholesale  and  retail  trade  and  other  services  (60%),  (ii)  fisheries \n(14%),  (iii)  manufacturing  including  fisheries  processing  (10%),  (iv)  agriculture  (9%),  and  (v) \nconstruction and others (7%).  \n \nIn  the  northern  and  southern  regions,  39%  started  their  businesses  during  the  last  5 \n17. \nyears  and  57%  of  the  businesses  started  during  the  last  10  years.  Only  14%  of  existing \nbusinesses  are  said  to  be  older  than  20  years.  Many  of  the  businesses  were  owner-operated \nwith  the  help  of  family  members.  More  than  90%  of  all  business  employed  less  than  5 \nemployees  and  the  average  number  of  workers  employed  is  less  than  2  employees.  The \nbusinesses  interviewed  were  asked  to  state  the  value  of  their  business  assets.  In  the  atolls, \nmost  of  the  businesses  do  not  maintain  records  of  their  assets.  The  estimated  asset  value  of \n25% of these businesses are less than Rf50,000 (around $3,900), assets of another 25% were \nbetween  Rf50,000  and  Rf100,000  (around  $7,800),  and  40%  estimated  their  assets  at  more \nthan  Rf100,000.  Only  5%  indicated  that  their  assets  were  more  than  Rf1  million  (around \n$78,000). For more details, please see Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\n1. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n \nThe Government is aware of the significance of strengthening the MSME subsector as a \n18. \nstep  towards  promoting  overall  inclusive  growth.  However,  despite  Government  efforts,  the \nMSME  subsector  continues  to  be  weak,  it  has  not  generated  much-needed  employment \nopportunities to serve as the engine of growth as planned. Based on the findings of ADB TA on \nMSME development,12 the issues and opportunities for the sector are as follows. \n \n                                                 \n11  Small and Medium Size Enterprises in Countries in Transition. 2006. Entrepreneurship and SMEs Series. Geneva. \nFor  a  survey  of  MSME  definitions  used  in  transition  economies,  see  United  National  Economic  Commission  for \nEurope.   \n\n12 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Small and Medium Enterprise Development. \n\nManila (TA 4745-MLD). The TA includes an MSME market survey. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThe  ADB  TA  on  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  development  (footnote  6)  conducted  a \n19. \nsurvey of 228 businesses in the northern, southern, and south central regions. Major constraints \nidentified  include  limited  access  and  high  cost  of  financing,  limited  market  access,  lack  of \ntechnically skilled labor, and high cost of transportation and power. The relative significance and \nseverity  of  other  constraints  affecting  enterprise  performance  are  highly  diversified  across \nsectors.  Access  to  and  cost  of  finance  nevertheless  emerged  as  the  major  obstacle  to  doing \nbusinesses in major sectors. \n \n\na. \n\nLimited Access to Financial Services \n\n \n20. \nLimited  Access  to  Finance.  Only  one  third  of  MSMEs  use  bank  loans  for  their \nactivities. Instead, firms rely on internal funds for working capital. Bank of Maldives (BML), the \nlargest  and  a  national  commercial  bank,  contributes  11%  to  existing  working  capital  needs  of \nMSMEs while 3% come from other international commercial bank branches.13 Nearly 60% of the \ncredit  extended  is  for  tourism,  followed  by  export\u2013import  related  services  covering  commerce \nand fisheries. Together, these three sectors absorb more than 85% of existing loans.  \n \n21. \nLack of Credit Information on MSMEs and Secured Financing. As mentioned earlier, \nthe Maldives ranks 132nd worldwide on the comparative ease of getting credit, below most other \nSouth Asian countries. The poor ranking is largely due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable credit \ninformation  on  credit  borrowers  especially  MSMEs  due  to  the  absence  of  a  public  or  private \ncredit information database and a central information agency to facilitate the exchange of credit \ninformation among lenders. Consequently, the provision of financial services is restricted to low-\nrisk clients or based on excessive collateral requirements instead of a credit analysis relying on \nfinancial statements and business plans. Therefore, development of a credit information system \nto  improve  the  accuracy  and  cost-effectiveness  of  credit  risk  decisions  by  financial  institutions \nwould result in improved access to finance. Moreover, in the current lending environment, there \nis  no  scope  to  borrow  against  moveables  (e.g.,  receivables,  inventories,  chattels  on \nmachineries, motor vehicles, etc.) due to the lack of an enabling law and regulatory framework \nto  allow  such  lendings  and  a  central  registry  for  verifying  the  existence  and  status  of  such \ncollaterals. Given that MSMEs usually have significant moveable assets, enabling borrowers to \nuse these moveable assets and rights to secure their indebtedness open up new possibilities for \nMSMEs to access finance and make more efficient use of their assets.  \n \n22. \nCollateral-based Lending. General banking practices limit loan amounts for businesses \nin  the  atolls  to  50%  of  the  assessed  value  of  houses  and  registered  vessels.  This  provides  a \ngood  opportunity  to  introduce  a  new  financing  culture  that  can  overcome  existing  lending \nrestrictions  to  enhance  working  capital  and  term  finance  and  encourage  investment  without \nunduly increasing commercial lending risks. The plan to set up a pilot line of credit facility (LCF) \nis expected to engender more loans being sanctioned for MSME risks. The LCF is expected to \nenable  BML  to  familiarize  itself  with  MSMEs  and  to  be  able  to  offer  loans  with  less  restrictive \ncollateral  requirements  than  conventional  arrangements.  The  improved  understanding  of \ndealing with MSME risks, based on cash flow and financial and operating performance and the \nintegrity  of  the  borrower,  should  lead  to  improved  recovery  rates  of  loans  granted  under  the \nplanned  LCF,  which  is  in  turn  expected  to  lead  to  a  reduction  in  the  risk  averseness  of  the \nfinancial institutions toward noncollateral cash-based lending. \n \n\n                                                 \n13 BML is jointly owned by the Government (51%), island communities (25%), and other government agencies (24%). \n\nBML has 19 branches, including 5 mobile branches. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\nUnderdeveloped  Banking  Subsector.  The  financial  sector  is  limited  in  size  with  one \n23. \nlocally owned bank (BML), branches of three South Asian commercial banks, and a Hongkong \nand  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  (HSBC)  international  bank  branch.  All  these  banks  follow \ninternational  banking  practices.  Banking  is  regulated  by  the  Maldives  Monetary  Authority \n(MMA), which acts as the central bank. Banks seldom extend loans with maturities of more than \n3\u20135 years and the spreads remain high. Under the Project, the suggested subloans are to have \nlonger maturity periods, more than 3 years, and a spread based on prevailing market rates of \n4%\u20135%.14 These  will  be  reviewed  by  ADB  TA  consultants  during  the  initial  stage  of  project \nimplementation  to  determine  if  the  spreads  are  commensurate  to  the  risk  in  a  setting  where \nthere is limited market competition. \n\n \nb. \n\nBusiness Support Infrastructure \n\n \n24. \nLack  of  Market  Information  and  Technical  Expertise.  Other  key  impediments  to \nMSME growth are the lack of market information and limited technical expertise. Most MSMEs \nare  still  in  their  early  stage  of  development,  selling  their  products  locally  or,  at  best,  to  the \nmarket in Mal\u00e9. MSMEs have difficulty obtaining relevant business information on markets and \ntechnologies, and employing external services to enhance their business performance.  \n \n25. \nLimited  Role  of  Business  Member  Organizations  and  Need  for  Capacity  Building \nwithin  the  Government.  Business  member  organizations,  such  as  the  Maldives  National \nChamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI) and Women Entrepreneurs Council (WEC), are \npresent in Mal\u00e9. However, their range of activities and services are limited. On the other hand, \nthe  Enterprise  Development  Unit  (EDU)  under  MEDT,  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to create a competitive private sector, currently operates with seven newly \nrecruited staff who need training in facilitating market development and promoting MSMEs. \n \n\nc. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation through Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n\n \n26. \nInfrastructure Deficiency. High utility prices in remote atolls reflect lack of infrastructure \nfor  transportation  and  power.  Cargo  transportation  relies  on  traditional  cargo  and  passenger \nvessels  operating  on  an  unscheduled  basis.  Passenger  transport  relies  on  the  same  vessels \nand  the  use  of  air  transport  services.  This  has  led  to  the  high  cost  of  doing  business  in  the \natolls. The real issue is fragmentation of demand and consequent higher costs to the economy \nas a whole as the services were created individually leading to higher per unit costs and lower \ncapacity  utilization.  Therefore,  the  Government  has  an  opportunity  to  undertake  the  role  of \nregulating  some  of  these  sectors  to  meet  conventional  objectives  and  to  structure  projects  to \nallow the private sector to consolidate demand and achieve its financial and commercial targets. \n \n27. \nEnabling Environment for PPP. Consequently, the Government intends to promote the \ndevelopment of infrastructure, particularly for remedying the current regional imbalance and low \nlevel of competitiveness of domestic MSMEs. The development, execution, and management of \nPPP projects, however, is a complex process, requiring detailed upfront planning throughout the \nlife  of  a  project  and  anticipating  risks  and  issues  that  are  likely  to  impact  project  success. \nTherefore, the existing legal, institutional, and regulatory environment needs to be reviewed to \nidentify  areas  that  could  be  improved  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \nparticipation  before  the  selected  PPP  projects  are  offered  under  the  pilot.  The  enabling \nenvironment  may  differ  from  sector  to  sector  and  would  provide  policy  stability  and  credibility \n\n                                                 \n14 According to BML, spread on the LCF could be reduced due to the partial government guarantee. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nthat  would  go  a  long  way  to  attracting  private  investments  in  infrastructure  sectors in  the  long \nterm. \n \n28. \nCapacity  Development. Along with streamlining and creating an enabling environment \nfor  private  investors,  appropriate  capacity  development  must  be  carried  out  within  the  key \ngovernment  ministries  that  would  be  developing  and  handling  such  projects.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  would  involve  (i)  institutionalization,  within  the  government,  of  PPP  procurement \nprocess  and  skills  development,  and  development  of  an  effective  sector  strategy  and  project \nidentification  and  prioritization  process;  (ii)  improved  preparation  of  projects  to  meet  more \ndemanding  requirements  of  investors;  and  (iii)  widespread  understanding,  through  education \nand application, of the different private sector participation options that could be effective.15 \n    \n\n2. \n\nStrategy and Lessons \n\n \n29. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Development  Strategy  and  ADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership \nStrategy.  PSD  is  a  key  pillar  of  the  7th  NDP  (2006\u20132010).  As  earlier  stated,  the  plan \nencourages  market-based  strategies  and  actively  promotes  competition,  innovation,  and \nresilient  PPPs  (Appendix  4).  ADB\u2019s  CPS  2007\u20132011  for  the  Maldives  is  fully  aligned  with  the \ngoals and objectives of the 7th NDP and those of the development partners to promote PSD for \nbroad-based  economic  growth.  ADB  assistance  is  to  be  provided  following  a  sequential \napproach to enhance a holistic set of capacity building for PSD that includes (i) improving the \nenabling  environment  for  MSMEs,  (ii)  enhancing  access  to  finance  and  easing  financial \nconstraints, and (iii) introducing PPP in identified areas such as transport and power. The CPS \nidentifies  key  indicators  including  business  model  development  linked  to  the  markets,  with \nenhanced  access  to  financing  and  improved  PPP  development.  Once  readiness  is  secured, \nADB\u2019s  targeted  second  phase  of  assistance  would  include  support  for  investment  projects  to \nleverage institutional strengthening measures already in place.  \n \nFindings  of  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department.  The  project  design  uses \n30. \nimportant  recommendations  in  the  validation  report  of  the  country  strategy  and  program \ncompletion  report 16 prepared  by  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department.  The  dearth  of  a \ncritical  mass  of  suitably  trained  staff  has  undermined  institutional  development  and  business \ndevelopment  activities  in  the  Maldives.  Under  its  analysis,  the  report  identifies  the  following \nweaknesses  (i)  lack  of  adequate  human  resources,  (ii)  institutional  deficit,  and  (iii)  low \nabsorptive  capacity  for  external  assistance.  Moreover,  the  recent  evaluation  study  of  the \nOperations Evaluation Department on PSD operations emphasizes the importance of PPPs in \ndeveloping the private sector. ADB will help build the Government\u2019s capacity to facilitate MSME \ndevelopment  and  PPPs  under  phase  I  of  the  CPS,  which  is  to  fill  the  skills  gap  between  the \nprivate sector in the Maldives and other comparable middle-income developing countries.    \n \nLessons  from  PSD  Operations.  The  project design  considers  lessons  from  ADB  and \n31. \nother  development  partners\u2019  projects  in  the  Maldives.  Key  lessons  are  (i)  implementation \ncapacity constraints hamper funding agencies\u2019 ability to contribute to development  results in a \ntimely  manner  and  could  be  used  far  more  effectively  if  institutional  capacity  constraints  were \nholistically addressed and enhanced; (ii) PSD operations must be closely coordinated with other \nexternal  funding  agencies  especially  where  effective  partnerships  and  synergies  can  be \n\n                                                 \n15 For more details, please refer to paragraphs 54-58. \n16 ADB. 2007.

With respect to business development and access to financing issues, an assessment of \nthe  projects19 implemented  by  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  and  UNDP \nreveal  the  following  lessons  (i)  keeping  the  credit  and  noncredit  activities  under  the  same \numbrella of the development banking cell of BML led to neglect of noncredit activities, therefore \nthe  strategy  under  the  Project  is  to  keep  noncredit  activities  under  the  separate  umbrella  of \nbusiness development services centers (BDSC) operations; (ii) about one third of the borrowers \nutilized the loan for consumption expenditure and immediate liquidity needs instead of investing \nit  in  income-generating  activities  because  of  the  sole  focus  of  BML  credit  officers  on  loan \nrecovery  and  not  on  monitoring  the  activities  of  borrowers;  the  Project  strategy  is  therefore  to \nkeep the monitoring and guidance provision under the purview of BDSC operations; (iii) BML did \nnot  adequately  focus  on  implementing  training  and  advisory  assistance  for  the  target  groups \nand did not use the risk fund established for such activities. Instead, the development banking \ncell reserved the fund to cover any non-repayment of loans by beneficiaries; the Project strategy \nis  therefore  to  provide  for  a  CSF  to  support  training  and  advisory  activities  under  the  BDSC \noperations with stricter approval mechanisms; (iv) the loan recovery rate was very high at 98% \nowing  to  incentives  built  into  the  lending  mechanism,  i.e.,  a  facility  providing  higher  loan \napprovals for borrowers who repaid the loan on schedule; the Project strategy is to have a credit \ninformation  bureau  (CIB)  providing  credit  ratings  for  borrowers  in  the  medium  term  for  easy \naccess to finance; and (v) poor households were not effectively targeted under previous projects \nand have not been able to access finance due to lack of effective training; the Project strategy is \ntherefore to use the BDSC operations to undertake such training and mobilization. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\n \n33. \nSeveral  externally  assisted  activities  relate  to  the  creation  of  an  improved  environment \nfor business development. The Government has embarked on a new strategy of engaging with \nits development partners to focus on providing assistance in certain sectors or thematic areas to \nreduce  duplication  and  overlap,  and  to  minimize  aid  transaction  costs.  ADB  will  focus  on \ncapacity  building  in  public  sector  management  as  well  as  support  for  transport,  power,  and \nMSMEs. The World Bank will remain engaged in governance, tertiary education, fisheries, and \nenvironmental  management.  The  United  Nations  will  remain  involved  in  governance  and \ndisaster management. ADB\u2019s total lending assistance to the Maldives between 1995 and 2006, \non an approval basis, totaled $57.6 million for nine projects.20  \n\n                                                 \n17 A project needs to develop close linkages with other projects to avoid costly overlapping and to be sustainable. \n18 Successful transition to middle income country status requires changing the role of government from a provider of \nbasic services to a regulatory setting role, establishing equal opportunities for the private sector, and establishing a \nframework for formulating and implementing policies including attracting more foreign investments. \n\n19 The  Atolls  Credit  and  Development  Banking  Project  and  Southern  Atolls  Development  Project  funded  by  the \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  as  well  as  the  Atoll  Development  Project  for  Sustainable \nLivelihoods project funded by UNDP. \n\n20 Two  loans  for  a  total  of  $15.0  million  were  provided  to  the  energy  sector,  two  loans  for  $12.3  million  to  the \neducation  sector,  one  loan  for  $9.5  million  to  the  communications  sector,  and  two  loans  for  $14.0  million  for \nregional outer islands development. Besides the planned assistance, ADB provided a grant of $20.0 million and a \nloan of $1.8 million for emergency post-tsunami assistance in early 2005. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nFive  United  Nations  organizations  maintain  offices  in  the  Maldives. 21  World  Bank \n34. \ninvolvement  has  been  somewhat  limited.  Since  1979,  it  has  financed  and  completed  eight \nprojects  with  total  loans  amounting  to  approximately  $66.2  million.22 Currently,  it  is  funding  a \nproject on mobile phone banking aiming to provide an automated banking and payment system \nthrough mobile phones, leading to reduced transaction cost. Details of external assistance to the \nsector are given in Appendix 3. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n35. \nThe  intended  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  developed  and  expanded  private  MSME \nsubsector  leading  to  accelerated  inclusive  growth  for  broadbased  and  sustainable  local \neconomic development in the northern and southern domestic regions and targeted sectors in \nthe  Maldives.  It  is  also aimed  at  providing  the necessary  support  infrastructure  to improve  the \ncompetitiveness  of  domestic  MSMEs  and  redress  the  current  regional  imbalance  through  the \npromotion of PPPs. \n \n36. \nThe outcomes of the Project will include (i) enhanced access to finance by providing an \nLCF to pilot credit assistance to MSMEs in designated regions, capacity development of BML, \nestablishment of a CIB, and introduction of a legal/regulatory framework and a central moveable \nassets  registry  for  secured  financing;  (ii)  improved  access  to  markets,  technology  and \ninformation, and strengthened capacity development by creating BDSC operations and a CSF \nto  ensure  provision  of  the  necessary  TA  and  knowledge  transfer  for  growth-oriented  MSME \nbusinesses;  and  (iii)  institutionalization  of  PPP  as  a  means  for  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation in the development of critical infrastructure necessary for MSME and overall PSD. \n \nB. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nComponent A: MSME Promotion  \n\n1. \n \n37. \nThe  component  will  focus  on  establishing  BDSC  operations  and  a  CSF  to  facilitate \ndemand-oriented  private  sector  BDS  and  assist  the  MSMEs,  both  existing  and  start-ups,  and \ndevelop the capacity of related stakeholders. To effectively support development of the MSME \nsector,  the  Government  needs  to  pursue  a  well-coordinated  approach  in  consultation  with \nprivate  sector  stakeholders.  Since  the  availability  of  capacity  development  training institutes  is \nconstrained, the Government will need to expand the responsibilities of EDU to bring together \ndifferent  types  of  PSD  including  MSME  development  under  a  strengthened  institutional \nframework. \n \n\na. \n\nBDSC Operation \n\n \n38. \nThe  BDSC  operations  will  be  the  principal  vehicle  for  the  delivery  of  BDS  products  to \nMSMEs  for  facilitating  cluster  development  in  targeted  regions.  There  is  currently  no  BDS \n\n                                                 \n21 Namely, United Nations Children's Fund, UNDP, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Volunteers, and \nWorld  Health  Organization.  Their  activities  are  coordinated  under  the  United  Nations  development  framework. \nUNDP\u2019s  work  concentrates  on  governance,  poverty  reduction,  and  environment  as  well  as  MSME  support. \nCurrently, a project is under way on public service reforms aiming at capacity development in the public sector. \n22 Four educational projects contributed to human resource development; upgrading of the airport in Mal\u00e9 supported the \ngrowth  of  tourism.  Three  projects  helped  modernize  the  fishing  fleet  and  strengthen  public  sector  capacity  in \ncollecting, processing, and exporting fish. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\nprovider in the Maldives. Owing to the easier availability of resources in Mal\u00e9 as well as the fact \nthat most MSME entrepreneurs do visit Mal\u00e9 for various reasons, a central BDSC will be set up \nin  Mal\u00e9  within  EDU.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the  EDU  will  be  the  overall \ncoordinating  body  for  the  BDSCs.  The  project  coordinator  of  the  PMU  will  be  recruited  on  an \ninternational contract (for 24 person-months). The project coordinator will be supported by one \nnational  MSME  portal  and  communication  specialist,  and  one  national  monitoring  and \nevaluation specialist. \n \nThe  central  BDSC  will  provide  services  in  the  targeted  regions  through  two  operation \n39. \ndesks  to  be  housed  in  the  existing  regional  development  management  office  premises  at \nHithadhoo (southern region) and Kulhudhuffushi (northern region). The operation desks will be \nstaffed  by  general  administrative  staff  drawn  from  existing  staff  of  the  regional  development \nmanagement  office.  The  specialized  staff  and  resources  will  travel  to  the  local  BDSCs  on  a \nneeds basis to provide specialized services and training. This will help avoid idle resources and \noptimize  utilization  of  BDSC  resources.  One  national  consultant  will  be  based  in  each  of  the \nBDSC  operation  desks.  Initially,  the  TA  will  be  provided  to  the  BDSC  operations  to  support \ndevelopment of a business plan indicating core activities and required investment, identification \nof revenue streams, and recruitment of staff and their capacity building.  \n \n\nCost-Sharing Facility Operation \n\nb. \n \n\n40. \nCoverage.  A  $1.0  million  CSF  is  proposed  to  conduct  capacity  development  in  a  wide \nrange  of  services  to  about  200\u2013300  MSMEs  for  local  economic  development  in  the  targeted \nregions  and  sectors.23 The  range  of  services  will  include  (i)  consulting  services  for  business \nplanning and business counseling, identification and provision of information, and coaching; (ii) \ntraining services on costing and pricing, marketing and sales, accounting and entrepreneurship; \n(iii)  facilitation  services  for  market  access,  access  to  finance,  and  formation  of  business \ncooperatives;  and  (iv)  government-related  services  covering  support  for  business  registration \nand  licensing,  linking  to  the  government  database  and  extension  services.  The  Project  will \nsupport development of service products that could be marketed to provide a revenue stream to \nmake  the  unit  self-sustaining  in  the  future  beyond  the  CSF  time  frame.  The  ratios  for  cost-\nsharing among the CSF and beneficiaries as well as detailed administrative procedures will be \nfinalized by the project management unit and CSF management unit.24 ADB reserves the right \nto perform random audit of the CSF management unit to ensure adequate and efficient use of \nfunds. \n \nCSF  Management.  The BDSC will act as the CSF management unit with the provision \n41. \nof a subcommittee for initial screening and provision of recommendations to the project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  for  its  final  approval  of  the  cost-sharing  mechanism.  The  BDSC  will  be \naccountable  to  the  PSC.  The  project  coordinator,  an  international  consultant,  will  chair  the \nsubcommittee,  which  will  comprise  one  representative  to  be  nominated  from  each  of  EDU, \nMNCCI, and WEC. The decisions of the subcommittee will be by a majority vote. \n \n42.  Monitoring  and  Supervision.  Each  BDSC  operation  desk  will  submit  an  annual \nprogress report to the project coordinator on the supported enterprises. The cost of monitoring \nand evaluation field visits will be covered by fees charged by the central BDSC with any deficits \n                                                 \n23 This  coverage  was  calculated  from  population  figures  in  the  vicinity  (over  30,000  inhabitants)  and  the  estimated \n\nnumber of microenterprises in the target atolls. \n\n24 ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  Preparing  the  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprise  Development  Project,  Manila  (TA  4745-MLD).  These  administrative  procedures,  etc.  will  be  finalized \nbased on the recommendations of this TA.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ncovered by the CSF upon prior approval of the CSF management unit. An overall evaluation of \nthe CSF will take place at the middle and end of project implementation. Details of the CSF are \ngiven in Appendix 5. \n \n\nc. \n \n\nCapacity Development of EDU, MNCCI, and WEC \n\n43. \nEDU  is  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  create  effective  and \ncompetitive PSD. Established in 2004, EDU currently operates with newly recruited staff in need \nof  experience  relating  to  MSME  promotion.  Capacity  development  support  will  be  provided  to \nEDU  through  the  project  coordinator,  a  communications  specialist,  and  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation  specialist  for  the  duration  of  the  project.  Training  programs  will  be  conducted  for \nregular  EDU  staff  in  project  coordination,  marketing,  financing,  and  communication  skills.  The \nProject will support EDU in the design and implementation of a media campaign, development \nand registry of a web portal for EDU, policy development through competitive studies of various \nproducts  and  services  to  prioritize  specific  industries  and  sectors,  and  strategic  support  for \nrelevant cluster and supply chain analyses in targeted regions.    \n \n44.  MNCCI  and  WEC  will  be  involved  in  supporting  BDSC  operation  by  providing  linkages \nwith available markets and providing consulting services. MNCCI and WEC will be represented \non  the  CSF  subcommittee  so  that  they  are  involved  in  the  decision-making  process  for \nsupporting entrepreneurship. MNCCI has about 460 members, of which 60%\u201380% are MSMEs. \nIt  provides  a  range  of  services  in advocacy,  lobbying,  government  liaison,  and  organization  of \ntrade fairs. Its effectiveness is undermined by the lack of regional chapters in the atolls, a lack of \nstrategy and plan of activities, and the absence of any BDS products for its members. MNCCI \nrecently  attempted  a  business  link  project  through  MEDT  to  provide  BDS  to  the  MSMEs.  The \nefforts  of  MNCCI  are  constrained  by  lack  of  clear-cut  strategy,  lack  of  professional  staff,  and \nlack of funding for staff training. To address these constraints, the Project will support MNCCI in \ndeveloping  its  strategic  planning  process  including  elaboration  of  plans  for  operations,  human \nresource development, and training for recruited professional staff.  \n \n45.  WEC  currently  does  not  have  a  secretariat  and  shares  MNCCI  facilities.  It  has  been \ninvolved  in  the  \u2018WEC  for  Women  Empowerment  Program\u2019  supported  by  the  United  Nations \nPopulation  Fund  and  the  gender  ministry.  This  program  entails  training  women  to  produce \nhandicrafts. WEC sources the produce from the women, undertakes quality control, and certifies \nand  markets  the  products.  WEC  has  been  undertaking  a  program  in  association  with  UNDP \nwhereby UNDP is providing handicraft training and WEC is providing training to those women in \nentrepreneurial skills. WEC needs a secretariat with suitably qualified staff to undertake quality \ncontrol,  inventory  management,  marketing,  and  website  maintenance. The  Project  will  support \nWEC\u2019s  capacity  development  to  undertake  such  activities  efficiently  and  provide  extension \nservices to the BDSC operations. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Enhancing Access to Finance  \n\n \n46. \nBanking practice in the Maldives limits loan amounts for businesses in the atolls to 50% \nof the assessed value of houses and registered vessels. Commercial banks do not accept other \nmoveable assets due to monitoring difficulties. A facility is needed to enhance access to finance \nfor MSMEs without unduly increasing commercial lending risks. To help overcome the financing \nconstraints, the Project will provide a credit line for providing finance to the MSMEs and develop \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\nsupporting  credit  infrastructure  to  facilitate  credit  decision-making  and  making  collateral \nrequirements less restrictive.25 These are essential to improve market-based finance to MSMEs. \n\n \na. \n\nSubcomponent 1: LCF Operation and Capacity Development  \n\nthe  greatest  bottleneck \n\nfunds,  has  emerged  as \n\n \n47. \nBML is the main financial institution in the Maldives lending to MSMEs, and this lending \nhas  been  limited  and  has  very  high  collateral  requirements.  The  Government  is  keenly \ninterested  in  promoting  the  MSME  subsector  but  access  to  finance,  especially  for  medium-  to \nfor  MSME  development. \nlong-term \nConsequently,  the  Government  through  MEDT  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury \n(MOFT) decided to embark on this initiative involving BML as the implementing agency (IA) for \nthe LCF to pilot expanded credit assistance to MSMEs under a partial government guarantee to \nprovide BML an avenue to better understand MSME risks, strengthen its ability to mitigate risks, \nand  appreciate  the  revenues  and  benefits  of  engaging  in  the  development  of  the  MSME \nsubsector. The aim is to have BML subsequently pioneer support for the subsector owing to an \nimproved understanding and familiarity from this pilot operation. Credit enhancement operations \nfor  the  MSME  subsector  have  proven  effective  in  a  number  of  schemes  and  countries.  Other \ncomponents revolve around this component as the CSF and CIB will be useful only if MSMEs \nhave enhanced access to finance.  \n \nCredit  Line  for  MSME  Lending.  An  LCF  is  envisaged  under  the  Project  to  pilot \n48. \ninitiative 26  in  promoting  a  culture  of  lending  to  MSMEs  with  less  restrictive  collateral \nrequirements and cash-flow-based financing. The aim of the LCF will be to build the capacity of \nBML  in  undertaking  development-oriented  financing.  The  Republic  of  the  Maldives  will  borrow \nfrom ADB and bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan. MOFT will enter into a subsidiary loan \nagreement  with  BML,  and  the  LCF  will  be  provided  to  BML.  BML  has  experience  with \ndevelopment banking and an adequate number of professional staff to administer the LCF. The \nproposed LCF fund size will be $3.0 million during the pilot phase. Applications for subloans will \nbe  prepared  at  the  BDSCs  based  on  the  business  plans  submitted  by  the  MSMEs  and \nforwarded  by  the  BDSC  to  BML  for  credit  risk  assessment.  The  BDSC  will  provide  credit  risk \ninformation related to the applicant for BML\u2019s consideration. BML will undertake an independent \ncredit risk assessment of the proposals to determine whether they meet lending criteria agreed \nto by BML, the Government, and ADB. Upon completion of scrutiny, BML will decide whether to \napprove the subloan. Onlending agreements will be signed between BML and the subborrower. \nThe terms of such agreements will be on a commercial basis at the prevailing market rates of \ninterest and tenor. BML will execute an onlending agreement with the subborrower, and submit \na report on  approved subloans and a copy of onlending agreements to MOFT. The maximum \nsubloan  size  for  applicants  will  be  $80,000  (or  Rf1,024,000)  and  the  anticipated  average \nsubloan size is $40,000. It is expected that BML will provide around 70 MSMEs with subloans \nunder LCF.27 Any deviation will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval.  \n \n49. \nEDU, in cooperation with MNCCI, WEC, the BDSCs and BML, will act as the facilitator \nfor marketing and popularizing the facility. This is necessary, in the context of the Maldives, as \ncapacity  must  be  developed  within  an  institution  to  introduce  credit  guarantee  products.  The \n\n                                                 \n25 According to the conventional arrangements in Maldives, the borrowers are requested to provide collaterals up to \n200% of the assessed value of houses and registered vessels. Under the LCF, the collateral requirement  will be \nless restrictive and the collateral ratio will be reduced down to 100% (or less) of the assessed value.  \n\n26  Upon successful implementation of pilot initiatives, building on this component, a separate non-sovereign loan to \n\nBML could be considered for enhancing the access to finance for MSME throughout the country. \n\n27 Based  on  the  survey  under  ADB  TA  4745  on  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  (2007),  ADB  identified \nadequate size for subloans. Please see Supplementary B (MSME Survey of Summary of three Regions) for details. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nBDSCs\u2019 involvement in appraising the loan assistance proposals under the LCF is expected to \nact as counter-check for any moral hazard. To provide BML with an incentive for onlending to \nMSMEs  in  designated  atolls  with  less  restrictive  collateral  arrangement,  which  is  the  core \npurpose in line with the purpose of loan under the LCF, the Government will provide BML with \nan  80%  guarantee  for  defaulting  subloans.  BML  will  bear  the  remaining  risk  to  ensure  BML \ncontinues to be diligent in its lending activities. Details of the LCF are in Appendix 6. \n \n50. \nInstitutional  Strengthening  and  Capacity  Development  Support  to  BML.  The \nproposed  LCF  will  leverage  on  the  strong  branch  network  and  wide  geographic  presence  of \nBML  and  support  BML  in  its  efforts  to  extend  its  business  outreach  to  MSMEs  located  in  the \ntargeted regions. As accreditation of lending based on agreed eligibility criteria will be delegated \nto BML, the financial aspects of BML\u2019s performance have been reviewed.28 Details of the BML \ndue  diligence  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  To  enable  BML  to  fully  exploit  its \npotential  and  effectively  intermediate  financing,  BML  must  strengthen  its  existing  structure, \noperations,  and  capacity  for  MSME  lending.  Capacity  development  will  be  provided  to  cover \nBML\u2019s  human  resource  strategy  and  training,  performance  targets,  and  enhancement  of \nefficiency  to  reach  out  to  target  clients  in  designated  regions.  Adequate  risk  assessment  and \neasy loan procedures are as important for MSMEs as low interest rates. Therefore, during the \npreparatory  period  for  loan  implementation,  the  introduction  of  appropriate  MSME  lending \nproducts  and  techniques,  risk  assessment,  loan  operating  procedures,  and  strengthening  of \ninstitutional  capacity  of  BML  will  be  essential.29 The  Project  will  review  the  legal  aspects  of \nenforcing debt recoveries and contract enforcement in the event of defaults on subloans.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSubcomponent 2: CIB and CMAR \n\n \n51. \nThis  subcomponent  will  support  the  establishment  and  implementation  of  a  CIB.  The \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  recently  provided  support  to  MMA  to  develop  a  feasibility \nstudy, including identification and drafting of the necessary regulatory framework, costing, and \npreparation  of  technical  specifications  for  appropriate  hardware  and  software.  The  study \nconcludes that market support will be positive and information asymmetry in the market must be \nreduced. ADB and International Finance Corporation are currently assisting MMA in preparing a \nrequest for proposal for a turnkey consultancy package for establishment and implementation of \nthe  CIB. 30  The  CIB  will  develop  a  database  for  MSMEs  to  support  financing  by  financial \ninstitutions for the subsector.   \n \n52. \nThis  subcomponent  will  also  support  the  MMA  in  laying  the  foundations  for  secured \ntransactions,  the  drafting  of  the  underlying  legal/regulatory  framework  and  subsequent  \n\n                                                 \n28 The development banking cell in BML has extended need-based credit to island populations. These have helped \nthem to attain income security, own productive assets, and develop their entrepreneurship skills. BML, through its \ndevelopment  banking  activities,  was  the  implementing  agency  of  the  Atolls  Credit  and  Development  Banking \nProject, which covers the northern and central atolls, and the Southern Atolls Development Project, which covers \nthe  four  southern  atolls.  Both  projects  were  financed  by  long-term  borrowing  from  the  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural Development. \n\n29  For  this  purpose,  the  ongoing  ADB  TA-4745  MLD  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  BML  to  ensure  that  it \nefficiently  intermediates  financing  and  fully  utilizes  the  funds  through  establishment  of  adequate  financing \nmechanisms. \n\n30 The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), established under the MMA Act of 1981, has been empowered by section \n4,  subsection  (c)  to  supervise  and  regulate  banking  so  as  to  promote  a  sound  financial  system.  Best  practice \nprinciples  regarding  use  of  credit  information  have  been  introduced  in  the  Banking  Act  and  MMA  Act.  As  such, \nthere are no major legal barriers to information sharing under the Project. Moreover, in order to expand the scope \nof use of credit information from banking sector to nonbanking sector, the Government is reinforcing the necessary \nlegal framework.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\nintroduction of a central moveable assets registry (CMAR) in the medium term,31 a master plan \nensuring  integration  between  CIB  and  CMAR,  and  procurement  plans  including  technical \nspecifications  for  appropriate  hardware  and  software  equipment.  MMA  is  considering  a  two-\nphased approach. The first phase under the Project will create a preliminary database listing all \nexisting  collateralized  properties  recorded  with  the  financial  institutions  and  will  involve \npreparation  of  an  action  plan  for  establishment  of  CMAR  including  recommendations  for  the \nlegal or regulatory framework, and equipment needed to integrate all the registration information \nof  CMAR  with  CIB.  The  second  phase32 will  subsequently  implement  the  action  plan,  arrange \nlinks  and  networks,  and  make  the  CMAR  operational.  The  procurement  plan  is  attached  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n\nComponent C: Capacity Building for PPP  \n\n3. \n \n53. \nThe Project envisages supporting the Government with two aspects of developing PPP \ninfrastructure  projects.  The  first  part  of  the  Project  will  assist  the  Government  through  a  PPP \ncapacity building consultancy in assessing the existing enabling and regulatory environment for \nPPP  and  suggesting  measures  and  reforms  required  to  create  a  favorable  and  transparent \nenvironment for developing infrastructure projects through PPP. The Project will also focus on \ndeveloping  capacity  within  the  Government  to  formulate  sectoral  PPP  strategies  and  projects, \nand  manage  PPP  procurement  processes.  A  PPP  cell  will  be  set  up  within  EDU  and  the \nGovernment will depute additional staff to the PPP cell as the current staff of EDU cannot take \non  additional  responsibilities.  An  effective  knowledge-sharing  arrangement  will  be  put  in  place \nbetween MOFT and EDU regarding all past and future initiatives and materials related to PPP. \nThe Project will provide capacity development for the PPP cell as the key IA for the successful \nimplementation of component C.33 Building on this, the second task is to identify and structure \ntwo infrastructure projects using the PPP model on a pilot basis.34 Its target will be to assist the \nGovernment in bidding out two pilot projects on a PPP basis. The time gap between developing \nthe  enabling  environment  and  actual  implementation  of  PPP  pilot  projects  is  reflected  in \nAppendix 8 and Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\na. \n\nPPP Enabling Framework and Capacity Development (Task 1) \n\n \nThis  task  involves  developing  the  enabling  frameworks  for  PPP  and  developing  the \n54. \ncapacity  of  key  government  ministries  to  institutionalize  the  development  and  management \nprocess for PPPs. The Project will support the following three aspects.  \n \nPolicy and Regulatory Framework. Based on the preliminary analysis of issues in key \n55. \nPPP sectors identified, the Project will review the policy for these sectors and develop improved \npolicies  for  supporting  PPP  projects.  It  will  help  draft  regulations  to  improve  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  PPPs,  including  legal,  fiscal,  tax,  foreign  investment  frameworks,  and  other \nincentives.  \n \n                                                 \n31  This is subject to MMA acceptance of the concept as per the findings of the feasibility study.  \n32 Based  on  the  Project\u2019s  outputs,  the  proposed  ADB  project  loan,  to  be  processed  in  2009\u20132010,  could  include  a \ncomponent to establish a basis for introducing a CMAR to be integrated with the CIB. The establishment of the CIB \nand CMAR will run in parallel, however, these two activities will be independent of each other.   \n\n33  The Public Enterprises Monitoring and Evaluation Board at MOFT is one of the most important pillars for enhancing \nPPP  in  the  Maldives.  It  will  work  closely  with  the  PPP  cell  at  EDU  to  address  any  coordination  issues  between \nrelevant ministries and SOEs already undertaking activities envisaged to be developed through PPPs. \n\n34  Through PPP consultants, the Project will assist the Government in identifying two projects that have the potential \nto be developed on a PPP basis; carrying out demand/technical assessment, project structuring, financial analysis, \nand PPP structuring; and developing model bidding documents and development frameworks. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nInstitutional  Framework  and  Capacity  Development.  The  Project  will  assist  the \n56. \nGovernment  in  formulating  institutional  strategies  to  study  current  Government  functions  and \ncapacities;  and  identify  support  required  to  encourage  and  manage  PPP  in  the  identified \nsectors.  It  will  help  develop  the  capacity  of  identified  staff  to  equip  them  with  a  range  of  skills \ncovering technical, financial, and legal aspects needed for effective management and handling \nof PPP projects. \n \n57. \nPPP  Financing  Framework. The Project will help develop two funding mechanisms, a \nproject development fund and a project preparation fund. Given the fragmented demand, PPP \nprojects may not be financially viable at the outset and, as a result, could have long gestation \nperiods.  In  such  a  scenario,  a  dedicated  funding  mechanism  that  supports  projects  especially \nduring  their  early  period  of  development  could  take  the  form  of  a  project  support  fund. \nSimultaneously,  a  project  preparation  fund,  funded  initially  by  the  Government,  should  be \ndeveloped  to  fund  project  preparation  activities  leading  to  successful  selection  of  a  private \ndeveloper. The project preparation fund will be in the nature of a revolving fund, wherein once a \nproject is successfully bid out, the related project preparation costs, such as feasibility studies in \nproject  design,  land  acquisition,  etc.,  would  be  recovered  from  the  successful  bidder  so  that \nfurther new project development activities can be undertaken without the government having to \nincur additional project preparatory costs. \n \n\nConceptualizing and Structuring Two Projects on PPP (Task 2) \n\nb. \n \n\n58. \nThe second task under the PPP component is to assist in structuring and developing two \nidentified  pilot  projects  on  a  PPP  basis\u2014for  example,  one  in  domestic  maritime  transport  and \nlogistics,35 and  another  in  the  power  subsector.36 The  Project  will  help  detail  the  concept  and \nstructures of the projects and carry out financial feasibility studies. The Project will help identify \nvarious PPP models that can be applied and choose the most appropriate model. For chosen \nprojects, partnership frameworks will be developed based on the Government\u2019s objectives and \npriorities for inviting private sector participation.  \n \n59. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  of  the  partnership  framework  identifying  key \nissues and risks in proposed projects and mitigation measures. These will include terms of the \nconcession,  financing,  revenue  risk  and  guarantees,  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the \nGovernment  and  private  sector,  scope  of  transaction,  form  and  level  of  government  support, \nand  other  similar  aspects  impacting  the  value  proposition  for  the  private  and  public  sectors. \nBased  on  the  partnership  framework,  appropriate  project  and  legal  documentation  will  be \nprepared  to  form  the  basis  for  the  transaction  and  partnership.  The  frameworks  will  be \ndiscussed within the Government and accepted before the selection process can be designed \nand run to select a PPP developer. \n\n                                                 \n35 The  domestic  maritime  transport  project  aims  to  provide  regular  and  reliable  ferry  transport  services  within  atolls \nand  between  key  growth  centers  across  key  atolls;  and  to  involve  and  combine  freight  and  resort  transportation \nelements  to  bring  economies  of  scale,  reduce  transport  costs,  and  provide  much  needed  regular  access  to \npopulations and businesses to various services and facilities being developed at these growth centers. Additionally, \nsuch  projects  can  be  combined  with  rights  to  the  development  of  local  transportation  and  logistics  supply  chain \ninvolving  warehousing,  cold  storages,  harbors,  and  other  distribution  networks.  This  will  benefit  local  economies \nand generate demand for the private sector. \n\n36 In line with the draft energy policy, power projects, including projects relating to renewable energy sources such as \nthose  based  on  solar,  wind,  or  hybrid  systems,  are  expected  to  be  conceptualized  and  developed  by  the  private \nsector through innovative packaging allowing economies of scale and savings. The Maldives Electricity Committee \nis a government agency that regulates tariffs of electricity  provided in the islands. The State Electricity Company \nLimited (STELCO) is a leading SOE in providing electricity to 20 major islands including Mal\u00e9. Currently, ADB TA \n(SOE privatization and restructuring) is assisting the restructuring and privatization of STELCO. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\nC. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n \n60. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $7.8 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties  of  around  $47,000.  The  Government  will  finance  local  taxes  and  duties.  The  project \ninvestment plan is provided in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 9. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Costs \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The loan will have a 32-\nyear  term  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and other terms and conditions set out in the loan \nagreement.  The  ADB  financing  will  cover  96.2%  of  the  project  costs,  primarily  for  the \ninternational  consultancy,  turnkey  consultancy  package  for  CIB,  and  establishment  of  a  CSF \nand LCF. The Government will finance $0.3 million equivalent (3.8% of the project cost) as in-\nkind  support  primarily  for  counterpart  staff,  communications,  workshops,  and  administration \nsupport. The financing plan is provided in Table 2.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernmenta \n \na  Includes  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  communication,  administration  support, \n\n% \n96.2 \n3.8 \n100.0 \n\nTotal \n7.5 \n0.3 \n7.8 \n\nTotal \n\ncontingencies.

Under  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  BML,  the  Government  will  relend \n$3.0  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  to  BML  to  develop  an  LCF  on  terms  and  conditions \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  relending  will  need  to  reflect  the  costs  of \nraising  such  funds  locally  and  avoid  discouraging  domestic  resource  mobilization.  Under  a \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  with  MMA, 37 the  Government  will  relend  $720,000  equivalent  to \nMMA  for  the  setting  up  of  the  CIB,  drafting  of  the  legal  regulatory  plan  and  framework  and \nexecution  for  the  central  assets  registry  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nGovernment  has  indicated  that  the  terms  of  the  loans  to  BML  and  MMA  will  not  exceed  24 \nyears, including a 3-year grace period. These loans will be disbursed over 3 years, subject to a \nmidterm review after 18 months to review disbursement progress and refine the arrangements \nas needed.  \n \nOnlending.  The  maximum  subloan  size  for  individual  applicants  will  be  Rf1,024,000 \n63. \n($80,000).  Individual  subloans  exceeding  that  amount  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval. \nThe  terms  and  conditions  of  onlending  will  be  on  a  commercial  basis  at  the  prevailing  market \nrates  of  interest  and  tenor,  reflecting  costs  of  raising  such  funds  locally  and  guaranteeing \nadequate spread of interest rates for BML to cover transaction costs and risks.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nKey Project Management Entities \n\n \n\n \n\n64.  MOFT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  Project  and \ncoordinating  the  activities  of  all  IAs.  MOFT  will  liaise  with  ADB  on  all  project  administration \nmatters  in  general.  The  IAs  will  be  (i)  MEDT  for  component  A;  (ii)  BML  for  component  B, \nsubcomponent  1;  (iii)  MMA  for  component  B,  subcomponent  2;  and  (iv)  a  PPP  cell  within \nMEDT\u2019s EDU for component C. Each IA will be responsibility for the day-to-day implementation \nof project components within their respective mandates. A PMU will be established in the EDU \nand will be headed by a project director. The project director will be responsible for coordinating \nthe  project  activities,  overseeing  logistical  arrangements,  and  performing  other  assignments \nnecessary for project implementation. The PMU will also comprise a project coordinator who will \nreport to the project director. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Steering Committee  \n\n65. \nA  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  MEDT  deputy  minister  and  comprise  the  executive \ndirectors  from  MOFT,  MEDT,  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development,  and  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nNational  Development;  a  senior  executive  director  of  MMA;  an  assistant  general  manager  of \nBML; the project director; and executive directors from other ministries and agencies, on a need \nbasis.  One  representative  each  from  MNCCI  and  WEC  will  attend  the  PSC  meetings  as \nobservers.  All  members  will  have  an  alternative  member  in  case  the  member  is  otherwise \nengaged.  The  PSC  will  include  a  member  from  each  ministry  related  to  sectors  identified  for \nPPPs. The project coordinator under EDU will serve as the PSC secretary. The PSC will meet \nat least once every quarter to discuss the agenda finalized by the secretary and circulated to the \nmembers in advance of the meeting. The IAs will prepare annual work plans and budgets to be \npresented  to  the  PSC  for  its  endorsement.  Moreover,  the  reports  generated  through  the \nparticipatory  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  system  will  be  presented  to  the  PSC  on  a \nbiannual basis. The project management organization structure is given in Appendix 10. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n37 The subsidiary loan agreement between the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) and MMA has been made in \n\nline with government policy and arrangement mechanisms in the Maldives. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  within  2.5  years.  It  will  be  completed  by  28  February \n\n66. \n2011. The overall project implementation schedule is summarized in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n \n67. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). For procurement of goods and \nservices  to  be  financed  by  subloans,  subborrowers  will  follow  procurement  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  To  be  acceptable  to  ADB,  such  procurement  procedures  will  be  (i)  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial  practices,  (ii)  appropriate  under  the \ncircumstances,  and  (iii)  comply  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date).  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Selection  and  engagement  of \nconsulting  services  will  use  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  80:20  ratio,  for \nconsulting firms (Appendix 7). The turnkey consultancy packages for CIB under component B, \nsubcomponent  2,  are  attached  in  Appendix  7.38 The  Project  will  finance  79  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  124  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nterms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  attached  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  The \nGovernment will be responsible for the procurement plan, and ADB will carry out reviews of the \nGovernment\u2019s procedures, documents, bid evaluations, award recommendations, and contract \nin accordance with the agreed procedures.   \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n68. \nImmediately  after  loan  effectiveness,  MOFT  will  establish  two  imprest  accounts  to \nexpedite project implementation through timely release of ADB funds for eligible expenditures. \nThe  first  imprest  account  will  finance  all  activities  under  component  A,  subcomponent  2  of \ncomponent B, and component C. It will be established within MMA in the name of MOFT. The \nsecond imprest account will finance all activities under subcomponent 1 of component B and will \nbe open within MMA in the name of MOFT.39 The initial advance to the first imprest account in \nMOFT  will  be  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of  project  implementation  or \n$380,000,  whichever  is  lower.  The  second  imprest  account  in  MMA  will  be  given  an  initial \nadvance  of  the  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of  project  implementation  or \n$300,000, whichever is lower. The currency of these imprest accounts will be the dollar. Except \nas  ADB  may  otherwise  agree,  BML  will  establish  a  second-generation  imprest  account  within \nBML  for  the  LCF  to  be  financed  through  the  second  imprest  account.  The  currency  of  the \nsecond-generation  imprest  account  will  be  the  rufiyaa.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into \nthe second-generation imprest account will not exceed the lower of the estimated expenditure \nfor the first 6 months of project implementation, or the equivalent of $300,000. \n\n69.  MOFT  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and  administering  the  imprest  accounts.  The \nproject loan will be disbursed using the statement of expenditure procedure to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB statement of expenditures procedure will \nbe used to reimburse or liquidate and replenish the imprest accounts for individual payments not \n\n                                                 \n38  ADB is jointly working with the International Finance Corporation for the establishment and implementation of the \n\nCIB. More detailed terms of reference are attached in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n39  Supplementary Appendix G provides more detailed information on the fund flow.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nexceeding  $50,000.  BML  will  be  responsible  for  managing  a  second-generation  imprest \naccount;  it  will  be  subject  to  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  in  place  between  BML  and  the \nGovernment.  The  disbursement  procedures  relating  to  LCF  under  subcomponent  1  of \ncomponent B should be in accordance with the development finance institution loan procedure \ndescribed  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nthe detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. With respect to the \nfree limit, the maximum loan size for individual applicants permitted under the loan agreement \nwill be $80,000 (or Rf1,024,000). \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n70. \nThe  PMU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  imprest  accounts  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and will have these accounts and records audited \nannually  in  accordance  with  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  accounts,  including \nstatement of expenditures, will be provided to ADB within 6 months at the end of the fiscal year. \nThe annual audit will provide an opinion on the soundness of the imprest accounts and the use \nof the statement of expenditures procedure. ADB retains the right to (i) audit and examine the \nrecords  and  accounts  including  those  of  the  IAs,  and  (ii)  verify  the  validity  of  the  certification \nissued  by  the  Government  for  each  withdrawal  application.  The  PMU  will  submit  quarterly \nprogress  reports  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  project  loan  proceeds,  project  administration, \nand financial management.40 \n \n71. \nThe  consultants  recruited  under  the  Project  will  prepare  (i)  an  inception  report  within  4 \nweeks  of  service  commencement;  (ii)  midterm  reports  (including  quarterly  reports)  at \nappropriate stages of the Project; (iii) a draft final report 4 weeks before completing the contract; \nand (iv) a final report after incorporating comments from ADB, MOFT, and the IAs. A tripartite \nmeeting of the Government, ADB, and the consultants will be carried out prior to finalizing each \nundertaking and terminating each contract. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n72. \nThe  PMU,  drawing  on  data  from  the  IAs,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project \nperformance management system that will generate annual reports every 6 months. The system \nwill be established, as agreed between the Government and ADB, to ensure that the Project is \nmanaged efficiently, benefits are maximized, and social impacts are monitored. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n73. \nThe Government and ADB will review project implementation at least three times a year. \nADB  will  field  regular  review  missions,  including  midterm  and  project  completion  review \nmissions  to  coincide  whenever  possible  with  the  program  reviews  and  tripartite  meetings.  A \ncomprehensive midterm review at approximately 18 months from the date of loan effectiveness \nwill be undertaken to evaluate progress, and MOFT and the IAs will participate in the midterm \nreview.  These  reviews  will  include  an  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and progress with the project agenda. \n \n\n                                                 \n40 The reports will include (i) 6 monthly and annual project implementation reports, (ii) a midterm review report, and \n(iii)  a  project  completion  report  to  be  submitted  no  later  than  6  months  after  project  completion.  The  reports  and \nconsolidating  inputs  from  the  implementing  agencies  will  cover  (i)  expenditures,  (ii)  activities  financed,  (iii)  a \nsummary of audit issues, and (iv) progress of project components. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n\n9. \n\nGovernance and Corruption Risks \n\n \n74. \nGovernance  and  corruption  risks  in  the  Project  can  be  categorized  broadly  as  policy- \nand legislation-related, capability-related, and project management-related. First, these include \nweak  policy  on  the  privatization  policy  and  PPPs,  and  potential  delays  in  developing  the  legal \nframework  to  set  up  a  CIB  and  for  a  basis  of  introducing  secured  transactions.  Second,  risks \ninclude  capacity  constraints  in  MOFT  and  the  IAs,  and  lack  of  sustainability  of  capacity \ndevelopment efforts in the Project. Third, risks include political interference in access to credit \nthrough the LCF, complex MOFT and IA arrangements, misuse in the LCF, lack of engagement \nof  participants,  lack  of  full  adherence  or  very  rigorous  criteria  for  credit  eligibility,  transaction \ncosts in excess of perceived benefits, and inability of project beneficiaries to meet expectations. \nSeveral mitigating measures have been proposed such as (i) capacity development support, (ii) \nthe Government commitment through assurances in the Project, (iii) proper design of the terms \nof references of consultants and monitoring of their performances, and (iv) encouraging private \nsector  associations  to  participate  in  the  Project.  Appendix  11  provides  a  risk  analysis,  and \nsuggests appropriate risk mitigation measures. \n \n75. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  are \nincluded  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA,  IAs,  PMU,  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nProject  will  introduce  additional  specific  measures  to  enhance  governance  and  prevent \ncorruption.  Such  measures  include  (i)  continued  consultant  support  to  PMU  staff  on \nprocurement  and  project  management;  and  (ii)  random  and  independent  spot  checks  by  ADB \nreview missions on procurement and financial project accounts. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nExpected Benefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \n76. \nThe Project is expected to contribute to (i) an improved business environment for PSD \nwith  enhanced  institutional  capacity  and  financial  services  outreach;  (ii)  improved  access  to \ncredit  by  MSMEs  through  better  use  of  credit  information;  and  (iii)  increased  BDS  for \nenterprises to access training, consulting, marketing, and information. As a whole, the private \nsector will benefit from the Project\u2019s holistic approach to ensuring an enabling environment for \ndoing  business,  better  access  to  financing,  enhanced  business  support  infrastructure,  and \nincreased market access and product competitiveness for inclusive growth, as well as creating \nnew  employment  opportunities  for  people  residing  in  the  atolls  especially  the  youth.  About \n200\u2013300 MSMEs in targeted regions are expected to receive training and technical support on \na  cost-sharing  basis  to  increase  product  competitiveness  during  project  implementation. \nUnder  a  pilot  project,  around  70  subloans  will  be  provided  to  MSMEs  in  these  regions.  The \nProject  is  unlikely  to  have  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impact.  Subprojects  to  be \nfunded  from  the  LCF  fund  are  unlikely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts. \nSubprojects will be required to comply with applicable government environmental regulations \nand  standards.  Moreover,  PPPs  will  expedite  enhanced  private  sector  participation  and \nbusiness expansion by MSMEs and bidding of two PPP subprojects, which will help increase \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nRisk Analysis \n\nemployment, facilitate MSMEs to access the market, and enhance quality of life of residents in \nthe targeted regions. The summary initial poverty and social sector analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n \n77. \nRisks  are  linked  to  (i)  political  factors,  (ii)  interministerial  coordination  factors,  (iii) \ncapacity  constraint  factors,  and  (iv)  PPP-related  factors.  First,  political  risks  suggest  that, \ndespite  technical  merits  across  reform  initiatives  supported  under  the  Project,  some  initiatives \nwill require strong political resolve to implement. Second, the project activities involve a cross-\nsection  of  the  MSME  sector  and  various  ministries.  Therefore,  close  coordination  is  required \namong  relevant  government  agencies  and  with  the  private  sector,  principally  through  the \nbusiness  associations  of  commerce  and \nto  support  and  oversee  project \nimplementation.  Third,  various  departments  and  agencies  have  capacity  constraints.  Unless \ncapacity  is  enhanced,  effective  implementation  of  the  reforms  will  be  at  risk.  And  fourth, \npreparation  and  development  of  projects  on  a  PPP  basis  is  a  complex  process  requiring  the \nGovernment\u2019s strong commitment and support as well as public acceptance. The Government \nwill  be  assisted  by  consultants  to  develop  PPP  models  and  to  select  projects  which  are \nfinancially viable.  \n\nindustry, \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n \n78. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nWithin 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will set up a PSC chaired \nby the deputy minister of economic development and trade and composed of the \nexecutive directors of MOFT, MEDT, Ministry of Atolls Development, Ministry of \nPlanning  and  National  Development,  a  senior  executive  director  of  MMA,  an \nassistant general manager of BML, project director, and executive directors from \nother  ministries  and  agencies,  as  appropriate.

The  Maldives,  a  small  island  economy,  comprises  20  natural \n1. \natolls  with  a  total  land  mass  of  less  than  300  square  kilometers  (km2)  spread  over  900  km2. \nThe  Maldives  has  a  number  of  economic  disadvantages  similar  to  other  small  island \neconomies  that  undermine  the  country\u2019s  international  competitiveness.  In  small  economies \nlike the Maldives, the percentage deviation of costs from a medium-sized economy are more \nthan 70% for sea freight, nearly 50% for electricity and telephone service, and more than 30% \nfor  unskilled  labor  and  fuel.  In  sectors  like  tourism1,  these  high  costs  translate  into  a  60% \noverall  increase  in  the  cost  of  tourism,  which  can  be  passed  onto  the  high-end  tourism \nconsumer,  but  are  not  readily  transferable  to  products  like  handicrafts,  agro-industrial \nproducts, and manufactured goods that compete in fairly homogeneous international product \nmarkets. From a policy perspective, this does not suggest the need for protection against the \nrest of the world, but rather proactive policies that seek to overcome or partially compensate \nfor the economic disadvantages associated with the high production and trading costs.  \n \n2. \nEconomic  Growth.  Despite  its  intrinsic  competitive  disadvantages,  the  Maldives  is \none of the fastest growing economies in South Asia. Two sectors, tourism and fisheries, have \nbeen  the  driving  forces  behind  the  expansion  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and \nemployment generation, and have created linkages to other subsectors like local handicrafts, \nand tourism. In 2006, the sharp rise in real GDP reflected a resumption of growth following the \ndevastation  that  occurred  throughout  the  country  as  a  result  of  the  2004  tsunami.  The \nrecovery  has  been  largely  driven  by  tourism  and  brings  the  country  back  to  its  steady-state \ngrowth path of around 6% a year.2  \n \n3. \nRegional  Growth  Inequalities.  The  benefits  of  the  country\u2019s  high  economic  growth \nrates  in  the  past  10  years  have  not  been  equitably  distributed  to  the  population.  Average \nhousehold  income  in  the  atolls  is  55%  of  that  in  Mal\u00e9.3 Decentralization  of  economic  activity \nhas  been  undermined  by  lack  of  infrastructure,  a  poorly  developed  interisland  transportation \nsystem,  financial  system  constraints  to  credit  for  businesses,  and  legal  and  regulatory \nbarriers.  Greater  opportunities  for  people  living  in  Mal\u00e9  have  produced  a  fourfold  population \nexpansion  in  the  past  20  years,  and  Mal\u00e9  now  has  a  population  density  that  is  among  the \nhighest in the world, a situation made all the more severe by the recent tsunami. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nSeveral  areas  of  the  Maldives  regulatory  environment  rank  fairly  high  in  affecting  the \nease  of  doing  business,  but  the  country\u2019s  comparative  position  recently  declined  because  of \nincreased  burdens  in  several  areas  that  especially  impact  micro-,  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (MSMEs). Downgrading has occurred in (i) ease of employing workers, (ii) starting a \nbusiness, (iii) protection of investors, (iv) contract enforcement, (v) trading across borders, and \n(vi)  ease  of  closing  a  business.  In  other  business  regulatory  environments,  the  country\u2019s \ncomparative ranking has not changed from a year earlier, that is, no comparative improvement \nin the business regulatory environment has been made. \n                                                 \n1   In  addition  to  1,190  inhabited  islands,  87  islands  are  designated  and  developed  as  tourist  resorts,  with  an \n\nMajor Constraints \n\nadditional 11 islands currently being set aside for development. \n\n2  For more details, see Supplementary Appendix A (Sector and Subsector Analysis).  \n3  Ministry  of  Planning,  Republic  of  the  Maldives.  2004.  2002\u20132003  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey. \n\nMale. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nInternal  Constraints.  The  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  that \n5. \nsurveyed business conditions and perceptions by MSMEs in three key regions of the Maldives.4 \nThe  principal  concerns  of  enterprises  in  the  northern  and  southern  regions  include  lack  of \ntechnically skilled labor and management, accounting skills, and market information. Availability \nof  skilled  labor  is  the  only  major  problem  for  enterprises  in  the  northern  region,  while  in  the \nsouthern  region,  it  ranks  below  all  but  cost  of  capital.  Constraints  related  to  capital  and  labor \ncosts are low in both regions. \n \nExternal  Constraints.  Enterprises  in  the  atolls  rank  labor  issues  high  and  perceive \n6. \nforeign  competition  to  be  a  threat  to  their  operations.  They  identify  bureaucratic  and \nadministrative  costs  related  to  fees,  licensing  costs,  and  permits;  and  customs  and  trade \nregulations  as  major  constraints.  Among  factors  having  a  negligible  constraint  on  the \nenterprises  are  utility  costs;  cost  and  access  to  finance;  and  access  to  land,  utilities,  and \ntransport facilities. Few enterprises actually consider using external financial sources. Similarly, \nland and transport services, normally considered to be important constraints, are not ranked as \nmajor  constraints  to  these  businesses  because  they  tend  to  operate  within  existing \ncircumstances and have limited expectations about changes in their operating environment. In \ncontrast, MSMEs operating principally in Mal\u00e9 report limited access to, and cost of, finance. \n \n7. \nSkills  Deficiencies.  According  to  the  7th  National  Development  Plan  (NDP),  the \nMaldives  has  one  of  the  lowest  labor  force  participation  rates  in  South  Asia  (47.7%).  One \nproblem  is  the  lack  of  appropriate  skills  needed  for  existing  employment  opportunities. \nEducational  and  vocational  institutions  have  not  inculcated  enterprise  as  a  career  option  or \nprovided appropriate business orientation and support skills. Despite some improvement, lack of \nskilled labor continues to be a major problem, and has created reliance on migrant labor from \nneighboring countries. \n \n8. \nAccess to Financing. The Maldives ranks 132nd worldwide on the comparative ease of \ngetting credit; this is well below most other South Asian countries. The poor ranking is largely \ndue  to  the  complete  absence  of  a  public  or  private  credit  registry  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of \ncredit information among lenders. As a result, using a changing pool of assets as security for a \nloan  is  not  practical.  This  makes  security  agreements  for  MSMEs  highly  risky,  costly,  and \ndifficult  to  enforce.  Moreover,  the  financial  sector  of  the  Maldives  is  narrow  with  one  locally \nowned commercial bank, Bank of Maldives (BML); branches of three South Asian commercial \nbanks;  and  a  branch  of  Hongkong  and  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  (HSBC)  international \nbank.  Banking  is  regulated  by  Maldives  Monetary  Authority  (MMA),  which  acts  as  the  central \nbank.  The  nonbank  financial  subsector  comprises  a  government  provident  fund,  a  finance \nleasing  company,  a  housing  bank,  two  insurance  companies  registered  in  the  country,  and \nsome agents for overseas insurance companies. Capital market operations for securities trading \nare limited. Three state-owned enterprises are quoted on the stock exchange (BML, Maldivian \nTransport and Construction Company, and State Trading Organization). \n \n\n                                                 \n4  A survey was conducted on the ADB TA 4745 on Small and Medium Enterprise Development in 2007.

Concerns are for high interest \nrates, difficulties in arranging collateral for \nloans, and inadequate payment \nperiods/maturity of loans.

Enhance access to finance \n(LCF, CIB, capacity building).  \n\nFacilitate the establishment and growth of MSMEs \nthrough providing access to business support \nservices. Encourage technology transfer, \ninnovation and creativity for business (p. 52). \n\nIn addition to the operation of the BDSCs and CSF, \nprovide capacity building training to leading private \nsector association by linking MSMEs with available \nmarkets and providing upgraded consultancy.  \n\nDevelop guidelines to strengthen institutional \ncapacity, staff training, and productivity (p. 51).  \n\nProvide capacity building to the public sector policy \nmaker to improve design and implementation of the \nProject. \n\nIncrease human resource capacity to support \nsector development and diversification in fisheries \nand agriculture (p. 60 and 63). \n\nFisheries and agriculture are targeted areas where \ncapacity building and training will be provided \nunder the BDSCs and CSF mechanism.  \n\nGoal 3 of the 7th NDP: Invest in strategic and state of the art infrastructure to enable ease of \nmovement, enhanced access to services, and the building of competitive advantage \n\nThe Government\u2019s development priorities \n\nProposed components under Project \n\nEnable access to finance for private and public \nenterprises to establish inter- and intra-atoll ferry \nservices to ensure that the transport system \nmeets the mobility needs of the people and \nfacilitates efficient movement of goods (p. 78\u201379). \n\nIntroduce and demonstrate sustainable solar and \nwind energy applications, and facilitate/promote \nthe role of private sector in the development of the \nenergy sector (pp. 94\u201395). \n\nPPP component aims to develop and bid out PPP \nprojects such as regular and reliable ferry transport \nservices within atolls and between key growth \ncenters across key atolls, which will combine the \ndevelopment of local transportation and logistics \nsupply chain (warehousing, cold storages, and \nother distribution networks). \n\nIn addition to transport services, the PPP \ncomponent aims to develop and bid out PPP \nprojects relating to renewable energy sources.  \n\nBDSC  =  business  development  services  center;  CSF  =  cost-sharing  facility;  LCF  =  line  of  credit  facility;  MSME  = \nmicro-,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprise;  NDP  =  national  development  plan;  PPP  =  public\u2013private  partnership; \nPSD = private sector development.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Republic of the Maldives. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37\n\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SERVICE CENTERS AND COST-SHARING FACILITY \n \n\nBusiness Development Services Centers (BDSCs) in Target Regions \n\nA. \n \nStrategy  and  Organization.  Field  research  conducted  for  the  Project  shows  that  the \n1. \neconomic  activities  of  micro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  in  the  atolls  are \nlimited. Two of the major obstacles are (i) limited access to all types of business development \nservices  (BDS)  like  information,  marketing  services,  communication,  and  training;  and  \n(ii) inability to access finance at reasonable costs. On the supply side, the atolls have no private \nsector-based  providers  of  BDS,  and  only  a  few  public  sector  providers  through  trainings  on  a \nnonregular  basis.  On  the  demand  side,  MSMEs  are  unaware  of  the  concept  of  professional \nsupport for enterprise development, despite their urgent need for it. The current market volume \nof  BDS  is  nonexistent,  as  all  services  from  public  providers  are  delivered  free  of  cost.  In  the \nabsence  of  private  sector  BDS  providers  in  the  regions,  as  well  as  business  membership \norganizations  like  chambers  of  commerce  or  business  associations,  business  development \nservice centers (BDSCs) will be established as new institutions in each of the focal regions to \ndeliver BDS to MSMEs and to facilitate local economic development.   \n \n2. \nFunctions.  The  BDSCs  will  be  the  principal  vehicle  for  delivery  of  BDS  products  to \nMSMEs and will facilitate cluster development in the atolls. Each focal region will have a BDSC \noperation  desk  in  its  key  atoll;  a  central  BDSC  at  Mal\u00e9  will  offer  a  wide  range  of  services  to \nMSMEs  and  cooperative  initiatives  at  cost-based  prices.  As  neither  start-ups  nor  established \nMSMEs  have  been  exposed  to  the  concept  of  professional,  and  demand-oriented  delivery  of \nBDS  at  market  prices,  they  are  unprepared  to  pay  the  cost-based  price  for  such  services.  A \ncost-sharing  facility  (CSF)  will  be  established  as  the  principal  funding  mechanism  for  the \ndevelopment  of  a  commercial  BDS  market.  The  CSF  will  enable  the  BDSCs  to  initially  offer \nservices at a low and subsidized price. It will support the BDSCs in developing service products \nand provide substantial income to the BDSCs during the pilot operation of the CSF. The BDSCs \nwill  have  a  business  plan  indicating  core  activities,  required  investment,  and  planned  revenue \nstreams.  They  will  develop  a  clear  strategy  comprising  a  vision,  mission,  goals,  and  line  of \nactivities, as well as an annual operating plan.  \n \nObjectives and Services to Be Provided. The BDSCs will have three objectives: (i) to \n3. \nprovide  BDS  products  to  start-ups  and  established  MSMEs;  (ii)  to  facilitate  local  economic \ndevelopment and cluster development in their respective regions; and (iii) to link start-ups and \nother types of MSMEs to financing opportunities. To meet its objectives, the BDSCs will offer a \nwide range of services classified in four categories: (i) consulting services for business planning \nand  business  counseling,  identification  and  provision  of  information,  and  coaching;  (ii)  training \nservices  on  costing  and  pricing,  marketing  and  sales,  accounting,  and  entrepreneurship;  (iii) \nservices for facilitating market access, access to finance, and formation of cooperatives; and (iv) \ngovernment-related services covering support for business registration and licensing, linking to \ngovernment databases and to government extension services. To sustain its pilot operation of \nthe  CSF,  the  BDSCs  are  envisaged  to  become  independent  and  market-oriented  service \nproviders with development and commercial objectives.  \n \n4. \nStaffing.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the  Enterprise  Development  Unit \n(EDU) will be the overall coordinating body for the BDSCs. It will disseminate information, and \nmonitor and evaluate BDSC services. The project coordinators of the PMU will be recruited on \nan  international  contract  and  work  for  24  person-months  intermittently  for  the  duration  of  the \nProject.  The  project  coordinator  will  be  supported  by  one  national  MSME  portal  and \ncommunication  specialist,  and  one  national  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  who  will  also \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nwork for the duration of the Project. The PMU  will share EDU administrative and support staff \nduring the pilot phase. \n \n5. \nThe central BDSC will be housed within EDU and comprise one BDS officer in the pilot \nphase,  and  need-based  consultants.  It  will  share  administrative  and  support  staff  already \npresent  within  EDU  during  the  pilot  phase.  The  BDSC  operation  desks  at  Hithadhoo  and \nKulhudhuffushi will be housed within the regional development and management offices. They \nwill  each  comprise  one  full-time  nationally  recruited  business  development  officer  for  the \nduration  of  the  Project.  One  administrative  staff  and  one  support  staff  will  be  deputed  from \namong  existing  staff  of  the  regional  development  and  management  offices  to  these  operation \ndesks to work on a full-time basis.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  capacity  development  support  to  EDU  by  financing  the  cost  of \n6. \nthe project coordinator, MSME portal and communications specialist, monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist,  and  administrative  staff.  In  addition,  training  programs  will  be  conducted  for  regular \nEDU  staff  in  marketing,  financing,  and  communication  skills.  The  Project  will  support  EDU  in \ndesigning  and  implementing  a  media  campaign,  and  developing  and  registering  an  EDU  web \nportal.    \n \n7. \nThe Maldives National Chamber of Commerce and Industries (MNCCI) and the Women \nEntrepreneurs Council (WEC) will supporting the operation of the BDSCs by providing linkages \nwith  available  markets  and  consulting  service.  The  Project  will  support  MNCCI  in  its  strategic \nplanning  process,  including  the  elaboration  of  an  operations  plan  and  a  human  resource \ndevelopment plan, as well as training recruited professional staff. WEC needs a secretariat with \nsuitably  qualified  staff  to  undertake  quality  control,  inventory  management,  marketing,  and \nwebsite maintenance. The Project will support the capacity building of WEC to undertake such \nactivities more efficiently and provide extension services to the BDSCs.  \n \nMonitoring and Evaluation on Performance Measurement. The BDSCs will establish \n8. \na  performance  measurement  framework  as  a  systematic  tool  for  measuring  operating  results \nrelated to the centers\u2019 activities, including CSF-based financial support to entrepreneurs. Among \nthe information gathered by the centers and published on a quarterly basis will be the (i) number \nof  businesses  consulted;  (ii)  number  of  business  plans  prepared;  (iii)  number  of  financial \napplications  processed  for  each  of  the  financing  mechanisms  supported  by  the  BDSCs;  \n(iv)  breakdown  of  clientele  by  sector  and  size  of  enterprises;  (v)  number  of  courses  provided \nand participants in each course; (vi) participant evaluations of each training course; (vii) revenue \nfrom conditional support for successful applications to various financing mechanisms; (viii) other \nrevenue  sources;  and  (ix)  CSF  management,  allocation,  and  monitoring  analysis.  Each  BDSC \n(central  and  local  operation  desks)  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  a  results-based \nmanagement and accountability framework.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nInstitutional Setup of a CSF. A CSF will be set up within the central BDSC. The central \nBDSC  will  act  as  the  CSF  management  unit,  headed  by  an  international  consultant.  It  will  be \nresponsible for project analysis, dissemination of information, marketing, financial management, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and coordination with EDU and other government stakeholders.  \n \nPrinciple  of  Services.  The  BDSCs  will  offer  a  wide  range  of  services  to  MSMEs  and \n10. \ncooperative  initiatives  at  cost-based  prices  (paragraph  2).  The  CSF  will  enable  the  BDSCs  to \ninitially  offer  services  at  a  low,  and  subsidized  price  to  demonstrate  value  for  money,  and \n\nCost-Sharing Facility on a Pilot Basis \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39\n\nestablish successful case studies to generate demand for BDS on a market price basis in the \nfuture. Charging for services during the initial stage of the Project will ensure that only serious \ncases come to the BDSCs and that it is a demand-driven effort. \n \nAdministration  Mechanism.  The  CSF  PMU  will  work  with  a  subcommittee  for  initial \n11. \nscreening  and  provision  of  its  recommendations  to  the  project  steering  committee  for  final \napproval  of  the  cost-sharing  grant.  The  BDSCs  will  be  accountable  to  the  project  steering \ncommittee. The subcommittee will be chaired by the project coordinator with EDU, MNCCI, and \nWEC  each  nominating  one  representative.  A  quorum  of  three  members  will  be  required  for \nfinalizing  recommendations  and  taking  decisions  on  forwarding  the  applications  to  the  project \nsteering committee. The decisions of the subcommittee will be by majority vote with the project \ncoordinator retaining the veto right for nonapproval. The reasons for vetoing any proposal will be \nwell documented by the project coordinator.  \n \n12. \nEligible  Applicants.  The  main  target  group  for  grants  will  be  MSMEs  with  operations \nbased  in  the  northern  and  southern  regions,  1 and  with  50  employees  or  less.  One  of  the \nprerequisites for entrepreneurs to receive CSF support will be the completion of an application \nsubmitted to the CSF subcommittee  through the BDSCs.  Only domestically owned MSMEs or \nservice  providers  will  be  eligible.  Parastatals  (owned  or  controlled  wholly  or  partly  by  the \ngovernment),  government  entities,  and  other  MSMEs,  or  service  providers  where  the \ngovernment or its agencies have management control, by virtue of being the largest shareholder \nor  by  virtue  of  having  a  board  majority,  will  not  be  eligible.  The  CSF  supports  group  activities \ncovering more than one MSME or service provider, for instance, those sponsored by business \nor trade associations, MNCCI, WEC, or organized clusters where the benefits are widespread. \nApplications made on a group basis will be evaluated and processed as a single application.  \n \n13. \nSize  of  Grant.  The  CSF  is  to  reduce  the  cost  of  external  service  provision  by \ncofinancing projects of applicants with a flat rate of 80% of the total project cost. The maximum \nindividual  support  under  the  CSF  will  be  Rf51,200  ($4,000),  with  an  average  of  Rf25,600 \n($2,000), to assist a maximum of 200 projects during the implementation period on a pilot basis. \nHowever, large matching grants will have a maximum of Rf512,000 ($40,000) with an average \nof Rf192,000 ($15,000), to assist a maximum of 30 cooperative projects during the period.2 The \nCSF  will  limit  applications  by  applying  a  minimum  grant  amount  of  Rf12,800  ($1,000)  and  a \nmaximum  grant  amount  of  Rf512,000  to  maintain  reasonable  administrative  costs  and  ensure \nthat the main beneficiaries are served.   \n \nEligible  Services.  Clearly  defined  approval  criteria  will  be  prepared  to  support  the \n14. \ndecision-making of the CSF subcommittee and project steering committee. The application form \nwill  include information  about  the  nature  of  business,  the  purpose  of  the  project,  details  about \nrequested  support,  market  coverage,  existing  and  needed  equity,  enterprise  experience, \nexpected  employment  generation,  and  contribution  to  island  infrastructure.  Applications  from \n                                                 \n1  Under  the  7th  National  Development  Plan,  the  Government  emphasizes  the  importance  of  reducing  regional \ndifferentials and promoting growth and employment opportunities, particularly in the far north and far south atolls. \nBased  on consultation  with stakeholders, the Project is designed to start up its operations in these two domestic \nregions (southern and northern regions).  \n\n2  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Small and Medium Enterprise Development. \nManila (TA 4745-MLD, approved on 19 December, for $600,000). The TA included an MSME market survey and \nthe anticipated demand for grants, and maximum and average sizes under the CSF are calculated based on (i) the \nprojection  of  total  average  number  of  MSMEs  during  project  implementation  in  targeted  regions,  based  on  the \nlatest  statistics  from  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade;  (ii)  priority  sectors  (fishery  processing, \nagricultural  commercialization,  handicrafts,  and  tourism-related  activities)  for  cooperative  efforts;  and  (iii) \ninformation on average yearly spending and sale size of MSMEs from the MSME survey.  \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nindividuals  and  groups  will  be  encouraged,  especially  from  cooperatives  or  cluster-based \ngroups. Examples of eligible services to be supported by the CSF will include training business \nmanagement courses, hiring a consultant to create new handicraft designs, hiring an expert to \nimprove  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  fish  processing,  developing  new  market  access,  and \nsupporting the application for financing to purchase capital equipment. For each eligible service \nusage  supported  by  the  CSF,  the  concerned  MSME  will  be  expected  to  provide  at  least  one \ndeliverable. The CSF management unit will verify that the activity has taken place as approved. \nDepending  on  the  circumstance,  a  defined  deliverable  may  consist,  for  instance,  of  a  detailed \nengineering  drawing,  a  product  prototype  incorporating  quality  improvements,  a  training \ncertificate,  or  an  externally  commissioned  market  report.  Sample  service  usage  includes  in-\nfactory consultancy and short-term contract management services, for example, up to 3 months \nof an introduced expert would normally be eligible, but new permanent staff appointments would \nnot.  The  length  of  time  for  which  temporary  contract  management  could  be  supported  will \ndepend  on  the  time  required  for  the  required  knowledge  transfer  and  technical  assistance. \nPriority will be given for services that can eventually be easily replicated. \n \nEligible  Expenditures.  Expenditures  on  service  fees,  and  travel  and  incidental \n15. \nexpenses  charged  at  cost,  incurred  wholly  and  exclusively  on  a  CSF-approved  service  and \ntravel  usage  will  be  eligible  for  grant  support.  Salaries  for  staff  employed  by  the  MSME  and \nrecurring costs such as royalty fees will not be eligible. No single recipient MSME  or group of \nMSMEs  will  receive  total  grants  in excess  of  a  cumulative  limit  of  Rf512,000  ($40,000)  unless \nexpressly approved by the project steering committee. \n \n16. \nThe CSF will operate on a first come, first served basis in northern and southern region. \nTo enhance transparency and efficiency of CSF implementation, the project coordinator will help \nwith management of the facility during the operation period to transfer facility management skills \nand expertise. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n41\n\nLINE OF CREDIT FACILITY PILOT OPERATION \n \n\n1. \nEligibility  Criteria  for  Subloans.  The  line  of  credit  facility  (LCF)  will  be  managed  by \nBank of Maldives (BML) to promote micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) by \nproviding them with financing for investment. The eligibility criteria for such financing will be (i) \nthe  MSME  has  50  or  fewer  employees  and  is  registered  in  the  MSME  database  of  the \nEnterprise  Development  Unit  (EDU); 1  (ii)  the  MSME\u2019s  activities  focus  on  target  clusters \n(agricultural  commercialization,  fishery  processing,  handicrafts,  and  tourism-related  activities); \n(iii)  the  MSME\u2019s  operations  are  based  on  two  focus  regions  (northern  and  southern  domestic \nregions); and (iv) the MSME has adequate cash flow or enterprise budget as well as collateral. \nThe adequacy of cash flow, enterprise budget, and default risk assessment criteria will be well \ndefined  and  agreed  to  at  the  inception  of  the  facility  by  the  ADB,  BML,  and  EDU.  The \nGovernment  is  expected  to  retain  the  right  to  terminate  or  suspend  the  LCF  after  a  specific \nduration to be specified at the initiation of LCF. \n \n2. \nRelending. The Government will borrow from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and bear \nthe foreign exchange risk of the loan. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT), on behalf \nof  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives,  will  relend  the  loan  to  BML  and  enter  into  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement  with  BML.  MOFT  will  advance  the  LCF  funds  to  BML  semiannually  based  on  the \nprojected loan processing amount over the next 6 months. The Government has indicated that \nthe loan term (Government to BML) will not exceed 24 years, including a 3-year grace period, \nwith the Government retaining the right to close the LCF. The LCF loan will be disbursed over 3 \nyears, subject to a midterm review after 18 months to review disbursement progress and refine \nthe arrangements as needed.  \n \n3. \nOnlending  Loan  Size  and  Costs.  BML  will  undertake  an  independent  credit  risk \nassessment analysis for proposals to determine if they meet the lending criteria agreed among \nthe Government, ADB, and BML2. If the credit risk assessment is satisfactory, BML will approve \nthe  subloan  and  execute  an  onlending  agreement.  Onlending  agreements  will  be  signed \nbetween BML and the subborrower on terms and conditions, as agreed among the Government, \nADB,  and  BML.  BML  will  submit  a  report  on  approved  subloans  and  a  copy  of  onlending \nagreements to MOFT. The maximum subloan size for individual applicants will be Rf1,024,000 \n($80,000) and the anticipated average subloan size is Rf512,000 ($40,000). It is expected that \nBML will provide around 70 MSMEs with subloans under LCF. Any deviation will be subject to \nADB\u2019s  prior  approval.  The  terms  of  lending  will  be  on  a  commercial  basis  at  the  prevailing \nmarket rates of interest and tenor, reflecting costs of raising such funds locally and guaranteeing \nadequate spread of interest rates for BML to cover transaction costs and risks. The subborrower \nwill  be  required  to  pay  an  upfront  processing  fee 3  as  per  the  current  processing  fee \nrequirements  being  followed  by  BML.  Subborrowers  will  have  to  provide  any  assets  acquired \nwith  the  credit  line  subloan  as  collaterals.  The  grace  period  and  a  maximum  maturity  will  be \ndecided based on the reasonable assessment of amount and maturity of credit demand by the \ntargeted  MSME  at  the  initial  stage  of  implementation.4 Implementation  of  the  scheme  will  be \n\n                                                 \n1  About 1,000 MSMEs from two targeted regions are registered with the EDU MSME database. \n2    Development  Banking  Cell  (DBC)  within  BML  has  experience  of  conducting  credit  analysis  under  other \ndevelopment  projects  provided  by  ADB  and  other  donors  (Please  see  Supplementary  Appendix  C:  Bank  of \nMaldives Due Diligence). \n\n3   In the Maldives, the \u2019upfront processing fee\u2019 is considered to be as a \u2019guarantee fee.\u2019 The guarantee fee will cover \n\nthe cost of application processing as well as discourage non-serious applications.    \n\n4  Detailed LCF onlending commercial terms and manuals are to be reviewed as part of ADB TA 4745. ADB. 2005. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Small and Medium Enterprise Development. Manila (TA \n4745-MLD, approved on 19 December, for $600,000). \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nbased on a selective approach in which subloans are extended on a case-by-case basis. BML \nwill  lend  from  the  LCF  on  less  restrictive  collateral  requirements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  incorporated  in  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  BML  and \nthe Government. \n \n4. \nOnlending  Default  Coverage.  To  provide  BML  with  an  incentive  for  onlending  to \nMSMEs in designated local atolls with less restrictive collateral, which is the core of the Project \nin  line  with  the  purpose  of  the  loan  under  the  LCF,  the  Government  will  provide  BML  with  an \n80%  guarantee  for  defaulted  subloans.  BML  will  bear  the  remaining  risk  to  ensure  that  MBL \ncontinues  to  be  diligent  in  its  onlending  activities.  BML  and  the  Government  will  agree  on  the \nlength of time after which the subloan is considered to be in default; this will be documented in \nthe relevant onlending agreement. The default rate will be a prime determinant of the scheme\u2019s \nviability. A default rate between 2% and 3% should be targeted; the maximum acceptable rate \nshould be 6%. \n \n5. \nOnlending  Procedures.  The  business  development  services  centers  (BDSCs)  will \nassist  the  subborrower  in  preparing  the  subloan  applications  and  forward  them  to  BML  with \nbusiness plans and financial requirement information submitted by or consulted with the MSME \napplicant.  Upon  receipt  of  these  documents,  BML  will  undertake  an  independent  credit  risk \nassessment  analysis  to  determine  whether  it  meets  the  lending  criteria  agreed  among  the \nGovernment, ADB, and BML. Upon completion of scrutiny, BML will decide whether to approve \nthe subloan. If approved, BML will execute an onlending agreement with the subborrower and \nsubmit  a  report  on  approved  subloans  and  a  copy  of  onlending  agreements  to  MOFT.  The \ndisbursement of the subloan will be made with reference to the BDSCs. Time limits for BML to \nundertake the credit risk assessment will be agreed upon at the time of finalizing the operating \nprocedures  for  the  LCF.  EDU  in  coordination  with  the  BDSCs  will  be  responsible  for \nencouraging use of the LCF.  \n \nProposed  Pilot  Operation  and  Targeted  Subloans.  Technical  assistance \n6. \nconsultancies  will  be  provided  to  BML  and  EDU  at  the  initial  stage  of  loan  implementation  to \ndevelop  and  detail  LCF  operating  procedures.  The  pilot  phase  will  focus  on  institutional \norganization  and  staffing,  capacity  development,  and  implementation  of  a  pilot  LCF  of  $3.0 \nmillion  to  provide  about  70  subloans.  Depending  on  outcomes  of  the  LCF  pilot  operation,  the \nsecond phase will establish regular LCF operation with a further fund contribution.5 The first two \nsubloans during the pilot operation will be referred to ADB for its prior monitoring and review. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n5   The assumption is that if BML becomes competent by this period, then it will introduce a credit guarantee product \nin the near future. During the regular operation, the number of credit lines  will be dependent on loan recoveries, \nany further capitalization of the fund, and acceptable leverage by BML. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n43\n\nItem \n\nFund size ($) \nMaximum subloan (Rf) \nAverage subloan (Rf) \nLoan target(Number by the \nend of period) \nUpfront fee from borrower \n(%) \nDefault coverage (%) \n\nTable A6: Line of Credit Facility \n\nPhase I: Pilot Operation  \nFY2008\u2013FY2011 \n3,000,000 \n1,024,000 \n512,000 \n\nAbout 70 subloans \n\nPlanned Phase II: Regular \nOperations FY2011 Onward \nAdditional Funda \n1,024,000 \n512,000 \nBased on loan recoveries and \navailable capital \n\n1.5% of the subloan size \n\n1.5% of the subloan size \n\n80% by the Government \n\nBased on loan recoveries and lessons\n\na    A  phase  II  project  is  scheduled  to  be  processed  during  2009\u20132010.

BML  will  conduct  its  business  in  accordance  with  sound \nbanking,  administrative,  financial,  environmental,  and  business  practices.  BML  will  notify  ADB \nand  afford  ADB  adequate  opportunity  to  comment  prior  to  (i)  selling,  leasing,  transferring,  or \notherwise  disposing  of  any  of  its  assets,  except  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its  business;  or  (ii) \nestablishing or acquiring any subsidiary. \n \nInstitutional  Strengthening  and  Capacity  Development  Support  to  BML.  Capacity \n8. \nbuilding will facilitate BML administration of the LCF. BML will provide office infrastructure and \nequipment  to  the  LCF,  thus  ensuring  that  the  fund  capital  can  be  fully  utilized  for  credit  line \nsubloans. In contrast to creating a new LCF institution, its placement as a division of BML offers \nthe following advantages: (i) the LCF can use existing facilities (BML head office and branches \nin  outer  atoll  islands),  and  possibly  draw  on  existing  staff  and  institutional  capacities  such  as \nsecretarial  support,  accounting,  and  product  advertisement;  (ii)  career  development  will  be \nenhanced,  thereby  making  the  LCF  attractive  to  well-qualified  staff;  and  (iii)  mutual  synergies \nwill  exist  between  BML  and  the  businesses,  such  as  extending  the  range  of  collateral-based \nlending, based on lessons from the pilot operation.  \n \n9. \nTechnical assistance will be provided to BML for developing and detailing the operating \nprocedures of the LCF. An LCF manager will form an LCF desk within BML. Even though the \nLCF subloans are for clients in the outer atolls in the northern and southern regions, the facility \nwill  be  domiciled  in  the  head  office  of  BML  in  Mal\u00e9,  which  is  geographically  situated  in  the \ncenter  of  the  country.  Moreover,  the  advantages  of  establishing  the  LCF  as  a  BML  desk  can \nbest be realized if the LCF operations are located within BML\u2019s head office. Moreover, based on \nthe experiences of the Project and the capacity built within BML, BML would be able to continue \nfacility  operations  as  a  credit  guarantee  facility,  a  new  product  offering,  beyond  the  Project \nperiod. \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nPROCUREMENT PLAN \n\nA. \n\nProject Information \n\nCountry \nName of borrower \nProject name \nLoan or technical assistance reference \nDate of effectiveness \nAmount $ (total from all financiers): \nExecuting agency \nApproval date of original procurement plan \nApproval of most recent procurement plan \nPublication for local advertisementa \nPeriod covered by this plan \n\nRepublic of the Maldives \nRepublic of the Maldives \nPrivate Sector Development Project \nTbd \nTargeted for August 2008 \n$7.5 million \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury \nTbd \nTbd \nTbd \n2008\u20132011 \n\na General procurement notice, invitations to prequalify and bid, calls for expressions of interest. \n \nB. \n\nProcurement Thresholds for Goods and Related Services, Works and Supply, and \nInstallation \n\nThresholds \n\nEqual to and more than $0.5 million \nLess than $0.5 million \nLess than $0.1 million \n\nProcurement Thresholds for Consultants Services \n\nProcurement Methods \nInternational competitiveness bidding goods \nNational competitiveness bidding goods \nShopping goods \n \nC. \nProcurement Methods \nQuality-based selection  \n \nQuality- and cost-based selection \n \nAlternative methods \nFTP = full technical proposal, STP = simplified technical proposal. \n \nD. \n\nThresholds ($) \n\nFTP: Over $1.0 million \nSTP: Over $0.3 million and no more than $1.0 million \nFTP: Over $1.0 million \nSTP: Over $0.3 million and no more than $1.0 million \nIndividual consultant selection, direct contracting \n\nList of Contract Packages in Excess of $10,000 for Goods, Works, and Consulting \nServices \n\nEstimated \nCost \n($\u2019000) \n\nProcurement \nMethod \n\nExpected \nDate of \nAdvertisement \n\nPrior \nReview \n\nContract \nDescription \n\nContract 1 (Component A): \nConsultancy and training on \nBDSC and capacity \ndevelopment \nContract 2 (Component B): \nConsultancy and training on \nCMAR, and LCF \nContract 3 (Component B):  \nTurnkey consultancy package \nincluding hardware and \nsoftware for CIB, training as \nwell as the first year operating \ncosta \nContract 4 (Component C): \nConsultancy and training on \nPPP enabling framework \nContract 5 (Component C): \nConsultancy and training \n\n \n\n725 \n\n170 \n\n540 \n\n480 \n\n820 \n\nQCBS with \nSTP \n\nIndividual \nconsultant \nselection \n\nQCBS with \nFTP \n\nQCBS with \nSTP \n\nQCBS with \nSTP \n\n2008Q3 \n\nYes \n\n2008Q3 \n\nYes \n\nComments \n\nFinanced by \nADB \n\nFinanced by \nADB \n\n2008Q2 \n\nYes \n\nFinanced by \nADB \n\n2008Q3 \n\nYes \n\n2008Q3 \n\nYes \n\nFinanced by \nADB \n\nFinanced by \nADB \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n45\n\nContract \nDescription \n\non developing PPP projects \n\nEstimated \nCost \n($\u2019000) \n\nProcurement \nMethod \n\nExpected \nDate of \nAdvertisement \n\nPrior \nReview \n\nComments \n\n60 \n\n10 \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\n2008Q3 \n\n2008Q3 \n\nShopping \n\nShopping \n\nFinanced by \nADB \n\nFinanced by \nthe \nGovernment\n\nContract 6: Procurement of \ncomputers \nContract 7: Procurement of \ncomputers, printers, \nphotocopiers, and other related \nfacilities \nADB = Asian Development Bank; BDSC = business development services center; BML = Bank of Maldives; CIB = credit \ninformation bureau; CMAR = central moveable asset registry; FTP = full technical proposal; LCF = line of credit facility; \nPPP = public\u2013private partnership; QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; STP = simplified technical proposal. \na The credit bureau implementation and operations should require a combination of proprietary skills and experience in \nthe  areas  of  (i)  consumer  finance  and  banking  in  general,  (ii)  credit  reporting  and  financial  industry  legislation  on  a \nlocal  and  worldwide  basis,  (iii)  personal  data  security,  consumer  protection  and  other  legal  compliance,  (iv)  public \nrelations  and  media  coverage,  crisis  management,  (v)  data  processing  management,  (vi)  operational  support  of  the \ncredit bureau, (vii) documentation and training support, (viii) overall corporate managerial capabilities, (ix) information \ntechnology  project  management,  (x)  software  development  and  maintenance,  and  (xi)  provision  of  continuous \nevolution of solutions as technologies and business needs change.

This summary assessment covers (i) relevant issues in \nprivate  sector  development,  (ii)  relevant  risk  analysis,  including  specification  of  (a)  underlying \nassumptions in the risk analysis; (b) various potential risks in the Project and parties who bears \nthem;  (c)  perceived  severity  of  the  risks;  (d)  review  of  ongoing  and  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures to address the risks; and (e) residual risks, if any; and (iii) recommendations on how \nthe assessment findings can be incorporated in the project design.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  dominates  the  economy  in  the  Maldives;  most  of  the  key  business \nactivities  are  carried  out  by  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  The  policy  environment  has  not \nbeen conducive to the development of the private sector. Government ownership, whether full \nor  partial,  is  still  widespread  in  every  sector  except  tourism.  In  addition,  the  Government  has \nhad  little  experiences  with  PPP  through  build-own-operate  and  build-own-operate-transfer \nmechanisms. The share of the gross domestic product (GDP) absorbed by government output \nincreased from 8.4% of GDP in 1984 to 12.4% in 2004, as civil service employment increased \nfivefold in 20 years. \n \nSOEs play an important role in the economy given that most large enterprises are in the \n3. \npublic  sector.  They  currently  dominate  almost  all  significant  sectors  (such  as  civil  aviation, \nfinancial services, fisheries, public utilities, and telecommunications). Concerns about the limited \ncapacity  of  the  private  sector,  possibility  of  private  monopolies  due  to  the  small  size  of  the \ndomestic market, and the desire to benefit potential scale economies in production have been \namong the factors that explain the Maldives\u2019 sizable SOE sector. \n \n4. \nThe  Government  recently  indicated  its  full  commitment  to  SOE  restructuring  and \nprivatization.  This  comes  as  the  Government  increasingly  recognizes  that  with  increased \nparticipation of the private sector in the economy, the rationale for retaining public ownership of \ncompanies  is  weakening.  Moreover,  recommended  business  profit  tax  would  provide  a \nreplacement for the dividends currently being received from profit-making SOEs. \n \n5. \nWhile the foundations or architecture for implementing a privatization strategy need to be \nestablished, the Government has adopted a parallel course of action to move forward with the \nprivatization  agenda.  This  comprises  developing  the  foundations  for  privatization  while \nsimultaneously  privatizing  priority  SOEs  and  other  actions  such  as  divesting  shares  of  the \nHousing  Finance  Corporation  to  multilateral  financial  institutions.  This  is  to  be  followed  by  the \nadoption  of  a  privatization  law.  The  Public  Enterprise  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Board  will \nsimultaneously require upgrading to become the nodal agency in the Government responsible \nfor  implementing  SOE  privatization  and  restructuring.  The  board  currently  has  five  staff;  the \nGovernment will need to strengthen its capacity. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The main underlying assumptions made in this risk analysis \nare that (i) consensus is considerable on the need for reforms to address structural constraints, \nand  the  Government  will  continue  political  and  economic  reforms;  (ii)  the  Government  must \nurgently  strengthen  the  private  sector  if  the  country  is  to  increase  its  growth  rate;  and  \n(iii) effective institutional building in key institutions will proceed as currently planned.  \n \n8. \n(Table A11.1). \n\nRisk Specification.

STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project encourages market-based strategies and actively promotes competition, innovation, and resilient PPPs. \nTo  foster  greater  private  sector  participation  in  line  with  the  7th  National  Development  Plan,  the  Project  envisages \nthe Government and the private sector working as partners to improve corporate governance and transparency, and \nmaximizes  the  potential  of  PPPs  with  a  view  to  providing  opportunities  for  MSMEs  to  participate  in  a  more \ncompetitive environment. The Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s CPS 2007\u20132011.a The CPS identifies key indicators \nincluding business model development linked to the markets, with enhanced access to financing and improved PPP \ndevelopment. Once readiness is secured, ADB\u2019s second phase of assistance would include support for investment \nprojects to leverage institutional strengthening measures already in place.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.    Key  Issues.  In  2004,  the  Government  conducted  a  second  vulnerability  and  poverty  assessmentb  (VPA2) \ncovering the households on 200 inhabited islands. During 1997\u20132004, the Maldives made impressive progress in its \nsocioeconomic  development  with  per  capita  household  income  in  the  atolls  increasing  by  about  50%.  A  significant \nreduction  in  poverty  was  achieved  everywhere  in  the  region  with  the  percentage  of  people  having  less  than  Rf10 \n(around $1) per day decreasing from 20% in 1997 to 10% in 2004. Similarly in 1997, 60% of the population had less \nthan  Rf20  and,  in  2004,  35%.  Nonetheless,  income  distribution  remains  unequal  especially  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the \natolls. Given the relation between economic activity and geographic dispersion for Mal\u00e9 between 1997 and 2004 the \ngini coefficient actually rose from 0.12 to 0.18. With respect to access to basic public services, the VPA2 notes that \naccess to educational services for the population living in the atolls increased quite substantially. In 2004, two thirds \nof the people living on islands were offered education up to grade 10 compared to one fourth in 1997. Since 1997, \ninfant mortality has decreased, while life expectancy has improved from 62 to 68. Over the last few years, constraints \non  physical  infrastructure  have  improved,  and  now  24-hour  electricity  supply  is  available  to  nearly  all  islands.  The \nbuilding  of  new  harbors  and  jetties  has  resulted  in  two  thirds  of  the  island  population  always  being  accessible  by \nboat. The situation for women in the Maldives is continuously improving. They have achieved parity in both primary \nand secondary education. Progress has also been made in meeting nutritional requirements.  \n \nIn 2002, the Government and the ADB signed a poverty reduction partnership agreement defining a long-term vision \nfor  poverty  reduction.  It  sets  out  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  priorities  and  targets  to  monitor  progress. \nInnovations  in  governance  and  fiscal  consolidation  are  among  the  key  instruments  envisaged  in  the  agreement  to \nreduce poverty incidence and to expand access to economic infrastructure and quality social services in the atolls.  \n \n2.  Design  Features. The Project  will contribute to poverty reduction in general in the Maldives in several aspects. \nFirst,  it  is  expected  to  contribute  to  an  improved  business  environment  for  MSMEs  with  enhanced  institutional \ncapacity  and  financial  services  outreach,  improved  access  to  credit  by  MSMEs  through  better  use  of  credit \ninformation, and increased BDS for enterprises to access training, consulting, and marketing and information. Given \nthe targeted enterprises are located in the northern and southern regions with equal to or less than 50 employees, \nthe Project is expected to increase business activities and employment ratio and contribute to income generation in \nthese remote regions. Second, the Project will assist the Maldives in developing and delivering critical infrastructure \nand  services  projects  through  private  investment,  thereby  reducing  government\u2019s  financial  burden,  and  enhancing \nprivate  sector  participation  and  business  expansion  by  MSME.  The  PPP  will  induce  private  sector  investment  into \nsocial infrastructure, including power generators, transportation, water treatment facilities, and to their operation and \nmaintenance.  Third,  capacity  development  initiatives  under  the  Project  will  facilitate  the  operations  of  these  reform \ninitiatives,  and  provide  long-term  sustainability  over  and  beyond  the  Project  period  which  would  be  essential  to \nensure  that  the  expected  benefits  in  terms  of  poverty  reduction  are  efficiently  and  effectively  achieved  and \ndistributed.   \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  private  sector  in  the  Maldives  has  a  dualistic  structure.  Ninety  percent  of  firms  are  indigenous  that  are  either \nowner-operated or microenterprises with fewer than three employees. At the other end of the spectrum are a large \nnumber of foreign direct investors, principally involved in the management of tourist resorts and public utilities. The \nMSMEs are confronted with major obstacles such as high costs and limited access to finance, lack of skilled labor, \nasymmetries of market information and business related expertise, poorly developed interisland transportation, and \nhigh  cost  of  power  generation.  Moreover,  according  to  the  2006  census,  8.3%  of  the  adult  population  is  unable  to \nfind  suitable  employment  or  lacks  employment  opportunities.  Under  the  7th  National  Development  Plan,  the \nGovernment  provides  specific  guidelines  on  its  strategies  to  increase  employment  opportunities.  They  include  the \npreparation  of  human  resource  needs  assessment,  training  and  capacity  building  of  atoll  laborers,  and  a  labor \nmarket  information  system.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  developing  the  private  sector  by  promoting  business \npractices; enhancing access to financing; developing linkages between domestic and international private sectors to \nshare knowledge, expertise, and technology; as well as supporting training and capacity building of entrepreneurs in \nremote atolls. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nUnder the Project, public awareness seminars and campaigns will be undertaken to introduce BDS, the cost-sharing \nfacility, the line of credit facility; and a credit information bureau registry. Moreover, key stakeholder seminars will be \narranged to develop and deliver critical infrastructure and services through PPP. Following project implementation, \nconcerted efforts will be made to disseminate lessons and major outcomes, which will be used to design and develop \na project on MSME development, scheduled to be processed in 2009-2010.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nDuring  project  implementation,  an  environment  and  social  expert  (an  international  consultant)  will  review  current \nenvironmental and social guidelines and provide appropriate inputs and consultation to mitigate any adverse impact \nof project implementation. A budget has been allocated to recruit an international consultant for 2 person-months.  \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.
