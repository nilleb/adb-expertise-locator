Although the electrification rate in Kazakhstan \nis very high (97%), the system losses are high (estimated to be 16% nationally) and inventory \nmanagement  of  spare  parts  is  becoming  an  increasing  problem  as  the  assets  become  more \noutdated.  Investments  in  the  system  are  falling  short  in  the  face  of  increasing  demand,  which \nhas  been  growing  by  approximately  6%  annually  since  2000.  Given  the  harsh  climate, \nparticularly  during  winter,  it  is  of  critical  and  immediate  importance  to  upgrade  the  old \ntransmission and distribution networks to avoid system breakdowns which could be harmful to \nthe economy and even fatal to end users.  \n \nIn late 2011, the Private Sector Operations Department of the Asian Development Bank \n3. \n(ADB)  explored  investment  opportunities  in  potential  high  development  impact  areas,  mainly \nelectricity transmission and distribution. Among several private sector power groups, CAEPCO \nwas  identified  as  the  largest  privately  owned,  vertically  integrated  power  utility  in  Kazakhstan \nwith  a  good  financial  and  technical  track  record.  In  early  2012,  CAEPCO  applied  for  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  to  fund  its  expansion  plans  in  relation  to  AEDC.  From  those  initial  discussions, \nADB\u2019s  project \nthat  ADB  participation  would  bring  significant \ndevelopmental benefits. The loan would also be ADB\u2019s first in the energy sector in Kazakhstan. \n \n\nteam  came \n\nto  believe \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nAEDC\u2019s  capital  investment  program  for  2013\u20132015  will  expand,  augment,  and \n\n4. \nmodernize the company\u2019s distribution network under the new ownership of CAEPCO. \n \n5. \nAEDC aims to expand its network capacity to improve reliability of electricity supply, and \nto  maintain  low  electricity  losses  by  investing  in  new  and  reconstructed  distribution  lines  and \nmodernized substations. The aim of the project is to increase reliable power supply to existing \nresidential and commercial clients (indirectly through sales companies) and particularly increase \nconnection  to  35,000  additional  households  by  2020  in  rural  areas  of  Akmola  province  and \nAstana.  This  will  be  achieved  by  (i) reconstructing,  repairing,  and  adding  new  capacity  to  the \nfixed  assets,  such  as  substations  and  distribution  lines;  (ii) upgrading  software  systems  for \npower  accounting;  and  (iii) acquiring  modern  measuring  devices.  The  project  also  aims  to \n(i) enable  increased  equipment  load  to  reduce  energy  losses  in  networks  of  different  voltage, \n(ii) reduce direct expenses related to maintenance of equipment, (iii) add capacity in areas with \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f 2\n\nintensive  infrastructure  development,  and  (iv) create  modern  automated  measurement  and \ntechnological monitoring systems to improve operational and administrative efficiency. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrowers and Sponsor \n\n6. \nAEDC  became  a  joint  stock  company  on  8  March  2004  but  has  been  in  operation  in \ndifferent  legal  forms  since  1961.  It  is  the  local  electricity  distribution  company  principally \noperating  within  the  boundaries  of  Akmola  province  and  in  a  small  area  of  Astana,  which \nborders  Akmola  province  to  the  south.  The  company,  through  its  electricity  sales  subsidiary, \nserves  116,000  end  users  in  14  districts  of  Akmola  province  and  181,000  in  Astana  and \nStepnogorsk. These end users are serviced through 25 direct power purchasers in the electricity \ndistribution, agriculture, industry, and residential sectors. The total length of AEDC\u2019s electricity \ndistribution  network  is  21,500  kilometers  (km)  with  voltages  from  0.4  kilovolts  (kV)  to  110  kV, \napproximately 2,700 transformers, and 3,500 substations. Since 2003, the company has never \nrecorded an operating loss, and its current technical loss is approximately 4%,2 which is one of \nthe lowest in Kazakhstan.  \n \n7. \nMost of AEDC\u2019s assets are old and have been largely depreciated. No major investment \nplan has been approved, and the tariff has been kept low for wider social reasons. However, the \ngovernment  acknowledged  that  tariffs  need  to  increase  to  allow  power  companies  to  invest \nmore to improve reliability and efficiency. Against this background, AEDC\u2019s tariff was increased \nby 82.5% in 2011 and 14.7% in 2013. \n \n8. \nCAEPCO  covers  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  heat  and  electricity  in \nPavlodar, North Kazakhstan province, and in Astana. CAEPCO, through its subsidiaries, owns \nfour  thermal  power  plants  with  a  total  installed  generating  capacity  of  974  megawatts  and \nheating generation capacity of 2.871 gigacalories per hour. It also owns 51,349 km of electricity \ndistribution  networks  and  986  km  of  district  heating  networks.  The  company  generates \napproximately  7%  of  the  total  electricity  in  Kazakhstan  and  serves  around  692,000  electricity \nend users and 401,000 heat consumers. \n \n9. \nCAEPCO\u2019s  controlling  shareholder  (62.12%)  is  Central-Asian  Power  Energy  Company \n(CAPEC),  a  private  holding  company  incorporated  and  registered  in  Kazakhstan  with  an  A \nrating from Expert RA Kazakhstan.3 The other shareholders of CAEPCO are the European Bank \nfor  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  (24.99%)  and  the  Islamic  Infrastructure  Fund \n(12.89%), which was cofounded by ADB and the Islamic Development Bank. CAPEC is owned \nby several well-known local businesspeople. Most of its revenues are derived from the energy \nsector,  i.e.,  CAEPCO  and  AEDC,  while  it  holds  minority  stakes  in  a  few  finance  sector \ncompanies. In FY2012, CAPEC\u2019s total assets were approximately $1.2 billion, total revenue was \n$562.0  million,  and  net  profit  from  operations  was  $43.5  million,  an  increase  from  the  $30.3 \nmillion in FY2011 because of higher revenues from electricity transmission and sales. \n \n10.  While CAEPCO is a vertically integrated power utility company with several distribution \nsubsidiaries, approximately 83% of its revenues come from generation of electricity (60%) and \nheat  (23%),  and  the  remainder  comes  from  transmission  and  distribution  services.  In  June \n2013,  Fitch  assigned  a  rating  of  BB\u2013  to  CAEPCO,  reflecting  strengths  based  on  its  vertical \nintegration, relatively benign regulatory regime, access to cheap coal, and good regional market \n                                                 \n2   This corresponds to the loss of approximately 118 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2012. \n3  Expert RA is the largest rating agency in Russia and operates in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates. The rating scale ranks from A++ (Absolute highest creditworthiness) to D (Default or Bankruptcy), where A \nrepresents high creditworthiness. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nposition,  as  well  as  a  concern  over  potential  pressure  on  its  cash  flow  from  the  planned \ninvestment program to modernize its aging assets.

The  project  is  expected  to  be  complemented  by  more  capital  investment  in \nthe  country\u2019s  transmission  and  distribution  network  to  expand  capacity  and  improve  efficiency \nand reliability. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nAn expanded and more efficient power supply is expected by AEDC in Akmola province \n12. \nand  Astana  through  improved  distribution  infrastructure.  Additional  power  will  be  supplied  and \nnetwork  failure  and  technical  loss  caused  by  obsolete  infrastructure  will  be  prevented  through \nadequate upgrading and replacement as well as repair and maintenance of the facilities. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n13.   Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  rehabilitate  and  augment  19  substations, \n60.0 km of 110 kV lines, 142.8 km of 10 kV lines, and 52.0 km of 0.4 kV lines. Further, it will add \none  new  substation,  141  km  of  35  kV  lines,  102  km  of  110  kV  lines,  and  two  transformers  to \nAEDC\u2019s distribution network, as well as additional metering devices to improve the automated \nsystem for commercial power balancing and settlements. \n \n\n \n \n\n\f 4\n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  which  promotes  private  sector \n14. \ninvestment  in  the  infrastructure  sector.4 Strategy  2020  also  outlines  the  need  for  ADB  to  help \naddress growing energy demand and assist in expanding infrastructure for energy supply. \n \nThe  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  Kazakhstan  seeks  to  increase  ADB\u2019s \n15. \ninvolvement  in  the  energy  sector,  with  the  aim  of  modernizing  the  country\u2019s  aging  energy \ninfrastructure. 5  It  notes  specifically  that  ADB  will  support  replacement  of  obsolete  energy \ninfrastructure and technologies, and upgrade the transmission network, mainly through private \nsector  or  subsovereign  modalities.  The  project  is  therefore  fully  aligned  with  the  country \npartnership strategy. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n16. \nThe  project  is  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  which  highlights  energy  efficiency \nimprovements  in  transmission  and  distribution  systems.6 Under  the  policy,  it  is  proposed  that \nADB will continue to support installation of modern transmissions systems to transmit electricity \nefficiently  from  generation  facilities  to  consumers,  including  upgrading  existing  systems  to \nreduce technical losses and enabling competition when open access is permitted by law. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\n17. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nAEDC\u2019s investment \nplan \n\nRevenue structure \n\nArrangements \nAEDC  and  CAEPCO  operate  under  the  general  regulatory  framework \napplicable to power utility companies in Kazakhstan. The tariffs are set by the \nAgency for Regulation of Natural Monopoly. \nAEDC\u2019s board of directors consists of three members. CAPEC nominates two \nmembers  (including  the  chair)  and  one  member  is  an  independent  director. \nAEDC\u2019s  management  board  consists  of  five  members.  They  are  experienced \nand technically competent professionals. \n \nCAEPCO\u2019s  board  of  directors  consists  of  eight  members.  CAPEC  nominates \nthree  members  (including  the  chair),  the  EBRD  and  IIF  nominate  one  each, \nand three are independent directors. CAEPCO\u2019s management is led by Yerkyn \nAmirkhanov, president of CAEPCO. \n2013\u20132015 \nAEDC  will  follow  a  national  procurement  rule  for  natural  monopoly  in \nKazakhstan. Competitive tendering procedure is required for purchases of T3 \nmillion or more. CAEPCO will provide support to the tendering process. \nAEDC\u2019s  supply  contracts  are  effective  for  1  year  and  renewed  annually. \nAEDC\u2019s revenue is based on the approved tariff with actual supply volume. \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2008.

This transaction is \nconsidered as general corporate finance in terms of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \ntherefore a corporate audit of current operations of CAEPCO and AEDC and implementation of \nAEDC\u2019s proposed investment has been conducted. The audit finds no outstanding compliance \nissues related to existing operations. The current environmental assessment practice including \nmanagement  of  environmental,  health,  and  safety  activities  is  based  on  national  requirements \nand  the  environmental  and  social  action  plan  was  established  with  support  of  the  EBRD.  The \nenvironmental  and  social  action  plan  covers  measures  to  implement,  manage,  and  monitor \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f 6\n\nproject  impacts  and  risks  to  ensure  compliance  with  local  regulation  and  appropriate  budget \nallocation for monitoring activities. Information disclosure, consultations with stakeholders, and \nsubmission  of  monitoring  reports  are  conducted  as  required  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s  legislation.  The \ncurrent institutional capacity and commitment of CAEPCO and AEDC to manage environmental, \nhealth  and  safety  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  However,  procedures  for  screening  and \ncategorizing  environmental  impacts  and  risks  need  to  be  integrated  into  the  new  ESMS  to \ncomply with ADB policy requirements. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \n21. \nindigenous  peoples.  The  audit  finds  that  the  land  used  by  AEDC  is  either  owned  by  the \ncompany or leased from the state for 49 years in accordance with Kazakhstan\u2019s legislation. The \ninvestment program activities are envisaged to be carried out on land already owned and leased \nby  AEDC.  The  requirement  for  new  land  acquisition  or  lease  for  the  replacement  of  the  aerial \ndistribution  lines  with  underground  cable  in  Astana  city  can  be  ascertained  only  after  the \ntechnical  design  is  finalized.  If  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  will  occur,  the \nrequired  procedures  for  screening  and  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  should  be  developed  in \naccordance with Safeguard Requirements 2: Involuntary Resettlement of the Safeguard Policy \nStatement.  The  audit  also  noted  that  there  are  88  ethnic  groups  residing  in  Akmola  province, \nwhere Kazakhs are the largest permanent population followed by Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, \nand  Belorussians,  among  others.  All  nationalities  are  fully  integrated  into  Kazakh  society,  and \ntherefore  they  are  not  considered  indigenous  peoples  as  per  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. \nMoreover,  procedures  and  policy  for  screening and  categorization  of social  risks  and  impacts, \nland  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  need  to  be  integrated  into  the  new \nESMS to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n22. \nCAEPCO\u2019s commitment to establish a new ESMS and apply it to AEDC as a condition of \nADB\u2019s  investment  was  noted.  CAEPCO  and  AEDC  also  committed  to  engage  adequate \nenvironmental  and  social  staff  and  arrange  periodic  corporate  and  site  training  for  them.  The \ncompanies  will  strengthen  their  procedures  for  meaningful  consultation  and  information \ndisclosure, grievance redress, monitoring, and reporting. The companies will also prepare audit \nreports  and  corrective  action  plans  or  environmental  and  social  plans  for  existing  facilities. \nCAEPCO and AEDC will submit semi-annual reports to ADB on the implementation status of the \nESMS, including implementation of corrective actions indicated in the audit report. \n \n23. \nOther social dimensions. The project is classified as having no gender elements. It will \nbenefit  the  population  of  Akmola  through  a  more  reliable  supply  of  electricity.  Moreover,  the \nnature  of  employment  during  construction  activities  does  not  lead  to  many  opportunities  for \nwomen.  Employment  opportunities  at  the  operations  phase  will  be  open  to  interested  and \nqualified men and women. ADB will ensure that the ESMS includes appropriate arrangements \nrequiring  CAEPCO  and  AEDC  (including  contractors)  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and \ntake  measures  to  conform  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards  for  the  ADB-\nfinanced portion of the project, in compliance with ADB's Social Protection Strategy.7 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Anti-Money-Laundering Policies \n\n24. \nCAEPCO and AEDC were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  and  Policy  on  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will \nrequire  AEDC  and  CAEPCO  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and \n\n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001. Social Protection Strategy. Manila \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, \nmoney-laundering activities, and the financing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  loans  are  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n25. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n26. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADB  will \nconfirm with the Government of Kazakhstan if it has an objection to the proposed assistance to \nAEDC and CAEPCO. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n27. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loans of up to \n$40,000,000  to  the  Akmola  Electricity  Distribution  Company  and  the  Central-Asian  Electric \nPower Corporation for the Akmola Electricity Distribution Network Modernization and Expansion
