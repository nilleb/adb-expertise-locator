I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the High Mountain Agribusiness and Livelihood Improvement (HIMALI) Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  assist  farmers  and  downstream  enterprises  to  strengthen  linkages, \ntaking advantage of the gradual improvement in infrastructure, to realize the existing demand for \nmountain products. A demand-driven approach will be used to (i) mobilize interested producer \ngroups; (ii) provide support for quality improvement, value adding, and product aggregation into \nquantities  of  scale  sufficient  to  attract  demand-side  business;  (iii) stimulate  private  sector \nagribusiness development; and (iv) reduce risk exposure to businesses investing in the high \nmountain districts. Project grants will be provided to eligible entities for implementing viable \nagribusiness plans that demonstrate income and employment benefits in the project districts. \nThe  private  sector  has  expressed  interest  in  a  range  of  suitable  business  development, \nincluding (i) organized production of high-value products through contract or supply agreements; \n(ii) established collection, post-harvest quality grading, and storage facilities; (iii) processing and \nvalue adding; and (iv) quality certification to access high-value markets.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  About 80% of Nepal\u2019s population lives in rural areas that have been left behind national \neconomic growth. The high mountain areas are the least-developed among rural areas, mainly \nbecause  of  limited  access  to  markets  and  lack  of  investments.  These  areas  are  highly \nsusceptible to the impact of climate change, for which Nepal is one of the most vulnerable \ncountries in Asia. Nepal recently became a net food importer, partly because of lack of growth in \nagriculture, despite it employing 66% of the population and contributing about 35% to the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product. The growth of the agriculture sector has been erratic largely \nbecause of its continued dependence on rainfall for irrigation and the dominance of cereal crop \nproduction\u2014growth averaged only 2.5% in the past 5 years (FY2006\u2013FY2010).3 Ten project \ndistricts4 were selected based on selection criteria including food insecurity5 (over 60% of the \nproject district population is malnourished) and high incidence of poverty (over 60%).6 This is \nsignificantly greater than the country\u2019s overall income poverty incidence rate of 31% and urban \npoverty  rate  of  10%. These  trends  also reflect  the  vulnerability  of  mountain  agriculture  to \nweather and geophysical conditions as well as infrastructural constraints.  \n \n4.  The  widening  gap  between  rich  and  poor  regions  has  added  to  social  tensions, \ncontributed to conflict in the past, and continued to pressure the government for solutions. \nOvergrazing and exploitation of forest and wild medicinal plants have degraded community \nlivelihood assets and weakened resilience to climate change. Despite the significant contribution \nof agriculture to the economy, the sector\u2019s performance is constrained by farmers\u2019 limited \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2009.

More than 1 million Nepalese \nemigrate for employment abroad, resulting in seasonal households headed by women and \nfeminization of agricultural labor. However, promising opportunities exist for the agriculture \nsector in value addition, marketing efficiency, reducing postharvest losses, and sustainable \nforest and rangeland production. \n \n5.  The project design is intended to contribute to the achievement of government and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  development  outcomes,  reflecting  the  new  political  realities  and \neconomic strategies of Nepal. Reflecting the lessons learned and recommendations in the \nCountry Assistance Program Evaluation for the Country Strategy and Program 2005\u20132009,7 the \nADB country partnership strategy 2010\u20132012 identifies the development outcomes as improved \nfood security, rural livelihoods, employment opportunities, and agricultural income.8 A key to \nachieve these outcomes is commercialization of agricultural production. Mountain areas have \nno comparative advantage in cereals and low-value commodities, but have advantages in \ncertain  traditional  and  high-value  products  including  wool,  certified  seeds,  off-season \nvegetables, dairy, meat, and medicinal and aromatic plant products (MAPs). These products \nhave strong demand domestically and abroad, but commercial potential in mountain areas has \nbeen constrained by remoteness, fragmentation; and lack of infrastructure, farmers\u2019 capital, and \ninvestment. In this context, the project is intended to strengthen agricultural production and \nlinkages with markets, and improve the value addition retained by mountain people.  \n \n6.  Off-farm  employment  provides  potential  for  investment  back  into  farming  and \nagribusiness.  With  improving  road,  communication,  and  access  to  financial  services, \nconnectivity is growing between agribusiness and rural producers. Value chain studies and \nprivate sector consultations found increasing business interest in developing backward linkages \nto secure raw materials, and improve quality and cost efficiency by establishing facilities in \nmountain  districts  for  product  aggregation,  processing,  and  quality  management.9  A  rapid \nsurvey  resulted  in  130  expressions  of  interest  from  businesses  to  co-invest  in  mountain \nagribusiness development.10 There is potential to direct private sector investment and expertise \ninto mountain areas, if assistance is provided to mobilize interested producer groups, link them \nto downstream agribusiness and markets, and assist them to develop and implement viable \nbusiness plans. \n \n7.  Women increasingly make farming decisions, and invest labor in MAP collection and in \ncottage industry processing and weaving. Women often carry the burden of collecting firewood \nand livestock forage, and women\u2019s community groups have shown interest in rehabilitation of \ncommunity forest and rangelands for sustainable, reliable productivity. Women have successful \nenterprise groups for high-value products; e.g., carpets, sea buckthorn juice, traditional paper, \nand incense. These opportunities can be realized through social mobilization and provision of \nassistance to women and community groups to improve product quality and business skills, and \nto strengthen links with downstream business and markets. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009.

The  project  design  is  built  upon  the  lessons  learned,  institutional  structures,  and \noperational procedures established during the completed Crop Diversification Project (CDP)11 \nand the Community Livestock Development Project (CLDP) for Nepal,12 and the Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom-financed Livelihood from Forests Project. \nResearch from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Area Development in value \nchain development and community co-management of rangelands has also been integrated in \nthe design. Lessons applied in the design of the project include (i) participatory and demand-\ndriven  targeting  of  development,  and  (ii)  contract  service  provision  and  community-based \norganizations to mitigate limited government capacity. \n \n9.  The  project  design  keeps  in  view  the  post-conflict  situation  and  weak  institutional \ncapacities,  and  provides  flexibility  in  implementation  arrangements  to  allow  for  anticipated \nchanges  in  governance  systems  and  structures.  Decentralized  and  participatory  project \nimplementation, with strong involvement of nongovernment organization (NGO) community-\nbased groups and existing agribusiness structures, minimizes political risks.13 The Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Cooperatives  (MOAC)  has  successful  experience  in  implementing \ncommercialization projects through the Agro Enterprise Centre (AEC) of the Federation of Nepal \nChambers of Commerce and Industry,14 and modalities to contract NGO services to improve \noutreach capacity in remote areas\u2014developed and improved through projects including the \nCLDP, CDP, and Commercial Agriculture Development Project (CADP)15 in cooperation with \nADB. These modalities have been refined and incorporated in the project design. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project impact will be improved incomes in selected high mountain areas. The \nproject outcome will be that mountain agribusinesses are commercially viable in selected high \nmountain districts. The project is expected to result in (i) an additional $20.0 million gross \nproduction  value  per  year;  (ii)  7,500  jobs  created  by  participating  enterprises;  and  (iii) \nparticipating business enterprises achieving a rate of return on investment of no less than 15% \nper annum by 2017. The project will also improve mountain communities\u2019 resilience to climate \nchange by supporting the implementation of elements of community climate change adaptation \naction plans,16 and community forestry and rangeland group action plans for timber, grazing, \nand medicinal plants collection.17  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Three main outputs are envisaged: (i) an increased number of mountain agribusinesses \nmaking use of agribusiness grants, (ii) mountain agribusinesses have knowledge and access to \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2000.

The project will help agribusinesses, including individual farmers and \nfarmer groups, which meet eligibility criteria, apply for small and medium-sized agribusiness \ngrants provided by the project. Applicants must contribute a minimum of 20% to the cost of any \nagribusiness proposal. Applicants must be (i) legally registered19  farmer groups, cooperatives, \nor  community  organizations  with  business  based  on  mountain  agricultural  products;20  (ii) \nregistered community forestry groups and rangeland grazing groups; (iii) agribusiness firms \nregistered under the Nepal Company Act, with formal contract or direct supply links with value \nchain participants in high mountains; or (iv) individual business persons (legally registered with \na tax number) with at least five employees in the business and located in the HIMALI mountain \ndistricts. Staff of MOAC, the HIMALI project and its contracted service providers, and their \nfamily  members  are  not  eligible.  Agribusiness  grant  applications  will  be  assessed  by  an \nindependent grant assessment committee, in line with assessment criteria specified in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).21 The agribusiness grants will assist agribusinesses to \nimplement their business plans, thereby strengthening commercial activity and building links in \nvalue chain corridors, from input suppliers and producers to downstream marketing and agro-\nprocessing businesses.   \n \n12.  The following are examples of the business activities and facilities that will be considered \nfor HIMALI agribusiness grants: (i) production, processing, value-adding, and manufacture of \nfinished mountain products; (ii) collection, storage, grading, quality management, packing for \ndistribution,  and  marketing;  (iii)  agro-tourism  including  locally  produced  food  services, \nhandicrafts, and agricultural and natural resource experience-based tourism services products; \n(iv) facilities for aggregating and exporting agro-products from HIMALI mountain districts,  and \ndraft animal services and way-station facilities; (v) tracks, culverts and short road connections \nthat are essential for agribusiness development and that are co-funded by the concerned farmer \ngroups or agribusiness (i.e., not public tracks and roads); (vi) small-scale irrigation and water \nharvesting works that are owned, managed, and maintained by registered farmer groups; and \n(vii) nurseries, planting, and small civil works for community forestry and rangeland business \nresource development, including for timber, grazing and MAPs.  \n \n13.  To  improve  sustainability,  the  project  will  provide  agribusinesses  with  training  in \nimproved production and agro-processing technical and business knowledge. On a demand- \ndriven basis, agribusinesses will receive assistance from the AEC, and to a lesser extent from \nNGOs, in the preparation of business plans. The project will also upgrade five agricultural \nresearch and development stations to provide support and services to the private sector. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The  investment  project  will  comprise  three  components:  (i)  mountain  agribusiness \ndevelopment, (ii) value chain capacity development, and (iii) project management. Investment \nand financing plans are in Tables 1 and 2.     \n \n                                                \n18 Modest public\u2013private partnership arrangements are intended to be formed between the private sector and \ngovernment-owned research stations that have received project-funded technology upgrades. \n19 Under Companies Act 2063; Cooperative Act 2048; Society Registration Act 2034; Private Firm Registration Act \n2014.  \n20 Including high value crop products, livestock products, medicinal and aromatic plant products, processing, value-\nadding, marketing and distribution of these products and agricultural input supplies, draft-animal transport services, \nand agro-tourism. \n21 Accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n ", "  5 \n15.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $20 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. Table 2 summarizes the financing plan. The ADB \ngrant will finance 66% of the project cost, and the government is to provide $4.52 million \nequivalent to finance 15% of the project cost, including $3.78 million equivalent of taxes and \nduties.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOAC  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  carry  out  implementation  through  the \nDepartment of Livestock Services (DLS) and be responsible for overall project management and \ncoordination. AEC will be an implementing agency and responsible for implementation of part of \ncomponent 1. ADB will execute a separate project agreement with AEC for this purpose. MOAC \nwill establish a steering committee and a central PMU located in the DLS. MOAC will appoint to \nthe PMU a full-time project director (class I officer), a finance officer, and administration officer \nto ensure compliance with government regulations. The PMU will contract additional support \nstaff (accounting, administration, monitoring, reporting, and others) locally. The DLS regional \ndirectorates and senior DLS or DOA officers in each project district will assist in coordination, \nmonitoring, and evaluation as part of their line responsibilities. \n \n ", " 6    \n18.  To  mitigate  capacity  constraints  when  implementing  projects  in  remote  areas, \nexperience from other projects suggests that consultants attached to the PMU, and service \nproviders at the field level, are essential for timely and successful implementation. Therefore, \nthe PMU will be supported by (i) an independent agribusiness grant assessment committee \n(GAC) comprising experts contracted on a piece rate (i.e., per grant application assessed); and \n(ii) international consultants (49 person-months, for start-up and capacity building) and national \nconsultants  (446  person-months  for  the  PMU  and  needs-based  technical  advice).  The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  the  quality-based  selection  procedures  for  the  PMU \nconsultants and NGO management contract (package one), and the agribusiness capacity \ndevelopment contract (package two). Beneficiary communication and mobilization of farmer \ngroups will be conducted by NGOs recruited by the firm providing the PMU consultants. AEC \nwill  implement  activities  to  mobilize  agribusiness,  including  farmers  and  farmer  groups,  to \nprovide  business  planning  and  market  linkage  services  to  beneficiaries,  and  assist  with \npreparing grant applications and implementation of business development plans. \n \n19.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The project will address livelihoods in high mountain areas through development of \nrelevant  value  chains,  promoting  productive  private  sector  investments,  and  public  sector \ninfrastructure and services. Quantifiable economic benefits are expected only from the mountain \nagribusiness development component. Agribusiness development is strongly viable, with an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the investments of 27.2% and of 23.8% including the \ncomponent promotion and implementation costs. For the whole project, this benefits stream \nproduces a robust EIRR of 16.7%. The EIRR is not sensitive to a 10% increase in costs nor to a \n10% reduction in benefit, but falls slightly to 15.3% if benefits are delayed for 1 year. This \nsensitivity will be mitigated by the agribusiness capacity development consultant inputs in the \nfirst 18 months, as well as sufficient provision for delivery of support services to beneficiaries by \nAEC and social mobilization. \n \n21.  Based on cash flow analyses of 22 possible investments, the investment grants of \n$18.7 million will generate annual revenues of $17.6 million. Shared between profits, wages, \nagricultural supplies, and other supplies and services, members of the mountain communities \nare projected to receive $10.6 million of these annual income streams. \n \nB.  Governance \n22.  To ensure consistency, transparency, and economy in the procurement of goods, works, \nand services, the PMU will adhere to the Government of Nepal\u2019s Public Procurement Act and \nPublic Procurement Regulations 2007, and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  To  improve  accuracy  in  accounting  and  reduce  the  governance  risk,  the  PMU  will \nestablish  a  double  entry  accounting system.  Proprietary  accounting  software, training, and \nsystem establishment will be provided under the project. In addition, the PMU will prepare and \nimplement a robust code of conduct for their staff involved in the project\u2014ensuring, that the staff \nmembers working at the PMU do not have any conflict of interest with any sub-grant applicants. \nThe government will take the necessary steps to ensure that all applicable anticorruption laws of \nNepal, which apply to public officials, are effectively enforced.  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Nepal  and  its  executing  agency,  MOAC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  Supplementary \ngovernance measures include the use of an independent grant assessment committee for grant \nassessment  determination,  agribusiness  grant  payments  by  installment  to  allow  progress \ninspections to ensure funds are being used for the intended purpose of use, and direct payment \nto suppliers for procurement of equipment and contractors. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n24.  The project will generate employment for 7,500 men and women, directly benefitting up \nto 5,000 households in the project area. In the longer term, it will contribute to improving the \nlives of at least 88,00022 households active in various value chains through improved access to \n                                                \n22 Some 60% of households in the project districts are producers in at least one of the main agricultural value chains. \nMore are involved in processing, trade, transport, and other forms of economic engagement, both within and \noutside the project area. See Poverty and Social Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", " 8    \nmarkets, services, and employment. Poor and socially excluded groups will gain opportunities \nfor employment and supply of raw materials such as wool and MAPs, which do not necessarily \nrequire cash investment or ownership of land. Increased economic activity will also contribute to \nreinvigorating local societies and improving livelihood rewards to women in agriculture, herders, \nand traditional niche product producers. Such benefits will be realized through implementation \nof the gender and equity social inclusion (GESI) plan. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n25.  Environment. The project is categorized B regarding potential environmental impacts. \nAn initial environmental examination was conducted on project activities, including assessment \nof 22 representative agribusiness models, and rehabilitation of representative MOAC district \noffices and research stations. The initial environmental examination indicates minor potential \nimpacts during rehabilitation and construction of facilities (quarrying and timber use must be \nsustainable) and from agribusiness operations (e.g., sustainable sourcing of raw materials and \nfirewood, and appropriate waste management). Positive impacts are expected from improved \nincomes resulting in less reliance on wild resources, and from support to implement community \nforestry,  rangeland  management,  and  climate  adaptation  action  plans.  An  environmental \nassessment and review framework has been prepared, and subprojects that may have an \nimpact on protected areas of ecological or archaeological values will be screened out during the \nsubproject identification phase. \n \n26.  Resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  C  regarding  involuntary  resettlement.  No \nnegative  resettlement  or  social  impacts  are  expected.  The  project  will  not  involve  land \nacquisition. The project will support screened agribusiness proposals that include productive \ninfrastructure, and will upgrade MOAC facilities on government land. Resettlement due diligence \nis part of the proposal selection criteria. All agribusiness proposals must include evidence of \nland ownership or land rights-of-way. Any issue of resettlement will result in the GAC rejecting \nthe  proposal.  Due  diligence  to  obtain  evidence  of  land  ownership  will  be  carried  out  by \nagribusiness proponents.  \n \n27.  Indigenous  people. The  project  is categorized  B  regarding  impacts  on  indigenous \npeople. During project preparation, extensive and meaningful consultation was undertaken with \nindigenous peoples in the project districts consistent with five requirements specified in the \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009, as amended to date). The project has only positive benefits \nto  indigenous  people.  For  disadvantaged  indigenous  peoples,  barriers  to  participation  and \nbenefit by indigenous people are similar to those of other disadvantaged groups, and have been \naddressed through project activities listed in the poverty reduction and social strategy, and the \nGESI plan. A separate indigenous people plan has not been prepared because the indigenous \npeoples constitute about half of the project beneficiaries and the project has only positive \nimpacts  on  them.  As  permitted  by  the  Safeguards  Policy  Statement,  the  elements  of  an \nindigenous  people  plan  have  been  integrated  with  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident. \n \n28.  Some indigenous people are trade and business leaders in their areas and will be \nimportant actors in agribusiness development. Other marginalized groups may face participation \nconstraints. The project recognizes that successful business development will not be driven by \nmarginalized indigenous people with low skills and financial risk taking ability, but they will \nbenefit directly from employment in expanded commercial activity and better value marketing \nopportunities. Due diligence required to meet selection criteria for project agribusiness grants, \nand a comprehensive communication strategy, provide sufficient safeguards to avoid negative \nimpacts and to enhance positive impacts for indigenous people. The concerns of indigenous \n ", "  9 \npeople are no different from those of other categories of disadvantaged groups (e.g., Dalits, \nlandless people, or women) and are covered in a GESI plan. The project will be implemented in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  The project is categorized low risk. The Asian Development Fund project is built on the \nsuccessful experience of the ADB-financed CDP, and the CLDP, which was rated successful in \nits project completion report.23 The fluid political situation and potential for conflict affected the \nachievements of these projects, and remains the main risk. The executing agency, MOAC, has \ncapacity  and  experience  in  implementing  externally  financed  projects,  and  safeguard \ncategorization is B or C. \n \n30.  Stringent financial management assessment by the PMU will mitigate financial risks \nassociated  with  business  development  by  farmer  groups  and  agro-enterprises.  Financial \ngovernance is a serious concern in Nepal. For agribusiness grant disbursements, risk mitigation \nis through the use of agribusiness grant agreements (legal contracts), and vendor payment and \npost-payment for final grant installment following verification of investments by field staff.  \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFluid political situation and  Good  governance  and  due  diligence  process  for  agribusiness \npotential for conflict  development \nDecentralized  and  participatory  project  implementation,  strong \ninvolvement of community-based groups, and existing agribusiness \nstructures \nFailure to maintain financial  Anticorruption  and  procurement  procedures  will  follow  ADB \ngovernance  requirements outlined in PAM. \nContracted NGOs are responsible for monitoring completion of legally \nbinding grant agreements, and payments made after verification. \nPayments will be made under provisions of Government of Nepal and \nADB financial regulations. \nWorsening natural resources  All agribusiness plan applications will be supported by EMP \nsituation caused by climate  Project and partners provide advice, training, and finance for forest \nchange and exploitation  and rangeland regeneration, and climate adapted technologies and \nprocesses \nSlow implementation and poor  Adequate  nongovernment  outreach  and  business  support  with \nmarket connectivity in remote  contract performance incentives \nareas  Infrastructure supported by other projects \nAgro-Enterprise Center contracted to link markets \nPoor management or improper  Adequate  support  for  business  planning,  capacity  building,  due \npractices including lack of  diligence  assessment,  and  screening  and  implementation  of \ntransparency of procedures,  agribusiness plans and grant applications \nselection, and decision making  Contracted NGOs are made responsible to monitor performance of \nbusinesses \nRehabilitated MOAC service  Only a small number of prioritized facilities with identified benefit \nfacilities not maintained  streams are supported. \nMOAC assures continued operating funds for these facilities. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EMP = environmental management plan, MOAC = Ministry of Agriculture and \nCooperatives, NGO = nongovernment organization, PAM = project administration manual. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2009.
