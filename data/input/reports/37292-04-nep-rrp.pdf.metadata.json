A demand-driven approach will be used to (i) mobilize interested producer \ngroups; (ii) provide support for quality improvement, value adding, and product aggregation into \nquantities  of  scale  sufficient  to  attract  demand-side  business;  (iii) stimulate  private  sector \nagribusiness  development;  and  (iv)  reduce  risk  exposure  to  businesses  investing  in  the  high \nmountain  districts.  Project  grants  will  be  provided  to  eligible  entities  for  implementing  viable \nagribusiness  plans  that  demonstrate  income  and  employment  benefits  in  the  project  districts. \nThe  private  sector  has  expressed  interest  in  a  range  of  suitable  business  development, \nincluding (i) organized production of high-value products through contract or supply agreements; \n(ii) established collection, post-harvest quality grading, and storage facilities; (iii) processing and \nvalue adding; and (iv) quality certification to access high-value markets.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nAbout 80% of Nepal\u2019s population lives in rural areas that have been left behind national \neconomic growth. The high mountain areas are the least-developed among rural areas, mainly \nbecause  of  limited  access  to  markets  and  lack  of  investments.  These  areas  are  highly \nsusceptible  to  the  impact  of  climate  change,  for  which  Nepal  is  one  of  the  most  vulnerable \ncountries in Asia. Nepal recently became a net food importer, partly because of lack of growth in \nagriculture,  despite  it  employing  66%  of  the  population  and  contributing  about  35%  to  the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product. The growth of the agriculture sector has been erratic largely \nbecause of its continued dependence on rainfall for irrigation and the dominance of cereal crop \nproduction\u2014growth  averaged  only  2.5%  in  the  past  5  years  (FY2006\u2013FY2010).3  Ten project \ndistricts4  were  selected  based  on  selection  criteria  including  food  insecurity5  (over  60%  of  the \nproject  district  population  is  malnourished)  and  high  incidence  of  poverty  (over  60%).6  This  is \nsignificantly greater than the country\u2019s overall income poverty incidence rate of 31% and urban \npoverty  rate  of  10%.  These  trends  also  reflect  the  vulnerability  of  mountain  agriculture  to \nweather and geophysical conditions as well as infrastructural constraints.  \n \n4. \nThe  widening  gap  between  rich  and  poor  regions  has  added  to  social  tensions, \ncontributed  to  conflict  in  the  past,  and  continued  to  pressure  the  government  for  solutions. \nOvergrazing  and  exploitation  of  forest  and  wild  medicinal  plants  have  degraded  community \nlivelihood assets and weakened resilience to climate change. Despite the significant contribution \nof  agriculture  to  the  economy,  the  sector\u2019s  performance  is  constrained  by  farmers\u2019  limited \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2009.

More  than  1 million  Nepalese \nemigrate  for  employment  abroad,  resulting  in  seasonal  households  headed  by  women  and \nfeminization  of  agricultural  labor.  However,  promising  opportunities  exist  for  the  agriculture \nsector  in  value  addition,  marketing  efficiency,  reducing  postharvest  losses,  and  sustainable \nforest and rangeland production. \n \n5. \nThe project design is intended to contribute to the achievement of government and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  development  outcomes,  reflecting  the  new  political  realities  and \neconomic  strategies  of  Nepal.  Reflecting  the  lessons  learned  and  recommendations  in  the \nCountry Assistance Program Evaluation for the Country Strategy and Program 2005\u20132009,7 the \nADB country partnership strategy 2010\u20132012 identifies the development outcomes as improved \nfood  security,  rural  livelihoods,  employment  opportunities,  and  agricultural  income.8  A  key  to \nachieve  these  outcomes  is  commercialization  of  agricultural  production.  Mountain  areas  have \nno  comparative  advantage  in  cereals  and  low-value  commodities,  but  have  advantages  in \ncertain \nincluding  wool,  certified  seeds,  off-season \nvegetables,  dairy,  meat,  and  medicinal  and  aromatic  plant  products  (MAPs).  These  products \nhave strong demand domestically and abroad, but commercial potential in mountain areas has \nbeen constrained by remoteness, fragmentation; and lack of infrastructure, farmers\u2019 capital, and \ninvestment.  In  this  context,  the  project  is  intended  to  strengthen  agricultural  production  and \nlinkages with markets, and improve the value addition retained by mountain people.  \n \ninto \nfarming  and \n6. \nagribusiness.  With \nfinancial  services, \nconnectivity  is  growing  between  agribusiness  and  rural  producers.  Value  chain  studies  and \nprivate sector consultations found increasing business interest in developing backward linkages \nto  secure  raw  materials,  and  improve  quality  and  cost  efficiency  by  establishing  facilities  in \nmountain  districts  for  product  aggregation,  processing,  and  quality  management.9  A  rapid \nsurvey  resulted  in  130  expressions  of  interest  from  businesses  to  co-invest  in  mountain \nagribusiness development.10 There is potential to direct private sector investment and expertise \ninto mountain areas, if assistance is provided to mobilize interested producer groups, link them \nto  downstream  agribusiness  and  markets,  and  assist  them  to  develop  and  implement  viable \nbusiness plans. \n \nWomen increasingly make farming decisions, and invest labor in MAP collection and in \n7. \ncottage industry processing and weaving. Women often carry the burden of collecting firewood \nand  livestock  forage,  and  women\u2019s  community  groups  have  shown  interest  in  rehabilitation  of \ncommunity forest and rangelands for sustainable, reliable productivity. Women have successful \nenterprise groups for high-value products; e.g., carpets, sea buckthorn juice, traditional paper, \nand  incense.  These  opportunities  can  be  realized  through social  mobilization  and  provision  of \nassistance to women and community groups to improve product quality and business skills, and \nto strengthen links with downstream business and markets. \n \n\nimproving  road,  communication,  and  access \n\nOff-farm  employment  provides  potential \n\ninvestment  back \nto \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009.

Lessons  applied  in  the  design  of  the  project  include  (i)  participatory  and  demand-\ndriven  targeting  of  development,  and  (ii)  contract  service  provision  and  community-based \norganizations to mitigate limited government capacity. \n \n9. \nThe  project  design  keeps  in  view  the  post-conflict  situation  and  weak  institutional \ncapacities,  and  provides  flexibility  in  implementation  arrangements  to  allow  for  anticipated \nchanges  in  governance  systems  and  structures.  Decentralized  and  participatory  project \nimplementation,  with  strong  involvement  of  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  community-\nbased  groups  and  existing  agribusiness  structures,  minimizes  political  risks.13  The  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Cooperatives \nimplementing \ncommercialization projects through the Agro Enterprise Centre (AEC) of the Federation of Nepal \nChambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry,14  and  modalities  to  contract  NGO  services  to  improve \noutreach  capacity  in  remote  areas\u2014developed  and  improved  through  projects  including  the \nCLDP,  CDP,  and  Commercial  Agriculture  Development  Project  (CADP)15  in  cooperation  with \nADB.

The \n10. \nproject outcome will be that mountain agribusinesses are commercially  viable in selected high \nmountain  districts.  The  project  is  expected  to  result  in  (i)  an  additional  $20.0  million  gross \nproduction  value  per  year;  (ii)  7,500  jobs  created  by  participating  enterprises;  and  (iii) \nparticipating business enterprises achieving a rate of return on investment of no less than 15% \nper annum by 2017. The project will also  improve mountain communities\u2019 resilience to climate \nchange by supporting the implementation of elements of community climate change adaptation \naction  plans,16  and  community  forestry  and  rangeland  group  action  plans  for  timber,  grazing, \nand medicinal plants collection.17  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThree main outputs are envisaged: (i) an increased number of mountain agribusinesses \nmaking use of agribusiness grants, (ii) mountain agribusinesses have knowledge and access to \n                                                \n11  ADB.  2000.

The project will help agribusinesses, including individual farmers and \nfarmer  groups,  which  meet  eligibility  criteria,  apply  for  small  and  medium-sized  agribusiness \ngrants provided by the project. Applicants must contribute a minimum of 20% to the cost of any \nagribusiness proposal. Applicants must be (i) legally registered19  farmer groups, cooperatives, \nor  community  organizations  with  business  based  on  mountain  agricultural  products;20  (ii) \nregistered  community  forestry  groups  and  rangeland  grazing  groups;  (iii)  agribusiness  firms \nregistered under the Nepal Company Act, with formal contract or direct supply links with value \nchain participants in high mountains; or (iv) individual business persons (legally registered with \na tax number) with at least five employees in the business and located in the HIMALI mountain \ndistricts.  Staff  of  MOAC,  the  HIMALI  project  and  its  contracted  service  providers,  and  their \nfamily  members  are  not  eligible.  Agribusiness  grant  applications  will  be  assessed  by  an \nindependent  grant  assessment  committee,  in  line  with  assessment  criteria  specified  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM).21  The  agribusiness  grants  will  assist  agribusinesses  to \nimplement their business plans, thereby strengthening commercial activity and building links in \nvalue  chain corridors, from  input  suppliers  and  producers  to downstream  marketing  and agro-\nprocessing businesses.   \n \n12. \nThe following are examples of the business activities and facilities that will be considered \nfor  HIMALI  agribusiness  grants:  (i)  production,  processing,  value-adding,  and  manufacture  of \nfinished  mountain  products;  (ii)  collection,  storage,  grading,  quality  management,  packing  for \ndistribution,  and  marketing;  (iii)  agro-tourism  including  locally  produced  food  services, \nhandicrafts, and agricultural and natural resource experience-based tourism services products; \n(iv) facilities for aggregating and exporting agro-products from HIMALI mountain districts,  and \ndraft  animal  services and way-station facilities;  (v)  tracks,  culverts  and  short  road  connections \nthat are essential for agribusiness development and that are co-funded by the concerned farmer \ngroups  or  agribusiness  (i.e.,  not  public  tracks  and  roads);  (vi)  small-scale  irrigation  and  water \nharvesting  works  that  are  owned,  managed,  and  maintained by  registered farmer groups;  and \n(vii)  nurseries,  planting,  and  small  civil  works  for  community  forestry  and  rangeland  business \nresource development, including for timber, grazing and MAPs.  \n \n13. \nTo  improve  sustainability,  the  project  will  provide  agribusinesses  with  training  in \nimproved  production  and  agro-processing  technical  and  business  knowledge.  On  a  demand- \ndriven basis, agribusinesses will receive assistance from the AEC, and to a lesser extent from \nNGOs,  in  the  preparation  of  business  plans.  The  project  will  also  upgrade  five  agricultural \nresearch and development stations to provide support and services to the private sector. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  investment  project  will  comprise  three  components:  (i)  mountain  agribusiness \ndevelopment,  (ii)  value  chain  capacity  development,  and  (iii)  project  management.

The  PMU  will  contract  additional  support \nstaff  (accounting,  administration,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  others)  locally.  The  DLS  regional \ndirectorates and senior  DLS  or  DOA  officers  in  each project  district  will  assist  in coordination, \nmonitoring, and evaluation as part of their line responsibilities. \n \n\n \n\n\f 6  \n\n \n\nimplementing  projects \n\nTo  mitigate  capacity  constraints  when \n\nin  remote  areas, \n18. \nexperience  from  other  projects  suggests  that  consultants  attached  to  the  PMU,  and  service \nproviders  at  the  field  level,  are  essential  for  timely  and  successful  implementation.  Therefore, \nthe  PMU  will  be  supported  by  (i)  an  independent  agribusiness  grant  assessment  committee \n(GAC) comprising experts contracted on a piece rate (i.e., per grant application assessed); and \n(ii) international consultants (49 person-months, for start-up and capacity building) and national \nconsultants  (446  person-months  for  the  PMU  and  needs-based  technical  advice).  The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  the  quality-based  selection  procedures  for  the  PMU \nconsultants  and  NGO  management  contract  (package  one),  and  the  agribusiness  capacity \ndevelopment  contract  (package  two).  Beneficiary  communication  and  mobilization  of  farmer \ngroups  will  be  conducted  by  NGOs  recruited  by  the  firm  providing  the  PMU  consultants.  AEC \nwill  implement  activities  to  mobilize  agribusiness,  including  farmers  and  farmer  groups,  to \nprovide  business  planning  and  market  linkage  services  to  beneficiaries,  and  assist  with \npreparing grant applications and implementation of business development plans. \n \n19. \nthe PAM. \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date \nManagement \n\n(i) Oversight body \n\nArrangements \n1 May 2011\u20132017 \n30 April 2017 \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing agency \n(iv) Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n \nConsulting Services \nPackage 1: PMU consultants and \nNGO management  \nPackage 2: Agribusiness capacity \ndevelopment \nIndividual Specialists \nDisbursement \n\nProject Steering Committee \nSecretary, MOAC (chairperson) \njoint secretary (planning), MOAC; director general, DLS; \nrepresentatives of DFTQC; DOC; FNCCI; MOF; NPC; and project \ndirector, PMU; executive director, NARC (members) \nMOAC \nAEC, Kathmandu and districts \nMOAC (in DLS) \nCPP  \nShopping \n \nQBS \n\nKathmandu \n60 \n333 contracts \n \n423 person-months \n<10 NGO contracts \n72 person-months \n\n$515,100 \n$ 5,133,600  \n \n$1,785,600 \n$972,300 \n$406,000 \n\nQBS \n\nCQS \nDisbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand arrangements the government and ADB have agreed upon. \n\n3 \n\n$28,200 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AEC  =  Agro  Enterprise Centre,  CPP  =  Community  Participation  in  Procurement, \nCQS  =  consultant  qualification  selection,  DFTQC  =  Department  of  Food  Technology  and  Quality  Control,  DLS  = \nDepartment of Livestock, DOC = Department of Customs, FNCCI = Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce \nand  Industry,  MOAC  =  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Cooperatives,  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  NARC  =  Nepal \nAgricultural Research Council, NGO = nongovernment organization, NPC = National Planning Commission, PMU = \nproject management unit, QBS = quality-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  project  will  address  livelihoods  in  high  mountain  areas  through  development  of \n20. \nrelevant  value  chains,  promoting  productive  private  sector  investments,  and  public  sector \ninfrastructure and services. Quantifiable economic benefits are expected only from the mountain \nagribusiness  development  component.  Agribusiness  development  is  strongly  viable,  with  an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the investments of 27.2% and of 23.8% including the \ncomponent  promotion  and  implementation  costs.  For  the  whole  project,  this  benefits  stream \nproduces a robust EIRR of 16.7%. The EIRR is not sensitive to a 10% increase in costs nor to a \n10%  reduction  in  benefit,  but  falls  slightly  to  15.3%  if  benefits  are  delayed  for  1  year.  This \nsensitivity  will  be  mitigated  by  the  agribusiness  capacity  development  consultant  inputs  in  the \nfirst 18 months, as well as sufficient provision for delivery of support services to beneficiaries by \nAEC and social mobilization. \n \n21. \nBased  on  cash  flow  analyses  of  22  possible  investments,  the  investment  grants  of \n$18.7 million  will  generate  annual  revenues  of  $17.6  million.  Shared  between  profits,  wages, \nagricultural  supplies,  and  other  supplies  and  services,  members  of  the  mountain  communities \nare projected to receive $10.6 million of these annual income streams. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nTo ensure consistency, transparency, and economy in the procurement of goods, works, \nand  services,  the  PMU  will  adhere to  the  Government  of  Nepal\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act  and \nPublic Procurement Regulations 2007, and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time)  and Guidelines  on  the  Use of  Consultants (2010,  as amended from time  to \ntime).  To  improve  accuracy  in  accounting  and  reduce  the  governance  risk,  the  PMU  will \nestablish  a  double  entry  accounting  system.  Proprietary  accounting  software,  training,  and \nsystem establishment will be provided under the project. In addition, the PMU will prepare and \nimplement a robust code of conduct for their staff involved in the project\u2014ensuring, that the staff \nmembers working at the PMU do not have any conflict of interest with any sub-grant applicants. \nThe government will take the necessary steps to ensure that all applicable anticorruption laws of \nNepal, which apply to public officials, are effectively enforced.  \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Nepal  and  its  executing  agency,  MOAC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  Supplementary \ngovernance measures include the use of an independent grant assessment committee for grant \nassessment  determination,  agribusiness  grant  payments  by  installment  to  allow  progress \ninspections to ensure funds are being used for the intended purpose of use, and direct payment \nto suppliers for procurement of equipment and contractors. \n\nC. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\n24. \nThe project will generate employment for 7,500 men and women, directly benefitting up \nto  5,000  households  in  the  project  area.  In  the  longer  term,  it  will  contribute  to  improving  the \nlives of at least 88,00022 households active in various value chains through improved access to \n\n                                                \n22 Some 60% of households in the project districts are producers in at least one of the main agricultural value chains. \nMore are  involved  in  processing,  trade,  transport,  and  other  forms  of  economic  engagement,  both  within  and \noutside  the  project  area.  See  Poverty  and  Social  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f 8  \n\n \n\nmarkets,  services,  and employment.  Poor  and  socially  excluded  groups will  gain opportunities \nfor employment and supply of raw materials such as wool and MAPs, which do not necessarily \nrequire cash investment or ownership of land. Increased economic activity will also contribute to \nreinvigorating local societies and improving livelihood rewards to women in agriculture, herders, \nand traditional niche product producers. Such benefits will be realized through implementation \nof the gender and equity social inclusion (GESI) plan. \n\nD. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  B  regarding  potential  environmental  impacts. \n25. \nAn initial environmental examination was conducted on project activities, including assessment \nof  22  representative  agribusiness  models,  and  rehabilitation  of  representative  MOAC  district \noffices  and  research  stations.  The  initial  environmental  examination  indicates  minor  potential \nimpacts  during  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  facilities  (quarrying  and  timber  use  must  be \nsustainable) and from agribusiness operations (e.g., sustainable sourcing of raw materials and \nfirewood,  and  appropriate  waste  management).  Positive  impacts  are  expected  from  improved \nincomes resulting in less reliance on wild resources, and from support to implement community \nforestry,  rangeland  management,  and  climate  adaptation  action  plans.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  has  been  prepared,  and  subprojects  that  may  have  an \nimpact on protected areas of ecological or archaeological values will be screened out during the \nsubproject identification phase. \n \n26. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  C  regarding  involuntary  resettlement.  No \nnegative  resettlement  or  social  impacts  are  expected.  The  project  will  not  involve  land \nacquisition.  The  project  will  support  screened  agribusiness  proposals  that  include  productive \ninfrastructure, and will upgrade MOAC facilities on government land. Resettlement due diligence \nis  part  of  the  proposal  selection  criteria.  All  agribusiness  proposals  must  include  evidence  of \nland ownership or land rights-of-way. Any issue of resettlement will result in the GAC rejecting \nthe  proposal.  Due  diligence  to  obtain  evidence  of  land  ownership  will  be  carried  out  by \nagribusiness proponents.  \n \n27. \nIndigenous  people.  The  project  is  categorized  B  regarding  impacts  on  indigenous \npeople. During project preparation, extensive and meaningful consultation was undertaken with \nindigenous  peoples  in  the  project  districts  consistent  with  five  requirements  specified  in  the \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009, as amended to date). The project has only positive benefits \nto  indigenous  people.  For  disadvantaged  indigenous  peoples,  barriers  to  participation  and \nbenefit by indigenous people are similar to those of other disadvantaged groups, and have been \naddressed through project activities listed in the poverty reduction and social strategy, and the \nGESI plan. A separate indigenous people plan has not been prepared because the indigenous \npeoples  constitute  about  half  of  the  project  beneficiaries  and  the  project  has  only  positive \nimpacts  on  them.  As  permitted  by  the  Safeguards  Policy  Statement,  the  elements  of  an \nindigenous  people  plan  have  been  integrated  with  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident. \n \n28. \nSome  indigenous  people  are  trade  and  business  leaders  in  their  areas  and  will  be \nimportant actors in agribusiness development. Other marginalized groups may face participation \nconstraints. The project recognizes that successful business development will not be driven by \nmarginalized  indigenous  people  with  low  skills  and  financial  risk  taking  ability,  but  they  will \nbenefit  directly  from  employment  in  expanded  commercial  activity  and  better  value  marketing \nopportunities.  Due  diligence required to meet  selection criteria for  project  agribusiness grants, \nand  a comprehensive communication  strategy, provide  sufficient  safeguards  to  avoid  negative \nimpacts  and  to  enhance  positive  impacts  for  indigenous  people.  The  concerns  of  indigenous \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\npeople  are  no  different  from  those  of  other  categories  of  disadvantaged  groups  (e.g., Dalits, \nlandless people, or women) and are covered in a GESI plan. The project will be implemented in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\nE. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nin \n\nimplementing  externally \n\n29. \nThe project is categorized low risk. The Asian Development Fund project is built on the \nsuccessful experience of the ADB-financed CDP, and the CLDP, which was rated successful in \nits project completion report.23 The fluid political situation and potential for conflict affected the \nachievements of these projects, and remains the main risk. The executing agency, MOAC, has \ncapacity  and  experience \nfinanced  projects,  and  safeguard \ncategorization is B or C. \n \nStringent  financial  management  assessment  by  the  PMU  will  mitigate  financial  risks \n30. \nassociated  with  business  development  by  farmer  groups  and  agro-enterprises.  Financial \ngovernance is a serious concern in Nepal. For agribusiness grant disbursements, risk mitigation \nis through the use of agribusiness grant agreements (legal contracts), and vendor payment and \npost-payment for final grant installment following verification of investments by field staff.  \n \n31.
