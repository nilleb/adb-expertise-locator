The report also describes \nproposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  for  Access  to  Green  Finance,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe  project  will  leverage  Tajikistan\u2019s  sound  microfinance  system  to  provide  credit  for \n2. \nhouseholds  for  energy-efficient  and  environment-friendly  homes. 1\nThe  JFPR  TA  grant  of \n$750,000 will build the capacity of participating microfinance institutions (MFIs) and the project \nmanagement unit (PMU) to facilitate efficient green finance intermediation and promote energy \nefficiency, particularly for rural households and women. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nEnergy challenges coupled with inefficient energy environment. Tajikistan depends \non  hydroelectric  sources  for  98%  of  its  electricity  needs.  In  summer,  when  demand  is  low  but \nglacial  melt  is  high,  there  is  an  electricity  surplus.  In  winter,  since  rivers  freeze,  hydroelectric \npower generation declines by 50%. This results in power outages of up to 18\u201320 hours per day \nduring winter in grid-connected areas. The situation is worse for the 24,000 households located \nin  remote  off-grid  areas.  Over  73%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas2 and  spends much  of \nthe winter with limited electricity, with lighting and heating in short supply.3 In addition, more than \n50% (over 500,000 households) of the country\u2019s housing units were built in the 1960 and 1970s. \nMany of these homes are in rural areas, and their residents include a large number of the 46.7% \nof  families  who  live  below  the  poverty  line. 4 These  homes  need  improvements  to  increase \nenergy efficiency and reduce household spending on fossil fuels.5\n  \n \n4. \nThe  problem  of  energy  poverty  is  complicated  by  inefficient  energy  transmission \nconsumption,  and  inadequate  household  understanding  about  how  to  use  energy  in  cost-\neffective, environmentally friendly ways.6 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nestimates  that  the  country\u2019s  total  energy  bill  was  about  $1  billion  in  2008,  which  amounted  to \n20% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product that year.7\n This leaves insufficient energy for other \nproductive  investment  activities,  limiting  economic  growth  potential.  Rural  households  depend \non fuels such as kerosene, diesel, gasoline, firewood, coal, and manure for their energy needs. \nWomen  in  these  households  spend  a  significant  amount  of  time  gathering  firewood.  Use  of \n\n                                                \n1  Subborrowers at household level may include individuals doing microbusiness activities.  \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

Families  are \nunaware of available options to lower energy costs and improve household living conditions. \n \n5. \nPilot  interventions  by  other  donors.  German  development  cooperation  through  GIZ \nand Habitat for Humanity have undertaken pilot projects for green finance. The Warm Comfort \nprogram  implemented  by  GIZ  has  installed  thermal  insulation  and  energy-efficient  solutions  in \nabout  200  households  in  the  Gorno-Badakshan  region.8 In  this  program,  home  improvement \nsolutions  for  energy  efficiency  were  manufactured  and  supplied  by  local  cooperatives. 9\n The \nHabitat  for  Humanity  program  for  home  energy  efficiency  improvements  collaborates  with  two \nMFIs\u2014IMON  and  Arvand\u2013\u2013for  household  loans  to  cover  costs  for  energy-efficient  roofing  and \nother  carpentry  works  (doors,  windows,  flooring).  The  program  has  so  far  reached  over  6,000 \nhouseholds since 2011. Key lessons learned from both projects are that (i) home improvements \nreduce  heating  requirements  up  to  40%,  resulting  to  energy  savings;  (ii)  strengthening  public \nawareness of energy efficiency and better energy consumption patterns are necessary; and (iii) \nMFIs\u2019  credit  assessment  capacity  for  home  improvement  loan  clients  must  be  strengthened. \nBoth pilot projects cannot expand due to lack of funds, particularly in local currency. \n \n6. \nNeed  to  scale  up  and expand  pilot  interventions. Although small-scale interventions \nhave  been  initiated  by  these  donors,  more  than  50%  of  the  country\u2019s  households  are  still  in \nneed of home improvements for energy efficiency or off-grid clean power generation. A larger-\nscale  intervention  with  a focus  on  energy  efficiency  and  environment-friendly  solutions\u2014smart \ngreen energy solutions (SGES)\u2014can help address the energy challenges that Tajikistan faces. \nThe proposed project will engage the country\u2019s microfinance system to provide affordable credit \nfor SGES.10 SGES can decrease energy consumption by 15%\u201350%, enabling these households \nto  consume  less  fossil  fuel. 11 A household  survey  commissioned  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  also  indicated  potential  demand  for  solar  SGES,  with  48%  of  households \nexpressing interest in acquiring a solar SGES. 12 Some 91% of these households indicated that \nthey would borrow to purchase solar SGES if loans were available.13\n \n \n7. \nProvision  of  better  financial  access  to  smart  green  energy  solutions.  The  project \nwill  address  the  two  key  barriers  limiting  effective  demand:  lack  of  affordable  financing,  and \ninsufficient  buyer  and  lender  awareness  about  SGES.  The  project  will  provide  loans  through \nselected MFIs to households and micro entrepreneurs to purchase and install affordable SGES. \nInnovative  promotion  and  delivery  mechanisms  will  be  used  to  help  make  SGES  widely \n\n                                                \n8  The Warm Comfort program partnered with a microfinance institution, Madina, in the Gorno-Badakhshan region. \n9  GIZ confirmed that local cooperatives are fully operational and making sustainable profits. \n10 For  the  purpose  of  this  project,  SGES  are  defined  as  products  acquired  by  households  that  improve  household \nenergy efficiency, or that consume energy more efficiently than existing products, or that generate energy utilizing \nan  environment-friendly  technology.  The  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments  in  Appendix  2)  contains  a  nonexclusive  list  of  these products  that  includes energy-efficient  roofs  and \ndoors, double-glazed windows, advanced water pumps, solar water heaters, and systems generating electricity by \nsolar power. The list will be amended from time to time by agreement between ADB and the government, including \nfollowing the introduction of new technologies or in response to requests by MFIs participating in the project. \n\n11 Initial List of Smart Green Energy Solutions Products (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nA  household  survey  showed  that  about  30%  of  off-grid  households  currently  use  diesel  generators.  They  would \nbenefit from solar home solutions, as the operation and maintenance cost is lower than generators. Twenty percent \nof households that currently use firewood and coal for heating purposes expressed interest in credit to purchase \nsolar water heaters, which can be used year-round and have low operation and maintenance expenses. \n\n12 Tajikistan\u2019s  geography  and  high  horizontal  solar  irradiance  (4  kilowatt  hours  per  square  meter  per  day)  are \nparticularly  suited  for  harnessing  solar  energy  solutions,  especially  in  off-grid  areas.  Solar  solutions  can  include \nsolar panel-based electrification solutions and other solar products. \n\n13 ADB  undertook  a  survey  of  560  households  in  April\u2013May  2012  in  on-grid  and  off-grid  areas  of  15  districts  in \nTajikistan,  which  found  that  expenditure  for  kerosene,  diesel,  propane,  wood,  coal,  manure,  and  candles  for \nlighting, heating, and cooking needs averaged $200 per annum. \n\n\facceptable  and  affordable  to  low-income  households.14\n The  MFI  support  will  include  capacity \nbuilding and technical advice to MFIs and their clients from SGES experts and engineers who \nwill complete needs assessments, discuss options, and advise on SGES loan structuring. \n \nThe cost of SGES varies widely. For example, a small household may be able to replace \n8. \nall of its incandescent lightbulbs with more energy-efficient bulbs for less than $100. However, \nthe cost of other SGES is several multiples of the average monthly income of low-income Tajik \nhouseholds.  Many  SGES  are  unaffordable  if  they  must  be  paid  up  front,  but  are  feasible  for \nfamilies  if  credit  is  made  available  on  reasonable  terms  and  tenor.  To  achieve  meaningful \nhousehold  energy  savings,  complementary  SGES  products  can  be  bundled  together.  For \nexample,  a  household  renovation  may  include  energy-efficient  roofs,  double-glazed  windows, \ninsulated  doors,  and  insulated  ceilings  and  floors.  High-cost  SGES  (such  as  energy-efficient \nwater pumps) may be shared by multiple households borrowing from an MFI as a group. SGES \nloan  size  per  product  financed  under  the  project  is  expected  to  range  from  $200  to  $5,000 \nequivalent to accommodate ranges of household income and SGES preferences.15\n \n \nSustainable  green  finance.  During  the  project,  the  MFIs  will  borrow  from  a  Green \n9. \nFinance  Fund  set  up  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  with  an  $8.8  million  grant  provided  by \nADB for the credit line. The credit line will be lent by the MOF to MFIs under subsidiary loans \nwith  subsidiary  loan  interest  and  principal  repayments  being  revolved  on  a  perpetual  basis \nduring and after the project\u2019s implementation period. The Green Finance Fund will provide credit \nline support to MFIs for energy efficiency initiatives. The project\u2019s credit lines to MFIs will be in \nlocal  currency  with  5-year  duration.  This  will  help  MFI  borrowers  without  exposing  them  to \ncurrency  risk,  as  well  as  provide  longer-term  liquidity  to  MFIs.  By  taking  loans  to  invest  in \nhousehold  energy  efficiency,  clients  will  experience  measurable  savings  in  energy  expenses. \nThis will help people understand the benefits of energy efficiency investments. \n \n10. \nThe project aims to support commercial viability for SGES. This approach is recognized \nas  an  important  component  of  the  government\u2019s  strategy  to  provide  a  sustainable  energy-\nefficient  environment.16\n Pilot  interventions  (para.  5)  have  helped  develop  supplier  capacity  to \nmeet market demand. Once the commercial viability of green finance is proven, MFIs and banks \nwill use their own capital to finance SGES acquisition by households and businesses.  \n \n11. \nThe project will help strengthen MFI lending for energy-efficient products, supporting MFI \nportfolio  diversification  strategies.  MFIs  that  are  interested  in  developing  or  expanding  their \nSGES loan portfolios must meet the eligibility criteria agreed by the MOF and ADB (para. 20).17\n \nMFIs  selected  for  the  project  will  benefit  from  knowledge  and  capacity  building  for  SGES \nproduct  lending,  strengthening  of  client  selection  and  portfolio  management,  and  public \ninformation campaigns.  \n \n12. \nBenefits  to  women.  The  project  will  have  significant  benefits  for  women.  Introducing \nSGES such as energy-efficient cooking stoves, heating units and solar water heaters, and water \npurifiers  will  reduce  time  spent  in gathering firewood  and  other fuels for cooking,  heating,  and \nsafe  drinking  water,  and  increase  women\u2019s  borrowing  options.18\n SGES  enables  better  house-\n\n                                                \n14 A previous ADB project was instrumental in the creation of a sound microfinance system in Tajikistan.

Although  nascent,  a  few  SGES  solutions  are  currently \n13. \nassembled and manufactured locally through local cooperatives and skilled workers. By making \ncredit  and  information  available,  the  project  will  help  create  more  effective  demand.  This  will \nstimulate  growth  in  SGES  production  and  trade.  To  ensure  that  the  quality  and  service  being \ndelivered  by  the  private  sector  meet  appropriate  technical  standards,  the  project  will  provide \ninternational  and  national  experts  to  help  set  and  prioritize  quality  benchmarks  and  facilitate \nlocal cooperative links with other institutions that have relevant experience and knowledge. \n \nEnvironmental,  social,  and  other  benefits.  Use of SGES will result in improved local \n14. \nenvironmental and health benefits for rural households by substituting fossil and wood fuels with \nclean  alternatives  or  by  lowering  the  volumes  of  fossil  and  wood  fuels  used.  These  benefits \ninclude  reduced  exposure  to  indoor  air  pollution,  reduced  pressure  on  forestry  and  coal \nresources  to  meet  household  heating  and  cooking  needs,  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas \nemissions. Other benefits include reduced time spent by households to purchase, transport, and \nstore  diesel,  kerosene,  coal,  and  wood  in  remote  areas  for  power  generation,  heating,  and \ncooking; improved education opportunities for children during dark hours; and less eye strain as \na result of better household lighting.19 The project will enable (i) reduction of carbon emissions, \n(ii)  support  for  the  development  of  supply  chains  for  SGES,  and  (iii)  demonstration  of \nhouseholds\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  energy  solutions,  thereby  providing  a  baseline  for  pricing \nenergy produced by the formal power network.20\n \n \nStrategic fit and lessons. The project is consistent with the government\u2019s development \n15. \nobjectives and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which promotes inclusive and environmentally sustainable \ngrowth. 21 The project is included in the country operations business plan22 and will help develop \nTajikistan\u2019s  private  sector,  which  is  a  key  component  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy \n(footnote  16).  The  project  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  Energy  for  All  Initiative  to  develop  innovative \napproaches  to  affordable,  modern,  clean  energy  and  to  scale  up  the  use  of  energy-efficient \nproducts  for  poor  households.23\n The  project  reflects  good  design  practice  shown  in  an  earlier \nmicrofinance project in Tajikistan, particularly simplicity of design, involvement of more than one \nMFI in the project, and significant capacity building elements. (footnote 14). \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nThe impact will be increased energy efficiency in Tajik households. The outcome will be \n\n16. \nincreased access to finance for SGES in Tajikistan. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n17. \n \n\nThe outputs will be:   \n\n                                                \n19 A  2008  World  Bank  study  found  that  replacing  kerosene  lamps  with  electric  lighting  had  daily  health  benefits \nestimated  at  $2.50  per  household.

The PMU under the MOF will establish a Green \nFinance  Fund26 in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  MOF  and  ADB  will  lend  $8.8  million \nequivalent  in  somoni  to  eligible  MFIs  for  tenors  of  5  years,  at  an  interest  rate  equal  to  the \nNational Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) refinancing rate,27\n \n20. \nTo be eligible to participate, an MFI must (i) comply with capital adequacy requirements \nand  other  prudential  requirements  established  by  the  NBT;  (ii)  have  a  ratio  of  equity  to  total \nassets of not less than 12%; (iii) have a ratio of return on assets greater than zero; (iv) have a \nratio of return on equity of not less than 10%; (v) have a ratio of intermediation costs of less than \n33%; (vi) have a portfolio at risk over 30 days of less than 5%; (vii) have a write-off ratio of less \nthan 5%; (viii) have corporate, financial, management, and governance practices acceptable to \nADB  and  the  MOF;  (ix)  have  satisfied  ADB's  integrity,  anti-money-laundering,  and  counter-\nfinancing of terrorism due diligence requirements; and (x) have a demonstrated presence in low \nincome  urban  and rural areas.  An  MFI  that fails to meet  one  or  two  of  criteria  (ii)\u2013(vii)  but still \nhas strong implementation capabilities may be considered for participation if it submits an action \nplan to overcome the deficiency, as long as it complies with all other criteria. MFIs will also be \nrequired  to  submit  audited financial  statements for the  2  years  prior to entering  into  a  subloan \nagreement. \n \n21. \nThe MOF will enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the selected MFIs and ADB will \nenter  into  project  agreements  with  the  same  MFIs.  MFIs  will  make  loans  to  creditworthy \nhouseholds for the purchase and installation of SGES. These subloans to MFI borrowers, which \nwill be denominated in somoni in principal amounts of up to $5,000 equivalent for tenors of up to \n5 years, will bear interest at rates determined by the MFIs. The MOF will recycle the interest and \nprincipal payments made by MFIs back to the same or different eligible MFIs to enable them to \nmake additional loans for SGES.  \n \n22. \nDue  diligence  was  conducted  on  four  MFIs  that  expressed  interest  in  receiving  credit \nlines  under the  project: Arvand,  Humo, IMON  International,  and Oxus.  All four met the  agreed \nupon  eligibility  criteria. 28\n The  government,  with  ADB  concurrence,  has  selected  the  two  that \nhave existing SGES loan products\u2014Arvand and IMON International\u2014to receive 20% of the total \n\n                                                \n26 Green Finance Fund is the title of the imprest account for the credit line to MFIs. \n27 This rate is currently 6.5%.

The remaining 80% will be allocated by the PMU, subject to ADB \nconcurrence, to selected and eligible MFIs that express interest in participating in the project.29\n \n \n23. \nThe  MOF,  as  the  executing  agency,  has  created  the  PMU  to  monitor  the  project \ndeliverables  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The  MOF  will  also  establish  a  steering  committee \ncomprising  key  agencies  including  the  NBT,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Industry,  and  other \nrelevant stakeholders, to facilitate successful project implementation.30 This steering committee \nwill  meet  semiannually  to  review  the  project\u2019s  progress  and  advise  on  policy  matters. In  a key \ninnovation,  the  PMU  will  manage  funds  for  three  ADB  projects  with  microfinance  components \n(the  Access  to  Green  Finance  Project,  the  Rural  Development  Project, 31\n and  the  proposed \nBuilding  Climate  Resilience  in  the  Pyanj  River  Basin  Project)  on  a  cost-sharing  basis  and \ndevelop  skills  to  operate  as  a  long-term,  self-sustaining  fund.  MFIs  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies  for  the  credit  line  component.  Each  MFI  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU)  adequately  staffed  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  as  agreed  with  the  MOF.  Implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (footnote 29). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nOctober 2013\u2013December 2018  \n31 December 2018 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iii)  Implementation units \n\nProcurement \nConsulting Services \n \nDisbursement \n\nMOF \nMFIs  \nPIUs established by each MFI, 3\u20134 staff each \nShopping              Multiple contracts       $133,000 \n$466,800 \nNational\u2013ICS       \nNational\u2013LCS      \n$  75,000 \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended \nfrom time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB. \n\n756 person-months                      \nLump-suma \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ICS  =  individual  consultant  selection,  LCS  =  least  cost  selection,  MFI  = \nmicrofinance  institution,  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit,  PMU = project \nmanagement unit. \na For project audit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nProcurement waiver. In light of Tajikistan\u2019s extensive trade with non-ADB members and \n24. \nthe  relatively  small  size  of  individual  SGES  purchases  from  many  different  suppliers,  it  will  be \ndifficult  and  expensive  for  MFIs  to  ensure  that  all  procurement  of  equipment  and  goods  by \nsubborrowers originates in ADB member countries. For example, many energy-efficient wooden \ndoors  and  windows  manufactured  in  Tajikistan  (including  those  made  by  suppliers  in  GIZ\u2019s \nproject)  are  made  using  timber  sourced  from  non-ADB  countries  (principally  the  Russian \nFederation)  because  regionally  grown  timber  is  not  of  sufficient  quality.  Accordingly,  approval \nfrom ADB\u2019s Board of Directors is requested for procurement by subborrowers of equipment and \ngoods  from  non-member  countries  using  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  used  for  the  credit  line \n\n                                                \n29  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 The steering committee composition will be amended from time to time through a mutual agreement between the \n\nMOF and ADB during project implementation. \n\n31 ADB.  2005.

The MOF will be the executing agency. The TA will have a 5-year implementation period. \nThe TA grant will help improve stakeholders\u2019 capacity to implement the project and enhance the \nproject\u2019s sustainability. The impact will be increased access to green finance. The TA will have \nthree  outputs:  (i)  PMU  capacity  strengthened,  (ii)  public  awareness  campaign  on  SGES \ndeveloped  and  implemented,  and  (iii)  an  enabling  market  and  financing  framework  for  SGES \ndeveloped.  A  gender-sensitive  community  public  awareness  campaign  will  disseminate  the \ntechnical features and benefits of SGES. The PMU, MFIs, and other project stakeholders will be \nempowered to sustain the green finance market beyond the project implementation period. \n \n ADB  will  select  individuals  and  a  firm  for  consulting  services  to  provide  a  total  of \n26. \n85 person-months\u2019 consultancy (comprising 66 person-months\u2019 national and 19 person-months\u2019 \ninternational  consultancy).  The  firm  consultant  selection  shall  be  by  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection,  and  both  the  firm  and  individuals  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA resources \nwill  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

The  cost\u2013benefit  analysis \nestimates the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return at 16%. Sensitivity analysis showed that \nincreased costs and reduced benefits have low impact on the project\u2019s economic returns.34\n \n \nB. \n\nFinancial and Governance \n\n28. \nFinancial management, governance, and integrity due diligence was conducted on four \npotential  participating  MFIs  (para.  22)  to  ensure  market  capacity  to  engage  in  the  project.  All \nfour  MFIs  satisfied  ADB\u2019s  minimum  requirements.  They  have  in  place  acceptable  checks  and \nbalances  in  the  credit  approval  and  treasury  functions,  as  well  as  robust  internal  auditing \nprocedures.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 29). \n \nThe PMU will prepare and maintain financial statements required by ADB and will have \n30. \nthem audited in a timely manner by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. Except as \nprovided in para. 24, all procurement financed by the grant will be in accordance with applicable \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nTajikistan  is  among  the  poorest  countries  in  Central  Asia,  with  47%  of  the  population \nliving below the national poverty line and 73.5% of the population living in rural areas. Many of \nthe rural poor depend on remittances sent by their male family members from abroad. Tajikistan \nhas  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women  (20%)  because  of  high  numbers  of \nwidows  from  the  country's  civil  war  and  significant  male  outmigration.  Households  experience \nunreliable energy supply, especially in winter. The sample survey showed that both female- and \nmale-headed  households  are  equally  interested  in  SGES  and  are  willing  to  borrow  for  SGES. \nThe  project  will  address  issues  of  insufficient  knowledge  by  women,  affordability  of  SGES \ninvestment,  and \nthrough  cost-conscious  SGES  options, \nmicrofinance  lending  to  women,  capacity  building  for  all  stakeholders,  and  public  information \ncampaigns. \n \nD. \n\nimprovements \n\nSafeguards \n\nlivelihoods \n\nin \n\nADB  will  work  closely  with  the  MOF  and  the  MFIs  to  ensure  that  subloans  will  comply \n\n32. \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nThe  project  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  complies  with \n33. \nTajikistan\u2019s labor, environment, health, safety, and social laws and regulations. The project falls \nunder the financial intermediation category with respect to environmental and social safeguards \nand  is  treated  as  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nsubcategories.  It  will  have  minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  risks  and  will  not \ngenerate involuntary resettlement impacts or impacts on indigenous peoples within the meaning \nof  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Only  subprojects  classified  category  C  for  environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  will  be  financed  using  funds  obtained  under \nthe project\u2019s subloans. The prohibited investment activity list in the Safeguard Policy Statement \nwill  apply.  In  addition,  MFIs  whose  business  activities  involve  adverse  environmental  or  social \nimpacts  will  be  ineligible  to  participate.  Before  receiving  its  first  disbursement  under  the \nproposed  project,  each  MFI  will  be  required  to  establish  a  basic  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards management system with acceptable screening mechanisms.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe summary of risks and mitigating measures is provided in Table 4.  \n\n34. \n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSummary Risks \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nMacroeconomic Risks \n1.
