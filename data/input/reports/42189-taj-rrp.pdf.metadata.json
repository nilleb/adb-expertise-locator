An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \nconducted and is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nThe Nurek 500 kV Switchyard Reconstruction Project (the Project) \nwill build a new Nurek 500 kV switchyard on a new site within the \nNurek  Hydroelectric  Power  Plant  (HEPP)  complex  to  replace  the \nexisting  Nurek  500  kilovolt  (kV)  switchyard.  The  existing  500  kV \nequipment  will  be  dismantled  and  will  mostly  be  used  as  spare \nparts for other 500 kV substations.  \n \nNurek  HEPP,  incorporating  220  kV  and  500  kV  switchyards, \nproduces  over  70%  of  Tajikistan's  electricity  and  performs  a \nfrequency  regulation  role  for  the  Central  Asian  power  system, \nwhich  includes  the  electricity  systems  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n \nThe  existing  switchyards  were  built  more  than  30  years  ago  with \nSoviet technology and replacement parts are no longer available. \nThey are therefore in need of complete replacement.   \n \nSevere  subsidence  in  areas  of  the  switchyards  has  been \noccurring  for  many  years,  requiring  major  ongoing  remedial \nmeasures. This is due to an extensive salt dome in the vicinity of \nthe  switchyards  that  destabilizes  the  ground  conditions  during \nsnow  melt  and  rain.  There  are  risks  for  both  switchyards  that  a \ncatastrophic  event  may  occur  at  any  time,  thereby  destroying \nmajor parts of the switchgear. Ground stabilization measures are \nconsidered impractical.   \n \nThe  Government  of  Tajikistan  (the  Government)  considers  the \nreconstruction of the switchyards to be emergency projects due to \nthe  deteriorating  equipment  and  unstable  geological  site \nconditions  that  could  result  in  the  potential  loss  of  major  output \nfrom the Nurek HEPP for lengthy periods. \n \nA 2006 feasibility study recommended that the equipment in both \nswitchyards be retired, with new switchyards to be built on secure \nground. The study recommended that the least-cost option was to \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nutilize a portion of the land where the existing 220 kV switchyard \nis  currently  located  for  both  new  switchyards.  The  ground \nconditions  of  the  proposed  new  site  have  been  verified  as \nsatisfactory by geological investigation. \n \nGas-insulated  switchgear  technology,  which  uses  approximately \n10% of the area required by conventional air-insulated switchgear \ntechnology, is required due to the restricted area of the proposed \nnew site. \n \nThe  Government  signed  a  loan  agreement  with  the  German \nDevelopment Cooperation through  Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(Credit  Institute  for  Reconstruction)  in  August  2008  for  the \nfinancing of the new 220 kV gas-insulated switchgear switchyard, \nwith a projected completion date of April 2011. The Project under \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  will  complete  the \nrequired rehabilitation of the switchyards. \n \nThe impact is sustainable and reliable electricity supply to support \neconomic development. It will mitigate the risk of natural disasters \ndisabling  the  switchyard,  and  will  stabilize  the  flow  of  electricity \ncoming from the strategically important Nurek HEPP.  \n \nThe outcome is the reliable evacuation of Nurek HEPP electricity \nto the grid.    \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $66.90 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $9.4 million. \n \n\nTable 1: Tentative Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n \nA. \nB. \nC. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \nBase Cost \nContingencies \nFinancing Charges During Implementation \nTotal  \n\nEstimated \nAmount\n\n58.78 \n5.86 \n2.26 \n66.90 \n\nTable 2: Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmount \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment and Barki Tajika\nTotal \na   Barki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution of electricity in Tajikistan excluding Pamir \nregion. \n\n  Share (%) \n \n \n \n\n    54.77 \n    12.13 \n66.90 \n\n81.9 \n18.1 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n \n\n \n\nAllocation \nA  grant  of  $54.77  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources to the Government.   \n \nRelending \nThe Government will lend the proceeds of the grant to Barki Tajik \nunder a subsidiary loan agreement which will require Barki Tajik to \nrepay  the  loan  to  the  Government  at  an  interest  rate  of  5%  per \nannum over a tenor of 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. \n \nUse of Subsidiary Loan Repayments \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  receipt  of  repayments  of \nprincipal  and  interest  by  Barki  Tajik  arising  from  the  subsidiary \nloan  agreement  will  be  used  exclusively  for  Government  tariff \nsubsidies for poor and vulnerable electricity consumers.   \n \nThe Project will be implemented over a 5-year period commencing \nin  February  2009.  The  duration  of  the  turnkey  contract  will  be \napproximately  3  years,  including  the  1-year  guarantee  period \nbetween  the  taking  over  and  the  completion  of  the  warranty \nperiod. The estimated project completion date is 31 January 2014. \nThe period of utilization is until 31 July 2014. \n \nBarki Tajik Joint Stock Holding Company, the  100% state-owned \nand  vertically  integrated  power  utility  company  and  owner  of \nNurek HEPP. \n \nThe  Government  has  created  a  state  agency  to  act  as  an \nto  coordinate  and \nindependent  project  management  unit \nimplement  power  projects  that  are  funded  through  loans  and \ngrants \nfinancing \ninstitutions.

The design and monitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1.   \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nTajikistan possesses vast amounts of hydroelectric (40 gigawatts [GW]) and coal (3,600 \nmillion tons) energy resources, of which only a small fraction (less than 10% of the hydroelectric \nand negligible coal) has been developed. The power sector alone represents up to 5% of gross \ndomestic product and is a critical input for the main exports of cotton and aluminum. Meanwhile, \nthe  country  faces  energy  deficits  and  cannot  meet  its  winter  demand,  with  the  deficits  in  the \nwinter of 2007/2008 being particularly severe. \n\n3. \nTajikistan has an installed generation capacity of 4,326 megawatts (MW), of which 98% \nis hydroelectric power-based. The predominance of hydroelectric energy creates a problem as \nhydropower production exceeds demand in summer and is reduced in winter when glacial melt \nis least and demand is most. As a result, Tajikistan imports electricity and fossil fuels in winter to \nmeet energy needs, and has excess water during summer.   \n\n4. \nPer capita domestic energy consumption, at about 0.5 ton of oil equivalent, is very high \ngiven  the  country's  level  of  economic  development.  This  is  because  of  the  low  end-use \nefficiency and high heating requirements during winter. With the rise in prices of imported fuel, \nhouseholds have switched from organic fuels to electricity for heating and cooking, reflecting the \nfact that electricity is the only form of reliable energy available and the Government\u2019s below-cost \npricing policies have encouraged a shift to electricity away from other forms of energy. \n\n5. \nUntil  recently,  average  electricity  tariffs  were  considerably  below  cost-recovery  levels, \nwith  the  average  tariff  in  2006  of  $0.006  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  Since  2007,  Tajikistan  has \nimplemented three tariff increases and is on schedule to bring the average tariff to a financially \nviable level of $0.025/kWh (in 2008 terms) by  2010. In the gas sector, the current tariffs have \nbeen  increased  so  that  they  are  closer  to  the  financial  viability  levels.  Coal  prices  are  market \nbased. \n\nElectricity consumption in 2005 was 15 million gigawatt-hours (GWh), with the main user \n6. \ngroups  being  industry  (51%),  agriculture  (15%),  and  households  (28.2%),  and  with  Tajikistan \nAluminum  Company  (TALCO)  accounting  for  approximately  44.3%  of  total  industrial  use.  The \nhigh percentage usage by industry and agriculture reflects the subsidized nature of the tariffs to \nthese groups.   \n \n7. \nInvestments  in  the  power  sector  since  the  break-up  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  have \nbeen limited to emergency rehabilitation measures, a new 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission line, a \nmetering  project,  and  completion  of  the  Sangtuda  I  Hydroelectric  Power  Plant  (HEPP). \nMeanwhile, physical infrastructure continues to deteriorate, leading to high network losses and \nreduced reliability. In addition, commercial losses are high, partly due to the legacy of supplying \nenergy without meters and partly due to the lack of commercial orientation within the utilities.  \n\n8. \nBarki  Tajik  Joint  Stock  Holding  Company,  a  joint  stock  company  100%  owned  by  the \nstate, is a vertically integrated utility, consisting of a network of 10 subsidiary power generation \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ncompanies, 17 subsidiary distribution companies, and 4 supporting companies (such enterprise \nas  Energosnab  and  Repair-Mechanical  Plant).  It  serves  a  customer  base  of  approximately  1 \nmillion people and employed 11,200 staff in 2007.  \n \nTajikistan  has  not  appointed  an  independent  energy  regulator.  Instead,  the  Ministry  of \n9. \nEconomic  Development  and  Trade  regulates  the  prices  of  electricity,  natural  gas,  and  district \nheat,  while  the  Fuel  and  Energy  Department  in  the  Office  of  the  President  has  overall \nresponsibility for the energy sector. This arrangement is not in line with industry best practice, \nwith the Government holding both tariff setting and ownership functions. A sector and subsector \nanalysis is in Appendix 2.   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Power Sector Issues  \n\n10.  Winter  supply  deficit  continues  to  be  a  problem,  despite  import  of  electricity  from  the \nKyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Barki Tajik is implementing improved rationing \nprocedures  whereby  load  shedding  commences  earlier  in  the  season,  with  the  result  of \nimproved  supply  during  the  coldest  winter  months.  However,  solution  of  the  winter  deficit \nproblem will require new HEPPs with seasonal water storage capacity and/or additional thermal \ngeneration capacity.   \n \n11. \nElectricity  infrastructure  is  in  poor  technical  condition.  The  infrastructure  needs  to  be \nexpanded  to  cater  for  increased  demand  and  outdated  equipment  needs  to  be  replaced.  The \nProject  will  address  part  of  this  need  with  the  reconstruction  of  one  of  the  most  outdated  and \ncritical components of the system. \n \n12. \nThe Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, and Barki Tajik, have agreed on an \napproach to tariff rationalization and increase. Tariff categories have been reduced to six (albeit \nwith further subgroups) and favorable tariffs for low-usage customers and special summer and \nwinter  tariffs  for  TALCO  have  been  eliminated.  The  weighed  average  tariff  is  forecast  to  be \n$0.025/kWh  (in  2008  terms)  in  2010,  a  three  times  increase  of  the  average  tariff  from  2006. \nFollowing  the  most  recent  increase  in  July  2008,  the  weighted  average  tariff  is  $0.0017/kWh. \nNevertheless, further tariff rationalization and increases are required in order to eliminate cross \nsubsidies and fully cover Barki Tajik costs.   \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Industry  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  Government's \n13. \nenergy  policy.  The  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade  regulates  the  prices  of \nelectricity, natural gas, and district heat. The Ministry of Environmental Protection is responsible \nfor environmental regulation of energy operations. The Committee on State Property exercises \nownership functions over state-owned assets. The practice of the Government holding both tariff \nsetting  and  ownership  functions  is  not  in  line  with  industry  best  practice.  This  institutional \nframework does not reflect the needs of a market-oriented economy. \n \nThe state-owned Barki Tajik is in need of major restructuring. Its organizational structure \n14. \ndoes  not  reflect  modern  utility  practice,  while  the  company  itself  is  in  poor  financial  condition \nfollowing years of below-cost tariffs, high losses, and poor collection rates. Barki Tajik needs to \nbe reorganized to reflect the commercial nature of its business.   \n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n 3\n\nDespite  having  abundant  electricity  generation  potential, \n\nincluding  some  partly \n15. \ncompleted  hydropower  resources  and  power  deficit  markets  in  neighboring  countries,  the \ncountry is not optimally exploiting its export potential. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n16. \ndomestic and export markets, as follows:  \n \n\nIn  2005,  the  Government  developed  a  strategy  based  on  a  two-track  approach  for  the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThe  first  track  focuses  on  meeting  the  demand  of  the  domestic  market,  and \ncomprises a set of policy and investment measures aimed to bring the sector to \nreasonable  operating  conditions  and  improve  its  financial  viability.  The  policy \nmeasures  include  (a)  the  implementation  of  a  medium-term  tariff  policy;  (b)  a \nsocial  protection  policy  for  energy  services  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the \nscheme  and  ensure  a  more  targeted  approach  to  support  the  poor;  and  (c)  an \ninstitutional reform policy for the energy sector to improve the transparency and \nefficiency  of  operations,  enable  electricity  trade,  and  pave  the  way  for  private \nsector  participation \ninclude \nimplementation of programs for (a) increased energy efficiency; (b) demand-side \nmanagement, including a heat supply strategy; and (c) increasing energy supply \nto meet winter demand, with focus on rehabilitation of existing assets.  \n\ninvestment  measures \n\nthe  sector.  The \n\nin \n\nThe  second  track  focuses  on  increasing  electricity  exports  by  (a)  using  existing \nseasonal surpluses in the summer, and (b) attracting private sector investors to \njoin  in  developing  newer  hydroelectric  and  thermal  capacities  for  exports  to \nneighboring and regional countries.   \n\n \n\n3. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy \n\n17. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  strategy  for  the  energy  sector  in  Tajikistan  is  to \nensure  that  domestic  energy  demands  are  met  from  a  sustainable  and  viable  industry  and  to \nassist in the development of country\u2019s considerable hydropower export potential. This strategy is \nto  be  achieved  through  (i)  improvements  in  the  sector\u2019s  institutional  structure,  operational \nefficiency,  and  financial  performance;  and  (ii)  support  in  the  development  of  regional  energy \ntrade  projects.  This  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Long-term  Strategic  Framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020)1 where support of infrastructure development and regional cooperation are core \nareas.  The Project is not included in the current country partnership strategy for Tajikistan but \nhas been added in ADB\u2019s 2008 country assistance program following the Government\u2019s request \non 16 July 2008. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n18. \nNurek  HEPP  produces  over  70%  of  Tajikistan's  electricity  and  performs  a  frequency \nregulation role for the Central Asian power system.2 Reliable operation of Nurek HEPP is critical \nto  meet  Tajikistan  electric  supply  requirements  and  is  an  important  aspect  of  Central  Asian \nPower System operation.   \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  2008\u20132020. \n\n2   Central  Asian  power  system  includes  the  networks  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Turkmenistan,  and \n\nManila. \n\nUzbekistan. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  existing  switchyards  use  obsolete  Soviet  technology  for  which  replacement  parts \n19. \nare no longer available. The equipment in both switchyards has exceeded its useful life and is in \nneed  of  complete  replacement.  In  the  absence  of  equipment  replacement,  the  availability  of \nboth switchyards will deteriorate in the coming years, thereby curtailing Nurek HEPP output.   \n \n20. \nNurek  HEPP,  situated  75  kilometers  east  of  Dushanbe,  the  capital  of  Tajikistan,  was \ncommissioned in 1972 and produces 11,200 GWh within an average hydrological year. Nurek \nhas nine generator and turbine units with total installed capacity of 3,000 MW. Six generator and \nturbine  units  are  connected  to  the  Nurek  500  kV  switchyard  and  three  to  the  Nurek  220  kV \nswitchyard.  Both  switchyards  currently  use  air-insulated  switchgear  (AIS)  and  are  in  separate \nlocations within the Nurek HEPP complex.  \n \nSevere subsidence in areas of the 500 kV and 220 kV switchyards has been occurring \n21. \nfor  many  years,  requiring  major  ongoing  remedial  measures.  This  is  due  to  an  extensive  salt \ndome  in  the  vicinity  of  the  switchyards  that  destabilizes  the  ground  conditions  during  times  of \nsnow melt and rain. There are risks for both switchyards that a catastrophic event may occur at \nany time, thereby destroying major parts of the switchgear. Ground stabilization measures are \nconsidered impractical. There are also regular landslides in the immediate vicinity of the 500 kV \nsite, making the location yet more unattractive for an electrical installation.   \n \nThe Government considers the reconstruction of the 220 kV and 500 kV switchyards to \n22. \nbe emergency projects due to the deteriorating equipment, unstable geological site conditions, \nand the potential for loss of major portions of Nurek HEPP output for lengthy periods. \n \nA  2006  feasibility  study  conducted  by  consulting  engineers  Fichtner  of  Germany \n23. \nrecommended that the equipment in both switchyards be retired with new switchyards to be built \non secure ground. The study examined various alternative sites for the new switchyards. Such \nalternatives were limited due to the mountainous location and the salt dome footprint. The study \nconcluded that the least-cost option was to utilize a portion of the existing 220 kV switchyard for \nboth new switchyards, with the ground conditions of the proposed new site having been verified \nas  satisfactory  by  geological  investigation.  Gas-insulated  switchgear  (GIS)  technology,  which \nuses  approximately  10%  of  the  area  required  by  AIS  technology,  is  required  due  to  the \nrestricted area of the proposed new site. \n \n24. \nThe Government signed a loan agreement with the German Development Cooperation \nthrough  Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (Credit  Institute  for Reconstruction)  in  August  2008  for \nthe financing of the new 220 kV GIS switchyard with a projected completion date of April 2011. \nThe Project under ADB financing will complete the required rehabilitation of the switchyards. \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n25. \nThe first track of the Government\u2019s strategy\u2014to focus on the domestic market\u2014is being \nsupported  by  the  multilateral  and  bilateral  donor  community  through  a  range  of  rehabilitation \nprojects  (Appendix  3).  The  proposed  Nurek  500  kV  Switchyard  Reconstruction  Project,  which \nwill enable continued electricity supply to Tajikistan, is consistent with this strategy. On 16 July \n2008, the Government requested ADB\u2019s financial assistance to implement the Project.   \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n 5\n\nADB-funded technical assistance (TA)  3 is assisting the Ministry of Energy and Industry \n26. \nin preparing options for the restructuring of Barki Tajik, and in implementing the options, with TA \ncompletion due in 2010. A United States Trade and Development Agency-funded study, due to \ncommence at the end of 2008, will examine the viability of commercial coal mine developments, \nfor  which  a  thermal  power  plant  would  be  a  potential  customer.  Sangtuda1  HEPP  (670  MW \ncapacity),  70%  owned  by  RAO  UES  of  Russia  and  30%  by  the  Government,  is  under \nconstruction, with full capacity operation scheduled for 2009.   \n\nFollowing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Meeting in Tajikistan in August 2008, \n27. \nthe  governments  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Russian  Federation  signed \nagreements with the Government of Tajikistan to finance four new HEPPs, three of which will be \nfinanced  by  the  Russian  Federation  (the  largest  with  a  capacity  of  250  MW)  and  one  by  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (with a 200 MW capacity).   \n\n28. \nTajikistan continues to promote the development of Rogun HEPP (3,600 MW capacity), \nconstruction  of  which  started  during  the  Soviet  era  but  has  since  been  suspended.  A  World \nBank-funded feasibility study is due to commence in late 2008. This major project would serve \nthe  dual  purposes  of  meeting  Tajikistan's  winter  demand  and  allowing  Tajikistan  to  export  the \nconsiderable surplus energy.   \n\nThe second track of the Government\u2019s strategy\u2014to focus on the export market\u2014is being \n29. \nimplemented  with  (i)  the  signing  of  ADB  loans4  for  construction  of  the  Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan \ntransmission interconnection, and (ii) the ongoing development of the Central Asia\u2013South Asia \nregional electricity market5 (CASAREM) project, which envisages the building of a high voltage \ntransmission interconnection to allow electricity exports from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nto Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of which are energy deficient.   \n\n6. \n\nLessons \n\nDelays were experienced in the implementation of early ADB projects due to project staff \n30. \nbeing  unfamiliar  with  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  inexperienced  with  international \nprojects.  However,  the  proposed  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  learned  from  its \nexperiences and its implementation of ongoing ADB-assisted projects is satisfactory.   \n \n31. \nPrevious loan covenants requiring the introducing of cost-recovery tariffs have not been \nfully implemented due to resistance from poor and vulnerable customers who have difficulty in \npaying  the  existing  low  tariffs.  The  project  design  addresses  this  issue  by  requiring  the \nGovernment  to  use  the  subsidiary  loan  repayments  to  subsidize  targeted  customers  while \nensuring that Barki Tajik raises its tariff to a full cost-recovery level.   \n \n32. \nBarki Tajik is weak in nontechnical areas of governance, human resource management, \nfinancial controls, and commercial awareness. Reform is proving to be a slow process, with the \nGovernment and Barki Tajik being generally resistant to change. However, the Government has \nnow indicated its intention to proceed with the delayed restructuring of Barki Tajik.   \n                                                 \n3 ADB.  2006.

ADB  design  of  regional  trade  projects  have  reflected  this  stage  of \ndevelopment  by  requiring  the  trading  parties  to  finalize  commercial  agreements  as  a \nprecondition before release of development funds.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n34. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  and  reliable  electricity  supply  to  support \neconomic development. It will mitigate the risk of natural disasters disabling the switchyard, and \nwill  stabilize  the  flow  of  electricity  coming  from  the  strategically  important  Nurek  HEPP.  The \noutcome of the Project is the reliable evacuation of Nurek HEPP electricity to the grid.  \n  \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n35. \nThe Project output is the building of a new Nurek 500 kV switchyard on a new site within \nthe Nurek Hydroelectric Power Plant (HEPP) complex, which will replace the existing Nurek 500 \nkilovolt  (kV)  switchyard.  The  existing  500  kV  equipment  will  be  dismantled  and  will  mostly  be \nused  as  spare  parts  for  other  500  kV  substations.  Old  metals  will  be  sold  to  local  recycling \ncompanies. The new Nurek 500 kV switchyard will utilize GIS technology, which only requires \napproximately 10% of the area required by AIS technology used in the existing switchyards.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n36. \nCurrent  Barki  Tajik  tariff  methodology  employs  rates  that  are  below  the  long-run \nmarginal cost and incorporates cross subsidies between different consumer categories. This is \ninconsistent  with  international  best  utility  practice  whereby  tariffs  should  cover  costs  without \ncross  subsidies.  In  the  event  that  the  Government  identifies  a  particular  consumer  class  that \nrequires a subsidy, this should be funded directly by the Government in a transparent manner.  \n \n37. \nIn  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  strategy,  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  tariffs  are  to  be  increased \nsuch  that  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  future  income  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  costs,  repay  debt,  and  provide \nadequate return on equity investments. As Barki Tajik will perform as a commercial company, it \nshould therefore not in itself be the recipient of the ADB grant.  \n \n38. \nADB  will  provide  the  project  funds to  the  Government  through  a  grant  agreement.  The \nGovernment  will  then  lend  the  Government\u2019s  share  and  ADB\u2019s  share  of  the  Project  funds  to \nBarki Tajik through a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to ADB. Barki Tajik repayments to \nthe Government of the principal and interest arising from this subsidiary loan agreement will be \nused exclusively to subsidize the poor and vulnerable electricity consumers in accordance with \na methodology agreed with ADB and reflected in such subsidiary loan agreement. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $66.9  million  (Table  1).  A  detailed \n\n39. \nproject investment plan by cost category is in Appendix 4. \n \n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n 7\n\nTable 1: Tentative Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \nB. \n\n \nBase Cost \nContingencies \n\nC. \n\nFinancing Charges During Implementation \n\nTotal  \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nEstimated Amount\n58.78 \n5.86 \n\n2.26 \n\n66.90 \n\n40. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $54.77  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance the Project. The Government and Barki Tajik will provide counterpart \nfunding of $12.1 million for taxes and duties, which may take the form of exemption, and also for \nproject support and interest.  \n \n\nTable 2: Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment and Barki Tajik \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n54.77 \n12.13 \n66.90 \n\nShare (%) \n81.9 \n18.1 \n100.0 \n\n \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Revising  the  Framework  for  Asian  Development  Fund  Grants 6  was \n41. \napproved by the Board on 26 September 2007. The paper provided that, for countries eligible \nfor  grant  assistance,  the  percentage  of  ADB  financing  on  a  grant  basis  in  the  country  will  be \nbased  on  such  country\u2019s  debt  distress  classification.  Tajikistan  is  classified  as  a  country  with \nhigh  risk  of  debt  distress  and  therefore  is  eligible  to  receive  its  Asian  Development  Fund \nallocation on a 100% grant basis. \n \n42. \nIt has been agreed with the Government that it will lend the ADB grant proceeds to Barki \nTajik at an interest rate of 5% per annum at a tenor of 25 years including a 5-year grace period \nand with the foreign exchange risk bourne by Barki Tajik. Interest and repayment proceeds from \nBarki Tajik to the Government will be used to subsidize tariffs for the poor.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n43. \nBarki Tajik shall be the Executing Agency (EA). As approved by the resolution number \n283 dated July 2006, the Government has created a state body to act as an independent PMU \nto  coordinate  and  implement  power  projects  that  are  funded  through  loans  and  grants  from \nbilateral donors and international financing institutions. Barki Tajik shall employ the services of \nthe  PMU  for  day-to-day  management  of  the  Project.  The  PMU  has  been  performing \nsatisfactorily in the implementation of ongoing ADB-assisted projects. \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n44. \nThe Project will be implemented over a 5-year period commencing in February 2009, of \nwhich  the  turnkey  contract  duration  will  be  approximately  3  years,  including  the  1-year \nguarantee  period  between  the  taking  over  and  the  completion  of  the  warranty  period.  The \nimplementation  consultant  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  during  the  pre-\nconstruction  phase  of  the  Project  and  submit  it  to  the  EA  and  ADB.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\nfor  eligible  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows \n\nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  Management  has,  in  principle,  approved \n45. \nadvance  contracting \nthe \nGovernment  to  commence  procurement  activities,  at  its  own  risk,  prior  to  signing  of  the  grant \nagreement,  but  does  not  allow  for  the  award  of  contract  until  after  the  grant  has  become \neffective. The Government was informed that such advance contracting (including advertising) \nmust  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government \nand Barki Tajik have been informed that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB \nto finance the Project. \n   \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\nOne  turnkey  contract  for  the  entire  Project  will  be  procured  by  Barki  Tajik  using \n46. \ninternational  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  An \nindicative procurement plan is presented in Appendix 6. The procurement plan will be updated \nat least annually, covering the next 18 months of procurement activity. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n47. \nOne  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  as  the  implementation  consultant.  The  consultant \nwill be selected and engaged by Barki Tajik in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Modified quality- and cost-based selection method with weighting of 90:10 will be \nadopted,  since  the  consequences  of  poor  performance  could  be  high,  leading  to  catastrophic \neconomic,  financial,  and  social  losses.  A  total  of  85  person-months  of  inputs,  mostly  by \ninternational consultants, will be required over the consulting service duration of approximately 3 \nyears. The provisions of consulting services are summarized in the indicative procurement plan \nin Appendix 6. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 11. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n48. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Barki  Tajik.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  Barki  Tajik  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n 9\n\n \n49. \nprojects.  \n \n\nBarki Tajik will establish a website that will present information on all externally funded \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n50. \nGrant funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time), using direct payment procedures for the turnkey contract \nand consulting services. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nBarki  Tajik  shall  maintain  its  financial  statements  in  double-entry  accrual  accounting  in \n51. \naccordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) followed in Tajikistan.7 \nIts  financial  statements  shall  comprise  its  balance  sheet,  income  statement,  and  cash  flow \nstatement  accompanied  by  their  respective  schedules  and  notes  to  accounts  as  may  be \nnecessary.  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  financial  statements  shall  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with \nInternational  Standards  of  Auditing  by  an  external  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Barki  Tajik \nannual  financial  statement  shall  be  accompanied  by  the  auditor's  letter  to  Barki  Tajik \nmanagement  and  management\u2019s  response  to  it.  Most  importantly,  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  external \nauditor's  report  will  contain  the  auditor's  opinion  on  whether  ADB\u2019s  grant  funds  were  used  for \nthe purposes specified in ADB\u2019s grant and project agreements. Barki Tajik will submit to ADB its \naudited annual reports in English within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n \nBarki Tajik will maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the \n52. \ngoods and services financed from the grant funds, financing resources received, expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. These project accounts and financial statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. External auditors for the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Barki Tajik will submit to ADB the audited project annual \nreports in English within 6 months of the close of every fiscal year. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n53. \nThe  quarterly  progress  reports  prepared  by  Barki  Tajik  will  include  (i)  a  narrative \ndescription of progress made during the period (progress on compliance with environmental and \nsocial  requirements,  including  the  environmental  management  plan  and  resettlement  plan,  if \nany); (ii) changes in the implementation schedule; (iii) problems or difficulties encountered; and \n(iv)  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  next  period.  The  progress  reports  should  also  have  a  list  of \ncritical decisions required from Government, ADB, and the Barki Tajik board in the next quarter. \nThe progress reports will also include a summary financial account for the Project, consisting of \nproject  expenditures  during  the  period,  total  expenditure  to  date,  and  benefit  monitoring  in \naccordance with procedures and details acceptable to ADB. Performance will be evaluated on \nthe basis of indicators and targets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   Where  for  any  particular  disclosure  the  prevailing  accounting  standard  in  Tajikistan  differs  from  the  International \nFinancial Reporting Standards, the financial statements shall, in a note to the accounts, explain the divergence. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n54. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  after  the  grant  effectiveness,  and  regular  annual \nreview missions to discuss the latest progress and address current and emerging problems by \ndeveloping  mitigating  measures.  ADB,  together  with  the  Government  and  Barki  Tajik,  will \nundertake an in-depth midterm review of the Project 2 years after grant effectiveness to assess \nwhether  the  Project  outcome  and  outputs  are  likely  to  be  achieved.  The  midterm  review  will \nfocus on institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, \nfinancial, and other aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its \ncontinuing viability. \n \nG. \n\nExecuting Agency   \n\n1. \n\nCorporate Overview \n\n55. \nBarki Tajik, the Executing Agency, is the state-owned utility responsible for generation, \ntransmission, and distribution of electricity in Tajikistan. Prior to the country\u2019s independence, it \nwas  administratively  a  Government  entity.  In  1992,  Barki  Tajik  became  a  state  joint  stock \nholding company. Although it is fully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys autonomous \nstatus according to its charter. In 2000, Barki Tajik was incorporated as a commercial entity, and \na formal separation of operations has taken place along its business lines. In 2004, Barki Tajik \nwas merged with the Ministry of Energy and Industry. In March 2006, this merger was revoked \nand Barki Tajik separated from the Ministry of Energy and Industry. \n \nBarki  Tajik  is  managed  by  a  chair  and  a  board  of  directors  appointed  by  the \n56. \nGovernment. Ten general services departments (among them planning, accounting, and sales) \nreport directly to the Barki Tajik chair, who also manages issues of great importance, such as \nthe  power  supply  contract  with  TALCO  (the  largest  industrial  consumer  with  40%  of  total \nconsumption), or the financing of new investment projects. The overall staff of the utility totals \n11,480 people, of which about 290 work in the head office in Dushanbe. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n57. \nFinancial management assessment has been carried out to evaluate Barki Tajik\u2019s ability \nto  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements.  Financial  management  of  Barki  Tajik  was  found  to  be \nadequate.  The  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  was  used  to  review  current \npractice. With assistance of ADB TA (footnote 3), Barki Tajik is in transition and the assessment \nwas designed to determine its potential to achieve financial and operational independence. The \nreview  identified  issues  and  constraints  and  made  recommendations  to  improve  budgeting, \naccounting, internal controls, audit, and legislative compliance to ensure that Barki Tajik\u2019s funds \nare efficiently and effectively utilized. \n \n58. \nBarki Tajik is still receiving subsidies from the Government due to no tariff increases for \nthe  past  few  years.  As  agreed  with  donors,  the  Government  approved  a  4-year  plan  of \nincreasing  tariffs  where  Barki  Tajik  should  be  able  to  achieve  full  cost-recovery  by  2010. \nFurther,  tariff  increases  thereafter  are  needed  for  Barki  Tajik  to  be  able  to  self-finance  its \ninvestment plan.  \n \n\n  \n\n\f3. \n\nPast Financial Performance \n\n \n\n 11\n\n59. \nThe  consolidated  income  statement  reveals  sales  revenue  growth  during  the  last  few \nyears. Total revenues increased from TJS217 million ($63.47 million) in 2003 to TJS379 million \n($110.85  million)  in  2007.  As  sales  in  terms  of  kWh  have  been  consistent  for  this  period \n(annually  around  13,500  GWh),  two  other  factors  can  be  attributed  to  this  increase.  First,  as \ntariffs  were  constant  from  2003  to  2006  (TJS0.0016/kWh  for  residential  consumers),  the \nincrease  in  revenues  can  be  attributed  to  improved  collection  and  customer  management. \nCollection  rates  improved  from  83%  in  2003  to  94%  in  2006  (2007  figures  are  not  available). \nSecondly,  the  revenue  increase  from  2006  to  2007  (35%)  can  be  attributed  to  the  increase  in \ntariffs (TJS0.0024/kWh in 2007). \n \nAccounts receivable remain a major problem, despite efforts to improve collections in the \n60. \npast  few  years.  The  largest  debtors  in  2006  were  TALCO  (TJS81  million)  and  the  Ministry  of \nMelioration  and  Water  Economy  (TJS41  million).  A  specific  approach  to  TALCO  and  irrigation \npumping has to be developed with the help of the Ministry of Melioration and Water Economy in \norder to improve the payment discipline of the customers. Barki Tajik should be more persistent \nin  resolving  the  issue  of  the  long-term  debt  of  TALCO  through  finding  efficient  means  to \nstimulate  the  company  to  respect  past  agreements  and  to  start  repaying  debts.  International \nfinancial  institution  covenants  have  continued  to  pressure  Barki  Tajik  to  improve  (and/or  write \noff) accounts receivable from TALCO and other debtors.  \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\nCost recovery is assumed, with tariff increases approved to 2010 ($0.0182/kWh in 2009 \n61. \nand  $0.025/kWh  in  2010).  In  order  for  the  assumed  investment  program  to  be  sustainable, \ntariffs will be further increased to $0.030/kWh in 2014 and $0.040/kWh in 2016. With collections \nimproving  to  90%  in  2016  from  the  current  80%,  it  is  projected  that  there  will  be  a  gradual \nimprovement in Barki Tajik\u2019s financial performance and position during the planning period from \n2009 to 2033. \n \n62. \nThe projections have been designed so that Barki Tajik will be a self-sustainable entity \nwithout any support from the Government. The results show that total revenues are expected to \nincrease  from  $203  million  in  2009  to  $2,023  million  in  2033,  and  Barki  Tajik  is  projected  to \nmake  a  reasonable  profit  annually  (with  an  average  15%  profit  margin).  Cash  available  over \ndebt service is also projected to be greater than debt payments for the span of the projections. \nBarki Tajik is currently able to generate 17,493 GWh using its own resources and is not able to \nsupply total domestic demand (assumed at 19,000 GWh for 2009). In addition, the projections \nassume a 2.5% increase in demand starting in 2012. The deficit and future increase in demand \nwill  be  covered  by  hydropower  and  thermal  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  coming  on \nline, starting in 2009. The projections have assumed Barki Tajik will purchase hydropower from \nthe IPPs for $0.035/kWh escalated at 5% per annum, and thermal (starting in 2016) power for \n$0.070/kWh  with  the  same  escalation  factor.  Moreover,  Barki  Tajik  is  estimated  to  undergo \napproximately $1 billion rehabilitation and new capital expenditure program over the next 10\u201315 \nyears. In order to sufficiently cover such capital expenditure and its daily operations, including \npower  purchases  from  the  IPPs,  average  tariffs  to  consumers  are  projected  to  increase  from \n$0.018/kWh in 2009 to $0.080/kWh in 2033, an average increase of 7.3% per annum.  \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits  \n\nFinancial Benefits. Financial analysis of the Project was carried out in accordance with \n63. \nADB guidelines.8 All financial costs and benefits were expressed at constant 2008 prices. Cost \nstreams used to determine the financial internal rate of return\u2014i.e. capital investment, operation \nand  maintenance,  insurance  costs,  and  taxes\u2014reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated \nbenefits. The wheeling charges were computed from the current approved tariffs and have been \nused  on  an  annually  fixed  basis  to  estimate  the  revenue,  while  incremental  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  9.3%  compares  favorably  with  the \n64. \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 2.54%, indicating financial viability of the Project. \nFinancial  viability  was  gauged  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  with-  and \nwithout-project  investment  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  from  the  availability  of \npower  through  the  transmission  system  due  to  the  improved  substation,  whereas  the  without-\nproject  scenario  foresees  a  deterioration  of  the  assets  leading  to  increasing  operational  costs \nand constraints in transmitting the generated electricity to the transmission line. Nonquantifiable \nbenefits  such  as  geological  incidents  were  not  included  in  the  financial  evaluation.  Summary \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 10. \n \n65. \nFor both the financial and economic analyses, with- and without-project scenarios have \nbeen  modeled  to  compare  the  overall  net  benefits  of  the  Project.  The  major  benefits  are \nidentified as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nLess outages and better reliability. The relocation and/or reconstruction of the \nswitchyards  does  not  lead  to  increased  energy  generation,  and  thus  does  not \ngenerate  incremental  increase  in  revenues.  However,  the  Project  secures  the \nfuture  flow  of  revenue  to  Barki  Tajik.  If  the  switchyard  is  not  reconstructed,  the \nexisting  switchyard  will  gradually  break  down,  disrupt  the  energy  supply  from \nNurek  HEPP,  and  result  in  a  loss  of  revenue  from  energy  sales.  Thus,  the \nsecured revenue from future energy generation may be attributed to the Project. \n\nElimination  of  geological  avoidance  and  related  costs.  Although  geological \nevents are an issue with the existing switchyard (both landslide and subsidence \nof the existing switchyard site), due to the unpredictability of geological events no \nanalysis has been done with regard to a hypothetical landslide and subsidence. \nHowever,  for  the  without-project  scenario,  subsidence  prevention  costs  have \nbeen included initially at $30,000 in 2009, escalating by a factor of $50,000 per \nannum  due  to  the  increased  difficulties  of  prevention  measures  year  after  year. \nAs the Project will be moved to a different location, the investment scenario does \nnot include this cost as there is no subsidence. \n\n \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  Project  is  least  cost.  It  is  a  part  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  integrated \n66. \ngeneration  and  transmission  expansion  plan,  and  an  integrated  component  of  providing \nTajikistan\u2019s  major  source  of  generation  using  least-cost  planning  principles.  The  economic \nanalysis  was  based  on  a  time-slice  approach  to  the  Project.  The  Project  will  stabilize \ntransmission of the majority of Tajikistan\u2019s electricity generation to the population. Cost\u2013benefit \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.  Manila. \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n 13\n\nprojections were  prepared  and  analyzed  by  the  Project,  and  it  was  judged  to  be  economically \nviable. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 7. \n \n67. \nThe economic internal rate of return was estimated at 36.7% based on the incremental \ncost\u2013benefit  streams  associated  with  the  Project.  Economic  performance  was  evaluated  by \ncomparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios. The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  compares \nthe  annual  streams  of  economic  capital  and  operating  costs  against  the  benefits,  based  on \nwillingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2009 constant prices. The \nanalysis  period  includes  the  construction  and  operation  period  equal  to  40  years.  The  main \nbenefit stems from the incremental energy provided to the population assuming that, without the \nProject,  the  switchyard  would  have  to  continuously  be  off  line  for  repair  and  subsidence \nprevention works. Economic benefits accrue to consumers and the economy as a result of the \nProject.  Incremental  consumption  occurs  because  of  the  stable  availability  of  adequate  and \nreliable power supplies. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\n68. \nThe Project does not entail land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) and does not involve \nindigenous  peoples.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  category  C  both  in  terms  of  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  impact.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is presented in Appendix 8. \n \n69. \nThe  Project  will  result  in  approximately  50  new  skilled  and  unskilled  temporary  jobs \nbeing  created  for  construction.  Adherence  to  ADB's  core  labor  standards9  and  the  Labor  Law \n(1997) of Tajikistan will be included in the Grant Agreement and the bidding documents for the \nturnkey contract. Requirement for education on HIV/AIDS and prohibition of child labor will also \nbe indicated in the Grant Agreement and the bidding documents. These items will be monitored \nby the PMU and will be reported to ADB through periodical progress reports.  \n \n70. \nThe Project is not expected to deliver direct benefits to the poor since the Project is the \nreconstruction of an existing switchyard that evacuates generated power of Nurek HEPP to the \nnational grid. The Project will ensure stable and reliable supply of power that will contribute to \nthe development of the national economy. Given that Nurek HEPP is responsible for over 70% \nof the electricity generated in Tajikistan, the Project is expected to result in indirect benefits to \nthe majority of the population of Tajikistan, including the poor. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n71. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  category  B  in  terms  of  environmental  impact.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  report  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Environment \nPolicy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).10 The IEE confirmed that only \nminor impacts are expected during the construction phase of the Project. All construction works \nof  the  new  switchyard  and  dismantling  of  the  old  switchyard  takes  place  within  the  fenced \ncompound of the Nurek HEPP, which has been in operation for over 30 years. The construction \nworks  involve  disposal  of  spoil.  The  spoil  bank  is  located  just  outside  the  Nurek  HEPP \ncompound  in  an  area  which  was  once  the  borrow  area  for  excavating  materials  for  the \nconstruction  of  the  dam  body.  Barki  Tajik  has  been  granted  the  land-use  rights,  and  the  area \nhas been used until very recently as a spoil bank to deposit dredged materials from downstream \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2006.

Most of the parts and materials generated from dismantling of the existing \nswitchyard  will  be  used  as  spares  in  other  500  kV  substations,  and  old  metals  (steel,  copper, \nand aluminum) will be sold to local recycling companies. \n \nThe  IEE  report  contains  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  and  an \n72. \nindicative  budget  for  the  purchasing  of  monitoring  devices.  The  IEE  will  be  updated  by  the \nturnkey  contractor  once  the  detailed  design  is  completed.  No  civil  works  will  be  permitted  to \ncommence  until  the  updated  IEE  is  approved  by  ADB.  The  summary  IEE  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \nD. \n\nProject Risks and Assumptions \n\nThe  Project  is  technically  complicated  given  its  advanced  technology  content  and  the \n73. \nneed  for  the  two  new  switchyards  to  be  integrated  both  with  each  other  and  with  the  existing \npower station. However, the overall technical risk is deemed to be low based on \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ntechnical-financial \n\nimplementation  consultant  being  selected  using  a \n\nthe probability of repeat of poor ground conditions at the new site location being \nremote, as a detailed geological survey confirming the suitability of the new site \nwas carried out during the feasibility study stage; \nthe \nweighting of 90:10, thereby putting a high emphasis on quality; \nthe  existing  PMU,  which  has  experience  on  similar  donor-funded  projects, \nimplementing the Project; \ntechnically and economically viable bids, which are expected following consultant \ninteraction with potential bidders during the feasibility study stage; \nbidder  qualification  criteria  that  will  ensure  that  only  competent  and  proven \ncontractors are eligible to bid; \nparallel  implementation  of  a  related  220  kV  switchyard  project,  which  is  on \nschedule  with  signing  of  loan  agreement  and  selection  of  implementation \nconsultant having been completed; and \nimplementation  risk  of  the  500  kV  project  being  minimized,  with  the  proposed \nselection of a turnkey contractor who will have single overall responsibility. \n\n \n74. \nRehabilitation  of  the  nine  turbine  and  generators  of  Nurek  HEPP  is  not  included  in  the \nProject  but  will  need  to  be  carried  out  in  the  medium  term.  It  is  assumed  that  total  failure  of \nNurek HEPP will not occur as the nine units operate independently of each other and any one \nunit  can  be  repaired  and  rehabilitated  at  the  time  of  failure,  as  has  been  recent  practice. \nMeanwhile,  the  Government  is  seeking  funds  in  the  amount  of  $300  million  to  rehabilitate  the \nnine turbine and generators. The Nurek dam structure is in good condition and is not in need of \nrehabilitation.   \n \n75. \nAt  a  policy  level,  it  is  assumed  that  the  Government  will  implement  full  cost-recovery \ntariffs.  The  project  facilitates  such  a  policy  through  the  requirement  that  repayments  by  Barki \nTajik  to  the  Government  of  the  subsidiary  loan  will  be  used  exclusively  to  support  poor  and \nvulnerable  electricity  consumers.  It  is  also  assumed  that  the  Government  is  committed  to \nmaking available the necessary investments to rehabilitate and develop the electricity sector.  \n \n76. \nAt  an  institutional  level,  it  is  assumed  that  Barki  Tajik  will  (i)  implement  needed  reform \nwith  the  modernization  of  its  governance  and  corporate  procedures,  and  (ii)  deliver  on  its \nassurances  to  improve  collection  levels  and  adequately  fund  operation  and  maintenance.  The \nongoing ADB technical assistance (footnote 3) is supporting these reforms in this regard.  \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n 15\n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  Government  and  Barki  Tajik  provided  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the \n\n77. \nstandard assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation Unit \n\nThe Government shall ensure that Barki Tajik maintains responsibility for the Project and \n\n78. \nemploys the services of the PMU in regards to day to day management of the Project. \n \n79. \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  tender  evaluation  committee  for  all  tenders \nrelated to the Project shall include at least two Barki Tajik employees of which one shall be the \nchair of the committee.  \n \n80. \nThe  PMU  shall  appoint  a  dedicated  full-time  team  responsible  for  the  administration  of \nthe Project. This shall include the processing of bidding documents, the evaluation of bids, and \nthe supervision of the installation of the project facilities, as well as the necessary liaison among \nBarki Tajik, contractors, and ADB. The team shall be staffed with suitably qualified personnel to \ninclude  a  project  director,  a  procurement  specialist,  a  project  finance  specialist,  project \naccountants, and other experts on demand. \n \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that,  at  all  times  throughout  the  implementation  of  the \n81. \nProject,  the  PMU  project  team  remains  adequately  staffed  and  assisted  by  the  consultants \nengaged under the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nKfW Component \n\nThe  Government  shall  ensure,  and  shall  cause  Barki  Tajik  to  ensure,  that  the  KfW-\n\n82. \nfinanced Nurek 220 kV rehabilitation project is commissioned by no later than June 2011. \n \n\n3. \n\nTariff Adjustments  \n\n83. \nThe  Government  shall  take  all  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  (i)  tariffs  are \nadequately adjusted throughout the project implementation period to enable Barki Tajik to take \ninto account the service costs including inflation and to comply with financial covenants, (ii) the \ntariff is adopted in 2011 and thereafter fully covers the operating cost, and (iii) public awareness \nprograms are conducted to educate the public on the need for a rational electricity tariff scheme \nand the importance of energy conservation. \n \n\n4. \n\nUse of Principal and Interest Repayments \n\nThe Government shall ensure that repayments of principal and interest by Barki Tajik to \n84. \nthe  Government  arising  from  the  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement  between  Barki  Tajik  and  the \nGovernment  are  used  exclusively  for  tariff  subsidies  for  poor  and  vulnerable  electricity \nconsumers  in  accordance  with  a  methodology  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  specific  methodology \nshall be agreed with ADB and duly reflected in the subsidiary Loan Agreement.  \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nGovernance and Transparency \n\n \n\n85. \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  no  material  changes  (either  financial,  structural,  or \noperational)  to,  nor  major  asset  transfer  to  and  from,  Barki  Tajik  are  formally  approved  or \nimplemented during the term of the Grant, without prior ADB approval, if such changes would or \nare  likely  to  affect  the  ability  of  Barki  Tajik  to  perform  its  obligations  under  the  Project \nAgreement and Subsidiary Loan Agreement. In the event that Barki Tajik or any part thereof is \nprivatized during the term of the grant, the Government shall consult with ADB in order to review \nthe terms and conditions of this Grant Agreement with a view to making any amendments that \nmay be deemed necessary. \n \n86. \nThe  Government  shall  cause  Barki  Tajik  to  have  the  project  and  corporate  accounts \nannually  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  shall  cause \nBarki Tajik to provide adequate funds for carrying out such audits. \n \n87. \nThe Government shall cause Barki Tajik to establish, within 1 year of the effective date \nof the Grant Agreement, a website that will present information on all externally funded projects. \nWith  regard  to  the  Project,  the  website  shall  provide  information  on,  among  other  things, \nfinancial  statements  of  Barki  Tajik,  procurement  activities  (including  the  list  of  participating \nbidders),  names  of  the  winning  bidders,  basic  details  on  the  adopted  bidding  procedures, \namounts  of  the  contracts  awarded,  the  list  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  and  their \nintended and actual utilization. \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Management \n\nThe Government shall cause Barki Tajik to comply with the following requirements: \n\n88. \n \n89. \nBarki  Tajik  shall  maintain  its  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  IFRS.  The \nfinancial  statements  shall  be  audited  annually  by  an  external  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB \naccompanied by the auditor\u2019s letter to Barki Tajik management and management\u2019s response to \nit.  Barki  Tajik  will  submit  to  ADB  its  audited  annual  reports  in  English  within  6  months  of  the \nclose of every fiscal year. \n \n90. \nBarki Tajik shall ensure that its accounts receivable (i) from 31 December 2008, do not \nexceed  the  equivalent  of  the  aggregate  amount  of  6  months  of  billings  at  the  end  of  each \nquarter;  and  (ii)  from  31  December  2009  onwards,  are  maintained  at  a  level  that  does  not \nexceed the equivalent of the aggregate amount of 3 months of billing. \n \n91. \n(percentage of operating expenses against revenues) of less than 90%. \n \n92. \nExcept as ADB shall otherwise agree, Barki Tajik shall not incur any debt, unless its free \ncash flows for the 12 months prior to the date of such incurrence shall be at least 1.3 times the \nestimated  maximum  debt  service  requirements  of  Barki  Tajik  for  any  succeeding  year  on  all \ndebt of Barki Tajik, including the debt to be incurred. \n \n\nFrom  31  December  2008  onwards,  Barki  Tajik  shall  maintain  an  operating  ratio \n\n7. \n\nCollection Efficiency \n\nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  Barki  Tajik  has  adequate  legal  powers  and \n93. \nenforcement mechanisms to effectively collect  service fees and penalize defaulters in order to \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n 17\n\nimprove  the  collection  efficiency,  deter  nonpayment,  and  ensure  sustainability  of  Barki  Tajik \noperations. \n \n\n8. \n\nEnvironment and Safety \n\n94. \nThe Government shall cause Barki Tajik to ensure that the Project is carried out, and all \nproject  facilities  are  designed,  constructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in  compliance  with \napplicable  national  laws  and  government  regulations  concerning  environmental  protection, \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003) \n(footnote  10)  and  the  IEE  including  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan, \nprepared for the Project and agreed with ADB. \n \nAlthough the Government has issued written confirmation that hazardous materials are \n95. \nnot  used  in  the  existing  equipment  scheduled  for  dismantling,  the  Government  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  disposal  of  such  materials  if  any  are  identified.  In  such  case,  the \nGovernment shall immediately inform ADB and shall ensure, or cause Barki Tajik to ensure, that \nadequate  budget  is  allocated  for  the  safe  disposal  of  the  hazardous  materials  in  accordance \nwith  relevant  laws  of  Tajikistan  as  well  as  international  conventions  the  Government  is  a \nsignatory to. \n \n \nThe  existing  social  and  environment  management  unit  of  the  PMU  is  responsible  for \n96. \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  identified  under  the  IEE  and  the \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy, and will inform ADB about the progress of social \nand environmental monitoring through regular reports. \n \n\n9. \n\nSocial Safeguard \n\n97. \nLAR  is  not  envisaged  in  the  Project.  However,  if  any  LAR  needs  are  identified  during \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  the  Government  shall  cause  Barki  Tajik  to  ensure  that  all \nactivities  under  the  Project  are  carried  out  in  full  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), including the preparation of the \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  in  full  consultation  with  affected  people.

The country faces energy deficits and cannot meet its winter demand, with the deficits \nin the winter of 2007/2008 being particularly severe.   \n\nThe  predominance  of  hydroelectric-based  energy  creates  a  problem  for  Tajikistan  as \n2. \nhydropower production exceeds demand in summer and is reduced in winter when glacial melt \nis least and demand is most. As a result, Tajikistan imports electricity and fossil fuels in winter to \nmeet  energy  needs.  In  summer  electricity  is  exported,  but  there  is  excess  water  due  to  low \nelectricity demand and insufficient water storage facilities.   \n\n3. \nPer  capita  domestic  energy  consumption  is  high  given  the  country's  level  of  economic \ndevelopment.  This  is  because  of  the  low  end-use  efficiency  and  high  heating  requirements \nduring winter. With the rise in prices of imported fuel, households have switched to electricity for \nheating  and  cooking,  reflecting  the  fact  that  electricity  is  the  only  form  of  reliable  energy \navailable  and  that  the  Government\u2019s  historical  below-cost  pricing  policies  have  encouraged  a \nshift to electricity away from other forms of energy. \n\n4. \nUntil recently, average electricity tariffs were considerably below cost-recovery levels at \n$0.006  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  However,  the  Government  is  now  committed  to  bringing  the \naverage  tariff  to  a  more  financially  viable  level  of  $0.025/kWh  (in  2003  terms)  by  the  end  of \n2010.  In  the  gas  sector,  the  current  tariffs  have  been  increased  so  that  they  are  closer  to  the \nfinancial viability levels. Coal prices are market based. \n\nB. \n\nInstitutional Structure \n\nAt the policy and regulatory level, the Fuel and Energy Department in the Office of the \n5. \nPresident has overall responsibility for the energy sector. The Ministry of Energy and Industry, \nestablished  in  October  2000,  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  Government's  energy  policy. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade  regulates  the  prices  of  electricity,  natural \ngas, and district heat. This committee reports directly to the Office of the President. The Ministry \nof  Environmental  Protection  is  responsible  for  environmental  regulation  of  energy  operations. \nThe Committee on State Property exercises ownership functions over state-owned assets. \n \n6. \nBarki  Tajik,  a  joint  stock  company  100%  owned  by  the  state,  is  a  vertically  integrated \nutility responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in Tajikistan, except \nin Gorno Badakshan Autonomous Oblast where the privately owned Pamir Energy operates all \npower facilities under a 25-year concession granted in 2002.  \n \n7. \nIn the natural gas sector, Tajik Gas was formed as a state unitary enterprise responsible \nfor  import,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  gas  in  the  country.  In  the  heating  sector,  three \ninstitutions are responsible: (i) Barki Tajik, (ii) the Dushanbe District Heating System Enterprise \nowned  by  the  municipality,  and  (iii)  the  State  Unitary  Enterprise  of  Housing  and  Communal \nServices. \n \nThe  state  coal  mining  company,  Tajikangisht,  was  abolished  in  2003  and  the \n8. \nDepartment  of  Coal  in  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Industry  was  given  the  responsibility  to \ncorporatize and privatize the coal mines. One coal mine (Shurab) has been corporatized as a \njoint stock company; another (Rovnov) has become a joint-venture private company.  \n \nC. \n\nPower Sector \n\n9. \nThe power sector alone represents up to 5% of gross domestic product and is a critical \ninput for the main exports of cotton and aluminum. Despite this, no significant investments have \nbeen made since the country\u2019s independence in 1991, leading to a deterioration of the physical \ninfrastructure,  which  in  turn  results  in  high  network  losses  and  reduced  reliability.  In  addition, \ncommercial  losses  are  high,  partly  due  to  the  legacy  of  supplying  energy  without  meters  and \npartly due to the lack of commercial orientation within the utilities.  \n \n10. \nTajikistan\u2019s transmission network consists of three separate grids: (i) one in the north of \n220  kilovolt  (kV)  connecting  the  sole  hydropower  plant  (Kairaikum,  240  MW  capacity),  (ii)  the \ncentral  grid with  an  installed  generation  capacity  of  3,895  MW,  and  (iii)  one  in  the  west  in  the \nGorno Badakshan region. \n \n11. \nAnnual hydropower energy output is about 16,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) and electricity \nis  delivered  to  nearly  100%  of  the  population.  On  average,  Tajikistan  has  a  summer  (May\u2013\nSeptember)  surplus  of  1,500  GWh  available  for  export  with  an  unmet  demand  of  2,500 \nmegawatt-hours (MWh) over the remaining non-summer months.

It  serves  a  customer \nbase of approximately 1 million people and employed 11,200 staff in 2007. Barki Tajik is in poor \nfinancial  condition  following  years  of  below-cost  tariffs,  high  losses,  and  poor  collection  rates. \nThe  private  Pamir  Energy  operates  the  existing  40  MW  of  generation  and  transmission  and \ndistribution system in the western Gorno Badakshan region serving a population of 200,000. \n \n14. \nNew large generation projects are being constituted as new joint stock companies (e.g. \nSangtuda  I  joint  stock  company  has  been  formed  for  completing  the  construction  of  the  large \nrun-of-river Sangtuda I hydroelectric project). Installed power generation capacity, at 4,405 MW, \nmainly  comprises  six  hydropower  plants  totaling  4,060  MW  and  two  fossil  fuel-fired  combined \nheat and power stations totaling 345 MW. Nurek is by far the largest hydropower plant and has \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23\n\nbeen in operation since 1972 with an installed capacity of 3,000 MW. It provides regulation of \nthe  Vakhsh  River  and  gives  stability  to  the  power  system  in  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n \nD. \n\nProblems and Opportunities \n\nThe main issues faced by the Tajik energy sector are: \n\n15. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\ndespite  well-developed  infrastructure,  the  country  faces  energy  deficits  and \ncannot meet its winter demand; \nthe infrastructure is in poor technical condition with the problem compounded by \na shift in electricity consumption patterns; \nthe  historically  low  level  of  electricity  pricing  impedes  necessary  resource \nmobilization; \nthe  institutional  framework  does  not  reflect  the  needs  of  a  market-oriented \neconomy, and lacks commercial orientation;  \nthe state-owned enterprise Barki Tajik needs major restructuring; and \ndespite  having  abundant  electricity  generation  potential,  including  some  partly \ncompleted  hydropower  resources and  some  power-hungry  electricity  markets  in \nneighboring countries, the country is exploiting this potential suboptimally. \n\n \n16. \nIn 2005, Tajikistan developed a strategy based on a two-track approach for the domestic \nand  export  markets.  The  first  track  focuses  on  the  domestic  market,  and  comprises  a  set  of \npolicy  and  investment  measures  aimed  to  bring  the  sector  to  reasonable  operating  conditions \nand  improve  its  financial  viability.  The  policy  measures  include  (i)  the  implementation  of  a \nmedium-term  tariff  policy;  (ii)  a  social  protection  policy  for  energy  services  to  improve  the \neffectiveness of the scheme and ensure a more targeted approach to support the poor; and (iii) \nan institutional reform policy for the energy sector to improve the transparency and efficiency of \noperations,  enable  electricity  trade,  and  pave  the  way  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \nsector. The investment measures include implementation of programs for (i) increased energy \nefficiency;  (ii)  demand-side  management  including  a  heat  supply  strategy;  and  (iii)  increasing \nenergy  supply  to  meet  winter  demand,  with  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  existing  assets.  The \nsecond track focuses on increasing electricity exports by (i) using existing seasonal surpluses in \nthe summer, and (ii) attracting private sector investors to join in developing newer hydroelectric \nand thermal capacities for exports to neighboring and regional countries.   \n \nE. \n\nCurrent Power Sector Developments \n\n17.  Winter  supply  deficit  continues  to  be  a  problem  despite  imports  of  electricity  from  the \nKyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Barki Tajik is implementing improved rationing \nprocedures  whereby  load  shedding  commences  earlier  in  the  season  resulting  in  improved \nsupply  during  the  coldest  winter  months.  However,  solution  of  the  winter  deficit  problem  will \nrequire  new  HEPPs  with  seasonal  storage  capacity  and/or  additional  thermal  generation \ncapacity. Regarding possible new thermal generation, a United States Trade and Development \nAgency-funded study, due to commence in 2008, will examine the viability of commercial coal \nmine developments for which a thermal power plant would be a potential customer. \n\n18. \nThe  Sangtuda1  670  MW  HEPP,  70%  owned  by  RAO  UES  of  Russia  and  30%  by  the \nGovernment, is under construction, with completion scheduled for 2009. Following the Shanghai \nCooperation  Organization  meeting  in  Tajikistan  in  August  2009,  the  governments  of  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Russian  Federation  have  signed  agreements  with  the \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nGovernment  of  Tajikistan  to  finance  four  new  HEPPs,  three  of  which  will  be  financed  by  the \nRussian Federation (the largest with a capacity of 250 MW), and one by the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (with a capacity of 200 MW). Tajikistan continues to promote the development of the \nRogun 3,600 MW HEPP, construction of which started during the Soviet era but has since been \nsuspended.  A  World  Bank-funded  feasibility  study  is  due  to  commence  in  2008.  This  major \nproject  would  serve  the  dual  purposes  of  meeting  Tajikistan  winter  demand  and  allowing \nTajikistan to export the considerable surplus energy.   \n\nAn  ADB-funded  technical  assistance  project  (footnote  3)  is  assisting  the  Ministry  of \n19. \nEnergy and Industry in preparing options for the restructuring of Barki Tajik, and in implementing \nthose options, with project completion due in 2010.   \n\nThe Ministry of Economic Development and Trade and Barki Tajik have agreed upon an \n20. \napproach to tariff rationalization and increase. Tariff categories have been reduced to six (albeit \nwith further subgroups) and favorable tariffs for low-usage customers and special summer and \nwinter  tariffs  for  Tajikistan  Aluminum  Company  have  been  eliminated.  The  weighed  average \ntariff  is  forecast  to  be  $0.025/kWh  in  2010,  a  three  times  increase  of  the  average  tariff  from \n2007,  with  the  most  recent  increase  approved  in  July  2008.  Nevertheless,  further  tariff \nrationalization and increases are required to eliminate cross subsidies and fully cover Barki Tajik \ncosts. \n\n21. \nThe first track of the Government\u2019s strategy\u2014to focus on the domestic market\u2014is being \nsupported  by  the  multilateral  and  bilateral  donor  community  through  a  range  of  rehabilitation \nprojects  (Appendix  3).  The  proposed  Nurek  500  kV  Reconstruction  Project,  which  will  enable \ncontinued electricity supply to Tajikistan, is consistent with this strategy. The second track of the \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy\u2014to  focus  on  the  export  market\u2014is  being  implemented  with  (i)  the \nsigning of loans for the construction of the Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan transmission interconnection, \nand  (ii)  the  ongoing  development  of  the  Central  Asia\u2013South  Asia  Regional  Electricity  Market \nProject1  which  envisages  the  building  of  a  high-voltage  transmission  interconnection  to  allow \nelectricity exports from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of \nwhich are energy deficient.   \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

The economic analysis is \nbased on a time-slice approach to the rehabilitation plan. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) compares the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits \nbased on willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2009 constant \nprices. The analysis period includes the construction period and 40 years of operation. Details \nof  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic  analysis  are  presented  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  In  the  absence  of  this  Project,  there  will  be  chronic  supply \nshortages.  Demand  forecasts  and  cost\u2013benefit  projections  were  prepared  and  analyzed,  and \nthey indicated that the Project is economically viable. The economic analysis confirms that the \nProject is economically viable. \n \nB. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n2. \nThe least-cost analysis serves to show that the Project is the least-cost solution for the \nreliable supply of power to Tajikistan and to the Central Asian power transmission grid. There is \nno  viable  alternative  to  relocation  of  the  switchyards  and  construction  of  gas-insulated \nswitchgear switchyards. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Assumptions \n\nThe  calculation  for  the  economic  analysis  is  based  on,  among  other  things,  the \n\n3. \nassumptions included in Table A7.1. \n \n\nTable A7.1: Economic Assumptions \n\nItem \nShadow Pricing \n\nCosts and Benefits \nDiscount Rate \nDecommissioning Costs \nResettlement, Land Acquisition \nO&M \n\nAssumptions \nConversion  factor:  0.9  for  local  materials  and  0.75  for  unskilled \nlabor a\nConstant 2009 prices \n12% \nNone \nNone \n$60,000  and  major  overhaul  of  $200,000  every  10  years;  O&M \nhigher than existing equipment due to the high-tech nature of gas-\ninsulated switchgear technology \n3 years \n50 years \n11,250 GWh, 500 kV switchyard transmits 7,500 GWh \n\nConstruction Period \nEconomic Life \nAverage Annual Generation \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, kV = kilovolt, O&M = operation and maintenance. \na    Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2000.

The  economic  analysis  assumes  that,  in  regards  to  the \nwithout-project  scenario,  Barki  Tajik  does  not  have  funds  to  rehabilitate  the  whole  500  kilovolt \n(kV) switchyard at once, and would rehabilitate the switchyard over a 10-year period using new \nair-insulated switchgear technology at $1 million per annum on the existing site. Although there \nis subsidence, for purposes of analyzing the scenario, prevention measures are taken annually \nwith costs increasing by $50,000 per annum. A catastrophic scenario with regard to a landslide \nor subsidence has been ignored for purposes of the economic analysis. \n \n5. \nAnnual output of the Nurek HEPP via the 500 kV switchyard is assumed to decrease by \n60%  during  the  10  years  of  rehabilitation.  Once  rehabilitation  is  complete,  the  switchyard  is \nassumed to transmit 90% of the total energy of 7,500 gigawatt-hours (GWh) due to shutdowns \nbecause of subsidence prevention measures and minor landslides. \n \nD. \n\nQuantification of Benefits \n\nThe benefits of avoided equipment breakdown and avoided geological catastrophes can \n6. \nbe  quantified  in  terms  of  avoided  loss  of  energy,  measured  in  kWh.  Additionally,  the  avoided \ncosts of risk mitigation and of repairs after equipment failures, measured in US dollars, have to \nbe considered. In the following, the avoided loss of energy and the avoided mitigation costs are \nquantified  separately  for  the  geological  risk  and  for  the  breakdown  of  aging  equipment.  The \nimpact  of  loss  of  energy  on  the  other  economies  in  Central  Asia  cannot  be  quantified  and  is \ntherefore not further considered in the following quantitative analysis. \n \n\n1. \n\nEffect of Equipment Breakdown \n\n7. \nThe switchyard is over 35 years old and worn out. As explained in para. 5, the without-\nproject  scenario  foresees  failures  of  individual  components  and  increased  shutdowns  forcing \nBarki  Tajik  to  rehabilitate  using  its  own  funds.  During  10  years  of  rehabilitation,  the  model \nassumes 60% of the generated electricity to be transmitted though the 500 kV switchyard, and \n90% thereafter. \n \n\n2. \n\nEffect of Geological Risk \n\n8. \nThe subsidence in the 500 kV switchyard destabilizes the equipment. In order to avoid \nthe collapse of towers, Barki Tajik monitors the areas for sinkholes, fills them, adds extensions \nto the legs of the towers and strengthens the foundations with concrete. In the without-project \ncase, this procedure needs to be continued at an annual cost of approximately $30,000. So far, \nthis  procedure  has  successfully  prevented  equipment  failure  and  no  energy  was  lost  due  to \nuplifting and/or subsidence. It is assumed that in the future the mitigation measures will continue \nto  be  successful.  The  annual  cost  is  increased  by  $50,000  per  annum  due  to  increased \ndifficulties of uplifting and/or subsidence as time goes by. \n \nE. \n\nValuation of Benefits \n\n9. \nThe avoided cost of risk mitigation and damage repair is expressed in monetary terms \nas explained above, but the monetary value of the lost energy also needs to be determined for \nthe economic analysis. There are several options for this valuation: \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n1. \n\nCost of Unserved Energy \n\n10. \nThe  economic  costs  of  unserved  energy  have  been  estimated  in  numerous  studies.  In \nthe  literature  on  economic  costs  of  outages,  costs  are  generally  broken  down  into  short-  and \nlong-run costs. Short-run costs comprise product spoilage and damage to machinery, shutdown \nand restart costs, forgone revenues from underutilized production capacities. Long-run costs are \nmainly identified with the cost of mitigating the effects of power outages with standby generators \nor by switching completely to self-generation. Estimates for the cost of unserved energy depend \non the country and the consumer category; they range between $0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \nand $0.50 per kWh for households, and over $1/kWh for commercial and industrial consumers. \n \n\n2. \n\nWillingness to Pay \n\n11. \nThe  willingness  of  consumers  to  pay  for  electricity  is  usually  derived  from  the  amount \nspent on other sources of energy when electricity is not available, such as candles, kerosene, \nand  stand-by  generators.  This  amount  depends  on  the  uses  of  electricity  and  is  different  for \nparticular groups and consumers. In the evaluation of ADB projects in the past,1 the willingness \nto  pay  was  estimated  at  $0.20/kWh  based  on  the  cost  of  auto-generation  at  a  10%  utilization \nfactor. The Power Sector Development Project2 valued the unserved energy at twice the long-\nrun marginal cost, or at $0.042/kWh, which was also equivalent to the average import tariff. \n \n\n3. \n\nValue of Energy Import \n\n12. \nIt  is  unlikely  that  the  Government  of  Tajikistan will  not  look  for  other  sources  of  supply \nwhen  the  supply  from  Nurek  HEPP  is  interrupted.  The  contribution  of  the  Tajik  Aluminum \nCompany  (TALCO,  a  major  aluminum  joint  stock  company  in  Tajikistan  and  by  far  the  largest \ncustomer of Barki Tajik) to the gross domestic product of Tajikistan is considered so important \nthat  in  the  winter,  when  domestic  energy  supply  is  insufficient,  energy  for  TALCO  is  imported \nfrom  Uzbekistan  at  an  import  tariff  much  higher  than  the  tariff  paid  by  TALCO.  It  is  therefore \nmethodologically not justified to value the lost energy in the without-project situation at the cost \nof unserved energy (damage cost and mitigation cost) or at the willingness to pay. \n \nIt  is  more  appropriate  to  use  the  value  of  alternative  sources  of  electricity  supply, \n13. \nincluding  import  from  Uzbekistan  (currently  at  $0.015/kWh  with  a  capacity  of  1,200  MW)  and \ngeneration from Sangtuda I and Rogun HEPPs. Sangtuda is expected to be operational in 2010, \nwhile  Rogun  is  planned  to  be  commissioned  later.  Both  plants  are  built  to  serve  the  export \nmarket, but in an emergency situation the energy could be diverted for domestic use. The value \nof this energy is then equal to the forgone export tariff, estimated at $0.02\u2013$0.03/kWh. For the \npurpose of the economic analysis, an average value of $0.02/kWh is used. \n \nF. \n\nResults \n\n14. \nThe  EIRR  and  the  net  present  value  for  the  Project  has  been  calculated.  The  Project \nwas evaluated on the basis of avoided loss of energy, costs of maintenance (both periodic and \ncapital),  and  capital  expenditures.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  A7.2.  Detailed \ncalculations are contained in Table A7.3.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2002.

In general, the EIRRs are not highly sensitive and exceed the \neconomic  hurdle  rates  for  scenarios  tested.  The  implication  is  that  the  Project  is  rehabilitating \nwhat  is  currently  a  key  bottleneck  of  economic  development  and  needs  to  be  urgently \nimplemented  to  prevent  chronic  shortages.  On  this  basis,  the  Project  appears  to  be \neconomically viable. \n \nConclusions. The analysis verifies that the Project is economically viable, producing a \n16. \nrange  of  estimated  EIRRs  of  between  24.3%  and  the  base  case  at  36.7%.  All  the  scenarios \nhave  an  EIRR  greater  than  the  economic  discount  rate.  There  are,  however,  no  alternative \noptions  for  the  Project\u2014location  of  the  switchyard  in  different  sites  within  the  Nurek  HEPP \ncompound would give the same economic benefits, but would increase the cost of the Project. \nThe  Project  continues  to  be  viable  and  sustainable  for  a  reasonable  range  of  downside \nscenarios. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n

\n\nLending/Financing Modality:  Project / Grant \n\n \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nCentral and West Asia Department/ \nInfrastructure Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  (June  2002)  recognizes  that  availability  of  adequate \ninfrastructure  is  an  essential  element  in  achieving  satisfactory  economic  growth,  which  in  turn  provides  the  means  for \nreducing poverty. It also recognizes the urgent need for rehabilitating the energy infrastructure currently in a serious state of \ndisrepair.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  2006\u20132008a  for  Tajikistan  also \nidentifies  stable  power  supply  as  one  of  its  key  interventions  and  mentions  this  Nurek  500  kV  Switchyard  Reconstruction \nProject. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAs the Project is the reconstruction of an existing switchyard that feeds power to the national grid, it is not expected to deliver \nimmediate direct benefits to the poor. \n\nThe Project is the reconstruction of the existing 500 kilovolt (kV) switchyard of the 3,000 megawatt (MW) Nurek Hydroelectric \nPower Plant (HEPP) commissioned in 1972. Nurek HEPP supplies 75% of Tajikistan's electricity and, as one of the largest \npower plants in Central Asia, it plays the role of controlling the frequency of the Central Asian power system, which includes \ngrids of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The existing switchyard is obsolete with limited spare \nparts available and is also constructed on top of a salt dome where land subsidence has been experienced for over a decade. \nThe loss of the switchyard will have catastrophic ramifications, as electricity generated from Nurek HEPP will not be able to be \nevacuated. The reconstruction will ensure stable and reliable supply of power, which will contribute to the development of the \nnational economy and, therefore, can be expected to result in indirect benefits to the poor. \n\n2. Design Features \n \nOpportunity to include a pro-poor design is limited as the Project broadly benefits the economy. Employment opportunities for \nthe poor and vulnerable are also limited as the number of laborers to be hired is minimal. \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nn/a \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nNo negative social impacts are envisaged as the Project is implemented within the fenced premises of Nurek HEPP owned by \nBarki Tajik, the national power utility, except for the spoil bank. The new 500 kV switchyard will be constructed on the existing \n220 kV switchyard site. Both switchyards are in the Nurek HEPP compound. \n\nSpoil  from  excavation  will  be  disposed  in  the  designated  spoil  bank  just  outside  the  Nurek  HEPP  compound.  The  local \ngovernment  has  granted  Barki  Tajik  the  use  of  this  plot  of  land.  The  spoil  bank  area  once  used  to  be  the  borrow  site  to \nexcavate materials for the construction of the Nurek dam body some 30 years ago. It has since been used intensively by Barki \nTajik. Until recently, the area was used as a spoil bank to dispose of sediments dredged from the Vakhsh River downstream \nof  Nurek  HEPP  tailrace  in  the  Vakhsh  River  Excavation  subproject  under  the  ADB  Loan  1817-TAJ:  Power  Rehabilitation \nProject.b\n\nThe  Project  will  result  in  approximately  50  new  temporary  jobs  being  created  for  construction,  including  both  skilled  and \nunskilled labor. Adherence to ADB's core labor standardsc and the Labor Law of Tajikistan (1997) will be included in the Grant \nAgreement  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  turnkey  contract.  Requirement  for  education  on  HIV/AIDS  and  prohibition  of \nchild  labor  will  also  be  indicated  in  the  Grant  Agreement  and  the  bidding  documents.  These  items  will  be  monitored  by  the \nproject management unit and will be reported to ADB through quarterly progress reports.  \n\nResidential  quarters  of  the  laborers  to  be  hired  by  the  Project  will  be  located  outside  the  Nurek  HEPP  compound  due  to \nsecurity reasons. The contractor will lease one of the several vacant factory yards available in the vicinity of Nurek HEPP. For \nexample,  the  contractor  for  the  aforementioned  ADB  loan  subproject  leased  an  abandoned  factory  yard  just  a  few  hundred \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n38 \n \nmeters from Nurek HEPP. \n\nAs seen from the above, the Project does not entail land acquisition, resettlement, or any negative social impacts. \n\nAs Nurek HEPP supplies 75% of the electricity consumed in the country, a reliable 500 kV switchyard that evacuates power \nfrom  Nurek  HEPP  is  beneficial  to  the  entire  nation.  The  poor  and  the  non-poor  will  benefit  equally  from  the  Project  directly \nthrough the supply of electricity from the Project if they are users of electricity and indirectly through the development of the \nTajik economy. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation  \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nNo negative social impacts are envisaged, but a public consultation was held in accordance with ADB's Environment Policy \n(2002).  Public  consultation  was  held  on  11  September  2008  at  the  Nurek  City  Administration  Office  and  attended  by \napproximately 70 participants. No concerns were raised over the Project. \n\n \n2.

If no, explain why. \n \nAs explained above, the findings of the social analysis show that the impact of the Project to the community is negligible, and \nit is judged that a C&P plan is not required.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.

Barki \n1. \nTajik  has  the  ability  to  undertake  and  fulfill  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  Nurek  500  kV \nSwitchyard Reconstruction Project. Financial management assessment questionnaires and field \ninterviews  were  used  to  review  the  present  standing  of  financial  management.  Due \nconsideration has been given to the fact that Barki Tajik is in transition from being a vertically \nintegrated  government  company  to  a  fully  independent  corporate  entity.  Progress  on \nstrengthening corporate governance and financial management is under way. \n \n\n1. \n\nCorporate Structure \n\n2. \nBarki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  of  electricity  in  Tajikistan.  Prior  to  the  country\u2019s  independence,  Barki  Tajik  was \nadministratively  a  Government  entity.  A  detailed  corporate  structure  and  an  analysis  of  Barki \nTajik\u2019s financial management is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n3. \nIn  1992,  Barki  Tajik  became  a  state  joint  stock  holding  company.  Although  it  is  fully \nowned  by  the  Government,  Barki  Tajik  enjoys  autonomous  status  according  to  its  charter.  In \n2000, Barki Tajik was incorporated as a commercial entity and a formal separation of operations \ntook place along its business lines. In 2004, Barki Tajik was merged with the Ministry of Energy \nand  Industry.  In  March  2006,  this  merger  was  revoked  and  Barki  Tajik  separated  from  the \nMinistry of Energy and Industry. \n \n4. \nBarki  Tajik  is  managed  by  a  chair  and  a  board  of  directors  appointed  by  the \nGovernment. Ten general services departments (among them planning, accounting, and sales) \nreport directly to the Barki Tajik chair, who also manages issues of great importance, such as \nthe  power  supply  contract  with  Tajik  Aluminum  Company  (TALCO,  the  largest  industrial \nconsumer  with  40%  of  total  consumption),  or  the  financing  of  new  investment  projects.  The \noverall staff of the utility is about 11,480 people, of whom about 290 work in the head office in \nDushanbe. \n \nB. \n \nThe financial sustainability of the power transmission sector is dependent on timely and \n5. \naccurate  (i)  submission  of  tariff  applications  by  Barki  Tajik,  (ii)  execution  of  the  tariff \ndetermination by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, (iii) notification of the tariff \ndetermination  by  the  Government,  and  (iv)  collection  of  payments  from  customers.  As  for \ncorporate issues, Barki Tajik has financial and management independence issues that need to \nbe remedied. \n \n\nFinancial Management Issues and Mitigating Measures \n\n1. \n\nTariff Issues \n\n \n6. \nIn the tariff determination, the revenue requirement to cover general establishment and \nadministrative  expenses,  repair  and  maintenance,  depreciation,  and  costs  are  determined  by \nBarki Tajik\u2019s planning department and are submitted to the Ministry of Economic Development \nand Trade. \n \n7. \n\nTariffs are supposed to be regulated by the Anti Monopoly Commission, which played a \n\n \n\n \n\n\f          Appendix 9      41 \n\n \n\nregulatory role until 2006. After the election in 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers was reorganized \nand  the  regulatory  body  was  integrated  as  a  department  within  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment and Trade. However, neither before the reorganization nor after did the regulator \nexercise its function of independent tariff setting. Due to the high political and social sensitivity \nof  electricity  tariffs  in  transition  countries,  it  is  typical  that  the  governments  are  the  ultimate \ninstitution in the approval process. On a semiannual basis Barki Tajik proposes tariff increases, \ntrying to reach cost-recovery level, but in the past these have either not been approved or only \npartially accepted by the Government. \n \n8. \nThe current process is relatively new and before tariff increases for 2008 were approved, \ntariffs  had  not  been  raised  for  the  last  5  years.  Currently,  after  submission  by  Barki  Tajik,  the \napplication  for  the  new  tariff  is  reviewed  by  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade \nand is sent to the Government and is ultimately approved by the President. \n \n9. \nDue to pressures from the international financial institutions (IFIs), tariffs were calculated \nup  to  2010 and  approved  by  the  President  in January  2008.  It  is  not known  if  this  system  will \nwork for tariffs after 2010; however, the IFIs take comfort from the fact that the Government is \nserious in its efforts in restructuring and eventual unbundling and privatizing of Barki Tajik. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Independence \n\n \n10. \nBarki  Tajik  has  direct  access  to  foreign  exchange  for  the  purchase  of  spare  parts  and \nother  equipment,  but  the  company  is  unable  to  finance  new  investment  and  the  necessary \nrehabilitation of its aging power system from its own cash flow. The gap is only partially filled by \nsubsidies  from  the  Government.  Funds  from  foreign  donors  are  given  to  the  Government \nthrough the Ministry of Finance who onlends them to Barki Tajik. Even in the cases when the \nbilateral aid takes the forms of grants, the funds are onlent with an interest rate to the utility, in \norder to give Barki Tajik ownership of and responsibility for the funds. \n \n11. \nBarki  Tajik  currently  has  satisfactory  accounting  capacities  and  established  accredited \nexternal  audit  processes  in  accordance  with  international  audit  standards.  In  addition,  Barki \nTajik has developed sufficient in-house functions and systems to handle payments, billings, and \ncollections. \n \n12. \nThe  plans  and  budgets  of  Barki  Tajik  and  its  business  units  are  (i)  reconciled  and \napproved  as  integrated  documents,  (ii)  partially  commercially  independent  of  the  Government, \nand (iii) developed to meet commercial needs. However, forward projections are checked by the \nGovernment  to  ensure  compliance  with  approved  national  socioeconomic  policies.  Due  to  the \ngeneral lack of funds, operating objectives often have to be revised downwards to a level that \ncan  be  realistically  achieved.  The  constant  shortage  of  cash  renders  any  planning  difficult. \nElaborate  planning  systems  comprising  target  parameters,  monitoring  systems,  and  sanctions \nfor deviations from the targets are not workable in such a system of scarcity, which instead calls \nfor a high level of flexibility. Management cannot be held accountable for deficiencies resulting \nfrom lack of funds. However, there are appropriate sanctions for staff who fail to reach targets \nfor other reasons, e.g., billing and collection in the energy sales companies. \n \n\n3.  Management Independence \n\n \nAs the transition period is in process and Barki Tajik has built capacity for independence \n13. \nfrom the Government, the corporate governance structure of its board should be in accordance \nwith  international  best  practices.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  currently  supporting \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nAssumptions for Financial Projections \n\nBarki  Tajik\u2019s  restructuring,  starting  with  creation  of  a  fully  independent  and  operating  board  of \ndirectors. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nDue to the lack of tariff increases in the past years, Barki Tajik relied on subsidies from \nthe Government to pay for its commitments. As a result, Barki Tajik has not been able to fund its \noperation  and  maintenance  as  it  should  and  its  assets  have  been  deteriorating.  Due  to \nrequirements by IFIs such as ADB and the World Bank, the Government made the decision to \nincrease tariffs to a point where Barki Tajik would be able to cover its costs. Barki Tajik is also \nstarting to plan an investment program; however, continued support from the IFIs is necessary \nto improve its corporate planning and management. A detailed analysis of Barki Tajik\u2019s financial \nperformance is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nD. \n \nFinancial  projections  in  terms  of  the  profit  and  loss  account,  balance  sheet,  and  cash \n15. \nflow  of  Barki  Tajik  have  been  prepared  for  25  years  from  2009  to  2033.  The  projections  are \nbased  on  a  consolidated  look  at  the  energy  sector  of  Tajikistan  and  take  into  account  known \ninvestments  for  the  medium  term,  costs,  and generation  capacity.  A  detailed  analysis  of  Barki \nTajik\u2019s financial projections is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n16. \nThe projected revenue is based on the approved tariffs for 2009 and 2010. Based on the \nmost  recent  tariff  determination,  the  weighted  average  tariff  for  2009  is  $0.0182  per  kilowatt-\nhour  (kWh)  for  2009  and  $0.025/kWh  for  2010.  Thereafter,  tariffs  are  increased  to \naccommodate increases in capital costs and cost of power purchases from independent power \nproducers  (IPPs)  planned  to  start  up  in  the  future.  Tariffs  are  expected  to  increase  from \n$0.0182/kWh in 2009 to $0.080/kWh in 2033. Demand is expected to increase 2.4% from 2011, \nwhile collection is assumed at 60% for the first 10 years, 70% from 2021, and 80% from 2031. \nTechnical losses are assumed at a constant 13% and commercial losses constant at 2%. \n \n17. \nThe  main  item  of  costs  in  terms  of  value  is  the  purchase  of  electricity  from  the  IPPs. \nSeveral IPPs are expected to go on line, with a thermal plant expected in 2014, giving the ability \nfor  Barki  Tajik  to  purchase  enough  power  to  supply  winter  peak  demand  with  excess  to  be \nexported. Receivables are assumed at 10% of revenues and payables 15% of operating costs. \nDepreciation is assumed at 5% of fixed assets. \n \n18. \nThe proposed ADB grant and all other capital requirements would be channeled through \nthe  Government  to  Barki  Tajik.  For  the  purposes  of  the  projections,  it  has  been  assumed  that \nthe  onlending  rate  will  be  5%  (in  line  with  current  onlending  rates  to  Barki  Tajik)  and  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years  and  repayment  over  20  years.  The  results  of  the  financial  projections  are  in \nTable A9. \n \nE. \n \n19. \nThe financial management of Barki Tajik is adequate to carry out the fiduciary duties of \nthe  Project.  In  terms  of  financial  strength,  Barki  Tajik  is  receiving  subsidies  from  the \nGovernment  but  is  expected  to  be  self-sustainable  due  to  a  renewed  commitment  from  the \nGovernment in terms of taxes. Barki Tajik is expected to produce enough cash flow to maintain \nits  operation  and  meet  its  debt  service  obligations  for  its  future  investment  program.  The  debt \nservice coverage ratio stands above 1.01 times and the self-financing ratio is satisfactory from \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n\f          Appendix 9      43 \n\n \n\n2009 onwards. \n \n20. \nIn terms of management, measures are being taken to strengthen the independence and \ntransparency of the system. These steps should be adequate and appropriate; however, close \nsupport from ADB and other IFIs is necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n

Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 1   All  financial  costs  and \nbenefits  were  expressed  in  2009  prices.  Cost  streams  used  for  the  purposes  of  financial  internal \nrate of return (FIRR) determination\u2014i.e., capital investment, operation and maintenance, insurance \ncosts, and taxes\u2014reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions  \n\n2. \nCapital  costs  were  estimated  in  US  dollars  expressed  in  constant  prices  over  the \nconstruction  period  of  3  years  for  the  new  switchyard.  Capital  costs  were  derived  from  local \nsources,  which  include  physical  contingencies  at  5%  of  base  costs.  Price  contingencies  and \ninterest during construction were excluded from the estimation of capital costs for the purpose of \nthe FIRR, which is in 2009 prices.  \n \n3. \nFinancial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with- \nand  without-project  investment  scenarios.  The  relocation  and  reconstruction  of  the  switchyards \ndoes not lead to increased energy generation, and thus does not generate incremental increase in \nrevenues. However, the Project secures the future flow of revenues to Barki Tajik. If the switchyard \nis  not  reconstructed,  the  existing  switchyard  will  gradually  break  down,  disrupt  the energy  supply \nfrom  the  Nurek  Hydroelectric  Power  Plant  (HEPP),  and  result  in  a  loss  of  revenue  from  energy \nsales. Thus, the secured revenue from future energy generation may be attributed to the Project. \n \n4. \nThe  without-project  investment  scenario  comprises  the  existing  facility  of  the  switchyard \ndeteriorating in 5 years and Barki Tajik replacing it with a new air-insulated switchgear system over \n10 years due to a lack of funds preventing it from being rehabilitated all at once. \n \n5. \nDue  to  the  unpredictability  of  geological  events,  no  analysis  has  been  undertaken  with \nregard to landslide and subsidence. However, subsidence prevention costs were included initially \nat $30,000 in 2009, escalating by a factor of $50,000 per annum due to the increased difficulties of \nprevention  measures  year  after  year.  As  the  Project  will  be  moved  to  a  different  location,  the \ninvestment scenario does not include this cost as there is no subsidence. \n \nC. \n\nTariff Methodology \n\n6. \nThe  revenue  of  Nurek  HEPP  is  derived  from  the  share  of  generation  in  the  cost-covering \ntariff that has been adjusted for losses. Barki Tajik plans to increase the average end-user tariff to \nthe long-run marginal cost level ($0.025/kWh) by 2010. This tariff needs to cover the entire cost of \nenergy supply, including generation, transmission, and distribution. The share of generation in the \nlong-run marginal cost, and thus in the end-user tariff, is approximately 22% (i.e., $0.0055/kWh).2  \n \n7. \nConsidering that the end-user tariff refers to energy sold, not energy generated, this value \nhas  to  be  further  adjusted.  The  difference  between  energy  generated  and  energy  sold  is \nrepresented by the system and commercial losses. Target system and commercial losses are 10% \nin 2012, but, using a conservative approach, 15% is assumed for this analysis. \n \n\n                                                \n \n1   ADB. 2005.

Stuttgart. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n46 \n \n8. \nAdjusting the generation tariff by 15% losses results in a tariff of $0.0048/kWh generated. \nThis value is used to calculate the annual revenue of Nurek HEPP, reflecting the financial benefit \nof the Project. \n \nD. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\n9. \nFor estimating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), it is assumed that the Asian \nDevelopment Bank will finance 81.86% of the Project costs. The Government of Tajikistan would \nonlend  the  funds  with  25  years  tenor  to  Barki  Tajik  at  5%.  The  balance  will  be  financed  by  the \nGovernment.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution  has  opportunity  costs,  such  as  debt  repayment  or \nalternative  investments.  The  average  cost  of  government  funds  is  calculated  by  dividing  total \ngovernment debt servicing by total government debt; this was 2.6% in 2004.

The parameters with the greatest impact on the financial indicators \nare the reductions in revenue. The costs do not seem to be as sensitive. \n \n12. \nAn analysis was carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR and financial net present \nvalue  to  adverse  changes  in  such  key  variables.  The  scenarios  considered  for  the  sensitivity \nanalyses were a 1-year implementation delay, a 50% increase in capital costs, a 100% increase in \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  a  1-year  delay  in  completion,  and  a  50%  decrease  in  tariffs \n(Table 8.2). The results show that all scenarios having a FIRR above the WACC and the financial \nnet  present  value  is  positive.  Considering  that  the  scenarios  are  relatively  extreme,  it  can  be \nconcluded that the Project is financially viable. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\n \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n\nA.  \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \nThe  Nurek  500  kV  Switchyard  Reconstruction Project  is  the  construction  of  a  new  500 \nkilovolt  (kV)  switchyard  using  gas-insulated  switchgear  technology  and  the  retirement  of  the \nexisting 220 kV switchyard.
