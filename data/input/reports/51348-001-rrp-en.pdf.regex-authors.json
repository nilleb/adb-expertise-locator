THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendations on a proposed (i) \npolicy-based loan (PBL) and (ii) financial intermediation loan (FIL) to the Republic of Uzbekistan \nfor the Mortgage Market Sector Development Program. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Implementing the Mortgage Market Sector Development Program, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The program aims to establish a new institutional framework and financing mechanism to \npromote market-based mortgage finance in Uzbekistan, expand the availability of residential \nmortgage products, and bring product innovation to the banking sector. Measures supported by \nthe  FIL  will  enable  banks  to  access  long-term  funding,  promote  competition,  and  remove \ninefficiencies and distortions in the housing finance market. The PBL will support the Government \nof Uzbekistan in reforming its housing policy and subsidy framework to ensure an efficient use of \npublic  resources  and  achieve  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  housing  subsidies.  The  proposed \ntransaction TA will help implement the program. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Since 2017, Uzbekistan has undertaken critical reforms, which \nhave sustained a gross domestic product (GDP) growth above 5% in 2018.1 The country moved \nto a more liberal exchange rate and trade regime in 2017 and is undertaking major fiscal reforms. \nSubstantive progress has also been achieved through ongoing structural and institutional reforms. \nThe government is keen to continue its reform agenda, but it remains challenging. To sustain high \ngrowth and to make the private sector the primary driver of growth, the government has prioritized \nthe  restructuring  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  public  finance  management  reforms, \nincluding ad hoc transfers from the state budget to SOEs, and finance sector development. \n \n4.  Sector development context. Access to affordable and long-term mortgage finance is \nneeded to meet the growing housing demand, which is the result of population growth and years \nof underinvestment in the housing sector.2 Uzbekistan needs to produce 145,000 new housing \nunits per year until 2040 to keep up with new household formation and replace old housing stock, \nwith most new housing needed in urban areas. This figure is well above current production figures; \nthe housing shortfall is therefore increasing annually despite the government\u2019s involvement to \naddress it. In the past, the government initiated a number of housing subsidy programs mostly \nadministered by state-owned commercial banks to improve the housing conditions in the country.3 \nHowever, the inefficiently structured and targeted subsidies are costly for the government and are \n                                                \n1  This is despite adverse weather conditions for agriculture and ongoing reform challenges such as tariff adjustments \nof utilities and institutional restructuring of the energy sector. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates a need of 100,000 units per year until 2040 to deal with population \ngrowth, based on secondary source estimates of square meters per person needed, while also taking into account \nslowing population growth and decreasing household size. In addition, the country would need an estimated 45,000 \nunits per year until 2040 to decrease substantially the current housing deficit because of overcrowding and poor \nhousing conditions. \n3  Uzbekistan has 21 different government housing subsidy programs targeting, for instance, the rural and urban \npopulation, young families, teachers, military personnel, and public sector employees. \n \n ", "2 \nnot conducive to the development of market-based solutions by focusing solely on a limited \nnumber of households and products.4 \n \n5.  Core  development  problem.  The  government  acknowledges  that  it  lacks  a \ncomprehensive housing policy and subsidies framework. The existing housing finance programs \nare not effectively coordinated in terms of design, targeting, and use of subsidies, resulting in \ninefficient use of limited fiscal resources.5 The government also recognizes the need to gradually \nreplace or phase out the existing programs and move to a market-based mortgage finance \nmechanism in addressing the housing needs of the population. \n \n6.  Low  mortgage  finance  intermediation  by  banks  dominated  by  state  housing \nprograms. The mortgage loan portfolio of Uzbek banks has increased steadily during 2013\u20132018, \nas reflected by the high compound annual growth rate of all bank mortgage loan portfolios of \n31.4% and growth in the total gross loan portfolio of banks of 36.8% during this period. As of the \nend of 2018, the total mortgage loan portfolio had grown to SUM13.8 trillion. However, these \nfigures still only represent 8.3% of banks\u2019 total loans outstanding and 3.4% of the GDP. 6 Since \n2007, most state housing programs have been mainly delivered by public banks.7 Six public banks \nissued 92% of all mortgage loans under the government\u2019s rural and urban housing programs (i.e. \nat subsidized rates). As a result, of the 39,556 mortgage loans issued in 2018, 75% by number, \nand 72% by volume, of loans were issued under the various state housing programs.8 \n \n7.  Lack  of  access  to  long-term  funding  and  underdeveloped  capital  markets.  All \ncommercial banks are constrained by the lack of access to long-term funding (beyond 1 year). \nThis results in banks\u2019 aversion to fund residential mortgages and leads to limited experience and \ninsufficient internal capacity to properly design, analyze, price, and service mortgage loans. The \ncapital market in the country is underdeveloped and illiquid. There is no active bond market to \nmobilize long-term financing from institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance \ncompanies. Despite the sizable mortgage loan portfolio in public banks, these mortgage loans \ncannot be used by the banks for the issuance of corporate bonds or mortgage-backed securities \nbecause of the highly subsidized interest rates. New instruments such as long-term saving plans \nfor households are also absent. \n \n8.  The proposed sector development program (SDP) aims to develop  a market-based \nresidential mortgage market by (i) designing and implementing a new housing policy, reforming \nhousing subsidies, and reviewing the legal and regulatory framework; (ii) strengthening the \ninstitutional framework to administer housing policy and subsidies by establishing a Housing \nAssistance Unit (HAU) in the Ministry of Finance (MOF); and (iii) making long-term fixed-rate local \ncurrency funds available to banks to enable them to expand their range of residential mortgage \n                                                \n4  Most programs focus on housing construction, with interest rate-based subsidies, while no options are provided for \nsmall renovations or purchase of existing housing units. \n5  According to ADB\u2019s calculations, the cost to the government of the finance subsidies to banks and lost tax revenues \nof the various subsidies is about 79% of the cost of a house produced under the subsidy programs or SUM110 million \nfor a SUM140 million house. If construction costs increase, housing prices and the costs of the subsidies will also \nincrease. \n6  These indicators are very modest compared with more mature markets\u2014the percentage of mortgage loans to the \ntotal loan portfolio in banks in the United States and most European countries is about 50%. The ratio of mortgage \nloans to GDP in selected countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States is about 5.6% in the Russian \nFederation and 12.1% in Georgia.

Consistency with Asian Development Bank strategy and country strategy. The \nprogram is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for \nUzbekistan, 2019\u20132023,10 which supports inclusive and sustainable economic growth through \nfinancial market development, access to finance, private sector development, and domestic \nresource mobilization. The program is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \nUzbekistan, 2019\u20132021,11and will be the first SDP in the country. In late 2017, ADB provided \nknowledge support TA to conduct detailed diagnostics of the housing finance sector, which led to \na comprehensive government reform program. The program supports key operational priorities \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 203012 such as making cities more livable, addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality and strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity.  \n \n10.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. Based on ADB\u2019s advice and preparatory work, the \ngovernment prepared a comprehensive presidential decree to reform the mortgage finance \nsector, which was signed on 13 May 2019.13 The decree establishes a strategic road map for the \ndevelopment of the mortgage market, including reforms to the existing housing policy and \nsubsidies framework, over the period of 2019\u20132021. The government plans to gradually reduce \nits direct role in providing long-term funding for residential mortgage finance, remove interest rate \nsubsidies and other distortions in the finance sector, reform the regressive subsidy framework, \nand establish efficient administrative mechanisms. Over time, the government plans to enable the \noperations of new institutions and to replace the current inefficient and costly subsidy programs \nwith transparent and efficient subsidies to make residential mortgages more affordable to low- \nand middle-income families. \n \n11.  Rationale for a sector development program. The SDP modality is justified because \nthe sector requires both a policy reform component and an investment component (supported by \nthe FIL), which are interlinked. The PBL will focus on reforms that are necessary for creating the \nenabling environment for an effective and efficient mortgage finance market. The FIL will help \nestablish a new type of financial institution (i.e., the UMRC) with private sector participation and \nmake long-term funds available to banks. Initially,  the UMRC will use ADB resources and \nsubsequently access the capital market by issuing bonds (i.e., once the domestic capital markets \nare sufficiently developed). Therefore, the program will ensure that (i) reforms to improve market \nintermediation are pursued continuously, (ii) government housing policies and subsidy programs \nare streamlined to effectively support low- and middle-income borrowers, and (iii) much-needed \nlong-term financing to banks is provided to expand the range of market-based mortgage products. \nThese measures will enable banks to access long-term funding, promote competition, and remove \nmarket inefficiencies and distortions. \n \n                                                \n9  Overall, the supply side of the mortgage market infrastructure in Uzbekistan is stronger than in many countries of \nsimilar income level and is conducive to the development of housing finance. ADB\u2019s analysis shows that the main \nsupply-side elements are in place and functional to support the key priority areas for reform (supported under output \n1) aimed at accelerating the development of housing finance. \n10  ADB. 2019.

Program Description \n \n12.  The program is aligned with the following impact: living standards improved for the \npopulation of Uzbekistan.14 The program will have the following outcome: availability of affordable \nmarket-based  residential  mortgage  credit  increased.15  The  outcome  will  be  achieved  by \nestablishing the premise for improved access to long-term market-based funding and enhanced \ndevelopment of competitive housing finance products, as well as reforming the inefficient housing \nsubsidy framework and some of its programs. \n \n13.  The program will have three outputs. The multitranche PBL will primarily support reforms \nunder outputs 1 and 2.16 The PBL comprises 13 policy actions under tranche 1 and 14 policy \nactions under tranche 2. The FIL will focus on delivering output 3 of the program. \n \n14.  Output 1: Policy, regulatory, and legal framework for the mortgage finance industry \nstrengthened. The government will revise and strengthen the existing housing policy and subsidy \nframework, which is presently distorting the financial system (i.e., government housing programs \nare provided at below-market rates, crowding out market funding and pricing). Activities include \nreview of the existing, and establishment of better targeted, subsidy programs that reach lower-\nincome households. Some of the changes under tranche 1 of the PBL are aimed at reducing \nexcessive subsidies and their regressive nature.17 Policy actions under tranche 2 of the PBL will \nfurther deepen these reforms to enhance the fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of pro-poor \ntargeting.18  The  transition,  which  the  UMRC  will  facilitate,  toward  stronger  private  sector \nparticipation in the development of the housing sector will be supported by (i) introducing a new \ncategory of financial institutions specializing in mortgage refinancing activities, (ii) mandating the \nCentral Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) to supervise and regulate this new category of financial \ninstitutions, and (iii) developing new regulations on mortgage lending to induce sound lending \npractices by banks. \n \n15.  Output 2: Housing finance strategy and subsidy framework strengthened. Tranche \n1 of the PBL will establish the institutional mechanisms required to effectively implement and \nrationalize the government\u2019s housing subsidy framework. The government will establish the HAU \nto coordinate all existing housing policies and subsidy programs.19 In the initial phase, the HAU \nwill take stock of the existing government housing programs and redefine the eligibility criteria for \nbeneficiaries, review the housing policy framework, and agree on a road map that sets out \npriorities for the required legal and policy reforms. Ultimately, the HAU will become a single point \n                                                \n14 Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. 2017\u20132021 National Development Strategy. Tashkent. \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 The PBL will also support some of the activities under output 3 such as the incorporation of UMRC, preparation of a \nsupervisory and regulatory framework for companies specializing in mortgage refinancing activities and amendments \nto the capital market regulations governing the procedures for institutional investors to invest in bonds issued by \ncompanies such as UMRC. \n17 For instance, by introducing a gradual step-up process for increasing the interest rates for housing loans rather than \nthe current scheme where interest rates stay at 7% for the first 5 years and then jump to the CBU refinancing rate \n(currently 16%), which creates a payment shock for mortgagors. Other changes include the revision of the \namortization schedule to fixed monthly repayments (annuity scheme) in line with international norms, and the \nintroduction of new lending products in the form of small loans for home repairs and improvements. \n18 The government has eliminated some tax exemptions for existing and new housing subsidy programs starting in \n2020. The presidential decree requires the elimination of all value-added tax benefits from 1 January 2020 onwards \nand the commissioning of an assessment study to evaluate the impact on the economy and state budget with respect \nto a gradual phaseout of deduction of interest and principal payments from the income tax base of the homeowner \nbeneficiaries, the elimination of property tax deductions for all owners of housing units, and tax incentives to \nconstruction companies and suppliers. \n19 The decision to establish the HAU in the MOF was based on the MOF\u2019s capacity, mandate, and past experience. \n ", "5 \nof contact for all housing programs and subsidy schemes, with the objectives of reducing the \nexcessive burden on the public budget and improving efficiency and sustainability. The HAU will \nalso  increase  coverage  by  developing  innovative  and  new  housing  finance  solutions  and \ninstruments (such as the up-front and one-time subsidy schemes for low-income beneficiaries, \nand rental programs in the housing sector). \n \n16.  The following actions will be carried out by the government under tranche 2 of the PBL to \nfacilitate implementation of outputs 1 and 2: (i) introduction of a pilot program of income-based \nup-front housing subsidies for low-income families and preparation of a feasibility study for a new \ngovernment-sponsored  housing  assistance  scheme;  (ii)  development  of  a  comprehensive \nhousing  and  mortgage  market  database;  (iii)  eventual  transformation  of  the  HAU  into  an \nindependent housing agency; (iv) preparation and approval of a new system for the collection and \ntimely dissemination of statistical data and information on the housing sector, which will ultimately \nlead to the establishment of a house price index; (v) review and amendment of the current \nprudential and regulatory framework governing housing finance and mortgage lending in line with \ninternational norms; and (vi) comprehensive review of the housing sector (demand and supply \nsides) to identify areas and initiatives to promote greater competition by introducing international \nbest practices. A feasibility study will also look into the future roles and relevance of the two \ndominant state-owned real estate developers. \n \n17.  Output 3: The establishment and operationalization of the mortgage refinancing \ncompany supported with long-term funding. Under this output (solely addressed by the FIL), \nADB will provide long-term funding to the proposed UMRC to make long-term local currency \nresources available to banks to fund residential mortgage and housing improvement loans.20 The \nUMRC will facilitate the provision of mortgage loans at an interest rate close to market rates (with \nan average loan maturity of 10 years), and address the demand for housing improvement loans, \nwhich are currently unavailable in the market.21 The UMRC will address a fundamental market \nconstraint that is preventing banks from expanding their housing finance portfolios, by better \nmatching their assets and liabilities.22 The UMRC will provide loans to participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) that are secured by eligible mortgage loans, based on criteria that will assess \nproduct  design,  market-based  pricing,  underwriting  practices,  loan  documentation,  and \nperformance. This will help to professionalize the overall housing finance industry and address \nthe risks associated with broadening access to housing finance across new borrower segments.23 \nEligibility criteria will also target end-beneficiaries that are currently underserved by the banking \nsector. In the medium to long term, the UMRC will support more exponential sector growth by \n                                                \n20 The Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in the Appendix 2) contains the proposed \neligibility criteria with respect to the participating financial institutions (PFIs) and subloans to be refinanced. \n21 The UMRC expects to onlend proceeds from the ADB loan at a fixed rate of 13% to the PFIs, which is very competitive \nwhen compared to banks\u2019 other sources of funding. The PFIs will onlend these funds to end-borrowers at a maximum \nspread of 5% for mortgage loans and 4% for home improvement loans. Mortgage market rates currently stand at \nabout 21%\u201323% per annum for an average tenor of 7 years. \n22 Further information on the objectives and roles that the UMRC is expected to play in the financial markets can be \nfound in the Overview of the Uzbekistan Mortgage Refinancing Company (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n23 An MRC is a wholesale financial institution providing long-term finance to mortgage lenders. It raises funds with long \ntenors from various sources (such as the government and bilateral and multilateral development finance institutions) \nand by issuing bonds in the capital markets. With the proceeds, an MRC provides long-term loans to participating \ncommercial banks and housing finance companies. It bridges the maturity mismatch that mortgage lenders face \nwhen trying to do long-term lending using their short-term deposits. The business model of an MRC, like the proposed \nUMRC, is low risk. The refinancing loans are fully matched by the bond issues so there is no asset\u2013liability mismatch. \nLoans are over-collateralized (typically 110%\u2013125%) by a mortgage loan portfolio pledged by the banks that must \nmeet strict quality criteria, which reduces credit risk. \n \n ", "6 \nusing new debt instruments such as corporate bonds, covered bonds, and/or mortgage-backed \nsecurities to mobilize long-term funds from institutional investors.24 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition and  lessons learned.  The  program  will  address  underlying \nhousing finance market constraints that have inhibited its growth and sustainability. It will build on \nthe foundations established under the two prior ADB rural housing programs, which have helped \nbuild the capacity of the domestic housing construction industry and stimulated the development \nof an emerging mortgage lending industry, largely under government-sponsored programs.25 Prior \nprogram support has served to gradually expand the number of banks providing residential \nmortgage loans; however, the programs\u2019 impact and scale were constrained by the limited \navailable fiscal resources. Therefore, the program is a logical continuation of ADB\u2019s work to reform \nthe mortgage sector (and an acknowledgement of the limitations of the prior subsidized approach \nto market development).26 The program will also help establish an institutional framework and \nempirical benchmarks to improve access to housing for low- and middle-income households.27 \n \n19.  The program fits within broader ADB engagement to improve the government\u2019s fiscal and \nfinancial management capacity and strengthen the banking sector (particularly its supervision \nframeworks) under the Economic Management Improvement Program;28 and to develop the \ndomestic capital markets (under a forthcoming ADB intervention) to diversify the banking sector\u2019s \nfunding sources, reduce financing costs, and improve its management of risk\u2014paving the way \ntoward broadening the banking sector\u2019s business development potential and facilitating enhanced \nmarket activity (including the UMRC\u2019s expected future issuance of advanced capital market \ninstruments, such as covered bonds and mortgage-backed securities).29 The combination of \npolicy reforms and local currency support for banks (via the UMRC) under the program will \nintroduce international good practices into the housing finance sector. Further, ADB currently \nprovides hands-on support to operationalize the UMRC through a TA of $500,000, financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund.30 \n                                                \n24 The establishment of a wholesale mortgage finance provider of long-term funds raised on the capital market has \noccurred in various countries, both developed and developing, always with support from the government for the initial \nramp-up phase. \n25 ADB. 2011.

The HAU (to be established under the program) \nwill build the government\u2019s capacity to streamline housing finance policies and programs and \nprioritize development partners\u2019 support in line with a consolidated development agenda. ADB \nhas been the lead partner in supporting a holistic approach to development of the sector to date \n(prior ADB support identified in footnote 25). Additional development partners\u2019 support has been \nconcentrated on (i) expanding the supply of housing and its associated infrastructure (i.e., the \nIslamic Development Bank\u2019s contribution of $300 million under the State Affordable Rural Housing \nProgram); (ii) strengthening regulations and building codes for, and improving access to, cost- \nand energy-saving technology for lower-income housing (i.e., the United Nations Development \nProgramme); and (iii) upgrading the real property registration and cadaster system (i.e., the World \nBank). Further, ADB has coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and addresses \nsome of its recommendations in the program design.31, 32 These include recommendations to \nprioritize reforms that address market distortions and promote private sector development. The \nprogram  will  carry  out  this  agenda  through  rationalizing  fiscal  expenditures  and  improving \ngovernance and business incentives in the housing sector to unlock market growth. The IMF\u2019s \nadvisory support to the government is primarily focused on tax reforms and improvement of \nmacroeconomic data collection, analysis, and dissemination systems. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Investment and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The overall annual financing need for the housing sector is estimated to amount to about \n$2.2 billion.33 Given that about 44,000 housing units are projected to be built annually from 2019\u2013\n2023 (under the various government housing programs at an assumed average housing unit cost \nof SUM140 million to SUM200 million), the cost to the government per year is estimated to be \nfrom SUM4,488 billion ($476 million equivalent) to SUM6,600 billion ($700 million equivalent) \ndepending on the mix of housing unit prices.34 The estimated shortfall between the government \nbudget allocations and the overall housing sector financing needs therefore amounts to $1.5 \nbillion\u2013$1.8 billion per year. The program will mobilize private sector financing to reduce the \nsector\u2019s reliance on fiscal expenditures to address this shortfall, and introduce the structural \nreforms required to rationalize subsidy programs and related expenditures.  \n \n22.  The government has requested a concessional loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the PBL component of the program. The PBL will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace \nperiod and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement \nfor the PBL. The government has also requested a regular loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the FIL component of the program. The FIL will have a \n20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 \nyears, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The PBL will be disbursed over a period \nof 3 years in two tranches of equal amounts against achievement of policy actions under tranches \n                                                \n31  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 IMF. 2019.

The financing plan of the program is in Table 1. \n \n23.  The PBL loan size is based on the country\u2019s financing needs, the development impact of \nthe policy reform package, and development spending arising from the key reforms, totaling \n$1,697 million in 2019. In accommodating the need for development spending, the government \nenvisions covering the state budget deficit, expected at 1.1% of GDP ($517 million equivalent) in \n2019, through external borrowing (78% of deficit) and the issuance of domestic securities.35 36 \n \n24.  The investment component supported by a FIL is estimated to cost $162 million. The FIL \nof $150 million is provided to fund the proposed UMRC.37 The UMRC will be established (output \n3) as a joint-stock company with a paid-in capital eventually expected to reach SUM100 billion.38 \nThe company will start its operations with an initial capital of SUM25 billion (about $3 million, as \nreflected in the summary financing plan) to be contributed in full by the government.39 As a policy \ncondition under tranche 2, the government will invite commercial banks to invest the remaining \nSUM75 billion in the UMRC.

The business plan benefited from the results and feedback that ADB received \nthrough a comprehensive survey conducted among the commercial banks in Uzbekistan. \n38  While the UMRC will be established prior to the program approval, it will not, however, be operational at the time of \nthe ADB\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 approval. \n39 This is based on an exchange rate of SUM1.00 to $0.00010621 (as of 24 September 2019). \n40 Information on the UMRC\u2019s business strategy, its projected financial and operational performance, governance \npractices, credit and risk management policies, eligibility criteria for PFIs and subborrowers, and relending rates are \nin the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 The UMRC will charge a spread above its funding costs to cover operational expenses. Initially, the UMRC will add \nup to 100 basis points to cover these expenses and, once refinance volumes increase to sustainable levels, this \nspread may be reduced over time once UMRC\u2019s operations expand and mature. \n42 See Linked Documents for the Sector Assessment and Overview of the UMRC for more information (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  Disbursement  of  tranche  1  of  the  PBL  is  expected  to  be  made  shortly  after  loan \neffectiveness, following completion of all tranche 1 policy actions. The PBL closing date is 31 July \n2021. \n \n26.  The FIL of $150 million will be disbursed concurrently with the achievement of the UMRC\u2019s \nbusiness growth targets (i.e., based on identified eligible PFIs and their submission of qualified \nsubloans). The UMRC will submit withdrawal requests to ADB based on a maximum 6-month \nprojected disbursement schedule, as submitted by PFIs.43 The FIL closing date is 31 July 2023, \nin line with the implementation period of the program (Table 2). \n \n27.  Of the $150 million FIL to the UMRC, which will be disbursed through the MOF, the UMRC \nwill have the option to classify up to $20 million as subordinated debt (i.e., qualified as tier 2 \ncapital). This allocation will strengthen the balance sheet of the UMRC, stimulate confidence in \nits credit standing as a strong corporate entity and an eventual bond issuer, and enhance the \nsustainability of the mortgage refinancing model. \n \n28.  The loan proceeds will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n29.  The TA will (i) support the implementation of the policy actions under tranche 2 of the PBL; \n(ii) help strengthen the UMRC\u2019s capacity in mortgage loan underwriting and monitoring (by \nworking closely with the operational and credit units of the company); and (iii) support a gender \nsensitivity analysis of the government\u2019s housing finance programs and the UMRC\u2019s activities, and \nassist in the creation of a specialized sex-disaggregated database.45 The TA will finance the \nmobilization of an advisor to the UMRC to provide hands-on support to credit officer(s) and \nrefinance business officer(s) of the company. The advisor will guide, coach, and train officers on \nall business processes (e.g., handling requests for a refinance loan from a bank, undertaking the \ndue diligence process of the prospective bank, processing the approval and disbursement of \nfunding, and monitoring the PFIs and the quality and sufficiency of the refinanced subloans). The \nadvisor  will also  work with the company to implement a comprehensive public awareness \ncampaign to stimulate demand for the new housing finance products that the UMRC will help \nbring to the market in partnership with the banking sector. The MOF will be the executing agency \nfor the TA, which will be implemented from January 2020 to December 2021.46 The TA is \nestimated to cost $850,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, logistical \nsupport, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n30.  The benefits of the program considerably outweigh the costs. The program will facilitate \nthe phasing out of a costly and inefficient government-subsidized approach to mortgage market \ndevelopment. By intermediating access to long-term local currency-denominated funding, the \nUMRC will stimulate a transition to market-based finance solutions for commercially viable \nsegments of the mortgage market and help expand the banking sector\u2019s mortgage lending \ncapacity to address growing needs.47 Reforms under the program will rationalize the current \nhousing subsidy policies and programs to progressively reduce market distortions by introducing \nneeds-based income-linked subsidies, rather than the current interest-linked subsidies. These will \nhave direct economic benefits by (i) reducing the fiscal burden, estimated at 79% of the cost per \nhousing unit, and redirecting savings to other priority areas or reducing the budget deficit; (ii) \nestablishing reliable empirical data and detailed analysis to refine targeting and the effectiveness \nof housing subsidy programs; and (iii) improving affordability and facilitating the introduction of \nnew lending instruments tailored to broader income segments (e.g., home improvement loans, \nwhich are currently not available in the market despite strong demand, estimated at 25% of the \nUMRC\u2019s refinancing business), and thereby broadening access to housing finance. \n \n                                                \n45 The transaction TA will build on the outputs of (i) knowledge and support TA of $560,000 for the Mortgage Market \nDevelopment Program, which produced the business plan for the UMRC and the road map for regulatory changes \nrequired to ensure market uptake (Technical Assistance Special Fund [TASF 6 and TASF-other sources]); and (ii) \nTA of $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nto support the operationalization of the UMRC. \n46 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n47 About 40,000 mortgage loans were provided in 2018, of which 75% by number and 72% by volume fell under the \nvarious government housing programs; this compares poorly with the estimated annual demand of 145,000 housing \nunits. \n ", "11 \n31.  The financial viability of the FIL is based on a thorough analysis of market data, a sound \nunderstanding of the local context drawn from inputs across all key stakeholders, the proposed \nbusiness strategy and model, and lessons from similar companies operating in other countries. \nThe UMRC will require an initial paid-in capital of SUM25 billion, which the government will provide \nto commence operations. Capital is expected to double to SUM50 billion within 12 months once \nthe most active commercial banks in mortgage lending invest in the company. A further increase \nin capital to SUM100 billion has likewise been projected in line with the expected business growth \nand development of the company. The final shareholding structure is expected to be 25% \ngovernment (through the MOF) and 75% commercial banks. \n \n32.  The UMRC will operate as a wholesale lending institution dealing with relatively few but \nlarge financial transactions. Operations will initially be funded through credit lines (starting with \nADB\u2019s $150 million loan) and subsequently through corporate bond issuances\u2014sequentially with \nthe growth and progress of the capital markets and as the size of the underlying mortgage loan \nportfolio grows. Based on the UMRC\u2019s business plan, the company is projected to remain \nprofitable with an average annual growth in profit before tax of 28% during the period of 2020\u2013\n2024 (i.e. its first 5 years of operation). As reflected in the UMRC\u2019s return on assets ratio, which \nis expected to average 1.0% during its first 5 years, the company\u2019s profit margins will remain small \nto maintain competitive lending costs. The UMRC will use its resources efficiently by allocating its \nshareholders\u2019 capital contributions to offset operating expenses and maintain a solid return on \nequity ratio of 14% on average during its first 5 years, reflecting fast anticipated growth in volume \nof refinancing because of strong demand. Based on the business strategy and conservative \nestimates (identified in the company business plan, see Supplementary Linked Document 12), \nthe UMRC will begin refinance activities starting with a market share of 15% in the first year of \noperations and increasing to 22% over 5 years.48 In the base-case scenario, the UMRC is forecast \nto earn an after-tax profit of SUM7.4 billion in the first year of operations, i.e. 2020, rising to \nSUM13.2 billion in 2024.49 \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n33.  Regulations will be introduced under the program to enhance the supervision and ensure \nthe sustainability of the UMRC\u2019s operations by facilitating the company\u2019s raising of long-term \nfunds (i.e., by allowing institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies in \nUzbekistan to invest in highly rated and liquid debt securities, including those issued by wholesale \nlenders), and to align regulations for bond market issuances with international standards.50 \nFurther, the HAU will steer the government\u2019s housing subsidy policy framework and programs to \nenable  a  coordinated  and  sustainable  approach. The  HAU  will  lead  the  consolidation  and \nvalidation  of  housing  sector  data,  establish  a  database  of  beneficiaries,  and  monitor  the \neffectiveness of ongoing government housing programs. Under the second tranche of the PBL, \nthe HAU is expected to become an independent housing agency with a mandate to develop, \ncoordinate,  and  manage  all  housing  subsidy  programs  in  Uzbekistan.  It  will  facilitate  a \nfundamental change in the premise of government subsidy programs toward transparent up-front \nsubsidies to low-income households and will help reduce the fiscal burden and re-prioritize public \nexpenditures. To smoothen the transition to market lending rates, the ADB program will support \n                                                \n48 MRCs typically refinance no more than 25% of total outstanding mortgage loans because of banks\u2019 preference for \ncheaper deposit-based funding, which would suggest about SUM435 billion ($46 million equivalent, as of 11 October \n2019) on the current commercial mortgage outstanding debt. \n49 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n50 The UMRC will support capital market development as it begins to issue corporate bonds and more sophisticated \nproducts over time, by providing a safe investment channel for institutional investors. \n ", "12 \nthe introduction of an income-linked up-front subsidy program to address the affordability stress \ncaused by high interest rates and will support access to commercially priced mortgage products. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n34.  The UMRC will be regulated by the CBU and will follow its capital requirements and \nprudential regulations. The Capital Market Development Agency will regulate the issuance of \nsecurities issued by the UMRC. The UMRC may follow different regulatory requirements than \nthose applicable to banks because of its specialized business functions. ADB will conduct integrity \ndue diligence as soon as the UMRC has been incorporated. \n \n35.  The UMRC will have a seven-member supervisory board, of which two directors will be \nindependent. All directors of the supervisory board will have to be knowledgeable in the areas of \nbanking, mortgage finance, and/or housing. The company will be staffed with a professional team \nof  10\u201312.  Noncore  functions  such  as  marketing,  research,  and  human  resources  may  be \noutsourced. \n \n36.  ADB will review and approve the financial and integrity due diligence of the first three \ncommercial banks to be included in the program as PFIs to ascertain the UMRC\u2019s ability to \nmanage the PFI selection process. ADB will also review the first three loans from the UMRC to \nPFIs. Thereafter, ADB will decide whether the PFI review and selection process can be delegated \nto  the  UMRC  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Operations  Manual  section  on  financial \nintermediation loans based on (i) ADB's overall assessment of the UMRC\u2019s performance, (ii) the \nUMRC\u2019s PFI appraisal and selection standards, (iii) its loan portfolio quality, (iv) its management \nstrength, (v) the quality of its annual audited project financial statements submitted to ADB, and \n(vi) its capacity to monitor the potential PFIs\u2019 environmental and social safeguard screening \nprocedures.51 The UMRC will have the ultimate responsibility to verifying and assuring the \neligibility of the subborrowers and their mortgage loans funded by the FIL. \n \n37.  Based on preliminary due diligence, the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk \nof the program is expected to be high, primarily because the UMRC will have substantial start-up \nrisks as a new entity. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and the MOF, and will be discussed with the UMRC Board, \nmanagement team and staff, once established, and each PFI, once selected. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in paragraph 67 of the PAM.52 \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n38.  The  program  will  serve  to  lower  borrowing  costs  and  incentivize  PFIs  to  lend  to \nunderserved market segments, further enabling market growth and improving access to housing \nfor lower- and middle-income households. Lending covenants for the project (FIL) will include \neligibility  criteria  for  PFIs  and  their  onlending  operations  to  expand  access  to  commercial \nmortgage finance.53 The SDP program will tackle key market constraints, which make borrowing \nprohibitively expensive and facilitate the introduction of lending products adjusted to different \nborrower risk profiles. Broader access to housing finance will contribute to improving the living \n                                                \n51 ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. OM D6.

In addition, the policy \nreforms introduced with the support of the program will have more targeted pro-poor housing \nassistance initiatives that benefit the low- and informal income-earning population.  \n \n39.  Based on the independent evaluation of ADB\u2019s first rural housing program (footnote 25), \n22% of the 22,284 beneficiaries of the said program were women.54 At least 30% of the UMRC\u2019s \nfunded loan portfolio must be provided to eligible women borrowers, per ADB\u2019s requirement.55 \nTherefore, the program will foster increased home ownership among women through the ADB \nFIL and the TA. The program is classified as having some gender elements under ADB\u2019s \nguidelines. The loan and project agreements include covenants on labor standards and safety. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n40.  Given  the  nature  of  the  intervention,  all  three  safeguard  categories  (environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) are classified C under the PBL and FI-C under \nthe FIL.56 The program is expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and is \nunlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The UMRC\u2019s \nfunding of the PFIs will not finance real estate development or mass housing construction but will \nbe used to refinance loans provided to individuals to purchase new housing units or to acquire \nand/or renovate existing homes. The UMRC will not provide any mortgage loans; it will instead \nrefinance  mortgage  loan  portfolios  of  its  PFIs.  Consequently,  the  UMRC  will  set  up  an \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) as part of the PAM. The UMRC ESMS \nwill require it to ensure that PFIs have a screening process as part of their ESMSs\u2014acceptable \nto ADB\u2014in place or will establish one prior to any disbursements.
