The loan is to be provided under \nthe  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) as a single tranche. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nTheme (subtheme): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability) \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n \nCategory C \n\n \nThe global crisis, which intensified after September 2008, has affected \nthe  Philippine  economy  and  social  sectors  in  four  related  respects: \n(i) the first-round effects of the global financial crisis had repercussions \nfor  the  domestic  financial  sector  in  the  second  half  of  2008;  (ii)  the \nsecond-round  effects  of  devastated  global  demand  has  hurt  the  real \neconomy, sharply lowering its growth prospects for 2009; (iii) the impact \non  fiscal  policy  has  resulted  in  declining  tax  revenue  collection  and  a \nlarger  government  budget  deficit  than  initially  projected,  at  a  time  of \nlimited access to global credit markets; and (iv) the economic and fiscal \npolicy impacts threaten to undo recent gains in social policy spending, \nunemployment reduction, and poverty reduction programs.  \n\nGiven  the  second-round  effects  on  the  real  economy  and  emerging \nfiscal  constraint,  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  asked  ADB  to \nprovide  a  countercyclical  support  loan  of  $500 million  to  support  its \npublic  expenditure  program  for  2009.  The  Government  is  concerned \nabout  its  ability  to  ensure  predictability  in  budget  financing  as  it  has \nalready  provided  a  temporary  fiscal  stimulus  within  its  medium-term \nfiscal program. The Government projects gross financing requirements \nfor 2009 at P451 billion in domestic financing and $4.3 billion in external \nfinancing,  including  domestic  and  external  debt  that  matures  in  2009. \nThe  Government's  external  debt  amortization  profile  is  projected  to \nremain relatively high in 2010 with as much as $6.0 billion maturing in \n2010. Therefore, the countercyclical support loan will provide additional \nfinancing  to  the  Government  for  its  needed  larger  fiscal  stimulus.  This \nwill allow the Government to stimulate an economic recovery, protect its \nsocial  spending  and  poverty  reduction  programs,  and  continue  with  its \nlonger-term development objectives in 2009.   \n\nThe Government announced its countercyclical expenditure program in \n2009  and  integrated  it  into  the  2009  budget.  Since  the  national \ngovernment  budget  does  not  have  automatic  stabilizers  embedded  on \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \nii \n \n\n \n\ninclude \n\nthe expenditure side, the countercyclical program was needed to focus \non advancing infrastructure projects already in the investment pipeline, \nscale  up  social  assistance  and  public  employment  programs,  and \nimplement policy measures to expedite budget disbursements. Overall, \nnoninterest  expenditure  is  programmed  to  rise  by  20%  in  2009  over \n2008,  providing  a  much-needed  boost  to  the  economy.  The  2009 \nnational budget substantially increases spending on the social sectors; \nthis  will  help  mitigate  adverse  impacts  of  the  economic  contraction  on \nthe poor. The proposed loan will support the Government's ongoing and \nscaled  up  social  assistance  programs  and  infrastructure  programs  in \nthe social sector and agriculture. \n \nThe  Government  has  scaled  up  its  social  assistance  and  poverty \nreduction  programs  to  protect  the  most  vulnerable  from  the  effects  of \nthe  economic  contraction.  These  programs \nthe  hunger \nmitigation  program,  self-employment  assistance  kaunlaran  (SEA-K) \nprogram,  food  for  school  program,  family-based  conditional  cash \ntransfer  program  (CCT),  community-based  development  program \n(KALAHI),  and  comprehensive  livelihood  and  emergency  employment \nprogram (CLEEP). These social assistance programs are implemented \nwithin the framework of the Government's 2007 national social welfare \nframework, \nprogram.  Under \nthe  National  Economic  and \nthis \nDevelopment  Authority \nintroduced  a  national  definition  of  social \nprotection  and  identified  types  of  programs  covered.  In  2008  the \nGovernment  established  an  institutional  framework  for  enhanced \ndelivery of social protection programs that specifically assigns operating \nresponsibilities  of \nthe \nDepartment of Social Welfare and Development. \n \nSpending on infrastructure also increased and procurement advanced. \nThe  2009  budgets  for  key  infrastructure  agencies  were  significantly \nincreased. In real terms, the Department of Public Works and Highways \nthe  Department  of \nbudget \nAgriculture's  budget  rose  by  52%.  To  ensure  the  Government's \ncountercyclical  program  would  be  timely  and  effective  by  the  second \nsemester  of  2009,  these  agencies  agreed  to  obligate  at  least  60%  of \ntheir total 2009 spending program during the first semester of 2009.  \n \nSupport  for  the  countercyclical  expenditure  program  is  anchored  by \nADB\u2019s  existing  loan  programs  to  the  Philippines,  especially  policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  under  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram (DPSP) approved in February 2007. The DPSP, structured as \na  program  cluster  comprising  three  single  tranche  operations  (or \nsubprograms) over 2006\u20132009, focuses on a broad policy agenda that \naddresses thematic and cross-cutting issues in four core areas: (i) fiscal \nsustainability  and  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii) governance  in  public \nfinancial management (PFM) and anticorruption in key revenue-raising \nagencies,  (iii)  the  investment  climate,  and  (iv)  enhancement  of  human \ncapital  and  social  inclusion.  The  third  subprogram  (scheduled  to  be \nsubmitted to the ADB Board of Directors for consideration in September \n2009)  includes  a  postprogram  monitoring  framework  for  12  months  to \n\nthe  National  Social  Welfare  Program \n\nincreased  by  13%  over  2008  and \n\nto \n\n\f \n\niii \n\ncreate the basis for continuous policy dialogue and engagement during \nthe  critical  period  of  2009/10  prior  to  the  formulation  of  a  new \ngovernment after the Philippine presidential elections in May 2010. \n \nThe  loan  is  to  provide  support  for  the  Government's  countercyclical \nexpenditure  program  for  2009  and  therefore  ensure  predictability  in  its \nbudget  financing  given  the  necessity  for  temporary  fiscal  expansion. \nThis  will  allow  the  Government  to  stimulate  the  economic  recovery, \nprotect  its  social  spending  and  poverty  reduction  programs  and \nobjectives, and continue with its longer-term development objectives in \n2009.   \n\nthe \n\nlocal  currency  counterpart \n\nA loan of $500,000,000 under the Countercyclical Support Facility from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB's London \ninterbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have \na  5-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility plus \n200  basis  points  (bps),  a  commitment  charge  of  75  bps  on  the \nundisbursed loan balance, and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.  \n \nThe  loan  will  be  used  to  support  the  Government's  countercyclical \nexpenditure  program  implemented  from  February  2009  to  December \n2010,  the  end  period  specified  for  the  countercyclical  support  facility; \nthe  single  tranche  loan  of  $500  million  is  to  be  disbursed  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  \n \nfunds \nThe  Government  will  use \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n \nDepartment of Finance \n \nThe  coordinating  committee,  initiated  under  the  Development  Policy \nSupport  Program  and  chaired  by \nthe  Department  of  Finance \nundersecretary,  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  implementation  of \nthe  Government's  countercyclical  expenditure  program  together  with \nthe  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  and  National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority.  The  committee  will  meet  semi-\nannually  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  program  implementation. \nADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998). \n \n\n \n\nObjective, Scope \nand Coverage of \nLoan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \n\n\f \niv \n \n\nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nThe economy and the poor are beneficiaries:  \n\n(i)  Higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \n\nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n\n(ii)  Improved  social  sector  outcomes  will  result  from  increased \ntargeted  social  assistance  programs;  and \nspending;  better \nimplementation of the CCT program linked to better outcomes for \nchild  education  and  health,  and  the  comprehensive  livelihood \nemployment  and  emergency  employment  program  (providing \ncrisis-related relief to unemployed workers). \n\n(iii) The \n\nreduction  of \n\nthe  budget \n\nfinancing  gap  will  support \n\nmacroeconomic stability within the medium-term fiscal program. \n \n\nThe  loan  supplements  financing  from  other  ADB  programs  such  as  the \nproposed third subprogram of the DPSP. The DPSP is firmly embedded \nin  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010;  the \nPhilippines  Development  Forum;  and  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  sector \nstrategies  covering  its  fiscal  program,  tax  administration  reform,  PFM, \nprocurement  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  rural  development, \nand social protection. \n\n \n\nRisks include the following:  \n\n(i)  The  global  financial  crisis  has  hurt  the  Philippines.  A  prolonged \nglobal recession and dysfunctional credit markets will place further \nstress  on  the  fiscal  situation  and  the  budget  financing  gap  as \nabout  $8.4  billion  of  external  public  debt  matures  in  2009  and \n2010.  The  economic  slowdown,  coupled  with  a  decline  in \nremittances,  will  result  in  increased  poverty  incidence  in  2009. \nHowever, this will be partially offset through the scaling up of the \nCCT,  implementation  of  the  CLEEP  and  other  social  assistance \nprograms, and increase of infrastructure development in 2009 and \n2010. \n\n(ii)  The  absorptive  capacity  of  key  spending  agencies  may  be \nstretched  impacting  the  timeliness  and  effectiveness  of  the \ncountercyclical  expenditure  program.  The  Government  has \nintroduced  several  policy  measures  to  expedite  disbursements \nand this will mitigate some of these constraints. \n\n(iii) Some  social  assistance  programs  and \n\ninfrastructure  are \nvulnerable  to  leakages,  poor  targeting,  and  corruption.  The \nGovernment  is  committed  to  addressing  these  problems  through \ninstruments  such  as  public  financial  reforms  and  procurement. \nThe  Government  Procurement  Policy  Board  continues  to  make \nsubstantial  progress  in  implementing  the  Procurement  Reform \nLaw  of  2003  and  its  3-year  action  plan  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  framework;  capacity  development  of  procurement \nofficers;  and  enforcement  of  the  law,  including  the  expansion  of \nthe  electronic  procurement  portal  (PhilGEPS),  which  aims  to \nincrease  transparency  and  enhance  competition  in  procurement. \nincludes \nThe  Procurement  Transparency  Group,  which \ngovernment  agencies  and  major  civil  society  organizations  as \nmembers,  was  established  to  track  and  monitor  the  procurement \nof selected infrastructure projects. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  Countercyclical  Support  (PHI-CS).  The  Development \nPolicy Letter confirming the Government's countercyclical expenditure program and its medium-\nterm  development  program  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  status of  the  Government's  compliance  with \nthe access criteria is in Appendix 2. \n \n\nII. \n\n REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT \n\nFACILITY  \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  loan  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comes at a critical time for the Philippines. It is designed to maintain \nmomentum  of  the  country\u2019s  key  development  efforts  at  a  challenging  time  of  global  financial \nmarket  failure  and  the  first  global  recession  since  World  War II.  The  global  crisis,  which \nintensified after September 2008, has affected the Philippine economy and social sectors in four \nrelated  respects:  (i)  the  first-round  effects  of  the  global  financial  crisis  impacted  the  domestic \nfinancial  sector  in  the  second  half  of  2008;  (ii) the  second-round  effects  of  reduced  global \ndemand  have  hurt  the  real  economy  and  may  have  put  the  Philippines  in  an  economic \nrecession  in  the  first  half  of  2009;  (iii)  the  impact  on  fiscal  policy  has  resulted  in  declining  tax \nrevenue  and  a  larger  government  budget  deficit  than  initially  projected,  at  a  time  of  limited \naccess to global credit markets; and (iv) the economic and fiscal policy impacts threaten to undo \nrecent  gains  in  social  policy  spending,  unemployment  reduction,  and  poverty  reduction \nprograms.  \n\n3. \nGiven the second-round effects on the real economy and the emerging fiscal constraint, \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  asked  ADB  to  provide  a  countercyclical  support  loan  (PHI-\nCS)  of  $500  million  to  support  its  2009  public  expenditure  program,  including  its  ongoing  and \nscaled  up  social  assistance  and  emergency  employment  programs,  among  others.  The \nGovernment  is  concerned  about  ensuring  predictability  in  its  budget  financing,  given  the \nnecessity for temporary fiscal stimulus within the medium-term fiscal program. The Government \nprojects gross financing requirements for 2009 at P451.8 billion in domestic financing and $4.3 \nbillion  in  external  financing,  including  domestic  and  external  debt  that  matures  in  2009.  The \nGovernment's  external  debt  amortization  profile  is  projected  to  remain  relatively  high  in  2010, \nwith  as  much  as  $6.0  billion  maturing  in  2010  (Table  4).  Therefore,  the  loan  will  provide \nadditional financing to the Government for the larger fiscal stimulus now needed. \n\nThe  Government  has  met  the  access  criteria  under  the  CSF  (Appendix  2).1 First,  the \n4. \neconomy has been adversely impacted by the global economic crisis. This impact is manifested \nin  several  ways.  Economic  growth  contracted  by  2.3%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  on  a \nseasonally  adjusted  quarter-on-quarter  basis,  and  the  index  of  leading  economic  indicators \nsuggests the economy  may have continued to contract in the second quarter. The collapse in \nexports  and  stagnant  inflows  of  remittances  were  the  key  factors  behind  this  sharper  than \nexpected economic contraction. The Philippines is also experiencing temporary fiscal constraint \nbecause  of  the  economic  slowdown.  Tax  revenue  collection  declined  by  5.2%  in  the  first  6 \nmonths  of  2009  compared  with  10%  growth  in  2008.  The  2009  national  government  budget \ndeficit is now projected to widen from the original programmed deficit of 0.5% of GDP to 3.2%, \nstill relatively low by international standards, reflecting the Government's cautious fiscal stance.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nSecond, the Government continues to maintain sound macroeconomic management of \n5. \nthe  increased  downside  risks  to  the  economy  arising  from  the  global  financial  crisis.  This  is \nreflected in a strong external balance with gross international reserves equivalent to 6.3 months \nof  import  cover,  a  low  inflation  environment,  and  a  sound  and  liquid  banking  system.  The \nGovernment  has  operated  primary  budget  surpluses  for  the  past  3  years,  and  reduced \nnonfinancial public sector debt from more than 101.0% of GDP in 2003 to 59.9% in 2008. While \npublic debt is broadly sustainable, it is vulnerable to exchange rate risks as 40% of public debt \nis denominated in foreign currencies (Appendix 3).  \n \n6. \nThird,  the  Government  has  announced  a  countercyclical  expenditure  program  and \nincorporated  it  into  the  2009  budget  enacted  in  February  2009.  The  program  focuses  on \nadvancing  infrastructure  projects  already  in  the  Government's  investment  pipeline,  scaling  up \nsocial assistance (such as the conditional cash transfer program CCT) and public employment \nprograms,  implementing  the  CLEEP  program,  and  introducing  policy  measures  to  expedite \nbudget disbursements. Overall, noninterest expenditure is programmed to rise by 20% in 2009 \nover 2008, providing a much-needed boost to the economy in the second half of 2009.  \n \n7. \nThe  PHI-CS  loan  is  anchored  by  ADB\u2019s  existing  loan  programs  to  the  Philippines  and \nespecially through policy dialogue with the Government under the Development Policy Support \nProgram (DPSP) approved by the ADB Board of Directors in February 2007 (Appendix 4). The \nDPSP  is  structured  as  a  program  cluster  comprising  three  single-tranche  operations  (three \nsubprograms over 2006\u20132009) with a well-defined, medium-term framework. Policy triggers (or \nexpected prior actions) for subsequent subprograms ensures continuous dialogue between the \nGovernment, ADB, other development partners, and stakeholders. The DPSP aims to help the \nGovernment achieve its medium- to long-term goals of sustained high economic growth, lower \nunemployment,  and  poverty  reduction.  It  focuses  on  a  broad  policy  agenda  that  addresses \nthematic and crosscutting issues in four core areas: (i) fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic \nstability,  (ii)  governance  in  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and  anticorruption  in  key \nrevenue-raising  agencies,  (iii) investment  climate,  and  (iv)  enhancement  of  human  capital  and \nsocial  inclusion.  These  are  all  key  outcomes  and  outputs  of  the  ADB  country  strategy  and \nprogram 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines.2 \n \nUnder subprogram 1 of the DPSP, the Government implemented a series of measures \n8. \nto  address  the  fiscal  imbalance,  resulting  in  a  swift  and  impressive  turnaround  in  the  fiscal \nsituation and improved macroeconomic stability in 2006 and 2007. Subprogram 2 for 2008 built \non  reforms  initiated  under  subprogram  1  for  fiscal  consolidation  and  strengthening  of \nfiscal \ngovernance \nconsolidation  and  provided  much  needed  fiscal  space  for  increasing  spending  on  the  social \nsectors and infrastructure in 2007 and 2008. The third subprogram, scheduled to be submitted \nto  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  for  consideration  in  September  2009,  increases  the  focus  on  \n(i)  institutionalizing  governance  programs  such  as  the  anticorruption  revenue  programs  in  the \nBureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR)  and  Bureau  of  Customs  (BOC),  (ii)  the  investment  climate, \nand (iii) the social sectors. While the third subprogram is the final of the series, it includes a new \npostprogram  monitoring  framework  for  12 months  to  create  the  basis  for  continuous  policy \ndialogue  and  engagement  during  the  critical  2009/10  period  prior  to  the  formulation  of  a  new \ngovernment  after  the  Philippine  presidential  elections  in  May  2010.  The  monitoring  framework \nfocuses on the Government's short-term plan for advancing its reforms in fiscal policy, PFM, and \nselected areas in investment climate and poverty, supported by ADB, the Government of Japan, \nand  other  development  partners'  technical  and  program  assistance  (Appendix  5  provides  the \n\nin  PFM  and  procurement.

The impact on developing countries has varied, but generally the crisis \nadversely impacted access to global financial markets; and resulted in a sharp downturn in the \nreal  economy  with  ensuing  fiscal  stress,  and  higher  unemployment  and  poverty.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  projects  the  global  economy  will  contract  this  year  and  only \nmoderately  recover  next  year  as  financial  market  stabilization  will  take  longer  than  previously \nenvisaged.  Developing  country  access  to  international  credit  will  remain  curtailed  as  a \nconsequence.3  \n \n10. \nSpillovers  from  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the  Philippine  domestic  financial  sector\u2014\nespecially  banking\u2014have  been  relatively  muted  because  of  limited  exposure  to  troubled  US \nassets, and low exposure to securitization and off-balance-sheet activities. The banking system \nremains sound with a capital adequacy ratio at 14% and gross nonperforming loans at 3.6% as \nof the end of May 2009. The equity market was impacted with equity prices falling by as much \nas 50% in 2008, in line with the experience of regional neighbors; it has since stabilized.  \n \n11. \nHowever,  the  global  credit  crunch  that  emerged  in  September  2008  did  hurt  the \nPhilippines by making access to international debt markets more expensive, for both the public \nand  private  sectors.  Yields  on  medium-term  domestic  bonds  increased  by  nearly  350  basis \npoints (bps) in October 2008 and the Philippines\u2019 international bond spreads surged to 800 bps \non  24  October  2008.  The  Philippines  was  among  the  first  of  the  emerging  markets  to  reenter \nglobal  capital  markets  with  a  dollar  bond  issue  in  January  2009.  It  successfully  raised \n$1.5 billion  at  an  average  yield  of  8.5%,  an  increase  in  the  bond  spread  by  300  bps  over \nprecrisis levels. At that time, the Philippines took advantage of a liquid dollar domestic market \ndue  to  the  steady  inflow  of  remittances  and  a  collapse  in  the  demand  for  trade  finance,  with \nmore  than  40%  of  bond  issuance  taken  up  by  domestic  banks.  In  July  2009,  the  Government \nraised an additional $750.0 million at an average yield of 6.6%. While global credit markets have \nshown  signs  of  recovery  in  recent  months  and  spreads  have  started  to  decrease  toward \nprecrisis levels, global markets remain fragile and at the end of June 2009 spreads on Philippine \ninternational bonds increased again from an average spread of 270 bps in early June 2009 to \n320  bps  (Figure  1).  Also  indicative  of  elevated  risk,  the  yield  curve  on  sovereign  dollar \ndenominated bonds is much steeper in 2009 compared to its position in 2007 and early 2008.4  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3 International Monetary Fund. 2009.

The  second-round \neffects  of  the  global  recession  on  the  Philippine  economy  are  greater  than  the  impacts  of  the \n1997/98  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  economies  of  its  major  trading  partners  and  recipients  of \noverseas  Filipino  workers  have  entered  severe  recessions.  Consequently,  exports  (mainly \ninfluenced by the sharp contraction in exports of electronics) collapsed by 40% from December \n2008 to April 2009 on a year-on-year basis. As a result, the Philippine economy contracted by \n2.3%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  compared  with  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008  on  a  seasonally \nadjusted basis (Figure 1). Remittances have held up much better than trade in goods and other \nservices,  but  their  growth  virtually  stalled  with  2.5%  growth  in  the  first  4  months  of  2009 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n  \n\ncompared  with  15%  for  the  same  period  in  2008.

The  index  of  leading  economic \nindicators  produced  by  the  National  Statistical  Coordination  Board  points  to  an  increased \nprobability that the economy contracted in the second quarter of 2009 suggesting the economy \ncould be in recession. \n \n\n (a) GDP Growth and the Index of Leading Economic        (b) Spreads in Sovereign Dollar Bonds \n       Indicators (LEI) 2007 to 2009a   \n\n           (bps over US treasury bills)     \n\n \n\n     \n\nFigure 1: Key Economic and Financial Indicators \n\n%\n\n \nh\nt\n\nw\no\nr\ng\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\n-50\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\nI\n\nE\nL\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n8.2\n\n8.0\n\n7.8\n\n7.6\n\n7.4\n\n7.2\n\n7.0\n\n6.8\n\nQ1\n2007\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4 Q1\n2008\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4 Q1\n2009\n\nQ2\n\n0\n\nn\na\nJ\n-\n1\n\nb\ne\nF\n-\n1\n\nr\na\nM\n\n-\n1\n\nr\np\nA\n\n-\n1\n\ny\na\nM\n\n-\n1\n\nn\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\nl\n\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\ng\nu\nA\n\n-\n1\n\np\ne\nS\n\n-\n1\n\nt\nc\nO\n\n-\n1\n\nv\no\nN\n\n-\n1\n\nc\ne\nD\n\n-\n1\n\nn\na\nJ\n-\n1\n\nb\ne\nF\n-\n1\n\nr\na\nM\n\n-\n1\n\nr\np\nA\n\n-\n1\n\ny\na\nM\n\n-\n1\n\nn\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\nl\n\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\nGDP\n\nLEI\n\nPhilippines\n\nEast Asia\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\n (c) Growth in the Philippines' Exports and Imports \n      (% change, year-on-year) \n\n \n\n \n\n      (d) Unemployment Rate \n           (%, 4 quarter moving average) \n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n5\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\nJ\nu\n\nl\n\nO\nc\n\nt\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\nJ\nu\n\nl\n\nO\nc\n\nt\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\nJ\nu\n\nl\n\nO\nc\n\nt\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\nJ\nu\n\nl\n\nO\nc\n\nt\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n7\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n6\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\n2\n0\n0\n6\nq\n1\n\nq\n2\n\nq\n3\n\nq\n4\n\nq\n2\n\nq\n3\n\nq\n4\n\nq\n2\n\nq\n3\n\nq\n4\n\nq\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n7\nq\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n8\nq\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n9\nq\n1\n\nbps = basis points, GDP = gross domestic product, LEI = leading economic indicators. \na The index of leading economic indicators is a composite index of 11 economic indicators that are related to or can \ninfluence  the  economic  cycle.

With  this  background,  the  Government  revised  its  macroeconomic  framework  in  June \n2009  and  now  projects  growth  of  0.8%\u20131.8%  for  2009  (down  from  3.1%\u20134.1%  projected  in \nFebruary 2009), with higher unemployment and poverty rates. Development partners project a \nlower  growth  rate  ranging  from  \u22121.0%  to  1.0%  for  2009  because  of  faltering  exports,  stalling \nforeign  investments,  and  a  projected  drop  in  remittances.  However  because  of  its  lower  trade \nintensity,  the  Philippines\u2019  vulnerability  to  export  fluctuations  is  less  than  its  neighbors.  These \nprojections  translate  to  a  substantial  per  capita  income  decline  from  \u20130.2%  to  \u20133.0%  in  2009, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n \n\nthereby likely increasing poverty (para. 15).

It refers to the difference between actual economic growth and \npotential economic growth. A negative gap suggests actual growth below potential and vice versa. The Philippines\u2019 \npotential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates a nonlinear trend in \nthe economic growth data. The tax measures are specified as the percentage point change in the tax\u2013GDP ratio \nbetween  2  years.  As  is  apparent  from  the  figures,  tax  revenues  tend  to  be  moderately  pro-cyclical\u2014that  is\u2014tax \ncollections grow faster than nominal GDP during higher growth periods (implying an increase in the tax ratio) and \ndrop faster than nominal GDP during economic troughs (implying a fall in the tax ratio).  \n\nb  BIR tax collection refers to the growth in collection on year-on-year basis. GDP growth refers to quarter-on-quarter \n\ngrowth, seasonally adjusted.   \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank, Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance estimates. \n \n \nThe  global  financial  crisis  has  affected  fiscal  policy  in  three  ways.  First,  with  the \n14. \ncontraction in the economy, it is necessary for the Government to provide a modest stimulus in \n2009 while maintaining medium-term fiscal discipline. Second, the contraction in the economy in \nthe  first  quarter  of  2009  resulted  in  a  decline  in  tax  collections  of  about  5.2%  in  the  first  6 \nmonths  of  2009  over  the  same  period  in  2008, and  about  20%  below  its  original  2009  budget \ntarget  (Figure  2).5 The  decline  in  tax  collection  was  broad-based  across  most  types  of  taxes, \nalthough  the  drop  in  foreign  trade  tax  collection  was  larger  than  others.  Customs  collection \ndecreased by  8.3%  (of  which  value-added  tax  on  plummeting  imported  goods  fell  12.9%)  and \nBIR's collections fell by 5.1% on a year-on-year basis. ADB staff assessments indicate that tax \nrevenues  have  historically  exhibited  a  systematic,  moderate  pro-cyclical  pattern  in  the \nPhilippines, that is, during periods of fast economic growth, direct and indirect taxes grow faster \nthan nominal GDP; and during sharp slowdowns, taxes fall faster than nominal GDP. ADB staff \nestimates  based  on  a  low-growth  scenario  for  2009  and  2010  indicate  that  the  tax\u2013GDP  ratio \nwill decline for FY2009; some of the decline will carry over into 2010 as corporate tax losses are \ncarried  forward.  As  a  result  of  the  increased  spending  and  projected  decline  in  revenues,  the \n\n                                                 \n5   Precrisis  legislative  tax  measures,  such  as  increasing  the  tax  income  threshold  for  wage  earners  effective  July \n2008  and  reducing  the  corporate  income  tax  rate  from  35%  to  32%  effective  January  2009  as  mandated  in  the \n2005 legislation, are estimated to have lowered tax collection by about P36 billion in 2009.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n  \n\nGovernment  revised  its  fiscal  program  for  2009  and  projects  an  increased  deficit  from \nP68 billion  in  2008  to  P250  billion  in  2009,  or  3.2%  of  GDP  (Table  2).  Third,  tight  liquidity  in \nglobal  credit  markets  and  elevated  risks  have  increased  the  cost  of  financing  the  budget  and \nrefinancing public debt.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Government's Macroeconomic Management \n\n15. \nAppropriate and Responsive Policy. The Government's macroeconomic policy stance \nto the increased downside risks to the economy from the global crisis has been appropriate and \nresponsive.  Several  key  macroeconomic  indicators  showed  improvement  in  2009  over  2008.  \nOn the external side, the current account is in surplus of about 4.9% of GDP for the first quarter \nof  2009.  Gross  international  reserves  continue  to  accumulate  and  reached  $39.5 billion  at  the \nend of May 2009, equivalent to 6.3 months of import cover and three times higher than external \ndebt  maturing  this  year.  Conventionally,  at  least  3  months  of  import  coverage  is  considered  a \nsufficient buffer against modest shocks to the balance of payments. On the monetary side, the \nCentral Bank of the Philippines (BSP) has operated an appropriate and timely monetary policy \nstance  throughout  the  crisis.  In  early  2008  it  raised  interest  rates  to  counter  the  threat  of \nsecond-round  inflationary  pressures  arising  from  the  surge  in  global  commodity  prices.  It  then \nshifted to an expansionary monetary position at the end of 2008 to provide sufficient liquidity to \nthe banking system against the backdrop of rapidly falling inflation. The BSP currently maintains \na neutral monetary stance. Inflation fell to 0.2% (year-on-year) in July 2009, well below BSP's \ninflation target range of 2.5%\u20134.5% for 2009. Inflation is expected to remain benign for the rest \nof this year, indicative of the slump in domestic economic activity.  \n \nThe  Government's  response  to  mitigating  the  risk  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the \n16. \nPhilippine  financial  sector  involves  a  number  of  preemptive  measures  aimed  at  increasing \nliquidity in the domestic banking system, assuring confidence of depositors, and strengthening \nBSP's  lender  of  last  resort  facility.  These  measures  include  (i)  BSP  strengthened  its  lender  of \nlast resort facility by increasing its budget for the peso rediscounting facility from P20 billion to \nP40  billion  on  14  November  2008,  and  opened  a  dollar  repo  facility  on  20  October  2008  to \nensure  dollar  liquidity  with  the  banks\u2019  dollar-denominated  Philippine  sovereign  bonds  as \nunderlying  collateral;  (ii)  BSP  increased  liquidity  in  the  banking  system  by  easing  monetary \npolicy  including  reducing  the  reserve  requirement  by  2 percentage  points,  (iii)  BSP  allowed \nfinancial institutions to temporarily reclassify their investments in debt and equity securities; and \n(iv)  Congress  approved  an  increase  in  the  ceiling  on  deposit  insurance  from  P250,000  to \nP500,000 per depositor to more closely align with recent adjustments in deposit guarantees in \nthe  region;  With  these  preemptive  measures  in  place,  indicators  show  signs  of  improvement. \nBank liquidity eased at the end of 2008 and bank lending continued robust growth at about 20% \nin  the  first  quarter  of  2009  on  a  year-on-year  basis;  the  stock  market  and  the  peso  have \nstabilized  since  November;  and  yields  on  short-  and  medium-term  (3 months  to  5  years) \ndomestic  bonds  fell  back  to  precrisis  rates,  although  yields  on  longer-term  bonds  remain \nelevated. \n \n17. \nPublic  Finances.  With the sharp contraction in global demand since September 2008, \nand the recognition by the Government and development partners that a larger fiscal expansion \nis  necessary,  the  Government  revised  its  fiscal  program  for  2009.  It  now  projects  a  national \ngovernment  budget  deficit  of  3.2%  of  GDP  to  reflect  the  first  quarter  budget  outturn  and \nchanges  in  the  budget's  macroeconomic  assumptions  (Table  2).  The  revised  budget  deficit \n\n \n\n\ftranslates  to  an  actual  fiscal  expansion  of  up  to  2.3%  of  GDP  from  2008,6 low  by  regional \nstandards.7 It  covers  about  40%\u201350%  of  the  expected  negative  output  gap  this  year  (i.e.,  the \ngap between potential and actual economic growth), suggesting that the expansion will have a \nmoderate impact on mitigating the economic contraction (Appendix 6). \n \n18. \nThe Government has announced its revised medium term goal of a balanced budget and \ndecided it should be extended to 2013 instead of 2010 as originally planned, being aware of the \nneed to provide investors with a sign of its commitment to maintaining a credible fiscal program \nwith  clear  priorities.  It  targets  a  national  government  budget  deficit  of  2.5%  in  2010  (primarily \nachieved by cutting discretionary spending back to its medium-term spending targets), 1.5% in \n2011, and 0.5% in 2012; and a balanced budget by 2013. Recognizing its commitment to fiscal \nprudence  and  overall  sound  macroeconomic  management,  Moody's  upgraded  the  country\u2019s \nsovereign credit rating from Ba3 to Ba1 with a stable outlook. The upgrade was prompted by the \nrelatively high degree of resiliency in the banking system and the external balance-of-payments \nsituation. The other two major rating agencies maintained the 2008 Philippines\u2019 sovereign credit \nratings of BB\u2013 stable (Standard & Poor\u2019s) and BB stable (Fitch).  \n \n19. \nThe  medium-term  fiscal  targets  are  realistic  and  achievable,  but  will  require  increased \neffort to increase revenues by about 1 percentage point of GDP from 2010 to 2012. While the \ndecline  in  tax  collection  is  substantially  attributable  to  the  economic  contraction  in  the  first \nquarter  of  2009,  weak  tax  administration  and  inefficiencies  in  tax  policy  have  also  resulted  in \nBIR being unable to increase value-added tax collections through improvements in tax efficiency \nand enforcement. Increasing tax revenue collection is a long-term challenge for the Government. \nIts  approach  is  threefold:  (i)  implement  tax  administration  reforms;  (ii)  enhance  and \ninstitutionalize  anticorruption  initiatives  in  BIR  and  BOC;  and  (iii)  improve  tax  policies.  Some \nprogress  in  reforms  to  tax  administration  has  been  made  under  subprogram  3  of  the  DPSP, \nalbeit  gradual  and  incremental.  BIR  has  prioritized  the  institutionalization  of  its  anticorruption \nrevenue  program  (Run  After  Tax  Evaders  or  RATE).  Lessons  from  the  second  DPSP \nsubprogram 8  indicate  that  these  initiatives  must  be  institutionalized  within  the  agencies  to \nensure  they  are  sustainable,  permanent,  and  effective  deterrents  to  tax  evasion.  The \nGovernment  submitted  amendments  to  tax  legislation  (excise  tax  and  consolidation  of \ninvestment  tax  incentives)  to  enhance  tax  policy  efficiency  and  broaden  the  tax  base;  and \nproposed  simplifying  net  income  taxation  for  individuals  in  business.  Once  approved  by \nCongress, these legislative measures are estimated to increase tax collection by P35 billion in \nthe first full year of operation.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6   Calculated as the change in the national government overall budget deficit from 2008 (0.9% of GDP) to 2009 (3.2% \n\nof GDP).   \n\n7   ADB  staff  estimates  of  fiscal  expansion  in  Southeast  Asia:  Cambodia,  1.8%  of  GDP;  Indonesia,  2.4%  of  GDP; \n\nThailand, 5.1% of GDP; and Viet Nam, 3.8% of GDP. \n\n8   ADB.  2008.

Washington, DC.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTERCYCLICAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM \n\n20. \nThe  Government  announced  its  countercyclical  expenditure  program  in  2009  and \nintegrated  it  into  the  2009  budget.  The  national  government  budget  does  not  have  automatic \nstabilizers embedded on the expenditure side of the budget. Therefore it had to announce the \ncountercyclical expenditure program focusing on advancing infrastructure projects already in the \ninvestment  pipeline,  scaling  up  social  assistance  and  public  employment  programs,  and \nintroducing policy measures to expedite budget disbursements. Overall, noninterest expenditure \nis  programmed  to  rise  by  20%  in  2009  over  2008,  providing  a  much-needed  boost  to  the \neconomy. The 2009 national budget substantially increases spending on social sectors to help \nmitigate adverse impacts of the economic contraction on the poor. In real terms (i.e., inflation-\nadjusted),  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development's  budget  for  2009  has  doubled \ncompared  with  the  2008  budget  (primarily  for  funding  the  conditional  cash  transfer  program); \neducation  expenditure  has  increased  by  10%  and  health  spending  by  19%.  Overall,  spending \non  social  sectors  increased  from  27%  of  the  budget  in  2005  to  31%  in  2009.  The  PHI-CS  in \nparticular will support the Government's ongoing and scaled up social assistance programs and \ninfrastructure  programs  in  the  social  sector  and  agriculture  included  in  the  2009  budget  and \nproposed 2010 budget (Table 3 and Development Policy letter in Appendix 1). \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Philippines: Selected Social Assistance and Infrastructure Programs \n\nProgram Description \n\nProgram \nSocial Assistance Programs \n1.

Spending  on  infrastructure  also  increased  and  procurement  advanced. \n21. \nThe  2009  budgets  for  the  key  infrastructure  agencies  were  significantly  increased.  The \nDepartment of Public Works and Highways budget increased by 13% in real terms over 2008, \nand  the  Department  of  Agriculture's  budget  rose  by  52%  in  real  terms.  To  ensure  that  the \nGovernment's countercyclical expenditure program would be timely and effective by the second \nsemester  of  2009,  these  agencies  agreed  to  obligate  (or  commit)  at  least  60%  of  their  total \nspending program for 2009 during the first semester of 2009. The PHI-CS will support the labor-\nintensive and quick disbursing infrastructure programs in the social sectors. These include the \nconstruction  and  repairs  of  school  and  library  hubs  program  and  the  health  facilities \nenhancement  program  in  the  2009  budget  and  proposed  2010  budget.  The  PHI-CS  will  also \nsupport  the  farm  to  market  roads  program  implemented  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and \nthe Department of Public Works and Highways in the 2009 budget and in 2010.  \n \n22. \nSocial  Programs.  The  social  assistance  programs  are  implemented  within  the \nframework of the Government's national social welfare program. In February 2007, the National \nEconomic and Development Authority passed a national definition of social protection and the \ntypes of programs covered by it. As the next step, the Government established an institutional \nframework  for  enhanced  delivery  of  social  protection  programs  that  specifically  assigns \noperating  responsibilities  of  the  National  Social  Welfare  Program  to  the  Department  of  Social \nWelfare  and  Development.  Within  this  context,  agencies  have  designed  or  refined  and \nimplemented  several  social  assistance  programs  to  help  mitigate  the  worst  effects  of  the \neconomic contraction on the poor. \n \n23. \nThe Government has scaled up its social assistance and poverty reduction programs to \nprotect  the  most  vulnerable  from  the  effects  of  the  economic  contraction.  These  programs \ninclude the hunger mitigation program, self-employment assistance kaunlaran (SEA-K) program, \nfood  for  school  program,  family-based  conditional  cash  transfer  (CCT)  program,  and  the  new \ncrisis-related comprehensive livelihood and emergency employment program (CLEEP), and the \ncommunity-based  development  program  (Kalahi).  These  are  a  combination  of  short-term \nprograms  to  mitigate  the  worst  effects  of  the  crisis  on  the  most  vulnerable  people  in  the \ncommunity,  and  longer-term  programs  aimed  at  addressing  causes  of  poverty  such  as  limited \naccess to education and health services for children (Table 3). Presidential Executive Order 782, \nissued in 2009, allocates 1.5% of ministries' maintenance expenditure to new hiring of displaced \nworkers accredited with the Department of Labor and Employment on temporary contracts of up \nto 6 months. This could create an additional 40,000 jobs.  \n \n24.  While  scaling  up  these  programs  is  important  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  sharp \ndownturn  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  families,  some  of  the  programs  are  thought  to  be \nfragmented,  not  well  targeted,  and  have  leakages;  overall  results  in  terms  of  net  welfare  to \nrecipient  groups  are  mixed.  An  ADB  study  on  social  protection  coverage  shows  that  such \nprograms only cover one third of the poor compared with an average of one half in Southeast \nAsia  and  East  Asia.  In  particular,  the  rice  subsidy  program  is  considered  costly  and  not  well \ntargeted.  The  Commission  of  Audit\u2019s  performance  audit  identifies  implementation  weaknesses \nin  some  of  these  programs.9 The  Government  is  looking  at  ways  to  enhance  social  protection \ncoverage  of  the  poor  in  a  well-targeted  framework.  In  this  effort,  the  Government  is \nimplementing its national social welfare framework (para. 22). With the aim of refining targeted \nprograms  under  the  new  definition,  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development  is \nimplementing the CCT program with improved targeting techniques (proxy means test), and the \n\n                                                 \n9   The Commission on Audit is the Philippines' supreme audit institution. The various audit reports are available at the \n\nCommission on Audit website (http://www.coa.gov.ph). \n\n \n\n\fCLEEP,  both  supported  under  the  PHI-CS.  The  CCT  program  provides  income  support  of \nP1,400  per  month  to  recipient  poor  families  with  attached  conditions  related  to  pre-  and \npostnatal  care;  children\u2019s  attendance  at  preschool,  elementary  school,  and  junior  high  school; \nand  child  immunization.  Currently  covering  337,345  families,  the  Government  intends  to \nincrease coverage to up to 699,000 families by the end of 2009. It is intended that the CCT will \neventually cover up to 2 million poor and vulnerable families and therefore act as an automatic \nstabilizer  on  the  expenditure  side  of  the  budget.  The  CLEEP  was  designed  to  respond  to \neconomic  slow  down  and  aims  to  create  373,117  temporary  jobs  in  labor  intensive  programs \nimplemented by line ministries and attached agencies. The Government is now starting to look \nat ways to reform the rice subsidy program and shift savings to more effective social assistance \nprograms. Appendix 6 provides a poverty impact assessment of these programs. \n \nThe National Economic and Development Authority assists in monitoring implementation \n25. \nand  disbursement  of  key  crisis-related  programs,  and  reports  to  the  President  on  a  monthly \nbasis.  During  the  first  semester  of  2009,  238,610  temporary  jobs  were  created  under  the \ncomprehensive livelihood employment and emergency employment program with about 50.0% \nof  the  budget  obligated.  The  Department  of  Education  obligated  102%  of  its  spending \ncommitments  for  the  first  semester  of  2009,  while  the  performance  of  the  other  important \ndepartments is as follows: the Department of Public Works and Highways 100%; Department of \nTransportation and Communication 57%, and Department of Agriculture 55%. \n \n26. \nPublic  Financial  Management.  The  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM) \nsupplemented  ongoing  PFM  reforms  with  additional  measures  to  expedite  disbursements  to \nassist  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  stimulate  the  economy  through  timely,  well-targeted,  and \ntransparent  programs.  Many  of  the  key  procurement  ministries,  such  as  the  Department  of \nAgriculture,  Department  of  Education,  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways,  and \nDepartment of Transportation and Communication, have relatively low absorptive capacity and \nutilization  rates \nthe  economy. \nSupplementary  measures  include  (i)  shifting  from  a  quarterly  cash  release  basis  to  a  6-month \ncash  release  basis  that  improves  budget  certainty  and  predictability  for  line  ministries;  \n(ii)  mandating  government  agencies  to  spend  within  the  month  or  lose  the  money;  and  \n(iii)  clarifying  to  ministries  that  they  can  start  the  procurement  process  prior  to  receiving \nallotments from DBM (authority to obligate the budget) but the signing of contracts will require \nreceipt of these allotments (clarification provided by the Government Procurement Policy Board, \nwhich oversees implementation of the procurement reform law). Prior to this circular, agencies \nwould not begin the procurement process until they received budget allotments\u2014causing delays \nin  the  procurement  process.  These  new  actions  have  improved  the  efficiency  of  budget \ndisbursements. \n \n27. \nUnder  its  PFM  and  procurement  reforms,  the  Government  introduced  measures  and \nsystems to address problems with leakages and corruption with programs. This is a long-term \nreform  effort.  Substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  procurement  reform.  The  Government\u2019s \nProcurement  Policy  Board  continues  to  make  substantial  progress  in  implementing  the \nProcurement  Reform  Law  of  2003  and  its  3-year  action  plan  to  strengthen  the  institutional \nframework, capacity building of procurement officers, and enforcement of the law. This includes \nexpanding the electronic procurement portal (PhilGEPS), which aims to increase transparency \nand  enhance  competition  in  procurement.  The  Procurement  Transparency  Group,  with \ngovernment  agencies  and  major  civil  society  organizations  as  members,  is  tracking  and \n\nthat  could  undermine  Government  efforts \n\nto  stimulate \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n  \n\nmonitoring  procurement  of  selected  infrastructure  projects.10 Regular  updates  of  procurement \nmonitoring  are  posted  on  the  group\u2019s  website.11 If  discrepancies  are  identified  in  the  bid  and \nawards  process,  the  group  notifies  the  bids  and  awards  committee  and  stakeholders  with  the \nobjective of resolving any transparency concerns. \n \n\nV. \n\nECONOMIC AND POVERTY IMPACT OF THE COUNTERCYCLICAL EXPENDITURE \n\nPROGRAM \n\nEconomic  Stimulus  Effects.  The  national  government  budget  deficit  is  projected  at \n28. \n3.2% of GDP or an expansion of 2.4% over 2008 (deficit of 0.9% in 2008). An ADB assessment \nindicates that the stimulus effect of the expansion will be less than 2.4% of GDP as it depends \non the type of spending activities in the stimulus package, and their multiplier effects and timing \n(Appendix 6). For example, tax breaks of P36 billion are likely to expand GDP by less than this \namount  as  some  proportion  will  be  saved,  while  the  social  assistance  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure  spending  program  of  P160  billion  are  likely  to  stimulate  the  economy  by  up  to \nP192 billion (multiplier of 1.2). These programs are likely to have an immediate impact because \nof their short disbursement periods. Some of the larger infrastructure projects, however, will take \nup to 12 months to have an impact due to the longer procurement and disbursements periods. \n \n29. \nPoverty  Impacts.  An  economic  slowdown  or  contraction  of  about  \u22120.5%  to  1.8%  in \n2009 will reduce per capita incomes ranging from \u20130.2% to \u20132.5%. This is expected to increase \npoverty in the short term because of the weak labor market and reduced household earnings. \nOver  the  medium  term,  a  slow  economic  recovery  will  create  persistently  high  unemployment \nand  suppressed  earnings  in  the  informal  sector  as  new  labor  market  entrants  outnumber  the \nnew  jobs  created.  Structural  poverty  may  persist  as  poor  families'  access  to  social  services  is \nreduced.  The  Government's  fiscal  stimulus  will  partially  offset  the  unemployment  and  poverty \nimpacts of the crisis; however, an economic recovery of about 5%\u20136% in 2011 is necessary to \nensure  a  sustained  reduction  in  poverty.  The  CCT  and  employment  programs  (Table  3)  will \nhave an immediate impact on the welfare of families, and are reaching a significant number of \npeople likely to be affected by the crisis (Appendix 6). However, some of these programs (such \nas the subsidized rice program) are not well targeted; this will undermine their effectiveness.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nTHE OBJECTIVE, SCOPE, AND COVERAGE OF THE LOAN \n\n \nA. \n\nObjective \n\nThe  objective  of  the  PHI-CS  loan  is  to  provide  support  for  the  Government's \n30. \ncountercyclical expenditure program for 2009 and therefore ensure predictability of Government \nbudget  financing  given  the  necessity  for  temporary  fiscal  expansion.  This  will  allow  the \nGovernment to protect its social spending and poverty reduction programs and objectives, and \ncontinue with its longer-term development objectives in 2009.    \n \n\n                                                 \n10  The  group  established  under  the  DPSP\u2019s  subprogram  2  comprises  representatives  from  the  Government \nProcurement  Policy  Board,  key  procurement  agencies,  and  six  civil  society  organizations  nominated  by  the  Civil \nSociety Organization Forum\u2014a voluntary gathering of major civil society organizations. The six are the Bishops\u2013\nBusinessmen Conference, Makati Business Club, Transparency and Accountability Network, Ateneo Government \nWatch, Confederation of Filipino Consultants, and Procurement Watch. \n\n11  Procurement Transparency Group. http://procurementtransparencygroup.wordpress.com. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n31. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500,000,000  under  the  Countercyclical \nSupport  Facility  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  5-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nLondon  interbank-offered  rate  (LIBOR)  plus  200  bps;  a  commitment  charge  of  75  bps  on \nundisbursed  loan  balance,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i) the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n\nTable 4: Government Financing Requirements \n(Peso billion, unless otherwise indicated) \n\nActual for 2008 \n\nProgrammed for 2009 \n\n2009 Actual \n(Jan\u2013Apr) \n\nFinancing Mix \nNet Financing \nExternal (net) \n    External (gross) \n    Less amortization \nDomestic (net) \nDomestic (gross) \nLess Amortization \nGross Financing Mix (%) \n   Domestic (%) \n   External (%) \n       Project ($ million) \n       Program ($ million)a \n   Bonds and other \n\ncommercial debt ($ \nmillion) \n\n160.6 \n(9.2) \n71.3 \n80.5 \n169.8 \n429.8 \n260.0 \n100.0 \n86.0 \n14.0 \n545.0 \n584.0 \n\n270.6 \n108.4 \n209.1 \n100.7 \n161.8 \n451.8 \n290.0 \n100.0 \n68.0 \n32.0 \n411.0 \n1,650.0 \n\n29.5 \n34.9 \n95.7 \n60.8 \n(5.4) \n255.6 \n261.0 \n100.0 \n88.0 \n12.0 \n63.0 \n448.0 \n\n500.0 \n\n2,250.0 \n\n1,500.0 \n\na   Proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  program  loans  for  2009  include  the  third  subprogram  of  the \nDevelopment Policy Support Program (DPSP) ($250 million), the second tranche of Governance in Justice \nSector  Development  Program  ($150  million),  and  the  second  subprogram  of  the  Local  Government \nFinancing  and  Budget  Reform  Program  ($225  million).  On  a  disbursement  basis,  the  first  tranche  of  the \nGovernance  in  Justice  Sector  Development  Program  ($150  million)  was  disbursed  in  the  first  quarter  of \n2009  and  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  in  December  2008.

According to Department of Finance (DOF) budget reports, the \ngross  budget  financing  requirements  for  2009  are  estimated  at  P660.9  billion,  of  which  gross \nexternal  financing  requirements  are  P209.1  billion  (about  $4.3  billion).  Overall,  net  financing \nrequirements (net of amortization) amount to P270.6 billion. The Government\u2019s debt strategy for \n2009 is to raise 68% of gross financing requirements from domestic markets and the remaining \n32%  from  international  markets.  However,  the  gross  financing  requirements  and  the \ncomposition of financing sources remains fluid as international credit markets stabilize and the \nimpact on the fiscal situation unfolds. The PHI-CS loan will help close the financing gap for 2009 \nthrough support to ongoing and scaled up social assistance programs and infrastructure in the \nsocial  sectors  (Table  3).  ADB  program  loans  amounting  to  a  combined  $775.0  million,  other \ndevelopment partner programs, and commercial borrowings will help close the financing gap.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n  \n\nVII. \n\nIMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\nCountercyclical Support Management \n\n \nA. \n \nDOF,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  report  to  ADB,  administer  and  disburse  the  loan \n33. \nproceeds,  and  maintain  accounts.  The  coordinating  committee  initiated  under  the  DPSP,  and \nchaired by the DOF undersecretary, will be responsible for coordinating implementation of the \nGovernment's  countercyclical  expenditure  program  together  with  DBM  and  the  National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority.  The  committee  will  meet  semi-annually  to  monitor \nprogress  and  oversee  the  Government's  countercyclical  expenditure  program  implementation. \nADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer.  \n \nB. \n \n34. \nThe loan will be released in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The loan proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  no  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness  date  of  the  loan.  Items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  8)  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as \nthe Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if during each year that loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Philippines total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance \nwith  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans,  all \ngoods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member  countries  will  be  procured,  with \ndue  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard \npublic  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods \ncommonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  market  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \nC. \n \n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  PHI-CS.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  PHI-CS.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  PHI-CS  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the PHI-CS. \n \n36. \nThe country\u2019s financial management systems were assessed based on diagnostic work \ndone  in  the  last  12  months  including  the  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment led by the World Bank, with ADB participation during the first stage. Based on this \nassessment, the fiduciary arrangements proposed for the PHI-CS loan remain acceptable.

The  Government  places  significant  emphasis  on  making  progress  in \nimplementing  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  in  line  ministries  and  the  operating \nperformance \nthe \ncredibility  of  the  budget,  its  execution,  and  reporting;  rolling  out  internal  control  systems  and \ninternal  audit;  and  institutionalizing  anticorruption  initiatives  in  key  revenue-raising  agencies  of \nBIR and BOC. These measures are being undertaken within the DPSP program cluster and with \ntechnical support from ADB and other development partners (Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment,  JBIC,  European  Commission,  United  States  Agency \nInternational \nDevelopment, and the World Bank). \n \nD. \n \n37. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen  a  deposit  account  at  BSP  to  receive  all  loan  proceeds.

This  is  manifested  in  a  number  of  ways:  collapse  in  exports,  stagnating \ninflow of remittances, and decreased tourist arrivals, all leading to recessionary conditions by the \nfirst  quarter  of  2009.  Job  vacancies  have  declined  and  unemployment  increased.  ADB  staff \nestimate  poverty  could  rise  by  1.4  million  people  in  the  absence  of  the  countercyclical \nexpenditure program. \nFirst  quarter GDP  growth  on  a  year-on-year  basis was  0.4%.  The  seasonally  adjusted  quarter-\non-quarter  growth  rate  was  \u20132.3%.  The  index  of  leading  economic  indicators  entered  negative \nterritory  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  and  deteriorated  in  the  second  quarter  suggesting \nrecessionary conditions.  \nExports fell by 40% (year-on-year) from December 2008 to April 2009.   \nRemittances  slowed  to  2.5%  growth  in  the  first  4  months  of  2009  (year-on-year)  compared  to \n15% growth in 2008. In per capita growth terms, remittances stagnated. Remittances have been \na major driver of poverty reduction and in the past allowed 4 million Filipinos to escape poverty. \nThe  stagnant  growth  in  per  capita  terms  indicates  potentially  adverse  impacts  on  welfare  of \nfamilies.    \nThe economic contraction in the first quarter contributed to a decline in tax collection in the first \nsemester of 2009. Taxes fell by 5.2% over the same period in 2008.   \n\nDeclined by 5.2% in the first semester of 2009. \n\nSpreads surged by 800 bps in October 2008 from an average of 220 bps prevailing prior to the \nglobal  financial  crisis.  Spreads  gradually  declined  in  the  last  3  months,  and  are  currently  at \n320 bps.  \nThe Government's response to mitigating the risk of the global financial crisis on the Philippine \nfinancial  sector  and  macroeconomy  has  been  appropriate  and  responsive.  It  involves  taking \npreemptive  measures  aimed  at  increasing  liquidity  in  the  domestic  banking  system,  assuring \nconfidence of depositors, and strengthening the central bank's lender of last resort facility.  \nThe  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (BSP)  has  operated  a  prudent  and  responsive  monetary \npolicy  stance  throughout  the  crisis.  Earlier  in  2008  it  tightened  monetary  policy  to  counter  the \nthreat of second-round inflationary pressures from the surge in global commodity prices. Later in \n2008, it switched to an expansionary stance to ensure sufficient liquidity in the banking system \nagainst a backdrop of rapidly falling inflation. Headline inflation decreased to 0.2% by the end of \nJuly,  undershooting  BSP's  inflation  target  of  2.5%\u20134.5%  for  2009.  Core  inflation  fell  to  3.3%  in \nJuly on a year-on-year basis. The rapid fall in inflation signals a significant negative output gap.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

Current  national  government  public  debt  is  56%  and  is \nprojected to rise to 57% in 2009. Nonfinancial public debt is at 59.9% and is expected to rise in \nline with national government public debt. Public debt is vulnerable to exchange rate depreciation \nas 40% of public debt is external. \nThe  Philippines  has  a  public  financial  management  reform  agenda.  Key  reforms  include \nintroducing  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  and  performance-based  management \nframework,  and  piloting  internal  control  systems,  among  others  supported  under  ADB  TA,  the \nDPSP subprogram 3, and other development partner assistance. \nThe external balance is very strong. Gross international reserves are at $39.5 billion, equivalent \nto 6.3 months import cover and 3 times higher than external debt maturing in 2009. \nThe  Government's  countercyclical  expenditure  program  focuses  on  advancing  infrastructure \nprojects already in the investment pipeline, scaling up social assistance and public employment \nprograms,  and  introducing  policy  measures  to  expedite  budget  disbursements.  Overall, \nnoninterest  expenditure  is  programmed  to  rise  by  20%  in  2009  over  2008,  providing  a  much-\nneeded boost to the economy. \nThe 2009 budgets for key infrastructure agencies were significantly increased. The Department \nof  Public  Works  and  Highways  budget  increased  by  13%  in  real  terms  over  2008,  and  the \nDepartment  of  Agriculture's  budget  rose  by  52%  in  real  terms.  To  ensure  the  Government's \ncountercyclical  program  would  be  timely  and  effective  by  the  second  semester  of  2009,  these \nagencies agreed to obligate at least 60% of their total spending program for 2009 during the first \nsemester of 2009. \nThe Government has scaled up its flagship social assistance and poverty reduction programs to \nprotect  the  most  vulnerable  from  the  effects  of  the  economic  contraction.  These  programs \ninclude the hunger mitigation program, self-employment assistance kaunlaran (SEA-K) program, \nfood for school program, family-based conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, comprehensive \nlivelihood  and  emergency  employment  program \nthe  community-based \ndevelopment program (KALAHI).  \n\n(CLEEP)  and \n\nDebt sustainability \nanalysis \n\nPublic financial \nmanagement \nsystems \n\nExternal balance \n\nIncreased \ninfrastructure \nspending \n\nSocial assistance \nprograms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

The IMF updated its DSA for the purposes of the \nPHI-CS.  This  appendix  summarizes  the  pertinent  findings  of  the  DSA  as  well  as  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assessment of the countercyclical expenditure program support loan \nusing the IMF DSA as input.  \n \n2. \nThe  Philippines'  public  sector  debt  is  broadly  sustainable,  but  short-term  risks  have \nincreased due to global financial instability. Public debt as a share of GDP has declined to ratios \nlast  seen  in  the  early  1990s,  but  remains  high  by  regional  standards.  At  the  end  of  2008, \nnational government public debt amounted to 56% of GDP, down from its peak of 83% in 2003 \n(Figure A3). Nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt declined to 59.9% from 101.0% during the \nsame  period  (Figure  A3).  A  prudent  borrowing  strategy,  including  lengthening  the  average \nmaturity  of  debt  to  7.1  years  and  moving  to  domestic  financing;2 fiscal  discipline  (operating \nprimary  budget  surpluses);  and  sustained  economic  growth  contributed  to  the  rapid  decline. \nDebt  servicing  costs  as  a  share  of  national  government  budget  revenues  also  declined  from \n36.7% in 2005 to 22.6% in 2007, thereby freeing up substantial resources for priority spending \nsince 2007. However, at 8% of GDP, the Philippines\u2019 public debt servicing costs (amortization \nand  interest  payments)  are  high  by  regional  standards.  The  debt  amortization  profile  is  lumpy \nwith $8.4 billion in external public debt maturing in 2009 and 2010, increasing pressure on the \nGovernment\u2019s gross financing needs (Figure A3).  \n \n3. \nThe  updated  IMF  DSA  indicates  that  public  sector  debt  is  broadly  sustainable.  In  the \nbaseline  scenario,  no  new  fiscal  measures  are  introduced  over  the  medium  term  apart  from \nplanned  reduction  of  the  corporate  income  tax  rate  in  2009.  In  this  scenario,  the  nonfinancial \nsector  public  debt  initially  rises  to  about  65%  in  2009/2010  and  then  declines  back  to  60%  of \nGDP  in  2014.  While  debt  dynamics  are  favorable  overall,  they  remain  vulnerable  to  shocks, \nespecially exchange rate fluctuations, as 40% of public debt is external. For example, the IMF \nsimulated a one-time permanent real depreciation of 30%, which led to a 20 percentage point \nincrease in the external debt ratio from 2009, which would remain close to 80% in the medium \nterm. The assessment also notes rising resilience to interest rate and growth shocks. Given the \nlengthening  of  maturities  and  increasing  utilization  of  domestic  financing,  external  debt  is  less \naffected  by world  interest  rates  and  domestic  growth  shocks.  It  is  only moderately  affected  by \nnoninterest shocks to the current account. The DSA also simulates the impact of lower primary \nbudget surpluses on debt over the medium term. It assumes a reduction in the average surplus \nfrom  2.7%  of  GDP  to  1.3%.  Under  this  scenario,  the  NFPS  debt  would  be  64%  in  2014.  The \nvarious scenarios are summarized in Table A3, with the baseline NFPS debt at 60% of GDP by \n2014. \n \n4. \nImplications  of  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  Loan. The loan of $500 million \nhas  a  term  of  5  years  with  a  3-year  grace  period.  Two  principal  repayments,  each  of  \n$250 million, will be made in the fourth and fifth year, i.e., 2013 and 2014.

ADB  operations  were  designed  to  address  these  constraints  under  three \ncorresponding  pillars  in  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  approach  to  development.  The \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP),  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  on  8 \nFebruary  2007,  operationalizes \nthat \ncomplements  and  reinforces  ADB\u2019s  sector  program  loans  and  projects.  The  DPSP,  structured \nas a program cluster, aims to help the Government achieve its medium- to long-term goals of \nsustained  high  economic  growth  of  6%\u20137%  per  annum,  lower  unemployment,  and  poverty \nreduction. \n \n2. \n \n\nTo achieve these objectives, the DPSP undertakes the following strategic reforms: \n\nthe  strategy  by  providing  an  umbrella  operation \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nto  budget  execution,  accounting, \n\nImprove  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and  improve \ncreditworthiness by enhancing the quality of fiscal management by (a) increasing \ntax  revenues  annually  through  tax  policy  reforms;  (b)  strengthening  tax \nadministration  and  enforcement,  and  reducing  revenue  leakages  through \nimproved governance; (c) reducing inefficient spending to permit increased social \nand  poverty-related  spending;  and  (d)  strengthening  the  debt  management \nstrategy  to  manage  government  contingent  liabilities  and  risks  prudently. \nSubprogram 3 of the DPSP aims to maintain macroeconomic stability under the \ncurrent  adverse  global \nreassuring  depositors' \nfinancial  environment  by \nconfidence in the domestic banking system. \nEnhance  governance  in  PFM  by  (a)  improving  PFM  from  budget  preparation \nreporting; \nthrough \n(b) strengthening  performance  management  and \nimproving  public  service \ndelivery;  (c)  reforming  procurement;  and  (d)  implementing  anticorruption  and \nenforcement  strategies  for  revenue-collecting  agencies  and  key  procurement \nagencies.  Subprogram  3  sustains  critical  public  expenditures  while  maintaining \nbudget discipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the deceleration of growth. \nImprove the investment climate and promote rural development by (a) clarifying \nand strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for investments and trade, \nthrough  greater  public\u2013private \n(b) \nparticipation  and  greater  coordination  of  public  infrastructure  investments,  and \n(c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity. \nEnhance  human  capital  and  social  inclusion  by  improving  the  policy  framework \nfor social protection, sustaining real spending on health and education, improving \ntargeting  of  programs,  piloting  the  conditional  cash  transfer  program  tied  to \nperformance outcomes in child education and health, refining public employment \nprograms,  and  establishing  a  national  poverty  monitoring  and  response  system \nto help mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown on poverty. \n\ninfrastructure  development \n\nrecording,  and \n\nfacilitating \n\n \n3. \nKey features of the DPSP include (i) three single-tranche operations from 2006 to 2009, \nwith  a  well-defined,  medium-term  framework  specified  at  the  outset  and  including  completed \nhigh-impact  reforms  prior  to  consideration  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors;  (ii)  triggers  for \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

In this way, the DPSP provides a \ncoherent medium-term reform strategy with three discrete but linked subprograms and a strong \nemphasis on performance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram is \ncontingent  on  overall  satisfactory  performance  of  the  triggers.  It  recognizes  the  necessity  for \nflexibility  in  the  reform  measures,  with  provisions  for  incorporating  lessons  and  responding  to \nchanges in the external environment in the design of downstream subprograms.  \n \n4. \n \n\nThe DPSP has the following four phases: \n\nSubprogram  1.  Financed  by  ADB  ($250  million)  in  2007,  it  supported  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  program  creating  the  basis  for  continuous \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2007\u20132009. \nSubprogram  2.  Financed by ADB ($250 million) with parallel financing from the \nGovernment  of  Japan  ($100  million),  it  supported  the  Government's  fiscal \nsustainability  program  and  efforts  to  strengthen  governance  in  PFM  and \nprocurement. \nSubprogram  3.  The  present  phase,  to  be  financed  by  ADB  ($250  million)  with \nparallel  financing  from  the  Government  of  Japan,  increases  the  focus  on \ninstitutionalizing  governance  programs  such  as  the  anticorruption  revenue \nprograms  in  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  and  Bureau  of  Customs,  the \ninvestment climate, and the social sectors.  \nPostprogram  monitoring.  In  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  an \ninnovation  added  at  the  subprogram  3  phase  is  a  postprogram  monitoring \nframework  (Table  A4).  The  Government  of  the  Philippines,  ADB,  and  the \nGovernment of Japan have agreed to a post-DPSP framework for 12 months to \ncreate  the  basis  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  and  engagement  during  the \ncritical period of 2009/10 prior to the formulation of a new government after the \nPhilippine presidential elections in May 2010. The monitoring framework focuses \non the Government's short-term plan advancing its reforms in fiscal policy, PFM, \nand  selected  areas  in  investment  climate  and  poverty,  supported  by  ADB,  the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  and  other  development  partners'  technical  and  program \nassistance.   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n    Appendix 4 \n\nFiscal Policy and \nMacroeconomic Stability \n1.

It then contracted by 2.3% in the first quarter of \n2009  on  a  quarter-on-quarter  basis  (seasonally  adjusted).  The  contraction  was  broad-based \nwith  most  major  components  of  aggregate  demand  (exports,  consumption,  and  investment) \ndeclining. Reflecting suppressed aggregate demand in the economy, inflation has fallen sharply \nfrom  its  peak  of  12%  in  September  2008  to  0.2%  in  July  2009  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  The \ncollapse in exports and stalling household consumption (partly due to stalling remittances) were \nthe primary factors behind the economic contraction in the first quarter.   \n\n      (a) Potential and Actual Economic Growth 1970\u20132009 \n                                                                                                          (monthly rates, year-on-year) \n\n(b) Headline and Core Inflation Jan 2008 to July 2009 \n\nFigure A6: Output Gap and Inflation \n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n9\n\n7\n\n0\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\n5\n\n8\n\n1\n\n4\n\n7\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\na\n\ne\n\nn\n\nb\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\n-\n0\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\np\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nu\n\nu\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nl\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\na\n\ny\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nu\n\ne\n\nc\n\no\n\ne\n\ng\n\np\n\n-\n0\n\n-\n0\n\nt\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nv\n\nc\n\n-\n0\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\na\n\ne\n\nn\n\nb\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\n-\n0\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\n9\n\np\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nu\n\nu\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nl\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\na\n\ny\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nGDP growth\n\nPotential growth\n\nCore Inflation\n\nHeadline Inflation\n\n \n \nNotes: The Philippines\u2019 potential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates \na  nonlinear  trend  in  the  economic  growth  data.

Projected growth figures for 2009.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Central Bank of Philippines, National Economic Development Authority, National \nStatistical Coordination Board estimates. \n\n \n2. \nAnother way of looking at economic performance is the output gap, which measures the \ndifference  between  potential  output  and  actual  output  measured  in  terms  of  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth.  A  small  output  gap  would  suggest  that  the  economy  is  at  its  long-run \ntrend or full employment. If growth exceeds the potential growth rate (i.e., a positive output gap) \nthen  it  would  suggest  the  economy  risks  overheating  associated  with  above-trend  inflation.  If \nactual  growth  is  below  potential  (i.e.,  a  negative  output  gap)  then  this  suggests  an  economic \ndownturn  usually  associated  with  below  trend  inflation.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nestimates  indicate  potential  economic  growth  in  the  range  of  5%\u20136%.  Figure  A6  shows  the \nemergence of a significant output gap in 2009, projected at 4%\u20135%, similar in magnitude to the \none that emerged in 2008. Inflation is subdued, indicative of suppressed aggregate demand.  \n \n3. \nThe  suppressed  aggregate  demand  extends  to  affecting  the  labor  market  through \nreduced  hiring  and  increased  unemployment.

Unemployment  increased  from  7.3%  in  2008  to \n7.6%  in  2009.  ADB  staff  estimate  that  the  projected  economic  slowdown  could  increase  the \nincidence of poverty by 1.4 million people based, on the assumption that the economy contracts \nby 0.5% in 2009 and the poverty economic growth relation is 0.16%.  \n \nB.  \n \n4. \nEconomic  Stimulus  Effects.  In  times  of  a  negative  output  gap,  governments  may \nstimulate  the  economy  through  a  combination  of  policy  instruments  such  as  (i)  expansionary \nmonetary policy and therefore lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and consumption, \nand  (ii)  fiscal  expansion  through  tax  cuts  and  increasing  discretionary  public  spending.  An \nappropriate fiscal expansion will depend on its size relative to the output gap and the multiplier \n(or second-round effects) of the different components of the fiscal stimulus. Empirical evidence \nfor  other  countries  indicates  that  infrastructure  spending  has  the  largest  multiplier  effects, \nfollowed  by  cash  transfers  to  poor  families;  tax  breaks  have  the  lowest  multiplier  effects  as \nsome proportion will be saved. \n \n5. \nThe Government is using both instruments to stimulate the economy. In aggregate, the \nnational government budget deficit is projected at 3.2% of GDP or an expansion of 2.4% over \n2008  (budget  deficit  of 0.9%  in  2008).  This  expansion  is  equivalent  to  about  40%\u201350%  of  the \nnegative  output  gap.  The  stimulus  effect  of  the  expansion  will  be  less  than  2.4%  of  GDP  and \ndepends on the stimulus components and their multiplier effects and timing: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  tax  breaks  of  P36  billion  are  likely  to  expand  GDP  by  less  than  this \namount as some proportion will be saved (multiplier less than 1.0). \nThe social assistance and labor-intensive infrastructure spending program of \nP160 billion are likely to stimulate the economy in the range of P160 billion\u2013\nP192  billion  with  a  multiplier  of  1.2  times  of  the  initial  disbursement.  These \ntheir  short \nprograms  are \ndisbursement  periods.  Some  of  the  larger  projects,  however,  will  take  up  to \n12  months  to  have  an  impact  due  to  longer  procurement  and  disbursement \nperiods. \n-controlled \nThe \ncorporations amounting to P100 billion  could also stimulate the economy by \nup  to  P120  billion.  Some  of  the  projects  of  the  larger  corporations  will  also \ntake longer to have an impact.  \n\ninfrastructure  programs  of  government-owned  and \n\nto  have  an \n\nimpact  due \n\nimmediate \n\nlikely \n\n \n6. \nPoverty Impacts. The social assistance programs aim to mitigate the adverse effects of \nthe  economy  contraction  on  the  poor  and  most  vulnerable  to  the  crisis.  The  conditional  cash \ntransfer program covers 337,345 families, this is expected to be increased to 699,000 families in \n2009.  The  public  employment  programs  currently  cover  more  than  137,000  workers  and  are \nexpected  to  cover  373,000  once  fully  rolled  out  this  year.  The  subsidized  rice  program  has \nreached about 1.8 million families. Overall, these programs are reaching a significant proportion \nof those likely to be affected by the crisis (Table A6). However, some of these programs (such \nas  the  subsidized  rice  program)  are  not  well  targeted;  this  will  undermine  its  effectiveness  in \nthese areas.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A6: Poverty Impact Assessment \n \nThe global economic crisis is likely to hurt the poor in the short and medium term through three channels. The first is the weak labor market as hiring activity across \nmost  sectors  has  slowed  and  job  destruction  in  the  modern  export  sector increased  unemployment  in  2009.  The  second  is  through  lower  household  incomes  and \ntherefore lower consumer spending, affecting earnings of workers in the informal sector. The third is through reduced access of poor families to social services such as \neducation and health, which in turn may increase poverty incidence in the medium term. The Asian Development Bank estimates that poverty could rise by 1.4 million \npeople.  The  Government's  countercyclical  public  expenditure  program  is  designed  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  the  crisis  on  the  poor  by  increasing  spending  in  social \nsectors, scaling up key social assistance programs, and accelerating spending on labor-intensive infrastructure programs. \n \nChannel of Effect \nGeneral \nLabor \nmarket  \n\nMitigation or Enhancement Measures \n\nEffects on the Poor \n\nMedium Run \n\n3\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\nIndirect Short Term \nJob losses in the export \nsector and the slowdown in \ninflows of remittances has \nled to second-round effects \nof reduced consumer \nspending and therefore \nlower earnings of workers \nin the informal sector. \n\nA slow economic \nrecovery may create \npersistent \nunemployment as new \nlabor market entrants \noutnumber the jobs \ncreated. \n\nSpecific \nFormal \nand \ninformal \nsector \n\nDirect Short Term \nThe collapse in exports has \nled to job losses in the \nexport-oriented modern \nsector. The decrease in \ntourist arrivals since late \n2008 has reduced hiring \nactivity in the tourism sector. \n \nHiring activity across other \nsectors has also reduced. \n \nOverall, unemployment has \nincreased; the unemployment \nrate is expected to climb over \nthe next 12 months.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\nJob losses and lower \nearnings reduce household \nincomes. ADB estimates that \nif the economy contracts by \n0.5% in 2009, per capita \nincomes will decline by 2.5% \nand therefore 1.4 million \npeople will fall into poverty.  \n\nHousehold \nincome \n\n \n\n \n\nThe fiscal stimulus is expected to partially mitigate the \neconomic contraction and job losses as follows: \n(i)   The P160 billion stimulus package (increase spending \non social assistance programs and labor-intensive \ninfrastructure) is likely to stimulate the economy by up \nto P192 billion through multiplier effects. Some of the \ninfrastructure programs will only impact the economy \nin 2010 after completing the procurement process. \n(ii)   The infrastructure programs of government-owned and \n-controlled corporations amounting to P100 billion \ncould stimulate the economy by up to P120 billion. \nSome projects of the larger corporations will take \nlonger to have an impact for the reasons in item (i). \n\n(iii)  The Government's comprehensive livelihood \n\nemployment and emergency employment program is \ntargeting 373,000 jobs in 2009. \n\n(v)   The self-employment assistance Kaunlaran program \nwas expanded from 14,000 households to 36,000 \nhouseholds in 2009 to absorb redundant workers. \n\nGovernment social assistance programs aim to \nsupplement the incomes of poor households. The CCT \nprogram is expected to be expanded to cover 699,000 \nhouseholds by the end of 2009 from 337,345 families in \n2008. \n\nThe subsidized rice program provides assistance to poor \nhouseholds. The food hunger program will also assist in \nthis regard. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nEffects on the Poor \n\nIndirect Short Term \n\nMedium Run \n\nMitigation or Enhancement Measures \n\nChannel of Effect \nGeneral \nAccess to \nsocial \nservices \n\nSpecific \nDirect Short Term \nEducation  Primary and high school \n\n \n\n \n\ndropout rates are expected to \nrise, and school attendance \nsurvival rates are expected to \nfall among poor families with \nrestricted access to \neducation. \nCoverage of child \nimmunization is expected to \nbe reduced and access of \npoor women to pre- and \npostnatal care diminished \ndue to lower household \nincome.  \n\n \n\nHealth \n\n \n\nPoverty rates remain \nhigh among families \nwith higher incidence of \nschool dropout rates.  \n\nThe CCT program will assist recipient families as cash \ntransfers are conditional on children attending school. \n\n \n\nThe Department of Education budget for 2009 was \nincreased by about 13% in real terms, this will assist in \nimproving poor children's access to education over the \nmedium term.  \n\nThe CCT program will assist recipient families as the cash \ntransfers are conditional on obtaining certain child \nimmunizations, and also pregnant women\u2019s access to \nhealth care. \n\nThe Government's medium-term strategy \"Formula One for \nHealth\" aims to improve the quality, efficiency, \neffectiveness, and equity of the health system, particularly \nfor the poor. \n\nNet Impact  \nChannels of effect. An economic slowdown or contraction in the order of \u20130.5% to 1.8% in 2009 will reduce per capita incomes ranging from \u20130.7% to \u20133.0%. This is \nexpected to increase poverty in the short term through a weak labor market and reduced household earnings. Over the medium term, a slow economic recovery will \ncreate persistently high unemployment and suppressed earnings in the informal sector as new labor market entrants outnumber new jobs created. This in turn will lead \nto persistently higher poverty. Structural poverty may persist as poor families' access to social services is reduced. A rebound in remittances from overseas Filipino \nworkers in 2010 would help mitigate the medium-term adverse effects. The Government's fiscal stimulus will partially offset the unemployment and poverty impacts of \nthe crisis; however, an economic recovery of about 5%\u20136% in 2011 is necessary to ensure a sustained reversal of the adverse effects of the economic slowdown on \npoverty. \n \nTime dimensions. The increased spending for social assistance programs will have an immediate positive impact on the poor. The labor-intensive public employment \nprograms will have an immediate positive impact on the labor market and incomes of the poor. The larger infrastructure projects will impact the economy and create \njobs once the procurement process is completed and investments made, most likely in the second semester of 2009 and in 2010.  \nCrucial Assumptions \nThe multiplier effects of public spending range from 1.0 to 1.2 of the initial disbursement and tax multipliers from 0.8 to 1.0. The Government advances procurement \nand is able to make substantial progress to front loading public spending to 60% of the annual budget of the major procurement agencies (the Department of Public \nWorks and Highways,  Department of Education, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Transportation and Communication) in the first semester of 2009.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CCT = conditional cash transfer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n6\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3\n5\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Countercyclical Support Loan for the Philippines \n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\nCountercyclical Support \nFacility \n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nFinancial Sector, Public Management, and Trade Division \n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.    Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines. The Countercyclical Support (PHI-CS) loan \nprovides financing support to the Government's countercyclical public expenditure program aimed at stimulating the economy, \nprotecting spending in the social sectors, and scaling up flagship social assistance programs to protect vulnerable groups in \nthe community from adverse impacts of the global financial crisis. The national government budget does not have automatic \nstabilizers  embedded  on  the  expenditure  side  of  the  budget.  Therefore  it  had  to  introduce  a  countercyclical  expenditure \nprogram  focusing  on  advancing  infrastructure  projects  already  in  the  investment  pipeline,  scaling  up  social  assistance  and \npublic  employment  programs,  and  introducing  policy  measures  to  expedite  budget  disbursements.  Overall,  noninterest \nexpenditure  is  programmed  to  rise  by  20%  in  2009  over  2008  providing  a  much-needed  boost  to  the  economy.  The  2009 \nnational budget substantially increases spending on the social sectors. The Department of Social Welfare and Development's \nbudget has doubled in real terms (i.e., inflation-adjusted) compared with its 2008 budget (primarily for funding the conditional \ncash transfer program); education expenditure has increased by 10% in real terms; and health spending by 19% in real terms. \nOverall, spending on the social sectors has increased from 27% of the budget in 2005 to 31% in 2009.  \n \nThe  PHI-CS  loan  supplements  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  program  loans  to  the  Philippines  and  in  particular  the \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP)  cluster.  The  DPSP  policy  areas  largely  correspond  with  those  of  the \nGovernment as spelled out in the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010, which focuses on five core areas: \n(i)  economic  growth  and  job  creation,  (ii)  energy  dependency  and  power  reforms,  (iii)  social  justice  and  basic  needs,  (iv) \neducation and youth opportunities, and (v) anticorruption measures and governance. The plan\u2018s mission is to \u201cfight poverty by \nbuilding prosperity for the greatest number of Filipino people.\u201d  \n \nThe  Government  has  made  substantial  progress  in  addressing  fiscal  consolidation  and  in  2008  shifted  focus  to  ensuring \nsustainable fiscal policy by enhancing tax revenues over the longer term. This is necessary to increase social expenditures. \nHowever, the global financial crisis and second-round effect of devastated external demand has hurt the Philippine economy. \nFiscal  pressures  come  from  two  sources:  (i)  increased  public  demand  for  additional  social  spending  to  mitigate  poverty \nimpacts, and (ii) a decline in budget revenues in the first quarter of 2009. The challenge faced by the Government is to protect \nrecent  gains  in  social  expenditures,  plus  provide  additional  assistance  through  its  social  programs  such  as  the  conditional \ncash  transfer  program;  provide  a  fiscal  stimulus  through  increased  infrastructure  spending;  and  ensure  medium-term  debt \nsustainability. Consequently, the national government budget deficit will rise to 3.2% of gross domestic product this year and \n2% in 2010. This protects critical public spending and ensures fiscal discipline.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues. The apparent recessionary conditions in the Philippine economy threaten to reverse recent gains in reducing \nunemployment, which steadily declined during the last 2 years. Most recently, unemployment increased from 7.3% to 7.6%. \nEconomic  growth  in  2009  is  estimated  at  -0.5%\u20131.8%,  this  translates  to  a  decline  in  per  capita  income  of  \u20132.5%  to  \u20130.2%. \nThis would result in an increase in the incidence of poverty. A decrease in remittances would add to poverty. Mitigating the \npoverty impacts, the Government piloted the CCT program with 337,345 families in 2008 and 2009, and is expected broaden \nthe program to 699,000 families in 2009. The experience of Indonesia with its unconditional cash transfer has been positive in \nterms of keeping vulnerable families out of poverty during hard times such as now. \n \n2.  Design  Features.  The  PHI-CS  loan  will  provide  budget  support  for  the  Government's  countercyclical  public  expenditure \nprogram  in  infrastructure  and  the  social  sectors.  It  aims  to  ensure  predictability  in  budget  financing  for  2009  as  a  larger \nnational government budget deficit is required than initially projected.  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Lending  \nThe PHI-CS loan supports the Government's countercyclical public expenditure program for 2009. The program includes the \nhunger  mitigation  program,  self-employment  assistance  kaunlaran  (SEA-K)  program,  food  for  school  program,  family-based \nCCT  program,  and  comprehensive  livelihood  and  emergency  employment  program  (CLEEP).  These  programs  are  a \ncombination of short-term programs to mitigate the worst effects of the crisis on the most vulnerable people in the community \nand longer-term programs aimed at addressing causes of poverty such as limited access to education and health services for \nchildren. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n                   Appendix 7 \n\n37\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nADB assessments suggest that the possible decline in per capita income this year and increase in unemployment and poverty \nare  cyclically  aligned  to  the  economic  downturn  and  in  this  regard  will  be  short  term\u2014around  1\u20133  years\u2014assuming  the \neconomy begins recovery next year. If the global economy is slow to recover, or the recovery itself is weak then the poverty \nand unemployment effects will be longer. Key will be the magnitude of the recovery and growth of remittances from overseas \nFilipino workers. As of the first quarter of 2009, remittances remain flat and are expected to decline by 4%\u20136% over the next 3 \nquarters. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nFor the PHI-CS loan in parallel with the DPSP process, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, \nincluding private sector, civil society groups, and development partners. The key forum is the Philippines Development Forum, \nwhich meets twice a year, although working groups meet more often. The mission attended various working group meetings. \nUnder the technical assistance for competitiveness (attached to DPSP subprogram 1), in February 2009 the mission engaged \na  research  institute  to  carry  out  a  survey  of  500  households  and  1,300  individuals  to  solicit  information  on  income, \nexpenditure, and employment experience. A second survey of the same households and an additional 500 individuals will be \ncarried out in July 2009 for the same purpose as well as solicit information about the impact of the crisis on household welfare \nand specific social sector issues related to health and education. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1. Key Issues. The CCT program will benefit women as cash transfers under the program include conditions on meeting \ntargets for pre- and postnatal care. These targets and indicators are covered under the DPSP.  \n2.  Key  Actions.
