I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior secured loan to Eucalypt Mortgages Sdn. Bhd. (EMSB) to finance its acquisition of a \nportfolio of nonperforming mortgage loans (Portfolio) from HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad (HSBC \nor the Seller), in the amount of up to $10 million (the Project). \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Overview of the Asian Nonperforming Loans Market \n2.  Activity in Asia\u2019s nonperforming loans (NPLs) market has gradually picked up since \nAsia\u2019s  economic  crisis  crippled  its  financial  sector  in  the  late  1990s.  The  Asian  region's \ngovernments and banks have succeeded in removing more than $1 trillion of NPLs from bank \nbalance sheets. That has been accomplished through various resolution measures including \nloan  collection,  restructuring,  and  reclassification;  sale  of  NPLs  to  international  investors; \npermanent  write-offs;  good  bank/bad  bank  disposition  strategies;  and  use  of  local  asset \nmanagement companies. While Asia\u2019s banks have approximately $746 billion remaining on their \nbalance sheets, the region has made significant progress in financial system reform and NPL \ndisposition.  Financial  system  reform  is  advancing  to  prevent  recurring  NPL  problems,  and \nregulators  have  been  pushing  banks  to  develop  new  plans,  processes,  and  systems  to \nimplement internal rating-based models.  \n \n3.  However, while banks in the region are advancing measures to prevent new flows of \nNPLs, the existing NPL stock still needs attention.  A vibrant secondary NPL market is needed, \nas well as viable and market- tested resolution strategies, so that existing NPLs can be resolved.  \nIn the case of new NPLs, banks and other market participants would also benefit from a fully \nfunctioning NPL market.  In addition, in the growing Asian economies, bank management\u2019s full \nattention  on  best  practice  in  lending  and  its  continuous  improvement  are  needed.    NPLs \n(including existing NPL stock) would detract from this crucial exercise. Appendixes 1 and 2 give \na detailed discussion of the benefits of NPL resolution and financial and corporate restructuring.  \n \nB.  Nonperforming Loans in Malaysia \n1.  The Danaharta Experience \n4.  In 1998, Danaharta was established by the Malaysian Government as the national asset \nmanagement corporation (AMC) to avert a collapse of the banking system due to the Asian \nfinancial crisis.  Its purpose was to remove the NPL distraction from financial institutions by \nbuying and rehabilitating NPLs while extracting maximum recovery value from them.  \n \n5.  Danaharta  completed  its  NPL  acquisitions  in  2000,  and  between  then  and  2005, \nrecovery action on most of the loans took place. By 30 September 2005, the final tally of \nDanaharta\u2019s NPL portfolio amounted to RM47.68 billion, of which RM19.71 million constituted \nacquired NPLs1 and RM27.97 million, managed NPLs.2 In total, there were 2,902 accounts \nbelonging to 2,563 borrowers (some borrowers had more than one loan account). The RM19.71 \nbillion of acquired NPLs were acquired at a purchase price of RM8.94 billion, implying an \naverage discount rate of 54.6%.  \n                                                 \n1   Acquired NPLs are those paid for in cash and through the issuance of Danaharta\u2019s zero-coupon bonds. \n2   Managed NPLs cost Danaharta nothing to \u201cacquire\u201d, since Danaharta merely managed these loans on behalf of the \nGovernment and Bank Negara Malaysia (Central Bank). ", "2   \n \n6.  Gross NPL levels in the banking system in Malaysia have been falling post-Danaharta \ncarve-outs, from a high of RM61.9 billion ($16.3 billion)3 in 2001 to RM45.2 billion ($11.9 \nbillion)4 as of end-2005. Malaysia\u2019s net NPL ratio as of end-2005 stood at 6.0%, well below the \n13.6% recorded in 1998 at the height of the Asian financial crisis.  As of 31 January 2007, net \nNPLs  stood  at  RM26.6  billion,  or  4.6%  of  total  net  loans.  However,  there  is  room  for \nimprovement, especially with the emphasis on risk management in relation to Basel II capital \nadequacy standards, targeted for compliance in 2008. \n \n2.  Recent Developments \n7.  In December 2005, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) issued \u201cGuidelines for the Sale of \nNPLs by Banking Institutions\u201d (the BNM Guidelines for NPLs), to allow Malaysian banks to \ndispose of NPLs of up to RM46 billion to other banks or domestic and foreign investors via \nspecial-purpose vehicles (SPVs). The guidelines were issued just as Danaharta was closing its \ndoors after 7.5 years of operation.5  The guidelines do not provide any other form of incentives, \nwhich are common in many countries embarking on NPL sales, i.e., tax exemption for stamp \nduty and other transaction costs. Appendix 3 presents the salient points of the guidelines. \n \n8.  Since then, the country has witnessed only one major NPL transaction. In January 2007, \nMalayan Banking Berhad (Maybank), Malaysia\u2019s largest bank, announced the sale of a portfolio \nof corporate NPLs consisting of almost 100 borrowers with a face value of RM2.2 billion ($612 \nmillion) to Standard Chartered Bank and Standard Bank of South Africa Group for a total \nconsideration of RM424.8 billion ($123.30 million). The sale was completed in June 2007.   This \nwas the first time a Malaysian bank undertook such a sale by competitive open bidding.  When \nthe transaction was announced, it was widely felt that activity levels in the NPL market would \npick up substantially with other Malaysian banks joining in the foray, with a portfolio sale having \nbeen completed, and that major disposals would follow closely. However, no other transactions \nhave followed as yet.  \n \n3.  Opportunities \n9.  Malaysia enjoys a number of advantages for NPL investment. The legal system is seen \nas both developed and robust compared with that in other NPL markets in Asia, and the political \nclimate has proven to be historically stable. The real estate sector has also shown considerable \ngrowth in recent years across most sectors. Add to that the greater number of recovery options \nfor holders of debt (receivership being one), and the perception that the risk profile of the \nMalaysian market appears lower than that of many of its Asian neighbors. \n \n10.  Regulatory actions are seen as a prime catalyst to force a significant proportion of the \nexisting NPL stock off the balance sheets of the Malaysian banks. Since 2 years ago, BNM had \nimposed tightened loan provisioning guidelines for NPLs aged more than 5 years. This has \nprovided incentives to banks to either resolve or dispose of these loans to avoid having to \ncreate  additional  provisions,  or  clean  up  their  books.  This  fits  well  with  the  impending \ncompliance with Basel II in 2008 and the ongoing liberalization of Malaysia\u2019s financial sector. \n \n                                                 \n3 $1 = RM3.800 as of 31 December 2001. \n4 $1 = RM3.779 as of 31 December 2005. \n5 Danaharta ceased operations on 31 December 2005. ", "      3\n11.  One feature of the Malaysian NPL market is the requirement for buyers to be at least \n51% domestically owned, meaning that any SPV established for an NPL transaction is limited to \n49% foreign ownership. Unlike in many other Asian markets, this has led to early involvement of \ndomestic investor groups, rather than 1-2 years into the sales cycle, which seems to be the \nnorm. \n \n12.  To date, a number of investor groups have indicated their desire to acquire portfolios \nand/or large single credits. However, on the sell-side, except for Maybank (para. 8), banking \ninstitutions are not rushing to sell. Clearly, the next 2 years will be critical in inducing buyers and \nsellers into the Malaysian NPL market and establishing Malaysia as a fully developed NPL \nmarket. \n \n13.  In December 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) teamed up with Asia Debt \nManagement  Hong  Kong  Limited  (ADM)  right  after  the  announcement  of  the  new  BNM \nGuidelines on NPLs in December.  A joint mission was scheduled in early 2006 to explore \nopportunities, and the transaction proposed in this report and recommendation of the President \n(RRP) is a direct result of those efforts. \n   \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Background \n14.  ADM and HSBC have been in discussion as early as 2 years ago regarding the disposal \nof HSBC\u2019s Portfolio. The transaction is on track to be the first negotiated NPL deal with third- \nparty  debt  financing  in  Malaysia  to  reach  financial  close,  pursuant  to  BNM\u2019s  issuance  of \nGuidelines for NPLs, and is expected to help catalyze the fledgling NPL market in Malaysia.   \n \nB.  The Project Sponsors \n1.  Asia Debt Management Hong Kong Limited \n15.  ADM,  founded  in  1996,  is  an  investment  advisor  registered  with  the  Hong  Kong \nSecurities and Futures Commission. ADM manages distressed assets and special situations in \nAsia, Europe, and other countries. It has developed a strong track record in identifying and \nsuccessfully realizing value from distressed debt opportunities in Asia, and is one of Asia\u2019s \nleading specialist managers of Asian distressed assets.  ADM has also developed a close \nnetwork of well-connected local partners and joint ventures in India, Indonesia, Republic of \nKorea,  Philippines,  and  Thailand  to  source  deal  opportunities  and  obtain  an  in-depth \nunderstanding of local market conditions.       \n \n16.  Since  its  inception,  ADM  has  turned  over  in  excess  of  $3  billion  in  face  value  of \ndistressed debt and has been directly involved in restructuring over $2 billion in distressed \nassets.  ADM advises the open-ended Galleus Fund, which has received several awards as one \nof the best performing funds in its class and in Asia, and a series of closed-end Maculus funds \n(ADM Maculus Fund I, II, and III). In April 2007, the Asian Investor gave the Best Distressed \nFund award to ADM Maculus Fund I, II, and III.  \n  \n17.  ADM Maculus III (ADM III) will be the economic buyer, respectively the \u201cequity provider\u201d, \nof the Portfolio being sold. \n \n \n ", "4   \n2.  HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad \n18.  HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad (HSBC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the HSBC Group, \none of the largest banking and financial service organizations in the world. Its international \nnetwork comprises about 10,000 offices in 82 countries and territories, operating in the Asia \nPacific region, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. \n \n19.  HSBC\u2019s presence in Malaysia dates back to more than 120 years when the Hongkong \nand Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited established its first office in Penang in 1884. This \nwas followed by offices in Ipoh, Malacca, Johor Bahru, and Kuala Lumpur in 1910. Since then \nthe bank has expanded its network to 40 branches nationwide and employs approximately \n5,000 employees.    \n \n20.  HSBC  was  incorporated  in  October  1984  and  was  the  first  foreign-owned  financial \ninstitution to be localized when operations were transferred from the Hongkong and Shanghai \nBanking Corporation Limited in January 1994. HSBC\u2019s pioneering role reflects its long-term \ncommitment  to  its  customers  and  to  Malaysia.  It  has  won  various  local  and  international \naccolades from FinanceAsia including Best Foreign Commercial Bank in Malaysia in 2005 and \nBest Foreign Bank in Malaysia in 2006. \n \n21.  HSBC will be the seller of the Portfolio. \n \nC.  Servicer \n22.  Established in 1998, ACAP is a financial services company based in Thailand focusing \nprimarily on loan asset management, corporate finance advisory and rehabilitation planning, \nand  administration.  ACAP  presently  employs  about  160  staff  located  in  its  two  offices  in \nBangkok.  \n \n23.  ACAP\u2019s Asset Management Division was established in 2004 to provide full servicing of \nnonperforming loans and assets for client owners of loan portfolios. Services offered include \ncontacting and negotiating with debtors, determining plans of action for each case, tracking loan \npayments, managing legal procedures, selling asset collateral, and maintaining a customer and \nloan database. Current and past portfolios managed by ACAP amount to Thai baht 54 billion \n($16 billion) in principal value. ACAP currently manages more than 35,000 loan accounts. \n  \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB INVESTMENT \nA.  ADB Investment \n24.  ADB is contemplating the provision of a senior secured loan (the Senior Loan) to EMSB \n(or a related entity) in an amount of up to $10 million. It is likely that the financing will be coursed \nthrough one of ADM\u2019s SPVs to ensure compliance with approvals that have been obtained by \nEMSB.  \n \n25.  The ADB investment will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will not \nexceed $10 million or 50% of the total project cost, whichever is lower.  \n \n \n \n ", "      5\nB.  Main Terms and Conditions \n26.  The proposed Senior Loan will be structured as a senior secured debt with a priority \nposition in collection proceeds received by EMSB under the Portfolio, whether from debt service \npayments  on  loan  assets,  rents  or  disposition  proceeds  on  foreclosed  assets,  interest  or \ninvestment income from other sources. \n \nV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \nA.  Justification of ADB\u2019s Investment \n1.  Investment Objective \n27.  ADB\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  EMSB  in  acquiring  HSBC\u2019s  NPL  portfolio  through  the \nprovision of debt financing to fund the purchase price of the Portfolio. \n \n2.  Development Outcome \n28.  The proposed ADB investment will promote development at the following key levels. \n \n(i)  Catalyze the Malaysian NPL market. At the beginning of a new NPL market, \nlocal lenders often are not available to provide third-party financing to investors. \nThis is, however, essential in a functioning market for NPL resolution and a key \nfeature in all mature markets. By providing third-party debt financing for the \npurchase of NPLs in Malaysia, lenders such as ADB are able to bridge the \npricing gap that prevents the sale of NPLs. Because investors can obtain loans at \nrates that are significantly less than their equity capital costs, they can pay more \nfor NPLs than if they invested on an all-equity basis. As a result, ADB can \ncontribute by helping local financial institutions recover higher market values from \ntheir distressed assets and make constructive efforts to remove such assets from \ntheir books. Experience has shown that over time, traditional lenders enter the \nmarket and replace early NPL financiers eventually. Until such time, ADB  seeks \nto play a catalytic role in energizing the distressed asset market in Malaysia. By \nits  intervention,  ADB  will  demonstrate  the  credibility  of  this  asset  class  and \nmobilize capital to support similar efforts in Malaysia and throughout Asia.  \n \n(ii)  Provide an NPL resolution demonstration effect. Through the execution of the \nfirst negotiated NPL purchase from a Malaysian private sector bank with debt \nfinancing from a third party, ADB\u2019s proposed investment will help jump-start the \nMalaysian NPL market by implementing bankable NPL sales actually reaching \nfinancial close. The Project will achieve a demonstration effect by introducing a \nreplicable, market-tested mechanism for NPL resolution that can be reproduced \nand will induce the development of the NPL market in Malaysia (as it develops \nbenchmarks, bankable structures, and trust in the enabling legal and regulatory \nenvironment). It also sends a strong signal to Malaysian banks to proactively \naddress their NPL problems.  \n \n(iii)  Create a best-practice mortgage NPL servicing entity in Malaysia. With the \nsetting up of the ACAP subsidiary in Malaysia, the first best-practices servicing \nplatform for nonperforming mortgage loans will be created in the country. The \nACAP platform envisages employment, training, and utilization of a number of \n ", "6   \nlocal professionals, who will augment the pool of available talent in the Malaysian \nfinancial sector.  \n \n3.  Value Added of ADB \n29.  ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will be highly catalytic and demonstrative, as other \nfinancial institutions begin to enter the NPL market in Malaysia. With ADB being a critical force \nin supporting distressed debt sales in the region, ADB\u2019s presence in the transaction will add an \nextra level of confidence in Malaysia\u2019s fledgling NPL market. ADB is building on its very positive \nexperience in the Philippines, where similar interventions helped in jump-starting the Philippine \nNPL market, resulting in the reduction of NPL levels to the present 5.21%. The transaction will \nbe one of the earliest transactions to come to market and thus, may serve as a benchmark for \nfuture  transactions  in  Malaysia.  The  success  of  this  transaction,  in  part  through  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation,  (i)  will  clearly  encourage  other  private  sector  players  to  engage  in  similar \ntransactions, resulting in more resources and expertise to be channeled toward viable NPL \nresolution in Malaysia; and (ii) would position Malaysia as one of the major focus countries for \nNPL investors in Asia in the coming years.   \n \n4.  Design and Monitoring Framework \n30.  ADB has prepared a design and monitoring framework and will measure the expected \ndevelopment impact of the investment, in accordance with ADB\u2019s management development \nresults policy (Appendix 12). \n \n5.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy \na.  Sector Strategy \n31.  A sound and efficient financial sector is a prerequisite for broad-based, private sector-led \neconomic development that will directly contribute to poverty reduction. ADB, recognizing that \nthe recovery of lending activities in the financial sector is vital to this goal, has made assistance \nto address the overhang of NPLs in both public and private financial institutions as  one of its \nkey thrusts.  \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s proposed participation in the transaction will build on its strategy of helping its \ndeveloping member countries tackle the burden of distressed assets and NPLs, and build a \nsound and efficient financial sector. For example, in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), ADB \nhelped  the  Cinda  Asset  Management  Corporation  (Cinda)  deal  with  NPLs.  ADB  technical \nassistance (TA)6 was given immediately after Cinda was established in 2001 to (i) provide \nCinda  with  the  technology  to  complete  its  mandate  to  undertake  financial  and  corporate \nrestructuring  of  companies  whose  assets  were  foreclosed,  (ii)  equip  Cinda  with  the  latest \ntechniques used for the purchase and disposition of NPLs to achieve sufficient returns from \nfunds  injected  to  acquire  NPLs,  and  (iii)  help  Cinda  implement  appropriate  management \ninformation systems. The TA has quickly established Cinda operationally and provided broad \nrecommendations on various legal and regulatory issues to policy makers in the Government of \nthe PRC. A second TA7 was approved to assist in developing an effective and comprehensive \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  policy  framework  for  asset-backed  securities  (ABS)  transactions  by \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Institutional Strengthening of the Cinda \nAsset Management Company. Manila (TA 3303-PRC).  \n7 ADB. 2005.

", "      7\nstructuring the issuance of an international/domestic ABS for Cinda. In India, ADB provided a \nTA to enable and structure asset reconstruction companies.8\n \n33.  Through  its  private  sector  operations,  ADB  was  highly  instrumental  in  laying  the \ngroundwork for creating and developing an NPL market in the Philippines (paras. 74\u201379).   ADB \nwas also involved in the ADM Maculus I and Maculus II funds, the Yangtze Special Situations \nFund (PRC) and the formation of Actis Asset Reconstruction Company (India). \n \n34.  The Philippine NPL Market. In 2005, ADB supported the auction of the National Home \nMortgage  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  (NHMFC)  portfolio  of  delinquent  nonperforming  mortgage \nloans by providing debt financing of up to $33 million to Balikatan Housing, Inc. (Balikatan), the \nSPV jointly owned by a Deutsche Bank fund (DBGO) and NHMFC. Balikatan acquired the NPLs \nfrom NHMFC and is subsequently resolving them. ADB also invested in a 10% equity stake in \nBahay Financial Services, Inc. (BFS), a loan servicing company that was set up by DBGO to \nrestructure and service the NPLs on behalf of Balikatan.  \n \n35.  ADB was involved in the transaction from the very beginning, working alongside NHMFC \nand  its  external  advisors  in  putting  together  a  bankable  structure.  Given  the  difficulty  of \nobtaining local or international debt financing for a new and untested asset class at the time, \nADB played a critical role by providing third-party financing support. That ADB made such \nfinancing available helped to encourage DBGO\u2019s participation and set a precedent for them. \nFurthermore, by introducing a debt layer into the capital structure of the project, ADB  was able \nto increase the cash purchase price paid by DBGO to NHMFC, as this allowed DBGO to submit \na bid on a leveraged basis (versus on a total equity basis), given that local lenders were not yet \nready to enter this type of market. Without ADB\u2019s offer of support, the pricing gap between \nNHMFC\u2019s reserve price and DBGO\u2019s bid price might not have been bridged,and could have \ncaused  the  auction  to  fail.  ADB\u2019s  support  in  the  early  stages  of  the  transaction  also  lent \ncredibility and provided considerable comfort to the potential investors that the sale of the \nPortfolio  would  be  implemented  with  transparency  and  in  accordance  with  international \nstandards and best practices. \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s ongoing involvement as a shareholder in BFS also ensures best practices and \ncredibility  to  the  company\u2019s  operations  as  it  services  and  resolves  the  portfolio.    BFS\u2019 \nperformance in its first year of operations has been very positive; it collected $14.5 million \nversus a target of $6.3 million.  Given that these cash flows are a result of BFS\u2019 \u201ctouching\u201d only \n23% of the portfolio, such performance is expected to continue or improve further once BFS is \nable to \u201ctouch\u201d the remaining 77% of the portfolio. BFS has its head office in Makati, and plans \nto establish a branch in Alabang, Muntinlupa, are under way to better service accounts.  BFS is \nalso expected to employ a total of 300 staff by the end of its second year as it ramps up its \noperations.   \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s participation in the NHMFC transaction was highly catalytic and demonstrative, as \nother financial institutions entered the NPL market in the Philippines shortly thereafter. The \nsuccess of this landmark transaction, in part through ADB\u2019s participation, clearly encouraged \nother private sector players to engage in similar transactions, resulting in more resources and \nexpertise channeled toward viable NPL resolution and housing finance sector reform in the \nPhilippines. This outcome was recognized in the Office of Evaluation Department\u2019s study on \nADB\u2019s operations in the Philippines.  \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Developing the Enabling Environment for and Structuring Asset \nReconstruction Companies in India. Manila (TA 3943-IND). \n ", "8   \n  \n38.  In its second NPL transaction in the Philippines, ADB assisted Bayerische Hypo-und \nVereinsbank  AG  (HVB)  in  2005  in  the  purchase  of  Equitable  PCI  Bank\u2019s  portfolio  of \nnonperforming loans and assets through the provision of debt financing. ADB\u2019s loan was repaid \nwithin a year, ahead of projections. Since then, HVB has been an active participant in the \nPhilippine NPL market and acquired a number of NPL portfolios from several local banks.   \n \n39.  Both transactions in which ADB participated helped generate considerable momentum \nfor the Philippine NPL market, which has become one of the most active in Asia in recent years.  \nIn  addition,  the  banking  sector\u2019s  NPL  ratio  stood  at  5.21%  as  of  end-June  2007,  an \nimprovement from the 7.22% NPL ratio registered a year ago, and a significant decline from the \ndouble-digit  NPL  levels  after  the  Asian  crisis.  ADB  is  determined  to  repeat  this  positive \nexperience in other markets.   \n \nb.  Country Strategy  \n40.  Following  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  the  late  1990s,  Malaysia  largely  eschewed \nborrowing from multilateral assistance sources. No new loans from ADB had been approved \nsince  1998.  ADB  has  not  prepared  an  operational  strategy  for  Malaysia  since  July  1997.  \nHowever, the proposed transaction would be in line with the Government of Malaysia\u2019s efforts in \nencouraging its financial institutions to resolve significant portions of existing NPL stock in its \nbooks, and the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to effectively deregulate and liberalize its capital \nmarket.  \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n41.  The  proposed  investment  is  classified  as  Category  C  for  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard classifications. A desk review of the environmental and social implications indicates \nthat the Project will not have any direct or immediate impact on the environment and on social \nsafeguard issues.  No involuntary resettlement is expected.  \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n42.  ADM and ACAP were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require EMSB through covenants in the documentation to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism; \nand  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation between ADB and ADM and ACAP will further allow ADB to investigate any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n43.  The  proposed  investment  would, once  approved  by  the  Board,  represent  1.34%  of \nADB\u2019s total nonsovereign exposure9 in Malaysia, and increase ADB\u2019s nonsovereign portfolio \n                                                 \n9 Exposure refers to drawn and undrawn portions of PSOD\u2019s Board-approved (signed, i.e., not necessarily committed) \nnonsovereign loan, equity investments, and guarantees, as of 31 December 2006.   ", "      9\ninvestment in (i) Malaysia from 0.01% to 0.27%; and (ii) in capital markets from 1.52% to 1.32%.  \nThe proposed investment is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, industry, group, and single project \nexposure limits for private sector projects. \n \n44.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  transaction  agreements  and  other  legally  required \ndocuments, following approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. The \nagreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. In addition, ADB will need to be \nsatisfied with all terms and conditions of any other documents associated with the proposed \nfinancial assistance. \n \n45.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed ADB investment. \nNo funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n46.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve a dollar-denominated \nsenior secured loan of up to $10,000,000 to Eucalypt Mortgages Sdn. Bhd. (or a related entity) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n10 October 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "10   Appendix 1 \nBENEFITS OF THE RESOLUTION OF NONPERFORMING LOANS \n \n1.  Accelerating the Asian restructuring process is vital in regenerating regional growth, \npreserving  investments  in  companies  or  projects  to  make  them  financially  viable,  getting \nbusinesses going forward rather than avoiding creditors, reestablishing confidence so that new \ninvestors will step forward to finance the continuing massive infrastructure needs, and getting \npeople back to work (or protecting otherwise viable employment). For Asia as a whole, the \npresence of large numbers of companies that have defaulted weighs heavily on the banking and \nfinancial system. Even in cases where bad debts have been sold or have been transferred to \nasset management companies, the presence of large numbers of distressed companies weigh \nheavily  on  the  economy  as  they  are  relatively  unproductive.  In  some  cases,  the  optimum \nsolution may be closure, but in most cases the underlying companies continue to be productive \nand recover strongly once the weight of bad debt is removed.  \n \n2.  The Asian development experience has shown that growth is one of the most powerful \nweapons in the fight against poverty. Growth creates the need for labor, the main asset of the \npoor. As growth continues, private sector employment becomes the major source of economic \nsupport for the majority of workers and their families. Growth also broadens the tax base, \nenabling governments to finance social services such as health and education.1  \n \n3.  To restore the health of the banking industry in the targeted countries, it is necessary to \nwork on corporate restructuring as was the case with the success of the Republic of Korea after \nthe financial crisis of 1997. Vulnerability in the banking system and the economy is a result of \nrapid growth that outpaced the establishment of sound regulation, the building of institutional \ncapacities, and formulation of sound corporate governance principles. The development of a \nsound and efficient financial sector is a prerequisite for broad-based private sector-led economic \ndevelopment  that  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  Not  addressing  the  problem  of \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  would  translate  into  a  further  drain  on  future  resources  and \npotential earnings and impair capital significantly. As credit costs increase to cover the cost of \nNPL losses, financial institutions resist making fresh loans. Tighter credit restricts economic \ngrowth as enterprises are unable to access capital. Selling NPLs will alleviate these problems \nand help stimulate economic growth in the respective countries. \n \n4.  The benefits of resolving an NPL crisis are well-proven, judging from the success of \ncountries outside of Asia, for instance, the US or Sweden (both of which of course had other \nsupporting factors).  In those countries, once the level of NPLs dropped, the national economy \nbegan to recover and grow; companies and businesses started creating new jobs; and investors, \nnow more confident of a country\u2019s long-term growth prospects, began to pump investment \ncapital into the country\u2019s stock, bond, and property markets as well as individual companies and \nbusinesses.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.

A  company  can  be  defined  as  a  collection  of  contracting  relationships  among \nindividuals\u2014a \u201cnexus of contracts.\u201d2 The contracts make it possible for the company to conduct \nbusiness. The parties to these contracts include shareholders, creditors, managers, employees, \nsuppliers, and customers\u2014in other words, anyone who has a claim on the firm\u2019s profits and \ncash flows. Therefore, restructuring is the process by which firms change these contracts. What \nusually  drives  firms  to  restructure  is  some  opportunity  to  increase  their  market  value. \nRestructuring can be very costly, however, so the value gap must be large enough to make it \nworthwhile.  \n \n2.  One of the most compelling reasons to restructure is to address poor performance, i.e., \nto address losses in market value caused by poor performance or financial distress. Such \nlosses may or may not be the management\u2019s fault: the management may have overdiversified \ninto too many businesses or borrowed too aggressively. On the other hand, the firm\u2019s problems \ncould be caused by an economic recession or an adverse change in currency exchange rates \n(the two other main reasons for restructuring are to pursue strategic opportunities or to correct \nvaluation errors). \n \nB.  Overview of Restructuring \n \n3.  There  are  a  number  of  ways  to  resolve  unsustainable  corporate  debt.  The  usual \nresponse  would  be  for  the  company  to  raise  new  equity,  if  possible,  and/or  undertake \n\u201coperational restructuring\u201d (e.g., discontinue less profitable or loss-incurring businesses, lay off  \nexcess labor, and reduce other costs to increase the company\u2019s earnings and debt service \ncapacity, plus sell noncore businesses and assets\u2014such as real estate\u2014to retire debt).  \n \n4.  If it appears that operational restructuring cannot reduce corporate debt to a sustainable \nlevel, or that stopgap liquidity is needed prior to such action, \u201cfinancial restructuring\u201d becomes \nappropriate. For example, creditors, either new or existing, could convert debt into equity and/or \ninto lower-yielding corporate bonds, which usually requires a loss or \u201chaircut\u201d with regard to the \noriginal terms of the to-be restructured debt (through a reduction of principal or by forgiving \ninterest/penalties or extending the maturity of the facility).  \n \n5.  The mix and sequencing of such operational and financial restructuring measures for a \ndistressed company will depend on the severity of the company\u2019s problems and differences \namong the interested parties. In essence, if the company\u2019s underlying business is nonviable, \nliquidation  is  appropriate.  However,  if  the  company  is  viable,  albeit  overindebted,  financial \nand/or corporate restructuring presents the best route forward. \n \n                                                 \n1 This section is a summary of current research on the benefits of corporate and financial restructuring from the \nfollowing sources: ADB. 2000.

Macroeconomic Implications and Policy Considerations  \n \n1.  Market-Led Approaches to Restructuring I: Decentralization of Decisions \n6.  Corporate  restructuring  is  an  ongoing  process  that  separates  those  firms  that  can \nsurvive and prosper from those that are too overwhelmed by current challenges and flounder. \nGovernments  have  only  a  limited  role  to  play  in  such  restructuring,  except  to  ensure  an \neconomic environment in which resources can be redeployed to new uses at minimal cost. \nHowever, when distress is widespread, there is a danger that it may be self-reinforcing. \n  \n7.  Several types of coordination issues arise. Firms may have low incentives to restructure \nbecause other distressed firms\u2014and, by implication, consumers\u2014have a low demand for their \nproducts. Also, distressed firms are unable to repay debts, maintaining the pressure on financial \ninstitutions, which, in turn, restrict new lending that may be required to revive sectors where \neffective demand exists. Financial institutions may become insolvent, reducing the incentive of \nborrowers to repay loans. The judicial system will be overwhelmed with cases and will have  no \nmechanism to prioritize which case to treat first.  \n \n8.  To break out of this vicious cycle, on a macro-economic level three approaches have \nbeen employed. The first strategy is to depend on economic recovery to release the constraint \non demand, thus improving cash flows and the repayment ability of firms. Such recovery can be \nengineered  by  increased  government  spending  but  may  be  limited  by  fiscal  constraints, \nparticularly in times of systemic distress. Recovery may also occur if the demand for exports is \nbuoyant, as was the case in Mexico after the 1994\u20131995 crisis and in the Republic of Korea and \nMalaysia following the recent Asian crisis, with both countries benefiting from rapid growth in the \ntrade of electronics products. However, reliance on an economic upturn may be na\u00efve, as \nevidenced by the continued stagnation of the corporate sector in Japan over the last decade.  \n \n9.  Furthermore, economic recovery by itself has proven to be insufficient in countries like \nIndonesia  and  Thailand,  where  more  than  half  of  the  corporate  sector  was  at  one  point \nexperiencing distress. Many firms were in distress, not just because of an economy-wide crisis \nbut because imprudent investment decisions had been made. The evidence shows that the \ndistress of such firms and financial institutions persists for long periods, rendering the economy \nvulnerable to renewed financial pressures.  \n \n10.  For this reason, the next set of alternatives is a variety of market-based measures, which \nneed not require any fiscal layouts. Under this approach, the government sets the rules under \nwhich creditors and debtors work out their claims in a decentralized manner. These rules \ninclude rules governing normal restructuring and bankruptcy; enhanced measures for resolving \nfinancial claims (through special rules or moral suasion that supplements existing bankruptcy \nprocedures); reduction of barriers to transfer of ownership and redeployment of resources \n(including more liberal foreign direct investment, mergers and acquisitions, and greater mobility \nin labor markets); and \u201csuper-bankruptcy\u201d processes that, once again, change the incentives for \nthe restructuring of claims.  \n \n11.  The common feature of these decentralized approaches, whether normal creditor-led \nworkouts,  enhanced  \u201cmarket-based,\u201d  or  super-bankruptcy  approaches,  is  that  they  rely  on \nincentives and penalties for restructuring rather than on either government fiscal stimuli\u2014as in \nthe case of an engineered recovery\u2014or on the assumption by the government of financial \nliabilities of bankrupt firms and financial institutions. In some cases, however, where economic \nrecovery and enhanced incentives for restructuring are insufficient, governments may face the ", "    Appendix 2  13\nassumption of financial liabilities or provide other forms of government support to shore up the \nfinancial or corporate sectors. Related to that is the degree to which governments should \nexercise regulatory forbearance on financial institutions in distress. Where governments do \nexpend fiscal resources and assume nonperforming loans, they also seek to recover some part \nof  those  resources  through  centralized  asset  management  companies.  In  practice,  the \ndependence  on  economic  recovery,  sharper  incentives  and  tougher  penalties,  and  the \nassumption of financial liabilities go together. This is demonstrated by a variety of country \nexamples. It is thus difficult to isolate the effects and benefits of pursuing an economic-recovery-\nonly approach.  \n   \n12.  Some lessons on systemic restructuring have also become clear. There is a need to limit \nthe government\u2019s role in establishing the enabling environment (insolvency, tax, accounting, etc., \neventually providing resources) for the private sector to do the necessary restructuring. It has \nalso become clear that it is important to adjust the approach to the type of assets, which are \ncausing  the  distress.  To  the  extent  that  the  government  directly  intervenes  in  systemic \nrestructurings, it should be careful on how it deals with \u201closers\u201d (particularly banks and other \nfinancial institutions). \n \n2.  Market-Led Approaches to Restructuring II: More Benefits, Less Cost \n13.  A market-led approach to restructuring has, in principle, three main attractions. First, by \ndrawing on private rather than public resources to facilitate restructuring, it helps limit costs to \nthe taxpayer. Equitable cost-sharing arrangements under a market-led approach should help \nmitigate problems of moral hazard and create incentives for more efficient monitoring. Second, \na market-led approach generally works better in recovering the value of nonperforming and bad \nloans than a bureaucratically administered system. Competition in the acquisition and disposal \nof  assets  should  eventually  make  for  more  efficient  debt  workouts.  Finally,  a  market-led \napproach  should  enhance  systemic  efficiency  and  safety.  These  benefits  follow  if  market \nplayers who are better capitalized and managed are able to increase their market share at the \nexpense of those that are weak and are a potential threat to system stability. \n \n14.  Corporate  difficulties  may  be  resolved  by  the  market  or  within  special-purpose \nframeworks  intended  to  ease  coordination  problems.  Market  solutions  entail  mergers, \nacquisitions,  and  bankruptcies  within  an  established  framework  of  company  law.  Special- \npurpose frameworks may be either voluntary or compulsory. Voluntary frameworks are usually \npreferred since they provide an opportunity for the rehabilitation of asset values and a recovery \nof debt. The role of such agencies is crucial when there are many interlocking debtors and \ncreditors. Negotiations among these parties are usually guided by a set of well-defined rules. \nThese would normally assert creditors\u2019 rights, while providing some breathing space during \nwhich businesses enjoy a stay on their debt. The rules are likely to require that debtors submit \nplans for financial and operational restructuring to creditors for their approval. To help resolve \ncoordination problems, majority voting on these and other matters is the norm. To the extent \nthat voluntary arrangements work, both debtors and creditors should benefit. If they fail, or if  no \nagreement  can  be  reached,  resolution  of  debts  would  normally  occur  through  bankruptcy \nproceedings. Therefore, for voluntary arrangements to work there should also be a credible \nthreat of action under binding foreclosure and bankruptcy procedures. If these do not exist, \nvoluntary frameworks are unlikely to achieve much. Normally, some combination of market and \nspecial-purpose frameworks for debt resolution will be applied. \n \n \n ", "14  Appendix 2 \n3.  Restructuring: Prevention and Resolution of Financial Crisis \n15.  Weaknesses in the financial and corporate sectors were at the heart of the Asian crisis. \nIn  a  situation  where  rapid  financial  liberalization  had  outpaced  institutional  capacities, \nvulnerabilities accumulated and put at risk the solvency of large parts of the affected economies. \nInadequate regulation, weak supervision of financial institutions, poor accounting standards and \ndisclosure rules, outmoded laws, corporate recklessness, and inferior governance all played \ntheir part. Together, these factors seemed to legitimize investor panic that culminated in the \ndisorderly collapse of asset prices and exchange rates. Prompted in part by the terms of \ninternational assistance packages, the affected economies have now embarked on the complex \nand time-consuming task of tackling these institutional deficits.  \n \n16.  Stanley Fischer, formerly of the International Monetary Fund and now with Citigroup, \ndescribed the importance of corporate restructuring, particularly in the aftermath of a crisis, as a \nvital  accompaniment  to  banking  restructuring:  \u201cAt  this  stage,  bank  and  corporate  debt \nrestructuring should be closely coordinated, but often are not because of lack of capacity, data, \nand sheer complexity of the banks. Bank restructuring cannot take place in isolation from \ncorporate restructuring.\u201d  \n \n17.  Instruments designed to mitigate the severity of bubbles as well as support remedial \nmeasures to deal with their aftereffects include a secondary market for debt, corporate financial \nrestructuring  funds,  corporate  restructuring  vehicles,  real  estate  investment  trusts,  and \nsecuritization.  Two  of  the  products\u2014corporate  financial  restructuring  funds  and  corporate \nrestructuring vehicles\u2014were successfully used in Korea after 1997, which sought to develop \nmarket solutions to facilitate the restructuring process in the aftermath of the Asian financial \ncrisis. The Korean initiative might serve as a model for other countries. \n \n4.  Restructuring: Acceleration of Local Financial Competency \n18.  Provided that a country has a rich set of financial sector skills, it can develop a wider \nrange of investment and risk management mechanisms that can help transfer liquidity, market, \nand credit risks and thereby dampen the volatility of the financial system. The prerequisite is \nthat, in order to develop sophisticated financial market instruments, countries first need to \nacquire a base of human capital.  \n \n19.  Similar  to  service  sector  skills,  market-based  instruments  play  an  important  role  in \nmitigating  the  magnitude  of  bubbles  as  well  as  in  expediting  the  mop-up  process.  In  the \naftermath of the Asian crisis, there is increasing recognition of the importance of corporate and \nfinancial sector restructuring and the challenges that restructuring poses in the absence of \nskilled financial sector expertise. It is believed that the buildup, duration, and severity of bubbles \nin equity and real estate markets, as well as the restructuring that occurs in the aftermath of \nsuch bubbles, are related to the availability of skills in financial sector services. Countries that \nhave  capable  professionals  such  as  appraisers,  analysts,  and  insolvency  experts  have \nrecognized and responded more swiftly to asset bubbles than countries with a limited base of \nskills in the financial sector. In addition, countries benefit from the development of market \ninstruments that spread risks, such as secondary markets in distressed debt. \n \n5.  Public Policy Considerations \n20.  According  to  academic  and  multilateral  researchers,  policy  measures  directed  at \ndeveloping market-based instruments in distressed debt and corporate restructuring funds are ", "    Appendix 2  15\nneeded to bring greater transparency, efficiency, and liquidity to emerging markets. Policy \nmakers need to remove the legal impediments to the development of a market for securitization \nthrough legislation enabling a legal structure for trusts, tax neutrality, and amendments to the \ninsolvency legislation. Similarly, development of standard documentation for trading distressed \ncorporate loans will lead to greater consistency, transparency, and therefore liquidity in the \ndistressed debt market. To avoid moral hazard, the new set of creditors should retain some \nequity  instrument  (e.g.,  convertible  bonds,  debt-equity  swaps,  options,  or  warrants)  to \nparticipate  in  any  recovery  while  placing  pressure  on  existing  equity  holders  to  enforce \nimprovement measures. Term extensions may be acceptable, so long as they do not have the \npractical effect of transforming debt into an equity-like instrument without also giving creditors \nthe  rights  of  equity  holders.  Reducing  interest  below  the  risk-adjusted  rate  may  also  be \nacceptable, so long as the principal is repaid. \n \nD.  Cost of Restructuring \n \n1.  Cost of Restructuring and Value Creation \n21.  From  an  economic  perspective,  debt  restructuring  is  almost  always  preferred  over \nbankruptcy, as it is the less costly alternative, particularly when the firm in question remains a \nviable going concern. Every restructuring impacts the firm\u2019s market value for the same reason. \nThere are certain market frictions or institutional rigidities that make it difficult for the firm to re-\ncontract. Such frictions\u2014called \u201cmarket imperfections\u201d\u2014include transaction costs, agency costs, \ninformation costs, and taxes. \n \n22.  Transaction costs include all costs (both out-of-pocket costs and forgone opportunities) \nthat firms incur when they restructure (e.g., fees in a bankruptcy reorganization and severance \npayments to employees laid off in a downsizing program). Agency costs include the loss in \nmarket value when managers take actions that benefit themselves but harm shareholders. \nThese costs also include the costs to shareholders of trying to prevent managers from behaving \nthis  way.  Information  costs  include  the  costs  to  investors  of  acquiring  and  processing \ninformation about the firm\u2019s activities and opportunities. In practice, these costs can be lowered \nby  the  activities  of  financial  analysts,  who  provide  expert  commentary  and  analysis  about \ncompanies to investors. \n \n23.  Finally, taxes\u2014both corporate and personal\u2014are a critical concern in almost every \nrestructuring. If a firm wishes to rid itself of a business division (e.g., for strategic reasons), a \ncorporate spin-off can avoid the onerous tax liability created by an outright cash sale. A firm that \nreorganizes in Chapter 11 3may choose to keep its debt level relatively high, because issuing \nnew stock may limit its ability to use its net operating loss carry forwards. Understanding how \nthese  factors  can  impact  market  value  in  a  particular  situation  is  critical  for  successfully \nmanaging the restructuring process, addressing the firm\u2019s problems, and creating value. \n \n2.  Bankruptcy Costs \n24.  Investing in distressed situations involves purchasing the financial claims of firms that \nhave filed for legal bankruptcy protection or else are trying to avoid bankruptcy by negotiations \nand out-of-court restructuring with their creditors. The show case is the United States (US), \nwhere  corporate  bankruptcy  reorganizations  take  place  under  Chapter  11  of  the  U.S. \nBankruptcy Code. \n                                                 \n3 United States Code Title 11 (Bankruptcy Code). 1994. Reorganization. \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \n \n25.  An out-of-court restructuring can almost always be accomplished at much lower cost \nthan a court-supervised reorganization. Part of this difference reflects savings in legal and other \nadministrative costs. More importantly, Chapter 11 or similar bankruptcy regimes generally \nimpose a much heavier burden on the business because of the greater demands placed on \nmanagement\u2019s  time  and  costly  delays  engendered  by  litigation.  Consistent  with  this  cost \ndifferential, academic research4 has found that firms that successfully restructure their debt out \nof court experience significant increases in their common stock price (approximately 30%, on \naverage, after adjusting for risk and market movements) from the time they first experience \nfinancial distress to when they complete their restructuring. Over a corresponding interval, firms \nthat try to restructure out of court but fail experience significant average stock price declines \n(also in the order of 30%). \n \n26.  Several studies have measured the costs of the reorganization process. Warner (1977) \nand  Weiss  (1990)  conclude  that  the  direct  out-of-pocket  costs  of  Chapter  11  (including \nprofessionals\u2019 fees, court filing fees, etc.) are less than 5% of corporate assets, on average. \nHowever, these costs are proportionately much higher for smaller firms. Altman (1984), Opler \nand Titman (1994), and Kaplan and Andrade (1999) attempt to measure the business losses \ncaused by bankruptcy (for example, potential customers or suppliers may be reluctant to do \nbusiness with a bankrupt firm.) These costs are potentially much larger than out-of-pocket \nbankruptcy costs, but measuring them is difficult because business losses may be the cause, \nrather than the consequence, of bankruptcy. The studies conclude that these additional costs \naverage roughly 10%\u201325% of firms\u2019 stock market values before bankruptcy and that highly \nleveraged firms suffer greater losses of business than less leveraged firms during industry \ndownturns. Gilson, John, and Lang (1990) show that direct costs are significantly lower in out-\nof-court restructuring than in Chapter 11. This cost advantage gives most firms an incentive to \nrestructure out of court if they can. An alternative restructuring option that has gained popularity \nrecently is \u201cprepackaged\u201d Chapter 11, which allows firms to reorganize in Chapter 11 more \nquickly. Tashjian, Leas, and McConnell (1996) show that the costs of prepackaged Chapter 11 \nare midway between the costs of conventional Chapter 11 and out-of-court restructuring. \n \na.  Stock Prices and Long-Run Performance \n27.  Ahorony,  Jones,  and  Swary  (1980)  show  that  when  firms  file  for  bankruptcy,  their \ncommon stock prices decline significantly, on average (controlling for differences in firms\u2019 risk \nand market movements). Moreover, for up to 5 years before they enter bankruptcy, firms\u2019 stock \nprices significantly underperform in the market. Gilson, John, and Lang (1990) document that \nwhen distressed firms successfully restructure their debt out of court, their risk-adjusted stock \nprices increase by over 40%, on average, from the time they first default on their debt. In \ncontrast, firms that file for Chapter 11 suffer an average 40% stock price decline. This difference \nsuggests that for most firms, it is significantly less costly to resolve financial distress out of court. \nHotchkiss (1995) shows that after firms leave Chapter 11, they tend to be significantly less \nprofitable than the average for their industries. Consistent with Hotchkiss, Gilson (1997) finds \nthat roughly one in four companies that reorganize in Chapter 11 subsequently has to return to \nbankruptcy court (as so-called \u201cChapter 22s\u201d) because they either continue to perform poorly or \nleave Chapter 11 with too much debt. \n \n                                                 \n4  See Gilson, Stuart,  Kose John, and Larry Lang. 1990.

A number of studies have documented patterns in how financial distress is resolved. \nSeveral studies\u2014for example, Franks and Torous (1989, 1994); Eberhart, Moore, and Roenfeldt \n(1990); Weiss (1990); LoPucki and Whitford (1993)\u2015show that debt restructuring plans, both in \nand outside Chapter 11, exhibit strong deviations from the \u201crule of absolute priority\u201d. This rule, \nwhich has to be followed in a liquidation, states that no creditor or shareholder can receive \nanything of value under a restructuring plan unless all more senior claimholders have been \nmade whole. Absolute priority deviations typically mean that shareholders receive something of \nvalue in a restructuring, even though the firm is insolvent. This outcome is a by-product of the \nUS system, which encourages consensual reorganization of distressed firms. In other countries, \nwhere liquidation is more common or shareholders do not get to vote on the restructuring, \nabsolute priority is more likely to be observed. As for how firms resolve financial distress, Gilson, \nJohn,  and  Lang  (1990)  find  that  most  distressed  large  public  companies  are  successfully \nreorganized\u2014approximately half the time in Chapter 11 and half the time out of court. Firms that \nare able to restructure out of court typically have less complex capital structures, higher growth \nopportunities, and more bank debt. Finally, Gilson, Hotchkiss, and Ruback (2000) show that \nclaimholders\u2019 relative recoveries in Chapter 11 strongly depend on how disputes over the firm\u2019s \nvalue are resolved. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "18  Appendix 3 \nSALIENT POINTS ON BANK NEGARA MALAYSIA\u2019S \u201cGUIDELINES FOR THE SALE OF \nNPLs BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS\u201d \n \n1.
