Considering the diversity in \npolitical, socio economic and governance structures in ASEAN, it becomes imperative that \nexamining an organization that is critical to its nations\u2019 interests, provides insight into the \ninternal audit function in the public sector, and at the same time helps draw meaningful \ncomparisons across ASEAN Member States. Central bank for the purpose of this study is the \nmost appropriate institution. \nThe central bank holds a unique and important role in a nation\u2019s economy and its transactions \ncan only be performed by a public sector organization. It is also an institution that shares a \nsimilar mandate across countries and is based on a legal framework\u2014the Bank Act. The \ncentral bank is also expected to supervise the internal audit function of institutions under its \nsupervision, and as such can be expected to have a well-developed internal audit function \ncompared to other public sector organizations. \nTo measure the maturity and capability of the internal audit function in central banks, the \nstudy benchmarked the current capabilities of the function with the Internal Audit Capability \nModel (IA-CM) developed by The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). The IA-CM measures key \nprocess  areas  (KPAs)  on  five  capability  levels  and  six  elements  of  internal  auditing. \nInformation regarding the current capability of the internal audit function of the central banks \nwas gathered using a survey. The survey contained questions that covered the majority of the \nKPAs of the IA-CM and was based on the Global Internal Audit Survey of the IIA for 2010 and \n2015. \nThe results of the survey show that, while the services and role of the internal audit function is \nconsistently defined across the responding member states, significant variation exists among \nthe  states  in  regard  to  professional  practices,  people  management  and  performance \nmanagement.  The  remaining  two  elements\u2014governance  structures  and  organizational \nrelationships\u2014show slight variation among the responding member states. Key gaps observed \nwere the absence of audit committees, evolving risk management processes, the lack of risk-\nbased audit plans and external reviews of the internal audit function, and the emerging risk of \ninformation technology, which is expected to gain prominence over the next five years. \nAs public sector auditing is key to good public governance, ASEAN Member States need to take \nsteps to strengthen governance structures and professional practices, and ensure that internal \naudit functions are appropriately staffed to cope with the emerging risks faced by public sector \norganizations. ", " \n    1.  INTRODUCTION \nOver the last couple of decades, Asian countries have benefited from increased economic \ndevelopment and an improved standard of living. The modernization of financial management \nin the public sector has played a significant role in the economic development of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies and countries.  Moreover, modernization of \nfinancial management in the public sector has led to an increased focus on internal controls and \naudits (Sterck and Bouckaert, 2006). \n \nThis paper examines the maturity of the internal audit function in the public sector in ASEAN \nMember States by benchmarking the function with the Institute of Internal Auditors\u2019 Internal \nAudit  Capability  Model  (IA-CM)  for  the  public  sector.  Benchmarking  will  enable  us  to \nunderstand the current capabilities of the internal audit function and the steps needed to \nenhance its capabilities. To examine the maturity of internal audit in the public sector across \nASEAN Member States, it is important to define the public sector, understand the difference \nbetween external and internal audit, and study internal audit in an organization that helps us \ndDreafwin mitieoann ionfg tfhuel  cPoumbpliacr iSseocntso orn the state of internal audit across ASEAN Member States. \n \n  \n \nIn  general  terms,  the  public  sector  consists  of  government  and  all  publicly  controlled \n1\nenterprises, funded agencies and other entities that deliver public programs, goods or services.  \nHowever, it is not always easy to determine whether an organization should be considered part \nof the public sector. Hence, the study specified the criteria that help define the boundaries. To \ndefine the boundaries, the study turned to the definition employed by The Institute of Internal \n2\nAuditors (IIA).  The IIA defines the public sector as an expanding ring of organizations with the \ngovernment at its core, followed by agencies and public enterprises. Around this ring is a gray \nzone, businesses, which may or may not be part of the public sector. \n  - \nPub-li c sector organizations typically exist at the following levels: \n-  International \n-  National \nRegional \nLocal  \n \nIIA (2011) states that: \n \n\u201cAt  any  of  these  levels,  the  public  sector  generally  consists  of  at  least  three  types  of \norgan izaCtoiorne sg: overnment\no\n \n consists of a governing body with a defined territorial authority.

However, in most cases the government is the major shareholder, and \nthese  enterprises  partly  follow  the  acts  and  regulations  that  govern  the  core \ngovernment.\u201d \n \nHaving defined the three main types of organization that constitute the public sector, IIA (2011) \nclarifies this gray zone. This zone consists of two types of organizations that might or might not \nbe pa rt oStf athtee  pbuubsliinc essescetosr, . that government owned and controlled businesses that sell \no\n  goods or services for profit in the private market\u2026\u201d\n  Public contractors, tha atre \u201c\u2026\u201c\u2026legally independent entities outside government that \no\nreceive public funding to deliver public program s, goods, or services as their primary \nbusiness...\u201d   are \n \nDiagram of Public Sector Organizations \nCore \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: IIA: Supplemental guidance: Public Sector Definition \n \nStudying the maturity and capability of Internal Audit in the Public Sector is a daunting task. In \nhis study of the divergence in internal audit mechanisms, Jack Diamond (2002) observes that it \nis necessary to consider different audit traditions and different institutional capacities when \nintroducing measures to strengthen internal audit. Coupled with historical influences in the \naudit  structure,  evaluating  internal  audit  function  becomes  complex  and  selecting  the \nappropriate institution is significant and important. To overcome this challenge, the study \n3 \nidentified a common public sector organization to be a proxy for studying the capability and \n ", " \n   \nmaturity of internal audit in the public sector across ASEAN Member States. The identification \nof appropriate institution required that the study identify a common public sector entity that \nplays a key role in financial management, the economy, and the delivery of public services \norganization in ASEAN Member States. In addition, it should be core government or an agency, \nand have similar responsibilities and characteristics, which would make the organization or \nentity comparable across national boundaries. Considering the above requirements, central \nbanks therefore were the preferred choice to study the maturity of internal audit in the public \nsector across ASEAN Member States. \n \nThe paper is set out as follows: Section 2 is a literature review that covers central banks across \nthe ASEAN region, audit concepts, IA-CM model, and review of previous studies on Internal \nAudit, while Section 3 discusses the research methodology. The findings of the study are \npresented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. \n  2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n \nThis section focuses on three areas: (i) an overview and common features of central banks in \nthe ASEAN region; (ii) the evolution of the internal audit function, the difference between \nexternal and internal audit, and the development of the IA-CM model; and (iii) a review of \nprev ious studies on internal audit in the public sector both within and outside ASEAN. \n \n2.1Central Bank Overview  \nIn the previous section, the study specified the requirements for selecting a public sector \nenterprise for the study, and identified central banks as the most appropriate institution. This \nsection explains the rationale, discusses the characteristics and structure of central banks \nacross the ASEAN Member States, and explains why a central bank can only be a public sector \nenterprise and not a private commercial bank. \n \nThe central bank is a key feature of every major country in the world, and is the central arch of \n3\nthe financial and monetary system.  Central banks are charged with responsibility for managing \nthe monetary system, supervising the financial system, representing the national interest in \nrelations with multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank \nand regional development banks, facilitating efficient payment systems, and being bankers to \nthe government and commercial banks. Hence, central banks play an important and unique role \nin a country\u2019s economy. \n \nth\nAt the turn of the 20  century, the existence of central banks was limited. However, the number \nth\nof central banks grew rapidly in the second half of the 20  century, as countries abandoned the \ninternational  gold  standard,  which  had  provided  a  degree  of  automatic  control  over  the \ncountry\u2019s monetary system. In the absence of that automatic control, central banks are expected \nto provide discretionary control over monetary affairs. Goodhart (1991) states that, as banking \nsystems became larger, technical, and more complex, they have required closer and more \n4\neffective controls.  In addition, the importance of international relations and the spread of \nglobalization have required central banks to supervise the impact of these relations and deal \nwith any domestic disturbance that they may create. \n \nConsidering the importance of the central bank in a nation\u2019s economy, Oritani (2010) used an \ninstitutional economics approach to discuss the public governance of central banks. He argued \n t h  a   t     c  e  n   t r  a  l      b  a  n   k      g  o   v  e  r  n  a  n    ce  has  two  dimensions:  corporate  governance  and  public \n3\n Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

He also noted that the \nrecent literature on institutional economics sheds new light coenn ttrhael  pbuabnlkic,  bgeoivnegr naann ocreg oafn cizeanttiroanl  \nwbaitnhk sa.  pHueb laicp mplaiendd aWtei,l lbiaelmonsogns \u2019tso  tthheeo groyv eorf n\u201cmgoenvet rinn aan bcero aasd  isnetnesger, iatys \u201dd o(p trhoeb lietgyi)s ltaot ivthe,e e xinetceurtnivael  \namnadn jaugdeimciaenl tb roaf nccehnetsr, aal nbda nitk asc. tAsc icno rindtienrgp ltaoy  Owriittha ntih, etshee  g\u201co\u2026vernmental bodies within a country\u2019s \ngovernance structure\u2026\n\u201d. Similarly, one can use the IIA\u2019s definition of the public sector to classify \na central bank as a government agency, which exists as a separate organization but is part of \ngovernment and delivers public goods and services. \n \nWilliamson (1999) applied transaction cost economics to foreign affairs to analyze public sector \ntransactions and proposed \u201cgovernance as probity\u201d as a new category of governance structure. \nHe referred \u201cprobity\u201d to be the loyalty and rectitude with which a transaction is discharged. \nFurther, Williamson identified four attributes of a governance structure that are essential for \nmaintainin g probity: \n   \n(i)   Very low-powered incentives \n(ii)  Career staff with employment security \n(iii) Extensive administrative controls and procedures \n(iv) Appointment and termination of agency officers by the president and legislature \n \nWilliamson also identified six types of public sector transactions: procurement, redistribution, \nregulatory, sovereign, judicial, and infrastructure. Among the six, \u201csovereign transactions\u201d can \nbe conducted only by the public sector. \n \nOritani (2010) applied Williamson\u2019s theory to central banks and asserted that central bank \ntransactions are \u201csovereign transactions,\u201d and hence can be conducted only in the public sector \nand not in private organizations. Oritani examined the features of central bank transactions, \nwhich are conducted for the benefit of the country and not in pursuit of private profit. In \ngeneral,  a  central  bank  provides  three  types  of  service:  (i)  money  supply  management;              \n(ii) payment and settlement services; and (iii) financial system stability. Applying Williamson\u2019s \ntheory, Oritani classified two of the three services as sovereign transactions (management of \nmoney supply and financial system stability), and the third as a combination of infrastructure \nprobity  are  extremely  long  term,  self-\nand  sovereign  transactions  (payment  and  settlement  services).  In  his  probity  theory, \nrenewing and ongoing, and require loyalty to the leadership and to the mission and process \nWilliamson  asserted  that  transactions  requiring  \u201c\u2026\nintegrity\u2026\n\u201d. \n \nBased on the above features and probity hazards relating to central bank transactions, Oritani \nexamined the probity structure of a central bank transaction. \n \nMission \n \n  (Government/Legislature) \n \n  \nCommercial/Private  Central bank  Firms and Consumers \nBanks (Financial) \n \n \n \nSource: Oritani (2010) \n5 \n ", " \n   \n \nHe noted that the central bank does not have a direct relationship with the executive branch and \nenjoys a considerable degree of independence from both the executive and legislative branches. \nHence, Oritani concluded that central bank probity will be \u201c\u2026respect for the central bank \nmission\u2026\u201d and the mission is typically defined by the legislature. Oritani also stated that while a \ncentral bank is independent from the executive and legislative branches, it nevertheless has \nregular indirect contact with both the branches. Therefore, probity hazards in this case would \nbe, being disloyal to the mission, by not providing information faithfully to the executive and \nlegislative branches, thus creating a lack of trust with both branches. Such hazards would \nundermine the basic attributes necessary for conducting central bank transactions (Oritani, \n2010). \n \nLooking at the horizontal aspect, Oritani noted that counterparties of central bank transactions \nare basically financial institutions\u2014domestic as well as branches and subsidiaries of foreign \ninstitutions\u2014and  the  public.  The  direct  counterparties  of  monetary  policy  and  monetary \nprobity is required on the part of a central bank in dealing \noperations are the participants in financial markets, and indirect counterparties include firms \nwith such counterparties with some intended and necessary discretion. As for the counterparties of \nand the public. He further stated that \u201c\npayment and settlement services, they are financial institutions that have accounts with the \ncentral bank for interbank settlement services, and the public that uses cash or electronic modes of \npayment\n\u201d. Probity hazard in this case, consists in the words and actions of the central bank\u2019s \nofficials  and  staff  that  undermines  market  confidence  or  weakens  policy  credibility \n(Oritani,2010). \n \nWith respect to the third probity aspect, the internal aspect of a central bank, Oritani refers to \nthe integrity of central bank officials and staff toward the mission, their professional ability and \nprocess adequacy. According to Oritani, market participants will deem that the central bank \ndoes not have the appropriate authority not only if central bankers lose market confidence but \nalso if they lack probity vis-\u00e0-vis their mission. \n \nAfter explaining the features of central bank transactions and probity structure, Oritani applied \nthe  four  attributes  proposed  by  Williamson  to  central  banks.  He  noted  that  it  would  be \nimpossible  for  private  organizations  that  pursue  efficiency  and  net  profit  to  fulfil  such \nattributes. His comparison between central bank transactions and private bank transactions is \nprovided below. \nIncentive scheme  Staff  Management  Appointment of \n \nscheme  officers \n \nCentral bank  Relatively low  Intermediate  Intermediate level  Indirect \ntransactions  incentive  level of  of administrative  appointment by \nemployment  control  government, the \nA certain level of \nsecurity  legislature \nefficiency needed  Intermediate level \nMixture of  of hierarchical \nA certain level of \ncareer staff and  structure \nadventurousness \nmid-career \naccepted \npeople \n6 \n ", " \n \nIncentive scheme  Staff  Management  Appointment of \nscheme  officers \n \nPrivate bank  Strong incentive  Low  Low administrative  Independent from \ntransactions  scheme  employment  control  government, the \nsecurity  legislature \nEfficiency strongly  Flexible \npursued  Low perception  hierarchical \nof career staff  structure \nRegards \nadventurousness as \nentrepreneurship \nSource: Oritani (2010) \n \nHence, based on Williamson\u2019s theory of probity, Oritani concluded that a public organization can \nbest conduct central bank transactions.  Based on Oritani\u2019s approach and Goodhart\u2019s study of \nthe evolution of central banks, it can be deduced that central banks are public organizations that \nplay a unique and important role in a country\u2019s economy. \n \nCentral banks in the ASEAN region have been established through bank acts, which stipulate the \nroles and responsibilities of the central bank. In addition, the acts include regulations regarding \nthe appointment and dismissal of the bank\u2019s management. A detailed comparison of the acts of \nall ASEAN Member States for the establishment of the central bank is provided in Annex 1. The \ncommon features among these acts are summarized below. \nCommon Features of Central Banks in ASEAN \n \n \nCentral Ba nks across the ASEAN region are charged with the following responsibilities: \n   \n(i)   To determine and implement the monetary policy, \n(ii)  To act as the sole issuer of bank notes, and deliver an efficient payment system, \n(iii) To license, delicense and supervise financial institutions and banks, \n(iv) To manage foreign exchange reserves and maintain relations with international \nfinancial institutions like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Asian \nDevelopment Bank. \n \nThe  central  bank  is  an  independent  and  autonomous  institution  in  all  ASEAN  countries, \nalthough the governor and deputy governor of the bank are appointed by either the executive \nor legislatu re. The bank\u2019s board in all ASEAN states carries out the following activities: \n   \n(i) Establishes the policies for the operation of the central bank \n(ii)   Issues  decisions,  regulations,  circulars  and  other  directives  to  govern  the \n  business of the central bank \n(iii)  Establishes internal rules and regulations \n(iv) Establishes staff statutes \n(v) Establishes departments of the central bank \n \nIn some countries, the board carries out additional activities; nevertheless, the activities listed \nabove are performed by boards of all central banks in the ASEAN region. An audit requirement \nstated in all ASEAN countries\u2019 central bank acts is that the financial statements of central bank \na re to be audited by Supreme Audit Institutions and the report is to be presented to the \nexec utive and/or legislature as specified in the bank act. \n2.2Audit Concepts and the IA-CM Model \nIn this section, the study examined the brief evolution of internal audit as a function, the \n7 \ndifference between external and internal audit, and the IA-CM model. \n ", " \n   \n \nAn  audit  is  an  objective  evaluation  of  an  organization  or  entity\u2019s  financial  statements  to \nminimize the probability of occurrence of error, inefficient and uneconomic practices, and fraud. \nAudits are  of the following types: \n \n(i) Financial Audits: These cover the examination of and reporting on financial \n  statements  and  exam5ination  of  the  accounting  systems  upon  which  those \nstatements are based.  \n(ii) Compliance Audits: These examine legal and administrative compliance, the \n  propriety  of  administration,  financial  systems,  and  systems  of  management \ncontrol (footnote 5). \n(iii) Performance  Audits:  These  assess  the  management  and  operational \n \nperformance of programs and policies in meeting their objectives (footnote 5). \n \nThese audits can be carried out by external as well as internal auditors. Hence, in the context of \ntEhxet eprunbalilc a suedctiot r, it is imperative to distinguish between external and internal audits. \n  \nExternal audit is usually a statutory or legal requirement. It is carried out by an organization or \nperson who does not belong to the organization or entity being audited, following certain \n6\nstandards laid down by law or the profession.  External audit is not part of the organization or \nentity  and  there  is  no  reporting  relationship  between  the  management  or  board  of  the \norganization and external audit. The external audit institution generally presents its report to \ntIhnete gronvaelr anumdeint t or the national assembly. \n  \nan independent, objective assurance and consulting \nIanctteivrintya ld aeusdigint,e odn t toh aed odt hvearlu hea anndd,  iism pparrot voef  athne o irngtaenrnizaalt cioonn\u2019tsr oopl efrraamtioenwso. rItk  hoefl pans  aonr goarngiaznaitzioanti oonr  \neancctiotmy.p  lIisIAh  idtse foinbejesc tiinvteesr bnya lb aruindgiitn tgo a b sey s\u201ct\u2026ematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve \nthe  effectiveness  of  risk  management,  control,  and  governance  processes\u2026\n7\n\u201d.   The  reporting \nrelationship of internal audit in an organization or entity depends on the complexity and scale \nof the organization. Internal audit can report directly to the board audit committee of an \norganization or entity, or to its senior management. \n \nHistorically, internal auditing in its early years was perceived as a closely related extension of \nthe work of the external auditors. The internal auditors assisted the external auditors in \nfinancial statement reviews or performed an accounting related function such as banking \n \nreconciliations. With time, the concept of internal auditing has undergone significant changes \nregarding its definition, scope of coverage and approach, as is evident from The Institute of \nInternal Auditors\u2019 (IIA) definition of internal audit. \n \nInternal auditing emerged as a profession in 1941, when The IIA was founded in New York by a \ngroup of practicing internal auditors (footnote 7). Even though internal auditors worked in \ndifferent  businesses  and  professions,  the  need  for  a  common  body  of  knowledge  and \nstandardization  of  practices  was  then  recognized.  It  was  the  beginning  of  the  process of \nachieving an identity for internal audit as a distinct profession (footnote 7). \n                                                           \n \nSIGMA Papers\n5\n   OECD.

The IIA technical journal, Internal Auditor, was first distributed in 1943. \nThe Code of Ethics was issued in 1968, and in 1978 the IIA published the Standards for \nProfessional Practice to serve as the primary source of reference for directing an internal audit \nIfunntecrtinoanl  (Afouodtinto Ctea p8a).b ility Model (IA-CM) \n  \nThe nature of the internal audit organizational arrangements determines its independence and \neffectiveness.  \n   \nThe size and complexity of the public sector have influenced the diverse forms of internal audit \n9\norganizational arrangements and service delivery approaches. Diamond (2002) examined \ndifferent types of audit models prevalent in various countries and suggested that one may need \nto consider different audit traditions and institutional capacities when introducing measures to \nstrengthen internal audit in developing and transitional economies. He also suggested that, \nwhile international organizations issued international standards, there were concerns about \ntheir relevance to many developing and transitional economies. Considering the difficulties \nfaced in implementing internal audit standards in the public sector across different countries, \nthe Public Sector Committee, in 2004, recommended that an IA-CM be developed to reinforce \nthe importance of internal audit in public sector governance (footnote9).  \n \nThe Public Sector Committee identified the need for a universal model that public sector \ninternal audit could use as a self-assessment tool to assess their progress and development \nneeds (footnote 9). In September 2006, the Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation \n(IIARF) approved the project to develop a global model to help evolve public sector auditing. \nThe research team developing the model felt that global validation of the model was critical to \nits acceptability and usability. In partnership with the World Bank, IIARF worked to ensure \nsufficient global validation for the model, considering different forms of government, stages of \ngovernment maturity, and countries\u2019 culture (footnote 9). Concerns raised by Diamond (2002) \nabout the relevance of internal audit standards to many developing and transitional economies \nwere laid to rest by the development of the IA-CM model, which was globally validated and was \nnot based on the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d philosophy. \n \nThe IA-CM has five levels, shown in the figure below. Each capability level describes the \ncapability and characteristics of the internal audit activity at that level. As the complexity or \nsize of the organization increases, so does the sophistication of the activity, and the internal \naudit activity will be at a higher level (footnote 9). The capability model provides a roadmap for \ncontinuous  improvement  of  the  internal  audit  function.  However,  depending  on  the \norganization\u2019s nature and the environment in which it operates, the internal audit activity may \nchoose to remain at a particular level. In addition, one may need to assess the cost of moving \nfrom one level to another, and an internal audit activity may choose to stay at a particular level, \n \nas it may be cost effective at that point in time (footnote 9).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n8\n   Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).

He examined internal audit standards from an international perspective and \nnoted that a large number of countries would face severe problems of meeting such standards. \nDiamond discussed the main issues to be addressed in developing internal audit in developing \nand transitional economies and offered a framework for introducing internal audit reforms. He \npointed out that the overall design of the internal audit function should be geared to the specific \npriorities of a country. For countries with governance problems, the primary objective should \nbe to ensure compliance with financial laws and regulations, while for countries with a high \ndegree of financial stress, the macroeconomic objectives will be paramount. Diamond\u2019s main \nargument was that the same design for the internal audit function in the public sector cannot fit \nall countries. \n \nSullivan et al (2007) reviewed the tasks and design of audit committees in central banks. They \nargued  that  audit  committees  were  the  recommended  way  to  strengthen  financial \naccountability  and  central  bank  governance.  They  focused  on  the  functions  of  an  audit \ncommittee and concluded that the effectiveness of an audit committee\u2019s oversight of internal \ncontrols and financial disclosure may provide a strong safeguard against the emergence of \nreputational risk. They also stressed the importance of independence in the functioning of the \naudit committee and the qualification requirements to ensure that members on the committee \nare competent. \n \nThe Bank for International Settlements paper (BIS, 2012) on the internal audit function in \nbanks stresses the importance of the relationship between the supervisory body (i.e., the \ncentral bank) and the internal audit function of banks. The paper lays down the principle for \neffective  interaction  through  regular  communication  between  the  supervisory  body  and \ninternal  audit  function  of  banks  to  (i)  discuss  the  risk  areas  identified  by  both  parties,               \n11 \n(ii) understand the risk mitigation measures taken by the bank, and (iii) monitor the bank\u2019s \n ", " \n     \u201c\u2026in addition to meetings with senior \nmanagement, supervisory authorities should meet periodically with the bank\u2019s internal auditors \nrtoe sdpioscnusses  ttoh weire arkisnke sasneasl yidsiesn, tfiinfideidn. gIst,  fruerctohmerm setnatdeast itohnast ,and the audit plan\u2026\u201d\n. It also stresses \ntwo-way  communication  between  the  supervisory  authorities  and  the  internal  auditors, \nwhereby supervisory authorities may consider sharing information with the internal audit \nfunction, when  such information can increase the effectiveness of the function. Also, the \nsupervisory authority should make specific recommendations for strengthening the control \nenvironment and the internal audit function (BIS, 2012). The inherent implication of these \nprinciples  is  the  expectation  that  the  supervisory  authority  (i.e.,  the  central  bank)  will \nsupervise the internal audit function of the banks. To carry out this task effectively, the central \nbank will need to have a competent internal audit function in place, and this function will play \na key role in providing an independent commentary on the effectiveness of its own control \nenvironment. \n \nThe few completed studies on internal audit in the public sector for the ASEAN region do not \npresent a favorable picture. Ali et al (2007) studied internal audit in the state and local \ngovernment in Malaysia, and found that only 35 out of 202 state and local government bodies \nhad adequate internal audit capacity. They used the politics of accountability theory, power \ndistance, and a Malaysian social context to explain cases that display a lack of transparency and \npublic accountability from its actors, and predicted a bleak future for internal audit. They \nrecommended measures  such  as  an  increase  in  resource  allocation  to  the  internal  audit \nfunction  in  the  public  sector,  increased  authority  and  greater  responsibility  for  internal \nauditors, and a change in understanding among all civil servants of the role of internal audit. \nImplementation of such measures would be needed to improve the future for internal audit in \nMalaysia\u2019s public sector.  \n \nJunio-Sabio  (2013)  studied  the  state  of  internal  audit  in  selected  Philippine  government \nagencies. She found that the essential internal auditor roles are generally carried out in \naccordance with IIA standards. However, she noted the need to hone the competencies of \ngovernment internal auditors using engagement tools that include sampling and statistical \nanalysis. In Indonesia, Rahmatika (2014) studied the impact of the internal audit function\u2019s \neffectiveness on the quality of financial reporting in local government, and concluded that the \ninternal audit function has a positive effect on the quality of financial reporting. \n \nApart from these studies, no other significant studies appear to have been undertaken in the \nASEAN region. It can be seen from the review of ASEAN studies that every study had a different \nobjective; hence, it is difficult to draw any comparative conclusion on the state of internal audit \nin the public sector in ASEAN.  \n \nOutside ASEAN, internal audit has been studied more extensively, mostly in the United States, \nUnited Kingdom, Canada and Australia. In addition, key studies in Sudan, Israel, and South \nAfrica, countries similar to the studies in ASEAN, have focused on internal audit in the public \nsector. T\u2022h e Skuedya sntudies that have been undertaken are: \n \n: In their study of internal audit in the Sudanese public sector, Brierley et al \n(2001) noted that the internal audit function is engaged in routine transactions, is \nstaffed  by  inexperienced  and  untrained  personnel,  and  has  insufficient \nindependence or authority to function as an effective internal audit unit. They \nconcluded that the internal audit unit failed to meet even one of the five core \nstandards  of  the  IIA.  They  considered  the  country\u2019s  poor  economy,  political \n\u2022  iInsrsataelb:ility and corruption as the reasons for the bleak picture of the internal audit \nfunction. \n  Similarly, Schwartz and Sulitzeanu-Kenan (2002), in their study of internal \nauditing in the Israeli public sector, found that efforts to strengthen internal audit \n12 \nthrough the internal audit law did not lead to a significant change in the functioning \n ", " \n \nof the internal audit activity in most government agencies. They use the politics of \n\u2022  aSoccuothu nAtfarbiciali:t y theory to explain the reason for ineffective audit legislation and \nweak implementation.  \nRensburg and Coetzee (2016) studied the application of the IA-CM on \na  single  South  African  national  department  to  test  whether  the  model  was \nsuccessful in measuring internal audit capability. They chose the department with \nthe most effective internal audit function, as it had a better chance to be mature \nand applicable to the IA-CM. They concluded that the model was successful in \nmeasuring  the  internal  audit  capability  of  a  South  African  public  sector \norganization. They noted that, in some elements, the department appeared to have \nachieved a higher level, yet without fully achieving the KPA at the lower level. They \ntherefore contested that it may not always be possible to implement the IA-CM \nmodel in its current format within a global context, and recommended that IIARF \nshould clearly state that the model first be tested and adapted for a specific country \nor region prior to use. The conclusion on the usability of the IA-CM model is at odds \nwith the IIARF statement that the IA-CM has been globally validated and must be \nused  as  a  benchmark  tool  to  determine  current  capability  and  future \ndevelopmental needs. \n \nBased on the literature review (section 2.1 and 2.3), central banks satisfy the boundary \nconditions laid down in section 1. Central banks hold a unique and important role in a nation\u2019s \neconomy and their transactions can be performed only by a public sector organization. The \ncentral bank is also an institution that shares a mandate, which is similar across countries and \nis based on a legal framework\u2014the Bank Act. The central bank is also expected to supervise \nthe internal audit function of institutions under its supervision, and as such can be expected to \nhave a well-developed internal audit function. In fact, central banks can be expected to have \nthe most effective internal audit function among public sector organizations. \n \nThe study also reviewed different studies that measure the state of the internal audit function \nin public sector organizations. But as each study is unique, it becomes difficult to compare the \nstate of internal audit in the public sector across countries. However, the IA-CM developed by \nIIARF is a model that can be applied across countries and organizations of different size and \ncomplexity. Considering the diversity and different size and complexity of the countries in \nASEAN, The study applied the IA-CM model to the internal audit function of the central bank to \nunderstand the maturity of the internal audit function in the public sector across ASEAN \nMember States. \n  3.  METHODOLOGY \n \n \n3.1Research Method \nThe study aims to benchmark the current internal audit practices in the public sector of ASEAN \nMember States, using the central bank as the public sector institution for the study, with a view \nto understanding the current capabilities and maturity of the internal audit function. The study \ndoes not focus on measuring the effectiveness of the internal audit function\u2019s activities; instead, \nits main objective is to benchmark the current activities against the IA-CM and evaluate gaps, if \nany, between the current capabilities and the model.   \n \nA survey was undertaken as the primary research method to gather information. This method \nwas chosen as it facilitated the ease of information gathering, considering the cost and time \nconstraints of the study. Moreover, this method of data collection is useful as responses can \nbe converted into data that can be analyzed for the presence or absence of a condition or \nset of conditions linked to the KPAs in the IA-CM model. Secondary sources did not reveal \ninformation on the state of IA function in central banks, hence a survey questionnaire was \n13 \nthe best mean to collect the required information. The survey was based on IIA\u2019s 2010 and \n ", " \n   \n2015 Global Internal Audit Survey (GIAS). The first step was to identify the questions that would \nserve as measures for the KPA of the IA-CM. The questions, which were based on IA-CM KPAs, \nrequired the respondents to decide whether to agree with a statement regarding the existence \nof a certain condition or set of conditions. Though the questions were largely close-ended, they \nwere designed to provide a considerable degree of flexibility to the respondents. The survey \nwas  designed  to  capture  capability  levels  1-5,  though  for  certain  elements  the  questions \ncaptured capability levels 2-5, as at capability level 1 there are no repeatable and sustainable \ninternal audit processes. For some elements, capability level 5 has not been captured, as level 5 \nis an aspirational level for the element concerned. The survey questions are listed in Annex 2. \n \nThe respondents for the survey were the chief audit executives (CAEs) or heads of audit of the \ncentral banks of the ASEAN Member States. These were selected because the CAEs or heads of \naudit were in the best position to provide an objective and frank response to the survey, \nconsidering the time constraints and issue sensitivity of the study. \n \n3.2 Limitations \nAs the study aims to capture internal audit maturity in the public sector, using the central bank \nof each ASEAN country as the institution for the study, it is limited by the sample size. Moreover, \nas the data collection method is a survey, there can be an \u201cerror\u201d or \u201cbias\u201d in the study because \nof the respondents\u2019 interpretation of the survey questions. For contradictory responses by a \nrespondent  to  linked  questions  in  the  survey,  clarification  was  sought  through  phone \ninterviews. The response rate for the survey was 50%, i.e. only 5 of the 10 central banks \nresponded to the survey, despite conditions of anonymity. The reasons for not responding could \nbe (i) the perceived sensitivity of the issue being addressed in the study, and (ii) the CAEs\u2019 lack \nof time. As the response rate was 50%, a non-response bias may impact the findings of the \n11\nstudy.  \n \nAnother limitation is that IIA\u2019s 2010 Global Internal Audit survey does not cover all the KPAs of \nthe IA-CM. While the 2015 survey has additional questions, which cover KPAs that were missing \nin the 2010 survey, all the KPAs are still not covered. However, the study covers the majority of \nthe KPAs, which provides a good indication of the capability and maturity of the internal audit \nfunction in the public sector.  Any gaps from the benchmarking study, if addressed, would \nimprove the capabilities of the internal audit function. \n  4.  FINDINGS \n \nThis section presents the findings of the survey for the ASEAN region. The results, for ease of \ncomparison, are expressed as a percentage that reflects the proportion of respondents who \nagree with a certain statement or the existence of a certain condition or set of conditions. The \nresults have been categorized as per the six elements of internal auditing. The six elements \n12\nare:    \n   \n(i)   Services and Role of Internal Audit \n(ii)  People Management \n(iii)  Professional Practices \n(iv)  Performance Management and Accountability \n(v) Organizational Relationships and Culture \n               ( v   i )         G   o  v  e  r  n   a  n  c  e    S  t  r   uctures \n \n11\n A non-response bias is the error resulting from distinct differences between people who respond to a survey \nversus the people who do not respond.

Advisory services are typically consulting services provided by the \ninternal audit function and include training, system development reviews, counselling and \nadvice. The allocation of resources between advisory and assurance services depends on the \nobjective of the organization.  \n \nAll r\u2022e spondents indicated that they: \n \n\u2022  follow a systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, internal \ncontrols and governance processes; and \nprovide an internal control report on a regular basis, with 60% providing it annually \nand 40% on a periodic basis. \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n ", " \n People Management    \n \nPeople management deals with the creation of a work environment that enables people to \n13\nperform to the best of their abilities.

Often, internal  audit  reports \ndirected  to  elected  officials  can  be  detrimental  to  independence  of  the  function.  All \nrespondents believe that their function is independent and objective. The respondents also \nindicated that the CAE reports administratively to the board committee or its equivalent or to \nthe Chief Executive Officer or head of the governing body, which is a level 4 requirement. As \nregards functional reporting, the level 4 requirement is that the CAE reports to the board \ncommittee or its equivalent, which is the case for 60% of the respondents. All respondents also \nindicated that top management is involved in the selection of the CAE, which implies the \nsupport of senior management for internal audit activities. \n       DISCUSSION \n \n5.\nThe results of the survey reveal some differences among the internal audit functions in the \n21 \nASEAN region. While the services provided by the internal audit function, as well as its role, are \n ", " \n   \nconsistently  defined  across  the  member  states,  significant  variation  exists  regarding \nprofessional practices, people management and performance management. The remaining two \nelements\u2014governance structures and organizational relationships\u2014show a slight variation \namong the member states. Despite the differences, we have identified some common gaps and \nsAuugdgiets cteodm smteipttse tehsa t can be undertaken to bridge those gaps. \n  \nDiamond  (2002)  and  Sullivan  et  al  (2007)  have  discussed  the  importance  of  the  audit \ncommittee for ensuring effective governance and strengthening the role of the internal audit \nfunction. Respondents from ASEAN states where an audit committee exists have indicated that \nthe presence of the committee adds value to the internal audit activity. Considering 40% of the \nrespondents indicated the lack of an audit committee, this is a key gap in the ASEAN region. An \naudit committee helps to review the work of the function, identify important areas where \ncorrective  or  preventive  action  is  necessary,  and  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  audit \nrecommendations. Considering that central banks are expected to oversee the banking and \nfinancial system as well as the internal audit function of the entities it supervises, the lack of an \naudit committee in a central bank can cause a \u201cprobity\u201d hazard (Oritani, 2010). Absence of an \naudit committee may cause a \u201cprobity\u201d hazard in the internal aspect of a central bank, \nwhich as per Oritani (2010) refers to the integrity of central bank officials and staff toward \nthe  mission,  their  professional  ability  and  process  adequacy.  Sulivan  et  al  (2007)  also \nconcluded that effectiveness of audit committee\u2019s oversight on financial reporting and internal \ncontrols provides a strong safeguard against the emergence of reputation risk. The lack of an \naudit committee can also have an impact on the objectivity and independence of the internal \naudit function. The IIA standard 1100 requires the CAE to have unrestricted access to the \nboard. In addition, The IIA standard 1110 implies that full organizational independence is \nachieved when the CAE reports functionally to the board. Hence, countries that lack an audit \ncommittee should plug the gap by creating and implementing an audit committee charter. \nCountries can also use the legal framework\u2014an audit act\u2014 to mandate the formation of audit \nRcoimskm mitateneasg ienm peunbtli c sector organizations. \n  \nThe  internal  audit  function  is  expected  to  provide  assurance  on  an  organization\u2019s  risk \nmanagement processes, internal controls, and governance processes, and is expected to work \nclosely with the organization\u2019s risk management function. However, under no circumstance is \nthe internal audit function expected to perform management tasks, as its prime responsibility \nis  to  provide  independent  assurance  over  financial  controls  and  the  risk  management \nprocesses. The results of the survey showed that 40% of the respondents had indicated that \nrisk management processes are evolving, and internal audit is expected to be the second line of \ndefense, or that the three line of defense model does not exist. Considering that risks in the \npublic sector go beyond financial and operational risk and can include societal and political \nrisk, it is imperative that organizations have a risk management function in place. If central \nbanks, which control the monetary policy as well as act as bankers to the government and \nother commercial banks, do not have an enterprise risk management framework in place or \nare in the process of developing risk management processes, it can be implied that central \nbank may not have a proper view of the risk faced by the institution. Considering the \nunique position of the central bank in a country\u2019s economy, the lack of adequate risk \nmanagement processes or framework may also give rise to probity hazards in central \nbank transactions. In comparison, it is common practice in the private sector to have a risk \nmanagement committee to provide oversight of the risks faced by the organization as well as \nto direct the risk management function. Similarly, efforts should be made to strengthen the \nenterprise  risk  management  program  and  processes  and  institute  risk  management \ncommittees to oversee the risk management function in the central bank(s) of responding \n22 \nASEAN Member States that currently lack risk management capabilities. \n ", " \nRisk-based audit plans   \n \nA significant proportion of the respondents indicated that they do not use risk-based audit \nplans, but prepare their audit plans based on management/stakeholder priorities. Building \naudit plans on management/stakeholder priorities is relevant when the internal audit function \nis at level 2, per the IA-CM. However, to make the audit function more objective, it needs to \nfactor in risk-based audit plans. Basing the audit strategy and audit plans on risk exposure and \nthe likelihood of losses ensures that the internal audit function understands the organization\u2019s \nmain risks, and contributes to management\u2019s mitigation of them, thereby improving the overall \nrisk profile of the organization. Moreover, the internal audit function through its own risk \nassessment can triangulate on the risk management infrastructure to refine its annual audit \nplan. Once determines, the plan can be used to determine the resource strategy for the internal \naudit  function.  Considering  that  risk  management  procedures  are  evolving  and  audit \ncommittees do not exist in certain countries, it is not surprising that the internal audit function \ndoes not use risk-based audit plans. The issue could be addressed by putting in place  a risk \nmanagement committee and adopting the three lines of defense model, with an established \nEenxtteerrpnraisl er erivsike wm aannadg eqmuaelnitt yfr aasmseuwraonrkce.   program \n  \nAn external review of an internal audit function helps to identify and correct substandard \npractices, and check whether internal auditors are fulfilling their mandate and observing \ninternational standards (Diamond, 2002). The lack of a quality assurance program and an \nexternal review can result in sub-optimal performance of the internal audit function, and may \ngive rise to a probity hazard in the internal practice of the function (Oritani, 2010). \nMoreover,  the  Bank  for  International  Settlement  (BIS,  2012)  stressed  a  two-way \ncommunication between the supervisory board and the internal audit function of the \ninstitution it supervises. Authorities may consider sharing information that raises the \neffectiveness of the internal audit function of the supervised institution. The inherent \nimplication  of  the  principles  outlined  in  the  BIS  paper  is  the  expectation  that  the \nsupervisor body (i.e., central banks) will supervise the internal audit function of the \nbanks, which implied central banks need to have a competent internal audit function. An \nexternal  review  and  quality  assurance  program  help  the  institution  to  measure  the \neffectiveness and competency of the internal audit function. Moreover, The IIA Standard \n1310 requires the quality assurance and improvement program to include internal and \nexternal assessments. Further The IIA Standard 1311 states that internal assessments \nmust include ongoing performance with the internal audit activity and periodic reviews \nperformed through self-assessment or by other person within the organization with \nsufficient knowledge of internal audit practices. These gaps can be addressed by putting in \nplace a quality assurance program and including the need to conduct a periodic external \nreview through amendment to national audit acts for the public sector. Audit committees can \nalso  address  the  gap  by  reviewing  the  quality  assurance  and  external  assessment \npStraofgf rraemso oufr tchees  ifnotre irnnfaolr amuadtitio fnun tcetcihonno. logy audits \n  \nEmerging threats, specifically information technology threats, require public sector agencies \nto upgrade the knowledge and information technology auditing ability of their internal audit \nfunction. A significant proportion of the respondents in the study have indicated that they will \nbe expected to undertake an increasing number of technology audits. This will require the \ninternal audit function to attract staff from within the organization or from the labor market. \nThe respondents indicated that it is easier to attract resources from the external market than \ninternally; this is a cause for concern. While central banks may find it easier to attract \n23 \n ", " \n   \nresources, studies have shown that it is difficult for public sector organizations to attract \ntalent.  Attributes  of  a  governance  structure  for  maintaining  probity  such  as  extensive \nprocedures for hiring and low powered incentives may affect hiring resources for technology \nauditors. Hence, efforts should be made to create programs and incentives to attract staff \nfrom within the organization. This would require the CAE to influence stakeholders as well as \npromote the value of internal audit within the organization. Alternatively, due to the fast \nevolving nature of information systems, central banks and public sector organizations \ncould look at the option of engaging external experts and develop in-house expertise to \ncarry out information technology audits. \nBudget and tracking of costs \n  \nThe  ability  to  measure  the  performance  of  the  internal  audit  function  can  also  help  in \nnegotiating audit budgets and obtain the resources needed to carry out activities as per the \naudit plan. Currently, only 20% of the survey respondents provide cost information, which \nmeant the majority might not have aligned budget to actual audit hours. Tracking actual cost \nand providing cost information to stakeholders could improve the performance management \nof internal audit function. Cost tracking can help gain additional funding to attract the right \ntalent  or  develop  the  IA  function\u2019s  internal  infrastructure  for  better monitoring  of  audit \nprocedures. \n \nThe academic study examined the maturity of internal audit function in the public sector \nin ASEAN using central banks as proxy for the research where the internal audit maturity \nof selected central banks was benchmarked against the IA-CM developed by The IIA. \nRecognizing fully the study was an initial effort to examine internal audit maturity in the \npublic sector in ASEAN within a constrained time frame, it has certain limitations such as \nsmall sample size and non-response bias. The study showed that the role and services of \ninternal audit function have been consistent among the respondent central banks; the \nfunction is independent and objective; and the involvement of political bias did not arise \nin the study. Nevertheless, the study highlighted certain opportunities that could improve \nfurther the capability of internal audit function. The opportunities centers on governance \nstructures  and  professional  practices  by  strengthening  enterprise  risk  management \nframework;  establishing  audit  committees  where  none  exist;  reinforcing  external \nassessment and quality assurance programs; and establishing means to cope with new \nand emerging risks such as information technology. \n \nFuture academic studies can be undertaken with alternative public sector organizations \nwith  similar  characteristics  in  ASEAN  by  comparing  the  maturity  of  internal  audit \nfunction with central banks. Also, comparative studies contrasting the internal function \nin central banks outside ASEAN could be an interesting research. In conclusion, there are \nmany factors or public sector agencies that impact internal audit function, however with \nincreased focus on financial management in the public sector as well as the private \nsector, the study chose an institution, central banks, that plays a critical role in the \ncountry\u2019s economy and supervises the financial stability and money flow of the economy, \nto gain further insight on the maturity of the internal audit function in the public sector in \nASEAN. \n24 \n ", " \n \nBibliography \n \n \nChapter1: Internal Auditing History,Evolution and Prospects.\n(IIA), I. o.
