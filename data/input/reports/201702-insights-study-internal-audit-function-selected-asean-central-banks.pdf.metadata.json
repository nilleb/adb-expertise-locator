Considering  the  diversity  in \npolitical,  socio  economic  and  governance  structures  in  ASEAN,  it  becomes  imperative  that \nexamining  an  organization  that  is  critical  to  its  nations\u2019  interests,  provides  insight  into  the \ninternal  audit  function  in  the  public  sector,  and  at  the  same  time  helps  draw  meaningful \ncomparisons  across  ASEAN  Member  States.  Central  bank  for  the  purpose  of  this  study  is  the \nmost appropriate institution. \n\nThe central bank holds a unique and important role in a nation\u2019s economy and its transactions \ncan  only  be  performed  by  a  public  sector  organization.  It  is  also  an  institution  that  shares  a \nsimilar  mandate  across  countries  and  is  based  on  a  legal  framework\u2014the  Bank  Act.  The \ncentral bank is also expected to supervise the internal audit function of institutions under its \nsupervision,  and  as  such  can  be  expected  to  have  a  well-developed  internal  audit  function \ncompared to other public sector organizations. \n\nTo  measure  the  maturity  and  capability  of  the  internal  audit  function  in  central  banks,  the \nstudy benchmarked the current capabilities of the function with the Internal Audit Capability \nModel (IA-CM) developed by The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). The IA-CM measures key \nprocess  areas  (KPAs)  on  five  capability  levels  and  six  elements  of  internal  auditing. \nInformation regarding the current capability of the internal audit function of the central banks \nwas gathered using a survey. The survey contained questions that covered the majority of the \nKPAs of the IA-CM and was based on the Global Internal Audit Survey of the IIA for 2010 and \n2015. \n\nThe results of the survey show that, while the services and role of the internal audit function is \nconsistently defined across the responding member states, significant variation exists among \nthe  states  in  regard  to  professional  practices,  people  management  and  performance \nmanagement.  The  remaining  two  elements\u2014governance  structures  and  organizational \nrelationships\u2014show slight variation among the responding member states. Key gaps observed \nwere the absence of audit committees, evolving risk management processes, the lack of risk-\nbased audit plans and external reviews of the internal audit function, and the emerging risk of \ninformation technology, which is expected to gain prominence over the next five years. \n\nAs public sector auditing is key to good public governance, ASEAN Member States need to take \nsteps to strengthen governance structures and professional practices, and ensure that internal \naudit functions are appropriately staffed to cope with the emerging risks faced by public sector \norganizations. \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nOver  the  last  couple  of  decades,  Asian  countries  have  benefited  from  increased  economic \ndevelopment and an improved standard of living. The modernization of financial management \nin the public sector has played a significant role in the economic development of the Association \nof  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  economies  and  countries.    Moreover,  modernization  of \nfinancial management in the public sector has led to an increased focus on internal controls and \naudits (Sterck and Bouckaert, 2006). \n \nThis paper examines the maturity of the internal audit function in the public sector in ASEAN \nMember  States  by  benchmarking  the  function  with  the  Institute  of  Internal  Auditors\u2019  Internal \nAudit  Capability  Model  (IA-CM)  for  the  public  sector.  Benchmarking  will  enable  us  to \nunderstand  the  current  capabilities  of  the  internal  audit  function  and  the  steps  needed  to \nenhance  its  capabilities.  To  examine  the  maturity  of  internal  audit  in  the  public  sector  across \nASEAN  Member  States,  it  is  important  to  define  the  public  sector,  understand  the  difference \nbetween  external  and internal  audit,  and study internal  audit in  an organization  that helps us \ndraw meaningful comparisons on the state of internal audit across ASEAN Member States. \nDefinition of the Public Sector\n \n\n  \n\n \nIn  general  terms,  the  public  sector  consists  of  government  and  all  publicly  controlled \n1\n \nenterprises, funded agencies and other entities that deliver public programs, goods or services.\nHowever, it is not always easy to determine whether an organization should be considered part \nof the public sector. Hence, the study specified the criteria that help define the boundaries. To \ndefine the boundaries, the study turned to the definition employed by The Institute of Internal \n2\n The IIA defines the public sector as an expanding ring of organizations with the \nAuditors (IIA).\ngovernment at its core, followed by agencies and public enterprises. Around this ring is a gray \nzone, businesses, which may or may not be part of the public sector. \n \nPublic sector organizations typically exist at the following levels: \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nInternational \nNational \nRegional \nLocal  \n\n \nIIA (2011) states that: \n \n\u201cAt  any  of  these  levels,  the  public  sector  generally  consists  of  at  least  three  types  of \norganizations: \n \n\no  Core government\n\n consists of a governing body with a defined territorial authority. Core \ngovernments  include  all  departments,  ministries,  or  branches  of  the  government  that \nare  integral  parts  of  the  structure,  and  are  accountable  to  and  report  directly  to  the \ncentral authority\u2014the legislature, council, cabinet, or executive head. \n\no  Agencies \n\nconsist of public organizations that are clearly a part of the government and \ndeliver  public  programs, goods, or  services,  but  that  exist  as separate  organizations in \ntheir  own  right\u2014possibly  as  legal  entities\u2014and  operate  with  a  partial  degree  of \noperational  independence.  They  often,  but  not  necessarily,  are  headed  by  a  board  of \ndirectors, commission, or other appointed body. \n\no  Public  enterprises\n\n  are  agencies  that  deliver  public  programs,  goods,  or  services,  but \noperate  independently  of  government  and  have  their  own  sources  of  revenue  in \naddition  to  direct  public  funding.  They  also  may  compete  in  private  markets  and  may \n\n                                                           \n\nSupplemental Guidance : Public Sector Definition.\n\n IIA.

This zone consists of two types of organizations that might or might not \nbe part of the public sector. \ngovernment  owned  and  controlled  businesses  that  sell \n \n\no  State  businesses,  that\n\ngoods or services for profit in the private market\u2026\u201d\n\no  Public  contractors,  that\n\n\u201c\u2026legally  independent  entities  outside  government  that \nreceive  public  funding  to  deliver  public  programs,  goods,  or  services  as  their  primary \nbusiness...\u201d \n \n\n  are \n\n \n\n  are  \u201c\u2026\n\nDiagram of Public Sector Organizations \n\nCore \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSource: IIA: Supplemental guidance: Public Sector Definition \n\n \nStudying the maturity and capability of Internal Audit in the Public Sector is a daunting task. In \nhis study of the divergence in internal audit mechanisms, Jack Diamond (2002) observes that it \nis  necessary  to  consider  different  audit  traditions  and  different  institutional  capacities  when \nintroducing  measures  to  strengthen  internal  audit.  Coupled  with  historical  influences  in  the \naudit  structure,  evaluating  internal  audit  function  becomes  complex  and  selecting  the \nappropriate  institution  is  significant  and  important.  To  overcome  this  challenge,  the  study \n3 \nidentified  a  common  public  sector  organization  to  be  a  proxy  for  studying  the  capability  and \n \n\n\f \n\nmaturity of internal audit in the public sector across ASEAN Member States. The identification \nof  appropriate institution  required  that  the study  identify  a  common  public  sector  entity  that \nplays  a  key  role  in  financial  management,  the  economy,  and  the  delivery  of  public  services \norganization in ASEAN Member States. In addition, it should be core government or an agency, \nand  have  similar  responsibilities  and  characteristics,  which  would  make  the  organization  or \nentity  comparable  across  national  boundaries.  Considering  the  above  requirements,  central \nbanks therefore were the preferred choice to study the maturity of internal audit in the public \nsector across ASEAN Member States. \n \nThe paper is set out as follows: Section 2 is a literature review that covers central banks across \nthe ASEAN region, audit concepts, IA-CM model, and review of previous studies on Internal \nAudit,  while  Section  3  discusses  the  research  methodology.  The  findings  of  the  study  are \npresented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. \n \n \n\n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nThis section  focuses  on  three  areas:  (i)  an overview  and  common  features of  central  banks in \nthe  ASEAN  region;  (ii)  the  evolution  of  the  internal  audit  function,  the  difference  between \nexternal  and  internal  audit,  and  the  development  of  the  IA-CM  model;  and  (iii)  a  review  of \nprevious studies on internal audit in the public sector both within and outside ASEAN. \n \n\n \n\nCentral Bank Overview  \n\n2.1\nIn  the  previous  section,  the  study  specified  the  requirements  for  selecting  a  public  sector \nenterprise for the study, and identified central banks as the most appropriate institution. This \nsection  explains  the  rationale,  discusses  the  characteristics  and  structure  of  central  banks \nacross the ASEAN Member States, and explains why a central bank can only be a public sector \nenterprise and not a private commercial bank. \n \nThe central bank is a key feature of every major country in the world, and is the central arch of \n3\n Central banks are charged with responsibility for managing \nthe financial and monetary system.\nthe  monetary  system,  supervising  the  financial  system,  representing  the  national  interest  in \nrelations with multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank \nand  regional  development  banks,  facilitating  efficient  payment  systems,  and  being  bankers  to \nthe government and commercial banks. Hence, central banks play an important and unique role \nin a country\u2019s economy. \n \n century, the existence of central banks was limited. However, the number \nAt the turn of the 20\nth\nof central banks grew rapidly in the second half of the 20\n century, as countries abandoned the \ninternational  gold  standard,  which  had  provided  a  degree  of  automatic  control  over  the \ncountry\u2019s monetary system. In the absence of that automatic control, central banks are expected \nto provide discretionary control over monetary affairs. Goodhart (1991) states that, as banking \nsystems  became  larger,  technical,  and  more  complex,  they  have  required  closer  and  more \n4\n  In  addition,  the  importance  of  international  relations  and  the  spread  of \neffective  controls.\nglobalization  have  required  central  banks  to  supervise  the  impact  of  these  relations  and  deal \nwith any domestic disturbance that they may create. \n \nConsidering the importance of the central bank in a nation\u2019s economy, Oritani (2010) used an \ninstitutional economics approach to discuss the public governance of central banks. He argued \nthat  central  bank  governance  has  two  dimensions:  corporate  governance  and  public \n                                                           \n\nth\n\n Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

Public  governance  is  an  institutional  framework  whereby  the  public  governs  a \ncentral  bank  through  the  country\u2019s  legislative  and  executive  bodies.  He  also  noted  that  the \nrecent literature on institutional economics sheds new light on the public governance of central \ncentral  bank,  being  an  organization \nbanks.  He  applied  Williamson\u2019s  theory  of  \u201cgovernance  as  integrity\u201d  (probity)  to  the  internal \nwith a public mandate, belongs to the government in a broad sense, as do the legislative, executive \nmanagement  of central  banks.  According  to  Oritani,  the \u201c\u2026\nand judicial branches, and it acts in interplay with these governmental bodies within a country\u2019s \ngovernance structure\u2026\n\n\u201d. Similarly, one can use the IIA\u2019s definition of the public sector to classify \na  central  bank  as  a  government  agency,  which  exists  as  a  separate  organization  but  is  part of \ngovernment and delivers public goods and services. \n \nWilliamson (1999) applied transaction cost economics to foreign affairs to analyze public sector \ntransactions and proposed \u201cgovernance as probity\u201d as a new category of governance structure. \nHe referred \u201cprobity\u201d to be the loyalty and rectitude with which a transaction is discharged. \nFurther, Williamson identified four attributes of a governance structure that are essential for \nmaintaining probity: \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n(ii)\n \n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nVery low-powered incentives \nCareer staff with employment security \nExtensive administrative controls and procedures \nAppointment and termination of agency officers by the president and legislature \n\n \nWilliamson also identified six types of public sector transactions: procurement, redistribution, \nregulatory, sovereign,  judicial,  and infrastructure. Among  the six, \u201csovereign  transactions\u201d can \nbe conducted only by the public sector. \n \nOritani  (2010)  applied  Williamson\u2019s  theory  to  central  banks  and  asserted  that  central  bank \ntransactions are \u201csovereign transactions,\u201d and hence can be conducted only in the public sector \nand  not  in  private  organizations.  Oritani  examined  the  features  of  central  bank  transactions, \nwhich  are  conducted  for  the  benefit  of  the  country  and  not  in  pursuit  of  private  profit.  In \ngeneral,  a  central  bank  provides  three  types  of  service:  (i)  money  supply  management;              \n(ii) payment and settlement services; and (iii) financial system stability. Applying Williamson\u2019s \ntheory,  Oritani  classified  two  of  the  three  services  as  sovereign  transactions  (management  of \nmoney supply and financial system stability), and the third as a combination of infrastructure \nprobity  are  extremely  long  term,  self-\nand  sovereign  transactions  (payment  and  settlement  services).  In  his  probity  theory, \nrenewing  and  ongoing,  and  require  loyalty  to  the  leadership  and  to  the  mission  and  process \nWilliamson  asserted  that  transactions  requiring  \u201c\u2026\nintegrity\u2026\n\n\u201d. \n\n \nBased on the above features and probity hazards relating to central bank transactions, Oritani \nexamined the probity structure of a central bank transaction. \n \n \n \n\nMission \n\n(Government/Legislature) \n\nCommercial/Private \nBanks (Financial) \n\n \n\nSource: Oritani (2010) \n\n5 \n\nCentral bank \n\nFirms and Consumers \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nHe noted that the central bank does not have a direct relationship with the executive branch and \nenjoys a considerable degree of independence from both the executive and legislative branches. \nHence,  Oritani  concluded  that  central  bank  probity  will  be  \u201c\u2026respect  for  the  central  bank \nmission\u2026\u201d and the mission is typically defined by the legislature. Oritani also stated that while a \ncentral  bank  is  independent  from  the  executive  and  legislative  branches,  it  nevertheless  has \nregular indirect contact with both the branches. Therefore, probity hazards in this case would \nbe,  being  disloyal  to  the  mission,  by  not  providing  information  faithfully  to  the  executive  and \nlegislative  branches,  thus  creating  a  lack  of  trust  with  both  branches.  Such  hazards  would \nundermine  the  basic  attributes  necessary  for  conducting  central  bank  transactions  (Oritani, \n2010). \n \nLooking at the horizontal aspect, Oritani noted that counterparties of central bank transactions \nare  basically  financial  institutions\u2014domestic  as  well  as  branches  and  subsidiaries  of  foreign \ninstitutions\u2014and  the  public.  The  direct  counterparties  of  monetary  policy  and  monetary \nprobity is required on the part of a central bank in dealing \noperations  are  the  participants  in  financial markets,  and  indirect  counterparties include  firms \nwith such counterparties with some intended and necessary discretion. As for the counterparties of \nand the public. He further stated that \u201c\npayment  and  settlement  services,  they  are  financial  institutions  that  have  accounts  with  the \ncentral bank for interbank settlement services, and the public that uses cash or electronic modes of \npayment\n\n\u201d.  Probity  hazard  in  this  case,  consists  in  the  words  and  actions  of  the  central  bank\u2019s \nofficials  and  staff  that  undermines  market  confidence  or  weakens  policy  credibility \n(Oritani,2010). \n \nWith respect to the third probity aspect, the internal aspect of a central bank, Oritani refers to \nthe integrity of central bank officials and staff toward the mission, their professional ability and \nprocess  adequacy.  According  to  Oritani,  market  participants  will  deem  that  the  central  bank \ndoes not have the appropriate authority not only if central bankers lose market confidence but \nalso if they lack probity vis-\u00e0-vis their mission. \n \nAfter explaining the features of central bank transactions and probity structure, Oritani applied \nthe  four  attributes  proposed  by  Williamson  to  central  banks.  He  noted  that  it  would  be \nimpossible  for  private  organizations  that  pursue  efficiency  and  net  profit  to  fulfil  such \nattributes. His comparison between central bank transactions and private bank transactions is \nprovided below. \n \n\nIncentive scheme \n\nStaff \n\nAppointment of \nofficers \n\nManagement \nscheme \n\n \n\nCentral bank \ntransactions \n\nRelatively low \nincentive \n\nA  certain  level  of \nefficiency needed \n\nA  certain  level  of \nadventurousness \naccepted \n\nIntermediate level \nof administrative \ncontrol \n\nIntermediate level \nof hierarchical \nstructure \n\nIndirect \nappointment by \ngovernment, the \nlegislature \n\nIntermediate \nlevel of \nemployment \nsecurity \n\nMixture of \ncareer staff and \nmid-career \npeople \n\n6 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPrivate bank \ntransactions \n\nStrong incentive \nscheme \n\nEfficiency strongly \npursued \n\nRegards \nadventurousness as \nentrepreneurship \n\nSource: Oritani (2010) \n\nIncentive scheme \n\nStaff \n\nManagement \nscheme \n\nAppointment of \nofficers \n\n \n\nLow administrative \ncontrol \n\nIndependent from \ngovernment, the \nlegislature \n\nLow \nemployment \nsecurity \n\nLow perception \nof career staff \n\nFlexible \nhierarchical \nstructure \n\n \nHence, based on Williamson\u2019s theory of probity, Oritani concluded that a public organization can \nbest  conduct  central  bank  transactions.    Based  on  Oritani\u2019s  approach  and  Goodhart\u2019s  study  of \nthe evolution of central banks, it can be deduced that central banks are public organizations that \nplay a unique and important role in a country\u2019s economy. \n \nCentral banks in the ASEAN region have been established through bank acts, which stipulate the \nroles and responsibilities of the central bank. In addition, the acts include regulations regarding \nthe appointment and dismissal of the bank\u2019s management. A detailed comparison of the acts of \nall ASEAN Member States for the establishment of the central bank is provided in Annex 1. The \ncommon features among these acts are summarized below. \nCommon Features of Central Banks in ASEAN \n \n \n\nCentral Banks across the ASEAN region are charged with the following responsibilities: \n \n\n \n\n \n(i)\n \n(ii)\n \n(iii)\n(iv)\n\n \n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\n \n \n(iii)\n \n(iv)\n(v)\n\nTo determine and implement the monetary policy, \nTo act as the sole issuer of bank notes, and deliver an efficient payment system, \nTo license, delicense and supervise financial institutions and banks, \nTo manage foreign exchange reserves and maintain relations with international \nfinancial  institutions  like  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  World  Bank,  Asian \nDevelopment Bank. \n\n \nThe  central  bank  is  an  independent  and  autonomous  institution  in  all  ASEAN  countries, \nalthough the governor and deputy governor of the bank are appointed by either the executive \nor legislature.

Hence, in the context of \nthe public sector, it is imperative to distinguish between external and internal audits. \nExternal audit \n \n \n\nExternal audit is usually a statutory or legal requirement. It is carried out by an organization or \nperson  who  does  not  belong  to  the  organization  or  entity  being  audited,  following  certain \n6\n External audit is not part of the organization or \nstandards laid down by law or the profession.\nentity  and  there  is  no  reporting  relationship  between  the  management  or  board  of  the \norganization and external audit. The external audit institution generally presents its report to \nthe government or the national assembly. \nInternal audit \n \n \n\nan  independent,  objective  assurance  and  consulting \nInternal audit, on the other hand, is part of the internal control framework of an organization or \nactivity designed to add value and improve an organization\u2019s operations. It helps an organization \nentity.    IIA  defines  internal  audit  to  be  \u201c\u2026\naccomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve \nthe  effectiveness  of  risk  management,  control,  and  governance  processes\u2026\n\n \n\n\u201d.\n\n7\n  The  reporting \nrelationship of internal audit in an organization or entity depends on the complexity and scale \nof  the  organization.  Internal  audit  can  report  directly  to  the  board  audit  committee  of  an \norganization or entity, or to its senior management. \n \nHistorically, internal auditing in its early years was perceived as a closely related extension of \nthe  work  of  the  external  auditors.  The  internal  auditors  assisted  the  external  auditors  in \nfinancial  statement  reviews  or  performed  an  accounting  related  function  such  as  banking \n With time, the concept of internal auditing has undergone significant changes \nreconciliations.\nregarding  its  definition,  scope  of  coverage  and  approach,  as  is  evident  from  The  Institute  of \nInternal Auditors\u2019 (IIA) definition of internal audit. \n \nInternal auditing emerged as a profession in 1941, when The IIA was founded in New York by a \ngroup  of  practicing  internal  auditors  (footnote  7).  Even  though  internal  auditors  worked  in \ndifferent  businesses  and  professions,  the  need  for  a  common  body  of  knowledge  and \nstandardization  of  practices  was  then  recognized.  It  was  the  beginning  of  the  process  of \nachieving an identity for internal audit as a distinct profession (footnote 7). \n                                                           \n \n\nSIGMA Papers\n\n   OECD.

He  also  suggested  that, \nwhile  international  organizations  issued  international  standards,  there  were  concerns  about \ntheir  relevance  to  many  developing  and  transitional  economies.  Considering  the  difficulties \nfaced in implementing internal audit standards in the public sector across different countries, \nthe Public Sector Committee, in 2004, recommended that an IA-CM be developed to reinforce \nthe importance of internal audit in public sector governance (footnote9).  \n \nThe  Public  Sector  Committee  identified  the  need  for  a  universal  model  that  public  sector \ninternal  audit  could  use  as  a  self-assessment  tool  to  assess  their  progress  and  development \nneeds (footnote 9). In September 2006, the Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation \n(IIARF) approved the project to develop a global model to help evolve public sector auditing. \nThe research team developing the model felt that global validation of the model was critical to \nits  acceptability  and  usability.  In  partnership  with  the  World  Bank,  IIARF  worked  to  ensure \nsufficient global validation for the model, considering different forms of government, stages of \ngovernment maturity, and countries\u2019 culture (footnote 9). Concerns raised by Diamond (2002) \nabout the relevance of internal audit standards to many developing and transitional economies \nwere laid to rest by the development of the IA-CM model, which was globally validated and was \nnot based on the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d philosophy. \n \nThe  IA-CM  has  five  levels,  shown  in  the  figure  below.  Each  capability  level  describes  the \ncapability  and  characteristics  of  the  internal  audit  activity  at  that  level.  As  the  complexity  or \nsize  of  the  organization  increases,  so  does  the  sophistication  of  the  activity,  and  the  internal \naudit activity will be at a higher level (footnote 9). The capability model provides a roadmap for \ncontinuous  improvement  of  the  internal  audit  function.  However,  depending  on  the \norganization\u2019s nature and the environment in which it operates, the internal audit activity may \nchoose to remain at a particular level. In addition, one may need to assess the cost of moving \nfrom one level to another, and an internal audit activity may choose to stay at a particular level, \n \nas it may be cost effective at that point in time (footnote 9).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n\n   Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).

The KPAs at each capability level are the main \nbuilding  blocks  to  determine  the  capability  level  of  the  internal  audit  activity.  For  each  KPA \nthere are essential activities that need to be carried out to achieve the short-term outputs, \nand  the  long  term  outcomes  are  expected  when  a  KPA  has  been  mastered  and \ninstitutionalized  in  the  culture  of  the  organization.  When  the  internal  audit  activity  has \ninstitutionalized  all  KPAs  associated  with  a  given  capability  level,  it  is  considered  that  the \nactivity  has  achieved  that  level  (footnote 10). KPAs  at  each  level  and  element  build upon  one \nanother and establish the foundation for institutionalizing the KPAs at a higher capability level. \nIn other words, all KPAs up to and including the KPAs at that level must be institutionalized to \nachieve that level (footnote 10).

He examined internal audit standards from an international perspective and \nnoted that a large number of countries would face severe problems of meeting such standards. \nDiamond discussed the main issues to be addressed in developing internal audit in developing \nand transitional economies and offered a framework for introducing internal audit reforms. He \npointed out that the overall design of the internal audit function should be geared to the specific \npriorities of a country. For countries with governance problems, the primary objective should \nbe  to  ensure  compliance  with  financial  laws  and  regulations,  while  for  countries  with  a  high \ndegree  of  financial  stress,  the  macroeconomic  objectives  will  be  paramount.  Diamond\u2019s  main \nargument was that the same design for the internal audit function in the public sector cannot fit \nall countries. \n \nSullivan et al (2007) reviewed the tasks and design of audit committees in central banks. They \nargued  that  audit  committees  were  the  recommended  way  to  strengthen  financial \naccountability  and  central  bank  governance.  They  focused  on  the  functions  of  an  audit \ncommittee  and  concluded  that  the  effectiveness  of  an  audit  committee\u2019s  oversight  of  internal \ncontrols  and  financial  disclosure  may  provide  a  strong  safeguard  against  the  emergence  of \nreputational risk. They also stressed the importance of independence in the functioning of the \naudit committee and the qualification requirements to ensure that members on the committee \nare competent. \n \nThe  Bank  for  International  Settlements  paper  (BIS,  2012)  on  the  internal  audit  function  in \nbanks  stresses  the  importance  of  the  relationship  between  the  supervisory  body  (i.e.,  the \ncentral bank) and the internal audit function of banks. The paper lays down the principle for \neffective  interaction  through  regular  communication  between  the  supervisory  body  and \ninternal  audit  function  of  banks  to  (i)  discuss  the  risk  areas  identified  by  both  parties,               \n11 \n(ii)  understand  the  risk  mitigation  measures  taken  by  the  bank,  and  (iii)  monitor  the  bank\u2019s \n \n\n\f \n \n \u201c\u2026in addition to meetings with senior \nmanagement, supervisory authorities should meet periodically with the bank\u2019s internal auditors \nresponse to weaknesses identified. It further states that,\nto  discuss  their  risk  analysis,  findings,  recommendations  and  the  audit  plan\u2026\u201d\n\n \n\n.  It  also  stresses \ntwo-way  communication  between  the  supervisory  authorities  and  the  internal  auditors, \nwhereby  supervisory  authorities  may  consider  sharing  information  with  the  internal  audit \nfunction,  when  such  information  can  increase  the  effectiveness  of  the  function.  Also,  the \nsupervisory  authority  should  make  specific  recommendations  for  strengthening  the  control \nenvironment  and  the  internal  audit  function  (BIS,  2012).  The  inherent  implication  of  these \nprinciples  is  the  expectation  that  the  supervisory  authority  (i.e.,  the  central  bank)  will \nsupervise the internal audit function of the banks. To carry out this task effectively, the central \nbank will need to have a competent internal audit function in place, and this function will play \na  key  role  in  providing  an  independent  commentary  on  the  effectiveness  of  its  own  control \nenvironment. \n \nThe few completed studies on internal audit in the public sector for the ASEAN region do not \npresent  a  favorable  picture.  Ali  et  al  (2007)  studied  internal  audit  in  the  state  and  local \ngovernment in Malaysia, and found that only 35 out of 202 state and local government bodies \nhad  adequate  internal  audit  capacity.  They  used  the  politics  of  accountability  theory,  power \ndistance, and a Malaysian social context to explain cases that display a lack of transparency and \npublic  accountability  from  its  actors,  and  predicted  a  bleak  future  for  internal  audit.  They \nrecommended  measures  such  as  an  increase  in  resource  allocation  to  the  internal  audit \nfunction  in  the  public  sector,  increased  authority  and  greater  responsibility  for  internal \nauditors, and a change in understanding among all civil servants of the role of internal audit. \nImplementation of such measures would be needed to improve the future for internal audit in \nMalaysia\u2019s public sector.  \n \nJunio-Sabio  (2013)  studied  the  state  of  internal  audit  in  selected  Philippine  government \nagencies.  She  found  that  the  essential  internal  auditor  roles  are  generally  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  IIA  standards.  However,  she  noted  the  need  to  hone  the  competencies  of \ngovernment  internal  auditors  using  engagement  tools  that  include  sampling  and  statistical \nanalysis.  In  Indonesia,  Rahmatika  (2014)  studied  the  impact  of  the  internal  audit  function\u2019s \neffectiveness on the quality of financial reporting in local government, and concluded that the \ninternal audit function has a positive effect on the quality of financial reporting. \n \nApart from these studies, no other significant studies appear to have been undertaken in the \nASEAN region. It can be seen from the review of ASEAN studies that every study had a different \nobjective; hence, it is difficult to draw any comparative conclusion on the state of internal audit \nin the public sector in ASEAN.  \n \nOutside ASEAN, internal audit has been studied more extensively, mostly in the United States, \nUnited  Kingdom,  Canada  and  Australia.  In  addition,  key  studies  in  Sudan,  Israel,  and  South \nAfrica, countries similar to the studies in ASEAN, have focused on internal audit in the public \nsector. The key studies that have been undertaken are: \n \n\n\u2022  Sudan\n\n: In their study of internal audit in the Sudanese public sector, Brierley et al \n(2001) noted that the internal audit function is engaged in routine transactions, is \nstaffed  by \ninsufficient \ninexperienced  and  untrained  personnel,  and  has \nindependence  or  authority  to  function  as  an  effective  internal  audit  unit.  They \nconcluded  that  the  internal  audit  unit  failed  to  meet  even  one  of  the  five  core \nstandards  of  the  IIA.  They  considered  the  country\u2019s  poor  economy,  political \ninstability and corruption as the reasons for the bleak picture of the internal audit \nIsrael:\nfunction. \n\n  Similarly, Schwartz and Sulitzeanu-Kenan (2002), in their study of internal \nauditing in the Israeli public sector, found that efforts to strengthen internal audit \nthrough the internal audit law did not lead to a significant change in the functioning \n\n12 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\u2022  South Africa: \n\nof the internal audit activity in most government agencies. They use the politics of \naccountability  theory  to  explain  the  reason  for  ineffective  audit  legislation  and \nweak implementation.  \n\nRensburg and Coetzee (2016) studied the application of the IA-CM on \na  single  South  African  national  department  to  test  whether  the  model  was \nsuccessful in measuring internal audit capability. They chose the department with \nthe  most  effective  internal  audit  function,  as  it  had  a  better  chance  to  be  mature \nand  applicable  to  the  IA-CM.  They  concluded  that  the  model  was  successful  in \nmeasuring  the  internal  audit  capability  of  a  South  African  public  sector \norganization. They noted that, in some elements, the department appeared to have \nachieved a higher level, yet without fully achieving the KPA at the lower level. They \ntherefore  contested  that  it  may  not  always  be  possible  to  implement  the  IA-CM \nmodel in its current format within a global context, and recommended that IIARF \nshould clearly state that the model first be tested and adapted for a specific country \nor region prior to use. The conclusion on the usability of the IA-CM model is at odds \nwith the IIARF statement that the IA-CM has been globally validated and must be \nused  as  a  benchmark  tool  to  determine  current  capability  and \nfuture \ndevelopmental needs. \n\n \nBased  on  the  literature  review  (section  2.1  and  2.3),  central  banks  satisfy  the  boundary \nconditions laid down in section 1. Central banks hold a unique and important role in a nation\u2019s \neconomy  and  their  transactions  can  be  performed  only  by  a  public  sector  organization.  The \ncentral bank is also an institution that shares a mandate, which is similar across countries and \nis based on a legal framework\u2014the Bank Act. The  central bank is also expected to supervise \nthe internal audit function of institutions under its supervision, and as such can be expected to \nhave  a  well-developed internal  audit  function.  In  fact,  central  banks can  be  expected  to have \nthe most effective internal audit function among public sector organizations. \n \nThe study also reviewed different studies that measure the state of the internal audit function \nin public sector organizations. But as each study is unique, it becomes difficult to compare the \nstate of internal audit in the public sector across countries. However, the IA-CM developed by \nIIARF is a model that can be applied across countries and organizations of different size and \ncomplexity. Considering the diversity and different size and complexity of the countries in \nASEAN, The study applied the IA-CM model to the internal audit function of the central bank to \nunderstand  the  maturity  of  the  internal  audit  function  in  the  public  sector  across  ASEAN \nMember States. \n \n \n\n3.  METHODOLOGY \n\n \n\nResearch Method \n\n3.1\nThe study aims to benchmark the current internal audit practices in the public sector of ASEAN \nMember States, using the central bank as the public sector institution for the study, with a view \nto understanding the current capabilities and maturity of the internal audit function. The study \ndoes not focus on measuring the effectiveness of the internal audit function\u2019s activities; instead, \nits main objective is to benchmark the current activities against the IA-CM and evaluate gaps, if \nany, between the current capabilities and the model.   \n \nA survey was undertaken as the primary research method to gather information. This method \nwas chosen as it facilitated the ease of information gathering, considering the cost and time \nconstraints of the study. Moreover, this method of data collection is useful as responses can \nbe converted into data that can be analyzed for the presence or absence of a condition or \nset of conditions linked to the KPAs in the IA-CM model. Secondary sources did not reveal \ninformation on the state of IA function in central banks, hence a survey questionnaire was \n13 \nthe  best mean to collect the required information. The survey was based on IIA\u2019s 2010 and \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n2015 Global Internal Audit Survey (GIAS). The first step was to identify the questions that would \nserve as measures for the KPA of the IA-CM. The questions, which were based on IA-CM KPAs, \nrequired the respondents to decide whether to agree with a statement regarding the existence \nof a certain condition or set of conditions. Though the questions were largely close-ended, they \nwere  designed  to  provide  a  considerable  degree  of  flexibility  to  the  respondents.  The  survey \nwas  designed  to  capture  capability  levels  1-5,  though  for  certain  elements  the  questions \ncaptured  capability  levels  2-5,  as  at  capability  level  1  there  are  no  repeatable  and  sustainable \ninternal audit processes. For some elements, capability level 5 has not been captured, as level 5 \nis an aspirational level for the element concerned. The survey questions are listed in Annex 2. \n \nThe respondents for the survey were the chief audit executives (CAEs) or heads of audit of the \ncentral banks of the ASEAN Member States. These were selected because the CAEs or heads of \naudit  were  in  the  best  position  to  provide  an  objective  and  frank  response  to  the  survey, \nconsidering the time constraints and issue sensitivity of the study. \n \n\n3.2 Limitations \nAs the study aims to capture internal audit maturity in the public sector, using the central bank \nof each ASEAN country as the institution for the study, it is limited by the sample size. Moreover, \nas the data collection method is a survey, there can be an \u201cerror\u201d or \u201cbias\u201d in the study because \nof  the  respondents\u2019  interpretation  of  the  survey  questions.  For  contradictory  responses  by  a \nrespondent  to  linked  questions  in  the  survey,  clarification  was  sought  through  phone \ninterviews.  The  response  rate  for  the  survey  was  50%,  i.e.  only  5  of  the  10  central  banks \nresponded to the survey, despite conditions of anonymity. The reasons for not responding could \nbe (i) the perceived sensitivity of the issue being addressed in the study, and (ii) the CAEs\u2019 lack \nof  time.  As  the  response  rate  was  50%,  a  non-response  bias  may  impact  the  findings  of  the \nstudy.\n \nAnother limitation is that IIA\u2019s 2010 Global Internal Audit survey does not cover all the KPAs of \nthe IA-CM. While the 2015 survey has additional questions, which cover KPAs that were missing \nin the 2010 survey, all the KPAs are still not covered.

Services \ndepend on the needs of the organization and can consist of assurance and advice. Services can \nbe provided internally or co-sourced or outsourced.

Advisory services are typically consulting services provided by the \ninternal  audit  function  and  include  training,  system  development  reviews,  counselling  and \nadvice.  The  allocation  of  resources  between  advisory  and  assurance  services  depends  on  the \nobjective of the organization.  \n \nAll respondents indicated that they: \n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nfollow a systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, internal \ncontrols and governance processes; and \nprovide  an  internal  control  report  on  a  regular  basis,  with  60%  providing  it  annually \nand 40% on a periodic basis. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n15 \n\n\f \n \nPeople Management  \n \n\n \n\nPeople  management  deals  with  the  creation  of  a  work  environment  that  enables  people  to \n  It  involves  identifying  job  requirements,  providing \nperform  to  the  best  of  their  abilities.\ncontinuing  education,  hiring  qualified or  appropriate  people,  providing  ongoing  feedback,  and \ndesigning effective compensation and incentive programs.

Considering that level 5 is an aspirational \nlevel, it indicates that the internal audit activity faces challenges while providing audit coverage. \nWhile  60%  of  the  respondents  are  at  level  4  as  they  co-source  or  borrow  staff  from  other \ndepartments when facing a skill shortage, 40% indicated that they reduce the area of coverage. \n \nTeam  building  is  an  important  behavior  to  develop  in  team  members,  so  that  they  can  work \neffectively in a team environment.  Of the respondents surveyed, 80% listed this as a behavioral \nskill  expected  of  internal  audit  staff.  All  respondents  also  considered  confidentiality  and \nobjectivity and independent working as top behavioral skills to ensure that internal audit staff \nwill  perform  their  work  effectively.  Also,  60%  of  the  respondents  indicated  that  special \nincentives are in place to retain or hire staff for the internal audit function. \n \nFindings regarding CAEs are: \n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n60%  have  a  professional  certification  in  internal  audit,  while  40%  plan  to  take  a \ncertification in the next five years; \n80%  indicated  that  the  CAE  evaluation  is  performed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  or \nhead  of  government  agency  or  senior  management;  however,  20%  of  the  respondents \nwere not evaluated; and \n                                                           \n60% of the CAEs were receiving 40 hours of formal training per year. \n\n\u2022 \n\n Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).

For \nexample, 40% of the respondents do not have a quality assurance program in place, while 20% \ndo not have the three lines of defense (LoD) model in their institution. The 3 LoD model is a key \nrequirement  of  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission \n(COSO) framework, and has been adopted by BIS as a best practice. However, only 60% of the \nrespondents have confirmed that internal audit is considered the third line of defense, while, for \n20%, it is the second line of defense. Moreover, only 60% have indicated that their organization \nhas a formal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in place, while 20% have indicated that risk \nmanagement processes are developing. \n \nOf  the  respondents  to  the  survey,  60%  have  a  quality  program  in  place,  and  40%  have  an \nexternal  assessment  in  line  with  IIA  standard  1312.  All  respondents  have  indicated \nconformance with the IIA code of ethics; however, only 40% have confirmed conformance with \nall  requirements  of  the  IIA  standards.  The  existence  of  two  fundamental  requirements  of \nprofessional practices (an annual internal audit plan and an operating manual and policies) has \nbeen  confirmed  by  all  respondents.  In  addition,  40%  have  confirmed  the  existence  of  a  long-\nterm audit plan, which indicates that the function has a strategic view and is one of the KPAs at \nlevel  5.  A  majority  of  the  respondents  (60%)  confirm  the  existence  of  documented  audit \nprocedures that are monitored with manual checks and controls. As regards audit procedures, \n60%  have  procedures  that  are  documented  and  monitored  with  manual  checks  and  controls, \nwhile  only  20%  have  automated  checks  and  controls.  The  remaining  20%  have  documented \nprocedures in an audit manual, but these are not monitored. \n \nOther key findings are:  \n \n\n60% of the respondents have established an internal audit strategy; \n40% use a risk-based methodology while drawing up their internal audit plans; and \n60% base their audit plans on management/stakeholder priorities, and do not use risk-\nbased plans.  \n\nPerformance Management and Accountability \n \n \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nPerformance  management  and  accountability  deals  with  the  information  needed  to  manage, \n It \nconduct and control the operations of the internal audit function and account for its results.\nincludes  the  management  of  relevant  information  systems  and  financial  and  operational \nperformance.

However, the KPA for level 2, which \nrequires  commitment  and  support  through  senior  management  and  a  formally  approved \norganizational structure for the internal audit function, can be inferred through other elements \nof the IA-CM such as governance structures, people management and professional practices. \n \nRelationship  building  with  all  levels  of  management  is  a  key  behavioral  skill  for  Level  3  and \namong  the  top  5  behavioral  skills  required  by  internal  audit  staff  in  performing  their  work. \nThus, it is surprising that only 40% of the respondents considered this to be important. At Level \n3, it is also expected that internal auditors will liaise regularly with the organization\u2019s external \nauditors  to  share  plans  and  complement  their  work.  However,  only  20%  of  the  respondents \nindicated that they shared forms, or consulted with their organization\u2019s external auditors while \ndrawing up their audit plan. \n \nOther findings are: \n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nAll  respondents  agreed  that  internal  audit  plays  an  integral  part  of  the  governance \nprocess by providing reliable information to senior management; \n60%  agreed  that  internal  audit  plays  an  advisory  role  in  the  strategy  development  of \ntheir organization; \n80%  of  respondents  listed  (i)  the  ability  to  promote  the  value  of  the  internal  audit \nactivity within the organization as a key competency for the CAE, and (ii) influencing as \na key behavioral skill of the CAE. \n\nGovernance Structures \n \n \n\n18\n\nGovernance structures includes the reporting relationship (administrative as well as functional) \nof the CAE, and how the internal audit activity fits within the overall governance structure of the \n It also refers to the policies and procedures to support the internal audit activity \norganization.\nand ensure its independence.

Often,  internal  audit  reports \ndirected  to  elected  officials  can  be  detrimental  to  independence  of  the  function.  All \nrespondents  believe  that  their  function  is  independent  and  objective.  The  respondents  also \nindicated that the CAE reports administratively to the board committee or its equivalent or to \nthe  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  head  of  the  governing  body,  which  is  a  level  4  requirement.  As \nregards  functional  reporting,  the  level  4  requirement  is  that  the  CAE  reports  to  the  board \ncommittee or its equivalent, which is the case for 60% of the respondents. All respondents also \nindicated  that  top  management  is  involved  in  the  selection  of  the  CAE,  which  implies  the \nsupport of senior management for internal audit activities. \n \n \n\n     DISCUSSION \n\n5.\n\nThe  results  of  the  survey  reveal  some  differences  among  the  internal  audit  functions  in  the \n21 \nASEAN region. While the services provided by the internal audit function, as well as its role, are \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nconsistently  defined  across  the  member  states,  significant  variation  exists  regarding \nprofessional practices, people management and performance management. The remaining two \nelements\u2014governance  structures  and  organizational  relationships\u2014show  a  slight  variation \namong the member states. Despite the differences, we have identified some common gaps and \nsuggested steps that can be undertaken to bridge those gaps. \nAudit committees \n \n \n\nDiamond  (2002)  and  Sullivan  et  al  (2007)  have  discussed  the  importance  of  the  audit \ncommittee for ensuring  effective governance and strengthening the role of the internal audit \nfunction. Respondents from ASEAN states where an audit committee exists have indicated that \nthe presence of the committee adds value to the internal audit activity. Considering 40% of the \nrespondents indicated the lack of an audit committee, this is a key gap in the ASEAN region. An \naudit  committee  helps  to  review  the  work  of  the  function,  identify  important  areas  where \ncorrective  or  preventive  action  is  necessary,  and  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  audit \nrecommendations.  Considering  that  central  banks  are  expected  to  oversee  the  banking  and \nfinancial system as well as the internal audit function of the entities it supervises, the lack of an \naudit committee in a central bank can cause a \u201cprobity\u201d hazard (Oritani, 2010). Absence of an \naudit  committee  may  cause  a  \u201cprobity\u201d  hazard  in  the  internal  aspect  of  a  central  bank, \nwhich as per Oritani (2010) refers to the integrity of central bank officials and staff toward \nthe  mission,  their  professional  ability  and  process  adequacy.  Sulivan  et  al  (2007)  also \nconcluded that effectiveness of audit committee\u2019s oversight on financial reporting and internal \ncontrols provides a strong safeguard against the emergence of reputation risk. The lack of an \naudit committee can also have an impact on the objectivity and independence of the internal \naudit  function.  The  IIA  standard  1100  requires  the  CAE  to  have  unrestricted  access  to  the \nboard.  In  addition,  The  IIA  standard  1110  implies  that  full  organizational  independence  is \nachieved when the CAE reports  functionally to the board. Hence, countries that lack an audit \ncommittee  should  plug  the  gap  by  creating  and  implementing  an  audit  committee  charter. \nCountries can also use the legal framework\u2014an audit act\u2014 to mandate the formation of audit \ncommittees in public sector organizations. \nRisk management \n \n \n\nThe  internal  audit  function  is  expected  to  provide  assurance  on  an  organization\u2019s  risk \nmanagement processes, internal controls, and governance processes, and is expected to work \nclosely with the organization\u2019s risk management function. However, under no circumstance is \nthe internal audit function expected to perform management tasks, as its prime responsibility \nis  to  provide  independent  assurance  over  financial  controls  and  the  risk  management \nprocesses.  The  results of the  survey  showed  that 40%  of  the  respondents had  indicated  that \nrisk management processes are evolving, and internal audit is expected to be the second line of \ndefense,  or  that  the  three  line  of  defense  model  does  not  exist.  Considering  that  risks  in  the \npublic  sector  go  beyond  financial  and  operational  risk  and  can  include  societal  and  political \nrisk,  it  is  imperative  that  organizations  have  a  risk  management  function  in  place.  If  central \nbanks,  which  control  the  monetary  policy  as  well  as  act  as  bankers  to  the  government  and \nother  commercial  banks,  do  not  have  an  enterprise  risk  management  framework  in  place  or \nare  in  the  process  of  developing  risk  management  processes,  it  can  be  implied  that  central \nbank  may  not  have  a  proper  view  of  the  risk  faced  by  the  institution.  Considering  the \nunique  position  of  the  central  bank  in  a  country\u2019s  economy,  the  lack  of  adequate  risk \nmanagement  processes  or  framework  may  also  give  rise  to  probity  hazards  in  central \nbank transactions. In comparison, it is common practice in the private sector to have a risk \nmanagement committee to provide oversight of the risks faced by the organization as well as \nto  direct  the  risk  management  function.  Similarly,  efforts  should  be  made  to  strengthen  the \nenterprise  risk  management  program  and  processes  and  institute  risk  management \ncommittees to oversee the risk management function in the central bank(s) of responding \n22 \nASEAN Member States that currently lack risk management capabilities. \n \n\n\f \nRisk-based audit plans \n \n\n \n\nA  significant  proportion  of  the  respondents  indicated  that  they  do  not  use  risk-based  audit \nplans,  but  prepare  their  audit  plans  based  on  management/stakeholder  priorities.  Building \naudit plans on management/stakeholder priorities is relevant when the internal audit function \nis  at  level  2,  per  the  IA-CM.  However,  to  make  the  audit  function  more  objective,  it  needs  to \nfactor in risk-based audit plans. Basing the audit strategy and audit plans on risk exposure and \nthe likelihood of losses ensures that the internal audit function understands the organization\u2019s \nmain risks, and contributes to management\u2019s mitigation of them, thereby improving the overall \nrisk  profile  of  the  organization.  Moreover,  the  internal  audit  function  through  its  own  risk \nassessment  can  triangulate  on  the  risk  management  infrastructure  to  refine  its  annual  audit \nplan. Once determines, the plan can be used to determine the resource strategy for the internal \naudit  function.  Considering  that  risk  management  procedures  are  evolving  and  audit \ncommittees do not exist in certain countries, it is not surprising that the internal audit function \ndoes not use risk-based audit plans. The issue  could be addressed by putting in place  a risk \nmanagement  committee  and  adopting  the  three  lines  of  defense  model,  with  an  established \nenterprise risk management framework.  \nExternal review and quality assurance program \n \n \n\nAn  external  review  of  an  internal  audit  function  helps  to  identify  and  correct  substandard \npractices,  and  check  whether  internal  auditors  are  fulfilling  their  mandate  and  observing \ninternational  standards  (Diamond,  2002).  The  lack  of  a  quality  assurance  program  and  an \nexternal review can result in sub-optimal performance of the internal audit function, and may \ngive  rise  to  a  probity  hazard  in  the  internal  practice  of  the  function  (Oritani,  2010). \nMoreover,  the  Bank  for  International  Settlement  (BIS,  2012)  stressed  a  two-way \ncommunication  between  the  supervisory  board  and  the  internal  audit  function  of  the \ninstitution  it  supervises.  Authorities  may  consider  sharing  information  that  raises  the \neffectiveness  of  the  internal  audit  function  of  the  supervised  institution.  The  inherent \nimplication  of  the  principles  outlined  in  the  BIS  paper  is  the  expectation  that  the \nsupervisor  body  (i.e.,  central  banks)  will  supervise  the  internal  audit  function  of  the \nbanks, which implied central banks need to have a competent internal audit function. An \nexternal  review  and  quality  assurance  program  help  the  institution  to  measure  the \neffectiveness and competency of the internal audit function. Moreover, The IIA Standard \n1310  requires  the  quality  assurance  and  improvement  program  to  include  internal  and \nexternal  assessments.  Further  The  IIA  Standard  1311  states  that  internal  assessments \nmust include ongoing performance with the internal audit activity and periodic reviews \nperformed  through  self-assessment  or  by  other  person  within  the  organization  with \nsufficient knowledge of internal audit practices. These gaps can be addressed by putting in \nplace  a  quality  assurance  program  and  including  the  need  to  conduct  a  periodic  external \nreview through amendment to national audit acts for the public sector. Audit committees can \nalso  address  the  gap  by  reviewing  the  quality  assurance  and  external  assessment \nprogram of the internal audit function. \nStaff resources for information technology audits \n \n \n\nEmerging threats, specifically information technology threats, require public sector agencies \nto upgrade the knowledge and information technology auditing ability of their internal audit \nfunction. A significant proportion of the respondents in the study have indicated that they will \nbe  expected  to  undertake  an  increasing  number  of  technology  audits.  This  will  require  the \ninternal audit function to attract staff from within the organization or from the labor market. \nThe respondents indicated that it is easier to attract resources from the external market than \ninternally;  this  is  a  cause  for  concern.  While  central  banks  may  find  it  easier  to  attract \n23 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nresources,  studies  have  shown  that  it  is  difficult  for  public  sector  organizations  to  attract \ntalent.  Attributes  of  a  governance  structure  for  maintaining  probity  such  as  extensive \nprocedures for hiring and low powered incentives may affect hiring resources for technology \nauditors.  Hence,  efforts  should  be  made  to  create  programs  and  incentives  to  attract  staff \nfrom within the organization. This would require the CAE to influence stakeholders as well as \npromote  the  value  of  internal  audit  within  the  organization.  Alternatively,  due  to  the  fast \nevolving  nature  of  information  systems,  central  banks  and  public  sector  organizations \ncould look at the option of engaging external experts and develop in-house expertise to \ncarry out information technology audits. \nBudget and tracking of costs \n \n \n\nThe  ability  to  measure  the  performance  of  the  internal  audit  function  can  also  help  in \nnegotiating  audit  budgets  and  obtain  the  resources  needed  to  carry  out  activities  as  per  the \naudit  plan.  Currently,  only  20%  of  the  survey  respondents  provide  cost  information,  which \nmeant the majority might not have aligned budget to actual audit hours. Tracking actual cost \nand providing cost information to stakeholders could improve the performance management \nof  internal  audit  function.  Cost  tracking  can  help  gain  additional  funding  to  attract  the  right \ntalent  or  develop  the  IA  function\u2019s  internal  infrastructure  for  better  monitoring  of  audit \nprocedures. \n \nThe academic study examined the maturity of internal audit function in the public sector \nin ASEAN using central banks as proxy for the research where the internal audit maturity \nof  selected  central  banks  was  benchmarked  against  the  IA-CM  developed  by  The  IIA. \nRecognizing fully the study was an initial effort to examine internal audit maturity in the \npublic sector in ASEAN within a constrained time frame, it has certain limitations such as \nsmall sample size and non-response bias. The study showed that the role and services of \ninternal  audit  function  have  been  consistent  among  the  respondent  central  banks;  the \nfunction is independent and objective; and the involvement of political bias did not arise \nin the study. Nevertheless, the study highlighted certain opportunities that could improve \nfurther the capability of internal audit function. The opportunities centers on governance \nstructures  and  professional  practices  by  strengthening  enterprise  risk  management \nframework;  establishing  audit  committees  where  none  exist;  reinforcing  external \nassessment  and  quality  assurance  programs;  and  establishing  means  to  cope  with  new \nand emerging risks such as information technology. \n \nFuture academic studies can be undertaken with alternative public sector organizations \nwith  similar  characteristics  in  ASEAN  by  comparing  the  maturity  of  internal  audit \nfunction  with  central  banks.  Also,  comparative  studies  contrasting  the  internal  function \nin central banks outside ASEAN could be an interesting research. In conclusion, there are \nmany factors or public sector agencies that impact internal audit function, however with \nincreased  focus  on  financial  management  in  the  public  sector  as  well  as  the  private \nsector,  the  study  chose  an  institution,  central  banks,  that  plays  a  critical  role  in  the \ncountry\u2019s economy and supervises the financial stability and money flow of the economy, \nto gain further insight on the maturity of the internal audit function in the public sector in \nASEAN. \n\n24 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n, \n\n \n\n \n\nBibliography \n\nChapter1: Internal Auditing History,Evolution and Prospects.\n\n(IIA), I. o.
