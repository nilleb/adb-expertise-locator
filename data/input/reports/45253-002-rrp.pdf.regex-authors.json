THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed policy-\nbased loans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Third Capital Market Development \nProgram. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Developing the Capital Market, \nand  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  policy-based  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The program will provide budget support to enhance the role of capital markets in \nfinancial intermediation and resource mobilization in the economy by improving the allocative \nefficiency  between  savings  and  investment  through  expanding  as  well  as  diversifying  the \ninvestor base.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The government\u2019s Vision 2021 lays out a roadmap for Bangladesh to attain middle-\nincome status by 2021.3 It sets targets of reaching 8% gross domestic product annual growth by \nFY2015  and  10%  by  FY2021.  The  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2011\u2013FY2015 \nincludes a growth strategy to boost the rate of private investment and foster structural change. 4 \nIf Bangladesh is to attain its gross domestic product growth targets, it will have to address \nstructural deficiencies in the capital markets\u2014by deregulating the financial system to support the \nreal economy and promote private sector investment to reduce the infrastructure deficit, which is a \nmajor constraint to its sustainable and higher economic growth. \n \n4.  Government efforts and ADB policy dialogues. Building on ADB\u2019s experience in the \nsector,5 the  government  and  ADB  pursued  a  two-track  approach  to  address  structural \ndeficiencies  in  the  capital  markets  under  the  recently  concluded  Second  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Program: market stabilization and sustainable market development.6  \n \n5.  Following the stock market debacle in December 2010, where massive sell-off occurred \nas investors lost trust in the market and the regulatory agencies, the government implemented \nstabilization reforms under the second program, such as regulations on margin lending and \nequity exposure of banks, as well as enhanced oversight and policy coordination. The market \nhas gradually regained confidence, reflecting increasing traction from the policies and regulatory \nreforms. The market has stabilized, as evidenced by the 31% increase in market capitalization \nfrom $33.0 billion in February 2011 to $43.2 billion (as of September 2015). The contribution of \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Third Capital Market Development Program (TA \n8512-BAN). \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nthe banking sector has shown a well-received significant reduction of exposure to the stock \nmarket, and declined from 28.8% in December 2010 to 14.4% at the end of August 2015. The \nturnover ratios in 2014 and 2015 are comparable with levels recorded from 2004 to 2006, when \nthe market was functioning in a stable environment. Dhaka Stock Exchange\u2019s average daily \nturnover as a percentage of market capitalization from January 2014 to September 2015 was \n0.15% compared with a high of 0.73% on 6 December 2010.7 \n \n6.  The second program also brought about reforms that set the foundation for sustainable \nmarket development through the passage of critical legislation, which included amendments to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission Act, 1993; the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, \n1969; the Bank Companies Act, 2013; the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984; and the Stamp Act, \n1899; as well as enactment of the Demutualization Act, 2013 and the Financial Reporting Act, \n2015. The operational and financial efficiency of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange \nCommission (BSEC) was enhanced by allowing unhindered access to the BSEC Fund as well \nas removing government approval of the BSEC budget or expenditures from the BSEC Fund. \nThe operationalization of a state-of-the-art market surveillance system at BSEC increased the \ntransparency  of  market  transactions  and  contributed  significantly  to  enhanced  investor \nconfidence. Stock exchanges were identified as critical drivers of change under the second \nprogram. The governance structure was corrected through demutualization of the Dhaka and \nChittagong stock exchanges, which aligned the broader incentives of market development with \nthose of the \u201cclub members,\u201d mainly the brokers and dealers. Bond market development was \nalso supported by implementing a fast-track regulatory process for private placements that \nbalanced investor protection with ease of approval, and removing tax distortions to trigger bond \nmarket activity. \n \n7.  Remaining  sustainable  market  development  constraints.  Despite  Bangladesh\u2019s \nmajor strides toward strengthening its capital markets, the following constraints remain:8 \n \n(i)  BSEC staffing remains inadequate, which restricts the regulator from carrying out \nits  mandate  effectively.  Furthermore,  the  absence  of  an  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) system at BSEC limits the effectiveness of the \nregulator. These organizational constraints affect market confidence. \n(ii)  The entry of strategic investors as key shareholders in both stock exchanges is \nrequired  to  ensure  successful  completion  of  the  demutualization  process.  The \nabsence of such strategic investors prevents the development of necessary new \ntechnology  infrastructure  and  constrains  the  drive  for  innovation  and  overall \ndevelopment of the capital market. \n(iii)  The  capital  market  participation  of  institutional  investors,  such  as  insurance \ncompanies, is limited. Most of the regulatory legislation under the Insurance Act, \n2010 is yet to be adopted by the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority \n(IDRA), such as asset investment regulations and recapitalization measures. With \nregard to mutual fund demand, impediments curtail growth such as an uneven \nplaying field between different types of mutual funds, and a limited range of \nmutual fund types. \n(iv)  Supply of equities is deterred by  the current initial  public offering (IPO)  book-\nbuilding method, which restricts price discovery. Demand for equities is hampered \n                                                 \n7  Second Capital Market Development Program: Impact and Results Assessment (accessible from the list of \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (Capital Markets) (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). ", "3 \nby unreliable accounting and auditing standards of listed companies, which prevent \ninformed investment decisions, as well as an IPO lock-in period of 3 years for \nlicensed private equity investor, which hinders private equity fund activity. Demand \nfor bonds is constrained by the prevalence of fiscal dominance, which prevents \ncompetitive  auctioning  of  government  securities  based  on  market  prices. \nConsequently, primary dealers hold their portfolio of government securities until \nmaturity  to  minimize  losses,  which  impedes  the  development  of  a  secondary \ngovernment  bond  market.  The  corporate  bond  market,  therefore,  hardly  exists \nbecause of the absence of a credible government yield curve. \n(v)  The absence of alternative financial instruments limits the depth and breadth of \nBangladesh\u2019s capital markets. The lack of a regulatory framework for alternative \nfinancial instruments, such as derivatives and sukuks (Sharia-compliant bonds), is a \nmajor factor for the absence of such instruments. The absence of a clearing and \nsettlement company also prevents the promotion of derivatives because of the lack \nof critical market infrastructure required for netting of transactions. \n \n8.  To address the constraints, the government and ADB agreed to build on stabilization \nmeasures introduced by the second program and implement the road map in the long-term \nnational capital market master plan that was formulated as a second program policy action. The \nprogram will deepen and broaden the outreach of the second program reforms by (i) extending \nthe government yield curve and, therefore, promoting a more liquid government bond market \nand  eventually  corporate  bond  market;  (ii)  catalyzing  institutional  investor  demand  by \nbroadening, deepening, and diversifying the investor base; and (iii) enhancing the supply of \nalternative financial instruments. \n \n9.  Linkage between reform program and budget support. The structural reforms under \nthe program include costly measures, such as a significant enhancement in the regulatory and \nenforcement capacity of BSEC and IDRA, as well as an upward shift in the rates of treasury bills \nand bonds to be more aligned with market rates. Budget support is crucial to support costs to \nimplement the reform program. Since the reforms are an integral part of a government-owned \nlong-term development strategy (i.e., the long-term national capital market master plan), the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to institute the capital market reform program, as well as its ability \nand political will to implement the needed reforms, are firm (Appendix 3). \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s  value  additions.  Since  the  late  1980s,  the  government  and  ADB  have \nconducted extensive policy dialogues on capital market development.9 The dialogue provided \nthe basis for project support that improved good governance practices in the capital market and \nthe insurance sector, which led to the establishment of a new insurance regulatory authority in \n2010.10 The Improvement of Capital Market and Insurance Governance Project (footnote 10) \nalso contributed to the formulation of the second program, which was built from other key inputs, \nsuch as project preparatory TA in 2011, a study of the role of banks in Bangladesh\u2019s stock \nmarket  volatility  in  June  2011,  and  a  study  on  demutualization  of  stock  exchanges  in \nBangladesh in 2012. The program includes reforms that are part of the national capital market \n                                                 \n9  Since 1993, ADB has approved two major programs that includes the Capital Market Development Program in \n1997 as well as 18 TA projects in capital market development, which have built the reform momentum leading to \nthe  proposed  program.  Through  these  programs,  ADB  has  uniquely  gained  an  in-depth  understanding  of \nBangladesh\u2019s capital markets for effectively managing reforms.

ADB\u2019s intensive engagement with the government over the past 25 years has ensured \nthat it is the lead development partner for capital market development in Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s  \nstrength lies in its integrated policy support, which focuses on \u201chow to do it\u201d and covers (i) policy \ndialogue,  (ii)  structure  and  design  of  tailor-made  policy  reforms,  (iii)  policy  implementation \nsupport, (iv) capacity development through TA to ensure sustainability, and (v) procurement of \ninformation technology systems to strengthen operations. Few development partners have the \nsame level of credibility, the means, or the capacity to offer this solutions-based approach that \ncan  effectively  and  consistently  tailor  these  best  practices  to  the  needs  and conditions  of \nBangladesh\u2019s capital markets. In the absence of ADB involvement in capital market reforms, \nand given the complexities, resources, and expertise, such reforms would not have happened. \n \n12.  Development  coordination.  The  development  partner  coordination  arrangement  is \nguided by the Bangladesh Joint Cooperation Strategy, 2010\u20132015.12 The International Monetary \nFund, the World Bank, and ADB are the key development partners supporting the government \nin undertaking finance sector reforms. In April 2012, the International Monetary Fund approved \nan Extended Credit Facility of about $1 billion for Bangladesh with the objective of restoring \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  strengthening  the  external  position.  Two  tranches  (about \n$140 million each) remain for completion of the Extended Credit Facility. The World Bank\u2019s \nproposed $300 million Financial Sector Support Project in 2015 will emphasize strengthening \nthe regulatory capacity of Bangladesh Bank and developing the insurance sector in areas that \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  program.  ADB  is  the  lead  development  partner  for  capital  market \ndevelopment and retains this role under the program. \n \n13.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy and lessons learned. ADB\u2019s finance sector strategy \nfor  Bangladesh,  which  is  included  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  and  the  new  country \noperations business plan, is based on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, lessons from ADB\u2019s previous \nfinance sector interventions, and coordination with other development partners.13 In line with the \nSixth Five-Year Plan and the Midterm Review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 priorities, capital market \ndevelopment and bond market development focusing on the provision of long-term infrastructure \nis one of ADB\u2019s focus areas in its Bangladesh public sector operations.14 The program is fully \naligned with the government\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan, ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, and ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Bangladesh. \n \n14.  The program (Appendix 4) will build on lessons from the second program completion, \nthe first program performance audit report, and the review by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation \n                                                 \n11 Eight national stakeholder  and dissemination  workshops  were held for demutualizing the stock exchanges, \ndeveloping the primary dealer system, and formulating the second program and the proposed third program. \n12 Government of Bangladesh. 2010.

Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The impact will be a well-functioning financial system that supports basic capital and \ninvestment needs, as well as Bangladesh\u2019s longer-term economic objectives. The outcome will \nbe enhanced capacity and size of the capital market in a strong legal and regulatory framework. \nThe program has 8 first tranche policy actions and 18 second tranche policy actions. All first \ntranche policy actions are fully complied. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Strengthened  market  stability. The output will promote more robust, resilient, and \nstable capital markets by enhancing BSEC\u2019s role to develop and monitor the market, strengthen \nregulatory measures, and develop a clearing and settlement company. The approval of BSEC\u2019s \norganogram  will  significantly  enhance  its  regulatory  and  enforcement  capacity  as  well  as \npromote market stability through the induction of additional full-time staff. The installation of an \nICT  system  at  BSEC  will  create  synergistic  effects  at  the  regulatory  agency  by  raising \nproductivity levels. In line with international best practice, amendment of the IPO book-building \nrules to make the price discovery method more effective will promote equity financing. The \noutput  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of  a  clearing  and  settlement  company,  which  will \neventually enable a central counterparty entity to be guarantor for settlement of derivative \ncontracts. \n \n17.  Enhanced market facilitation. The output will support more efficient mobilization and \nallocation  of  resources  in  the  economy  by  expediting  adjudication of  enforcement  actions, \nupgrading  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and  pursuing  demutualization  of  the  stock \nexchanges. The enhanced enforcement capacity at BSEC will be complemented by expedited \nadjudication  of  enforcement  actions  through  the  operationalization  of  a  special  tribunal  for \ncapital market-related cases. The establishment of an adequately funded financial reporting \ncouncil (i.e., an independent audit oversight authority) will lead to adoption of the International \nAccounting Standards and International Standards on Auditing, which will enhance market \nconfidence and allow for informed investment decisions. The demutualization will also facilitate \nthe development of crucial new technology infrastructure through the entry of strategic investors \ninto both stock exchanges by the end of 2016. \n \n18.  Enhanced supply measures. The output will increase the supply of quality bonds and \nalternative  financial  instruments  through  the  capital  markets.  Numerous  measures  will  be \nintroduced to catalyze the corporate bond market such as removal of the 60:40 debt-to-equity \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2015.

A reduction in the IPO lock-in period for licensed private equity investors will spur \nprivate equity fund activity in the capital markets and increase demand for equities. Alternative \nfinancial instruments (derivatives and sukuks) will be promoted to develop a deeper and broader \ncapital market by focusing on the enabling regulatory framework. The issuance of sukuk rules \nwill promote Islamic finance and increase the number of sukuk issues. The introduction of \nregulations  for  issuing  derivatives  will  encourage  the  development  of  instruments  such  as \ninterest rate swaps and currency swaps. \n \n19.  Enhanced  demand  measures.  The  output  will  support  the  mobilization  of  capital \nmarket financing by developing liquid bond markets, enhancing institutional investor demand, \nand promoting mutual funds. A strategy of creating liquid benchmark issues will be pursued \nthrough the introduction of floating rate notes in the government bond auction system on a pilot \nbasis and allowing for short selling of primary dealer-owned government securities that permit \npositions to be hedged, thereby generating secondary bond market activity. Insurance industry \nparticipation in the capital market will be enhanced by first introducing measures to promote the \nindustry\u2019s growth and stability, such as compliance with the minimum capital requirements of the \nInsurance  Act,  2010,  and  then  encouraging  investor  demand  through  issuing  investment \nguidelines  by  IDRA.  Approval  of  the  IDRA  organogram  will  significantly  enhance  IDRA\u2019s \nregulatory  capacity.  A  robust  mutual  fund  industry  will  be  promoted  by  rule  changes  that \n(i) ensure a level-playing field between the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) and \nnon-ICB funds by removing the exemption that allows ICB and its Asset Management Company \nto act as trustee of the new funds where ICB itself is the sponsor, (ii) allow investors in fixed-\nincome mutual funds the same tax treatment as equity mutual funds, and (iii) promote exchange \ntraded funds. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n20.  The program loan size is $250 million, which will be made available in two tranches: $80 \nmillion in tranche 1 and $170 million in tranche 2, to be released approximately 18 months after \nfirst tranche disbursement. The proposed tranche amounts mirror the number of substantive \npolicy actions required for release of each respective tranche, i.e., eight policy actions for \ntranche 1 release and 18 policy actions for tranche 2 release. The first tranche will be available \nupon loan effectiveness.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s financial support addresses the development financing needs. In particular, the \ncounterpart fund generated out of the loan proceeds finances development expenditures in the \nform of cost of adjustment under the proposed reforms. The estimated cost of adjustment \nacross program outputs is (i) $110 million for market stability (BSEC additional staff, operation \nand maintenance cost of BSEC ICT equipment, establishment of a clearing and settlement \ncompany, and intermediaries\u2019 recapitalization costs); (ii) $20 million for market facilitation and \nsupply measures (costs of demutualization, operationalization of capital market tribunal, and \nestablishment of the financial reporting council); and (iii) $155 million for demand measures \n(cost of paying market prices for government securities, IDRA additional staff and training, and \ninsurance recapitalization costs).17 \n \n22.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \n                                                 \n17 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 10.39 years and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. \nThe government has also requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR71,683,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% per annum during the grace \nperiod and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nprogram agreements. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The executing agency will be the Bank and Financial Institutions Division (BFID) of the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF). The implementing agencies will be the BSEC, Bangladesh Bank, \nand  IDRA.  The  program  will  be  supported  by  other  key  government  agencies  that  are \nresponsible for undertaking numerous policy actions. It is being implemented from January 2015 \nto December 2017. An interagency program steering committee, chaired by the BFID secretary, \nhelped  drive  the  reforms  in  preparation  of  the  first  tranche  policy  reform  measures.  The \nagencies under the committee include the MOF, Bangladesh Bank, the National Board of \nRevenue, BSEC, and IDRA. The interagency program steering committee will also supervise \nimplementation of the remaining program. The committee will be supported by a secretariat \ncomposed of staff with the requisite technical skills. \n \n24.  Tranches, disbursement, and counterpart funds. The loans will be provided in two \ntranches  and  will  be  disbursed  upon  fulfillment  of  the  respective  program  policy  actions \n(Appendix 4).  The  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsimplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based grants.18 \nThe proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured \nin ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible items and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources.19 ADB will have the right to audit the use of \nthe loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  Attached TA for Developing the Capital Market will support the implementation of key \nreform  actions  under  the  program.20 The  major  outputs  and  activities  of  the  TA  include \n(i) installation and operationalization of BSEC\u2019s new ICT system, (ii) draft rules for derivatives by \nBSEC, (iii) facilitation of the establishment of a clearing and settlement company, (iv) draft \nregulations for the issuance of sukuks by BSEC, and (v) provision of training to IDRA additional \nstaff  that  will  be  mobilized  after  IDRA  organogram  approval.  Training  areas  will  include \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  mechanisms  to  oversee  insurance  companies,  monitoring  and \nevaluation  procedures,  ICT  management,  corporate  management  of  insurance  companies, \nidentification and management of governance issues, as well as the study of actuarial analysis. \nADB will provide $400,000 on a grant basis for the TA from its TASF-V and will administer an \nadditional $300,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund to support BSEC\u2019s ICT system. The TA to be provided by ADB \nand  the  Republic  of  Korea  for  BSEC-related  activities  will  be  part  of  wider  capacity  and \ninstitutional  development  initiatives  being  contemplated  by  the  government,  which  includes \ninstallation of the entire BSEC ICT system and strengthening of the Bangladesh Institute of \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998.

The executing agency for the TA will be \nthe BFID of the MOF. The BSEC will be the implementing agency for the TA, which will be \nimplemented over 2.5 years, starting in January 2016. ADB will engage consultants through a \nconsulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office,  office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The  program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for  productive \ninvestment and employment generation by supporting the development of bond and equity \ncapital markets. It will help ensure balanced development of the finance sector, which will \nreduce systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated financial system. Specific benefits are as \nfollows: \n(i)  By  addressing  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  to  the  issues  of  corporate \nsecurities, the program will help increase the number of bond and equity issues, \nboth primary and secondary. This will facilitate the mobilization of scarce financial \nresources  for  long-term  private  sector  investment,  including  infrastructure \ninvestment. \n(ii)  By promoting the development of corporate securities markets and institutional \ninvestors, thereby diversifying financial instruments and broadening the investor \nbase, the program will reduce market volatility and improve the resilience of the \nfinance sector to external shocks. \n(iii)  By  strengthening  market  governance  in  capital  markets,  the  program  will \nenhance market efficiency and transparency, and improve investor protection. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n27.  Public financial management reform has been undertaken to make resource allocation \nmore effective, prioritize spending, and increase budget execution capability. The government \nimplemented comprehensive governance reforms including the establishment of an independent \nAnti Corruption Commission in 2004; separation of the judiciary from the executive in 2007, which \nrendered the Supreme Court independent and brought magistrates exercising judicial functions \nunder the control of the Supreme Court; enactment of the Right to Information Act, 2009 and \nimmediate establishment of the Information Commission; as well as the Whistleblower Protection \nAct, 2011. The government adopted a new approach to budget planning, with the introduction of \nthe medium-term budget framework in all line ministries, and the establishment of an integrated \nbudget and accounting system in 2009 that connected accounting offices in all districts and chief \naccounts  offices  of  the  line  ministries  with  the  MOF.  Under  the  Public  Money  and  Budget \nManagement Act, 2009, the finance minister is required to submit quarterly progress reports to \nParliament  on  the  utilization  of  budgeted  appropriations  and  progress  in  public  expenditure \nmanagement. Furthermore, greater responsibility and accountability was assigned to BSEC under \nthe second program through clear rules of engagement  under the  amended  Securities and \nExchange Commission Act, 1993, which contributed to improved governance in the financial \nsystem. In October 2012, the National Integrity Strategy was approved by the government and \nsupported by ADB\u2019s Good Governance Program, which represents a comprehensive institutional ", "9 \napproach to fight corruption. 21 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the BFID of the MOF. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The capital market reforms under the program will play an important role in raising funds \ncost-effectively and in enabling investors to gain access to alternative investment opportunities, \nas well as mitigating the negative impact that financial market instability has on the plight of the \npoor. Diversification away from a predominantly bank-based system of financial intermediation \nexpands alternative sources of credit, helping to limit the systemic impacts of economic shocks. \nCapital markets can stimulate healthy competition with the banking sector that results in lower \nfinancing costs for all borrowers. The program, therefore, emphasizes specific capital market \nreforms to help Bangladesh diversify its financial system so that the country can realize its \nbroad-based economic growth and socioeconomic development objectives, including poverty \nreduction. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Capital market reforms supported by the program have been evaluated by the borrower \nand/or client and ADB. The evaluation shows that the reforms will have no anticipated direct or \nindirect environmental impacts, will not cause involuntary resettlement, and will have no impacts \non indigenous peoples. In this regard, the program is categorized C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The program\u2019s risk assessment is rated low since (i) ADB has solid experience in the \nsector in Bangladesh; (ii) the BFID, the proposed executing agency, has a good performance \nrecord in externally financed project implementation; and (iii) the program is unlikely to have any \nimpact on safeguards. Major risks that could affect the program implementation and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in the following table and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.22 \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nResistance to reforms from vested interests  The chairperson of the steering committee will have \nthe authority to enforce progress and ensure strong \ncommitment among stakeholders and strong \nownership of reforms through approval of the \nnational capital market master plan. \nWeak implementation capacity of government  The technical assistance provided will facilitate the \nagencies  implementation of second tranche actions by \ngovernment agencies. \nInadequate coordination among government  A program steering committee established for \nagencies  proper coordination. \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2007.
