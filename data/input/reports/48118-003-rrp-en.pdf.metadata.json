The impact of the ongoing project is strengthened GMS public health \nsecurity.  The  outcome  is  GMS  health  system  performance  with  regard  to  health  security \nimproved.  As  of  7  May  2020,  the  Lao  PDR  has  officially  reported  19  confirmed  coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) cases, with evidence of limited local transmission.4 While the cases remain \nrelatively limited, there are serious concerns about the level of preparedness in the event of any \npandemic resurgence. The proposed additional financing for the Lao PDR aims to scale up the \nongoing  project\u2019s  interventions  in  emerging  infectious  diseases,  particularly  COVID-19.5 It  will \nsupport the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-\n19, 6 which  aims  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  possible  large-scale  community  transmission  and \nimprove pandemic preparedness. The additional financing will address the immediate needs for \nprocuring  and  distributing  essential  medical  supplies  and  equipment,  scaling  up  capacity  for \nlaboratory testing and case management, and strengthening the health system for coping with \nsimilar  emerging  infectious  disease  outbreaks  in  the  medium  and  long  term.  The  report  and \nrecommendation  of  the  President  for  the  ongoing  project  is  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe proposed project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing. The impact and \noutcome of the project remain unchanged. The implementation of the ongoing project in the Lao \nPDR is on track as of 30 April 2020. Against an elapsed time of 59%, cumulative contract awards \nfor the loan and grant are $7.05 million (59% of ADB financing), and cumulative disbursements \nare $8.51 million (71% of ADB financing). All safeguard and financial covenants have either been \nachieved or are being complied with.7 The delivery of expected outputs is rated successful, and \nthe  project  is  on  track  to  achieve  the  intended  output  and  outcome  indicators.  The  identified \n\nfinancing approved in March 2020.  \n\n \n\n1  This Report and Recommendation of the President has been prepared using the simplified template for additional \n\n2   The ongoing project comprises (i) loans to Cambodia (SDR15,012,000 [$21 million]), the Lao PDR (SDR2,856,000 \n[$4 million]), Myanmar ($12 million), and Viet Nam (SDR56,946,000 [$80 million]); and (ii) a grant to the Lao PDR \n($8 million). ADB also provided project preparatory technical assistance of $1.3 million to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam. ADB. Regional: Greater Mekong Subregion Health Security Project; and ADB.

The Government of Myanmar is also \n\nconsidering additional financing under the ongoing project to scale-up COVID-19 response. \n\n6   Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Health. 2020. National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19. \n\nVientiane.   \n\n7  See detailed discussion on covenants in footnote d of Table 3. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fproject implementation risks have been adequately addressed, and the management of risks is \nrated successful. \n \n4. \nThe  additional  financing  interventions  are  aligned  with  outputs  2  and  3  of  the  ongoing \nproject  to  improve  surveillance  and  strengthen  the  laboratory  system  and  hospital  infection \nprevention and control (IPC). The additional investment in lab testing and hospital service capacity \nwill meet the greater than anticipated need during any COVID-19 outbreak that the country may \nexperience  when  the  economy  opens  up  after  the  current  containment  measures  are  relaxed \n(para. 6). The project interventions will be expanded from 15 to all 17 provinces of the Lao PDR. \nThe  existing  project  management  unit  can  expedite  implementation  of  the  new  activities. \nTherefore, the additional financing is considered the most responsive and appropriate approach \nfor  delivering  the  urgently  needed  assistance.  The  proposed  additional  financing  has  been \ndetermined to be technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound (Table 3). \n  \nThe  GMS  Health  Sector  Working  Group8 met  in December  2019  and  reconfirmed  their \n5. \nstrong  commitment  to  regional  health  security  and  achieving  the  core  capacities  of  the \nInternational Health Regulations (2005).9 They endorsed the GMS Health Cooperation Strategy \n2019-2023,10 which the project continues to support. The overall project remains consistent with \nthe ADB Strategy 2030,11 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR, 2017\u20132020, \nwhich prioritizes investment for enhanced human development.12  \n \n6. \nThe Lao PDR is highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic as many migrant workers \nare  returning  from  heavily  affected  neighboring  countries. 13 The  National  Preparedness  and \nResponse  Plan  has  projected  that  in the  scenario  of  widespread community  transmission,  the \ncountry could have 20,000 cases at the peak, of which about 4,500 will be severe or critical cases \nthat  need  hospitalization.  Although the  country  has made  steady  progress  under previous  and \nongoing  CDC  projects  (footnote  2)  to  improve  the  response  capacity  to  emerging  infectious \ndiseases, its health system remains weak and could be overwhelmed by rapid spread of the virus. \nAt the end of 2019, the Lao PDR had 190 beds for critical care, 74 working ventilators, and only \n118 doctors and 222 nurses working in intensive care units in all central and provincial hospitals. \nThe three central reference laboratories can perform about 300 COVID-19 confirmation tests per \nday, whereas the plan targets at scaling up to 1,000 tests per day including adding capacity in \nselected  provinces.  Further,  the  country  faces  a  severe  shortage  of  medical  supplies  and \nequipment to mitigate the impact of possible large-scale community transmission. This includes \n(i) personal protective equipment (e.g., masks, gowns, goggles, and gloves) and disinfectants; (ii) \nlaboratory  equipment,  testing  kits,  and  other  consumables;  (iii) equipment  and  supplies  for \nsupportive treatment in hospitals;14 and (iv) ambulances and other vehicles. The government has \nrequested  the  proposed  additional  financing  to  procure  part  of  the  supplies  and  equipment  on \ntheir  master  procurement  list.15 In  addition,  rapid  training  on  IPC  and  case  management  for \n\n \n\n8  The working group is composed of senior health officials from GMS countries and is supported by ADB.  \n9   WHO. 2005.

The additional financing will also support broader whole-of-society interventions, as \naccurate  information  and  effective  risk  communication  are  critical  for  mitigating  the  risks  of \nwidespread community transmission.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe project impact and outcome will remain the same. The additional financing proposes \na new output: emergency response to the COVID-19 outbreak supported (output 4). The main \nactivities  under  output  4  include:  (i)  the  procurement  and  distribution  of  medical  supplies  and \nequipment  (items  in  para.  6)  to  hospitals  at  all  levels  according  to  needs,  including  equipping \nLuang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Champasak, three of the largest provinces in the Lao PDR, \nwith COVID-19 confirmation test capacity of about 150-180 per day in each province. (ii) rapid \ntraining for frontline health workers on IPC, lab testing, and clinical care for COVID-19; and (iii) \nsome non-pharmaceutical interventions, including risk communications and contact tracing. While \nthe  activities  fall  within  the  scope  of  outputs  2  and  3  of  the  ongoing  project,  a  new  output  is \nproposed for effectiveness and efficiency in administration and monitoring.  The revised design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nADB is a trusted and leading development partner in the health sector in the Lao PDR, \nwith  more than two  decades of  continuous  engagement.  Through  the  ongoing  project  and the \nHealth  Sector  Governance  Program, 16  ADB  has  supported  the  government\u2019s  Health  Sector \nReform Strategy, including strengthening communicable disease surveillance and response. The \nongoing project supported Ministry of Health (MOH)\u2019s procurement of the first batch of COVID-19 \nresponse supplies and equipment in March 2020. The strategic long-term investment in CDC as \na regional public good in the GMS may have contributed to the relatively well-managed COVID-\n19 outbreak in the subregion so far.17 A new project under preparation since 2019 will focus on \nimproving the quality of health care and achieving universal health coverage by 2025. The Lao \nPDR  benefits  from  regional  knowledge  platforms  hosted  by  ADB  for  knowledge  sharing  and \nregional cooperation through ongoing technical assistance on GMS health cooperation.18  \n \n9. \nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ADB has quickly responded to requests from \nSoutheast Asian countries with timely, scaled, coordinated, and practical solutions that meet the \nneeds  of  governments.19 To  facilitate  rapid  assistance  to  COVID-19  response,  ADB  applies  a \nstreamlined approval process and more flexible procurement rules.20 ADB has also established \nstrategic  partnerships  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  and  facilitated  project \nprocurement planning by linking the MOH with credible global suppliers to cope with the volatility \nof the global supply market for COVID-19 medical equipment and consumables.

Two additional provincial health offices will be added as implementing \nagencies.23 The project will engage international procurement agents to facilitate the procurement \nof goods. The implementation arrangements are described in detail in the project administration \nmanual (footnote 22).   \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nSummary Due Diligence Results \n\n \nA. \n \nA  summary  of  the  due  diligence  assessments  carried  out  for  the  proposed  additional \n14. \nfinancing is presented in Table 3. The full due diligence assessments are accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2.  \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \n\nArea of \nAssessment \nEconomic \nand financial \nviability \n\nSummary of Assessment \nFollowing  the  2017  ADB  guidelines  on  economic  analysis,a  the  cost-effectiveness  analysis \nconducted for the additional financing shows that the cost per DALY is less than GDP per capita, \nmaking  the  intervention  very  cost-effective.b  The  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  conducted  for  the  original \nproject was also updated. An EIRR of 29.4% was estimated for  the proposed additional financing \nproject, which is above the minimum required threshold of 6% for social sector investments. \n\nSustainability   The project is likely to be sustainable given the government\u2019s commitment to cover operational and \nmaintenance costs. The government continues to provide strong support to the health sector and \n\n23 In the ongoing project, 15 provincial health offices, the Communicable Disease Control Department, and the National \n\nCenter for Laboratory and Epidemiology are the key implementing agencies. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nArea of \nAssessment \n\nSummary of Assessment \nincreased health sector funding from 2015 to 2019, allowing enough headroom to absorb recurrent \ncosts  after  implementation.  However,  with  high  fiscal  debt  and  low  reserves,  broader  economic \npressures remain. The IMF\u2019s 2019 debt sustainability analysis assessed the Lao  PDR at high risk \nfor debt distress.c It also underlines the country\u2019s high exposure to contingent liability risks, especially \nthose  related  to  state-owned  enterprises  in  the  energy  sector.d  COVID-19  will  almost  certainly \nexacerbate  these  challenges,  and  support  from  development  partners  is  critical  in  promoting \nmacroeconomic stability. \n\ninclude \n\nthe  consideration  of \n\ntechnical  support  required \n\nPoverty, \nsocial, and \ngender \n\nGovernance  The pre-mitigation financial management risk of the project is rated substantial. Emergency response \nmay  result  in  lack  of  preparedness  of  the  procurement  and  financial  management  system  and \nprocesses.  The  additional  financing  will  continue  to  use  the  PFM  system  developed  under  the \nongoing project, for which no major issues have been identified to date. A separate advance account \nwill  be  established.  The  State  Audit  Organization  will  perform  external  audits  on  all  additional \nfinancing activities as part of the annual audit process for the overall project. With the mitigations, \nthe risk is moderate. \nAn procurement assessment was undertaken to ensure value for money and the effectiveness of the \nemergency  procurement;  mitigate  risks  around  supply  chain  volatility,  security,  and  quality  of  the \nsupply;  and \ninstallation, \ncommissioning, and maintenance of specialized equipment. \nPoverty.  COVID-19  is  expected  to  affect  household  incomes  negatively.  It  is  likely  to  result  in \n100,000 more people living below the poverty line of $1.9/day,  200,000 more people living below \n$3.2/day,  and  another  200,000  more  people  living  below  $5.5/day.e  Maximum  preparedness \ncontributes to the mitigation of the negative impacts. \nGender. The additional financing is categorized some gender elements. An updated gender action \nplan has been prepared.f As the main activities under the additional financing are procurement of \nmedical  supplies  and  equipment,  gender  features  that  can  be  accomplished  within  its  scope  are \nlimited. The project will ensure that PPE fits female and male health workers, and will support the \ndevelopment  of  gender-responsive  guidelines,  protocols,  and  training  materials  to  take  into \nconsideration the different needs, experiences, and impacts of COVID-19 on males and females. \nThe ongoing project remains effective gender mainstreaming. \nThe additional financing is classified category C for environmental safeguards, as it will not involve \nany  civil  works  or  any  activities  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  The  ongoing  project  remains \ncategory B for environment.  \nThe additional financing is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts. No land acquisition or resettlement impacts are envisaged. Indigenous peoples will not be \nspecifically targeted,  so no direct or indirect impacts are envisaged. The  ongoing project remains \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and category B for indigenous peoples.  \n\nSafeguards \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  DALY  =  disability-adjusted  life  year, \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, Lao PDR = \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, PFM = public financial management, PPE = personal protective equipment. \na   ADB. 2017.
