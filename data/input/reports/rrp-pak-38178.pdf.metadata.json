The Project has three components: (i) \nimprovement  of  quality  and \ninstitutional  development; \nrelevance improvement; and (iii) access and equity enhancement. \nThe  Project\u2019s  main  focus  is  to  improve  the  capacity  of  TEVT \ninstitutions  to  meet  labor  market  needs  by  emphasizing  public-\nprivate  partnership,  on-the-job  training,  and  job  counseling  for \nTEVT  graduates;  and  performance-based  management  and \nmanagement  development  programs  to  deliver  TEVT  efficiently. \nTEVT  programs  will  be  improved  through  competency-based \ntraining  (CBT),  teacher  training,  provision  of  learning  resources, \nand  quality  control.  The  Project  will  support  the  rural  poor  and \nwomen  through  new  programs  and  facilities,  rural  livelihood \ntraining,  and  entrepreneurship  training  and  access  to  microcredit \nfor self-employment. \n \nNWFP  has  low  literacy  (40.0%\u201460.0%  for  males  and  21.0%  for \nfemales)  and  high  poverty  (39.8%  compared  to  32.1%  for \nPakistan). NWFP is thus developing skilled workers and creating \njobs,  especially  in  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  that  use \nindigenous natural resources. NWFP has high unemployment, yet \njob  vacancies  often  are  unfilled  due  to  lack  of  trained  personnel. \nAbroad,  demand  is  growing  for  skilled  workers,  especially  in  the \nMiddle  East  and  Malaysia.  The  TEVT  system\u2019s  internal  and \nexternal  efficiency  urgently  needs \nimprove.  Through \nconsolidation  and  strengthening  of  TEVT  programs,  and \ninvestments  to  make  the  TEVT  system  more  responsive  and \ncompetitive, TEVT trainees\u2019 job or self-employment prospects will \nimprove.  \n\nto \n\n\fObjectives  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  Project  aims  to  help  the  Government  reduce  poverty  by \nenhancing  competitiveness  of  TEVT  and  the  employability  of \ngraduates  in  line  with  market  needs.  The  Project\u2019s  specific \nobjectives  are  to  (i)  restructure  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity,  efficiency,  and  autonomy  of  TEVT  institutions;  (ii) \nimprove  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs;  and  (iii) \nenhance access to quality TEVT, particularly among the rural poor \nand women. \n \nThe Project will help DOI\u2019s Directorate of Technical Education and \nManpower  Training  (DTE&MT)  restructure  and  strengthen  its \ninstitutional capacity to provide quality TEVT. The Project will help \nTEVT  institutions  improve  their  planning  and  management  by \ngiving  them  autonomy  to  provide  quality  and  relevant  TEVT. \nTraining teachers, providing learning resources, introducing CBT, \nand  improving  quality  control  will  strengthen  TEVT  programs. \nSupporting new facilities and new TEVT programs, and providing \nlivelihood  training  will  increase  access  of  the  rural  poor  and \nwomen to TEVT. \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $15.7  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$3.7 million (24%) is the foreign exchange cost and $12.0 million \nequivalent (76%) the local currency cost. \n \n\nSource \n\nGovernment \nADB \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n0.0 \n3.7 \n3.7 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n4.7 \n7.3 \n12.0 \n\n($ million equivalent)\n\n \nTotal \n4.7 \n11.0 \n15.7 \n\n \nPercent \n\n30 \n70 \n 100  \n\n \n    ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $11 million equivalent from the Asian Development Fund \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided.

Each  supply  contract  for  equipment  and  materials \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $500,000  will  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Each \ncivil  works  contract  estimated  at  less  than  $1  million  will  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding.  Each  supply \ncontract  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  less  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  \ninternational  shopping.  Equipment  and  textbooks  estimated,  in \naggregate,  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  directly \nprocured.  \n \nA \n(15 \ntotal  of  77  person-months  of  consulting  services \ninternational,  and  62  domestic)  will  be  used  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged individually or as a \nfirm.  A  higher  education  institution  and/or  management  institute \nwill  be  selected  and  engaged  for  the  management  development \nprogram,  performance-based  management,  and  development  of \ncompetency-based training system development. The quality- and \ncost-based selection method will be applied to select and engage \nconsulting firms.  \n \nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  include  about  11,000 \nstudents  in  38  technical  and  vocational  training  centers  (TVTCs) \nand 25 commercial colleges during the project period. About half \nthe  beneficiaries  will  be  students  enrolled  after  these  institutions \nexpand  their  capacity.  The  beneficiaries  also  include  20,000  out-\nof-school  youths  and  adults,  who  will  undergo  short-term \nlivelihood  training;  1,500  employed  workers,  who  will  upgrade \ntheir  skills;  50  staff  members,  who  will  improve  their  teaching, \neducation  planning,  curriculum  design,  and  industrial  skills;  and \n300  academic  staff  members,  who  will  upgrade  their  educational \nlevel  in  national  training  programs.  Qualitative  improvements  in \nthe  curriculum,  teaching  and  learning  methods,  and  learning \nresources  will  benefit  a  large  number  of  students  enrolled  in \nTVTCs  at  project  completion.  About  25%  of  direct  beneficiaries \nare estimated to be women, 75% from rural areas, and about 40% \nfrom poor families. \n \nThe Project will expand and improve the quality of rural TEVT to \nprovide  livelihood  programs  for  out-of-school  youths  and  adults \nwho  want  to  acquire  job  skills  and  to  start  their  own  business. \nNongovernment  organizations  will  plan  and \nthe \nlivelihood programs. Identification of training needs and trades for \nself-employment will meet local as well as outside market needs. \nTEVT graduates will be helped to access microcredit to start small \nbusinesses  and  generate  income  and  jobs.  All  these  measures \nwill reduce poverty, especially in rural areas. \n\nimplement \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n  v\n\ntheir \n\ninstitutions \n\nto  manage \n\n \nThe Project faces four possible risks: financial, institutional, policy, \nand  economic.  First,  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  expand  TEVT \nwithout  consolidating  and  ensuring  effective  services  at  existing \ntraining  institutes  could  erode  the  financial  and  technical  base  to \nsustain  these  institutions\u2019  operations.  The  Project  will  strengthen \nthe  capacity  and  autonomy  of  TEVT  institutions  and  seeks  the \nGovernment\u2019s  assurances  for  adequate  recurrent  budgets  and \nfinancial \nautonomy  of  TEVT \nresources. \n \nSecond,  TEVT  institutions  lack  the  autonomy  and  leadership  to \nmeet  labor  market  needs.  While  most  TEVT  institutions  have \ninstitute  management  committees  (IMCs)  or  center  management \ncommittees  (CMCs),  few  of  these  committees  are  active,  due  to \nweak  governance  structure,  weak  role  of  principals,  and  lack  of \nincludes  a \ntime  among  committee  members.  The  Project \nmanagement  development  program  and  performance-based \nmanagement  system  (PBMS)  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nprincipals, teachers, and staff of TEVT institutions. \n \nThird,  while  the  federal  policy  is  to  improve  the  TEVT  quality, \nmanagement, and financing, the policy cannot be realized without \nlinking  TEVT  institutions\u2019  performance  with  improvement  plans, \ntargets,  and  policy  stipulations.  The  Project  aims  to  increase \nTEVT  institutions\u2019  efficiency  and  effectiveness  through  innovative \nmeasures such as a quality assurance and accreditation system, \nPBMS,  examinations,  and  reform;  and  seeks  Government \nassurances  to  align  key  provincial  TEVT  policies  with  federal \npolicies. \n \nFourth,  the  economy  is  not  growing  fast  enough  to  absorb  more \ngraduates  from  TEVT  institutions.  To  remedy  this,  the  Project \nsupports  much  greater  involvement  of  the  private  sector  through \nIMCs,  CMCs,  production  units,  guidance  counseling,  and  more \norganized labor market information. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Restructuring of Technical Education and Vocational \nTraining System Project (North-West Frontier Province). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nA. \n \n2. \nIn  the  1980s  Pakistan  enjoyed  strong  economic  growth  averaging  6.5%.  However,  it \nslowed  down  to  4.6%  in  the  1990s.  Key  social  indicators,  particularly  for  education,  also \nstagnated,  unlike  in  other  countries  at  similar  levels  of  development.  The  economy,  however, \nstarted  recovering  from  FY2003,  when  growth  rate  was  5.1%.  Growth  further  strengthened  in \nFY2004,  with  the  growth  rate  estimated  at  6.4%.  To  achieve  the  targets  of  the  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), annual economic growth rate should be sustained at above \n6%, particularly since the population growth rate has remained high.  \n \n3. \nThe  provincial  government  of  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  (PGNWFP)  faces  dual \nproblems  of  high  illiteracy  and  high  incidence  of  poverty.  The  average  literacy  rate  of  the \npopulation 10 years and above is 38.0% (57.0% for males and 20.0% for females), and the net \nprimary school enrollment rate in 2001 was about 51% (61% for males and 41% for females). \nThe difference in literacy rates is marked between genders, and between urban (58%) and rural \n(37%)  areas,  although  most  people  (75%)  live  in  rural  areas.  Gross  enrollment  for  boys  was \nhigh at 110%, compared to only 63% for girls. About 58% of the students entering grade 1 reach \ngrade 10 after repeating several grades, indicating that many children leave school without skills \nand knowledge.  \n \nThe  poverty  headcount  for  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  is  about  39.8%, \n4. \ncompared  to  32.1%  for  Pakistan. Urban  and  rural  poverty  are  higher in  NWFP  than  the  entire \ncountry, leading to large variations in educational attainment among different economic groups. \nFor  instance,  net  enrollment  in  primary  education  was  only  37%  for  the  lowest  economic \nquintile, compared to 59% for the highest. Poverty increased rapidly during the 1990s because \neconomic  growth  slowed  down  and  per  capita  income  increased  only  negligibly.  Poverty  also \nincreased because of (i) limited job growth and absorption capacity in the formal sector; (ii) high \nlabor costs in the formal sector that lead to overexpansion of a low-productivity informal sector, \nthus  lowering  informal  sector  wages;  (iii)  limited  opportunities  for  unskilled  youth  to  obtain  on-\nthe-job  training  and  skills;  and  (iv)  low  quality  of  social  services,  particularly  in  education  and \nhealth. \n \nPakistan\u2019s  labor  force  grows  at  over  2%  per  annum,  while  employment  grows  much \n5. \nmore  slowly.  The  official  unemployment  rate  is  5.4\u20135.9%,  while  the  underemployment  rate, \nthose  working  less  than  35  hours  a  week,  is  about  12.0%.  The  situation  is  much  worse  in \nNWFP, with a 13% (17% for females) unemployment rate and a 41% labor force participation \nrate (17% for females). Most workers are self-employed or unpaid family  workers, while wage \nearners account for less than one third of the labor force. Of urban unemployed youths 10\u201324 \nyears old, most are either illiterate or with qualifications below grade-10 pass. The Government \nis  thus  developing  skilled  workers  and  creating  jobs,  especially  in  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  that  use  indigenous  natural  resources.  Abroad,  demand  is  growing  for \nskilled workers, especially in the Middle East and Malaysia. The Project will reduce poverty by \nproviding  access  to  quality  technical  education  and  vocational  training  (TEVT)  programs, \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nespecially  in  rural  areas  and  for  women,  and  help  TEVT  graduates  access  credit  for \nemployment or self-employment in SMEs. \n \n6. \nThe  TEVT  subsector  comprises  12  polytechnics  (1  for  women),  with  about  5,500 \nstudents (205 women) and about 450 teachers, and 38 technical and vocational training centers \n(TVTCs,  11  for  women),  with  about  3,200  students  and  about  390  teachers.  Local  jobs  are \nlimited although NWFP has been able to take advantage of the market abroad. Given the low \nparticipation  rate  in  general  education,  low  completion  rates  at  the  primary  and  secondary \nlevels, and a large TEVT subsector dominated by the public sector, PGNWFP will have to adopt \na  two-pronged  strategy:  (i)  improve  general  school  education  as  a  priority,  with  focus  on  girls \nand rural children; and (ii) provide selective support to training programs given that many youths \nlack  the  skills  to  seek  jobs.  As  general  education  improves,  support  for  TEVT  will  shift  to \npractical aspects of training, since core life skills are expected to come from general education. \nHowever, until then, TEVT will have to focus on formal and nonformal programs to complement, \nand not substitute for, general education. This approach benefits the poor, who need a second \nchance at developing life skills. TEVT must be viewed holistically to fill in gaps in the context of \noverall educational needs. \n \n7. \nThe  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  development  assistance  to \nPakistan, as articulated in the Country Strategy and Program 2002\u20132006,1 focuses on poverty \nreduction  through  sustainable  pro-poor  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  and  good \ngovernance.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  also  highlights  the  need  for  comprehensive  human  development \nstrategies, devolution of services for human development, and education reforms for quality. In \nparticular, ADB supports the Government\u2019s Education Sector Reforms Action Plan, linked with \ndevolution  to  promote  public-private  partnerships.  ADB  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  move \naway from Government and umbrella projects to focused, provincial ones. ADB\u2019s strategy is in \nline  with  the  Government\u2019s  National  Education  Policy,  Education  Sector  Reforms  Action  Plan, \nand PRSP\u2014all of which stress the role of technical education in producing skilled workers and \ntechnicians. The Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan of 2001\u20132011 points out that options \nare  still  limited  for  technical,  commercial,  and  vocational  education,  and  sets  as  a  priority  the \nintroduction of technical education at the secondary and postsecondary levels. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nDespite progress made, TEVT still faces several challenges and constraints. Appendix 1 \nprovides  the  project  framework,  Appendix  2  the  problem  tree,  and  Appendix  3  a  brief  sector \nanalysis. Some key issues and opportunities are discussed in the following sections.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n9. \nWeak  Institutional  Capacity.  The  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  and  Manpower \nTraining  (DTE&MT)  is  responsible  for  planning,  coordination,  and  supervision,  as  well  as \nresearch  and  development  (R&D)  for  technical  education  at  all  levels.  Since  DTE&MT  was \ncreated only in January 2002 by combining the former Directorate of Technical Education under \nthe Department of Education with the Directorate of Manpower Training under the Department \nof  Industries  (DOI),  it  is  still  realigning  its  mission  and  strengthening  TEVT  operations  in  the \nprovince. DTE&MT\u2019s institutional capacity needs to be strengthened, particularly to improve the \nquality  of  TEVT  programs,  R&D  policy  reform,  quality  assurance,  and  linkage  between \nindustries and TEVT institutions. Capacity building for DTE&MT is crucial to enable its staff to \ncarry out its new mandate and combined functions. Research capacity needs to be improved to \nmeet  labor  market  needs  and  to  develop  skills  and  attitudes  necessary  to  get  jobs  or  self-\n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006). Manila. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nemployment. Organizational support is necessary to enable DOI to evolve an institution similar \nto the TEVT authority in Punjab. \n \n10. \nLow  Internal  and  External  Efficiency.  Internal  efficiency  of  polytechnic  programs \nremains  a  concern,  although  it  has  improved  over  the  years.  The  high  dropout  rate  wastes \nresources and must be lowered. Less than 50% of students pass external examinations.  \n \n11. \nExternal efficiency, as measured by the number of graduates who get jobs, also needs \nto  be  improved.  The  labor  market  survey  conducted  under  an  advisory  technical  assistance2 \nshowed that graduates of diploma of associate engineer (DAE) programs had spent 1\u20132 years \nlooking  for  a  job  before  they  found  one.  These  graduates  required  additional  training  of  3\u20136 \nmonths after recruitment. Finding work takes such a long time partly because the private sector \nhas few jobs, and partly because the required training and skills are mismatched (para. 12) with \nthe quality and relevance of technical education (para. 14). Entrepreneurship training could be \nintroduced to prepare students for self-employment. Job placement services should be provided \nfor  graduating  students.  Polytechnics  and  TVTCs  can  also  offer  short-term  modular  training \nprograms  for  people  who  want  to  acquire  skills  and  start  their  own  business.  Given  that  the \nGovernment encourages semiskilled and skilled workers to find work abroad, especially in the \nMiddle East, Malaysia, and other countries, TEVT must play an important role. \n\n \n\n12.  Weak Linkage with Labor Market Needs. Although demand for some traditional trades \nand technologies (electrical, electronics, and mechanical) and for new trades and technologies \n(computer,  information,  and  telecommunications)  is  expected  to  remain  high,  as  skills  and \ndemand  are  mismatched.  A  labor  market  survey  confirmed  that  (i)  not  enough  graduates  are \nbeing  produced  in  some  of  the  traditional  courses,  and  training  opportunities  in  new \ntechnologies  are  limited;  and  (ii)  even  if  the  courses  are  available,  labor  market  information  is \nlacking,  practical  training  components  limited  and  inappropriate,  and  linkages  with  industries \nlacking.  \n \n13. \nThe lack of sharing of information and resources between industry and TEVT institutions \ncreates  a  gap  between  users  and  producers  of  skilled  workers,  lowering  the  quality  of  TEVT \nprograms  and  graduates.  Students  fail  to  acquire  employable  skills.  To  forge  a  closer  link \nbetween industries and TEVT institutions, institute management committees (IMCs) have been \nestablished at polytechnics, and center management committees (CMCs) at TVTCs. However, \nthe  committees  have  not  proved  effective  in  drawing  assistance  and  cooperation  from \nindustries. The committees must be strengthened, leadership enhanced, and the resource base \nimproved.  The  committees,  which  include  large  representation  of  industries,  need  to  focus  on \nproviding  on-the-job  training  for  students,  industrial  training  for  TEVT  teachers,  and  job \nplacement services for TEVT graduates. \n \nPoor  Quality  of  Examinations.  The  Provincial  Board  of  Technical  Education  (PBTE) \n14. \ngives examinations to students in polytechnic institutes, government colleges of technology, and \ncommercial colleges; and the Trade Testing Board (TTB) to students in the 38 TVTCs. The two \nboards do not coordinate much. The examinations, given annually, are rigid in scope, content, \ncoverage,  types  of  questions,  theory-to-practice  ratio,  and  marking  procedures.  The  passing \nrate ranges from 18% for the diploma in business administration to 49% for the DAE. In 2002, \nTVTC  passing  rates  ranged  from  74%  for  machinists  to  100%  for  plumbers  and  welders.  The \nlowest  passing  rate  that  year  was  39%  for  draftsman.  The  examination  process  should  be \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Restructuring  of Technical Education  and Vocational  Education \n\nSystem. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\ninstitutions.  A  system  of \ndecentralized  and  responsibilities  delegated \nexaminations  given  at  the  end  of  each  semester  is  being  explored.  Examination  system \nimprovements  are  expected  to  enable  TEVT  institutions  to  raise  the  performance  of  students \nand prepare them for employment, thereby reducing wastage. \n\ntraining \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \n15. \nLimited  Access  to  and  Options  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training. \nAlthough a reasonable network of training facilities is available in various parts of the province, \naccess  to  quality  TEVT  programs  remains  limited,  especially  for  the  rural  population.  Small \ntraining  centers  generally  have  poor  facilities  and  training  programs,  and  many  are  far  from \ncommunity  centers.  Traveling  to  and  from  rural  training  centers  is  difficult,  especially  for  girls. \nPGNWFP  needs  assistance  to  upgrade  the  facilities  and  improve  access  to  quality  TEVT \nprograms in rural areas. \n \n16. \nRole  of  the  Public  Sector.  The  TEVT  system  is  highly  supply  driven  and  needs  to \ndevelop  mechanisms  to  respond  to  market  needs.  TEVT  programs  can  be  improved,  and  the \nrole of PGNWFP limited to policy, planning, and monitoring and evaluation, as envisaged by the \nGovernment,  with  implementation  responsibilities  gradually  devolved  to  TEVT  institutions \nsupported by district management committees (DMCs). \n\n \n\n \n17. \nLessons  Learned.  Appendix  4  lists  lessons  learned  and  how  they  have  been \nincorporated  into  the  project  design.  The  Technical  Education  Project  (TEP)  and  an  impact \nstudy, both supported by ADB, show that TEVT institutions should be expanded cautiously, and \nconsolidated  and  strengthened.3  TEVT  institutions  should  have  resources  for  operations  and \nmaintenance  and  fill  up  all  teaching  vacancies.  High  turnover  of  project  directors  has  also \nharmed project implementation. Due to lack of information on labor market needs and absence \nof R&D, TEVT institutions have been irrelevant and unresponsive to emerging needs.  \n \n18. \nPunjab\u2019s experience in institutional consolidation (406 institutions in seven departments \nplaced under one umbrella department) and efforts to move away from Government provision of \nTEVT  to  standard  setting,  facilitation,  regulation,  and  coordination;  Sindh\u2019s  experience  in \ndevolution to the districts; and NWFP\u2019s efforts to consolidate institutions show the implications \nfor  TEVT  institutions.  While  it  is  committed  to  consolidate  TEVT  programs,  PGNWFP  should \nalso  institutionalize  strategic  planning,  policy  reform,  quality  assurance,  and  curriculum \ndevelopment, and support gradual autonomy and strong leadership at polytechnics and training \ncenters. \n \nExternal  Assistance.  While  in  the  past  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation \n19. \n(GTZ) supported technical and vocational training in the province, external support for TEVT is \ngenerally  limited.  External  assistance  to  the  education  sector  in  Pakistan  is  described  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective  \n\nA. \n \n20. \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategic  aim  of \npoverty  reduction  by  improving  the  competitiveness  of  TEVT  system  and  enhancing  the \n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1995.

Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  development  of  institutions,  (ii)  improvement  of \n\nemployment  prospects  of  TEVT  graduates  in  line  with  emerging  market  needs.  The  Project\u2019s \nspecific  objectives  are  to  (i)  restructure  and  strengthen  institutional  capacity,  efficiency,  and \nautonomy of TEVT institutions; (ii) improve the quality and relevance of TEVT programs; and (iii) \nincrease access to better-quality TEVT programs, particularly among rural poor and women. \n \n \nB. \n \n21. \nTEVT quality and relevance, and (iii) enhancement of access and equity. \n  \n \n \nThis  component  will  help  TEVT  institutions  restructure  themselves  and  to  strengthen \n22. \ntheir institutional capacity, efficiency, and operational autonomy to plan, manage, and develop \nprograms.  The  Project\u2019s  policy  implications  are  presented  under  assurances  (para.  82)  and  in \nAppendix  6.  This  component  has  three  subcomponents:  (i)  restructuring  and  strengthening \ncapacity  of  DTE&MT,  (ii)  strengthening  capacity  and  efficiency  of  TEVT  institutions,  and  (iii) \nimplementing performance-based management system (PBMS) in TEVT institutions. \n \n\nInstitutional Development  \n\n1. \n\na. \n\nRestructuring,  and  Strengthening  Capacity  of,  the  Directorate  of \nTechnical Education and Manpower Training \n\n \n\n23. \nDTE&MT  is  responsible  for  ensuring  effective  planning,  management,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision  of  TEVT  institutions.  DTE&MT\u2019s  capacity  and  resources  need  to  be  strengthened, \nespecially  in  R&D,  program  evaluation,  institutional  monitoring  and  supervision,  and  public-\nprivate  partnership.  The  Project  will  (i)  strengthen  the  R&D  cell  and  incorporate  it  under \nDTE&MT, (ii) implement and institutionalize quality assurance and accreditation system, (iii) and \ninstitutionalize DMC for TEVT. \n \n24. \nStrengthening  the  Research  and  Development  Cell.  The  R&D  cell  was  established \nunder the TEP4 and attached to its project implementation unit . The cell\u2019s mandate is to make \nTEVT graduates employable. The Project will strengthen the R&D cell by providing training for \ncore staff; supplying office equipment and funds for labor market surveys; and developing a full-\nfledged computerized management information system (MIS), labor market information system \n(LMIS),  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  (PPMIS).  The  R&D  cell  will  be \nincorporated under DTE&MT during project implementation. Through a competitive process the \nR&D cell will identify research and academic institutions to conduct research. \n \n25. \nInstitutionalizing  Quality  Assurance  and  Accreditation  System.  To  strengthen \nDTE&MT\u2019s registration system and improve the quality of TEVT programs in public and private \nTEVT  institutions,  the  Project  will  help  DTE&MT  (i)  establish  a  quality  assurance  and \naccreditation  system;  (ii)  strengthen  and  institutionalize  the  registration,  monitoring,  and \nassessment of TEVT institutions throughout the province; (iii) develop accreditation standards; a \nquality  assurance  system;  and  mechanisms,  including  criteria,  guidelines,  manuals,  and \ninstruments, to assess and improve the quality of TEVT programs; and (iv) provide equipment, \ntraining, and seed money to implement the system in public and private TEVT institutions. The \nProject will support training for staff of polytechnics and TVTCs to establish an internal quality \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  1995.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nassurance  unit.  The  Project  will  also  fund  DTE&MT  to  strengthen  quality  assurance  and \naccreditation, testing and certification, policymaking, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n26. \nEstablishing  a  District  Management  Committee.  The  Project  will  help  establish  and \ninstitutionalize a DMC for each project district. The Project will provide modest funds to support \nthe  DMC\u2019s  activities  at  the  beginning.  The  DMC,  comprising  representatives  of  industries, \neducation  institutions,  and  the  community  will  promote  collaboration  between  local  industries, \nthe  community,  and  institutions  to  mobilize  resources  and  support  from  the  private  sector  for \nTEVT institutions. The DMC  will coordinate with IMCs and CMCs to help link the polytechnics \nand training centers with industries at the district level.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening  Capacity  of  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining Institutions \n\n \n27. \nTEVT  institutions  have  limited  capacity  and  autonomy  to  plan,  develop,  and  manage \ntheir  programs  and  operations,  especially  course  offerings  and  curriculum  development, \nrecruitment  and  hiring  of  teachers,  staff  development  programs,  financial  control  and \naccountability,  and  examinations.  The  Project  will  support  an  institution-based  management \nsystem to enhance the capacity, autonomy, effectiveness, and efficiency of TEVT institutions to \nplan and manage their own affairs. In particular, the Project will (i) strengthen the capacity and \nresources  of  IMCs  and  CMCs,  (ii)  implement  management  development  programs  (MDPs)  for \nprincipals and key staff members, and (iii) implement a PBMS in TEVT institutions. \n \n28. \nStrengthening Committee Capacity and Resources. The Project will support IMC and \nCMC operations in all TEVT institutions. The composition, structure, roles, responsibilities, and \nmechanisms to make the committees more effective will be reviewed and strengthened. Modest \nseed  money  will  be  provided  based  on  the  committees\u2019  proposals.  Committee  members\u2019 \ncapacity  will  be  strengthened.  A  consultant  will  help  prepare  procedural  manuals  and \nhandbooks for reference of the committees and TEVT institutions.  \n \n29. \nImplementing  the  Management  Development  Program.  Qualified  management \ninstitutions,  including  universities  and  higher-education  institutions,  will  be  invited  to  propose \nways  to  implement  the  MDP.  It  will  strengthen  the  capability  of  principals,  teachers,  and  key \nTEVT  officials  to  assume  more  responsibilities  and  autonomy  in  planning,  management,  and \neffective  resource  mobilization  and  use.  The  MDP  will  include  market  and  competitiveness \nanalysis \nfinancial  planning  and  management,  performance \nimprovement,  institutional  development,  proposal  preparation  and  project  implementation,  and \ntraining program evaluation. The Project will provide support to TEVT institutions based on their \ninstitutional development plans.  \n  \nImplementing  Performance-Based  Management  System.  To  promote  accountable \n30. \nand  efficient  TEVT  management,  the  Project  will  implement  PBMS  in  all  project  institutions. \nTEVT institutions will be required to prepare a 5-year institutional development plan as a basis \nfor  budgetary  allocations.  Indicators  such  as  enrollments,  number  of  poor  students  in  the \nprograms,  dropout  and  pass  rates,  and  employment  of  graduates,  to  be  developed  as  part  of \nthe  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  System  (PPMES),  will  be  used  to  assess \nproject  institutions\u2019  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  The  Project  will  provide  funds  to  develop \nguidelines,  criteria,  and  operation  manuals  to  implement  the  system.  The  Project  will  also \nprovide  a  block  fund  as  an  incentive  to  project  institutions  producing  the  best  results.  Such \ninstitutions  may  subsequently  develop  into  centers  of  excellence.  Gradually,  TEVT  institutions \nwill  develop  the  capacity  to  manage  their  own  operations  autonomously.  PGNWFP  will  issue \n\nfor  demand-based \n\ntraining, \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ndirectives  to  institutionalize  the  PBMS,  which  will  be  tied  to  budgetary  allocations  after  project \ncompletion.  The  services  of  a  management  institution  or  firm  as  part  of  the  MDP,  and  a \nconsultant will be provided to develop and implement the PBMS. \n \n \n\nImprovement  in  Quality  and  Relevance  of  Technical  Education  and \nVocational Training \n\n2. \n\n \n31. \nThis  component  will  help  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs  in  12 \nexisting  polytechnics  and  40  TVTCs  (38  existing  and  2  new)  by  (i)  introducing  competency-\nbased  training  (CBT)  system  development  and  examination  reform,  (ii)  supporting  facility \nupgrading and learning resource development, and (iii) improving relevance of TEVT programs \nthrough innovative schemes.  \n \n\na. \n\nCompetency-Based Training System Development and Examination \nReform  \n\n \nCompetency-Based  Training  System  Development.  The  Project  will  help  develop  a \n32. \nframework and mechanisms for introducing the CBT system in TEVT institutions to support the \nacquisition  of  skills,  knowledge,  and  work  attitudes  required  by  industries.  Teachers  will  be \ntrained to prepare lessons, instructional materials, and learning modules in the CBT format, to \nhelp  students  practice  and  acquire  the  needed  skills.  Each  project  institution  will  nominate \ncourses  in  technologies  and  trades  to  be  converted  into  the  CBT  format  for  project  funding. \nEach technology and trade will convert at least one course into the CBT format. Project funds \nwill  be  made  available  through  the  project  institutions  for  teachers  who  submit  proposals  to \ndevelop  lessons  and  instructional  materials  and  learning  modules  and  packages  in  the  CBT \nformat. An institution will be selected to train teachers, coordinate development, implementation, \nand monitor the CBT system. Social marketing programs will be funded to raise awareness of \nprincipals, teachers, students, and the public of the CBT system. The Project will help introduce \nthe  CBT  system  gradually  in  TEVT  institutions  through  incentives  and  active  participation  of \nteachers and institutions. \n \n33. \nExamination  Reform.  PBTE  conducts  annual  examinations  for  DAE  students  at \npolytechnics  and  commercial  colleges,  and  TTB  does  the  same  at  TVTCs.  Examination \npractices  are  inflexible  and  do  not  encourage  students  to  acquire  the  skills  required  by \nindustries.  The  Project  will  develop  an  operational  framework  and  manual  to  increase  TEVT \ninstitutions\u2019 autonomy and responsibility to conduct CBT-format skill tests. Teachers will train to \nprepare reliable and valid skill tests and practical examinations. The Project will also help PBTE \nand TTB, based on their proposals, improve the quality of examinations, training of examiners \nand paper setters, examination item bank, and examination management system; and provide \noffice equipment and materials to computerize the TTB examination system. \n \n\nb. \n\nQuality Improvement through Facilities Upgrading and  \nLearning Resource Development \n\n \nConstruction of New Facilities for Five Technical and Vocational Training Centers \n34. \nfor  Girls.  Of  the  38  TVTCs,  11  are  for  girls;  of  these,  8  are  in  old  rented  facilities,  mostly  far \nfrom  community  centers.  The  Project  will  help  construct  new  facilities  for  five  TVTCs  in  major \ntown  centers  and  will  provide  equipment,  instructional  materials,  staff  training,  and  furniture. \nThese TVTCs will serve the rural population. \n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nUpgrading  of  Equipment  in  26  Technical  and  Vocational  Training  Centers.  The \n35. \nProject  will  provide  new  and  additional  training  equipment  and  furniture  in  the  remaining  6 \nTVTCs for girls and in 20 for boys. Three TVTCs for girls and three for boys will be designated \nas  \u201cmodel  training  centers\u201d  in  locations  with  potential  for  development.  The  centers  will  offer \nhigh-quality training not only in modern trades but also in traditional arts and crafts using natural \nresources  such  as  marble,  wood,  and  other  materials.  Programs  that  increase  the  value  of \nagricultural  products,  such  as  food  preservation  and  food  technology,  will  be  introduced.  The \ncenters  will  also  help  promote  cultural  heritage,  increase  the  value  of  natural  resources,  and \ngenerate income for communities. \n \n36. \nUpgrading  of  Three  Polytechnics  to  Centers  of  Excellence.  To  meet  industries\u2019 \nneeds  and  prepare  highly  qualified  technicians  for  industries,  three  polytechnics  will  be \nupgraded  to  centers  of  excellence  in  specialized  areas.  The  schools  will  be  provided  with \nequipment,  laboratories,  and  workshops  for  one  new  program  in  either  telecommunications  or \nmechatronics (computerized system of production) as well as additional equipment to upgrade \none  program  that  is  in  demand  by  industries.  These  centers  of  excellence  will  be  required  to \nprepare  an  institutional  development  plan  on  use  of  the  new  technology  and  upgrading  of  the \nprogram, costs involved, staff development, recruitment and hiring of additional staff, curriculum \ndevelopment, and equipment lists, among others, for approval by DTE&MT before project funds \ncan be released to the institutions. \n \n37. \nIntroduction of Mining Technology Program. Mineral resources abound in NWFP. To \nsupport  PGNWFP\u2019s  plan  to  expand  the  mining  industry,  an  instructional  program  in  mining \ntechnology  will  be  offered  at  one  polytechnic  near  mining  sources.  The  Project  will  provide \nmodest civil works, laboratories, workshops, equipment, teaching staff, and staff training. \n \n38. \nUpgrading  of  Computer  Laboratories  in  22  Commercial  Colleges  and  2  Training \nCenters.  Commercial  colleges  and  training  centers,  which  offer  a  diploma  and  bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in commerce, are popular among graduates aspiring for service sector jobs. Since most \ncolleges  have  too  many  students,  many  offer  evening  shifts.  All  the  students  must  take \ncomputer courses. However, as computer facilities are inadequate, training quality is poor. The \nProject  will  improve  the  quality  of  computer  training  at  22  commercial  colleges  and  2  training \ncenters by providing computers, software, and other training equipment.  \n \n39. \nDevelopment of Learning Resource Centers. To support the CBT system and to allow \nteachers  and  students  to  pursue  self-learning,  a  learning  resource  center-cum-library  will  be \nestablished  at  all  polytechnics  and  TVTCs.  The  Project  will  provide  computers,  software, \nmultimedia  packages,  books,  and  journals.  Where  library  space  is  inadequate,  the Project  will \nprovide modest support for extra space with furniture.  \n  \n\n \n\nc. \n\n \n\nImproving  Relevance  of  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTrainings through Innovative Schemes \n \n\n40. \nThis  subcomponent  will  introduce  innovative  schemes  to  make  TEVT  graduates \nemployable.  The  Project  will  introduce  an  entrepreneurship  training  program  in  TEVTs  in \npartnership with the private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). A consultant will \nhelp  develop  curriculum,  textbooks,  manuals,  and  instructional  materials  in  CBT  format  for  all \nTEVT  institutions.  The  entrepreneurship  training  modules  will  be  mandatory  for  all  TEVT \nstudents.  Teachers  will  train  to  conduct  the  program  using  the  materials  prepared  under  the \nProject.  To  help  TEVT  graduates  start  their  own  business,  the  Project  will  involve  the  same \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nconsultant  along  with  experienced  private  sector  institute  and/or  NGOs  to  facilitate  access  to \ncredit by graduates. \n \n41. \nThe Project will support on-the-job training to enable students to acquire relevant skills, \nknowledge,  work  discipline,  and  industrial  and  work  experience.  The  scheme  will  also  foster \ncooperation  between  TEVT  institutions  and  the  private  sector.  The  IMCs  and  CMCs  will  help \nestablish linkages and operational mechanisms with local industries to support this scheme. The \nProject  will engage  an entrepreneurship  and  microcredit  specialist  to  help  develop  operational \nguidelines, mechanisms, and procedures to ensure effective implementation of the scheme.  \n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  recently  reestablished  employment  exchange  program  at \nDTE&MT  with  a  network  of  nine  employment  exchange  centers  based  at  the  training  centers. \nThe  Project  will  provide  equipment,  support  for  staff  at  DTE&MT  and  employment  exchange \noffices,  and  staff  development  programs.  The  Project  will  provide  furniture,  equipment,  and \ncareer  guidance  materials  at  career  guidance  and  job  placement  centers  at  all  TEVT \ninstitutions.  A  staff  member  will  be  trained  as  a  career  guidance  and  job  placement  officer, \neither  full  or  part  time.  With  the  support  of  the  CMC/IMC,  the  center  will  liaise  regularly  with \nindustries to obtain information about job openings and provide career guidance and counseling \nservices  to  TEVT  students.  The  center  will  maintain  a  database  on  local  industries,  job \nopenings,  job  placements,  and  employment  records  of  TEVT  graduates,  and  maintain  and \nupdate it regularly. A career guidance and job placement specialist will help do this. \n \n43. \nThe  Project  will  help  establish  a  production-cum-service  center  in  partnership  with  the \nprivate  sector  in  selected  TEVT  institutions.  The  center  will  accept  work  orders  for  production \nand  provide  services  to  internal  and  external  clients.  The  management  of  the  unit  will  be \ncontracted out to qualified private institutions or NGOs that are willing to engage teachers from \nTEVT  institutions  and  train  the  students  on  a  profit-sharing  basis.  The  students  will  be  given \nallowances for their work at the center. TEVT institutions will be allowed to retain a share of the \nincome.  The  Project  will  provide  facilities,  equipment,  furniture,  staff  development,  and  seed \nmoney  for  the  center  and  support  its  initial  operations.  It  is  expected  to  become  self-sufficient \nand will be managed independently as a business unit. \n \n\n3. \n\nAccess and Equity Enhancement \n\n \n44. \nThis component will increase access to TEVT by the rural poor and women, especially \nthose  who  cannot  obtain  skill  training  in  TEVT  programs.  This  component  covers  three  key \nareas:  (i)  introduction  of  equivalency  and  certification  system,  (ii)  implementation  of  nonformal \nlivelihood skills improvement programs at TVTCs, and (iii) establishment of two VTCs for girls in \nChittral and Karak. \n \n\na. \n\nIntroduction of Equivalency and Certification System \n\nto  obtain \n\ntechnical  qualifications \n\nTo  help  workers  who  want \n\n \n45. \nthrough  external \nexaminations, the Project will establish an equivalency and certification system for a nonformal \nsystem  with  mechanisms  for  skill  assessment  based  on  CBT  standards.  The  system  will  give \nqualifying  credits  and  issue  trade  certificates  to  students,  trainees,  and  workers  who  pass  the \nexternal  examinations  and  assessments.  The  equivalency  system  will  allow  those  who  have \nstudied  before  to  continue  their  studies,  and  skilled  workers  to  obtain  formal  qualifications \nabroad.  DTE&MT  will  be  responsible  for  developing,  implementing,  and  institutionalizing  the \nequivalency and certification system for all TVTCs. Selected training centers will be designated \nas  skill  assessment  centers.  The  Project  will  provide  them  with  consultancy  services, \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\ninfrastructure, equipment, and materials. Social marketing activities will increase awareness and \nacceptance of the equivalency and certification system among the students and the public.  \n \n\nb. \n\nImplementation of Nonformal Livelihood Skill  \nImprovement Programs \n\n \n46. \nNonformal training programs of DTE&MT to improve livelihoods and provide employable \nskills  to  about  20,000  out-of-school  youths  and  adults  (at  least  50%  women)  will  be  provided \nlargely through competitively selected NGOs. Polytechnics and TVTCs can also compete for the \nfunds  and  may  choose  to  partner  with  NGOs.  Subjects  and  topics  will  be  based  on  the \ncommunities\u2019  needs  and  on  jobs  in  the  areas.  Course  duration  will  be  flexible  but  normally \nshorter than the standard training programs. Course fees will be minimal to ensure some cost \nrecovery  and  enable  the  poor  to  acquire  skills.  To  be  eligible  for  funds,  TEVT  institutions  and \nNGOs will conduct a situation analysis with stakeholders and potential trainees to plan livelihood \ntraining  programs  on  farm  and  nonfarm  activities  for  the  poor.  After  the  analysis,  the  TEVT \ninstitutions and NGOs will submit a proposal to conduct nonformal livelihood training programs \nto  the  project  management  unit  for  approval  and  funding.  Livelihood  training  programs  will  be \nintroduced to remote communities and the rural poor. Funding will be based on the duration of \nthe course, number of trainees, and other criteria. TEVT institutions offering nonformal training \nprograms  will  be  allowed  to  retain  and  use  the  money  from  the  Project,  and  the  fees  to \nsupplement their regular budgets. The programs could eventually be made a regular feature of \nTEVT institutions as outreach and community services and to promote jobs for the poor. \n \n\nc. \n\nEstablishment of Two Technical and Vocational \nTraining Centers for Girls  \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n47. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  construction  of  two  TVTCs  for  girls  in  Chittral  and  Karak, \nwhich do not have training facilities. The tourism and food industries, especially, in these remote \ndistricts could hire many skilled workers. The centers will be provided with basic infrastructure, \nequipment, furniture, a learning resource center, and instructional materials similar to those to \nbe provided to other TVTCs.  \n \nC. \n \n48. \nThe Project will help NWFP strengthen TEVT institutions and to meet the needs of the \nmarket  and  of  women  and  rural  poor.  Existing  investments  will  be  maximized  by  filling  all \nteacher vacancies, providing in-service training to teachers, improving quality and relevance of \nprograms,  and  allocating  adequate  budget  for  basic  operations  and  maintenance  and \nfunctioning of TEVT institutions before embarking on any large-scale expansion.  \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  TEVT  institutions\u2019  efficiency  by  giving  them  autonomy  and \n49. \nimproving their management and instructional leadership, promoting partnership with the private \nsector  to  run  evening  classes  and  production  units,  and  supporting  performance-based \nmanagement.  This  approach  is  necessary  to  move  away  from  a  supply-  to  a  demand-driven \nTEVT system. \n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  support  TEVT  programs  for  females  and  the  poor  in  rural  areas.  It  will \nalso  explore  the  possibility  of  introducing  double  shifts  in  selected  TEVT  institutions  to  run \nprograms  for  males  and  females.  The  Project  will  support  selected  hostel  facilities  for  rural \nwomen; livelihood programs (fisheries, livestock, agriculture, food preservation, crafts, etc., and \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nCost Estimates  \n\naccess to microcredit) for rural poor and women; and engagement of NGOs to provide services \nto them. \n \nD. \n \n51. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $15.7  million  equivalent,  of  which  an \nestimated $3.7 million or 24% is the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost is estimated \nat $12 million, equivalent to 76% of the total cost. Cost estimates by component are shown in \nTable 1, with details in Appendix 7.  \n \n \n\nTable 1.

A  steering  committee,  headed  by  the \nadditional chief secretary of the Planning and Development Department, has been established, \nand  include  representatives  from  DOI,  DOF,  Chamber  of  Commerce,  DTE&MT,  and  local \ngovernment.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  once  every  quarter  to  review  project \nimplementation.  It  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  policy  reforms,  addressing  bottlenecks, \nand providing overall guidance. \n \n54. \nThe  DTE&MT  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  as  it  was  for  the  TEP.  A  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  will  be  set  up  at  or  near  DTE&MT,  with  a  project  director  appointed \ncompetitively  and  supported  by  a  deputy  project  director,  accounts/disbursement  officer, \nprocurement  officer,  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer,  and  other  staff  as  appropriate  whose \nqualifications,  experience  and  expertise  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  project  director  will  be \nresponsible for the overall implementation of the Project in close collaboration with the recipient \nTEVT institutions. The PMU will organize quarterly implementation review meetings and submit \na  quarterly  progress  report  to  the steering  committee  and  ADB.  Implementation  arrangements \nare described in Appendix 8. \n \n55. \nEach district affected by the Project will establish a DMC and will assign a district project \ncoordinator to supervise and implement district-level activities. Each coordinator will seek inputs \nfrom  either  consultants  or  experts  from  PGNWFP.  The  PMU  will  provide  technical  support  to \ncoordinators.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  starting  in  April  2005,  and  will  be \n\n \n56. \ncompleted by 31 October 2010. A tentative implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n57. \nProcurement of ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil works will be carried out \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  supply  contract  for  equipment  and \nmaterials estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis \nof international competitive bidding. Each civil works contract estimated at less than $1 million \nwill be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. Each supply contract for equipment or \nmaterials estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis of  \ninternational shopping. Equipment and textbooks estimated, in aggregate, at less than $100,000 \nequivalent may be directly procured.  The indicative contract packages are in Appendix 10. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n58. \nA total of 77 person-months of consulting services (15 international and 62 domestic) will \nbe  used  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  individually  or  as  a  firm.  A  higher  education  institution  and/or \nmanagement institute will be selected and engaged for the management development program, \nperformance-based  management,  and  development  of  competency-based  training  system \ndevelopment.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  applied  to  select  and \nengage  consulting  firms.  Appendix  11  provides  indicative  terms  of  reference  and  consultancy \nrequirements. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n59. \nDOI  will,  immediately  after  the  loan  effectiveness,  establish  an  imprest  account  at  a \nbranch of the National Bank of Pakistan, Peshawar for the PMU to expedite disbursement of the \nloan  proceeds,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed \narrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  $300,000.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be \nfollowed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  account  and  reimburse  individual  payments  of  $50,000  and \nbelow. \n \n60. \nTo  expedite  preparatory  activities,  DOI  must  take  advance  action,  particularly  to  select \nand  engage  a  higher  education  institution  and/or  a  management  institute,  select  and  recruit \nconsultants,  and  prepare  bid  documents.  Retroactive  financing  of  up  to  $200,000  has  been \napproved \nloan \neffectiveness.  All  advance  action  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  PGNWFP  was  advised  that  the  approval  of \nadvance  action  and  retroactive  financing  (in  principle)  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nProject. \n \n\nfor  preparatory  activities  between \n\nloan  negotiations  and \n\nin  principle \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n61. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nproject performance report, and submit them to ADB within 30 days of the end of each quarter.  \nWithin 3 months of physical completion, the PMU will submit a project completion report to ADB. \nDTE&MT will (i) maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures financed out of the \nproceeds of the loan; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish to \nADB,  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s report. The report will include an audit with \nseparate opinion on the use of imprest account with the statement of expenditure procedure. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System  \n\n \n62. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  strengthening  MIS,  LMIS,  and  PPMES,  as  well  as  undertaking \nresearch on areas such as tracer studies of graduates and labor market surveys. During the first \nyear, the Project will help DTE&MT establish a comprehensive project performance monitoring \nand  evaluation  system  by  developing  baseline  information  on  all  TEVT  institutions,  and \ndeveloping  MIS  and  LMIS  linked  to  a  set  of  key  monitoring  indicators  indicated  in  the  project \nframework.  The  PPMES  will  help  monitor  progress  made  on  key  indicators,  and  also  help  all \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nTEVT  institutions  monitor  their  performance  against  the  indicators  in  their  institutional \ndevelopment  plan.  The  indicators  will  cover  internal  and  external  efficiency  as  well  as  quality \nand  institutional  indicators  such  as  number  of  teacher  positions  filled,  quality  of  teachers, \navailability  of  instructional  materials,  institutional  capacity,  etc.  The  PPMES  will  allow \ncomparison between the status at the time of project start-up and outputs at midterm and end of \nthe Project. TEVT annual planning and budgeting will be linked to information available from the \nPPMES. The PPMES will establish mechanisms to introduce mandatory reporting and sharing \nof  information  with  the  public.  To  ensure  effective  and  transparent  utilization  of  resources, \nPGNWFP will require the TEVT institutions to provide financial information to DMCs each year. \nAppendix 12 provides a list of key indicators and strategy for the PPMES. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n63. \nPGNWFP and ADB will jointly conduct two semiannual reviews (at least one full review). \nPGNWFP  and  ADB  will  jointly  establish  the  issues  to  be  addressed  during  each  mission,  and \nreports required. PGNWFP and ADB will carry out a midterm review of project implementation \narrangements, focusing on a few key issues, during the third year of implementation. ADB and \nPGNWFP will consider changes based on the findings of the review. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits \n\nA. \n \n64. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  consolidating  and  strengthening  existing  TEVT  programs,  and \nimproving  TEVT  institutions\u2019  capacity  to  become  more  competitive,  provide  high-quality  and \nrelevant  skills  to  TEVT  students  in  selected  technologies,  and  give  women  and  the  rural  poor \naccess to training. The Project will make TEVT more responsive to labor market needs and help \ngraduates  find  jobs  quickly  at  home  or  abroad  or  acquire  microcredit  to  start  own  ventures.  The \nProject\u2019s  staff  development  activities  will  improve  TEVT  teachers\u2019  practical  and  subject  skills. \nEnterprises  and  other  employers  will  benefit  from  the  availability  of  trained  and  skilled  workers, \nwhich will improve production quality, increase productivity, and make management more efficient. \nAll these inputs will improve the TEVT system\u2019s external efficiency by creating jobs and increasing \nearnings.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  economy,  particularly  NWFP,  by  contributing  to  long-term \nsustainable industrial, commercial, and agricultural growth.  \n \n65. \nIn  over  6  years  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  11,000  students  (about  3,000 \ngraduates)  in  12  polytechnics,  about  20,000  students  in  38  training  centers  (about  the  same \nnumber  of  graduates),  and  about  20,000  out-of-school  adults  and  women  who  will  receive \nnonformal  livelihood  training.  Other  direct  beneficiaries  include  about  450  teachers  in \npolytechnics, about 390 in training centers, and about 550 IMC and CMC members. Of the total \ndirect beneficiaries, 75% are expected to come from rural areas, about 25% will be females, and \nabout  40%  will  be  from  economically  poor  families.  Poor  communities  will  benefit  mostly  from \nthe  livelihood  programs,  but  also  from  DAE  and  trade  programs  since  most  poor  students \ncannot afford general education. \n \n66. \nThe  DAE  and  trade  programs  will  benefit  SMEs  in  by  introducing  improved  learning \nmethods,  resource  materials,  and  modern  equipment.  The  focus  on  practical  application  and \nlinkages with the industry for students and teachers will allow polytechnics and training centers \nto learn from industry, while giving industry skilled graduates. TEVT graduates could also work \nabroad, as many Pakistanis do, and remit the earnings. Livelihood training will give rural out-of-\nschool youths and adults job and self-employment skills. With NGO support, programs that are \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nProject Risks \n\nin  demand  can  be  provided  with  great  flexibility.  TEVT  graduates  will  be  helped  to  access \nmicrocredit  to  start  small  ventures.  All  these  measures  will  reduce  poverty,  especially  in  rural \nareas.  The  Project  also  gives  women  access  to  quality  TEVT  by  strengthening  polytechnic \ninstitutes  and  training  centers,  supporting  the  establishment  of  two  new  training  centers,  and \nconstructing facilities for five training centers for women.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  faces  four  possible  risks:  financial,  institutional,  policy,  and  economic. \n67. \nAppendix 13 identifies potential risks and proposed mitigation measures. First, PGNWFP\u2019s effort \nto  expand  TEVT  without  consolidating  and  ensuring  effective  services  at  the  existing  training \ninstitutes could erode the financial base needed to run them. The Project helps strengthen the \ncapacity and increase the autonomy of TEVT institutions and seeks PGNWFP\u2019s assurances for \nadequate recurrent budgets and notification or directive to enable TEVT institutions to manage \ntheir  financial  resources.  The  economic,  poverty  impact,  and  financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix \n14. \n \n68. \nSecond, TEVT institutions lack the autonomy and leadership to allow them to meet labor \nmarket needs. While most TEVT institutions have IMCs or CMCs, few of these committees are \neffective  due  to  weak  governance  structure  and  role  of  the  principals.  The  Project  includes  a \nmanagement  development  program  and  PBMS  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  principals, \nteachers,  and  staff  of  TEVT  institutions.  The  Project  also  supports  capacity-building  programs \nfor IMCs and CMCs, and provides modest financial assistance to make them more effective in \nsupporting TEVT institutions. \n \n69. \nThird, the quality, management, and financing of TEVT programs can be improved only \nby  improving  plans,  targets,  and  policy  stipulations.  The  Project  aims  to  implement  innovative \nmeasures  such  as  a  quality  assurance  and  accreditation  system,  PBMS,  and  examination \nreform, among others, to enable TEVT institutions to improve quality, relevance, efficiency, and \neffectiveness of their programs and operations. The Project also seeks PGNWFP\u2019s assurances \nto align key TEVT policies at the provincial level. \n \nFourth, the economy is  not growing fast enough to absorb more graduates from  TEVT \n70. \ninstitutions. Unless the private sector is engaged more actively, TEVT graduates will continue to \nhave difficulty finding jobs. The Project supports much greater involvement of the private sector \nthrough IMCs and CMCs, production units, guidance counseling, more organized labor market \ninformation, and credit facilitation for self-employment. \n \n\nEnvironment \n\n1. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  categorization  is  \"C\"  as  the  initial  screening  has  not \n\n71. \nidentified any adverse environmental impacts. \n \n\nSocial Analysis \n\n2. \n \n72. \nThe Project aims to increase equity and effectiveness of TEVT programs by supporting \ntwo training centers and providing new facilities for five centers mainly for rural girls. The focus \non  improving  quality  and  organization  of  all  TEVT  institutions  will  benefit  largely  rural  poor \nstudents. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy form is in Appendix 15. \n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \n\nAssurances.  PGNWFP has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard \n\n73. \nones, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n74. \nTo  implement  new  initiatives  and  programs  to  improve  the  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency of the TEVT programs and institutions in accordance with the national policies on the \nTEVT  subsector,  PGNWFP  commits  to  issue  within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \nfollowing binding directive(s):  \n\nTEVT  institutions  in  NWFP  will  (a)  adopt  the  CBT  system  developed  under  the \nProject  for  selective  subjects  and  courses  in  all  trades  and  technologies;  (b) \nrequire teachers of these subjects and courses to conduct practical examinations \nfollowing  CBT  principles  and  format;  (c)  develop  and  implement  on-the-job \ntraining  programs  as  an  integral  part  of  the  curriculum  for  all  technologies  and \ntrades; (d) encourage teachers to obtain industrial experience with pay as part of \nthe  ongoing  in-service  training  programs;  and  (e)  gradually  assume  more \nautonomy in the management and utilization of resources, including retention of \nrevenues to support their activities according to the PBMS to be introduced under \nthe Project. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nDTE&MT  in  collaboration  with  the  PBTE  will  (a)  develop,  implement,  and \ninstitutionalize the equivalency and certification system in NWFP to provide more \nopportunities  and  greater  access  to  TEVT  for  the  out-of-school  youths  and \nadults;  and  (b)  develop,  implement,  and  institutionalize  an  accreditation  and \nquality assurance system to improve the quality of TEVT institutions in NWFP. \n\n \n75. \nTo  ensure  continuity,  efficiency,  and  smooth  implementation  of  the  Project,  PGNWFP \nagrees  that  the  project  director  will  be  appointed  for  at  least  a  term  of  3  years.  In  case  of  an \nabsolute necessity to replace the project director, inter alia, due to unsatisfactory performance, \nPGNWFP will appoint a new one, on a competitive basis, whose qualifications, experience and \nexpertise are acceptable to ADB. \n \n76. \nTo  ensure  effective  and  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  PGNWFP  commits  that \nupon  completion  of  the  TEP,  essential  experienced  staff  of  the  TEP  will  be  transferred  to  the \nPMU. \n \n77. \nPGNWFP  will  sanction  recruitment  of  necessary  teaching  and  non-teaching  staff  for  (i) \nany new training centers before procurement of equipment for and construction of such training \ncenters;  and  (ii)  any  new  programs  contemplated  under  the  Project  before  commencement  of \nthese  programs.  PGNWFP  will  start  recruitment  of  such  staff  immediately  after  the  (a) \nestablishment of new training centers; and (b) commencement of new programs. \n \n78. \nPGNWFP  agrees  that  the  existing  R&D  cell  will  become  part  of  the  PMU.  PGNWFP \nfurther agrees that immediately after the loan effectiveness (a) the  R&D cell will be integrated \nunder DTE&MT, and (b) PGNWFP will be fully responsible for its expenses. \n \n79. \nUnless  otherwise  agreed,  PGNWFP  will  ensure  that  within  9  months  of  loan \neffectiveness each TEVT institution will develop and submit for review and approval of DTE&MT \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nPGNWFP  will  allocate  and  make  available,  in  a  timely  manner,  requisite  counterpart \n\na  5-year  institutional  development  plan  that  clearly  identifies  objectives,  targets,  staffing \nrequirements,  capacity-building  needs,  and  budgetary  requirements  to  qualify  for  civil  works, \nequipment, and other support from the Project. \n \n80. \nfunds from its budget for each fiscal year for the smooth implementation of the Project.  \n \n81. \nPGNWFP  will  ensure  that  within  11  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  to  enhance \ncompetitiveness of the polytechnics and training centers, DTE&MT will prepare for PGNWFP\u2019s \napproval a 5-year plan encompassing (i) TEVT rationalization, (ii) teacher career development, \nand  (iii)  gradual  autonomy  to  TEVT  institutions.  PGNWFP  commits  that  the  implementation  of \nsuch a plan will begin within a month after its approval. \n \n82. \nPGNWFP commits to maintain the additional recurrent costs of approximately $370,000 \nequivalent  required  annually  after  the  project  completion  on  31  October  2010  to  sustain    the \nproject investments.  \n \n83. \nPGNWFP will ensure that basic MIS and LMIS, including all baseline information, will be \nset  up  by  the  PMU  within  12  months  of loan  effectiveness, with  plans  for  further  development \nduring the project period. \n \n84. \nPGNWFP will ensure women's participation in project implementation in accordance with \nthe gender strategy set out in Appendix 15.

Elementary education is subdivided into primary (grades 1\u20135) and middle \nlevels  (grades  6\u20138).  The  secondary  level  comprises  grades  6\u201310,  and  the  higher-secondary \nlevel,  grades  11\u201312.  A  bachelor\u2019s  degree  in  general  science  or  humanities  takes  another  2 \nyears  after  higher-secondary  school,  for  a  total  of  14  years,  while  engineering  and  medicine \nprograms are longer. \n \n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Education  is  responsible  for  policy,  planning,  and  overall  educational \nstandards at the federal level. The ministry also has control over the curriculum for grades 1\u201312. \nThe  departments  of  education  are  responsible  at  the  provincial  level.  Recently,  this \nresponsibility  has  been  devolved  to  the  district  level,  where  the  executive  district  officer  for \neducation supervises and promotes education.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) has three subcomponents: school \nlevel  prevocational,  post  grade  8  level  TEVT,  and  higher-level  engineering  and  technology \neducation. The introduction and integration of prevocational and vocational courses into general \nschool education dates back to the early 1950s, and many experiments have been done at this \nlevel. However, these efforts haven\u2019t made a significant dent in general school education, which \nsince  colonial  rule  has  been  geared  to  produce  clerks  and  other  office  workers  rather  than \ntechnicians,  engineers,  and  scientists.  The  education  policy  of  1972\u20131980  suggested  a  major \nshift  from  general  education  and  emphasized  relating  education  to  the  world  of  work.  This \nresulted in the introduction of agro-technical studies (wood work, metal work, and electricity) in \nurban, agriculture in rural, and home economics in girls\u2019 middle schools in grades 6\u20138. In grades \n9\u201310  the  introduction  of  vocational  courses  such  as  agriculture,  commerce,  home  economics, \nand  industrial  arts  was  encouraged.  More  recently,  this  approach  is  reaffirmed  under  the \nNational Education Policy and Education Sector Reform Program. \n \n4. \nThe rapid growth of the TEVT subsector is due to the Government\u2019s desire to increase \naccess of rural youths and women to TEVT to improve their job skills and means of livelihood. \nThe lack of places in the universities also led to further expansion of the subsector, as it became \nan alternative channel for the youth and school leavers. This increased demand for TEVT.  All \nthrough the years, the Government was mainly responsible for providing TEVT to youths, with \nlittle  private  sector  participation.  Only  during  the  last  few  years  has  the  private  sector  been \nencouraged  to  provide  TEVT,  through,  for  example,  incentives  under  the  Education  Sector \nReform Program. \n \n5. \nVocational  Training.  Vocational  training  caters  to  unemployed,  unskilled  youths  and \nthose who either drop out of school or fail to qualify for admission to the polytechnic institutes \nand  colleges.  Vocational  training  expanded  in  1980\u20131990,  when  several  training centers  were \nestablished and number of old ones upgraded. The Ministry of Youth Affairs also established 20 \nyouth vocational centers. The National Training Ordinance in 1980 expanded vocational training \nand established the National Training Board and provincial training boards to improve vocational \ntraining, start training women in nontraditional trades, and closely involve employers in planning \nand administering vocational training.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n  \n\n \n\n6. \nThe  duration  of  and  entry  qualifications  for  different  vocational  training  programs  vary \nwidely. Training programs range from a few weeks to 2 years, and entry qualifications vary from \nmiddle- to secondary-school pass. With 80% practice and 20% theory, vocational courses are \nmore  practical  than  technical  education.  Graduates  are  expected  to  perform  semiskilled  and \nskilled jobs in various sectors or to be self-employed. \n \n7. \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP) has 38 technical and vocational training centers: \n12 vocational training centers for boys, 15 government technical and vocational centers, and 11 \ngovernment  vocational  training  centers  for  women.  These  centers  offer  training  in  17  trades. \nExcept  for  a  few  well-established  training  centers  such  as  the  government  technical  and \nvocational center in Peshawar, with about 850 trainees in 11 trades in day and evening shifts, \nmost are small and offer traditional trades, ranging from 6 months to 1 year. Thirteen of these \ntraining centers (eight for girls and five for boys) are in rented houses or old facilities and have \nlimited  training  capacity  and  equipment.  While  facilities  are  limited,  instructional  materials  are \neven scarcer. A training cost analysis in 2001\u20132002 showed that each girl trainee was provided \na  total  of  PRs41  for  instructional  materials,  compared  to  Rs158  for  boys.  In  2002,  3,752 \nstudents enrolled in the centers\u2014506 for diplomas and 3,246 for certificates. The centers had \n389 teaching staff members. \n \n8. \nTechnical  Education.  Technical  education  refers  to  postsecondary  training  of  middle-\nlevel supervisory technicians carried out in polytechnic institutes. These technicians serve as a \nlink between engineers and technologists on the top and skilled and semiskilled workers below \nthem.  The  rapid  growth  of  the  TEVT  subsector  was  the  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  desire  to \nincrease  access  of  rural  youth  and  women  to  TEVT  to  improve  their  job  skills  and  means  of \nlivelihood. The lack of places in universities also led to expansion of the subsector, as it became \nan alternative channel for the youth and school leavers. This resulted in increasing demand for \nTEVT.  \n \nA  three-year  course  leading  to  a  diploma  of  associate  engineer  (DAE)  is  the  main \n9. \npolytechnic program. The curriculum comprises 60% practice and 40% theory. The polytechnic \ninstitutes offer a wide range of training in traditional as well as new and emerging technologies. \nThe  bigger  institutes  offer  up  to  eight  technologies.  NWFP  has  12  polytechnics,  with  about \n4,500 students and 450 teachers. For a province with over 20 million people, this is inadequate, \nand much fewer women enroll than in Punjab and Sindh. \n \n10. \nDAE holders\u2019 persistent demand for extension of facilities to higher education resulted in \nthe introduction in the late 1970s of the bachelor\u2019s degree in technology (B. Tech.) throughout \nthe  country.  The  B.  Tech  (pass  course)  is  two  years\u2014one  year  on  the  job  and  one  year \nteaching; and the B. Tech. (honors) is two years\u2014one year on the job and one year schooling. \nFor offering a B. Tech program, a number of polytechnic institutes were upgraded to colleges of \ntechnology.  The  program  is  offered  only  by  colleges  of  technology  through  affiliation  with  a \nrecognized university in the province. This initiative is considered important as it (i) allows DAE \ngraduates  to  train  further;  and  (ii)  upgrades  DAE  teachers\u2019  qualifications,  as  about  50%  have \nonly DAEs. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance,  Structure,  and  Management  of  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining \n\n \nIn NWFP the Government has initiated major structural changes in TEVT system. First, \n11. \nthe  directorates  of  technical  education  and  of  manpower  training  were  merged  into  the \nDirectorate of Technical Education and Manpower Training (DTE&MT) at the beginning of 2002 \nunder  the  Department  of  Industries  (DOI).  Then  in  September  the  TEVT  Authority  was \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n  25\n\nDemand and Supply of Skilled Workers and Technicians \n\nRestructuring can be complicated, needing political will. Massive support will be needed \n\nestablished  as  an  autonomous  body  with  powers  to  take  over  all  polytechnics,  commerce \ncolleges, technical and vocational training centers, and similar institutes.  \n \n12. \nfor the new system to fulfill its mandate and aspirations.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nTraditionally  most  TEVT  institutions,  particularly  the  polytechnics,  were  established  to \ntrain the workforce for Government departments and public sector organizations. Until recently \nend  users  have  not  been  involved  in  the  operation,  management,  and  program  delivery,  and \ncourse  have  not  been  aligned  to  industries\u2019  needs.  TEVT  institutions  have  thus  become \nmarginalized,  with  employers  showing  little  interest  in  cooperating  with  the  institutions  due  to \nlack of interaction between them and industries.  \n \n14. \nA  labor  market  survey  conducted  in  2003  under  an  Asian  Development  Bank  advisory \ntechnical  assistance  found  that,  first,  graduates  identified  lack  of  industrial  training  skills  and \ninadequate  practical  content  as  a  key  weakness  of  TEVT  programs,  followed  by  shortage  of \nequipment,  insufficient  consumables  and  learning  materials,  and  poorly  prepared  teachers. \nMost enterprises rated practical skills, troubleshooting, report writing and communication skills, \nand  safety  consciousness  as  poor.  Finally,  graduates  who  were  hired  had  to  be  trained  for  3 \nmore months by their employers. \n \n15. \nSecond,  future  demand  for  skilled  workers  and  technicians  is  high  in  electrical, \nmechanical,  electronics,  computer  and  information,  telecommunication  courses,  and  moderate \nin  civil  works  and  construction,  auto  and  diesel,  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning,  plastic, \nrubber, and petroleum trades and technologies. \n \nThird,  TEVT  skills  are  mismatched  with  those  required  by  the  industry  due  to  dated \n16. \ncurriculum; lack of trained teachers; shortage of funds; an inflexible training system; and lack of \ntraining in practical aspects, troubleshooting, report writing, and communication. \n \nE. \n \n17. \nSeveral  areas  need  improvement.  First,  TEVT  programs  should  be  consolidated  to \nensure  that  they  are  organized  and  managed  effectively  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  local  and \nforeign  labor  markets.  Second,  as  the  private  sector\u2019s  involvement  in  TEVT  is  limited,  the \nprovincial  government  of  North-West  Frontier  Province  (PGNWFP)  needs  to  improve  TEVT, \nparticularly  for  women  and  the  rural  poor,  through  policy  reforms,  regulation,  targeted \ninvestments,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  a  greater  role  for  nongovernment  organizations \nand the private sector. Third, PGNWFP needs to link TEVT with industry, make TEVT programs \npractical,  provide  labor  market  information  and  counseling  to  TEVT  students  and  graduates, \nemploy  performance-based  management  to  target  funds,  and  be  flexible  about  changing \nteaching  and  learning.  Finally,  TEVT  institutions  should  have  autonomy,  which  will  promote \neffective leadership and performance-based management and allow TEVT providers to become \nmore responsive and competitive. \n \n \n\nKey Issues and Challenges  \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLessons Learned \n \nProject Design and Processing \n \n1.  Stakeholders\u2019 participation in the design \nand implementation of past technical education \nand vocational training (TEVT) projects was \ninadequate. \n \n \n2.  Umbrella projects coordinated by the \nfederal Government did not solve project \nmanagement and implementation problems at \nthe provincial level. \n \n3.  Project cost estimates were not accurately \ncalculated during the Appraisal Mission. \n \n \n4.  Omissions or discrepancies in the planning \ncommission form 1 were not resolved on time, \nespecially during the Appraisal Mission.  \n \n5.  The Government could not provide \nrecurrent budgets to cover operations, \nmanagement, and maintenance of new \ninstitutions and facilities. \n \n6.  Data on demand and supply of labor \nmarkets in various industries were neither \navailable nor considered in TEVT curriculum \ndesign.  \n \n7.  Project design should include industrial \nexperience in the polytechnic curriculum as \nwell as in the preservice and in-service training \nof technical teachers.  \n \n8.  Further assistance from ADB should focus \non micro-level and institutional issues to solve \nvarious project implementation deficiencies and \ngive TEVT institutions autonomy. \n \nProject Implementation \n \n9.  Project implementation was delayed by \nweak coordination between the federal and \nprovincial governments and bureaucratic \npractices. \n \n10.  Frequent turnover of the project \nimplementation unit (PIU) project director and \nmanager delayed and impaired project \nimplementation. \n\n \n\nLESSONS LEARNED \n \nIncorporations of the Lessons in Project Design \n\n \n \n \n1.  The project design incorporates the views, needs, and \nfeedback from government agencies, private sector \nrepresentatives, NGOs, teachers, students, and \ncommunities through extensive consultations during project \nformulation. \n \n2.  The Project is province based and will be implemented by \nthe province to ensure full commitment and expeditious \nproject implementation. \n \n \n3.  Cost estimates were prepared in collaboration with the \nprovincial government and with assistance of financial \nanalysts to ensure that data are accurate and complete. \n \n4.  The draft form was prepared, discussed, and revised with \ninputs from government agencies during project \npreparations and will be reviewed during appraisal. \n \n5.  The provincial government was requested to earmark \nadequate recurrent budgets to support project activities and \nto give highest priority to provide adequate recurrent \nbudgets to project institutions and facilities. \n \n6.  A labor market survey was conducted during technical \nassistance implementation, and findings on demand-supply \nof skilled workers and technicians incorporated into the \nproject design. \n \n7.  The project design includes on-the-job training as an \nintegral part of TEVT. Technical teachers will receive in-\nservice training in industry to upgrade their skills and \nknowledge. \n \n8.  The project design incorporates components to enhance \ncapacity and autonomy of TEVT institutions to become more \nindependent in managing their programs and operations. \n \n \n \n \n9.  The provincial government will take full responsibility for \nproject implementation activities. \n \n10. A professional project director will be appointed from the \nmarket. The Government agrees that the project director will \nnot be replaced for at least 3 years. If the project director \nneeds to be replaced, the Government will seek ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence.  \n\nContinued on next page \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n 27\n\nLESSONS LEARNED\u2014Continued \n\nLessons Learned \n \n10.  Inadequate training in project \nmanagement, procurement, project accounting, \nand auditing of staff of executing agencies and \nPIU delayed and impaired project \nimplementation. \n \n11.  Inadequate supervision by ADB\u2019s review \nmissions delayed project implementation. \n \n \n \n \n12.  Delayed recruitment of teachers for new \ntechnologies and subjects due to restrictive \ngovernment regulations and lack of recurrent \nbudget to hire contractual teachers impaired \nthe new programs. \n \nProject Sustainability and Impact \n \n13.  Lack of private sector cooperation and \nsupport in operating and managing TEVT \ninstitutions results in their poor quality and \ngraduates\u2019 skill mismatch. \n \n14.  Planning, management, monitoring, and \nsupervision of the TEVT system was ineffective \ndue to lack of baseline data, benchmarks, \nmanagement information system, benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation system, and internal \nproject statistics.  \n \n15.  Lack of a social marketing campaign \nresulted in poor response and participation by \ntarget groups and beneficiaries.  \n \n \n\nIncorporations of the Lessons in Project Design \n\n \n11.  To the extent possible, experienced PIU staff from the \nTechnical Education Project will be retained, and training in \nproject management, procurement, accounting, and other \ntopics provided. \n \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s supervision of project activities will be \nstrengthened by improving monitoring and providing more \ntime and staff, increasing field visits, and involving the \nPakistan Resident Mission in project supervision and loan \nadministration.  \n \n13.  The Government is committed to remove restrictions on \nrecruitment of teachers from other provinces and to provide \nrecurrent budgets for hiring technical teachers for new \nprograms on a contractual basis. \n \n \n \n \n14.  Private sector participation and cooperation in TEVT \nplanning and operation will be improved by establishing \ndistrict management committees and strengthening institute \nmanagement and center management committees. \n \n15.  A baseline database will be established in the first year. \nA MIS, labor market information system (LMIS), and \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system (PPMES) will \nbe strengthened and institutionalized under the strengthened \nR&D cell. \n \n \n16.  A social marketing campaign will be funded to raise \nawareness of intended beneficiaries and the communities, \nespecially women and the poor. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR \n($ million) \n \n\nNo. \n\nProject \n\nApproval Date/Duration  Amount \n\nA.

The National Education Policy (1998\u20132010) stipulates 19 provisions for technical education \nand  vocational  training  (TEVT).  These  can  be  grouped  into  seven  policy  areas:  (i)  improving \nplanning, management, coordination, and institutional development; (ii) encouraging need- and \nperformance-based  funding,  cost  recovery  for  self-reliance,  and  private  sector  participation  in \nTEVT  provision;  (iii)  strengthening  evaluation,  examinations,  and  accreditation  of  TEVT \nprograms  and  institutions;  (iv)  improving  the  skills  and  qualifications  of  teachers  through  in-\nservice  training  and  provision  of  liberal  in-service  training  facilities;  (v)  regular  revision  and \nupgrading of curricula; introduction of emerging technologies, including computer education as a \ncompulsory component of technical education; introduction of a modular approach to continuing \nTEVT  education;  and  development  of  teaching-learning  resource  materials  by  TEVT  teachers; \n(vi) increasing equity and access to TEVT by establishing new institutions, conducting distance \nand continuing education, broadening the base for TEVT by introducing a new technical stream \nof  matriculation  (technical)  and  extending  opportunities  for  further  education  for  TEVT \ngraduates;  and  (vii)  improving  TEVT  quality  by  refurbishing  and  modernizing  laboratories, \nworkshops, and training equipment. \n \nB. \n \n2.  These  stipulations  directly  affect  TEVT  development  under  the  Project.  In  particular,  the \nProject  will  improve  the  quality  of  TEVT  and  expand  it  modestly  in  strategic  areas  to  (i)  train \nworkers  to  meet  industry\u2019s  emerging  needs,  (ii)  make  TEVT  graduates  more  employable,  (iii) \ndesign TEVT programs to train workers for self-employment and for industry, (iv) teach students \nrelevant technical skills and instill in them a work ethic, (v) establish an evaluation system that \nemphasizes practical skills and project orientation, (vi) promote institution-industry linkages, and \n(vii) impart employable skills through nonformal livelihood training programs. \n \n3.  Other  policy  implications  from  the  Project  have  been  incorporated  into  the  framework.  For \nexample,  resource  implications  must  be  incorporated  to  achieve  these  policies.  The  target  for \nhigher budgetary allocation by mid-term as a percentage of allocations to TEVT will be carefully \nstudied and reflected as appropriate. \n\nPolicy Reform Proposed Under the Project \n\n \n\n\fPOLICY REFORM UNDER THE PROJECT \n \n\nPolicy Reform Proposed in \nProject Design \nIntroduction of CBT to improve \nthe quality and relevance of \nTEVT instructional programs. \n\nIntroduction and \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policies on \nTEVT Subsector \n1.

The main objective of the \nmanagement development program (MDP) is to strengthen the capacity of principals, teachers, \nand  staff  of  TEVT  institutions  to  plan,  manage,  and  evaluate  their  own  operations  and \nperformance  more  effectively  and  professionally  within  the  context  of  the  5-year  institutional \ndevelopment  plan,  internal  quality  assurance,  and  performance-based  management  to  be \nintroduced under the Project. To achieve this objective a systematic and comprehensive MDP \nwill  be  implemented  under  the  guidance  and  support  of  a  premier  management  institution \nselected  through  competitive  bidding  to  provide  capacity  building  and  MDPs  in  the  following \nareas, but not limited to them: (i) labor market survey and analysis; (ii) institutional development \nplans;  (iii) \nfinancial  planning, \nmanagement,  and  monitoring;  (iv) \ninternal  quality  assurance  of  TEVT  programs;  (v) \ndevelopment  and  management  of  management  information  system  and  project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system; (vi) tracer studies and market analysis; (vi) TEVT programs \nevaluation  and  improvement;  (vii)  social  marketing  and  public  relations  programs;  (viii) \ninstitution-industry \ninstitute  management \ncommittees and center management committees; and (x) staff development plan and programs \nto  improve  the  competencies,  performance,  and  efficiencies  of  teachers  and  staff  of  the \ninstitutions. \n \nThe DOE PMU and DOLM PMU, in collaboration with the project institutions, will prepare \n16. \nan  MDP  document  including  a  program  outline,  invitation  letter,  scope  of  work,  terms  of \nreference, and evaluation criteria for selecting qualified management institutions from within and \noutside  the  province,  and  submit  their  technical  and  financial  proposals  for  implementing  the \nMDP at the project institutions. The selection will be based on the criteria for the technical and \nfinancial  proposals  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  criteria  for \nselecting an institute will include (i) knowledge of and expertise in planning and managing TEVT \nsystem and institutions in the province; (ii) similar experience of conducting and/or implementing \nMDPs for educational institutions or Government organizations; (iii) expertise and availability of \npersonnel  and  resources  in  the  areas  to  be  implemented  at  TEVT  institutions;  (iv) \nimplementation  plan  including  suitable  and  logical  timing  for  implementation  of  the  MDP \nactivities;  and  (v)  expertise,  qualifications,  and  experience  of  personnel  to  be  assigned  to \nimplement the MDP. \n\nlinkage;  (ix)  management  and  operations  of \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n41 \n\nPROJECT PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM \n\n \n1. \nThe Research and Development (R&D) Cell, to be strengthened and integrated into the \nDirectorate  of  Technical  Education  and  Manpower  Training  (DTE&MT),  with  support  from  the \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation  Division,  will  develop  and  implement  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  (PPMES)  for  all  polytechnics  and  technical  and  vocational \ntraining  centers.  This  arrangement  will  institutionalize  the  collection,  processing,  and  reporting \nand  dissemination  of  the  information.  The  R&D  cell  will  establish  a  process  of  data  collection \nfrom  the  polytechnics  and  training centers  annually  and  through  regular  surveys.  The  PPMES \nwill provide benchmarks and guidelines for monitoring and evaluating the progress, outputs, and \nimpact  of  project  activities  based  on  a  set  of  comprehensive  indicators  linked  to  the \nmanagement  information  system  (MIS)  and  labor  market  information  system  (LMIS)  to  be \ndeveloped by the R&D cell with inputs from a local expert (Appendix 11).  \n \n2. \nThe  PPMES  will  focus  on  all  aspects  of  development,  including  inputs,  processes, \noutputs,  and  outcomes  and  impact.  A  set  of  core  indicators  will  be  identified  (para.  5),  with \nfurther  disaggregation  for  monitoring  at  different  levels.  The  performance-based  management \nsystem to be introduced in all polytechnics and training centers under the Project will be based \non and guided by the PPMES. Information and data are scattered and unorganized. Basic MIS, \nLMIS,  and  baseline  information  will  be  established  during  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  and \nprogress evaluated at midterm and at the end, and annually. \n \n3. \nThe PPMES will build capacity at each polytechnic and training center for the first level \nof  detailed  monitoring  and  reporting.  Another  level  of  capacity  will  be  developed  and \nstrengthened  at  the  DTE&MT  level,  with  a  consolidated  PPMES  database  complemented  by \nresearch studies. A local expert will provide inputs in this process. \n \n4. \nAs part of the regular review of the implementation progress the steering committee will \nreview  two  sets  of  information:  establishment  and  institutionalization  of  the  educational \nmanagement information system, LMIS, and baseline information; and implementation of overall \nproject activities. The project management unit will reflect both aspects in its quarterly reports, \nwhich  the  review  missions  will  use.  Reporting  and  monitoring  will  require  sharing  mandatory \ninformation  with  the  steering  committee  and  district  management  committees  to  ensure \ntransparency. \n \n5. \nThe  PPMES  will  include  basic  MIS  information  disaggregated  by  gender  and  covering \nstatistics on students; teachers; facilities (buildings, equipment, furniture); and financing. While \neach polytechnic and training center will maintain a database with its own information, DTE&MT \nwill maintain a consolidated database on all polytechnics and training centers. The PPMES will \nfocus on the following key indicators, with baseline established during the first year, which will \nbe modified and disaggregated as appropriate: \n \n\n(i) \n\nEquitable Access and Enhanced Employability.  \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\nAbout 5% of technical education and vocational training (TEVT) graduates \nare able to access credit for self-employment. \nThe employment rate of TEVT graduates is improved by 25%. \nAverage time to get a job is reduced by 25%. \nAverage earnings of TEVT graduates are improved by 20%. \nPoor  and  female  students  have  access  to  TEVT,  including  developing \nmechanisms and targets.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \nQuality and Relevance  \n\n(ii) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n\nExamination passing rate is improved by 25%. \n\n(a) \n(b)  Qualifications,  experience,  and  skills  of  25\u201350%  TEVT  teachers  are \n\nimproved. \nEducation  standards  and  the  evaluation  system  are  improved  through \ncompetency-based training. \nFacilities and instructional materials are upgraded. \nNew  technologies  and  trades  are  introduced  to  meet  emerging  market \nneeds. \n\n(iii) \n\nInstitutional Efficiency \n\nDropout rates are reduced by 25%. \nPolicy reforms allow greater autonomy and improved management. \nThe R&D cell is integrated with DTE&MT and strengthened, with LMIS and \nMIS to improve information on and analyses of key TEVT issues.  \n\n(d)  Over  25%  of  TEVT  institutions  are  able  to  establish  linkages  with  the \n\nThis progress will be achieved during the Project (2005\u20132010), and progress achieved \n\nindustry. \n\n \n6. \nover the baseline will be established during the first year. \n \n7. \n \n\nMIS will focus on the following information: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nStudents:  number  of  applications,  admission,  enrollment,  dropout  rates, \nexamination performance, employment rates by program and gender. \nTeachers: expertise, experience, qualification, training. \nManagement  and  administration  staff:  expertise,  experience,  qualification,  and \ntraining. \nFinancing:  capital  cost  and  recurrent  cost  by  standard  budget  items,  including \nunit costs. \nFacilities:  number  of  classrooms,  workshops,  equipment,  furniture  and  their \ncondition. \n\nLMIS will focus on the following information to complement MIS and avoid duplication: \n\nDemand and supply of labor (local and foreign markets, self-employment).  \nSkills  required  (based  on  labor  market  surveys,  and  interaction  with  industry, \nprivate sector, Overseas Pakistan Association). \nLabor market trends and labor force statistics by key sector. \nInformation on job openings and types of jobs. \nInformation on apprenticeship, internship, and voluntary work. \nJob opportunities. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n8. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n43\n\nPROJECT RISKS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES \n\n \n\n \n\nTEVT institutions will not be able to \n\nTEVT administrators and staff need \n\nThe Government\u2019s recurrent budget \n\nProject Risks \n \n1. \nis inadequate to operate and maintain \nexisting and new TEVT institutions. \n \n \n \n \n \n2. \nrecruit teachers for new programs because \nof restrictive Government regulations and \ninadequate budget. \n \n \n3. \nsupport to implement a performance-based \nmanagement system and other programs \nsuch as a CBT system.  \n \n \n \n \n4. \nor unready to grant more autonomy to \nTEVT institutions to manage their own \nprograms and operations. \n \n \n5. \nVarious government agencies \ninvolved in project implementation may not \nfully cooperate with each other in \nimplementing new programs at existing \nTEVT institutions. \n \n6. \ncapacity to manage institutions and \nprograms introduced under the Project. \n \n \n7. \nnew programs, will not be able to find \nemployment. \n \n \n \n \n\nThe provincial government has weak \n\nTEVT graduates, especially those of \n\nThe Government has been unwilling \n\nMitigation Measures \n\n \n1.

Pakistan  has  562  public  technical  education  and  vocational \ntraining (TEVT) institutions, unevenly distributed across the provinces. About 85% are in Punjab \nand  Sindh,  and  the  rest  in  North-West  Frontier Province  (NWFP)  and  Balochistan.  One  TEVT \ninstitution is built for every 311,000 people in Punjab, 142,000 in Sindh, 266,000 in NWFP, and \n535,000 in Balochistan (Table A15.1). When private TEVT institutions are included, Balochistan \nlags even further behind. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Distribution of Population and TEVT Institutions in Pakistan \n \n\nPakistan \n136,372 \n562 \n77 \n253 \n232 \n\nPunjab \n78,387 \n252 \n25 \n109 \n118 \n\nSindh \n32,104 \n226 \n37 \n95 \n94 \n\nNWFP \n\n18,925 \n71 \n12 \n38 \n21 \n\nBalochistan \n6,956 \n13 \n2 \n11 \n \n\n 266,000 \nTEVT = technical education and vocational training, TVTC = technical and vocational training. \nSource:  ADB.  2003.

NWFP has about 700 enterprises, \nspecializing  in  mineral  resources  processing;  food  processing  and  woodwork;  and  chemical, \nelectrical,  and  mechanical  engineering.  The  market  survey  indicates  that  enterprises  will  need \nmore  graduates  from  polytechnics,  technical  training  centers  and  technical  and  vocational \ntraining  centers  (TVTCs),  and  short-term  training.  The  labor  force  required  for  the  local \nenterprises  has  been  supplied  by  12  polytechnics  and  38  public  TVTCs  and  95  private  TEVT \ninstitutions.  However,  TEVT  does  not  fully  cover  the  areas  and  level  of  skills  in  demand.  As \nfacilities  and  equipment  are  outdated,  TEVT  institutions  are  unable  to  provide  students  and \ntrainees  with  updated  training.  As  a  result,  the  completion  rate  is  less  than  50%,  and  the \ntransition rate from graduation to employment, 30%. \n \n3. \nInsufficient physical capacity of TEVT institutions, high internal inefficiency as a result of \nlow-quality  TEVT,  and  high  external  inefficiency  due  to  skill  mismatch  warrant  investment  in \nTEVT. While private TEVT institutions outnumber public ones, more students and trainees were \nenrolled  in  the  public  ones  in  2001  (Table  A14.2).  On  average,  one  public  TEVT  institution \nenrolls more students and trainees than a private one, making the public sector more efficient. \nAs  private  polytechnics  are  limited,  the  provincial  government  of  NWFP  (PGNWFP)  should \ninvest  in  public  polytechnics.  However,  with  greater  autonomy  and  in  partnership  with  the \nprivate sector, public TEVT institutions could become much more efficient. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \nTable A14.2: Technical Education and Vocational Training Institutions \nin North-West Frontier Province in 2001 \n\nItem \nPublic Sector \nPolytechnic Institutes \n\nTTC/TVTCs \nOther \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nPrivate Sector \n\nInstitutions (A) \n\nEnrollment (B) \n\nRatio (B/A) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n12 \n38 \n21 \n71 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n5,414 \n3,752 \n4,957 \n14,123 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n451 \n99 \n236 \n199 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPolytechnic Institutes \nTTC/VTCs \nOther \n\n \n \n \n \n \nTTC = technical training center, TVTC = technical and vocational training. \nSource:  ADB. 2003.

The Project faced two options: (i) support large-\nscale expansion, given the Government\u2019s ambitious plan of providing TEVT to the districts and \ntahsils;  or  (ii)  focus  on  ensuring  effective  functioning  of  existing  facilities  before  embarking  on \nlarge-scale  expansion.  While  large-scale  expansion  would  be  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \nperspective  plan  of  2001\u20132011  and  education  sector  reform  (2001-2005),  and  would  be \nsupported  by  the  PGNWFP,  such  an  approach  would  be  difficult  to  sustain  due  to  limited \nbudgets  available  for  essential  recurrent  expenditures  and  lack  of  effective  TEVT  institutional \nmodels.  The  Project  has,  therefore,  taken  the  middle  path  of  cautious  expansion  while \nconsolidating existing TEVT institutions, as NWFP offers significantly less access to TEVT than \nPunjab  and  Sindh,  particularly  to  women  and  the  rural  poor.  The  balance  between  cautious \nexpansion  and  consolidation  allows  PGNWFP  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  existing \nTEVT  institutions,  with  limited  expansion  in  the  most  viable  towns  and  districts,  focusing  on \nwomen and the rural poor. \n \nAn investment loan is proposed since PGNWFP is not yet ready to embark on a more \n5. \ncomplex  design.  Given  the  experience  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  under  the  two \nprevious projects for TEVT, persistent problems must be solved. First, a project approach allows \na simple design emphasizing policy reform. Second, Pakistan is trying to bring TEVT institutions \nunder one organization. Punjab is leading in this effort by bringing all TEVT activities under the \nTEVT  authority  (TEVTA),  and  other  provinces  are  watching  this  development  closely.  While \nPGNWFP  has  already  brought  TEVT  under  the  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  and \nManpower  Training  (DTE&MT)  of  the  Department  of  Industries  (DOI),  it  needs  to  consolidate \nTEVT  programs  and  improve  institutional  efficiency  before  implementing  a  TEVTA-type \narrangement.  Third,  the  devolution  policy  is  changing  many  government  services  but  not  yet \nTEVT  provision.  Therefore,  PGNWFP  should  be  encouraged  to  allow  TEVT  institutions  to \nbecome  autonomous,  competitive,  and  responsive  to  labor  market  needs.  Finally,  some \nfundamental  elements  for  making  TEVT  institutions  more  effective,  such  as  public-private \npartnership, counseling services, and exposure of teachers to industries, can be achieved under \na simple investment loan. \n \n6. \nThe  Project\u2019s  first  component  will  make  TEVT  institutions  responsive  to  labor  market \nneeds  through  autonomy,  performance-based  management,  and  management  development \nprograms.  The  second  component  will  improve  TEVT  quality  through  teacher  training  and \ncompetency-based training (CBT), which are supported by the National Institute for Science and \nTechnical  Education.  CBT  will  allow  aligning  training  with  the  needs  of  the  private  sector  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n47\n\nindustries.  The  Project  provides  materials  to  support  this  approach.  The  third  component  will \nestablish  equivalency  and  certification,  benefiting  many  trained  and  experienced  people  who \nwant further training or better-paying jobs. This component also provides opportunities to out-of-\nschool  youths  and  adults  to  seek  livelihood  training.  With  limited  support  to  new  institutions, \naccess to polytechnics and TVTCs can be increased. \n \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return. To assess the investment\u2019s economic viability and \n7. \nefficiency, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 25 years was estimated. Three major \neconomic  project  benefits  are  (i)  increased  access  to  TEVT  institutions,  (ii)  improved  internal \nefficiency, and (iii) improved external efficiency. Their impacts are presented in monetary value \nby  using  estimated  future  salary  increments5  of  TEVT  students  and  trainees  as  a  result  of \ncompleting an additional year of TEVT under the Project. \n \n8. \nIncreased access is represented by growth in enrollment due to new TEVT institutions, \ntechnologies,  and  training  programs  and  courses.  The  Project  will  allow  200  more  enrollees  a \nyear in polytechnics, 600 in TVTCs and colleges, and 10,000 in short-term training courses and \nprograms.  Polytechnic  and  TVTC  students  will  learn  the  skills  and  acquire  the  work  ethic  that \nwill increase their annual earning by $83 throughout their working life. Trainees in short courses \nwill add $9 a year to their salary throughout their working life. \n \n9. \nImprovement  in  internal  efficiency  is  measured  by  the  difference  in  polytechnics\u2019 \ncompletion  rates  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios,  assuming  that  newly  designed \ncourses  and  better  institutional  management  will  improve  delivery  of  education  and  training, \nand,  hence,  the  completion  rate.  During  the  Project,  the  completion  rate  in  polytechnics  is \nestimated to improve by approximately 20%, gradually from 46% to 55%. \n \nImproved external efficiency is measured by the difference in employment rate of those \n10. \nwho complete TEVT under with- and without-project scenarios, assuming that new educational \ncontent,  new  institutional  management  systems,  and  counseling  give  students  more  job \nopportunities. Immediately after graduation 70% of students cannot find jobs and have to  wait \nabout  1.5  years  to  be  employed.  During  the  Project,  the  graduates\u2019  employment  rate  is \nestimated  to  rise  gradually  from  30%  to  60%,  allowing  30%  of  graduates  a  year  to  generate \nincome,  which  will  benefit  the  economy  by  $1,407  (polytechnic  graduates)  and  $1,227  (TVTC \ngraduates) per year. \n \nThe Project, however, has investment, recurrent, and private and opportunity costs. It is \n11. \nestimated  at  $39.7  million.

A  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  undertaken  on  the  basis  of \n13. \nalternative  assumptions  regarding  the  extent  to  which  the  Project  will  improve  access,  and \ninternal  and  external  efficiency.  The  project  targets  are  that  10,800  additional  students  enroll7 \nper  year,  55%  more  complete  their  courses,  and  60%  fewer  are  jobless.  Alternative \nthe  \u201clow\u201d  case  representing \nassumptions  were \nimprovement 50% lower than the target, and the \u201chigh\u201d case 50% higher. In the low case, the \ntargets are reduced to 5,400 students for additional enrollment, 51% completion rate, and 45% \nemployment  rate.  For  the  high  case,  the  targets  are  increased  to  16,200,  60%,  and  75%, \nrespectively (Table A14.5). \n\ntested  by  employing  extreme  values: \n\n                                                 \n7   Comprising 200 enrollees to polytechnics, 600 to TVTCs and colleges, and 10,000 to short-term training courses \n\nand programs per year. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.5: Sensitivity Analysis \n(percent) \n\nLow Case \n \n14.1 \nIncrease in Access \n(18%) \n     Degree of Change \n13.3 \nInternal Efficiency \n(23%) \n     Degree of change \n8.5 \nExternal Efficiency \n     Degree of change \n(51%) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNormal Case \n17.2 \n \n0% \n \n17.2 \n \n0% \n \n17.2 \n \n0% \n \n\nHigh Case \n20.1 \n+17% \n21.2 \n+23% \n25.8 \n+50% \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n14. \nThe  results  indicate  that  the  Project  will  substantially  benefit  the  economy  when \nimprovement  exceeds  targets.  An  excessive  increase  in  access,  however,  may  replicate  the \ncurrent situation, where enrollment exceeds capacity, resulting in overcrowded classes and low-\nquality  education  and  training.  The  Project  is  highly  sensitive  to  external  efficiency.  A  small \ndecline in improvement in access could render the Project economically nonviable. The Project \nmust  achieve  at  least  the  70%  target  in  external  efficiency.  The  minimum  targets  required  for \neconomic  viability  are  likely  to  be  achieved  through  provision  of  sufficient  updated  training \nequipment and learning materials, and extensive job counseling and placement in each project \ndistrict. \n \n\nA. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis \n\n \n15. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  giving  young  people  opportunities  to  earn  through \ntraining,  guidance,  and  job  placement  programs.  The  direct  project  beneficiaries  are  students \nand  trainees  in  polytechnics,  TVTCs,  and  training  programs.  The  poverty  line  in  Pakistan  is \nbased  on  a  norm  of  2,350  calories  per  adult  daily  equivalent  and  minimum  nonfood \nrequirements, and approximates $160 per year8. Those who complete 1-year training in TVTCs \nwill  likely  earn  about  $166  more  than  those  without  training.  Those  who  complete  the  3-year \npolytechnic  course  will  likely  earn  about  $500  more  than  those  who  do  not.  Thus,  the  annual \nsalary  increments  due  to  completion  of  polytechnic  and  TVTC  training,  coupled  with \nemployment, will increase earning levels well above the poverty line. \n \n16. \nIn the absence of statistics, the proportion of poor students and trainees is assumed to \nbe  the  same  as  that  of  the  poor  in  the  province.  Student  selection  procedures  in polytechnics \nand  the  geographical  distribution  of  TVTCs  are  also  assumed  to  reflect  the  rural  and  urban \ndistribution of the provincial population: 17% of students and trainees were estimated to be from \nthe urban region, and 83% from the rural region in 1999, and poverty incidence was estimated \nat  31%  and  44%,  respectively,  in  2001.  About  42%  of  students  and  trainees  were  from  poor \nfamilies  in  1999\u20132001  (Table  A14.6),  so  at  least  42%  of  polytechnic  and  TVTC  students  are \nfrom poor families. \n \n\nTable A14.6: Population and Poverty in NWFP \n(percent) \n\n \n \n\nPopulation (A) \nPoverty Incidence in Region (B) \nPoverty Incidence in Province (AxB) \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Government of Pakistan. 2003.

It was established in 2003, so only 2 years of \nrecords  are  available.  The  total  recurrent  budget  for  TEVT  in  FY2004  is  PRs366  million,  of \nwhich  70%  is  recurrent  budget.  The  sector  budget  level  has  been  generally  stagnant,  slightly \nreduced in size and proportion to PGNWFP expenditure for the last 2 financial years. \n\n \nTable A14.7: Education, Manpower and Labor Management Budget FY2001\u20132004 \n(PRs in million) \n \n\nItem \nProvincial Government of NWFP \n\nDevelopment Budget \nRecurrent Budget \n\nTotal \n(Annual Growth) \n\n \n\nDirectorate of Technical Education and \nManpower \n\nDevelopment Budget \nRecurrent Budget \n\n \n \n \n \nFY = fiscal year, NWFP = North-West Frontier Province. \nNote: \n\nTotal \n(proportion to government expenditure) \n\nFY1999  FY2000  FY2001 \n \n3,995\n35,493\n39,488\n\n \n4,927\n33,001 \n37,928\n\n \n9,237   7,986 \n39,132 45,040b \n48,369  53,026 \n   10% \n\nFY2002  FY2003  FY2004 \n \n  8,909 \n48,564b \n 57,473 \n8% \n\n \n  9,305  \n47,115b \n 56,420 \n(1%) \n\n  22% \n\n  4% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n  195  \n  269 \n  464 \n  0.7% \n\n  113  \n  253  \n  366 \n   0.5% \n\nDue  to  limited  availability  of  records,  the  recurrent  budget  figures  are  from  the  original  budget,  and  the \ndevelopment  budget  was  from  http://www.nwfpfinance.com/  and  financial  records  of  DTEM.

Due  to  limited  official \nprovincial budget forecasts and plans and lack of budgetary records, the financial analysis had \nto  compare  the  total  provincial  budget  growth  rates  and  the  required  budget  growth  rate  for \nTEVT.  The  Project  is  estimated  to  incur  additional  recurrent  expenditure  at  approximately \nPRs21 million after the Project. DTE&MT\u2019s recurrent budget needs to be increased annually by \n1%  (8%  in  6  years)  during  the  Project.  Comparing  provincial  budgets,  which  have  increased \nfrom  4%  to  22%,  the  DTE&MT  budget  will  most  likely  increase  by  1%  annually  provided  DOI \nand  DTE&MT  consolidate  and  prioritize  TEVT  investments.  Although  the  provincial  budget  in \nFY2004 declines slightly, PGNWFP favors allocating budget for increased recurrent expenditure \nduring and after the Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n52\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA.  Linkages to the County Poverty Analysis   \n\nSector identified as a national \n\npriority in country poverty \nanalysis  \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\nCountry identified as a \nnational priority in country \npoverty partnership \nagreement \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nGiven the strong linkage between poverty and low level of human development as measured by the human \ndevelopment index, the Government of Pakistan sets as a major objective to \u201caccelerate GDP growth, reduce \nunemployment,  and  alleviate  property\u201d  in  its  Ten-Year  Perspective  Development  Plan  (the  Plan).  The \nGovernment\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of December 2003 recognizes education as a key \npillar for sustainable economic growth. Education is seen as key to improve the quality of life and to provide \nstudents  with  employable  skills.  In  particular,  the  Government  recognizes  basic  education  and  skills \ndevelopment as key to reduce poverty. The Plan and PRSP identify priority areas for the education sector: (i) \nimprovement  of  the  literacy  rate,  (ii)  education  for  all,  (iii)  improvement  in  secondary-level  enrollment,  (iv) \nproduction  of  higher-education  graduates  responsive  to  the  country\u2019s  socioeconomic  and  technical  needs, \nand (v) improvement of education quality. \n \nTechnical  education  and  vocational  training  (TEVT)  is  prominent  in  the  Plan  and  PRSP  as  a  strategy  to \nproduce skilled workers who will make the country competitive. The National Education Policy sets targets to \nexpand  TEVT  facilities  and  allow  more  people  to  enroll  in  quality  TEVT.  In  addition  to  establishing  more \ntechnical  institutes  across  the  country,  especially  in  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP),  where  TEVT \nfacilities  and  opportunities  are  still  limited,  the  Government  plans  to  introduce  job-oriented  education  and \ntraining in secondary schools throughout the country. To expand the skilled workforce, the Government has \nintroduced a technical stream in 1,100 high schools to increase the number of students who choose to study \ntechnical,  commercial,  and  vocational  subjects,  from  35%  to  50%  by  2011.  Facilities  at  high  schools, \ntechnical and vocational training centers (TVTCs), commercial colleges, and polytechnics are being used to \nconduct  evening  programs  for  out-of-school  youths  and  dropouts.  These  activities  directly  help  the \nGovernment reduce poverty by expanding access to TEVT. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  help  reduce  poverty  in  NWFP  by  providing  quality  and  relevant  skill  development \nprograms  and  increasing  access  to  TEVT.  The  Project\u2019s  specific  objectives  are  to  (i)  restructure  and \nstrengthen institutional capacity and autonomy of TEVT institutions; (ii) improve the quality and relevance of \nTEVT programs; and (iii) enhance access and equity to TEVT, especially for women and the rural poor. The \nProject will create jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises by giving graduates access to microcredit. \n \nTwo  new  vocational  training  centers  for  girls  will  be  established  in  poor  areas.  Five  of  the  eight  existing \ncenters for girls will receive new facilities in seven rural districts. Facilities, equipment, and training programs \nof  all  13  existing  centers  will  also  be  upgraded.  About  160  trainees  a  year  will  benefit  from  these  centers\u2019 \nprograms. Overall, 500\u20132,000 trainees will directly benefit from TEVT programs offered by centers covered \nby  the  Project.  As  about  500  polytechnic  graduates  are  expected  to  access  microcredit  to  start  their  own \nbusiness, and thus support their families and create jobs, the Project\u2019s economic impact and benefits will be \nsubstantial. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeted Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis \nIn  the  past  decade  poverty  has  increased  sharply  due  to  slow  economic  growth,  declining  development \nspending, and low agricultural outputs because of a severe drought. The proportion of the poor (those who \nconsume  2,350  calories  per  adult  equivalent  per  day,  or  an  equivalent  amount  of  PRs.  670  per  capita  per \nmonth  in  1999  value)  increased  from  26.6%  in  FY1993  to  32.2%  in  FY1999,  and  deteriorated  to  38.2%  in \nFY2003.  Rural  poverty  is  normally  higher  than  urban  poverty.  Over  three  fourths  of  the  poor  live  in  rural \nareas. Although poverty increased in all four provinces, it varied in different parts of the country. In 1998/99 \nurban  Sindh  had  the  least  poverty  (16%)  while  rural  NWFP  had  the  highest  (42%).  The  poor  are  mainly \nilliterate,  have  big  families  and  nonworking  heads  of  household,  and  lack  physical  assets  such  as  land  or \nlivestock.  Poverty  is  highest  among  households  whose  heads  are  day  laborers  in  agriculture,  construction, \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n53\n\ntrade,  and  transport.  Poverty  is  also  high  among  the  self-employed,  including  urban  street  vendors  and \nsharecroppers. \n \nBesides  the  economic  slowdown  and  negligible  increase  in  per  capita  income,  the  causes  of  poverty  also \ninclude (i) limited job growth and absorptive capacity of the formal sector; (ii) few opportunities for unskilled \nyouth to obtain on-the-job training and skills; and (iii) low quality of social services, particularly education and \nhealth services. \n \nThe  proportion  of  literate  heads  of  poor  households  is  almost  half  that  for  nonpoor  households.  Access  to \nurban jobs reduces poverty by 45%, while education and physical assets reduce it by 12% and 9%. Social \nDevelopment in Pakistan towards Poverty Reduction Investing in education and training to prepare students, \nincluding  those  who  have  not  undergone  formal  education,  for  employment  will  directly  reduce  poverty, \nespecially in villages and districts that lack education facilities. \n \nEducational  opportunities  are  limited,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  Mahbub-ul-Haq  Center  for  Human \nDevelopment  has  developed  a  broad  index  of  poverty  that  takes  into  account  deprivation  in  education  and \nhealth, in addition to income. Poverty of education opportunities consistently ranked the highest: 77% in 1970 \nand 58% in 1995. Pakistan has approximately 41 million adult illiterates, and their ranks increase every year. \nLess than 50% of rural girls 10\u201314 years old are in school, and over 30% of all children are unlikely to attend \nschool.  \n \nThe Project will rural TEVT to reach about 20,000 out-of school youths and adults who want to acquire job \nskills  or  start  their  own  business.  Nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  plan  and  implement  the \nlivelihood programs. Training needs and trades will be identified that will meet local and foreign needs. The \nProject\u2019s linkages with an Asian Development Bank-supported credit project will give TEVT graduates access \nto microcredit for small business and self-employment.  \n\n \n \n\n  No   \n  No \n\n  Yes   \n  Yes   \n\nB.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \nStakeholder Analysis: \n \nThe  Project  was  formulated  after  extensive  consultations  with  all  stakeholders,  including  the  Government, \nprovincial  government  of  NWFP,  and  key  government  agencies  responsible  for  TEVT  planning  and \nmanagement.  In  NWFP  consultations  and  discussions  were  carried  out  with  key  officials  of  Planning  and \nDevelopment  Department,  Department  of  Industries,  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  and  Manpower \nTraining (DTE&MT), and the chair of the Board of Technical Education. Consultations were also carried out \nwith administrators, teachers, students, community leaders, development partners, and the president of SME \nBank, among others, and with NGOs and representatives of public and private TEVT institutions.  \n \nNGO involvement in a situation analysis of vocational training needs and trades with potential trainees and \nlocal  stakeholders  will  facilitate  a  participatory  process  for  designing  and  implanting  TEVT  and  livelihood \nprograms.  Participation  of  various  stakeholders,  including  the  private  sector,  will  enable  the  provinces  and \nTEVT institutions to implement these activities effectively. \n\nD.  Gender and Development \nGender discrimination is a key factor associated with poverty. More women than men are poor. Women also \nhave less land and productive assets, and suffer more unemployment, discrimination in the labor market, and \nlimited access to economic options and the political process. Discrimination against women exists in almost \nall spheres of life, but is most profound in education and worse in NWFP than in the rest of the country. The \nnational  female  literacy  rate  is  only  29%  compared  to  55%  for  men.  TEVT  facilities  and  opportunities  for \nwomen are equally limited. Of the 77 polytechnic institutes in the country only 10 are for women. The number \nof  vocational  training  centers  for  girls  is  almost  equal  to  that  for  boys,  but  the  number  of  trades  or \ntechnologies offered to girls is limited, and enrollments are also lower in the training centers for girls. Apart \nfrom cultural factors, socioeconomic factors are to blame: in some rural training centers for girls, lack of public \ntransportation is a big obstacle and can prevent girls from enrolling. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nIn  NWFP,  of  the  12  polytechnic  institutes,  including  1  Government  College  of  Technology,  only  1  is  for \nwomen. Of the 38 TVTCs only 11 are for females. Of the 11 vocational training centers for girls, 8 are in ill-\nequipped  rented  facilities,  some  outside  the  main  community  centers.  Lack  of  transportation  and \naccommodation  also  discourages  girls  who  want  to  study  at  the  centers.  NWFP  intends  to  remedy  these \nproblems under the Project and to improve technical and vocational training centers. In particular, the Project \nwill  upgrade  facilities  and  equipment,  train  teachers,  provide  instructional  materials,  and  establish  career \nguidance and counseling centers. \n \nGender Plan \n \nSeveral project measures are being proposed to give girls, especially in rural areas, access to TEVT. \n \nTraining facilities and equipment at vocational training centers for girls will be upgraded. Initially, the centers \nnow  housed  in  rented  facilities  will  be  provided  with  their  own  facilities  and  equipment,  and  instructional \nmaterials upgraded. New programs will also give girls better career choices. \n \nThe Project will establish two new vocational centers, among other measures, to expand girls\u2019 opportunities \nto take up TEVT, especially in rural areas. The following is a summary of interventions: \n \n(i)  Two  new  vocational  training  centers  for  girls  will  be  established  at  Chitral  and  Karak.  Computer  and \ninformation  technology,  telecommunication  technology,  and  biotechnology  will  be  introduced  to  the  girls  to \nexpose them to emerging technologies and enhance their job prospects. \n \n(ii)  Girls  and  boys  undergoing  TEVT  will  gain  experience  through  on-the-job  training  and  train  to  use \nmicrocredit and become self-employed. A career guidance and job placement center in each training center \nwill help girls prepare for and look for jobs after graduation.  \n \n(iii) Nonformal  livelihood skill  improvement  programs  will  target  20,000  rural  trainees,  at  least  half  of  whom \nwill be girls or women. NGOs will identify training needs for new skills and upgrading of traditional skills. \n \n(iv) To enable poor students, especially females, from rural and remote areas, to attend TEVT, training will be \nconducted  in  the  communities.  If  this  is  not  possible,  students  will  be  housed  in  hostels  or  other \naccommodation in areas with facilities. \n\n \n\n(v) The project management unit (PMU) and partner NGOs will involve female representatives of union and \ndistrict  councils  in  situation  analysis  and  in  planning  and  implementation  of  TEVT  and  livelihood  programs. \nThe PMU will include women staff in its management.  \n \n(vi) A national consultant will be included in the consultant package. The gender and development consultant \nwill work with the project implementation unit and partner NGOs to develop a gender action plan. \n \n(vii) A project performance monitoring and evaluation system will be developed and institutionalized to assess \nproject  impacts  on  job  creation  and  graduates\u2019  incomes,  and  other  related  indicators  by  gender  and \nsocioeconomic group. \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fE.
