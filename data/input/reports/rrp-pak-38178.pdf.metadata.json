The Project has three components: (i) \ninstitutional  development;  (ii)  improvement  of  quality  and \nrelevance improvement; and (iii) access and equity enhancement. \nThe  Project\u2019s  main  focus  is  to  improve  the  capacity  of  TEVT \ninstitutions to meet labor market needs by emphasizing public-\nprivate  partnership,  on-the-job  training,  and  job  counseling  for \nTEVT  graduates;  and  performance-based  management  and \nmanagement development programs to deliver TEVT efficiently. \nTEVT  programs  will  be  improved  through  competency-based \ntraining (CBT), teacher training, provision of learning resources, \nand quality control. The Project will support the rural poor and \nwomen  through  new  programs  and  facilities,  rural  livelihood \ntraining, and entrepreneurship training and access to microcredit \nfor self-employment. \n   \nRationale  NWFP has low literacy (40.0%\u201460.0% for males and 21.0% for \nfemales)  and  high  poverty  (39.8%  compared  to  32.1%  for \nPakistan). NWFP is thus developing skilled workers and creating \njobs, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises that use \nindigenous natural resources. NWFP has high unemployment, yet \njob vacancies often are unfilled due to lack of trained personnel. \nAbroad, demand is growing for skilled workers, especially in the \nMiddle  East  and  Malaysia.  The  TEVT  system\u2019s  internal  and \nexternal  efficiency  urgently  needs  to  improve.  Through \nconsolidation  and  strengthening  of  TEVT  programs,  and \ninvestments  to  make  the  TEVT  system  more  responsive  and \ncompetitive, TEVT trainees\u2019 job or self-employment prospects will \nimprove.  \n   ", "  iii\nObjectives   The  Project  aims  to  help  the  Government  reduce  poverty  by \nenhancing  competitiveness  of  TEVT  and  the  employability  of \ngraduates  in  line  with  market  needs.  The  Project\u2019s  specific \nobjectives  are  to  (i)  restructure  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity,  efficiency,  and  autonomy  of  TEVT  institutions;  (ii) \nimprove  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs;  and  (iii) \nenhance access to quality TEVT, particularly among the rural poor \nand women. \n \nThe Project will help DOI\u2019s Directorate of Technical Education and \nManpower  Training  (DTE&MT)  restructure  and  strengthen  its \ninstitutional capacity to provide quality TEVT. The Project will help \nTEVT  institutions  improve  their  planning  and  management  by \ngiving  them  autonomy  to  provide  quality  and  relevant  TEVT. \nTraining teachers, providing learning resources, introducing CBT, \nand  improving  quality  control  will  strengthen  TEVT  programs. \nSupporting new facilities and new TEVT programs, and providing \nlivelihood  training  will  increase  access  of  the  rural  poor  and \nwomen to TEVT. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $15.7 million equivalent, of which \n$3.7 million (24%) is the foreign exchange cost and $12.0 million \nequivalent (76%) the local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent)\nForeign  Local     \nSource \nExchange  Currency  Total  Percent \nGovernment  0.0  4.7  4.7  30 \nADB  3.7  7.3  11.0  70 \n  Total  3.7  12.0  15.7   100  \n      ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $11 million equivalent from the Asian Development Fund \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided.

Each supply contract for equipment and materials \nestimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000 will be \nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Each \ncivil  works  contract  estimated  at  less  than  $1  million  will  be \nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. Each supply \ncontract  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis of  \ninternational  shopping.  Equipment  and  textbooks  estimated,  in \naggregate,  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  directly \nprocured.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  77  person-months  of  consulting  services  (15 \ninternational,  and  62  domestic)  will  be  used  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged individually or as a \nfirm. A higher education institution and/or management institute \nwill be selected and engaged for the management development \nprogram, performance-based management, and development of \ncompetency-based training system development. The quality- and \ncost-based selection method will be applied to select and engage \nconsulting firms.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The direct beneficiaries of the Project will include about 11,000 \nBeneficiaries  students in 38 technical and vocational training centers (TVTCs) \nand 25 commercial colleges during the project period. About half \nthe beneficiaries will be students enrolled after these institutions \nexpand their capacity. The beneficiaries also include 20,000 out-\nof-school  youths  and  adults,  who  will  undergo  short-term \nlivelihood  training;  1,500  employed  workers,  who  will  upgrade \ntheir skills; 50 staff members, who will improve their teaching, \neducation planning, curriculum design, and industrial skills; and \n300 academic staff members, who will upgrade their educational \nlevel in national training programs. Qualitative improvements in \nthe  curriculum,  teaching  and  learning  methods,  and  learning \nresources  will  benefit  a  large  number  of  students  enrolled  in \nTVTCs at project completion. About 25% of direct beneficiaries \nare estimated to be women, 75% from rural areas, and about 40% \nfrom poor families. \n   \n  The Project will expand and improve the quality of rural TEVT to \nprovide livelihood programs for out-of-school youths and adults \nwho want to acquire job skills and to start their own business. \nNongovernment  organizations  will  plan  and  implement  the \nlivelihood programs. Identification of training needs and trades for \nself-employment will meet local as well as outside market needs. \nTEVT graduates will be helped to access microcredit to start small \nbusinesses and generate income and jobs. All these measures \nwill reduce poverty, especially in rural areas. ", "  v\n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project faces four possible risks: financial, institutional, policy, \nand economic. First, the Government\u2019s effort to expand TEVT \nwithout consolidating and ensuring effective services at existing \ntraining institutes could erode the financial and technical base to \nsustain these institutions\u2019 operations. The Project will strengthen \nthe capacity and autonomy of TEVT institutions and seeks the \nGovernment\u2019s  assurances  for  adequate  recurrent  budgets  and \nautonomy  of  TEVT  institutions  to  manage  their  financial \nresources. \n \nSecond, TEVT institutions lack the autonomy and leadership to \nmeet  labor  market  needs.  While  most  TEVT  institutions  have \ninstitute management committees (IMCs) or center management \ncommittees (CMCs), few of these committees are active, due to \nweak governance structure, weak role of principals, and lack of \ntime  among  committee  members.  The  Project  includes  a \nmanagement  development  program  and  performance-based \nmanagement  system  (PBMS)  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nprincipals, teachers, and staff of TEVT institutions. \n \nThird, while the federal policy is to improve the TEVT quality, \nmanagement, and financing, the policy cannot be realized without \nlinking TEVT institutions\u2019 performance with improvement plans, \ntargets,  and  policy  stipulations.  The  Project  aims  to  increase \nTEVT institutions\u2019 efficiency and effectiveness through innovative \nmeasures such as a quality assurance and accreditation system, \nPBMS,  examinations,  and  reform;  and  seeks  Government \nassurances  to  align  key  provincial  TEVT  policies  with  federal \npolicies. \n \n  Fourth, the economy is not growing fast enough to absorb more \ngraduates  from  TEVT  institutions.  To  remedy  this,  the  Project \nsupports much greater involvement of the private sector through \nIMCs, CMCs, production units, guidance counseling, and more \norganized labor market information. \n \n ", "  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Restructuring of Technical Education and Vocational \nTraining System Project (North-West Frontier Province). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  In the 1980s Pakistan enjoyed strong economic growth averaging 6.5%. However, it \nslowed  down  to  4.6%  in  the  1990s.  Key  social  indicators,  particularly  for  education,  also \nstagnated, unlike in other countries at similar levels of development. The economy, however, \nstarted recovering from FY2003, when growth rate was 5.1%. Growth further strengthened in \nFY2004,  with  the  growth  rate  estimated  at  6.4%.  To  achieve  the  targets  of  the  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), annual economic growth rate should be sustained at above \n6%, particularly since the population growth rate has remained high.  \n \n3.  The provincial government of the North-West Frontier Province (PGNWFP) faces dual \nproblems of high illiteracy and high incidence of poverty. The average literacy rate of the \npopulation 10 years and above is 38.0% (57.0% for males and 20.0% for females), and the net \nprimary school enrollment rate in 2001 was about 51% (61% for males and 41% for females). \nThe difference in literacy rates is marked between genders, and between urban (58%) and rural \n(37%) areas, although most people (75%) live in rural areas. Gross enrollment for boys was \nhigh at 110%, compared to only 63% for girls. About 58% of the students entering grade 1 reach \ngrade 10 after repeating several grades, indicating that many children leave school without skills \nand knowledge.  \n \n4.  The poverty headcount for the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is about 39.8%, \ncompared to 32.1% for Pakistan. Urban and rural poverty are higher in NWFP than the entire \ncountry, leading to large variations in educational attainment among different economic groups. \nFor  instance,  net  enrollment  in  primary  education  was  only  37%  for  the  lowest  economic \nquintile, compared to 59% for the highest. Poverty increased rapidly during the 1990s because \neconomic growth slowed down and per capita income increased only negligibly. Poverty also \nincreased because of (i) limited job growth and absorption capacity in the formal sector; (ii) high \nlabor costs in the formal sector that lead to overexpansion of a low-productivity informal sector, \nthus lowering informal sector wages; (iii) limited opportunities for unskilled youth to obtain on-\nthe-job training and skills; and (iv) low quality of social services, particularly in education and \nhealth. \n \n5.  Pakistan\u2019s labor force grows at over 2% per annum, while employment grows much \nmore slowly. The official unemployment rate is 5.4\u20135.9%, while the underemployment rate, \nthose working less than 35 hours a week, is about 12.0%. The situation is much worse in \nNWFP, with a 13% (17% for females) unemployment rate and a 41% labor force participation \nrate (17% for females). Most workers are self-employed or unpaid family workers, while wage \nearners account for less than one third of the labor force. Of urban unemployed youths 10\u201324 \nyears old, most are either illiterate or with qualifications below grade-10 pass. The Government \nis thus developing skilled workers and creating jobs, especially in small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) that use indigenous natural resources. Abroad, demand is growing for \nskilled workers, especially in the Middle East and Malaysia. The Project will reduce poverty by \nproviding  access  to  quality  technical  education  and  vocational  training  (TEVT)  programs, ", "2  \nespecially  in  rural  areas  and  for  women,  and  help  TEVT  graduates  access  credit  for \nemployment or self-employment in SMEs. \n \n6.  The  TEVT  subsector  comprises  12  polytechnics  (1  for  women),  with  about  5,500 \nstudents (205 women) and about 450 teachers, and 38 technical and vocational training centers \n(TVTCs, 11 for women), with about 3,200 students and about 390 teachers. Local jobs are \nlimited although NWFP has been able to take advantage of the market abroad. Given the low \nparticipation rate in general education, low completion rates at the primary and secondary \nlevels, and a large TEVT subsector dominated by the public sector, PGNWFP will have to adopt \na two-pronged strategy: (i) improve general school education as a priority, with focus on girls \nand rural children; and (ii) provide selective support to training programs given that many youths \nlack the skills to seek jobs. As general education improves, support for TEVT will shift to \npractical aspects of training, since core life skills are expected to come from general education. \nHowever, until then, TEVT will have to focus on formal and nonformal programs to complement, \nand not substitute for, general education. This approach benefits the poor, who need a second \nchance at developing life skills. TEVT must be viewed holistically to fill in gaps in the context of \noverall educational needs. \n \n7.  The strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for development assistance to \nPakistan, as articulated in the Country Strategy and Program 2002\u20132006,1 focuses on poverty \nreduction  through  sustainable  pro-poor  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  and  good \ngovernance. ADB\u2019s strategy also highlights the need for comprehensive human development \nstrategies, devolution of services for human development, and education reforms for quality. In \nparticular, ADB supports the Government\u2019s Education Sector Reforms Action Plan, linked with \ndevolution to promote public-private partnerships. ADB also emphasizes the need to move \naway from Government and umbrella projects to focused, provincial ones. ADB\u2019s strategy is in \nline with the Government\u2019s National Education Policy, Education Sector Reforms Action Plan, \nand PRSP\u2014all of which stress the role of technical education in producing skilled workers and \ntechnicians. The Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan of 2001\u20132011 points out that options \nare still limited for technical, commercial, and vocational education, and sets as a priority the \nintroduction of technical education at the secondary and postsecondary levels. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  Despite progress made, TEVT still faces several challenges and constraints. Appendix 1 \nprovides the project framework, Appendix 2 the problem tree, and Appendix 3 a brief sector \nanalysis. Some key issues and opportunities are discussed in the following sections.  \n \n9.  Weak Institutional Capacity. The Directorate of Technical Education and Manpower \nTraining  (DTE&MT)  is  responsible  for  planning,  coordination,  and  supervision,  as  well  as \nresearch and development (R&D) for technical education at all levels. Since DTE&MT was \ncreated only in January 2002 by combining the former Directorate of Technical Education under \nthe Department of Education with the Directorate of Manpower Training under the Department \nof Industries (DOI), it is still realigning its mission and strengthening TEVT operations in the \nprovince. DTE&MT\u2019s institutional capacity needs to be strengthened, particularly to improve the \nquality  of  TEVT  programs,  R&D  policy  reform,  quality  assurance,  and  linkage  between \nindustries and TEVT institutions. Capacity building for DTE&MT is crucial to enable its staff to \ncarry out its new mandate and combined functions. Research capacity needs to be improved to \nmeet labor market needs and to develop skills and attitudes necessary to get jobs or self-\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006). Manila. ", "  3\nemployment. Organizational support is necessary to enable DOI to evolve an institution similar \nto the TEVT authority in Punjab. \n \n10.  Low  Internal  and  External  Efficiency.  Internal  efficiency  of  polytechnic  programs \nremains a concern, although it has improved over the years. The high dropout rate wastes \nresources and must be lowered. Less than 50% of students pass external examinations.  \n \n11.  External efficiency, as measured by the number of graduates who get jobs, also needs \nto be improved. The labor market survey conducted under an advisory technical assistance2 \nshowed that graduates of diploma of associate engineer (DAE) programs had spent 1\u20132 years \nlooking for a job before they found one. These graduates required additional training of 3\u20136 \nmonths after recruitment. Finding work takes such a long time partly because the private sector \nhas few jobs, and partly because the required training and skills are mismatched (para. 12) with \nthe quality and relevance of technical education (para. 14). Entrepreneurship training could be \nintroduced to prepare students for self-employment. Job placement services should be provided \nfor graduating students. Polytechnics and TVTCs can also offer short-term modular training \nprograms for people who want to acquire skills and start their own business. Given that the \nGovernment encourages semiskilled and skilled workers to find work abroad, especially in the \nMiddle East, Malaysia, and other countries, TEVT must play an important role. \n \n12.  Weak Linkage with Labor Market Needs. Although demand for some traditional trades \nand technologies (electrical, electronics, and mechanical) and for new trades and technologies \n(computer, information, and telecommunications) is expected to remain high, as skills and \ndemand are mismatched. A labor market survey confirmed that (i) not enough graduates are \nbeing  produced  in  some  of  the  traditional  courses,  and  training  opportunities  in  new \ntechnologies are limited; and (ii) even if the courses are available, labor market information is \nlacking, practical training components limited and inappropriate, and linkages with industries \nlacking.  \n \n13.  The lack of sharing of information and resources between industry and TEVT institutions \ncreates a gap between users and producers of skilled workers, lowering the quality of TEVT \nprograms and graduates. Students fail to acquire employable skills. To forge a closer link \nbetween industries and TEVT institutions, institute management committees (IMCs) have been \nestablished at polytechnics, and center management committees (CMCs) at TVTCs. However, \nthe  committees  have  not  proved  effective  in  drawing  assistance  and  cooperation  from \nindustries. The committees must be strengthened, leadership enhanced, and the resource base \nimproved. The committees, which include large representation of industries, need to focus on \nproviding  on-the-job  training  for  students,  industrial  training  for  TEVT  teachers,  and  job \nplacement services for TEVT graduates. \n \n14.  Poor Quality of Examinations. The Provincial Board of Technical Education (PBTE) \ngives examinations to students in polytechnic institutes, government colleges of technology, and \ncommercial colleges; and the Trade Testing Board (TTB) to students in the 38 TVTCs. The two \nboards do not coordinate much. The examinations, given annually, are rigid in scope, content, \ncoverage, types of questions, theory-to-practice ratio, and marking procedures. The passing \nrate ranges from 18% for the diploma in business administration to 49% for the DAE. In 2002, \nTVTC passing rates ranged from 74% for machinists to 100% for plumbers and welders. The \nlowest passing rate that year was 39% for draftsman. The examination process should be \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Restructuring of Technical Education and Vocational Education \nSystem. Manila. \n ", "4  \ndecentralized  and  responsibilities  delegated  to  the  training  institutions.  A  system  of \nexaminations  given  at  the  end  of  each  semester  is  being  explored.  Examination  system \nimprovements are expected to enable TEVT institutions to raise the performance of students \nand prepare them for employment, thereby reducing wastage. \n \n15.  Limited Access to and Options for Technical Education and Vocational Training. \nAlthough a reasonable network of training facilities is available in various parts of the province, \naccess to quality TEVT programs remains limited, especially for the rural population. Small \ntraining centers generally have poor facilities and training programs, and many are far from \ncommunity centers. Traveling to and from rural training centers is difficult, especially for girls. \nPGNWFP  needs  assistance  to  upgrade  the  facilities  and  improve  access  to  quality  TEVT \nprograms in rural areas. \n \n16.  Role of the Public Sector. The TEVT system is highly supply driven and needs to \ndevelop mechanisms to respond to market needs. TEVT programs can be improved, and the \nrole of PGNWFP limited to policy, planning, and monitoring and evaluation, as envisaged by the \nGovernment,  with  implementation  responsibilities  gradually  devolved  to  TEVT  institutions \nsupported by district management committees (DMCs). \n   \n17.  Lessons  Learned.  Appendix  4  lists  lessons  learned  and  how  they  have  been \nincorporated into the project design. The Technical Education Project (TEP) and an impact \nstudy, both supported by ADB, show that TEVT institutions should be expanded cautiously, and \nconsolidated and strengthened.3 TEVT institutions should have resources for operations and \nmaintenance and fill up all teaching vacancies. High turnover of project directors has also \nharmed project implementation. Due to lack of information on labor market needs and absence \nof R&D, TEVT institutions have been irrelevant and unresponsive to emerging needs.  \n \n18.  Punjab\u2019s experience in institutional consolidation (406 institutions in seven departments \nplaced under one umbrella department) and efforts to move away from Government provision of \nTEVT  to  standard  setting,  facilitation,  regulation,  and  coordination;  Sindh\u2019s  experience  in \ndevolution to the districts; and NWFP\u2019s efforts to consolidate institutions show the implications \nfor TEVT institutions. While it is committed to consolidate TEVT programs, PGNWFP should \nalso  institutionalize  strategic  planning,  policy  reform,  quality  assurance,  and  curriculum \ndevelopment, and support gradual autonomy and strong leadership at polytechnics and training \ncenters. \n \n19.  External Assistance. While in the past German Agency for Technical Cooperation \n(GTZ) supported technical and vocational training in the province, external support for TEVT is \ngenerally  limited.  External  assistance  to  the  education  sector  in  Pakistan  is  described  in \nAppendix 5. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective  \n \n20.  The goal of the Project is to contribute to the Government\u2019s overall strategic aim of \npoverty  reduction  by  improving  the  competitiveness  of  TEVT  system  and  enhancing  the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1995.

", "  5\nemployment prospects of TEVT graduates in line with emerging market needs. The Project\u2019s \nspecific objectives are to (i) restructure and strengthen institutional capacity, efficiency, and \nautonomy of TEVT institutions; (ii) improve the quality and relevance of TEVT programs; and (iii) \nincrease access to better-quality TEVT programs, particularly among rural poor and women.   \n   \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n21.  The Project has three components: (i) development of institutions, (ii) improvement of \nTEVT quality and relevance, and (iii) enhancement of access and equity. \n  \n  1.  Institutional Development  \n \n22.  This component will help TEVT institutions restructure themselves and to strengthen \ntheir institutional capacity, efficiency, and operational autonomy to plan, manage, and develop \nprograms. The Project\u2019s policy implications are presented under assurances (para. 82) and in \nAppendix 6. This component has three subcomponents: (i) restructuring and strengthening \ncapacity of DTE&MT, (ii) strengthening capacity and efficiency of TEVT institutions, and (iii) \nimplementing performance-based management system (PBMS) in TEVT institutions. \n \na.  Restructuring,  and  Strengthening  Capacity  of,  the  Directorate  of \nTechnical Education and Manpower Training \n \n23.  DTE&MT is responsible for ensuring effective planning, management, monitoring, and \nsupervision of TEVT institutions. DTE&MT\u2019s capacity and resources need to be strengthened, \nespecially in R&D, program evaluation, institutional monitoring and supervision, and public-\nprivate  partnership.  The  Project  will  (i)  strengthen  the  R&D  cell  and  incorporate  it  under \nDTE&MT, (ii) implement and institutionalize quality assurance and accreditation system, (iii) and \ninstitutionalize DMC for TEVT. \n \n24.  Strengthening the Research and Development Cell. The R&D cell was established \nunder the TEP4 and attached to its project implementation unit . The cell\u2019s mandate is to make \nTEVT graduates employable. The Project will strengthen the R&D cell by providing training for \ncore staff; supplying office equipment and funds for labor market surveys; and developing a full-\nfledged computerized management information system (MIS), labor market information system \n(LMIS), and performance monitoring and evaluation system (PPMIS). The R&D cell will be \nincorporated under DTE&MT during project implementation. Through a competitive process the \nR&D cell will identify research and academic institutions to conduct research. \n \n25.  Institutionalizing  Quality  Assurance  and  Accreditation  System.  To  strengthen \nDTE&MT\u2019s registration system and improve the quality of TEVT programs in public and private \nTEVT  institutions,  the  Project  will  help  DTE&MT  (i)  establish  a  quality  assurance  and \naccreditation  system;  (ii)  strengthen  and  institutionalize  the  registration,  monitoring,  and \nassessment of TEVT institutions throughout the province; (iii) develop accreditation standards; a \nquality  assurance  system;  and  mechanisms,  including  criteria,  guidelines,  manuals,  and \ninstruments, to assess and improve the quality of TEVT programs; and (iv) provide equipment, \ntraining, and seed money to implement the system in public and private TEVT institutions. The \nProject will support training for staff of polytechnics and TVTCs to establish an internal quality \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n ", "6  \nassurance  unit.  The  Project  will  also  fund  DTE&MT  to  strengthen  quality  assurance  and \naccreditation, testing and certification, policymaking, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n26.  Establishing a District Management Committee. The Project will help establish and \ninstitutionalize a DMC for each project district. The Project will provide modest funds to support \nthe  DMC\u2019s  activities  at  the  beginning.  The  DMC,  comprising  representatives  of  industries, \neducation institutions, and the community will promote collaboration between local industries, \nthe community, and institutions to mobilize resources and support from the private sector for \nTEVT institutions. The DMC will coordinate with IMCs and CMCs to help link the polytechnics \nand training centers with industries at the district level.  \n \nb.  Strengthening  Capacity  of  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining Institutions \n \n27.  TEVT institutions have limited capacity and autonomy to plan, develop, and manage \ntheir  programs  and  operations,  especially  course  offerings  and  curriculum  development, \nrecruitment  and  hiring  of  teachers,  staff  development  programs,  financial  control  and \naccountability, and examinations. The Project will support an institution-based management \nsystem to enhance the capacity, autonomy, effectiveness, and efficiency of TEVT institutions to \nplan and manage their own affairs. In particular, the Project will (i) strengthen the capacity and \nresources of IMCs and CMCs, (ii) implement management development programs (MDPs) for \nprincipals and key staff members, and (iii) implement a PBMS in TEVT institutions. \n \n28.  Strengthening Committee Capacity and Resources. The Project will support IMC and \nCMC operations in all TEVT institutions. The composition, structure, roles, responsibilities, and \nmechanisms to make the committees more effective will be reviewed and strengthened. Modest \nseed  money  will  be  provided  based  on  the  committees\u2019  proposals.  Committee  members\u2019 \ncapacity  will  be  strengthened.  A  consultant  will  help  prepare  procedural  manuals  and \nhandbooks for reference of the committees and TEVT institutions.  \n \n29.  Implementing  the  Management  Development  Program.  Qualified  management \ninstitutions, including universities and higher-education institutions, will be invited to propose \nways to implement the MDP. It will strengthen the capability of principals, teachers, and key \nTEVT officials to assume more responsibilities and autonomy in planning, management, and \neffective resource mobilization and use. The MDP will include market and competitiveness \nanalysis  for  demand-based  training,  financial  planning  and  management,  performance \nimprovement, institutional development, proposal preparation and project implementation, and \ntraining program evaluation. The Project will provide support to TEVT institutions based on their \ninstitutional development plans.  \n  \n30.  Implementing Performance-Based Management System. To promote accountable \nand efficient TEVT management, the Project will implement PBMS in all project institutions. \nTEVT institutions will be required to prepare a 5-year institutional development plan as a basis \nfor  budgetary  allocations.  Indicators  such  as  enrollments,  number  of  poor  students  in  the \nprograms, dropout and pass rates, and employment of graduates, to be developed as part of \nthe Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System (PPMES), will be used to assess \nproject  institutions\u2019  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  The  Project  will  provide  funds  to  develop \nguidelines, criteria, and operation manuals to implement the system. The Project will also \nprovide a block fund as an incentive to project institutions producing the best results. Such \ninstitutions may subsequently develop into centers of excellence. Gradually, TEVT institutions \nwill develop the capacity to manage their own operations autonomously. PGNWFP will issue ", "  7\ndirectives to institutionalize the PBMS, which will be tied to budgetary allocations after project \ncompletion.  The  services  of  a  management  institution  or  firm  as  part  of  the  MDP,  and  a \nconsultant will be provided to develop and implement the PBMS. \n \n  2.  Improvement  in  Quality  and  Relevance  of  Technical  Education  and \nVocational Training \n \n31.  This component will help improve the quality and relevance of TEVT programs in 12 \nexisting polytechnics and 40 TVTCs (38 existing and 2 new) by (i) introducing competency-\nbased  training  (CBT)  system  development  and  examination  reform,  (ii)  supporting  facility \nupgrading and learning resource development, and (iii) improving relevance of TEVT programs \nthrough innovative schemes.  \n \na.  Competency-Based Training System Development and Examination \nReform  \n \n32.  Competency-Based Training System Development. The Project will help develop a \nframework and mechanisms for introducing the CBT system in TEVT institutions to support the \nacquisition of skills, knowledge, and work attitudes required by industries. Teachers will be \ntrained to prepare lessons, instructional materials, and learning modules in the CBT format, to \nhelp students practice and acquire the needed skills. Each project institution will nominate \ncourses in technologies and trades to be converted into the CBT format for project funding. \nEach technology and trade will convert at least one course into the CBT format. Project funds \nwill be made available through the project institutions for teachers who submit proposals to \ndevelop lessons and instructional materials and learning modules and packages in the CBT \nformat. An institution will be selected to train teachers, coordinate development, implementation, \nand monitor the CBT system. Social marketing programs will be funded to raise awareness of \nprincipals, teachers, students, and the public of the CBT system. The Project will help introduce \nthe CBT system gradually in TEVT institutions through incentives and active participation of \nteachers and institutions. \n \n33.  Examination  Reform.  PBTE  conducts  annual  examinations  for  DAE  students  at \npolytechnics  and  commercial  colleges,  and  TTB  does  the  same  at  TVTCs.  Examination \npractices  are  inflexible  and  do  not  encourage  students  to  acquire  the  skills  required  by \nindustries. The Project will develop an operational framework and manual to increase TEVT \ninstitutions\u2019 autonomy and responsibility to conduct CBT-format skill tests. Teachers will train to \nprepare reliable and valid skill tests and practical examinations. The Project will also help PBTE \nand TTB, based on their proposals, improve the quality of examinations, training of examiners \nand paper setters, examination item bank, and examination management system; and provide \noffice equipment and materials to computerize the TTB examination system. \n \nb.  Quality Improvement through Facilities Upgrading and  \nLearning Resource Development \n \n34.  Construction of New Facilities for Five Technical and Vocational Training Centers \nfor Girls. Of the 38 TVTCs, 11 are for girls; of these, 8 are in old rented facilities, mostly far \nfrom community centers. The Project will help construct new facilities for five TVTCs in major \ntown centers and will provide equipment, instructional materials, staff training, and furniture. \nThese TVTCs will serve the rural population. \n \n ", "8  \n35.  Upgrading of Equipment in 26 Technical and Vocational Training Centers. The \nProject will provide new and additional training equipment and furniture in the remaining 6 \nTVTCs for girls and in 20 for boys. Three TVTCs for girls and three for boys will be designated \nas \u201cmodel training centers\u201d in locations with potential for development. The centers will offer \nhigh-quality training not only in modern trades but also in traditional arts and crafts using natural \nresources such as marble, wood, and other materials. Programs that increase the value of \nagricultural products, such as food preservation and food technology, will be introduced. The \ncenters will also help promote cultural heritage, increase the value of natural resources, and \ngenerate income for communities. \n \n36.  Upgrading  of  Three  Polytechnics  to  Centers  of  Excellence.  To meet  industries\u2019 \nneeds  and  prepare  highly  qualified  technicians  for  industries,  three  polytechnics  will  be \nupgraded to centers of excellence in specialized areas. The schools will be provided with \nequipment, laboratories, and workshops for one new program in either telecommunications or \nmechatronics (computerized system of production) as well as additional equipment to upgrade \none program that is in demand by industries. These centers of excellence will be required to \nprepare an institutional development plan on use of the new technology and upgrading of the \nprogram, costs involved, staff development, recruitment and hiring of additional staff, curriculum \ndevelopment, and equipment lists, among others, for approval by DTE&MT before project funds \ncan be released to the institutions. \n \n37.  Introduction of Mining Technology Program. Mineral resources abound in NWFP. To \nsupport PGNWFP\u2019s plan to expand the mining industry, an instructional program in mining \ntechnology will be offered at one polytechnic near mining sources. The Project will provide \nmodest civil works, laboratories, workshops, equipment, teaching staff, and staff training. \n \n38.  Upgrading of Computer Laboratories in 22 Commercial Colleges and 2 Training \nCenters.  Commercial  colleges  and  training  centers,  which  offer  a  diploma  and  bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in commerce, are popular among graduates aspiring for service sector jobs. Since most \ncolleges  have  too  many  students,  many  offer  evening  shifts.  All  the  students  must  take \ncomputer courses. However, as computer facilities are inadequate, training quality is poor. The \nProject will improve the quality of computer training at 22 commercial colleges and 2 training \ncenters by providing computers, software, and other training equipment.  \n \n39.  Development of Learning Resource Centers. To support the CBT system and to allow \nteachers and students to pursue self-learning, a learning resource center-cum-library will be \nestablished  at  all  polytechnics  and  TVTCs.  The  Project  will  provide  computers,  software, \nmultimedia packages, books, and journals. Where library space is inadequate, the Project will \nprovide modest support for extra space with furniture.  \n    \nc.  Improving  Relevance  of  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTrainings through Innovative Schemes \n   \n40.  This  subcomponent  will  introduce  innovative  schemes  to  make  TEVT  graduates \nemployable.  The  Project  will  introduce  an  entrepreneurship  training  program  in  TEVTs  in \npartnership with the private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). A consultant will \nhelp develop curriculum, textbooks, manuals, and instructional materials in CBT format for all \nTEVT  institutions.  The  entrepreneurship  training  modules  will  be  mandatory  for  all  TEVT \nstudents. Teachers will train to conduct the program using the materials prepared under the \nProject. To help TEVT graduates start their own business, the Project will involve the same ", "  9\nconsultant along with experienced private sector institute and/or NGOs to facilitate access to \ncredit by graduates. \n \n41.  The Project will support on-the-job training to enable students to acquire relevant skills, \nknowledge, work discipline, and industrial and work experience. The scheme will also foster \ncooperation between TEVT institutions and the private sector. The IMCs and CMCs will help \nestablish linkages and operational mechanisms with local industries to support this scheme. The \nProject will engage an entrepreneurship and microcredit specialist to help develop operational \nguidelines, mechanisms, and procedures to ensure effective implementation of the scheme.  \n \n42.  The Project will support the recently reestablished employment exchange program at \nDTE&MT with a network of nine employment exchange centers based at the training centers. \nThe Project will provide equipment, support for staff at DTE&MT and employment exchange \noffices, and staff development programs. The Project will provide furniture, equipment, and \ncareer  guidance  materials  at  career  guidance  and  job  placement  centers  at  all  TEVT \ninstitutions. A staff member will be trained as a career guidance and job placement officer, \neither full or part time. With the support of the CMC/IMC, the center will liaise regularly with \nindustries to obtain information about job openings and provide career guidance and counseling \nservices  to  TEVT  students.  The  center  will  maintain  a  database  on  local  industries,  job \nopenings, job placements, and employment records of TEVT graduates, and maintain and \nupdate it regularly. A career guidance and job placement specialist will help do this. \n \n43.  The Project will help establish a production-cum-service center in partnership with the \nprivate sector in selected TEVT institutions. The center will accept work orders for production \nand provide services to internal and external clients. The management of the unit will be \ncontracted out to qualified private institutions or NGOs that are willing to engage teachers from \nTEVT institutions and train the students on a profit-sharing basis. The students will be given \nallowances for their work at the center. TEVT institutions will be allowed to retain a share of the \nincome. The Project will provide facilities, equipment, furniture, staff development, and seed \nmoney for the center and support its initial operations. It is expected to become self-sufficient \nand will be managed independently as a business unit. \n \n3.  Access and Equity Enhancement \n \n44.  This component will increase access to TEVT by the rural poor and women, especially \nthose who cannot obtain skill training in TEVT programs. This component covers three key \nareas: (i) introduction of equivalency and certification system, (ii) implementation of nonformal \nlivelihood skills improvement programs at TVTCs, and (iii) establishment of two VTCs for girls in \nChittral and Karak. \n \na.  Introduction of Equivalency and Certification System \n \n45.  To  help  workers  who  want  to  obtain  technical  qualifications  through  external \nexaminations, the Project will establish an equivalency and certification system for a nonformal \nsystem with mechanisms for skill assessment based on CBT standards. The system will give \nqualifying credits and issue trade certificates to students, trainees, and workers who pass the \nexternal examinations and assessments. The equivalency system will allow those who have \nstudied before to continue their studies, and skilled workers to obtain formal qualifications \nabroad. DTE&MT will be responsible for developing, implementing, and institutionalizing the \nequivalency and certification system for all TVTCs. Selected training centers will be designated \nas  skill  assessment  centers.  The  Project  will  provide  them  with  consultancy  services, \n ", "10  \ninfrastructure, equipment, and materials. Social marketing activities will increase awareness and \nacceptance of the equivalency and certification system among the students and the public.  \n \nb.  Implementation of Nonformal Livelihood Skill  \nImprovement Programs \n \n46.  Nonformal training programs of DTE&MT to improve livelihoods and provide employable \nskills to about 20,000 out-of-school youths and adults (at least 50% women) will be provided \nlargely through competitively selected NGOs. Polytechnics and TVTCs can also compete for the \nfunds  and  may  choose  to  partner  with  NGOs.  Subjects  and  topics  will  be  based  on  the \ncommunities\u2019 needs and on jobs in the areas. Course duration will be flexible but normally \nshorter than the standard training programs. Course fees will be minimal to ensure some cost \nrecovery and enable the poor to acquire skills. To be eligible for funds, TEVT institutions and \nNGOs will conduct a situation analysis with stakeholders and potential trainees to plan livelihood \ntraining programs on farm and nonfarm activities for the poor. After the analysis, the TEVT \ninstitutions and NGOs will submit a proposal to conduct nonformal livelihood training programs \nto the project management unit for approval and funding. Livelihood training programs will be \nintroduced to remote communities and the rural poor. Funding will be based on the duration of \nthe course, number of trainees, and other criteria. TEVT institutions offering nonformal training \nprograms  will  be  allowed  to  retain  and  use  the  money  from  the  Project,  and  the  fees  to \nsupplement their regular budgets. The programs could eventually be made a regular feature of \nTEVT institutions as outreach and community services and to promote jobs for the poor. \n \nc.  Establishment of Two Technical and Vocational \nTraining Centers for Girls  \n \n47.  The Project will support the construction of two TVTCs for girls in Chittral and Karak, \nwhich do not have training facilities. The tourism and food industries, especially, in these remote \ndistricts could hire many skilled workers. The centers will be provided with basic infrastructure, \nequipment, furniture, a learning resource center, and instructional materials similar to those to \nbe provided to other TVTCs.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n48.  The Project will help NWFP strengthen TEVT institutions and to meet the needs of the \nmarket and of women and rural poor. Existing investments will be maximized by filling all \nteacher vacancies, providing in-service training to teachers, improving quality and relevance of \nprograms,  and  allocating  adequate  budget  for  basic  operations  and  maintenance  and \nfunctioning of TEVT institutions before embarking on any large-scale expansion.  \n \n49.  The Project will improve TEVT institutions\u2019 efficiency by giving them autonomy and \nimproving their management and instructional leadership, promoting partnership with the private \nsector  to  run  evening  classes  and  production  units,  and  supporting  performance-based \nmanagement. This approach is necessary to move away from a supply- to a demand-driven \nTEVT system. \n \n50.  The Project will support TEVT programs for females and the poor in rural areas. It will \nalso explore the possibility of introducing double shifts in selected TEVT institutions to run \nprograms for males and females. The Project will support selected hostel facilities for rural \nwomen; livelihood programs (fisheries, livestock, agriculture, food preservation, crafts, etc., and ", "  11\naccess to microcredit) for rural poor and women; and engagement of NGOs to provide services \nto them. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n51.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $15.7  million  equivalent,  of  which  an \nestimated $3.7 million or 24% is the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost is estimated \nat $12 million, equivalent to 76% of the total cost. Cost estimates by component are shown in \nTable 1, with details in Appendix 7.  \n \n \nTable 1.

A steering committee, headed by the \nadditional chief secretary of the Planning and Development Department, has been established, \nand  include  representatives  from  DOI,  DOF,  Chamber  of  Commerce,  DTE&MT,  and  local \ngovernment. The steering committee will meet at least once every quarter to review project \nimplementation. It will be responsible for coordinating policy reforms, addressing bottlenecks, \nand providing overall guidance. \n \n54.  The  DTE&MT  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  as  it  was  for  the  TEP.  A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be set up at or near DTE&MT, with a project director appointed \ncompetitively  and  supported  by  a  deputy  project  director,  accounts/disbursement  officer, \nprocurement officer, monitoring and evaluation officer, and other staff as appropriate whose \nqualifications, experience and expertise are acceptable to ADB. The project director will be \nresponsible for the overall implementation of the Project in close collaboration with the recipient \nTEVT institutions. The PMU will organize quarterly implementation review meetings and submit \na quarterly progress report to the steering committee and ADB. Implementation arrangements \nare described in Appendix 8. \n \n55.  Each district affected by the Project will establish a DMC and will assign a district project \ncoordinator to supervise and implement district-level activities. Each coordinator will seek inputs \nfrom either consultants or experts from PGNWFP. The PMU will provide technical support to \ncoordinators.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n56.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  starting  in  April  2005,  and  will  be \ncompleted by 31 October 2010. A tentative implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n57.  Procurement of ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil works will be carried out \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  supply  contract  for  equipment  and \nmaterials estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis \nof international competitive bidding. Each civil works contract estimated at less than $1 million \nwill be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. Each supply contract for equipment or \nmaterials estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis of  \ninternational shopping. Equipment and textbooks estimated, in aggregate, at less than $100,000 \nequivalent may be directly procured.  The indicative contract packages are in Appendix 10. ", "  13\n4.  Consulting Services \n \n58.  A total of 77 person-months of consulting services (15 international and 62 domestic) will \nbe  used  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  individually  or  as  a  firm.  A  higher  education  institution  and/or \nmanagement institute will be selected and engaged for the management development program, \nperformance-based  management,  and  development  of  competency-based  training  system \ndevelopment.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  applied  to  select  and \nengage consulting firms. Appendix 11 provides indicative terms of reference and consultancy \nrequirements. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n59.  DOI will, immediately after the loan effectiveness, establish an imprest account at a \nbranch of the National Bank of Pakistan, Peshawar for the PMU to expedite disbursement of the \nloan  proceeds,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed \narrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the \nimprest account will not exceed $300,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be \nfollowed to liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual payments of $50,000 and \nbelow. \n \n60.  To expedite preparatory activities, DOI must take advance action, particularly to select \nand engage a higher education institution and/or a management institute, select and recruit \nconsultants, and prepare bid documents. Retroactive financing of up to $200,000 has been \napproved  in  principle  for  preparatory  activities  between  loan  negotiations  and  loan \neffectiveness. All advance action will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  PGNWFP  was  advised  that  the  approval  of \nadvance action and retroactive financing (in principle) does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n61.  The PMU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation in line with ADB\u2019s \nproject performance report, and submit them to ADB within 30 days of the end of each quarter.  \nWithin 3 months of physical completion, the PMU will submit a project completion report to ADB. \nDTE&MT will (i) maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures financed out of the \nproceeds of the loan; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish to \nADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s report. The report will include an audit with \nseparate opinion on the use of imprest account with the statement of expenditure procedure. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System  \n \n62.  The Project focuses on strengthening MIS, LMIS, and PPMES, as well as undertaking \nresearch on areas such as tracer studies of graduates and labor market surveys. During the first \nyear, the Project will help DTE&MT establish a comprehensive project performance monitoring \nand  evaluation  system  by  developing  baseline  information  on  all  TEVT  institutions,  and \ndeveloping MIS and LMIS linked to a set of key monitoring indicators indicated in the project \nframework. The PPMES will help monitor progress made on key indicators, and also help all \n ", "14  \nTEVT  institutions  monitor  their  performance  against  the  indicators  in  their  institutional \ndevelopment plan. The indicators will cover internal and external efficiency as well as quality \nand  institutional  indicators  such  as  number  of  teacher  positions  filled,  quality  of  teachers, \navailability  of  instructional  materials,  institutional  capacity,  etc.  The  PPMES  will  allow \ncomparison between the status at the time of project start-up and outputs at midterm and end of \nthe Project. TEVT annual planning and budgeting will be linked to information available from the \nPPMES. The PPMES will establish mechanisms to introduce mandatory reporting and sharing \nof information with the public. To ensure effective and transparent utilization of resources, \nPGNWFP will require the TEVT institutions to provide financial information to DMCs each year. \nAppendix 12 provides a list of key indicators and strategy for the PPMES. \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n63.  PGNWFP and ADB will jointly conduct two semiannual reviews (at least one full review). \nPGNWFP and ADB will jointly establish the issues to be addressed during each mission, and \nreports required. PGNWFP and ADB will carry out a midterm review of project implementation \narrangements, focusing on a few key issues, during the third year of implementation. ADB and \nPGNWFP will consider changes based on the findings of the review. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n64.  The Project focuses on consolidating and strengthening existing TEVT programs, and \nimproving  TEVT  institutions\u2019  capacity  to  become  more  competitive,  provide  high-quality  and \nrelevant skills to TEVT students in selected technologies, and give women and the rural poor \naccess to training. The Project will make TEVT more responsive to labor market needs and help \ngraduates find jobs quickly at home or abroad or acquire microcredit to start own ventures. The \nProject\u2019s staff development activities will improve TEVT teachers\u2019 practical and subject skills. \nEnterprises and other employers will benefit from the availability of trained and skilled workers, \nwhich will improve production quality, increase productivity, and make management more efficient. \nAll these inputs will improve the TEVT system\u2019s external efficiency by creating jobs and increasing \nearnings. The Project will benefit the economy, particularly NWFP, by contributing to long-term \nsustainable industrial, commercial, and agricultural growth.  \n \n65.  In over 6 years the Project will directly benefit about 11,000 students (about 3,000 \ngraduates) in 12 polytechnics, about 20,000 students in 38 training centers (about the same \nnumber of graduates), and about 20,000 out-of-school adults and women who will receive \nnonformal  livelihood  training.  Other  direct  beneficiaries  include  about  450  teachers  in \npolytechnics, about 390 in training centers, and about 550 IMC and CMC members. Of the total \ndirect beneficiaries, 75% are expected to come from rural areas, about 25% will be females, and \nabout 40% will be from economically poor families. Poor communities will benefit mostly from \nthe livelihood programs, but also from DAE and trade programs since most poor students \ncannot afford general education. \n \n66.  The DAE and trade programs will benefit SMEs in by introducing improved learning \nmethods, resource materials, and modern equipment. The focus on practical application and \nlinkages with the industry for students and teachers will allow polytechnics and training centers \nto learn from industry, while giving industry skilled graduates. TEVT graduates could also work \nabroad, as many Pakistanis do, and remit the earnings. Livelihood training will give rural out-of-\nschool youths and adults job and self-employment skills. With NGO support, programs that are ", "  15\nin demand can be provided with great flexibility. TEVT graduates will be helped to access \nmicrocredit to start small ventures. All these measures will reduce poverty, especially in rural \nareas. The Project also gives women access to quality TEVT by strengthening polytechnic \ninstitutes and training centers, supporting the establishment of two new training centers, and \nconstructing facilities for five training centers for women.  \n \nB.  Project Risks \n \n67.  The  Project  faces  four  possible  risks:  financial,  institutional,  policy,  and  economic. \nAppendix 13 identifies potential risks and proposed mitigation measures. First, PGNWFP\u2019s effort \nto expand TEVT without consolidating and ensuring effective services at the existing training \ninstitutes could erode the financial base needed to run them. The Project helps strengthen the \ncapacity and increase the autonomy of TEVT institutions and seeks PGNWFP\u2019s assurances for \nadequate recurrent budgets and notification or directive to enable TEVT institutions to manage \ntheir financial resources. The economic, poverty impact, and financial analysis is in Appendix \n14. \n \n68.  Second, TEVT institutions lack the autonomy and leadership to allow them to meet labor \nmarket needs. While most TEVT institutions have IMCs or CMCs, few of these committees are \neffective due to weak governance structure and role of the principals. The Project includes a \nmanagement  development  program  and  PBMS  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  principals, \nteachers, and staff of TEVT institutions. The Project also supports capacity-building programs \nfor IMCs and CMCs, and provides modest financial assistance to make them more effective in \nsupporting TEVT institutions. \n \n69.  Third, the quality, management, and financing of TEVT programs can be improved only \nby improving plans, targets, and policy stipulations. The Project aims to implement innovative \nmeasures such as a quality assurance and accreditation system, PBMS, and examination \nreform, among others, to enable TEVT institutions to improve quality, relevance, efficiency, and \neffectiveness of their programs and operations. The Project also seeks PGNWFP\u2019s assurances \nto align key TEVT policies at the provincial level. \n \n70.  Fourth, the economy is not growing fast enough to absorb more graduates from TEVT \ninstitutions. Unless the private sector is engaged more actively, TEVT graduates will continue to \nhave difficulty finding jobs. The Project supports much greater involvement of the private sector \nthrough IMCs and CMCs, production units, guidance counseling, more organized labor market \ninformation, and credit facilitation for self-employment. \n \n1.  Environment \n \n71.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  categorization  is  \"C\"  as  the  initial  screening  has  not \nidentified any adverse environmental impacts. \n \n2.  Social Analysis \n \n72.  The Project aims to increase equity and effectiveness of TEVT programs by supporting \ntwo training centers and providing new facilities for five centers mainly for rural girls. The focus \non improving quality and organization of all TEVT institutions will benefit largely rural poor \nstudents. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy form is in Appendix 15. \n \n ", "16  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n73.  Assurances.  PGNWFP has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard \nones, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n74.  To  implement  new  initiatives  and  programs  to  improve  the  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency of the TEVT programs and institutions in accordance with the national policies on the \nTEVT  subsector,  PGNWFP  commits  to  issue  within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \nfollowing binding directive(s):  \n \n(i)  TEVT institutions in NWFP will (a) adopt the CBT system developed under the \nProject for selective subjects and courses in all trades and technologies; (b) \nrequire teachers of these subjects and courses to conduct practical examinations \nfollowing  CBT  principles  and  format;  (c)  develop  and  implement  on-the-job \ntraining programs as an integral part of the curriculum for all technologies and \ntrades; (d) encourage teachers to obtain industrial experience with pay as part of \nthe  ongoing  in-service  training  programs;  and  (e)  gradually  assume  more \nautonomy in the management and utilization of resources, including retention of \nrevenues to support their activities according to the PBMS to be introduced under \nthe Project. \n \n(ii)  DTE&MT  in  collaboration  with  the  PBTE  will  (a)  develop,  implement,  and \ninstitutionalize the equivalency and certification system in NWFP to provide more \nopportunities  and  greater  access  to  TEVT  for  the  out-of-school  youths  and \nadults;  and  (b)  develop,  implement,  and  institutionalize  an  accreditation  and \nquality assurance system to improve the quality of TEVT institutions in NWFP. \n \n75.  To ensure continuity, efficiency, and smooth implementation of the Project, PGNWFP \nagrees that the project director will be appointed for at least a term of 3 years. In case of an \nabsolute necessity to replace the project director, inter alia, due to unsatisfactory performance, \nPGNWFP will appoint a new one, on a competitive basis, whose qualifications, experience and \nexpertise are acceptable to ADB. \n \n76.  To ensure effective and timely implementation of the Project, PGNWFP commits that \nupon completion of the TEP, essential experienced staff of the TEP will be transferred to the \nPMU. \n \n77.  PGNWFP will sanction recruitment of necessary teaching and non-teaching staff for (i) \nany new training centers before procurement of equipment for and construction of such training \ncenters; and (ii) any new programs contemplated under the Project before commencement of \nthese  programs.  PGNWFP  will  start  recruitment  of  such  staff  immediately  after  the  (a) \nestablishment of new training centers; and (b) commencement of new programs. \n \n78.  PGNWFP agrees that the existing R&D cell will become part of the PMU. PGNWFP \nfurther agrees that immediately after the loan effectiveness (a) the R&D cell will be integrated \nunder DTE&MT, and (b) PGNWFP will be fully responsible for its expenses. \n \n79.  Unless  otherwise  agreed,  PGNWFP  will  ensure  that  within  9  months  of  loan \neffectiveness each TEVT institution will develop and submit for review and approval of DTE&MT ", "  17\na  5-year  institutional  development  plan  that  clearly  identifies  objectives,  targets,  staffing \nrequirements, capacity-building needs, and budgetary requirements to qualify for civil works, \nequipment, and other support from the Project. \n \n80.  PGNWFP will allocate and make available, in a timely manner, requisite counterpart \nfunds from its budget for each fiscal year for the smooth implementation of the Project.  \n \n81.  PGNWFP  will  ensure  that  within  11  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  to  enhance \ncompetitiveness of the polytechnics and training centers, DTE&MT will prepare for PGNWFP\u2019s \napproval a 5-year plan encompassing (i) TEVT rationalization, (ii) teacher career development, \nand (iii) gradual autonomy to TEVT institutions. PGNWFP commits that the implementation of \nsuch a plan will begin within a month after its approval. \n \n82.  PGNWFP commits to maintain the additional recurrent costs of approximately $370,000 \nequivalent required annually after the project completion on 31 October 2010 to sustain  the \nproject investments.  \n \n83.  PGNWFP will ensure that basic MIS and LMIS, including all baseline information, will be \nset up by the PMU within 12 months of loan effectiveness, with plans for further development \nduring the project period. \n \n84.  PGNWFP will ensure women's participation in project implementation in accordance with \nthe gender strategy set out in Appendix 15. Based on the gender strategy, a gender action plan \nto  improve  gender  imbalances  in  the  TEVT  subsector  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  and \napproved and implemented by DTE&MT within 12 months of loan effectiveness. PGNWFP will \nattempt to ensure that at least 50% of the livelihood training programs will include women. \n \n85.  PGNWFP confirms that all required land for the Project is PGNWFP\u2019s land, free from \nany encumbrances, structures, human settlements, or cultivation. PGNWFP further confirms \nthat the Project will not entail any land acquisition or resettlement and that no persons will be \nadversely affected in terms of ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous People.  \n \n86.  PGNWFP will ensure that adequate environmental protection and safety measures will \nbe  included  in  the  design  of  the  project  facilities,  and  that  the  project  facilities  will  be  \nconstructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy.  \nPGNWFP will ensure implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures as set out in \nthe Initial Environmental Examination carried out for the Project. \n \n87.  PGNWFP will support and encourage public-private partnerships in the sharing and \nutilization of resources of TEVT institutions, such as management of production-cum-service \ncenters; delivery of nonformal livelihood training programs, operation of second shift in TEVT \ninstitutions; and establishment of DMCs and provision of seed money to DMCs, IMCs, and \nCMCs. \n \nB.  Conditions of Loan Effectiveness \n \n88.  The project director for the PMU, whose qualifications, experience, and expertise are \nacceptable to ADB, will be selected and appointed on a competitive basis. \n \n89.  The PMU will be fully staffed and become functional. \n ", "18  \n90.  The  PMU  will  prepare  and  submit  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  the  shortlist  of \ncandidates, terms of reference, and invitation letters for the management development contract.  \n \n91.  Planning Commission Performa-1 will be approved by the competent authorities. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n92.

General Education \n \n1.  General education in Pakistan is divided into elementary, secondary, higher-secondary, \nand higher education. Elementary education is subdivided into primary (grades 1\u20135) and middle \nlevels (grades 6\u20138). The secondary level comprises grades 6\u201310, and the higher-secondary \nlevel, grades 11\u201312. A bachelor\u2019s degree in general science or humanities takes another 2 \nyears after higher-secondary school, for a total of 14 years, while engineering and medicine \nprograms are longer. \n \n2.  The Ministry of Education is responsible for policy, planning, and overall educational \nstandards at the federal level. The ministry also has control over the curriculum for grades 1\u201312. \nThe  departments  of  education  are  responsible  at  the  provincial  level.  Recently,  this \nresponsibility has been devolved to the district level, where the executive district officer for \neducation supervises and promotes education.  \n   \nB.  Technical Education and Vocational Training  \n \n3.  Technical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) has three subcomponents: school \nlevel prevocational, post grade 8 level TEVT, and higher-level engineering and technology \neducation. The introduction and integration of prevocational and vocational courses into general \nschool education dates back to the early 1950s, and many experiments have been done at this \nlevel. However, these efforts haven\u2019t made a significant dent in general school education, which \nsince colonial rule has been geared to produce clerks and other office workers rather than \ntechnicians, engineers, and scientists. The education policy of 1972\u20131980 suggested a major \nshift from general education and emphasized relating education to the world of work. This \nresulted in the introduction of agro-technical studies (wood work, metal work, and electricity) in \nurban, agriculture in rural, and home economics in girls\u2019 middle schools in grades 6\u20138. In grades \n9\u201310 the introduction of vocational courses such as agriculture, commerce, home economics, \nand  industrial  arts  was  encouraged.  More  recently,  this  approach  is  reaffirmed  under  the \nNational Education Policy and Education Sector Reform Program. \n \n4.  The rapid growth of the TEVT subsector is due to the Government\u2019s desire to increase \naccess of rural youths and women to TEVT to improve their job skills and means of livelihood. \nThe lack of places in the universities also led to further expansion of the subsector, as it became \nan alternative channel for the youth and school leavers. This increased demand for TEVT. All \nthrough the years, the Government was mainly responsible for providing TEVT to youths, with \nlittle private sector participation. Only during the last few years has the private sector been \nencouraged to provide TEVT, through, for example, incentives under the Education Sector \nReform Program. \n \n5.  Vocational Training. Vocational training caters to unemployed, unskilled youths and \nthose who either drop out of school or fail to qualify for admission to the polytechnic institutes \nand colleges. Vocational training expanded in 1980\u20131990, when several training centers were \nestablished and number of old ones upgraded. The Ministry of Youth Affairs also established 20 \nyouth vocational centers. The National Training Ordinance in 1980 expanded vocational training \nand established the National Training Board and provincial training boards to improve vocational \ntraining, start training women in nontraditional trades, and closely involve employers in planning \nand administering vocational training.  \n   \n ", "24   Appendix 3    \n \n6.  The duration of and entry qualifications for different vocational training programs vary \nwidely. Training programs range from a few weeks to 2 years, and entry qualifications vary from \nmiddle- to secondary-school pass. With 80% practice and 20% theory, vocational courses are \nmore practical than technical education. Graduates are expected to perform semiskilled and \nskilled jobs in various sectors or to be self-employed. \n \n7.  North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) has 38 technical and vocational training centers: \n12 vocational training centers for boys, 15 government technical and vocational centers, and 11 \ngovernment vocational training centers for women. These centers offer training in 17 trades. \nExcept  for  a  few  well-established  training  centers  such  as  the  government  technical  and \nvocational center in Peshawar, with about 850 trainees in 11 trades in day and evening shifts, \nmost are small and offer traditional trades, ranging from 6 months to 1 year. Thirteen of these \ntraining centers (eight for girls and five for boys) are in rented houses or old facilities and have \nlimited training capacity and equipment. While facilities are limited, instructional materials are \neven scarcer. A training cost analysis in 2001\u20132002 showed that each girl trainee was provided \na  total  of  PRs41  for  instructional  materials,  compared  to  Rs158  for  boys.  In  2002,  3,752 \nstudents enrolled in the centers\u2014506 for diplomas and 3,246 for certificates. The centers had \n389 teaching staff members. \n \n8.  Technical Education. Technical education refers to postsecondary training of middle-\nlevel supervisory technicians carried out in polytechnic institutes. These technicians serve as a \nlink between engineers and technologists on the top and skilled and semiskilled workers below \nthem. The rapid growth of the TEVT subsector was the result of the Government\u2019s desire to \nincrease access of rural youth and women to TEVT to improve their job skills and means of \nlivelihood. The lack of places in universities also led to expansion of the subsector, as it became \nan alternative channel for the youth and school leavers. This resulted in increasing demand for \nTEVT.  \n \n9.  A three-year course leading to a diploma of associate engineer (DAE) is the main \npolytechnic program. The curriculum comprises 60% practice and 40% theory. The polytechnic \ninstitutes offer a wide range of training in traditional as well as new and emerging technologies. \nThe bigger institutes offer up to eight technologies. NWFP has 12 polytechnics, with about \n4,500 students and 450 teachers. For a province with over 20 million people, this is inadequate, \nand much fewer women enroll than in Punjab and Sindh. \n \n10.  DAE holders\u2019 persistent demand for extension of facilities to higher education resulted in \nthe introduction in the late 1970s of the bachelor\u2019s degree in technology (B. Tech.) throughout \nthe country. The B. Tech (pass course) is two years\u2014one year on the job and one year \nteaching; and the B. Tech. (honors) is two years\u2014one year on the job and one year schooling. \nFor offering a B. Tech program, a number of polytechnic institutes were upgraded to colleges of \ntechnology. The program is offered only by colleges of technology through affiliation with a \nrecognized university in the province. This initiative is considered important as it (i) allows DAE \ngraduates to train further; and (ii) upgrades DAE teachers\u2019 qualifications, as about 50% have \nonly DAEs. \n \nC.  Governance, Structure, and Management of Technical Education and Vocational \nTraining \n \n11.  In NWFP the Government has initiated major structural changes in TEVT system. First, \nthe  directorates  of  technical  education  and  of  manpower  training  were  merged  into  the \nDirectorate of Technical Education and Manpower Training (DTE&MT) at the beginning of 2002 \nunder  the  Department  of  Industries  (DOI).  Then  in  September  the  TEVT  Authority  was \n ", "  Appendix 3   25\nestablished as an autonomous body with powers to take over all polytechnics, commerce \ncolleges, technical and vocational training centers, and similar institutes.  \n \n12.  Restructuring can be complicated, needing political will. Massive support will be needed \nfor the new system to fulfill its mandate and aspirations.  \n \nE.  Demand and Supply of Skilled Workers and Technicians \n \n13.  Traditionally most TEVT institutions, particularly the polytechnics, were established to \ntrain the workforce for Government departments and public sector organizations. Until recently \nend users have not been involved in the operation, management, and program delivery, and \ncourse  have  not  been  aligned  to  industries\u2019  needs.  TEVT  institutions  have  thus  become \nmarginalized, with employers showing little interest in cooperating with the institutions due to \nlack of interaction between them and industries.  \n \n14.  A labor market survey conducted in 2003 under an Asian Development Bank advisory \ntechnical assistance found that, first, graduates identified lack of industrial training skills and \ninadequate practical content as a key weakness of TEVT programs, followed by shortage of \nequipment, insufficient consumables and learning materials, and poorly prepared teachers. \nMost enterprises rated practical skills, troubleshooting, report writing and communication skills, \nand safety consciousness as poor. Finally, graduates who were hired had to be trained for 3 \nmore months by their employers. \n \n15.  Second,  future  demand  for  skilled  workers  and  technicians  is  high  in  electrical, \nmechanical, electronics, computer and information, telecommunication courses, and moderate \nin  civil  works  and  construction,  auto  and  diesel,  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning,  plastic, \nrubber, and petroleum trades and technologies. \n \n16.  Third, TEVT skills are mismatched with those required by the industry due to dated \ncurriculum; lack of trained teachers; shortage of funds; an inflexible training system; and lack of \ntraining in practical aspects, troubleshooting, report writing, and communication. \n \nE.  Key Issues and Challenges  \n \n17.  Several  areas  need  improvement.  First,  TEVT  programs  should  be  consolidated  to \nensure that they are organized and managed effectively to meet the needs of the local and \nforeign labor markets. Second, as the private sector\u2019s involvement in TEVT is limited, the \nprovincial government of North-West Frontier Province (PGNWFP) needs to improve TEVT, \nparticularly  for  women  and  the  rural  poor,  through  policy  reforms,  regulation,  targeted \ninvestments, monitoring and evaluation, and a greater role for nongovernment organizations \nand the private sector. Third, PGNWFP needs to link TEVT with industry, make TEVT programs \npractical, provide labor market information and counseling to TEVT students and graduates, \nemploy  performance-based  management  to  target  funds,  and  be  flexible  about  changing \nteaching and learning. Finally, TEVT institutions should have autonomy, which will promote \neffective leadership and performance-based management and allow TEVT providers to become \nmore responsive and competitive. \n \n \n ", "26   Appendix 4 \nLESSONS LEARNED \n \nLessons Learned  Incorporations of the Lessons in Project Design \n   \nProject Design and Processing   \n   \n1.

National Education Policy \n \n1.  The National Education Policy (1998\u20132010) stipulates 19 provisions for technical education \nand vocational training (TEVT). These can be grouped into seven policy areas: (i) improving \nplanning, management, coordination, and institutional development; (ii) encouraging need- and \nperformance-based funding, cost recovery for self-reliance, and private sector participation in \nTEVT  provision;  (iii)  strengthening  evaluation,  examinations,  and  accreditation  of  TEVT \nprograms and institutions; (iv) improving the skills and qualifications of teachers through in-\nservice training and provision of liberal in-service training facilities; (v) regular revision and \nupgrading of curricula; introduction of emerging technologies, including computer education as a \ncompulsory component of technical education; introduction of a modular approach to continuing \nTEVT education; and development of teaching-learning resource materials by TEVT teachers; \n(vi) increasing equity and access to TEVT by establishing new institutions, conducting distance \nand continuing education, broadening the base for TEVT by introducing a new technical stream \nof  matriculation  (technical)  and  extending  opportunities  for  further  education  for  TEVT \ngraduates;  and  (vii)  improving  TEVT  quality  by  refurbishing  and  modernizing  laboratories, \nworkshops, and training equipment. \n \nB.  Policy Reform Proposed Under the Project \n \n2.  These stipulations directly affect TEVT development under the Project. In particular, the \nProject will improve the quality of TEVT and expand it modestly in strategic areas to (i) train \nworkers to meet industry\u2019s emerging needs, (ii) make TEVT graduates more employable, (iii) \ndesign TEVT programs to train workers for self-employment and for industry, (iv) teach students \nrelevant technical skills and instill in them a work ethic, (v) establish an evaluation system that \nemphasizes practical skills and project orientation, (vi) promote institution-industry linkages, and \n(vii) impart employable skills through nonformal livelihood training programs. \n \n3.  Other policy implications from the Project have been incorporated into the framework. For \nexample, resource implications must be incorporated to achieve these policies. The target for \nhigher budgetary allocation by mid-term as a percentage of allocations to TEVT will be carefully \nstudied and reflected as appropriate. \n ", "  Appendix 6  31 \nPOLICY REFORM UNDER THE PROJECT \n \nGovernment\u2019s Policies on  Policy Reform Proposed in  Actions to be Taken by \nTEVT Subsector  Project Design  Government \n1.

Economic Analysis  \n \n1.  Economic  Rationale.  Pakistan  has  562  public  technical  education  and  vocational \ntraining (TEVT) institutions, unevenly distributed across the provinces. About 85% are in Punjab \nand Sindh, and the rest in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Balochistan. One TEVT \ninstitution is built for every 311,000 people in Punjab, 142,000 in Sindh, 266,000 in NWFP, and \n535,000 in Balochistan (Table A15.1). When private TEVT institutions are included, Balochistan \nlags even further behind. \n \nTable A14.1: Distribution of Population and TEVT Institutions in Pakistan \n \nItem  Pakistan  Punjab  Sindh  NWFP  Balochistan \nPopulation (\u2018000) (A)  136,372  78,387  32,104  18,925  6,956 \nTEVT Institutions (B)  562  252  226  71  13 \nPolytechnics  77  25  37  12  2 \nTVTCs  253  109  95  38  11 \nOther  232  118  94  21   \nPopulation\u2013\nTEVT \nInstitution \nRatio (A/B)  242,000  311,000  142,000   266,000   535,000 \nTEVT = technical education and vocational training, TVTC = technical and vocational training. \nSource:  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Repubic of Pakistan for Skills Development Reform \nProject, Manila.  \n \n2.  TEVT problems in NWFP are not only distribution and number of institutions but also \ntheir inefficiency and inability to meet labor market demands. NWFP has about 700 enterprises, \nspecializing in mineral resources processing; food processing and woodwork; and chemical, \nelectrical, and mechanical engineering. The market survey indicates that enterprises will need \nmore  graduates  from  polytechnics,  technical  training  centers  and  technical  and  vocational \ntraining  centers  (TVTCs),  and  short-term  training.  The  labor  force  required  for  the  local \nenterprises has been supplied by 12 polytechnics and 38 public TVTCs and 95 private TEVT \ninstitutions. However, TEVT does not fully cover the areas and level of skills in demand. As \nfacilities and equipment are outdated, TEVT institutions are unable to provide students and \ntrainees with updated training. As a result, the completion rate is less than 50%, and the \ntransition rate from graduation to employment, 30%. \n \n3.  Insufficient physical capacity of TEVT institutions, high internal inefficiency as a result of \nlow-quality TEVT, and high external inefficiency due to skill mismatch warrant investment in \nTEVT. While private TEVT institutions outnumber public ones, more students and trainees were \nenrolled in the public ones in 2001 (Table A14.2). On average, one public TEVT institution \nenrolls more students and trainees than a private one, making the public sector more efficient. \nAs private polytechnics are limited, the provincial government of NWFP (PGNWFP) should \ninvest  in  public  polytechnics.  However,  with  greater  autonomy  and  in  partnership  with  the \nprivate sector, public TEVT institutions could become much more efficient. \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 14 \n \nTable A14.2: Technical Education and Vocational Training Institutions \nin North-West Frontier Province in 2001 \n \nItem  Institutions (A)  Enrollment (B)  Ratio (B/A) \nPublic Sector       \nPolytechnic Institutes    12    5,414    451 \nTTC/TVTCs    38    3,752    99 \nOther    21    4,957    236 \nSubtotal (A)    71    14,123    199 \nPrivate Sector       \nPolytechnic Institutes    27    5,730    212 \nTTC/VTCs    41    1,490    36 \nOther    27    3,750    139 \nSubtotal (B)    95    10,970    115 \n      Total (A+B)    166    25,093    151 \nTTC = technical training center, TVTC = technical and vocational training. \nSource:  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Repubic of Pakistan for Skills Development    Reform \nProject, Manila.  \n \n4.  Consideration of Design Alternatives. The Project faced two options: (i) support large-\nscale expansion, given the Government\u2019s ambitious plan of providing TEVT to the districts and \ntahsils; or (ii) focus on ensuring effective functioning of existing facilities before embarking on \nlarge-scale expansion. While large-scale expansion would be in line with the Government\u2019s \nperspective  plan  of  2001\u20132011  and  education  sector  reform  (2001-2005),  and  would  be \nsupported by the PGNWFP, such an approach would be difficult to sustain due to limited \nbudgets available for essential recurrent expenditures and lack of effective TEVT institutional \nmodels.  The  Project  has,  therefore,  taken  the  middle  path  of  cautious  expansion  while \nconsolidating existing TEVT institutions, as NWFP offers significantly less access to TEVT than \nPunjab and Sindh, particularly to women and the rural poor. The balance between cautious \nexpansion and consolidation allows PGNWFP to improve the quality and efficiency of existing \nTEVT institutions, with limited expansion in the most viable towns and districts, focusing on \nwomen and the rural poor. \n   \n5.  An investment loan is proposed since PGNWFP is not yet ready to embark on a more \ncomplex design. Given the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the two \nprevious projects for TEVT, persistent problems must be solved. First, a project approach allows \na simple design emphasizing policy reform. Second, Pakistan is trying to bring TEVT institutions \nunder one organization. Punjab is leading in this effort by bringing all TEVT activities under the \nTEVT authority (TEVTA), and other provinces are watching this development closely. While \nPGNWFP  has  already  brought  TEVT  under  the  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  and \nManpower Training (DTE&MT) of the Department of Industries (DOI), it needs to consolidate \nTEVT  programs  and  improve  institutional  efficiency  before  implementing  a  TEVTA-type \narrangement. Third, the devolution policy is changing many government services but not yet \nTEVT  provision.  Therefore,  PGNWFP  should  be  encouraged  to  allow  TEVT  institutions  to \nbecome  autonomous,  competitive,  and  responsive  to  labor  market  needs.  Finally,  some \nfundamental  elements  for  making  TEVT  institutions  more  effective,  such  as  public-private \npartnership, counseling services, and exposure of teachers to industries, can be achieved under \na simple investment loan. \n \n6.  The Project\u2019s first component will make TEVT institutions responsive to labor market \nneeds through autonomy, performance-based management, and management development \nprograms.  The  second  component  will  improve  TEVT  quality  through  teacher  training  and \ncompetency-based training (CBT), which are supported by the National Institute for Science and \nTechnical Education. CBT will allow aligning training with the needs of the private sector and \n ", "  Appendix 14  47\nindustries. The Project provides materials to support this approach. The third component will \nestablish equivalency and certification, benefiting many trained and experienced people who \nwant further training or better-paying jobs. This component also provides opportunities to out-of-\nschool youths and adults to seek livelihood training. With limited support to new institutions, \naccess to polytechnics and TVTCs can be increased. \n \n7.  Economic Internal Rate of Return. To assess the investment\u2019s economic viability and \nefficiency, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 25 years was estimated. Three major \neconomic project benefits are (i) increased access to TEVT institutions, (ii) improved internal \nefficiency, and (iii) improved external efficiency. Their impacts are presented in monetary value \nby using estimated future salary increments5 of TEVT students and trainees as a result of \ncompleting an additional year of TEVT under the Project. \n \n8.  Increased access is represented by growth in enrollment due to new TEVT institutions, \ntechnologies, and training programs and courses. The Project will allow 200 more enrollees a \nyear in polytechnics, 600 in TVTCs and colleges, and 10,000 in short-term training courses and \nprograms. Polytechnic and TVTC students will learn the skills and acquire the work ethic that \nwill increase their annual earning by $83 throughout their working life. Trainees in short courses \nwill add $9 a year to their salary throughout their working life. \n \n9.  Improvement  in  internal  efficiency  is  measured  by  the  difference  in  polytechnics\u2019 \ncompletion  rates  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios,  assuming  that  newly  designed \ncourses and better institutional management will improve delivery of education and training, \nand, hence, the completion rate. During the Project, the completion rate in polytechnics is \nestimated to improve by approximately 20%, gradually from 46% to 55%. \n \n10.  Improved external efficiency is measured by the difference in employment rate of those \nwho complete TEVT under with- and without-project scenarios, assuming that new educational \ncontent,  new  institutional  management  systems,  and  counseling  give  students  more  job \nopportunities. Immediately after graduation 70% of students cannot find jobs and have to wait \nabout  1.5  years  to  be  employed.  During  the  Project,  the  graduates\u2019  employment  rate  is \nestimated to rise gradually from 30% to 60%, allowing 30% of graduates a year to generate \nincome, which will benefit the economy by $1,407 (polytechnic graduates) and $1,227 (TVTC \ngraduates) per year. \n \n11.  The Project, however, has investment, recurrent, and private and opportunity costs. It is \nestimated at $39.7 million. Recurrent cost will gradually increase from $52,000 to $367,600 \nduring  the Project,  covering  the salary  of  additional  administrative  and  teaching  staff,  and \noperation and maintenance expenses of new organizations and institutions. The recurrent cost \nwill remain at $367,600 after the Project, and $55,900 more will be incurred every 5 years after \nthe Project to cover major maintenance of project buildings. Private cost includes students\u2019 and \ntrainees\u2019  out-of-pocket  expenses  to  continue  TEVT  and  is  estimated  at  $33  per  year.6 \nOpportunity cost is equivalent to the income that a student or trainee otherwise would receive if \nhe or she did not undergo TEVT, estimated at $1,145 for polytechnic and TVTC students. \nPrivate and opportunity costs of a short-term training program trainee are assumed at zero, \nsince locally provided training does not incur considerable private cost, and most trainees are \nlikely to be unemployed. \n                                                 \n5  Earning level was estimated by using earning functions developed by Zafar Mueen Nasir and Hina Nazli in \nPakistan Institute of Development Economics. 2000.

Sensitivity  Analysis.  A  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  undertaken  on  the  basis  of \nalternative assumptions regarding the extent to which the Project will improve access, and \ninternal and external efficiency. The project targets are that 10,800 additional students enroll7 \nper  year,  55%  more  complete  their  courses,  and  60%  fewer  are  jobless.  Alternative \nassumptions  were  tested  by  employing  extreme  values:  the  \u201clow\u201d  case  representing \nimprovement 50% lower than the target, and the \u201chigh\u201d case 50% higher. In the low case, the \ntargets are reduced to 5,400 students for additional enrollment, 51% completion rate, and 45% \nemployment rate. For the high case, the targets are increased to 16,200, 60%, and 75%, \nrespectively (Table A14.5). \n                                                 \n7  Comprising 200 enrollees to polytechnics, 600 to TVTCs and colleges, and 10,000 to short-term training courses \nand programs per year. \n ", "50  Appendix 14 \nTable A14.5: Sensitivity Analysis \n(percent) \n  Low Case  Normal Case  High Case \nIncrease in Access    14.1    17.2    20.1 \n     Degree of Change    (18%)    0%    +17% \nInternal Efficiency    13.3    17.2    21.2 \n     Degree of change    (23%)    0%    +23% \nExternal Efficiency    8.5    17.2    25.8 \n     Degree of change    (51%)    0%    +50% \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  The  results  indicate  that  the  Project  will  substantially  benefit  the  economy  when \nimprovement exceeds targets. An excessive increase in access, however, may replicate the \ncurrent situation, where enrollment exceeds capacity, resulting in overcrowded classes and low-\nquality education and training. The Project is highly sensitive to external efficiency. A small \ndecline in improvement in access could render the Project economically nonviable. The Project \nmust achieve at least the 70% target in external efficiency. The minimum targets required for \neconomic viability are likely to be achieved through provision of sufficient updated training \nequipment and learning materials, and extensive job counseling and placement in each project \ndistrict. \n \nA.  Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n15.  The Project will reduce poverty by giving young people opportunities to earn through \ntraining, guidance, and job placement programs. The direct project beneficiaries are students \nand trainees in polytechnics, TVTCs, and training programs. The poverty line in Pakistan is \nbased  on  a  norm  of  2,350  calories  per  adult  daily  equivalent  and  minimum  nonfood \nrequirements, and approximates $160 per year8. Those who complete 1-year training in TVTCs \nwill likely earn about $166 more than those without training. Those who complete the 3-year \npolytechnic course will likely earn about $500 more than those who do not. Thus, the annual \nsalary  increments  due  to  completion  of  polytechnic  and  TVTC  training,  coupled  with \nemployment, will increase earning levels well above the poverty line. \n \n16.  In the absence of statistics, the proportion of poor students and trainees is assumed to \nbe the same as that of the poor in the province. Student selection procedures in polytechnics \nand the geographical distribution of TVTCs are also assumed to reflect the rural and urban \ndistribution of the provincial population: 17% of students and trainees were estimated to be from \nthe urban region, and 83% from the rural region in 1999, and poverty incidence was estimated \nat 31% and 44%, respectively, in 2001. About 42% of students and trainees were from poor \nfamilies in 1999\u20132001 (Table A14.6), so at least 42% of polytechnic and TVTC students are \nfrom poor families. \n \nTable A14.6: Population and Poverty in NWFP \n(percent) \n  Regions  Provincial \n  Urban  Rural   Total \nPopulation (A)    16.9  83.1  100 \nPoverty Incidence in Region (B)    31.2  44.3   \nPoverty Incidence in Province (AxB)    5.3  36.8  42.1 \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Government of Pakistan. 2003.

The  poverty  incidence  for  students  and  trainees  in  polytechnics  and  TVTCs  could, \nhowever,  be  underestimated.  TEVT  students  are  more  likely  to  be  poorer  than  general-\neducation students. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n18.  The TEVT sector is financed by DTE&MT. It was established in 2003, so only 2 years of \nrecords are available. The total recurrent budget for TEVT in FY2004 is PRs366 million, of \nwhich 70% is recurrent budget. The sector budget level has been generally stagnant, slightly \nreduced in size and proportion to PGNWFP expenditure for the last 2 financial years. \n \nTable A14.7: Education, Manpower and Labor Management Budget FY2001\u20132004 \n(PRs in million) \n \nItem  FY1999  FY2000  FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004 \nProvincial Government of NWFP             \nDevelopment Budget  4,927 3,995 9,237  7,986   8,909    9,305  \nRecurrent Budget  33,001  35,493 39,132 45,040b  48,564b  47,115b \nTotal  37,928 39,488 48,369  53,026   57,473   56,420 \n(Annual Growth)    4%    22%     10%  8%  (1%) \n     \nDirectorate of Technical Education and \nManpower     \nDevelopment Budget            195     113  \nRecurrent Budget            269    253  \nTotal            464    366 \n(proportion to government expenditure)            0.7%     0.5% \nFY = fiscal year, NWFP = North-West Frontier Province. \nNote:  Due to limited availability of records, the recurrent budget figures are from the original budget, and the \ndevelopment budget was from http://www.nwfpfinance.com/ and financial records of DTEM.

The  Project\u2019s  affordability  and  sustainability  are  analyzed.  Due  to  limited  official \nprovincial budget forecasts and plans and lack of budgetary records, the financial analysis had \nto compare the total provincial budget growth rates and the required budget growth rate for \nTEVT.  The  Project  is  estimated  to  incur  additional  recurrent  expenditure  at  approximately \nPRs21 million after the Project. DTE&MT\u2019s recurrent budget needs to be increased annually by \n1% (8% in 6 years) during the Project. Comparing provincial budgets, which have increased \nfrom 4% to 22%, the DTE&MT budget will most likely increase by 1% annually provided DOI \nand DTE&MT consolidate and prioritize TEVT investments. Although the provincial budget in \nFY2004 declines slightly, PGNWFP favors allocating budget for increased recurrent expenditure \nduring and after the Project. \n ", " 52 Appendix 15 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the County Poverty Analysis   \nSector identified as a national     Yes  Country identified as a   Yes \nnational priority in country \npriority in country poverty     No    No \npoverty partnership \nanalysis  \nagreement \nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nGiven the strong linkage between poverty and low level of human development as measured by the human \ndevelopment index, the Government of Pakistan sets as a major objective to \u201caccelerate GDP growth, reduce \nunemployment,  and  alleviate  property\u201d  in  its  Ten-Year  Perspective  Development  Plan  (the  Plan).  The \nGovernment\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of December 2003 recognizes education as a key \npillar for sustainable economic growth. Education is seen as key to improve the quality of life and to provide \nstudents  with  employable  skills.  In  particular,  the  Government  recognizes  basic  education  and  skills \ndevelopment as key to reduce poverty. The Plan and PRSP identify priority areas for the education sector: (i) \nimprovement of the literacy rate, (ii) education for all, (iii) improvement in secondary-level enrollment, (iv) \nproduction of higher-education graduates responsive to the country\u2019s socioeconomic and technical needs, \nand (v) improvement of education quality. \n \nTechnical education and vocational training (TEVT) is prominent in the Plan and PRSP as a strategy to \nproduce skilled workers who will make the country competitive. The National Education Policy sets targets to \nexpand TEVT facilities and allow more people to enroll in quality TEVT. In addition to establishing more \ntechnical institutes across the country, especially in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), where TEVT \nfacilities and opportunities are still limited, the Government plans to introduce job-oriented education and \ntraining in secondary schools throughout the country. To expand the skilled workforce, the Government has \nintroduced a technical stream in 1,100 high schools to increase the number of students who choose to study \ntechnical, commercial, and vocational subjects, from 35% to 50% by  2011. Facilities at high schools, \ntechnical and vocational training centers (TVTCs), commercial colleges, and polytechnics are being used to \nconduct  evening  programs  for  out-of-school  youths  and  dropouts.  These  activities  directly  help  the \nGovernment reduce poverty by expanding access to TEVT. \n \nThe Project\u2019s goal is to help reduce poverty in NWFP by providing quality and relevant skill development \nprograms  and  increasing  access  to  TEVT.  The  Project\u2019s  specific  objectives  are  to  (i)  restructure  and \nstrengthen institutional capacity and autonomy of TEVT institutions; (ii) improve the quality and relevance of \nTEVT programs; and (iii) enhance access and equity to TEVT, especially for women and the rural poor. The \nProject will create jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises by giving graduates access to microcredit. \n \nTwo new vocational training centers for girls will be established in poor areas. Five of the eight existing \ncenters for girls will receive new facilities in seven rural districts. Facilities, equipment, and training programs \nof all 13 existing centers will also be upgraded. About 160 trainees a year will benefit from these centers\u2019 \nprograms. Overall, 500\u20132,000 trainees will directly benefit from TEVT programs offered by centers covered \nby the Project. As about 500 polytechnic graduates are expected to access microcredit to start their own \nbusiness, and thus support their families and create jobs, the Project\u2019s economic impact and benefits will be \nsubstantial. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Targeted Classification: Targeted Intervention \nIn the past decade poverty has increased sharply due to slow economic growth, declining development \nspending, and low agricultural outputs because of a severe drought. The proportion of the poor (those who \nconsume 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day, or an equivalent amount of PRs. 670 per capita per \nmonth in 1999 value) increased from 26.6% in FY1993 to 32.2% in FY1999, and deteriorated to 38.2% in \nFY2003. Rural poverty is normally higher than urban poverty. Over three fourths of the poor live in rural \nareas. Although poverty increased in all four provinces, it varied in different parts of the country. In 1998/99 \nurban Sindh had the least poverty (16%) while rural NWFP had the highest (42%). The poor are mainly \nilliterate, have big families and nonworking heads of household, and lack physical assets such as land or \nlivestock. Poverty is highest among households whose heads are day laborers in agriculture, construction, ", "  Appendix 15  53\ntrade, and transport. Poverty is also high among the self-employed, including urban street vendors and \nsharecroppers. \n \nBesides the economic slowdown and negligible increase in per capita income, the causes of poverty also \ninclude (i) limited job growth and absorptive capacity of the formal sector; (ii) few opportunities for unskilled \nyouth to obtain on-the-job training and skills; and (iii) low quality of social services, particularly education and \nhealth services. \n \nThe proportion of literate heads of poor households is almost half that for nonpoor households. Access to \nurban jobs reduces poverty by 45%, while education and physical assets reduce it by 12% and 9%. Social \nDevelopment in Pakistan towards Poverty Reduction Investing in education and training to prepare students, \nincluding those who have not undergone formal education, for employment will directly reduce poverty, \nespecially in villages and districts that lack education facilities. \n \nEducational opportunities are limited, especially in rural areas. The Mahbub-ul-Haq Center for Human \nDevelopment has developed a broad index of poverty that takes into account deprivation in education and \nhealth, in addition to income. Poverty of education opportunities consistently ranked the highest: 77% in 1970 \nand 58% in 1995. Pakistan has approximately 41 million adult illiterates, and their ranks increase every year. \nLess than 50% of rural girls 10\u201314 years old are in school, and over 30% of all children are unlikely to attend \nschool.  \n \nThe Project will rural TEVT to reach about 20,000 out-of school youths and adults who want to acquire job \nskills  or  start  their  own  business.  Nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  plan  and  implement  the \nlivelihood programs. Training needs and trades will be identified that will meet local and foreign needs. The \nProject\u2019s linkages with an Asian Development Bank-supported credit project will give TEVT graduates access \nto microcredit for small business and self-employment.  \n \nB.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?      Yes     No   \nIs there a participation strategy?      Yes     No \nStakeholder Analysis: \n \nThe Project was formulated after extensive consultations with all stakeholders, including the Government, \nprovincial  government  of  NWFP,  and  key  government  agencies  responsible  for  TEVT  planning  and \nmanagement. In NWFP consultations and discussions were carried out with key officials of Planning and \nDevelopment Department, Department of Industries, Directorate of Technical Education and Manpower \nTraining (DTE&MT), and the chair of the Board of Technical Education. Consultations were also carried out \nwith administrators, teachers, students, community leaders, development partners, and the president of SME \nBank, among others, and with NGOs and representatives of public and private TEVT institutions.  \n \nNGO involvement in a situation analysis of vocational training needs and trades with potential trainees and \nlocal stakeholders will facilitate a participatory process for designing and implanting TEVT and livelihood \nprograms. Participation of various stakeholders, including the private sector, will enable the provinces and \nTEVT institutions to implement these activities effectively. \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nGender discrimination is a key factor associated with poverty. More women than men are poor. Women also \nhave less land and productive assets, and suffer more unemployment, discrimination in the labor market, and \nlimited access to economic options and the political process. Discrimination against women exists in almost \nall spheres of life, but is most profound in education and worse in NWFP than in the rest of the country. The \nnational female literacy rate is only 29% compared to 55% for men. TEVT facilities and opportunities for \nwomen are equally limited. Of the 77 polytechnic institutes in the country only 10 are for women. The number \nof  vocational  training  centers  for  girls  is  almost  equal  to  that  for  boys,  but  the  number  of  trades  or \ntechnologies offered to girls is limited, and enrollments are also lower in the training centers for girls. Apart \nfrom cultural factors, socioeconomic factors are to blame: in some rural training centers for girls, lack of public \ntransportation is a big obstacle and can prevent girls from enrolling. \n ", "54  Appendix 15 \nIn NWFP, of the 12 polytechnic institutes, including 1 Government College of Technology, only 1 is for \nwomen. Of the 38 TVTCs only 11 are for females. Of the 11 vocational training centers for girls, 8 are in ill-\nequipped  rented  facilities,  some  outside  the  main  community  centers.  Lack  of  transportation  and \naccommodation also discourages girls who want to study at the centers. NWFP intends to remedy these \nproblems under the Project and to improve technical and vocational training centers. In particular, the Project \nwill upgrade facilities and equipment, train teachers, provide instructional materials, and establish career \nguidance and counseling centers. \n \nGender Plan \n \nSeveral project measures are being proposed to give girls, especially in rural areas, access to TEVT. \n \nTraining facilities and equipment at vocational training centers for girls will be upgraded. Initially, the centers \nnow housed in rented facilities will be provided with their own facilities and equipment, and instructional \nmaterials upgraded. New programs will also give girls better career choices. \n \nThe Project will establish two new vocational centers, among other measures, to expand girls\u2019 opportunities \nto take up TEVT, especially in rural areas. The following is a summary of interventions: \n \n(i) Two new vocational training centers for girls will be established at Chitral and Karak. Computer and \ninformation technology, telecommunication technology, and biotechnology will be introduced to the girls to \nexpose them to emerging technologies and enhance their job prospects. \n \n(ii) Girls and boys undergoing TEVT will gain experience through on-the-job training and train to use \nmicrocredit and become self-employed. A career guidance and job placement center in each training center \nwill help girls prepare for and look for jobs after graduation.  \n \n(iii) Nonformal livelihood skill improvement programs will target 20,000 rural trainees, at least half of whom \nwill be girls or women. NGOs will identify training needs for new skills and upgrading of traditional skills. \n \n(iv) To enable poor students, especially females, from rural and remote areas, to attend TEVT, training will be \nconducted  in  the  communities.  If  this  is  not  possible,  students  will  be  housed  in  hostels  or  other \naccommodation in areas with facilities. \n \n(v) The project management unit (PMU) and partner NGOs will involve female representatives of union and \ndistrict councils in situation analysis and in planning and implementation of TEVT and livelihood programs. \nThe PMU will include women staff in its management.  \n \n(vi) A national consultant will be included in the consultant package. The gender and development consultant \nwill work with the project implementation unit and partner NGOs to develop a gender action plan. \n \n(vii) A project performance monitoring and evaluation system will be developed and institutionalized to assess \nproject  impacts  on  job  creation  and  graduates\u2019  incomes,  and  other  related  indicators  by  gender  and \nsocioeconomic group. \nHas an output been prepared?
