The  Government  of  India  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the improvement of state highways and major district roads \nin Maharashtra. The project will upgrade and maintain about 450 kilometers (km) of state roads \nforming  part  of  the  core  road  network  (CRN)  in  Maharashtra,  which  will  enhance  transport \naccessibility  and  efficiency, and  improve  the  sustainability  of  the  road  network,  in  line  with the \nstate\u2019s Road Development Plan 2001\u20132021.1 It will involve upgrading of state roads to two-lane \nstandard and performance-based maintenance contracts to maintain the improved road assets \nfor 5 years after construction. It also includes initiatives to build institutional capacity within the \nMaharashtra  Public  Works  Department  (MPWD),  the  project  executing  agency,  focusing  on \nstrengthened sustainability and road safety practices. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nState  context.  The  state  of  Maharashtra  is  located  in  central  and  western  India  and \n3. \nborders  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Chhattisgarh,  Goa,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  and  Madhya \nPradesh. With an area of about 0.3 million square km (9.4% of India\u2019s total), it is India\u2019s third-\nlargest state. It is also India\u2019s second-most populous state, with 122.9 million people,2 which is \nforecast  to  increase  to  125.7  million  by  2031.3  The  major  cities  are  Amravati,  Aurangabad, \nKolhapur, Mumbai, Nagpur, Nasik, Pune, Ratnagiri, Sangli, Solapur, and Thane. \n \n4. \nRoad transport context. Maharashtra\u2019s extensive road network totals about 303,350 km, \nand  includes  national  highways  (12,275  km),  state  highways  (34,450  km),  and  district  roads \n(110,750 km). The state\u2019s economic growth has generated significant passenger and freight traffic \ndemand. There were 31.4 million registered vehicles in Maharashtra in 2018, having increased at \na compound annual growth rate of 9% since 2001.4 The average annual daily traffic on the state \nhighways  is  currently  8,000  equivalent  passenger  car  units  per  day,  and  traffic  volumes  are \nexpected to continue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 5%. The MPWD is the \nmain  institution  responsible  for  development  and  maintenance  of  national  highways,  state \nhighways, major district roads, and bridges in Maharashtra. Other district roads and rural roads \nare managed by the Rural Roads Department.5 \n \n5. \nDevelopment need. The key development challenge for Maharashtra is translating the \nstate\u2019s economic growth into more balanced development throughout the state\u2019s rural areas. The \nHuman Development Index (HDI) and per capita income levels vary greatly across the districts in \nthe  state;  rural  areas  away  from  Mumbai,  Nagpur,  Pune,  and  Thane  are  experiencing  slow \neconomic  growth,  which  is  reflected  by  lower  relative  HDI  and  per  capita  income  values. \n\n \n\n1   Government of Maharashtra, Public Works Department. 2012.

New Delhi. \n\nMumbai. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nEconomic inequality in rural districts has increased.6 Most of Maharashtra\u2019s population resides in \nrural  areas  (54%),  where  the  agriculture  sector  is  the  dominant  source  of  employment  and \nlivelihoods;  62%  of  employed  women  work  in  agricultural  occupations,  compared  with  31%  of \nemployed  men.7  The  agriculture  sector  is  facing  repeated  droughts,  with  the  sector\u2019s  share  of \ngross state value added steadily declining, and was estimated to have grown by just 0.4% in 2019 \n(footnote 4). In contrast, the contributions made by the industrial and service sectors to the state\u2019s \neconomy  are  expanding.  Growth  and  development  outside  of  the  state\u2019s  major  urban  centers \nmust be promoted by connecting agricultural and industrial areas to markets and connecting rural \nareas to second-tier cities and towns. This will provide opportunities for livelihood outside of the \nagriculture sector, particularly for women. \n \n6. \nRoad transport needs and issues. Road transport is critical to accessibility, mobility, and \nconnectivity of rural communities in Maharashtra, particularly for accessing markets, employment \nopportunities, and services beyond the agriculture sector. The core development problem is that \nroads connecting rural areas and urban centers are congested, unsafe, and of poor quality. This \nproblem  is  caused  by  the  inadequate  carrying  capacity  of the  state highway  and major  district \nroad network; deteriorating road assets; and poor planning and implementation for road safety. \nNearly 80% of state highways and major district roads in Maharashtra are either single-lane or \nintermediate-lane standard, while 68% of state highways are in average to very poor condition \nwith a roughness index of 3,000 according to the Indian Road Congress standard, highlighting \nthe need for better road asset maintenance planning.  8  In 2018, Maharashtra reported 35,717 \nroad accidents (7.6% of India\u2019s total), including 13,261 fatalities (8.8% of India\u2019s total), an 8.1% \nincrease in the number of fatalities in comparison to 2017.9 This project will help the government \naddress the need for (i) increased road capacity; (ii) improved road asset management planning; \nand (iii) better road safety, especially for women and other vulnerable groups. \n \n7. \nGovernment\u2019s plans for road transport. The Government of Maharashtra, through the \nMPWD, is implementing a road network development plan, with the objectives of improving state \nroads  connecting  industrial,  tourist,  religious,  and  district  headquarters  to  two-lane  roads; \nconnecting  villages  with  all-weather  roads;  and  expanding  the  overall  length  of  Maharashtra\u2019s \nroad network to 336,994 km (footnote 1). In 2016, the MPWD undertook a review to identify a \nCRN of roughly 18,000 km of state highways and major district roads for development in phases. \nBased on the CRN review, about 450 km of high-priority roads were identified. \n \n8. \nAlignment with strategic objectives. This lending proposal  aligns with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, which emphasizes boosting economic competitiveness \nto create more and better jobs; providing inclusive access to infrastructure networks and services; \naddressing  climate  change  and  increasing  climate  resilience;  and  building  greater  institutional \ncapacities.10  The  project  contributes  to  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  by  (i) \naddressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender \nequality;  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  (iv)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security;  and  (v) \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.

Lessons \nfrom previous road transport projects, such as the Chhattisgarh Road Connectivity Project and \nRajasthan  State  Highway  Investment  Program,  and  sector  assessments  in  India  highlight  the \nneed for (i) a longer-term maintenance planning horizon, (ii) stronger attention to road safety, (iii) \nbetter monitoring of project outcomes and impacts, and (iv) analysis of the needs of the executing \nagency to ensure realistic project implementation timeframes.12 This project\u2019s design is informed \nby these lessons. With support from a project management services (PMS) consultant, the new \nexecuting  agency\u2019s  capacity  for  road  maintenance  planning  and  road  safety  auditing  will  be \nimproved, and a project performance monitoring system will be developed and implemented. The \nPMS consultant will provide capacity support to the MPWD throughout project implementation in \nsocial, gender, and environmental safeguards implementation, as well as financial management. \nADB  has  also  provided  a  series  of  focused  safeguards  and  gender  training  workshops  to  the \nexecuting agency during due diligence.  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  connectivity  between  industrial  areas, \nagricultural areas, administrative headquarters, and economic centers of Maharashtra enhanced \n(footnote  1).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  transport  accessibility,  efficiency, \nsustainability, and safety of the CRN in Maharashtra improved.13 \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  State  highways  and  major  district  roads  of  the  CRN  upgraded  and \nmaintained. The project will (i) upgrade about 25 km of major district roads and 425 km of state \nhighways  with  climate  change  adaptation  features;  (ii)  commence  road  maintenance  using \nperformance-based contracts for 450 km of roads; and (iii) install road safety features friendly to \nthe elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities at appropriate locations. \n \n12. \nOutput 2: Capacity in road safety and maintenance increased. The loan will finance \n(i) development and adoption of a maintenance planning methodology for the project roads and \nother CRN roads; (ii) piloting and establishment of a systematic approach to road safety audits \nfor  200  km  of  state  highways;  (iii)  training  in  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster-resilient \nfeatures applicable to road design for MPWD project staff, including women staff; (iv) training in \nroad  safety  auditing,  for  MWD  project  staff,  including  for  women  staff;  and  (v)  increased  road \nsafety awareness among contractors\u2019 personnel, including women personnel. \n\n \n\n13. \nRoads  selected  for  ADB  assistance.  This  project  aims  to  upgrade  priority  roads  that \nform  part  of  the  CRN\u201411  state  highways  and  2  major  district  roads  to  benefit  7  districts  in \nMaharashtra.  Roads  were  prioritized  systematically  using  criteria  that  include  (i)  population \nserved; (ii) connectivity to national highways, other state highways and interstate roads, sea ports, \nairports,  and  major  rail  hubs;  (iii)  connectivity  to  industrial  areas,  enterprise  clusters,  and \nagricultural areas; (iv) existing traffic volumes; (v) existing road width; (vi) economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR); and (vii) land, environment, and social impacts. The state roads selected will \nimprove  accessibility  and  safety  in  districts  with  relatively  lower  HDI  scores  (Amravati, \nOsmanabad, Washim, Yavatmal), as well as areas with heavy reliance on the agriculture sector \n\n \n\n11 ADB. 2019.

Access  will  also  be  enhanced  to  markets  for \nhorticulture products as well as to new employment opportunities in the tourism and new power \ngeneration  projects.  In  northern  Akola  and  eastern  Amravati,  upgrades  to  the  selected  state \nhighways and major district road will improve connectivity between rural areas and administrative \nheadquarters and the major strategic national highway from Mumbai to Kolkata via Nagpur, as \nwell as to national highways connecting to the adjacent state of Madhya Pradesh. In Yavatmal, \nconnectivity will be enhanced to the national highway connecting Washim to the Mumbai\u2013Kolkata \nstrategic national highway and to the state of Telangana to the south. In Solapur, the upgrades to \ntwo state highways will enhance connectivity between industrial areas and the national highway \nfrom  Solapur  to  Pune,  as  well  as  to  national  highways  connecting  to  Telangana.  Overall,  the \nselected road improvements will enhance employment opportunities and help reduce poverty in \nrural  areas  of  Maharashtra  by  providing  more  efficient  and  safe  connections  to  important \nadministrative headquarters (Amravati, Ratnagiri, and Solapur) and the state\u2019s major economic \ncenters (Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik, and Pune). Additional priority roads forming part of the CRN \nin Maharashtra are planned as a subsequent project for ADB\u2019s assistance.  \n \nC. \n \n15. \nADB has extensive experience in road transport projects across India at the national and \nstate levels. This project is the first proposed ADB financing for the development of state highways \nand  major  district  roads  in  Maharashtra  and  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  assistance  in \nMaharashtra  to  improve  2,100  km  of  rural  roads.14  ADB  is  currently  coordinating  with  the \nGovernment of India, through the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, to strengthen road \nsafety through a state road incentive program. That program excludes infrastructure components \nand focuses on institutional aspects, accident response and monitoring systems, vehicle fitness \nand awareness campaigns. This project\u2019s scope complements the state road incentive program \nthrough  infrastructure  improvements  relating  to  road  safety.  Through  this  project,  road \nmaintenance planning and road safety within the new executing agency will be updated to include \nlatest best practices and formalized through systematic methodologies. All civil works contracts \nencourage  private  sector  involvement  by  including  5-year  performance-based  maintenance \nobligations to improve asset quality and service levels. An overall road maintenance strategy and \nplan will be defined for the project roads once the 5-year performance-based maintenance period \nis over. A tool kit and road safety audit framework will be developed alongside hands-on training \nin road safety auditing. Knowledge-sharing events will benefit officials, contractors, consultants, \nMPWD staff, and other stakeholders.

The climate change impact on the project is assessed \nas medium. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment indicated an increased risk of extreme \ntemperatures and increased rainfall because of climate change.16 High temperatures and heat \n\n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fwaves  impact  road  pavement  integrity,  causing  surface  failures,  including  cracking,  raveling, \npotholes, and ruts. The pavement design has adopted the use of viscosity-graded VG-30 paving \nbitumen in lieu of the earlier grade used in most state roads in India. This heavier duty bitumen \npavement  will  tolerate  significant  traffic  loads  and  distress  induced  by  higher  temperatures. \nExtreme rainfall is projected to increase in all districts of Maharashtra, with the greatest increases \nin  the  northern  areas.  Drainage  will  be  resized  and  improved  to  cope  with  higher  flooding \nfrequency  and  to  provide  higher  discharge  capacities.  Roads  will  also  be  raised  by  about  0.3 \nmeters.  Road  embankments  will  be  raised  in  critical  sections  to  prevent  water  stagnation  and \nflooding  impacts.  Climate  change  adaptation  measures  are  estimated  to  cost  about  $16.79 \nmillion. ADB will finance 76.0% of adaptation costs. \n \nE. \n \n21. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  by  the  MPWD  through  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU) and project implementation unit (PIU) field offices for civil works contract packages. The \nMPWD will also engage consulting firms to be the authority engineers for the works contracts, \nand a PMS consultant to support project implementation. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nApril 2020\u2013December 2024 \n31 December 2024 \n30 June 2025 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Key implementing agency \n\n(iii)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nGovernment of Maharashtra, Public Works Department \nProject management unit in the Public Works Department, \nGovernment of Maharashtra  \nProject implementation unit in the Public Works Department, \nGovernment of Maharashtra, about 45 staffa \nOpen competitive \nbidding (nationally \nadvertised) \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection; \nfull technical \nproposal \n\nThree contracts for \nauthority engineer and \nproject management \nservices \n2,545 person-months \n\nNine contracts \n\n$183.31 million \n\n$9.57 million \n\nRetroactive financing of eligible works and consulting services \nexpenditures, incurred before loan effectiveness but within 12 \nmonths prior to loan signing, up to 20% of the loan amount; advance \ncontracting for recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil \nworks. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote:  The  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  will  commence  during  the  implementation  period  and  extend \nbeyond the estimated loan closing date.

The MPWD prepared and approved the \n22. \nengineering  design  of  the  proposed  project  roads  during  project  preparation.  The  engineering \ndesign  follows  applicable  criteria  in  line  with  Indian  Roads  Congress  regulations  and  also \nincorporates  several  climate  change  adaptation  and  road  safety  aspects.  The  project  team \nconducted an independent review of the engineering design, and all recommended improvements \nhave subsequently been addressed in the design. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe project is economically viable. Economic evaluation of the project was undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines  by  comparing  life  cycle  economic  costs  and  benefits  in  with-\nproject and without-project scenarios, against an assumed hurdle rate of 9% as decision criteria.17 \nThe Highway Development Model 4 (HDM-4) was used to estimate road agency and road user \ncosts based on input data on traffic, road geometry, pavement condition, and improvement and \nmaintenance costs. Project benefits include savings associated with vehicle operating costs and \ntravel times. Additional benefits derived from better safety and quality of maintenance works have \nnot  been  included  in the  quantitative  analysis  and  would  improve the  economic  viability  of the \nproject. The EIRR of the project is estimated at 16.5%, not including the benefits of reduced road \naccidents. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the economic viability of the project \nunder adverse changes in costs and benefits, with an EIRR of 11.3% under the most sensitive \nscenario involving (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a delay of 1 year in opening the project \nroads,  (iii)  a  15%  decrease  in  traffic  demand,  and  (iv)  a  decrease  of  10%  in  time  values  of \npassengers.18 \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe project will not generate revenue. Once the 5-year performance-based maintenance \nperiod  is  over,  the  MPWD  will  assume  responsibility  for  maintenance  through  regular  budget \nallocations in each financial year. Financial sustainability analysis demonstrated that the MPWD\u2019s \nannual budget allocation for maintenance increased from \u20b917.46 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2015 \nto about \u20b918.00 billion in FY2020, although portions of the road network still require maintenance \nand rehabilitation. The project\u2019s recurrent costs will not place an excessive burden on the MPWD \nto  maintain  the  project  roads  in  the  future.  The  total  estimated  cost  of  maintaining  the  project \nroads is \u20b91.09 billion in constant prices over the 20-year asset life. The annual recurrent cost for \nroutine maintenance is estimated at \u20b954.17 million in constant prices, while periodic maintenance \nwill only be required in 2034 at an estimated cost of \u20b97.41 million in constant prices. The project\u2019s \nestimated  annual  recurrent  costs  are  estimated  at  about  0.3%  of  the  MPWD\u2019s  overall \nmaintenance budget allocation for FY2020. \n \n25. \nThe  MPWD  has  committed  to  prioritizing  the  allocation  of  maintenance  funding  for  the \nproject roads. However, road maintenance funding must be sustainable, and therefore the project \nsustainability risk is high. Capacity development under output 2 of this project (para. 12) will assist \nthe MPWD in developing a methodology to help sustain road assets at desirable levels; improve \npolicies and procedures; and increase project sustainability. \n\nSustainability \n\n17 Asian Development Bank. 2017.

The  MPWD  will  implement  the  project  through  a  PMU  dedicated  to  ADB \nprojects,  situated  in  the  state  capital  Mumbai.  Because  the  project  covers  a  large  geographic \narea,  four field  offices  have  been  established  under  a  PIU to  support the  PMU  operation.  The \nPMU and the field offices have sufficient staff capacity to prepare and implement the project. The \nPMS consultant will support the PMU in the areas of asset management, road safety, reporting, \nfinancial management, and safeguard monitoring. \n \n27. \nFinancial  management.  The  assessed  premitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate,  mainly  because  the  MPWD  and  the  PMU  have  not  previously  implemented  ADB-\nsupported projects and the PMU lacks an internal audit function. The risk will be mitigated through \nappropriate measures, such as engagement of a chartered accounting firm to perform internal \naudit of the project on a semiannual basis, and recruitment of specialist staff to prepare a financial \nmanagement manual and to provide training. \n \n28. \nProcurement  of  civil  works.  The  procurement  risk  level  is  medium.  The  assessment \nconcluded that the executing agency has significant experience in contract management and the \nprocurement  of  civil  works  and  consultant  recruitment  under  national  and  Government  of \nMaharashtra  procurement  regulations.  However,  the  executing  agency  is  new  to  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policies and regulations. Capacity-building sessions for procurement have already \nbeen  provided.  Under  advance  contracting,  the  procurement  of  nine  civil  works  packages  and \nrecruitment of consulting services are at advanced stages. The procurement of civil works and \nconsulting services financed by the ADB loan is in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time), and all procurement has been conducted under prior review. The \ne-procurement  system  was  assessed  by  ADB  as  part  of  due  diligence  and  found  to  be \nsatisfactory. Value for money has been optimized using multiple contract bidding to ensure least-\ncost combinations for civil works packages and 5-year performance-based maintenance contracts \nto ensure quality of work. The procurement strategy considered location in packaging both civil \nworks and consulting services packages. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MPWD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nE. \n \n30. \nPoverty. The average poverty level in Maharashtra is lower than the national rate as a \nresult of relatively higher average income levels in the four main urban centers: Mumbai, Nagpur, \nPune, and Thane. However, there is wide income disparity within Maharashtra, which the project \nwill  help  address  by  improving  connectivity,  facilitating  access  to  services,  and  accelerating \neconomic growth. The project will improve state highways and major district roads in rural areas; \nbeneficiaries, including the poor, will benefit from improved access to basic services and living \nenvironments. The project will also improve livelihoods and trade opportunities for the nonurban \npopulation. The project preparatory phase involved consultations with local communities\u2014both \nwomen and men\u2014living along the proposed project roads. Community members were supportive \nof the project and expressed that the improved roads will enhance mobility between commercial \ncenters, which would increase economic and employment opportunities. Local communities also \nexpressed their belief that improved connectivity would contribute to reducing poverty. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n31. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  There  are  several \ngender-related advantages to improved road infrastructure, including improved access to health \nand  education  services,  increased  income  opportunities,  affordable  and  reliable  transportation \nfacilities promoting safe mobility, better implementation of government outreach programs, and \nreduced time poverty. A gender action plan has been prepared detailing activities with indicators \nand  targets,  responsible  agencies,  and  timeframes  to  ensure  effective  implementation, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  of  gender  action  plan  activities.  The  gender  action  plan  outlines \nactivities  to  (i)  enhance  women\u2019s  economic  and  human  development  opportunities;  (ii)  build \ninstitutional gender capacities through gender training for staff, consultants, and contractors; (iii) \nstrengthen the technical and management capacities of women staff in climate adaptation and \nresilience  features  applicable  to  road  design  and  road  safety  auditing;  (iv)  create  space  for \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  decision-making  and  leadership;  (v)  reduce  time  poverty;  and  (vi) \npromote gender-responsive infrastructure by ensuring that road and bus shelter design includes \nfeatures responsive to the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the differently abled. This \ncomponent  will  include  a  pilot  initiative  of  additional  design  features,  such  as  solar  lights  and \ninformation  on  women-specific  schemes,  empowerment  messages  for  women,  and  helpline \nnumbers in select bus shelters. \n \n32. \nLabor.  The  bidding  documents  for  the  civil  works  contractors  include  provisions  to  (i) \nensure that all applicable labor laws are complied with, including the prohibition against employing \nchildren  in  construction;  (ii)  encourage  employment  of  the  poor  and  inhabitants  of  affected \ncommunities; and (iii) ensure that wages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. \n \nF. \n \n33. \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n34. \nEnvironment (category  B).  All road  works  will  follow  existing  alignments,  except for  a \nfew improvements in road geometry in some portions. No significant, irreversible environmental \nimpacts  are  anticipated.  Two  roads\u2014State  Highway  204  (Barshi\u2013Solapur)  and  State  Highway \n68A (Korti\u2013Awati portion)\u2014pass through portions of the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary.20 The \nbiodiversity assessment established that the sanctuary is not a critical habitat for, nor will the road \nimprovement  impact, the  endangered  birds.21  Mitigation  measures  were  proposed  in  the  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) for the observed movement of wildlife, such as black bucks and \nother small mammals along these roads. No other roads pass through or are near any protected \nor  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  The  MPWD  prepared  an  IEE  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), which is on the ADB website. The MPWD will not allow road \nconstruction to commence without obtaining the necessary permits and clearances. Anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts from the  project  entail  typical  road  construction-related  issues,  such  as \nacquisition of forest land; removal of trees; generation of dust, noise, exhaust, and waste from \nconstruction  and  worker  camps;  water  contamination;  occupational  health  and  safety  issues; \nslope failures; erosion; and siltation. There will be minimal noise and air pollution as a result of \nincreased  traffic  volumes,  and  levels  will  not  exceed  the  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  and \nInternational Finance Corporation standards, except in some built-up locations where the baseline \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n20 The Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary (formerly Jawaharlal Nehru Bustard Sanctuary) is identified as an Important \nBird and Biodiversity Area by BirdLife International, although noted as unsuitable habitat for the Great Indian Bustard. \n21 As assessed based on the International Finance Corporation\u2019s Guidance Note 6 on Biodiversity Conservation and \nSustainable Management of Living Natural Resources updated in 2019, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\falready  exceeds  the  Indian  noise  standard.  The  improvement  works  in  these  locations  are \nanticipated to reduce noise by improving road surface conditions and reducing traffic congestion. \nVibration  during  construction  and  implementation  is  also  unlikely  to  negatively  affect  sensitive \nreceptors  along  the  road.  Mitigation  measures  to  address  environmental  impacts  have  been \nincluded  in  the  road-specific  environmental  management  plans,  which  are  part  of  the  bid \ndocuments. The MPWD conducted meaningful consultations with the affected persons and other \nkey stakeholders (e.g., forestry officials) while preparing the IEE. Concerns of affected persons \nand  stakeholders  have  been  considered  and  will  continue  to  be  addressed  during  project \nimplementation through the grievance redress mechanism. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  will  entail  only  limited  involuntary \nresettlement because of minor land acquisition and some encroachment in built-up areas. Works \nwill  be  restricted  to  rights-of-way  already  owned  by  the  executing  agency,  except  in  Pusad, \nYavatmal  district,  where  216  square  meters  of  barren  land  will  be  required  for  geometric \nimprovements to the road design. The MPWD will acquire the land owned by one person by direct \npurchase  based  on  the  provisions  of  national  law,  state  policy,  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  Should  negotiations fail,  land  and  assets  will  be  acquired  using  eminent  domain  in \naccordance  with  the  same  law  and  policies.  The  MPWD  has  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  for \neach of the nine project roads based on full census surveys using detailed design specifications. \nThe  resettlement  plans  adequately  assess  the  scope  of  involuntary  resettlement,  and  the \nproposed mitigation measures are commensurate with the known risks and impacts. According \nto  the  surveys,  380  households  (1,772  persons)  will  experience  impacts  on  land,  structures, \nand/or livelihoods. This includes one titled landowner and 379 nontitled households, which mostly \nown  kiosks  that  will  be  shifted  back,  but  remain  in  situ.  The  most  sensitive  subproject  is  in \nYavatmal District, where 40 nontitled households (190 persons) will experience loss of greater \nthan 10% of productive assets.22 Compensation rates at replacement cost, shifting assistance, \nincome-restoration assistance, and support for vulnerable groups are provided in the resettlement \nplans. The MPWD conducted meaningful consultations with displaced persons. The resettlement \nplans are disclosed in village council offices and the ADB website. Grievance redress committees \nat each field office will address affected persons\u2019 concerns. An implementation nongovernment \norganization will be engaged to support the MPWD. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  social  impact  assessments  undertaken  to \n36. \nprepare  the  project  roads  for  rehabilitation  suggest  that  no  indigenous  peoples\u2019  communities \nwithin the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement will be affected by the project. \n \nSafeguards  implementation.  The  PMU  includes  nodal  officers  for  environmental  and \n37. \nsocial  safeguards.  The  PMU  nodal  officers  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  management  of \nsafeguards under the project, supported by PIU officers, who will serve as the safeguards focal \npoints at the site level. The PMS consultant will provide project implementation support, including \nsafeguards implementation to the PMU. Two authority engineers will supervise and manage the \nconstruction  works,  including  safeguards  implementation.  The  civil  works  contractors  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the environmental management plan and will include environment, \nhealth, and safety officers in their team. The MPWD will organize an initial coordination or training \nworkshop to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party for complying with environmental \nand  social  safeguard  requirements.  Hands-on  training  will  be  conducted  by  the  authority \n\n \n\n22 The subproject will improve the Shrirampur\u2013Vaijapur\u2013Risod\u2013Washim\u2013Pusad\u2013Mahagaon\u2013Fulsawangi\u2013Mandvi Road \n(SH51)  under  Package  EPC5.  The  census  indicates  that  19  kiosks  and  11  residential  structures  owned  by  33 \nhouseholds will be fully affected. The affected persons will not be required to relocate because all structures will be \nreconstructed in situ. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nengineers or ADB as necessary during project implementation. \n \nG. \n \n38. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nCivil works contracts include 5-year performance-based maintenance under the \nresponsibility of the contractors.
