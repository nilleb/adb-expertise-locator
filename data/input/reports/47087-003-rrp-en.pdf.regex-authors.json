THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Greater Mekong Subregion Highway Modernization \nProject. \n \n2.  The project will improve transport conditions on Myanmar\u2019s East\u2013West Economic Corridor \n(EWEC) and North\u2013South Economic Corridor (NSEC) by (i) improving about 99 kilometers (km) \nof Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) highways, (ii) improving the safety of the Yangon\u2013Mandalay \nexpressway, and (iii) preparing detailed designs for other highway projects on the GMS corridors. \nThe project expands efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development \npartners to upgrade the country\u2019s national highway network along the GMS corridors. It will \npromote inclusive economic growth in Myanmar and regional cooperation and integration. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic context. Myanmar remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, with \nan estimated per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $1,264 (2017). To increase economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty, Myanmar\u2019s transport system needs to be modernized. In particular, \nthe GMS road corridors are the backbone of Myanmar\u2019s transport system. However, the quality \nof the infrastructure along the GMS corridors is weak and lacks connectivity\u2014fourteen million \npeople do not have basic road access in Myanmar. Improving the capacity, safety, and condition \nof the GMS corridors will reduce national transport costs, facilitate access to Myanmar\u2019s remote \nethnic minority areas, and improve regional connectivity, lifting many out of poverty. \n \n4.  The NSEC, which links Yangon with Mandalay and the People\u2019s Republic of China, is the \nessential trading route of the country. The EWEC connects Thailand with Yangon and its Thilawa \nSpecial Economic Zone and then onward to Pathein, the capital of the Ayeyarwaddy Region, \nwhich is one of the poorest regions in Myanmar and most vulnerable to disasters and the impacts \nof climate change. The improvement of the EWEC will also facilitate access to Mon and Kayin \nstates, which will spur economic activity and demonstrate the government\u2019s commitment to \nimproving the well-being of people in areas that have long been affected by conflict.1 To spread \nthe benefits of trunk highway improvements to local communities, ADB has been helping the \ngovernment set up a national rural road strategy,2 and is preparing the proposed Rural Roads \nand Access Project, planned for 2019 approval. ADB estimates that GDP per capita could reach \n$3,500 by 2030, if the Government of Myanmar implements necessary market policies and large \ninfrastructure investments, particularly those aimed at improving Myanmar\u2019s highway network.3 \n \n5.  Need to modernize highway network. Demand for road transport has increased quickly \nsince 2012, when the government eased vehicle import restrictions. During 2012\u20132016, the \nnumber of cars registered in Myanmar increased by 80%, the number of motorcycles increased \nby 145%, and the number of trucks increased by 280%. The sudden increase in road traffic has \nworsened pavement conditions, caused congestion (particularly around Yangon and on the main \n                                                \n1  ADB follows a conflict and context-sensitive approach in designing all its projects in Myanmar. Paragraph 29 outlines \nhow this project handles conflict sensitivity. \n2  Government of Myanmar. 2018. National Rural Roads and Access Strategy. Naypyitaw. \n3  ADB. 2014. Myanmar: Unlocking the Potential\u2014Country Diagnostic Study. Manila. \n \n ", "2 \ninternational corridors), and increased road crashes and fatalities. There were about 5,000 road-\nrelated fatalities in 2016, up from 2,173 in 2009.4 \n \n6.  However, the condition of Myanmar\u2019s basic transport infrastructure is poor due to years of \ninadequate investment and lack of access to modern technology. Only 53% of the 40,000 km \ntrunk road network managed by the Department of Highways (DOH) was paved as of 2015. \nPavement works were done using outdated, labor-intensive methods. Insufficient design and \nquality control have produced rough surfaces that are vulnerable to intense rain events and need \nfrequent maintenance. The main roads are vulnerable to climate events (e.g., typhoons, storm \nsurges, and floods), which are expected to become more frequent and intense in the future. \n \n7.  Highway improvement priorities. With ADB support, the Ministry of Construction (MOC) \ncompleted  condition  surveys  (2015)  on  27,000  km  of  national  roads,  designed  an  asset \nmanagement strategy, and identified about 5,000 km of priority roads. The MOC developed a \nroad  masterplan5  in  2016,  which  prioritized  the  project  highways  for  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement based on strategic alignment with government priorities and the GMS corridors, as \nwell as the economic viability of the proposed works.  \n \n8.  Expressway  safety  program.  ADB  completed  in  2016  a  strategic  review,  which \nrecommended that the government develop a road safety investment program, improve the safety \nof the Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway, and consider opening it to truck traffic to reduce logistics \ncosts (footnote 4). Road crashes on this expressway killed 280 people during 2014\u20132015, and \ntrucks are banned from using it because the government believes it would be too hazardous. In \n2016,  the  MOC  created  a  road  safety  unit  and  began  safety  improvement  works  on  the \nexpressway. With ADB\u2019s assistance, it developed an expressway safety improvement program \nfor which it requested ADB financing. \n \n9.  Grade-separated  highway  development.  To  address  long-term  highway  capacity \nneeds, the MOC\u2019s 2016 master plan also considered the development of a grade-separated \nexpressway network (footnote 5). Eventually, new road alignments will be needed to improve the \nEWEC, particularly on the Bago\u2013Kyaikto section. Upgrading the current alignment is not the \npreferred solution because it is too long and winding. Myanmar has limited experience with \nmodern engineering design for grade-separated highways and requires international assistance \nto develop the new highway project. The project will be prepared in partnership with Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. ADB is preparing the project feasibility study under a technical \nassistance project.6 Once the feasibility study is completed, the project will finance the preparation \nof the detailed design. Financing for the construction of the new highway will be processed \nseparately through the proposed Second Greater Mekong Subregion Highway Modernization \nProject, formerly the GMS EWEC Highway Development Project, planned for 2020 approval. In \nparallel, Japan International Cooperation Agency is considering financing the construction of a \nbridge on the Sittaung River, which is part of the new alignment. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. Since 2012, transport has been a pillar of ADB\u2019s \nreengagement  strategy  in  Myanmar.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  improving  access  and \nconnectivity to connect rural and urban areas and markets, and to link Myanmar with the regional \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2016.

ADB initially financed road improvement projects in the Ayeyarwaddy \nRegion and along the EWEC.7 The two projects, ongoing as of 2018, have strengthened the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity to implement gradually larger and more complex projects. ADB also \nprepared a strategic review of the sector in 2016 (footnote 4). On this basis, the government \nrequested  that  ADB  prepare  strategies  for  modernizing  important  subsectors  (trunk  roads, \nrailways, rural roads, and urban transport) and finance demonstration projects that improve vital \ninfrastructure and support reforms.8  \n \n11.  The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for \nMyanmar9 and aligns with Strategy 2030 (Table 1).10 It was designed with ADB assistance to \naddress trunk road improvement and safety needs on key sections of the GMS corridors,11 in line \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u20132021.12 The project builds on ADB\u2019s \nexperience  with  road  projects  in  Myanmar,  particularly  in  design  standards,  specifications, \ncontracting approaches, and resettlement issues. The subsequent Rural Roads and Access \nProject will link poor communities in Ayeyarwaddy and Magway to the project\u2019s and connecting \ntrunk roads.  \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Greater Mekong Subregion Highway Modernization Project \n1.

The project is aligned with the following impact: all-weather and safe road transport \ninfrastructure developed.13 The project will have the following outcome: efficiency and safety of \nroad traffic along the GMS EWEC and NSEC in Myanmar improved.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Greater Mekong Subregion highways improved. The project will upgrade at \nleast 99 km of highway along GMS corridors, primarily the Bago\u2013Thanlyin highway section of the \nEWEC, under this output. The road works will provide a pavement width and an asphalt concrete \npavement designed to meet future traffic growth. Bridges that are in poor condition or below \nstandard will be replaced. Some highway sections are vulnerable to flooding and quick pavement \ndeterioration after extreme rain events. To address climate risks, several adaptation measures\u2014\nincreased embankment height, improved pavement surfacing, improved bridges and drains\u2014are \nincluded in the project design. \n \n14.  Output 2: Safety of Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway improved. The project will improve \nthe safety of the Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway. The 65 km section from Hlegu in Yangon to \nBawnetgyi near Bago, which is common to the EWEC and the NSEC, will be improved to enable \nfuture use by trucks. Following the improvements, a community-based road safety program will \nbe carried out to improve the behavior of road users. On the rest of the expressway (about 530 \nkm), the project will mitigate the most serious safety risks attributable to engineering by providing \nsignage and line marking and installing safety barriers at some critical bridge approaches. The \nproject will identify areas prone to frequent crashes and, when feasible, make them safer. \n \n15.  Output 3: Detailed design for other highway projects prepared. The project will \nfinance  consulting  services  to  carry  out  detailed  engineering  design,  safeguard  planning, \nprocurement support, and other studies needed to prepare technically and economically viable \nhighway projects. This will include preparation for the improvement of the Yangon\u2013Pathein \nhighway (165 km) and the development of a new highway alignment from Bago to Kyaikto (about \n70 km). ADB has advised the borrower that approval of the financing for the detailed design does \nnot commit ADB to finance a subsequent project. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $202.1 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).15 \nTo finance the program, the government has requested a concessional loan of $194.7 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n                                                \n13 Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Transport and Communications. 2015.

The underlying \ntraffic projection is based on present traffic volumes, with growth rates that consider the likely \nrapid increase in traffic that will occur as Myanmar\u2019s economy continues to develop. \n \n21.  The Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway safety improvement output of the project will reduce \nroad safety risks and enable a pilot section to be used by trucks. The works involve paving the \ninner and outer shoulders of the expressway and overlaying the existing rough cement concrete \npavement with asphalt concrete. The expressway\u2019s median will be reshaped, and a rope barrier \nwill  be  added.  Surveys  carried  out  during  project  preparation  confirmed  that  the  current \nexpressway\u2019s concrete pavement had sufficient strength to be used by trucks, except for a few \nweak slabs that will be replaced under the project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic viability. The project is economically viable. The main benefits of the highway \nimprovement works under output 1 are reduced vehicle operating costs and shorter travel times. \nCompared with the without-project situation, highway widening will limit congestion, thereby \nreducing travel time. The expressway improvement and safety works will reduce logistics costs \nand decrease the frequency and social cost of road crashes. The overall economic internal rate \nof return of the project is 13.1%.  \n ", "7 \n \n23.  Financial viability. The sustainability of the project highways depends on general budget \nappropriations  for  road  maintenance.  In  2016,  the  Government  of  Myanmar  and  state \ngovernments allocated about $250 million for trunk road maintenance through the DOH. This level \nis considered adequate given the size of the network. Moreover, to ensure long-term budget \nadequacy, the government plans to set up a road user tax on fuel and earmark this revenue for \nsupporting road investments and maintenance, possibly through a road fund. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Institutional capacity. The DOH has gained experience in implementing two ADB-\nfinanced projects (footnote 7). The PMU is headed by a project director with the rank of chief \nengineer. In parallel to the project, ADB will strengthen the PMU\u2019s capacity in safeguards and \nfinancial management through technical assistance. \n \n25.  Financial management. The pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial \nmainly because of weaknesses in government-wide financial management systems. The DOH \nwill set up a PMU to manage day-to-day activities, including project-specific financial management \ntasks to mitigate the risks. As the DOH is already implementing two other ADB-financed projects, \nit has knowledge and experience regarding ADB policies and procedures (para. 10). ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  Poverty. The main beneficiaries of the project will be residents of rural areas of Bago and \nYangon regions, users of the Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway, and passengers and shippers using \nthe GMS EWEC. The rural areas of Bago and Yangon regions are among the poorest areas in \nMyanmar  and  roads  there  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  impacts  (e.g.,  floods  and \ntyphoons). In 2014, 35% of residents of the Yangon Region and 25% of residents of the Bago \nRegion lived in poverty.16 Poverty in rural areas, where township-specific data do not exist, is \nhigher. The Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway has had a poor safety record since its opening in \n2011. This poor safety record has led the government to ban trucks from using the expressway. \nTrucks use the old Yangon\u2013Mandalay parallel highway instead, which is congested and unsafe \nas it passes through many communities. There were 605 road-related fatalities on the old highway \nin 2015. The project will improve the safety of road users and pedestrians and provide stronger \nlinks between the rural and poor regions and the more developed urban hub of Yangon. \n \n27.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  some  gender  elements.  Gender-friendly  elements \ninclude (i) undertaking gender-sensitive community-based programs on road safety, HIV/AIDS, \nand human trafficking; (ii) ensuring that at least 50% of community facilitators in such programs \nare women; and (iii) ensuring that at least 50% of government staff that will be trained under the \nproject will be women. \n \n28.  HIV/AIDS and trafficking. The project will improve existing corridors and is thus not \nexpected to significantly increase the incidence of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and \nhuman trafficking. However, the increased presence of road workers during construction and \n                                                \n16 World Bank. 2014. Myanmar\u2014Ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a time of transition: A Systematic \nCountry Diagnostic. Washington, DC. \n ", "8 \nincreased traffic may elevate the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. Disruption to livelihoods caused \nby the displacement of several shops along the project alignment may increase human trafficking \nrisks as well. To mitigate these risks, the contractors will put in place prevention and assistance \nprograms for their workers, and the project management and contract supervision consultant will \noversee a community awareness program.17 \n \n29.  Conflict sensitivity. The project does not finance anything directly in any of the conflict-\naffected areas in Myanmar. Within the Bago and Yangon regions, which have not faced any \nconflicts, the project will benefit all ethnic groups in a fair, unbiased and equal manner. ADB\u2019s \nongoing GMS EWEC Eindu to Kawkareik Road Improvement Project (Footnote 7) supports \ndirectly the upgrading of a 66-km section of the GMS EWEC in Kayin state, which has faced \nsignificant conflicts. While the proposed project does not have any components in Kayin state, it \nwill contribute in important ways to conflict resolution in the state. The upgraded Bago\u2013Thanlyin \nhighway section under the project, and the new Bago\u2013Kyaikto highway which will be designed \nunder the project and considered for financing under the proposed Second GMS Highway \nModernization Project (planned 2020 approval), will become important conduits for greater \nmobility of people between Kayin, the rest of Myanmar, and regionally. The sequence of projects \nwill ultimately halve the travel times from Kayin state to Yangon and the associated logistics costs. \nThe people of Kayin state could benefit from higher education and specialized health care choices \navailable in the more developed regions of Myanmar. Further, by connecting the EWEC segments \nthat are being upgraded in Kayin state with the rest of country and regionally, there will be greater \ntrade opportunities for Kayin state, which in turn could foster growth, reduce poverty and facilitate \nconflict resolution. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.18 \n \n31.  Environment (category B). The project is not expected to cause significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts. The MOC has prepared an initial environmental examination report \nfollowing the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Myanmar\u2019s environmental \nimpact assessment procedure. Public consultation was undertaken, and a grievance redress \nmechanism  has  been  designed  to  address  issues  and  complaints  that  may  arise  during \nconstruction. The main potential adverse environmental impacts are on (i) air quality, water \nquality, and receptors sensitive to noise and dust; (ii) land use and soils; (iii) roadside trees; and \n(iv) worker and community health and safety. The cutting and removal of roadside trees to allow \nfor road widening works and to promote road safety are expected to be a concern for communities \nand local governments. Impacts will be offset through replacement planting and tree aftercare \nprograms developed by the MOC in consultation with Myanmar\u2019s Forest Department. \n \n32.  The MOC has prepared detailed environmental management plans which meet the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and have been incorporated into the project\u2019s \ncivil works contract documentation. Before construction starts, each contractor will prepare a \ncontractor  environmental  management  plan  that  will  include  all  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring requirements. The PMU, with support from the project management \n                                                \n17 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. In compliance with ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements on information disclosure and consultation, the Ministry of Construction \nposted the safeguard plans on ADB\u2019s website in September 2017. \n ", "9 \nand contract supervision consultant, will supervise the implementation of each contractor\u2019s \nenvironmental management plan. The environmental quality monitoring program will monitor the \nimpact of noise and air pollution and assess changes in water quality during construction. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The highway improvement works will require \nland clearance of the corridor of impact, which is fully within the existing rights-of-way. This will \naffect  552  households  and  2,057  persons.  The  inventory  of  losses  survey  estimated  that \n182 households will experience total loss of residential structures and be required to relocate, and \nthat 161 shops will be permanently displaced. While many people who will lose residential \nstructures have alternative houses and/or land, at least 67 households are expected to need long-\nterm resettlement assistance. No land acquisition is expected, as all works will be within the \nexisting rights-of-way owned by the government. The MOC held consultations with the affected \npeople during the preparation of the resettlement plan, which aims to mitigate all involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  by  providing  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and  assistance  for \nresettlement and livelihood restoration to enable  the affected people to restore their living \nstandards. The expressway safety improvement works are not expected to have any involuntary \nresettlement impacts. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to have impacts on \nindigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.

ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents (footnote 15). The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nV.
