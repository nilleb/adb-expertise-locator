Public investment on infrastructure has declined over the last decade \nwith the government investing just over 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) annually (totaling \nan  estimated  $5.7  billion  in  2015)  towards  infrastructure,1 well  below  the  estimated  required \nannual  investment  of  7.6%  of  GDP  (equal  to  $20.6  billion  in  2015). 2  This  has  resulted  in \ninefficiencies across key infrastructure sectors\u2014such as delays in transport of goods and limited \naccess to energy and potable water\u2014which affect both public welfare, and the country\u2019s overall \nindustrial and economic growth. \n \nPunjab\u2019s  population  of  110  million  accounts  for  about  53%  of  that  of  Pakistan;  the \n4. \npopulation density of 536 persons per square kilometer is double that of Pakistan as a whole.3 \nPunjab accounts for 60% of national GDP, underscoring its pivotal role for economic growth and \nemployment.4 Punjab is also undergoing significant urbanization, with a compounded annual urban \npopulation growth rate of 3.5% (2007\u20132015), which is four times the rural population growth rate. \nThe  urban  population  reached  42.9  million  in  FY2015.  Cities  are  facing  challenges  due  to  the \nsignificant  rural\u2013urban  migration,  which  is  increasing  demand  for  public  infrastructure.  Growing \ninfrastructure investments require broader funding sources from the government, investors and \ncommercial banks, which in the past have shown limited appetite for providing long-dated limited \nrecourse debt to infrastructure projects. \n \n5. \nTo  meet  these  challenges  the  GOPb  increased  its  Annual  Development  Programme \n(ADP) by 15% to an estimated PRs635 billion ($6.0 billion) for FY2018, from PRs550 billion ($5.2 \nbillion)  for  FY2017.5 Infrastructure  development  absorbs  36%  of  the  ADP,  and  is  expected  to \nincrease by 13%, to PRs230 billion ($2.2 billion) in FY2018.6 Social services represent 23% of \nthe  ADP,  and  will  increase  by  16%  to  PRs144  billion  ($1.4  billion)  in  FY2018.  However,  the \n\n                                                \n1  Based on World Bank. Data: Gross Domestic Product estimate for Pakistan of $271 billion for 2015. \n2  The  estimated  infrastructure  investment  need  is  based  on  the  need  for  the  South  Asia  region,  which  includes \n\nPakistan.

Data: Population Profile Punjab. \n4  Punjab Board of Investment and Trade. Punjab at a Glance. \n5  Government of Punjab. 2016. Development Programme 2016\u20132017. Lahore. \n6  Allocation for water supply and sanitation has been included in this estimate. \n \n\n\favailable budget for public investment in infrastructure is largely insufficient to meet the growing \ndemand. Punjab\u2019s infrastructure investment requirement is estimated at about $3.6 billion\u2013$5.0 \nbillion, which significantly exceeds current public capital spending on infrastructure. To address \nthe budget constraints on infrastructure provision, the Punjab government introduced the Punjab \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership for Infrastructure Act (in 2010 and updated in 2014) to augment private \nsector participation in infrastructure through PPPs.7 \n \n6. \nIn  conjunction  with  the  PPP  for  Infrastructure  Act  in  2010,  the  Punjab  government \nestablished an institutional framework and guidelines to facilitate the preparation, approval, and \nimplementation  of  PPPs. 8  A  PPP  Cell  (PPPC)  was  established  within  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment Department (PDD) to review project proposals (covering technical, operational, and \nlegal compliance to the PPP guidelines), coordinate efforts of line departments, and facilitate the \napproval of PPP projects by the steering committee.9 A Risk Management Unit (RMU) within the \nFinance  Department  also  reviews  project  proposals,  focusing  on  potential  fiscal  risks  and \ncontingent liabilities emanating from PPP projects. The PPPC serves as the PPP Secretariat for \nthe  Punjab  government,  and  submits  reviews  and  recommendations  (from  the  PPPC  and  the \nRMU) to the steering committee for approval. Once approved, the line department is responsible \nfor tendering the project, negotiating agreements, and managing project implementation over the \nterm of the concession agreement. \n \nThe PPPC has a growing project pipeline and about 40 staff members with varying levels \n7. \nof experience and skills that include transaction advisory, projects, policy, communication, and \nproject monitoring. The RMU has one dedicated staff member with some PPP experience, but its \ncapacity to undertake a comprehensive review of financial proposals and concession agreements \nis insufficient, and capacity building is thus needed. Steering committee members have limited \nproject finance and PPP experience, and are thus likely to rely on the recommendations of the \nPPPC and RMU. This highlights the need for a more focused subcommittee to review feedback \nfrom the PPPC and RMU. The varying levels of skills involved in the Punjab government\u2019s PPP \nframework may result in less-than-optimal structuring of PPPs, and approval of PPPs that offer \nlimited value-for-money (VFM). These projects may potentially expose the Punjab government to \nunwanted risks over the term of the concession. \n \nThe  Punjab  government  has  a  strong  pipeline  of  over  40  projects  at  various  stages  of \n8. \ndevelopment.10 Six PPP projects have been awarded since 2010,11 and two are now operational. \nNevertheless, additional resources are required to improve the Punjab government\u2019s capacity and \ndeliver more PPP projects that are fiscally sustainable and offer VFM. In some cases, projects \nreceive upfront government support through a viability gap fund (VGF) in addition to operational \nsupport  in  the  form  of  minimum  revenue  shortfall  guarantees.12 For  example,  the  70-kilometer \nLahore Ring Road Southern Loop Project, a toll road with a 25-year concession costing PRs25 \nbillion ($238 million) awarded in 2016, included (i) upfront VGF support of PRs4.25 billion ($40 \nmillion) for land acquisition (for land access not provisioned at no cost by the government under \n\n                                                \n7  Punjab Public Private Partnership Act 2014. \n8  Government of Punjab, Planning and Development Department.

Government of Punjab. Planning \n\nand Development Department. Awarded Projects. \n\n12 The VGF is currently an allocated annual budget item under the GOPb\u2019s ADP. The VGF budget is managed by the \nPlanning & Development Department, and monitored by the RMU in the Finance Department. Use of the VGF is \napproved by the PPP steering committee. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe project),13 (ii) free provision of land worth PRs4 billion ($38 million) to secure part of the project \nbank borrowing, and (iii) a guarantee to the concessionaire of 50% of the toll revenue shortfall \nshould actual toll revenue fall below 80% of the estimated toll revenue. Other projects that have \nnot tapped the VGF account for provincial government support have still received public support \n(provided  by  line  departments  in  other  forms,  such  as  land  allocation).  Moreover,  there  is  no \nmechanism for (i) monitoring the contingent liabilities of the government resulting from the PPP \nprojects, and (ii) reflecting these in provincial financial statements. \n \nThe Punjab government retained a significant portion of project risk under the Lahore Ring \n9. \nRoad Project, which may limit its ability to derive VFM in the long term.14 Ideally, PPP projects \nshould be structured to provide a reasonable balance between the private investor\u2019s interests and \nfiscal prudence. The Lahore Ring Road Project example underscores the lack of appropriate risk-\nsharing  between  the  private  concessionaire  and  the  government,  which  constrains  adequate \nleverage  of  scarce  public  funds.  While  a  few  GOPb  line  departments  have  developed  some \nexperience  with  PPP  projects,  large  skill  gaps  exist  within  line  departments  that  need  to  be \naddressed  to  enhance  the  flow  of  benefits  to  the  taxpayers,  with  transactions  rigorously \nscrutinized through due diligence and a VFM test. \n \n10. \nTo address this issue, the GOPb provides financial assistance to line agencies\u2014through \nthe  project  development  facility  (PDF)\u2014to  engage  transaction  advisors.15 Because  capacity  of \nthe  line  departments  is  limited,  the  PPPC  facilitates  discussions  with  the  transaction  advisors, \naiming to strike a balanced risk-transfer arrangement that limits government contingent liabilities \nand ensures VFM. \n \nThe  annual  VGF  budget  cannot  be  rolled  over  to  the  following  financial  year,  because \n11. \nthere is no dedicated non-lapsable VGF reserved fund account. Also, the GOPb imposes no limits \non the value of VGF resources per project, which are at times limited only by the total VGF budget \nfor that financial year. Imposing a limit would ensure greater leverage of VGF resources. The VGF \nis a powerful tool for leveraging PPPs by (i) providing upfront capital relief to fund project costs to \nensure commercial viability, (ii) lowering the cost of capital by providing concessional funding or \ncapital  subsidies  that  do  not  require  future  dividends  or  budget  payments,  and  (iii)  supporting \noperational expenses by providing operational subsidies and/or guaranteeing minimum revenues \nover the course of the concession. \n \n12. \nThe institutional capacity in Punjab for PPPs needs to be enhanced through (i) improved \nstructuring  of  eligible  PPP  projects  that  offer  VFM  through  a  more  equitable  risk-sharing \narrangement,  (ii)  a  sound  policy  that  guides  the  use  of  VGF  resources,  and  (iii)  strong  risk \nmanagement policies and systems that identify and mitigate potential project and fiscal-related \nrisks emanating from PPP-supported projects. \n \nThe project is aligned with the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,16 in which PPPs \n13. \nare a key driver of change, and the ADB country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan.17 \nLessons from a similar project in Sindh have been considered in the design of this project.18 Unlike \nthe Sindh project, this project does not propose to establish a separate corporate entity (i.e., a \nVGF  company)\u2014instead,  the  project  will  seek  to  foster  governance  and  accountability  in \n                                                \n13 Land acquisition costs are not capitalized and therefore not recognized as an equity contribution from the GOPb. \n14 The  risk  transfer  arrangement  under  the  project  suggests  that  the  GOPb  has  retained  significant  funding  and \n\noperations risks by offering significant upfront support and guarantees during operation. \n\n15 GOPb allocations for the PDF cannot be carried over to the following fiscal year and lapse if not used.  \n16 ADB. 2014.

The  new  VGF  guidelines  will  require  that  proposals  from  line \ndepartments  include  a  VFM  assessment;  transaction  advisers  financed  under  the  PDF  will \nstructure PPP deals that offer VFM, and not simply aim to meet investor returns. \n \nThe  decision  to  adopt  an  alternative  approach  to  that  used  in  the  Sindh  project  was \n14. \ninfluenced by the GOPb\u2019s reluctance to use a VGF company, because the independence required \nfor  risk  management  and  review  and  monitoring  functions  is  already  in  place.  Separate \ngovernment  departments  oversee  the  PPPC  (which  is  within  the  PDD)  and  RMU  (within  the \nFinance Department), although some improvements and strengthening of capacity are needed. \n  \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  private  sector  investments  and  overall \n15. \nemployment  in  Punjab  increased. 19 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  viable  PPP \nprojects that offer VFM increased.20  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe outputs are (i) PDF and VGF resources for PPP projects augmented, and (ii) PPP \n\n16. \ninstitutional capacity enhanced and strengthened. \n \n17. \nOutput 1: Project Development Facility and Viability Gap Fund resources for public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  projects  augmented.  The  project  will  provide  financing  for  the  PDF  to \nsupport  line  departments  in  engaging  the  assistance of  experienced  transaction  advisors. The \nproposed ADB loan will be used to fund a dedicated VGF window that will be managed by the \nPDD. VGF guidelines will be established that will specify, among other things, (i) the applicability \nand use  of  VGF resource as capital  and/or  operational  support for  eligible PPP  projects,  (ii)  a \nreview  and  approval  process  (articulating  the  process  flow  from  application  to  approval),21 (iii) \nVGF  restrictions  of  use  (if  applicable),  (iv)  conditions  for  disbursements  of  VGF  resources  to \neligible PPP  projects,  (v) monitoring  of  performance  of  VGF-supported  projects  by  the  RMU,22 \nand  (vi)  annexes  to  further  articulate  key  provisions  of  the  VGF  guidelines.  Furthermore, \ndedicated  non-lapsable  accounts  for  VGF  and  PDF  will  be  established  in  PDD,  with  joint \ndisbursement  authorization  by  Member  PPP  (PDD  board)  and  Secretary  (PDD),  to  ensure \nsustainability  and  continuity  of  such  resources.  This  will  also  help  streamline  the  approval \nprocess, as it will require an upfront budgetary allocation for GOPb funds, with further budgetary \napprovals not required after approval by the PPP steering committee. \n \n18. \ninstitutional  capacity  enhanced  and \nstrengthened. The accompanying TA will support the capacity building component of the project, \nwhich  will  include  engagement  of  procurement  and  safeguards  specialists  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the PPPC, and engagement of project finance and contracts management experts to \nstrengthen  RMU  capacity.  These  additional  resources  will  improve  the  government\u2019s  ability  to \nthoroughly  review  PPP  proposals  and  draft  concession  agreements  for  potential  legal  risks, \ncontingent liabilities, fiscal risks, and overall VFM, and recommend an appropriate structure and \n                                                \n19 GOPb. 2015.

Lahore. \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 The use of VGF resources will be reviewed by a steering committee subcommittee, composed of steering committee \nmembers who represent the PDD, Finance Department, and private sector. Subcommittee recommendations will be \nsubmitted to the steering committee for approval. \n\nOutput  2:  Public\u2013private  partnership \n\n22 Monitoring by the RMU will include review of contingent asset and liabilities, and review and monitoring of covenants, \n\nrepayments, and/or returns on government support (with respect to the VGF). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fapproach for PPPs. This enhanced capacity will assist the PPP steering committee\u2019s decision-\nmaking process when considering PPP proposals. Subsequent to VGF approval, the RMU will \nmonitor  the  performance  of  VGF-supported  PPP  projects  and  undertake  periodic  audits  and \nreviews of VGF resources.23 An environmental and social management system (ESMS) will be \nestablished in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), with the PPPC serving \nas  the  ESMS  focal  point  for  VGF-supported  PPP  projects.  The  project  will  support  the \nengagement of a safeguards specialist for each of several selected line departments,24 including \nthe ESMS focal point in the PPPC. The VGF may provide support to eligible subprojects, which \nmay include projects that are classified as category A for the environment and resettlement, and \nthat  meet  ESMS  requirements.  Institutional  capacity  at  the  PPPC,  RMU,  and  selected  line \ndepartments  will  be  strengthened  through  the  accompanying  TA.  The  TA  will  also  support \ninformation  sessions  on  PPPs  to  help  identify  and  address  impediments  to  private  sector \nparticipation,  thereby  promoting  the  sharing  of  knowledge  regarding,  and  the  sustainability  of, \nPPPs in Punjab.  \n \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $219.6 million (Table 1). \n\n19. \n \n20. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM).25 The  majority  of  the  project  cost  (up  to  $200.0  million) \nprovides  funding  for  the  VGF  to  support  and  improve  the  commercial  viability  of  eligible  PPP \nprojects,  with  support  also  provided  ($8.4  million)  to  fund  the  PDF  to  assist  selected  line \ndepartments engage external transaction advisors to help prepare PPP projects. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nProject Development Facility \nViability Gap Fund \nSubtotal (A) \n\nItem \nA.

The PPPC will \n23. \nbe the implementing unit and will be supported by the RMU. The PDD will manage and administer \nthe VGF resources, and the RMU will monitor the performance of VGF-supported PPP projects \nin accordance with the VGF guidelines. The PDF resources will be administered by the PPPC in \naccordance with the PDF guidelines to support selected line departments to engage experienced \nexternal consultants and transactions advisors to prepare and execute PPP projects.26 The PPPC \nhas been administering PDF support to various line departments since 2010. Institutional capacity \nat  the  PPPC,  RMU,  and  selected  line  departments  will  be  strengthened  through  the \naccompanying TA (para. 26). \n \n24. \nThe executing and implementing agency will not be directly involved in implementing the \nphysical delivery of approved PPP projects. The relevant line departments will procure the PPP \nprojects, and will legally enter into the respective concession agreements with the selected private \nsector concessionaires. Procurement undertakings related to the ADB loan, including the ADB-\nadministered  grant  and  TA  grant,  will  follow  procedures  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s prior review (as required). Because \nthe  project  will  be  cofinanced  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  administered  by \nADB, universal procurement will be applied.27 \n \n25. \nDiagram 1 of the PAM (footnote 25). \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n                                                \n26 Government of Punjab.

The TA will assist in reviewing PPP project \nproposals  requiring  VGF  support,  providing  recommendations  to  the  steering  committee,  and \nmonitoring  the  performance  of those projects. The TA  will  also help facilitate the  evaluation  of \nPPP project proposals by selected line departments, and monitor projects in accordance with the \nESMS and other relevant regulations. The TA outputs are (i) improved capacity of the PPPC and \nRMU, (ii) improved capacity of selected line departments, and (iii) enhanced accountability and \ngovernance of the VGF.28 The TA will commence immediately after approval to meet provisions \nunder loan effectiveness. \n \nThe TA is estimated to cost $4,450,000, of which $4,008,724 (\u00a33,120,844 equivalent)29 \n27. \nwill  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  will  be \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  TA  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). TA funds will be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from  time to time). The  indicative implementation  time frame for  the TA  will  be  from \nNovember 2017 to December 2022. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \n28. \nInfrastructure  investment  for  Punjab  must  be  financed  in  part  by  non-public  capital \nspending, including funding from the private sector, which has been investing in energy, telecom, \nand  other  sectors.  Procurement  of  public  infrastructure  and  services  through  PPPs  offers \nopportunities to bridge Punjab\u2019s infrastructure gap. \n \n29. \nThe $100 million in ADB support to augment Punjab\u2019s VGF resources has the potential to \nraise $200 million to $300 million in additional PPP funding for infrastructure development over \n\n                                                \n28 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Exchange rate as of 14 July 2017. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nthe  project  implementation  period. 30  Private  sector  infrastructure  financing  can  bridge  the \nfinancing gap and help alleviate poverty through the jobs created by such investments. It can also \nease fiscal constraints faced by the government by allowing the private sector to assume part of \nthe  financing  burden  for  public  infrastructure  development.  The  introduction  of  private  sector \nexpertise  through  PPPs  may  also  hasten  the  completion  and  enhance  the  efficiency  of \ninfrastructure project operations.  \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe  financial  management  risk  rating,  before  risk  mitigation  measures,  is  considered \nsubstantial;  it  is  assessed  as  moderate  taking  into  account  the  risk  mitigation  measures.  The \npublic expenditure and financial accountability assessment of 2012 rates the budget credibility of \nthe province as low. The controller general of accounts has major responsibilities for accounting, \npre-audits, and payments. The GOPb is working to form a provincial internal audit authority, but \nthe only internal audit mechanism currently available is the pre-audit of transactions by the office \nof the provincial accountant general. The integrated fiscal monitoring system with consolidated \ndirect  and  contingent  liabilities  relating  to  PPP  projects  is  weak.  The  governance,  risk \nmanagement, and operational policies and procedures in the existing PPP framework for VGF \nare inadequate, due to the absence of VGF guidelines in the framework. The oversight of the PDF \nand VGF need to be improved. Actions required under the project include: (i) establishment of \nnon-lapsable reserve fund accounts for PDF and VGF, in which government funds are transferred \nas block releases; (ii) confirmation that accounting and reporting systems for the PDF and VGF \nare  satisfactory  to  ADB  in  terms  of  transparent  and  reliable  financial  reporting;  (iii)  periodic \nexternal  audits  of  VGF  and  PDF  utilization  carried  out  by  a  firm  of  chartered  accountants \nacceptable to the GOPb  and ADB;  and  (iv)  establishment  by  the  RMU  of  a system  to  monitor \ndirect and contingent liabilities related to PPP contracts. \n \n31. \nThe  PDD,  as  the  executing  and  implementing  agency,  will  use  the  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines for all institutional procurement, and ensure that procedures acceptable to ADB are \nfollowed when (i) private entities are selected through competitive bidding procedures; (ii) private \nentities  apply  their  own procedures  for  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services; \nand (iii) line departments engage consulting services financed from the PDF acceptable to ADB. \nADB will provide support for engagement of procurement expert(s) under the accompanying TA \nto assist the PDD with procurement activities. The resulting procurement risk is low, as private \nentities will  follow  procurement  procedures  acceptable to ADB.  The  ADB  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the PDD. \nPolicy requirements and supplementary measures are specified in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nC. \n \nPunjab has a 31% poverty rate; deteriorating infrastructure and social services brought \n32. \nabout by funding constraints; and wide economic, social, and political gender disparities. PPPs \nare an alternative means of procuring public infrastructure through private sector participation and \nwill help address these problems. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, \nand is expected to produce PPP projects with significant social benefits, especially for vulnerable \ngroups,  such  as  the  poor,  women  and  girls,  children,  the  elderly,  and  people  with  disabilities. \nSocial  impact  assessments  that  include  gender  as  a  key  parameter  will  be  required  for  PPP \nproject proposals. Gender training for PPPC and RMU staff will assist in assessing PPP proposals \nwith regard to  social  and gender  issues.  Screening guidelines  and tools will  incorporate  social \nand gender criteria, and women will participate in PPP training. \n                                                \n30 On the basis that average gearing offered by commercial banks for a PPP project may be 60% to 70%. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nD. \n \n33. \nIn  compliance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  is  categorized  as \nfinancial intermediary for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. 31 \nThe projects requiring VGF support may include projects that are category A for the environment \nand resettlement but C for indigenous peoples (no indigenous or tribal peoples live in or around \nthe project areas). The PDD will need to establish and maintain an ESMS acceptable to ADB that \nfully  incorporates  the  safeguard  requirements  (SR  1\u20133,  including  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation)  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. 32 Subprojects  will  not  be  eligible  for  ADB \nfinancing if they appear on ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List. The PDD will ensure the \nESMS is in place prior to ADB\u2019s first disbursement for the financing of eligible projects. \n \nPDD  staff  resources  and  skills  will  be  strengthened  by  engaging  environmental  and \n34. \nresettlement specialists at the PPPC and selected line departments under the TA. Safeguards \nspecialists hired under the TA will provide PPP training in ESMS implementation and monitoring, \nand will assist and enable the PPPC and selected line departments to manage the ESMS, and \ncomply  with  operational  guidelines  on  environment  and  social  policies,  safeguards  screening, \ncategorization  and  review  procedures,  and  oversight  during  subproject  implementation.  The \nESMS  will  be  periodically  audited  and  reviewed  by  external,  independent,  certified  auditors; \nreports (including  environmental  impact  assessments,  land acquisition  resettlement  plans,  and \nenvironmental  management  reports)  will  be  disclosed  in  line  with  ESMS  and  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement disclosure requirements. \n \nE. \n \n35. \nOverall project risks are assessed as medium.
