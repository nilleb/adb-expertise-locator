The FSPL consists of three back-to-back subprograms\nloan\nthat  will  be \neffectiveness.\n\nimplemented  within  36  months  after \n\nintermediation  and \n\nCambodia\u2019s financial sector is at a rudimentary stage with limited\nfinancial \nlow  public  confidence.  An\nunderdeveloped  financial  system  is  one  of  the  most  significant\nconstraints  to  achieving  broad-based  sustainable  economic\ngrowth  and  socioeconomic  development  objectives  of  the  Royal\nGovernment  of  Cambodia  (the  Government),  including  poverty\nreduction.  Financial  sector  development  has  been  hampered  by\nnumerous  constraints:  (i)  high  risk  related  to  uncertainties\nregarding law and contract enforcement due to lack of the rule of\nlaw,  (ii)  high  information  costs  stemming  from  lack  of  common\naccounting  and  auditing  standards  and  other \ninformation\ninfrastructure,  (iii)  high  operating  costs  due  to  the  absence  of\nliquidity  management  mechanisms \nother  market\ninfrastructure, and (iv) weak supervisory system and capacity.\n\nand \n\nfor \n\nlay \n\nthe \n\nfoundation \n\nThe FSPL will support the Government\u2019s efforts to address these\nfinancial  sector\nconstraints  and \ndevelopment. A sound, efficient, and integrated financial system\nis crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth\nand reducing poverty by enlarging job opportunities, lowering the\ntransaction  costs  of  economic  activities,  and  extending  the\noutreach of the formal financial sector to poor and rural areas. An\nefficient financial system will promote private sector development\nas  well  as  foreign  direct  investments.  Further,  a  robust  financial\nsector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable  exogenous\nincreasingly\nshocks \nglobalized financial markets.\n\nthat  are  becoming  more  common \n\nin \n\nfinancial  system \n\nThe FSPL aims to promote the development of a sound, market-\nresource\nbased \nmobilization  and  sustainable  economic  growth  by  establishing  a\nfoundation  for  the  banking  and  insurance  industries  as  well  as\nfinancial markets. the FSPL will focus on the following activities:\n\nto  support  enhanced \n\n(i) \n\nenhancing  banking  intermediation  and  public  confidence\nby  establishing  and  strengthening  banking  supervision,\ndeveloping  key  information  infrastructure  and  safety  net,\nand building capacity in both public and private sectors by\n\nObjective and\nScope\n\n\fii\n\nreinforcing capacity-building institutions;\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nestablishing legal and regulatory frameworks for insurance\ndevelopment by institutionalizing a supervisory system and\nprudential \nsector\ndevelopment  in  the  insurance  business,  and  developing\ncompulsory insurance;\n\nregulations, \n\nfostering \n\nprivate \n\nlaying the foundation for the development of interbank and\nmoney  markets  through  public-private  sector  partnership\nand by establishing a basic legal framework; and\n\nthe \n\ndeveloping \nestablishing \nenforcement  mechanisms  and  promulgating \nlaws \nunderpin the commercial activities and financial markets.\n\ninfrastructure  by\nand\nto\n\nfinancial  market \naccounting \n\nstandards \n\ncommon \n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nThe ADB Loan\n\nAmount and Terms The FSPL adopts the program cluster approach with three back-\nto-back subprograms totaling $30 million. Each subprogram loan\nwill be for $10 million and will be processed upon the successful\ncompletion of the previous subprogram.\n\nSubprogram I of FSPL will be drawn from the Asian Development\nFund, which will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0 percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.  Subprogram  I  will  be  implemented  within  12  months\nafter loan effectiveness.\n\nSubprogram  II  will  be  presented  for  Board  consideration,  based\non progress in implementing Subprogram I. Policy conditions for\nSubprogram II are subject to revision to reflect the Government\u2019s\nachievements  and  changing  policy  environment.  Subprogram  III\nwill be processed in a similar manner.  Subprograms II and III will\nbe implemented within 12 months after loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  loan  for  Subprogram  I  will  be  utilized  within  18  months,\ncommencing  from  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan\nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  procured  180\ndays  before  the  date  of  effectiveness.  The  loan  will  have  two\ntranches;  the  first  will  be  available  upon  loan  effectiveness,  and\nthe  second  will  be  released  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with\nspecified conditions indicated in the policy matrix.\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\n\fiii\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nProcurement and\nDisbursement\n\nThe  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  will  be  the  Executing\nAgency  for  the  FSPL  and  Implementing  Agencies  will  be  The\nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  the  Ministry  of\nCommerce  (MOC),  NBC,  and  the  bankers  association  when\nformed.  A  financial  sector  steering  committee  (FSSC)  will  be\nestablished to oversee implementation of the FSPL. FSSC will be\nchaired  by  the  governor  of  NBC  and  will  include  senior\nrepresentatives  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  the  Council  for  the\nDevelopment  of  Cambodia.  A  working  group  will  be  also\nestablished under FSSC to assist FSSC and oversee day-to-day\nprogram implementation.\n\nThe proceeds of the FSPL will be disbursed for a broad range of\nimports,  subject  to  compliance  with  a  negative  list  of  ineligible\nitems.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in  and\noriginating in member countries of the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB)  will  be  made  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and\nefficiency  in  accordance  with  standard  public  sector  procedures\nin  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices,\nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  Borrower  will  certify  that  the  volume  of\neligible \nthe  projected\ndisbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  in  a  given  period.  ADB  will\nhave the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify\nthe accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n\nimports  exceeds \n\nthe  amount  of \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nThe policy framework for the FSPL includes specific components\nthat bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The counterpart\nfunds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to\nfinance the structural adjustment costs under the FSPL.\n\nRisks and\nSafeguards\n\nThe  principal  risk  lies  in  unexpected  political  disturbance.\nCambodia  will  go  into  a  political  season  in  early  2002,  as  the\nNational  Assembly  and  the  Senate  of  Cambodia  passed  the\nCommune  Election  and  Commune  Administration  Laws \nin\nJanuary  and  February  2001,  respectively.  There  may  be  risks\nassociated with weak capacity at the institution level, the ability to\nretain  qualified  cadres  and  staff,  and  poor\nrecruit  and \ncoordination  between  policy-making  agencies.  There  may  be\nanother  risk  related  to  \u201claw  fatigue.\u201d  Given  the  deficient  legal\nenvironment in Cambodia, the Government has been expediting\nsubstantial  volume  of  legislation  in  a  relatively  short  period.\nHowever, there have been some cases where adopted laws are\nnot  fully  implemented,  despite  all  the  efforts  of  the  Government\nand aid agencies.\n\nThe  FSPL  includes  safeguards  in  the  design  of  the  overall\nframework  of  assistance.  First,  it  adopts  the  program  cluster\napproach,  which  introduces  flexibility  to  accommodate  various\ntypes  of  risks  by  allowing  further  refinement  of  policy  conditions\nreflecting  changing  circumstances.  The  FSPL  will  be  also\nsupported  by  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  reduce  the  downside\n\n\fiv\n\nrisks  from  weak  capacity.  An  advisory  TA  will  assist  the\nGovernment  in  implementing  the  policy  reform  measures.  Risks\nassociated  with  \u201claw  fatigue\u201d  can  be  minimized  by  instituting\nprocedures  for  broad  and  regular  consultation  with  the  private\nsector  stakeholders.  On  25  January  2001,  the  Government\nadopted  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  on  the  Formation  of  a\nSectoral  Working  Group  for  Consultation  Partnership  with  the\nPrivate  Sector,  which  mandated  the  creation  of  procedures  for\nprivate  sector  consultation  in  seven  major  areas  including\nbanking  and  financial  services.  While  it  is  understood  that  the\nprocedure  can  also  be  utilized  as  a  private  sector  consultation\nprocedure  for  legislation,  the  FSPL  supports  the  adoption  of  a\nformal consultation procedure for legislation in the banking sector\nas one of the policy conditions of Subprogram I.\n\n\f1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a (i) proposed\nprogram cluster concept for the Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL); and (ii) proposed loan\nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for Subprogram I of the FSPL.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn  May  1999,  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia  (the  Government)  requested\n2.\nassistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop its financial sector. In response,\nADB assisted the Government in developing a preliminary financial sector road map for the next\n20  years  through  a  financial  sector  study,  which  was  completed  in  June  1999.  With  technical\nassistance  (TA)1  and  building  on  the  preliminary  road  map,  a  comprehensive  financial  sector\ndiagnostic review was completed in January 2001, and the Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001-\n2010 (Appendix 1) was prepared in March 2001 to serve as the long-term development strategy\nand  phased  financial  sector  development  plan.  On  24  August  2001,  the  Government  adopted\nthe Blueprint as its official development plan in the financial sector at a Cabinet meeting chaired\nby the Prime Minister.\n\nThe  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission2  which  visited  Cambodia  in  April  2001  reached\n3.\nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  policy  reforms  that  are  to  be  supported  by  the  ADB\nloans,  the  program  structure  (use  of  the  program  cluster  approach  for  the  FSPL),  its\nsubcomponents and tranching conditions, and the implementation arrangements. The Appraisal\nMission3  in  July  2001  confirmed  and  refined  the  policy  conditions  for  the  proposed  FSPL  and\nimplementation  arrangements,  and  drafted  a  development  policy  letter  in  consultation  with  the\nGovernment. The development policy letter and policy matrix for the FSPL are in Appendixes 2\nand 3.\n\nIII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n\n4.\nAfter  a  long-standing  domestic  turmoil  and  subsequent  international  isolation  in  the\n1980s,  Cambodia  started  returning  to  a  period  of  peace  in  1993.  The  period  saw  Cambodia\nmaking steady efforts to recover in all aspects of socioeconomic development and to maintain\nsocial, political, and macroeconomic stability. International aid agency operations also resumed\nto assist Cambodia.\n\n                  \n\n1  TA 3467-CAM: Preparing for the Financial Sector Development Program, for $800,000, approved in July 2000. The\nTA commenced implementation in December 2000 and was completed in June 2001. The purpose of the TA was\nto  formulate  a  long-term  financial  sector  development  plan  and  a  financial  sector  program  loan  as  well  as  to\nconduct the preparatory work for the proposed financial sector program loan.\n\n2  The Mission comprised Byoung-Jo Chun (Financial Economist, IWFI/Mission Leader); X. Zhang (Economist, IWFI);\nR. O\u2019Sullivan (Counsel, OGC); and P. Long (Program Assistant, CARM). T. Crouch (Manager, IWFI), assisted the\nMission in the field.\n\n3  The Mission comprised Byoung-Jo Chun (Financial Economist, IWFI/Mission Leader); B. Frielink (Senior Programs\nOfficer,  PW3);  R.  O\u2019Sullivan  (Counsel,  OGC);  X.  Zhang  (Economist,  IWFI);  and  P.  Long  (Program  Assistant,\nCARM).\n\n\f2\n\nfor  1996-2000 \n\nThe  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan \n\nthe\n5.\nGovernment\u2019s  first  systematic  efforts  toward  economic  development  to  achieve  economic\ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  and  broad  participation  in  the  development  process.  After  the\nsuccessful  implementation  of  SEDP  I,  the  Government  is  finalizing  SEDP  II  for  2001-2005,\nwhich identifies poverty reduction, as the primary development goal. SEDP II targets reducing\nthe poverty rate from 36 percent4 in 1999 to around 31 percent in 2005, as well as lessening the\ndegree  of  deprivation.  These  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  promoting  broad-based  sustainable\neconomic  growth  at  6-7  percent  with  equitable  income  distribution,  (ii)  social  and  cultural\ndevelopment,  and  (iii)  ensuring  sustainable  management  in  the  use  of  natural  resources  and\nprotecting the environment.\n\nI)  marked \n\n(SEDP \n\n6.\nThe Government\u2019s strategy to achieve the poverty reduction target is to promote growth\nin all sectors, especially in agriculture because about 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas.\nMobilization and efficient allocation of resources are at the core of the economic development\nstrategy. Specifically, the Government targets the following areas:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementing \nenvironment;\n\nfiscal \n\nreforms  and  maintaining  a  stable  macroeconomic\n\nimproving efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector through reforms in the\ncivil service, judiciary, and public enterprises;\n\nenhancing  private  sector  development  while  protecting  public  interest  by  (a)\nimproving  physical  infrastructure,  (b)  developing  the  legal  and  regulatory\nframeworks within which business enterprises operate, (c) liberalizing trade and\ninvestment  policies,  and  (d)  supporting  banking  system  reform  and  financial\nsector development;\n\npromoting  agricultural  development  and  creating  off-farm  employment  in  both\nrural and urban areas; and\n\nempowering the poor to participate in, and thus benefit from, the growth process\nby  improving  their  access  to  nature  assets,  health  and  education  services,\nappropriate technology, and credit; and by removing any anti-poor distortions in\nthe product and factor markets.\n\nB. \n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\n7.\nSocial  and  political  stability  and  the  Government\u2019s  effort  for  economic  reform  have\nenabled Cambodia to achieve robust economic growth. During 1995-2000, the average annual\ngrowth  rate  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  4.6  percent,  an  impressive  performance\ncompared  with  3  percent  growth  rate  for  Southeast  Asia  over  the  same  period.  Although  the\nregional financial crisis and domestic political instability caused a substantial slowdown in 1998\nwhen the GDP growth rate plummeted to 1.5 percent, the economy regained momentum in the\nfollowing years. However, an average annual population growth of 2.5 percent has dragged per\ncapita GDP, which stagnates at around $270.\n\n                  \n\n4  The  poor  are  those  with  a  per  capita  income  level  below  the  poverty  line  of  KR54,050  per  head  per  month,\n\nequivalent to about $14 (less than $0.50 per day).\n\n\f3\n\nThe  agriculture  and  service  sectors  dominate  Cambodia\u2019s  economy,  contributing  37.6\n8.\npercent and 37.7 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2000. Agriculture in particular absorbs more\nthan  70  percent  of  employment.  On  the  other  hand,  the  industry  sector  contributed  only  14\npercent  of  GDP  in  1995,  but  has  been  the  fastest  growing  sector.  Led  by  manufacturing,  the\nindustry  sector  recorded  a  strong  average  growth  rate  of  14.7  percent  per  year  from  1995  to\n2000. In 2000, the sector contributed 21.7 percent of GDP.\n\n9.\nLow  levels  of  savings  and  investments  and  heavy  reliance  on  official  development\nassistance and foreign direct investment have limited the economic growth potential. The gross\ndomestic  savings  ratio  averaged  5.7  percent  while  the  ratio  of  gross  domestic  investment  to\nGDP  averaged  around  14.6  percent  during  1995-1999,  fluctuating  with  volatile  public\nconfidence. The gap between domestic savings and investments was filled by official transfers,\nwhich averaged 8.4 percent of GDP over the observed period.\n\n10.\nSEDP  I  saw  a  small  surplus  in  the  overall  balance  of  payments  due  to  the  improved\ntrade  balance  and  current  account,  although  the  regional  financial  crisis  deteriorated  the\ncountry\u2019s  capital  account  during  1997-1999.  The  current  account  deficit  declined  from  17.3\npercent of GDP in 1996 to 8.6 percent in 2000, with the increase in income receipts and private\ntransfers.  In  addition,  the  rapid  growth  of  exports  and  slower-than-expected  growth  of  imports\ncontributed to an improved trade balance. Exports rose from 6.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to 30.3\npercent in 2000 due to trade reform and concomitant opening of the economy to foreign direct\ninvestment.\n\n11.\nAlthough  the  overall  budget  is  still  in  deficit,  the  Government  improved  fiscal\nmanagement in the SEPD I period, which registered a positive current budget balance in 1997,\n1999,  and  2000.  With  the  introduction  of  the  value-added  tax  in  1999,  tax  revenue  more  than\ndoubled from KR446 billion in 1995 to KR1,040 billion in 2000, that is, from 5.9 percent of GDP\nto 8.8 percent of GDP. The structure of expenditures was also rationalized, as more funds were\nallocated  to  health,  education,  agriculture,  and  rural  development  areas  than  to  defense  and\nsecurity.\n\n12.\nExpanding  economic  activities  under  a  stable  social  and  political  environment  have\nboosted  financial  transactions  and  intermediation.  M25  increased  by  26.9  percent  in  2000,\nmainly  due  to  a  41.7  percent  increase  in  foreign  currency  deposits.6  During  the  same  period,\nbank loans increased 31 percent to an equivalent of $249 million, while deposits increased 40\npercent  to  an  equivalent  of  $382  million.  The  increase  in  the  loan  volume  occurred\npredominantly in the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\n13.\nThe  increased  financial  intermediation  was  accompanied  by  reinforced  dollarization  of\nthe economy, as the growth of bank deposits was driven by a sharp increase in foreign currency\ndeposits.  Dollarization  delays  the  development  of  effective  monetary  policy  and  limits  the\noutreach of formal financial intermediation into the rural and poor areas where local currency is\nused. Under SEDP II, the Government adopted a policy \u201cto promote the de-dollarization of the\n\n                  \n\n5  M2 is a broad monetary aggregate, which consists of currency in circulation, demand deposits, time and savings\n\ndeposits, and foreign currency deposits in Cambodia.\n\n6  During the same period, Viet Nam exhibited a similar pattern in trends in monetary aggregate and foreign currency\n\ndeposits. In 2000, M2 increased by 39 percent and the foreign currency deposits increased by 42.7 percent.\n\n\f4\n\neconomy  through  sustained  macroeconomic  stability  and  financial  sector  reform  with  the\ndevelopment of local currency (Cambodian riel) \u2013 denominated asset markets.\u201d7\n\n14.\nAchieving  a  sustainable  high  rate  of  economic  growth  is  crucial  to  reduce  pervasive\npoverty and to absorb the growing labor force with increased labor productivity and real wages.\nThe Government has set a long-term, real annual GDP growth target of 6.0\u20137.0 percent under\nthe  assumption  that  the  Government  will  successfully  implement  full-scale  governance  reform\npackages,  assisted  by  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies,  during  the  SEDP  II  period,  including\nlegal and judicial, public finance, civil service, and anticorruption measures. If the growth target\nis  achieved,  implying  real  annual  GDP  per  capita  growth  at  or  above  4.0  percent,  then  it  is\nexpected that Cambodia can achieve a poverty ratio of 31 percent at the end of SEDP II, a 5\npercent point reduction from the level in 1999.8\n\n15.\nIn  the  short  term,  Cambodia  is  expected  to  gradually  recover  with  modest  economic\ngrowth owing to export growth primarily in the garments sector, continued expansion of tourism,\nand  recovery  in  agriculture  from  the  flood-related  contraction  in  2000.  With  these  factors\nconsidered, it is expected that Cambodia can achieve a 5.0 percent range of economic growth\nin  2001.  In  the  long-term,  agricultural  productivity  must  rise  above  subsistence  levels  and  the\nproportion  of  the  population  engaged  primarily  in  agriculture  must  fall.  The  most  important\nmedium-term  constraints  to  reaching  that  goal  appear  to  be  (i)  the  inability  to  mitigate  the\ndamages  caused  by  flooding  and  drought,  (ii)  inadequate  natural  resource  management\n(particularly forest and fisheries), and (iii) insecure land rights.9\n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA. \n\nBackground, Constraints, and Issues\n\n1. \n\nOverview\n\n16.\nCambodia\u2019s financial sector is at a rudimentary stage with limited financial intermediation\nand low public confidence. Cambodia still has one of the lowest rates of banking intermediation\nin  the  world:  in  2000,  bank  loans  and  deposits  accounted  for  approximately  8  percent  and  12\npercent of GDP, respectively.10\n\n17.\nIn  1989,  Cambodia  started  the  transformation  from  a  mono-banking  system  to  a\ntwo-tiered system. In 1990, treasury operations were transferred to the Ministry of Economy and\nFinance  (MEF)  and  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  was  designated  as  a  ministry  and\nused largely to finance budget deficits. In 1996, NBC was established as the central bank with\n\n                  \n\n7  The Ministry of Planning, Cambodia. 2001.

De-dollarization  needs  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  to  regain  public  confidence  in  local\ncurrency,  which  includes,  among  others,  (i)  sustained  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  provision  of  local-currency-\ndenominated assets, and (iii) promotion of the money function of local currency. Improved financial intermediation\nwith enhanced public confidence in the financial system would expedite the de-dollarization process. The proposed\nsubprogram, combined with the Government\u2019s efforts in the three strategic areas, will contribute to de-dollarization\nby bolstering public confidence in the financial system.\n\n8 The Ministry of Planning, Cambodia. 2001. First Draft of the Second Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan,\n\n2001-2005. p. 1.\n\n9 CER CAM 2000-14: Country Economic Review, Cambodia, December 2000.\n10 The levels of bank lending to GDP in Lao PDR and Viet Nam stood at 17 percent and 22 percent, respectively.\n\n\f5\n\nthe promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank of Cambodia\n(the Central Banking Law).\n\n18.\nThere  has  been  steady  progress  in  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  toward  financial  sector\ndevelopment  thanks  to  political  stability.  Following  the  establishment  of  NBC  in  1996,  the\nGovernment adopted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions (the Banking Law) in 1999\nand  a  new  Insurance  Law  in  2000.  Furthermore,  from  2000,  the  Government  embarked  on  a\ncomprehensive  bank  restructuring  program  with  the  assistance  of  the  International  Monetary\nFund (IMF), to enhance public confidence in the banking system and strengthen intermediation.\n\nin \n\n19.\nCurrently Cambodia has 20 commercial banks as a result of NBC's relicensing program,\nwhich  revoked  the  licenses  of  12  nonviable  banks.  Other  operating  financial  institutions  are\ninsurance  companies,  currency  exchange  bureaus,  and  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs).\nBanking  activities  are  scarce \nthe  rural  areas,  where  microfinance  operations  of\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  are  the  main  and  de  facto  providers  of  credit.  The\ninsurance  sector  is  composed  of  a  Government-owned  insurance  entity,  Cambodia  National\nInsurance  Company  (CAMINCO),  which  acts  as  regulator,  underwriter,  and  broker;  and  four\nprivate  insurance  companies  that  are  agents  for  CAMINCO  and  risk  underwriters  through\nfronting  agreements.  There  are  no  recognized  interbank  and  money  markets  and  capital\nmarkets in Cambodia. Development of these markets will depend on such things as proper legal\nand  accounting  infrastructure,  necessary  regulatory  and  institutional  structures,  and  human\nresource capacity.\n\n20. Weak  financial  infrastructure  hampers  the  development  of  the  sector.  First,  Cambodia\nhas  yet  to  develop  or  strengthen  laws  pertaining  to  such  things  as  accounting,  insurance,\nnegotiable  instruments,  secured  transactions,  commercial  enterprises,  bankruptcy,  contracts,\nand  commercial  credit.  Furthermore,  public  confidence  in  the  legal  and  judicial  system  is\nextremely low. The lack of the rule of law has hampered the development of a formal, contract-\nbased  credit  culture  and  thus  has  been  one  of  the  primary  impediments  to  private  sector\ndevelopment  as  well.  Second,  Cambodia  has  yet  to  adopt  common  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards.  Few  companies  produce  financial  statements,  and  different  companies  produce\nfinancial  statements  using  different  standards.  Lack  of  common  accounting  standards  and\nenforcement  system  has  not  only  increased  risk  and  the  cost  of  banking  operations,  but  has\nalso prevented the early development of financial markets.\n\n2. \n\nThe Banking Sector\n\nthe  banking  system,  NBC \n\nBackground.  To  strengthen \n\n21.\nlaunched  a\ncomprehensive bank re-licensing program based on strengthened capital adequacy requirement\nand  CAMELS  rating  system.11  In  November  2000,  just  before  the  first  phase  of  NBC's  bank\nrelicensing program under IMF support, the commercial banking system consisted of 31 banks:\n2 Government-owned banks, 22 locally incorporated banks, and 7 foreign bank branches. On 8\nDecember 2000, NBC revoked the licenses of 12 banks classified as nonviable, and placed 13\nbanks  classified  as  conditionally  viable  under  memoranda  of  understanding  (MOUs)  requiring\ncompliance with restructuring measures and the prudential regulations (i.e., the minimum capital\nrequirement) by the end of 2001.\n\nrecently \n\n                  \n\n11 A  bank  evaluation  system  is  to  assess  the  bank\u2019s  soundness  in  terms  of  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,\n\nmanagement, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to the market.\n\n\f6\n\nThe  five  largest  commercial  banks,  including  the  Government-owned  Foreign  Trade\n22.\nBank (FTB), hold more than 50 percent of total banking assets and deposits. Deposits in foreign\ncurrencies,  predominantly  US  dollars,  comprise  93  percent  of  total  banking  deposits.  The  US\ndollar  is  the  primary  medium  of  exchange  with  the  Cambodian  riel,  which  is  used  primarily  in\nrural areas. The formal banking sector is concentrated in Phnom Penh, although 84 percent of\nthe population resides in rural areas.\n\n23.\nAs  of  December  2000,  the  total  assets  of  the  banking  system  stood  at  KR2,517  billion\n($644 million) or 20 percent of GDP. This represents an increase of 20 percent since the end of\n1999.  During  the  same  period,  loans  increased  31  percent  to  an  equivalent  of  $249  million,\nwhile deposits increased 40 percent to an equivalent of $382 million. Loan growth has occurred\npredominantly in the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\n24.\nDespite the low level of lending, asset quality in the banking system is poor. According to\nNBC, the volume of nonperforming loans in the banking system is substantial and growing. Lack\nof  common  accounting  standards  and  a  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  compounds  concern\nabout the accuracy of the reported nonperforming loans. The banking system provides a narrow\nrange  of  financial  instruments  usually  limited  to  demand,  saving,  and  time  deposits  on  the\nliability  side.  Loan  portfolios  tend  to  be  confined  to  a  narrow  range  of  better-known  firms.\nMoreover,  most  banks  maintain  a  high  level  of  liquidity  with  the  percentage  of  cash  to  total\nassets at roughly 19 percent, and approximately 33 percent of total assets of the whole banking\nsystem appear to be nonearning assets.\n\n25.\nHigh  risks  and  operating  costs  associated  with  bank  lending  are  reflected  in  both  high\ninterest rate spread and short-term lending. The spread between loan and deposit interest rates\nis  estimated  at  10  to  13  percentage  points,  as  loan  interest  rates  are  around  20  percent  per\nannum or higher. Typical loan maturity is three to six months. Term finance is unavailable, and\nbanks  are  reluctant  to  provide  loans  with  terms  of  one  year  or  longer.  To  overcome  this\nproblem, the usual practice is to continue rolling over short-term loans.\n\n26.\nConstraints  and  Issues.  A  number  of  factors  contribute  to  the  low  level  of\nintermediation, poor asset quality, and high operating costs of banks, which lead to poor public\nconfidence  and  limited  deposit  mobilization.  First,  uncertainties  regarding  enforceability  of\nsecurity  interests  impede  bank  lending  and  contribute  to  poor  asset  quality.  The  collateral\nregistration  system  is  rudimentary  and  unreliable  due  to  the  absence  of  laws  and  regulations\ngoverning  secured  transactions  as  well  as  an  inadequate  public  registration  system  that\nspecifies  lenders\u2019  positions  and  priority  rankings  in  secured  property.  The  system  is\ncumbersome,  as  it  forces  banks  and  other  concerned  parties  to  go  through  several  steps  to\nidentify, confirm, and register secured interest. In addition, lack of a proper collateral valuation\nsystem inhibits sound lending.\n\n27.\nSecond, lack of a reliable borrower information system impedes bank lending and leads\nto  poor  asset  quality  as  well.  Cambodia  lacks  a  credit  bureau  or  an  arrangement  for  banks  to\nshare  credit  information.  Further,  few  firms  produce  financial  statements  and  no  common\naccounting standards are enforced. Thus, banks are unable to lend based on cash-flow analysis\ndue  to  lack  of  clients\u2019  financial  information.  Consequently,  they  are  compelled  to  lend  against\ncollateral  as  the  primary  source  of  repayment,  which  is  further  compromised  by  the  lack  of\ninfrastructure for secured transactions.\n\n28.\nThird,  rudimentary  liquidity  management  mechanisms  cause  substantial  opportunity\nlosses to banks, increasing their operating costs. Except for occasional exchange of interbank\n\n\f7\n\ndeposits among a few banks, there are no formal interbank market arrangements where banks\ncan  borrow  or  lend  to  manage  liquidity.  Thus,  most  banks  maintain  abnormally  high  levels  of\nliquidity.  Lack  of  interbank  markets  stems  from,  among  others,  the  absence  of  mutual\nconfidence among banks. In addition, although the Central Banking Law provides a legal basis\nfor rediscount facilities,12 NBC is unable to provide liquidity service to commercial banks to meet\ntemporary liquidity shortages, because no eligible negotiable instruments (i.e., bills of exchange,\npromissory  notes,  etc.)  are  available  due  to  lack  of  the  necessary  legal  infrastructure  (i.e.,\nnegotiable instruments law).\n\nframework \n\nFourth,  weak  supervisory  capacity  and  a  regulatory \n\n29.\nimpedes  early\nidentification of banking problems, as well as the timely and orderly resolution of problem banks.\nPublic  confidence  has  been  undermined  mainly  because  the  supervisory  system  failed  to\nconvince the public that all banks are under the oversight of the supervisory authorities, due to\nthe  apparent  lack  of  systematic  supervision  and  prudential  regulations.  In  fact,  the  basic\nframework  and  capacity  for  on-  and  off-site  supervision,  as  well  as  a  prompt  corrective  action\nsystem  are  yet  to  be  in  place.  Weak  capacity  and  shortcomings  in  the  legal  and  regulatory\nframework  for  bank  liquidation  have  hampered  and  delayed  early  and  orderly  liquidation  of\ndelicensed banks. Both the existing bank regulations and the capacity of the Bank Supervision\nDepartment (BSD) of NBC need strengthening. In addition, the current system lacks a requisite\nbasis for effective bank supervision and prudential regulations, such as a uniform chart of bank\naccounts  and  disclosure  rules.  Like  their  borrowers,  commercial  banks  adopt  different\naccounting  standards.  Furthermore,  a  review  of  sample  financial  statements  of  commercial\nbanks  revealed  inconsistency  in  the  quality  of  the  audits  performed  by  international  firms\npartially due to the lack of common accounting and auditing standards in Cambodia.\n\n30.\nFinally, the banking system suffers from scarce human resource and capacity. Capacity\ngap  in  the  public  sector  is  one  of  the  most  acute  problems  hampering  banking  sector\ndevelopment.  The  bank  supervisory  authority  especially  needs  substantial  capacity  and\ninstitution  building  to  properly  discharge  its  responsibilities.  The  private  sector  also  requires\nsubstantial  capacity  building.  The  Government\u2019s  proactive  market  opening  policy  in  the  early\nstage  of  financial  sector  development  has  enabled  Cambodia  to  attract  many  experienced\nforeign commercial bankers into the banking sector. As a result, most of the senior managers\nare  experienced  and  competent  bankers.  However,  most  banks  have  difficulty  in  finding\nqualified working-level staff due to the legacy of long-standing domestic strife and international\nisolation. Thus, most working-level staff need substantial professional training in basic banking\noperations such as credit analysis, loan monitoring, and problem loan management.\n\n3. \n\nRural Finance\n\n31.\nBackground. The rudimentary banking system and its urban bias neither addresses the\ndemand  from  the  poor  for  microfinance  to  smoothen  consumption,  build  assets,  and  develop\nmicroenterprises; nor is it structured to meet the demand from the middle and upper segments\nof  the  rural  markets  for  financing  commercial  cultivation,  agricultural-trading,  and  rural  and\nagriculture related enterprises (e.g., rice milling and dairy).\n\n                  \n\n12 \u201dThe Central Bank shall determine the procedures or repurchase from, sell to, discount and rediscount for banks\nand  financial  institutions:  (a)  bills  of  exchange  and  promissory  notes  drawn  or  made  for  bona  fide  commercial,\nindustrial, or agricultural purposes, bearing two or more good signatures one of which must be that of a commercial\nbank  and  maturing  within  90  days  from  the  date  of  their  acquisition  by  the  Central  Bank\u2026;  and  (c)  any  private\nnegotiable claims on the money market as well as all bankers claims bearing creditworthy signature and appearing\non a list recognized by the Board,\u201d Article 36, the Central Banking Law.\n\n\f8\n\nNearly  40  percent  of  the  population  has  no  access  to  formal  bank  branches.  Only  6\n32.\npercent  of  the  total  banking  sector  advances  is  for  agriculture  or  related  activities,  primarily\nshort-term, dollar-denominated loans. The estimated rural finance demand of $120 million-$130\nmillion per annum, of which one third is for microcredit loans ranging from $50 to $300, is only\nfractionally met from institutional sources. Reliable savings facilities are generally not available\nin rural areas and to the poor.\n\n33.\nCurrently, about 90 NGOs supported by funding agencies provide microfinance to nearly\n270,000  poor  households,  or  15  percent  of  the  total.  Most  of  the  borrowers  are  women.  The\nestimated aggregate outstanding microcredit is $17 million and savings mobilized amount to $1\nmillion. Service delivery is through \u201cvillage banks\u201d comprising 100-200 members and managed\nby a village credit committee. Members are organized into groups, provided some basic training\nand individual credit with group liability. Loans varying from $50 to $300 are provided for 3-12\nmonths, with equal installments and incentives for timely repayment. Interest rates on loans are\n3.0\u20135.0  percent  per  month.  Repayment  rates  are  80-95  percent.  The  balance  of  microfinance\nsupply  is  from  informal  sources  either  based  on  reciprocity  and  social  obligations  or  from\nmoney-lenders and input suppliers.\n\n34.\nCognizant  of  the  issues,  the  Government  adopted  a  rural  credit  policy  with  the  aim  to\ndevelop  an  effective  rural  financial  system.  It  has  initiated  the  following  measures  under  the\nongoing  ADB-funded  Rural  Credit  and  Savings  Project  (RCSP)  13  and  TA  for  Rural  Financial\nServices: (i) introducing an enabling provision in the Banking Law for eligible NGOs and other\nrural finance service providers to become regulated licensed MFIs; (ii) creating a microfinance\nsupervision  department  within  NBC  to  undertake  off-site  and  on-site  supervision  of  licensed\nMFIs,  and  to  monitor  the  financial  activities  of  NGOs;  (iii)  establishing  the  Rural  Development\nBank (RDB) as an apex institution to provide financing for MFIs and commercial banks, and to\nextend  technical  support  and  training  for  MFIs;  and  (iv)  enhancing  collaboration  between  the\nGovernment, NBC, and NGOs in promoting sustainable rural finance. The Government intends\nto actively encourage the entry of commercial banks in rural finance, strengthen NBC\u2019s capacity\nto ensure orderly development of the sector, and make RDB a sustainable apex institution.\n\n35.\nConstraints  and  Issues.  While  many  factors  contribute  to  poverty,  its  most  obvious\nmanifestation is insufficient household income, lack of productive assets, and inaccessibility of\naffordable  financial  services.  The  Government  has  prioritized  the  development  of  a  policy  and\ninstitutional framework for rural finance.\n\nThe  demand  and  supply  gap  for  institutional  rural  finance  even  at  the  current  level  of\n36.\neconomic activities is significant. Demand for savings, though not quantified, is significant and\nlargely  unmet  due  to  the  absence  of  (i)  reliable  savings  facilities,  (ii)  appropriate  products,  (iii)\nhigh  cost  of  service  delivery,  (iv)  inaccessibility,  and  (v)  relative  inexperience  of  NGOs  in\nmanaging  savings.  The  supply  side  is  dominated  by  microcredit  characterized  by  short-term\nloans. The supply of term credit for agriculture and rural sectors is seriously constrained by lack\nof institutions capable of delivering and managing term credit, and lack of long-term funds. The\nlatter undermines the efforts of agricultural diversification and export promotion. Weak contract\nenforcement  also  deters  term  financing.  The  network,  orientation,  institutional  capability,  and\nfinancial  health  of  commercial  banks  combine  to  make  them  only  marginal  suppliers  of  short-\nterm rural finance.\n\n13 Loan 1741-CAM: Rural Credit and Savings Project, for $20 million, approved on 20 April 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f9\n\nThe majority of the NGOs, the sole as well as de facto suppliers of microfinance in rural\n37.\nareas,  exhibit  (i)  a  poorly  motivated  part-time  volunteer  workforce;  (ii)  weak  systems  and\nprocedures;  (iii)  reliance  on  Government  and  external  assistance;  (iv)  lack  of  commitment  to\nsustainability;  and  (v)  little,  if  any,  realization  of  the  need  to  specialize  for  efficient  delivery  of\nfinancial services.\n\n4. \n\nThe Insurance Sector\n\nBackground.  Although  the  insurance  sector  is  still  at  its  nascent  stage,  there  will  be\n38.\nsubstantial potential for growth once adequate legal and regulatory infrastructure is put in place.\nFor  example,  legislative  actions  to  require  a  third-party-liability  motor  insurance  and  life\ninsurance  would  create  substantial  demand  for  insurance  to  comply  with  the  laws  and\nregulations.  The  insurance  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  mobilizing  long-term  domestic\nresources, complementing the intermediation role of the banking sector, even in the early stage\nof financial sector development as demonstrated in many developing countries.\n\nThe  insurance  sector  consists  of  the  Government-owned  insurance  entity  CAMINCO,\n39.\nwhich  acts  as  regulator  and  underwriter,  and  four  private  insurance  companies  that  act  as\nagents  for  CAMINCO.  As  part  of  the  current  restructuring  and  corporatization  program,\nCAMINCO  will  be  transformed  into  a  private  company  through  joint  venture  with  one  of  the\nprivate insurance companies. The Government is expected to sign up a joint-venture agreement\nwith the candidate company soon, in which MEF will still hold the lion\u2019s share.\n\nMost  policy  purchasers \n\n40.\ninternational\norganizations.  And  the  main  sources  of  business  include  property,  health,  marine  cargo,  and\nmotor vehicles. CAMINCO has also made reinsurance arrangements with foreign partners in the\nregion and European countries. Other products expected in the future are livestock insurance,\ncrop insurance, and life insurance.\n\nin  Cambodia  are \n\ninvestors  and \n\nforeign \n\n41.\nThe year 2000 was a watershed period in insurance sector development. The National\nAssembly adopted a long-awaited Insurance Law in July 2000, and the Government committed\nitself  to  gradual  commercialization  and  privatization  of  CAMINCO.  The  new  Insurance  Law\ncovers:  general  provisions;  property  insurance,  life,  and  personal  insurance;  compulsory  third-\nparty-liability  motor  insurance;  construction  insurance  and  insurance  for  passenger  transport;\ninsurance  company  and  state  control;  insurance  agents  and  brokers;  and  legal  penalties.  The\nGovernment is now drafting a subdecree that will flesh out detailed prudential regulations and\nprocedures  to  implement  the  law.  The  first  draft  was  submitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  for\napproval in March 2001, and is expected to be effective this year.\n\n42.\nAs  part  of  the  commercialization/privatization  effort  of  CAMINCO,  its  regulatory\nresponsibility was transferred to the Insurance Office that was established under the Financial\nIndustry  Department  of  MEF  in  March  2001.  Key  officials  in  the  Insurance  Office  were\ntransferred from the supervisory unit of CAMINCO. The Government also nominated the former\npresident of CAMINCO as the Insurance Commissioner.\n\n43.\nConstraints  and  Issues.  The  insurance  sector  has  been  constrained  by  weak\nsupervisory  and  regulatory  framework  and  capacity,  let  alone  low  income  and  lack  of  public\nawareness  of  the  insurance  sector.  Although  the  Government  adopted  the  Insurance  Law  in\n2000, it has yet to adopt a subdecree implementing the law and basic prudential regulations on\nsuch things as uniform chart of accounts, disclosure rules, investment guidelines, and solvency\nrequirements.\n\n\f10\n\nSecond, an effective enforcement and monitoring mechanism to implement compulsory\n44.\ninsurance  needs  to  be  established.  While  the  introduction  of  compulsory  insurance  in  the\nInsurance Law (i.e., compulsory third-party-liability motor insurance, construction insurance, and\ninsurance  for  passenger  transport)  was  hailed  as  a  breakthrough  by  the  private  sector,\ncompulsory insurance cannot be fully implemented by a framework law alone. Implementation\ncritically  relies  on  a  well-organized  enforcement  and  monitoring  system  that  is  supported  by  a\ncouple  of  supporting  laws  that  require  the  purchase  of  compulsory  insurance  policy.  This,  in\nturn, requires interministerial efforts and coordination.\n\n45.\nThird, the framework for private sector development in the insurance sector needs to be\nstrengthened.  The  introduction  of  compulsory  insurance  is  expected  to  create  a  policy-driven\ndemand  for  insurance.  However,  without  a  framework  that  fosters  fair  competition  between\nstate-owned  and  private  companies,  and  between  incumbent  and  prospective  companies,  the\ncompulsory insurance market will be susceptible to distortions in pricing and quality of services,\nwhich  will  in  turn  undermine  public  confidence  in  compulsory  insurance.  The  Government  has\nalready  taken  an  important  initiative  toward  private  sector  development  by  adopting  a\nprivatization  policy  for  CAMINCO.  However,  a  couple  of  issues  remain  to  be  addressed.  The\nGovernment should exert efforts to divest its ownership in the insurance sector. Since MEF is\nnow  responsible  for  insurance  supervision,  the  Government\u2019s  holding  the  lion\u2019s  share  in  the\nlargest  insurance  company  will  not  only  pose  conflict  of  interest  in  supervision,  but  also\nundermine  fair  competition.  Thus,  the  partial  privatization  of  CAMINCO  through  joint  venture\nshould  be  ultimately  linked  to  divestiture  of  the  Government  shares  in  the  joint  venture  in  the\nmedium-term. Secondly, the Government needs to develop a transparent entry mechanism, to\nfoster competition by giving equal opportunities to both state-owned and private companies.\n\n46.\nFinally,  the  new  insurance  supervisor  needs  substantial  capacity  building.  MEF  has\nsuccessfully  retained  experienced  regulators  from  CAMINCO,  but  additional  staff  and\nsubstantial capacity building are still needed to help them discharge responsibilities anticipated\nunder the Insurance Law, as well as to undertake the development role in the insurance sector.\nRecently, the authorities sought international cooperation, such as from the Malaysia Insurance\nInstitute,  in  training  the  current  supervisory  staff  and  establishing  an  insurance  training\ninstitution in Cambodia over the medium term. Capacity building must target the key staff in the\nInsurance  Office  of  MEF,  as  well  as  those  in  the  line  ministries,  which  will  be  involved  in\nenforcing and monitoring for compulsory insurance.\n\n5. \n\nInterbank and Money Markets\n\n47.\nBackground.  There  are  no  recognized  interbank  and  money  markets  operating  in\nCambodia  other  than  intermittent  occasional  exchange  of  deposits  among  a  few  banks  who\ntrust each other. The lack of interbank markets increases banking operating costs. Since there\nis  no  way  to  manage  liquidity,  most  banks  are  forced  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  non-earning\nassets, incurring opportunity costs. The percentage of cash to total assets amounts to roughly\n19 percent, and 33 percent of total assets are nonearning assets.\n\nConstraints  and  Issues.  Several  factors  hinder  the  establishment  of  interbank/money\n48.\nmarkets  in  Cambodia.  First,  lack  of  mutual  confidence  among  commercial  banks  hinders\ninterbank market service. There must be a forum to build mutual confidence among banks and\nto discuss a common policy agenda. To begin with, commercial banks need to work together to\nestablish  an  inclusive  bankers  association  and  obtain  official  recognition  from  the  authorities.\nSecond,    lack  of  a  legal  basis  for  money  market  instruments  also  hinders  the  development  of\n\n\f11\n\ninterbank  markets.  To  improve  the  current  situation,  establishing  a  legal  basis  for  negotiable\ninstruments must be a prime consideration in legislation.\n\n6. \n\nCapital Markets\n\n49.\nBackground.  Under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  initiative,  the  Government  has  made\nconsiderable  efforts  to  lay  the  foundation  for  capital  market  development.  The  Government\ndrafted  a  capital  market  law  in  1995;  unfortunately,  this  initiative  was  interrupted  due  to  the\npolitical  disturbance  in  1997.  Even  after  1997,  little  progress  was  made  owing  to  the  delay  in\ndeveloping the requisite financial and legal infrastructure.\n\n50. With  progress  in  the  governance  reform  assisted  by  ADB  and  World  Bank,  the\nGovernment  is  now  renewing  its  efforts  for  capital  market  development.  For  instance,  the\nGovernment  has  established  a  capital  market  unit  in  MEF.  The  Government  is  also  drafting  a\nsubdecree to create an independent securities supervisory body responsible for attending to all\nof the functions of capital markets and bringing about its full operation.\n\n51.\nOn the other hand, the Central Banking Law (1996) assigns to NBC the responsibility for\nestablishing  and  overseeing  financial  markets.  According  to  the  law,  NBC  has  duties  and\nfunctions in forming and supervising the money and financial markets. In addition, the Central\nBanking  Law  empowers  NBC  to  conduct  securities  operations  to  facilitate  the  registration,\ndistribution and trade of securities issued by the Government (Title VI, Article 23). NBC will have\nto delegate these powers to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once the latter is\ncreated.\n\n52.\nConstraints  and  Issues.  Capital  markets  cannot  go  forward  until  proper  accounting,\nlegal,  and  other  financial  infrastructure  are  in  place  and  the  legal  and  accounting  professions\nare organized and operational. Not only is it necessary to draft and pass the key laws currently\nunder  preparation;  the  implementing  institutions  must  be  formed  and  developed.  More\nimportantly, there must be a critical mass of potential listing companies who are willing to accept\nhigher  standards  of  corporate  governance  and  capable  of  producing  audited  financial\nstatements. Thus, the Government needs to conduct a feasibility study to assess a critical mass\nof issuers in line with the promulgation of the law on commercial enterprises.\n\n7. \n\nLegal Infrastructure\n\nBackground. Financial sector development depends on an adequate body of laws that\n53.\ninclude  such  things  as  contracts,  bankruptcy,  collateral,  and  loan  recovery.  To  enforce  these\nlaws, a body of ethical  and professional lawyers and judges, and a reliable and efficient  court\nsystem whose decisions are enforceable must be in place.\n\n54.\nA  civil  code  and  procedures  are  currently  being  drafted  with  assistance  from  Japan\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency.  These  laws  will  provide  a  legal  basis  from  which\nstakeholders  in  the  financial  sector  will  obtain  their  rights  and  liabilities  and  their  causes  of\naction.  The  civil  code  should  be  drafted  to  ensure  certainty  in  basic  contract  law  principles,\nincluding rights attached to securities and rules governing the transfer of those rights. Because\nthese  laws  are  yet  to  be  in  place  in  Cambodia,  specific  legislation  can  supplement  the\ndeficiency.\n\n55.\nThe Ministry of Commerce (MOC) has submitted to the Council of Ministers a draft law\non commercial enterprises that is being debated and is expected to be submitted to the National\n\n\f12\n\nAssembly this year. It is expected that the National Assembly will adopt the law by mid-2002. In\nMay 2000, Cambodia ratified adherence to the New York Convention on commercial arbitration,\nand is now drafting a commercial arbitration procedure. MOC is also drafting a bankruptcy law\nand a secured transactions law.\n\n56.\nThe  Government  is  moving  forward  with  judiciary  reform  as  an  integral  part  of\ngovernance  reform.  The  Government  has  adopted  the  Governance  Action  Plan,  which\nunderscores \ninspection,  and\nimportance  of  human  resource  development,  court \ninfrastructure.  Moreover,  the  Ministry  of  Justice  has  drafted  a  law  on  the  organization  and\nfunction  of  a  court  system,  which  includes  establishing  a  commercial  chamber  and  four  other\nchambers in the district court. The Council of Ministers is currently reviewing the draft.\n\nthe \n\nto  commercial \n\nlaws  pertaining \n\ninstruments,  secured \n\nConstraints  and  Issues.  The  Government  needs  to  exert  efforts  to  prioritize  the\n57.\nadoption of necessary laws that it can expedite the legislation process. With regard to financial\nsector  development, \nincluding  accounting,\ntransactions \nnegotiable \ntransactions,  commercial  enterprises,  bankruptcy,  and\ncontracts must have first priority. The law on corporate accounts, their audit, and the accounting\nprofession  (accounting  and  auditing  law)  and  law  on  commercial  enterprises  must  be\nestablished  to  lay  the  foundation  for  capital  market  development.  Afterwards  the  Government\nmay proceed to adopt a securities and exchange law (or redraft the capital market law).14 In line\nwith  the  adoption  of  the  law  on  commercial  enterprises,  a  bankruptcy  law  must  be  adopted,\nparticularly  to  bolster  the  liquidation  of  banks  delicensed  on  8  December  2000.  In  addition,  a\nsecured  transactions  law  and  negotiable  instruments  law  must  be  established  to  underpin\nbanking and commercial activities.\n\n58.\nThe  establishment  of  a  law  enforcement  mechanism  should  also  be  addressed  in  a\nsystematic way. Most importantly, the Government should move forward with the judicial reform\naddressed  in  the  Governance  Action  Plan.  With  regard  to  financial  sector  development,  the\nGovernment  should  also  draft  a  plan  to  establish  a  public  registration  system  for  secured\ntransactions  and  make  efforts  to  maintain  public  confidence  in  such  an  enforcement\nmechanism.\n\n8. \n\nAccounting and Auditing System\n\n59.\nBackground.  Cambodia  has  yet  to  adopt  common  accounting  and  auditing  standards\nand  to  establish  an  enforcement  mechanism.  MEF's  Commission  for  Accounting  Reform  has\nendorsed  the  adoption  of  International  Accounting  Standards  (IAS)/International  Standards  on\nAuditing (ISA) as core principles of accounting standards, and has submitted a draft accounting\nand auditing law to the Council of Ministers for consideration.\n\nCurrently,  the  local  offices  of  two  international  accounting  firms  and  several  local  firms\n60.\nundertake most of the auditing services in Cambodia. The international firms together employ a\nstaff  of  approximately  125  and  serve  about  400  clients,  of  which  30-40  percent  are  private\nsector  companies.  Many  private  sector  companies  are  the  local  affiliates  of  international\n\n                  \n\n14 Such recommendation on the sequence of legislation is also supported by a previous ADB study on Cambodia\u2019s\nfinancial management and governance issues. The study suggests that \u201cThe current draft Capital Market Law and\nthe draft Law on Commercial Enterprises be reviewed and replaced by a comprehensive Law on companies and,\nat  the  appropriate  time,  a  further  law  be  drafted  regarding  the  establishment  of  a  Securities  and  Exchange\nCommission  and  a  Stock  Exchange.\u201d  See  Narayan,  F.  B.,  and  T.  Gordon,  2000.  Financial Management and\nGovernance Issues in Cambodia: Diagnostic Study of Accounting and Auditing. Manila: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\f13\n\ncompanies  and  the  audited  information  is  sent  to  the  home  office  for  inclusion  in  the\nconsolidated  accounts.  At  present  most  senior  accountants  and  all  the  managers  are\nexpatriates.  Both  international  firms  have  looked  into  certification  of  Cambodian  staff  using\nprograms  from  the  Association  of  Chartered  Certified  Accountants.  Although  the  inspections\nmay be taken locally, this program is very expensive as the training courses are offered in Viet\nNam. The demand for trained auditors is expanding rapidly and will increase dramatically once\nan accounting and auditing law and common standards are established.\n\nNBC has a broad legal mandate to regulate nearly all issues related to accounting and\n61.\nauditing of banks. This goes beyond the usual prudential regulations to include establishing the\nrules for measurement, recognition, and disclosure in the financial statements and consolidation\nof  accounts.  The  Central  Banking  Law  also  permits  NBC  to  establish  the  banking  sector\naccounting  standards  separate  from  the  tax  regulations.  NBC  has  drafted  a  uniform  chart  of\naccounts for banks. Most of the accounting policies are taken verbatim from the \u201cFramework for\nthe  Preparation  and  Development  of  Financial  Statements\u201d  published  in  July  1989.  However,\nthere  are  some  substantive  changes  so  that  the  resulting  financial  statements  will  not  be  in\naccordance with IAS.\n\n62.\nConstraints and Issues. Given the importance of the accounting and auditing system in\nCambodia, the Government needs to expedite the promulgation of the accounting and auditing\nlaw  and  the  adoption  of  common  accounting  and  auditing  standards.15  While  the  Government\nhas  already  committed  to  adopt  IAS/ISA  in  their  entirety,  it  should  carefully  work  out  an\nimplementation plan to phase in IAS/ISA, considering the limited capacity and compliance cost\nof the private sector.\n\n63.\nThe  Government  should  play  a  pivotal  role  in  establishing  an  enforcement  system  for\naccounting  and  auditing  standards.  Upon  adoption  of  the  accounting  and  auditing  law,  the\nGovernment  should  establish  an  accounting  standards  authority  as  well  as  a  professional\nassociation  of  accountants  and  auditors.  An  association  serves  a  number  of  important\nregulatory  functions  in  the  public  interest.  In  the  early  stages  of  development,  an  association\ncan  provide  a  forum  for  practitioners  to  communicate  with  the  Government  and  educational\ninstitutions.  An  association  can  also  play  a  role  in  communicating  best  practices  to  members\nand  thus  help  to  reduce  the  cost  of  training  staff  members  by  combining  the  resources  of\nmember  firms.  A  more  mature  association  can  assume  regulatory  functions,  including\ncertification  of  new  auditors  and  enforcement  of  a  code  of  ethics,  and  may  offer  continuing\neducation  programs.  The  draft  accounting  and  auditing  law  included  provisions  for  creating  a\nnational accounting council and an institute of Khmer auditors and accountants under the aegis\nof  MEF.  The  international  best  practice  for  such  organizations  is  that  they  be  private  sector\nentities.  However,  regardless  of  how  responsibilities  are  divided,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for\nestablishing such an association.\n\n9. \n\nHuman Resource Development\n\n64.\nBackground. Lack of human resource capacity is a major impediment to financial sector\ndevelopment in Cambodia. There is great need for formal training in core skills (e.g., banking,\n\n                  \n\n15 The  rationale  for  adoption  of  international  standards  is  that,  first,  it  is  time-consuming  and  expensive  to  develop\nnational standards; second, it is also time-consuming for users to learn national standards in addition to IAS. Even\nthe largest economies today are moving toward adoption of IAS.\n\n\f14\n\naccounting, statistical analysis, and general management) and specialized competencies for the\neffective operation of a market-driven economy in both public and private sectors.\n\n65.\nA number of institutions and organizations play a role in developing of human resources\nfor  the  financial  sector  in  Cambodia.  They  include  universities  and  business  schools,\ncommercial  banks,  bankers  associations,  the  Centre  for  Banking  Studies  (CBS)  under  NBC,\nand  MEF.  Each  commercial  bank  operating  in  Cambodia  assumes  individual  responsibility  for\nits internal training program. The commitment of resources to training differs from bank to bank.\nForeign  commercial  banks  normally  send  their  employees  for  training  overseas.  Capacity\nbuilding activities for NBC are  primarily undertaken by CBS. CBS was established in 1995 for\nNBC staff; since 1996, it has been transformed into a broader training facility for both NBC and\noutsiders  (high  school  graduates).  CBS  currently  offers  a  2.5  years  (5  semesters)  associate\u2019s\ndegree program, recognized by the Ministry of Education. As of July 2000, CBS has graduated\n443.\n\n66.\nConstraints and Issues. While CBS has contributed initially to filling the capacity gap in\nthe  early  stage  of  banking  development,  the  scope  and  quality  of  training  services  are  not\nenough to meet the needs of the private sector and so it remains a training school for entry-level\nNBC employees. At this time, all CBS instructors are working part-time and salary payments are\nstill  largely  based  on  academic  degrees  rather  than  teaching  ability.  CBS  instructors  receive\nhourly  compensation,  considerably  less  than  that  typically  paid  by  the  business  universities.\nTherefore, CBS has been unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified instructors.\n\n67.\nCommercial  banks  will  continue  to  send  their  employees  outside  of  Cambodia  at  high\ncost until adequate training is available in the country. Many commercial banks have indicated\nthe  need  for  a  professional  training  program  in  Phnom  Penh;  they  further  indicated,  however,\nthat they will only send their employees to training that is practical and relevant, and taught by\nexperienced  bankers.  One  reason  for  the  absence  of  professional  training  is  the  difficulty  of\nhiring qualified instructors with the practical commercial banking experience necessary to teach\ncourses  such  as  credit  analysis,  letters  of  credit,  foreign  exchange,  bank  operations,  and\nassets/liabilities management.\n\nA  bankers  association  is  the  logical  home  for  a  professional  training  program  for\n68.\nbankers.  By  pooling  their  resources  and  using  experienced  commercial  bankers  to  teach\ntraining programs, a bankers association can be an effective means for providing training to the\ncommercial  banking  sector.  Upon  creation  of  a  comprehensive  bankers  association,  the\nassociation should first establish a professional training program. The training program should\nalso be open to staff of MFIs.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n69.\nADB has supported the Government in developing its long-term vision and development\nstrategy and plan for the financial sector. The objective of the long-term development plan is to\ndevelop  a  sound,  market-based  financial  system  that  is  competitive,  integrated,  and  efficient.\nThe long-term vision is that the financial sector will double in size relative to GDP in 10 years.\nThe vision will be achieved by ensuring the following:\n\n(i) \n\na  competitive,  safe,  and  sound  banking  system  that  is  well  regulated  and\nsupervised  and  effectively  mobilizes  savings  to  provide  financing  to  support  the\ngrowth of the private sector;\n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n15\n\nthe establishment and development of nonbank financial institutions that increase\nthe depth of the financial sector by providing a broad array of diversified services\nincluding leasing and consumer finance;\n\nan  insurance  sector  that  protects  businesses  and  individuals  from  catastrophic\nevents  and  a  pension  system  that  provides  a  secure  retirement,  both  of  which\nprovide capital for long-term investment in the real sector;\n\na  safe  and  reliable  system  for  the  transfer  of  funds  between  customers  and\nbanks and the settlement of payments between banks;\n\nmoney  markets  that  facilitate  interbank  markets  that  provide  banks,  companies,\nand individuals with the means for effectively managing liquidity;\n\nefficient  and  transparent  capital  markets  with  a  critical  mass  of  issuers  that\nmobilizes funds for long-term investment;\n\na  legal  system  that  promotes  and  enforces  the  rule  of  law  in  commercial  and\nfinancial \nthat  supports  good  governance  by  promoting\ntransparency, accountability, participation, and predictability;\n\ntransactions  and \n\nan  accounting  and  auditing  system  based  on  international  standards  that\nsupports  good  governance  by  promoting \ntransparency,  accountability,\nparticipation, and predictability; and\n\nhuman  resource  development  based  on  performance-based  compensation  and\npromotion,  and  the  availability  of  a  broad  range  of  professional  programs  that\nretrain existing staff and provide ongoing training.\n\nmaintain sound fiscal and monetary policies to ensure macroeconomic stability;\n\nestablish  systematically  a  sound  legal  framework  to  protect  property  rights  and\nenforce contracts;\n\nestablish  the  rule  of  law  through  legal/judicial  reform  and  law  enforcement  to\nunderpin financial and commercial activities;\n\ninfrastructure,  particularly  a\nsequence  efforts \npayment/clearing  system,  accounting  and  auditing  system,  credit  information\nsystem, and regulatory framework;\n\nto  develop \n\nfinancial \n\nstructure the regulatory and policy framework to foster competition in the financial\nmarkets and to encourage financial institutions to realize economies of scale and\nscope;\n\nestablish a regulatory and institutional framework to promote sound governance\nprinciples  and  to  allow  market  discipline  to  work  in  the  management  and\noperations of financial institutions;\n\nTo  achieve  the  long-term  vision,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  long-term  strategy  for\n\n70.\nthe financial sector to\n\n\f16\n\n(vii) \n\nestablish  a  sound  framework  for  private  sector  development  in  the  financial\nsystem by phasing out state ownership and state intervention in the system;\n\n(viii) \n\ndevelop  a  transparent  entry  framework  to  encourage  allocation  efficiency  and\nfinancial deepening;\n\n(ix) \n\ndevelop an efficient exit mechanism for troubled institutions (such as liquidation,\nmerger  and  acquisition)  to  foster  continuous  reorganization  in  the  financial\nsystem without incurring social costs; and\n\n(x) \n\ndevelop  human  and  institutional  capacity  in  both  private  and  public  sectors\nthrough a public-private sector partnership.\n\n71.\nUnder  the  long-term  strategy,  the  Government  has  adopted  the  long-term  financial\nsector development plan, or the Financial Sector Development Blueprint as its official financial\nsector  development  plan.  The  FSPL  is  a  critical  component  to  support  the  Government\u2019s\nimplementation of Phase I of the Blueprint.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nIn  addition  to  ADB,  IMF  has  been  a  major  contributor  to  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector\n72.\ndevelopment.  Since  1994,  IMF  has  provided  support  to  develop  Cambodia\u2019s  monetary  policy\nand central bank operations. In October 1999, IMF approved the Poverty Reduction and Growth\nFacility  (PRGF)  for  Cambodia  for  SDR58.5  million  (equivalent  to  $81.6  million)  to  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s economic program for 1999-2002. The reform agenda under the PRGF includes\n\n(i) \n\navoiding central bank financing of the budget (1999-2002);\n\n(ii) \n\ncompleting on-site inspection for all private banks (1999);\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimproving supervision capacity, including strengthening staff capacity and setting\nsupervision guidelines (1999-2002);\n\nstrengthening the legal framework by adopting a new law on commercial banks\nand financial institutions (November 1999);\n\nrelicensing all existing commercial banks under the new Banking Law and close\ndown those that do not comply with the law (2000-2002); and\n\n(vi) \n\nrestructuring the FTB (1999-2001).\n\n73.\nIMF\u2019s  recent  review  mission  noted  Cambodia\u2019s  \u201cstrong\u201d  performance  reflected  in  \u201ca\nresumption of growth, low inflation, and significant progress in major areas of structure reform,\u201d\nand  supported the  tranche release of the PRGF.16 In  banking  reform,  it  noted  NBC\u2019s  action  in\nclosing nonviable banks, and emphasized the importance of closely monitoring the conditionally\nviable banks, which are under restructuring MOU. It also urged the Government\u2019s \u201ctimely action\nwhen those MOU banks do not meet the requirements.\u201d\n\n16 IMF. 2001. Cambodia: Second Review Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.\n\n                  \n\n\f17\n\nThe World Bank has been assisting in drafting an accounting and auditing law. Together\n74.\nwith ADB,17 the World Bank also assists the Government in adopting IAS/ISA and establishing\nenforcement  mechanisms  such  as  an  accounting  and  auditing  standard  board  and  an\naccounting  professional  association.  In  addition,  based  on  ADB\u2019s  seminal  work  in  governance\nreform,18 the World Bank joined ADB and the United Nations Development Programme to help\nthe Government in adopting the Governance Action Plan.\n\n75.\nThe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  is  assisting  Cambodia  in  financial  sector\ndevelopment  through  TA  and  the  Mekong  Project  Development  Facility  (MPDF).  One  TA  was\nlaunched in February 2001 to help the Government formulate the restructuring and privatization\nplan for FTB. The TA focuses on advising the Government on the approach to restructuring and\nprivatization  without  getting  involved  in  the  actual  process.  Another  TA  under  consideration\nintends to assist in training future capital market regulators in anticipation of the establishment\nof  a  SEC  and  securities  exchange  in  the  near  future.  MPDF,  an  IFC  facility,  is  to  assist  and\naccelerate the development of productive, self-sustaining small- and medium-sized enterprises\n(SME)  in  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  Viet  Nam.  MPDF  is\nalso  charged  with  improving  the  enabling  environment  for  SME  development.  The  principal\nactivities  of  MPDF  cover  two  areas:  investment  evaluation  and  preparation,  and  in-country\ndevelopment  program.  Specifically,  it  facilitates  bank  lending  to  SMEs  through  bank  training,\ndeveloping the bankers association, and a TA to one of the leading local commercial banks. In\naddition,  MPDF  aims  at  developing  new  forms  of  financing,  such  as  trade  financing  facilities,\nleasing, and venture capital.\n\nD. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n76.\nADB\u2019s country operational strategy specifies three priority areas: (i) support for pro-poor,\nsustainable  economic  growth  through  interventions  to  relieve  key  constraints  to  broad-based\nagricultural  growth;  (ii)  a  focus  on  human  resource  development;  and  (iii)  development  of  an\nenabling  environment  for  the  private  sector  through  selected  interventions  in  transportation,\nfinance, and energy.\n\n77.\nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  finance  and  industry  sector  consists  of  four  advisory  TA\n(ADTAs)  and  one  project  preparatory  TA  (PPTA):  (i)  Cambodia  Development  Bank  ($31,000),\napproved in January 1973; (ii) Institutional Strengthening of the CBS and State-Owned Banks\u2019\nStaff Training ($340,000), approved in May 1995; (iii) Strengthening Capacity in the Trade and\nIndustry Sectors ($600,000), approved in May 1996; (iv) Enhancing Banking Skills ($400,000),\napproved  in  May  1997;  and  (v)  PPTA  for  the  FSPL  ($800,000),  approved  in  July  2000.  In  the\nrural finance sector, a PPTA on Rural Credit & Savings ($600,000) was approved in June 1997.\nADB  launched  a  $20  million  Rural  Credit  and  Savings  Project  Loan  in  April  2000.  For  SME\ndevelopment,  ADB  is  supporting  MPDF  under  a  regional  TA  for  Small-  and  Medium-Sized\nEnterprises Growth and Development in the Mekong Region ($750,000), approved in November\n2000;  and  approved  an  equity  investment  of  $5  million  in  the  Mekong  Enterprises  Fund  in\nAugust 2000.\n\n                  \n\n17 ADB has provided a comprehensive diagnostic study of accounting and auditing to help develop an accounting and\nauditing standards and enforcement mechanism consistent with international standards. See Narayan, F. B., and\nT.  Gordon,  2000.  Financial Management and Governance Issues in Cambodia: Diagnostic Study of Accounting\nand Auditing. Manila: Asian Development Bank.\n\n18 Kato, T., J. A. Kaplan, Chan Sophal, and Real Sopheap. 2000. Cambodia: Enhancing Governance for Sustainable\n\nDevelopment. Manila: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\f18\n\n78.\nADB  undertook  a  financial  sector  strategy  study  in  1999  that  produced  a  preliminary\nroad  map  for  financial  sector  development  over  the  next  20  years.  Based  on  the  preliminary\nroad  map,  ADB  provided  a  PPTA  for  preparing  a  financial  sector  development  program,\ncompleted the in-depth diagnostic review of constraints to the financial sector, and produced a\nlong-term  financial  sector  vision  and  three-stage  sector  development  plan,  or  the  Financial\nSector Blueprint for 2001-2010.\n\nThe Blueprint comprises a long-term development strategy and subsector development\n79.\nplan.  The  long-term  strategy  is  developed  based  on  key  lessons  from  the  experiences  of\nfinancial sector development and reform in Asia and other transition economies. The long-term\nobjective  is  to  guide  the  subsector  development  strategy.  Each  subsector  development  plan\nconsists of a development goal, intermediate reform agenda, and illustrative policy measures in\neach phase. The development goal describes the subsector strategy to achieve visions in each\nsubsector  over  three  phases:  2001-2004,  2005-2007,  and  2008-2010.  The  intermediate\nagendas are selected to help (i) identify specific policy measures to achieve the set goals, and\n(ii) sequence and pace such policy measures. At the same time, a series of reforms over three\nphases  suggest  sequencing  tactics  for  development  efforts  in  a  specific  subsector.  These\nreform agendas, however, include built in flexibility, to enable policymakers to add or refine the\nagenda  to  reflect  development  progress  in  each  subsector  and  each  phase  in  concert  with\nchanging financial market conditions.\n\nE. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nExperiences  from  financial  sector  development  and  reforms  in  Asian  economies  and\n80.\nother  transition  economies  (for  example,  Viet  Nam  and  Lao  PDR)  are  well-documented  in\nvarious  studies  and  by  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies\u2019  project  experiences,  and  offer  valuable\nlessons  to  consider  for  financial  sector  development  in  Cambodia.  In  developing  a  long-term\nstrategy and program loan for financial sector development, the following are noteworthy:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nA  sound  fiscal  policy  and  price  stability  are  the  preconditions  for  a  well-\nfunctioning financial system.\n\nThe financial sector will not develop without public confidence in protection and\nsecurity of property rights and contract enforcement.\n\nA  sound  financial  sector  cannot  be  created  without  establishing  the  rule  of  law,\nsupported by appropriate legal/judiciary system and law enforcement.\n\nFor  efficient  financial  intermediation,  it  is  necessary  to  develop  the  financial\nmarket  infrastructure,  particularly  an  accounting  and  auditing  system,  a  credit\ninformation system, and a regulatory framework.\n\nSound competition in financial markets is one of the key driving forces that lead\nto  achieve\nto \neconomies of scale and scope.\n\nfinancial  deepening  by  encouraging \n\ninstitutions \n\nfinancial \n\n(vi) \n\nA  sound  financial  system  builds  on  sound  governance  principles  and  strong\nmarket discipline, which support a strong credit culture.\n\n\f19\n\n(vii) \n\nState ownership of financial institutions and state intervention in the allocation of\nfinancial resources hinder the development of a market-based financial sector.\n\n(viii)  Strict  entry  regulation  in  financial  industries  is  one  of  the  factors  that  adversely\n\naffect financial development and the allocational efficiency of investment funds.\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nLax entry requirements under a weak supervisory system result in an excessive\nnumber of poorly managed banks.\n\nFor  sustainable  financial  sector  development,  it  is  crucial  to  build  up  market-\noriented  management  and  a  sound  system  of  operations  and  improvements  in\ntechnical  competence,  commensurate  with  the  desired  change  in  the  financial\nstructure.\n\nADB\u2019s  experience  in  program  lending  in  the  financial  sector  also  offers,  among  others,\n\n81.\nthe following valuable lessons in designing a program:\n\n(i) \n\nA  program  loan  should  focus  on  establishing  the  process  of  reform  rather  than\nquantitative  outcomes  and  single,  static  events  (process  design  over  blueprint;\nbeing clear on where we are going as well as on how to get there).\n\n(ii) \n\nPolicy conditions should be front-loaded rather than back-loaded.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe program should build in flexibility to accommodate a dynamic environment in\nwhich  reforms  must  be  made  (cluster  program  modality,  periodic  review,  and\nrecalibration of targets).\n\n(iv) \n\nIf passage of legislation is critical, then it should be an up-front condition.\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nV. \n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n82.\nA  sound,  efficient,  and  integrated  financial  system  is  fundamental  to  achieve  broad-\nbased,  sustainable  economic  growth,  and  help  meet  the  country\u2019s  social  and  economic\ndevelopment  objectives,  particularly  poverty  reduction.  Numerous  constraints  have  hampered\nfinancial intermediation: (i) uncertainties regarding law and contract enforcement due to lack of\nan  adequate  body  of  laws  and  a  deficient  judicial  system,  (ii)  high  operating  costs  due  to  the\nabsence  of  liquidity  management  mechanism  and  other  market  infrastructure,  (iii)  high\ninformation  costs  due  to  lack  of  common  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  other\ninfrastructure for borrower information, and (iv) weak supervisory system and capacity. A sound\nand  efficient  financial  system  will  give  impetus  to  broad-based  economic  growth  and  poverty\nreduction  by  enlarging  job  opportunities  and  enhancing  the  outreach  of  the  formal  financial\nsector to the poor and rural areas.\n\n83.\nAn  efficient  financial  system  will  be  the  first  step  to  lay  the  foundation  for  the  private\nsector  development.

Thus, a sound and efficient banking system providing credit and\nfinancial service is crucial.\n\nA  sound  and  efficient  financial  system  is  also  essential  for  attracting  foreign  direct\n84.\ninvestment, which has been the pillar of industrial development in Cambodia.

Those countries in Asia with the strongest legal and bank supervisory frameworks had\nstronger  resistance  to  the  negative  impact  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis  than  the  countries  with\nweak legal and bank supervisory frameworks.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n86.\nThe primary goal of the FSPL is to promote the development of a sound, market-based\nfinancial  system  to  support  enhanced  resource  mobilization  and  sustainable  economic  growth\nby establishing the foundation for banking and insurance sectors as well as financial markets.\nThe FSPL will focus on the following activities:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nenhancing  banking  intermediation  and  public  confidence  by  establishing  and\nstrengthening banking supervision, developing key information infrastructure and\nsafety nets, and building capacity in both public and private sectors by reinforcing\ncapacity-building institutions;\n\nestablishing  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  insurance  development  by\ninstituting  a  supervisory  system  and  prudential  regulations,  fostering  private\nsector \ndeveloping\nenforcement/monitoring mechanism for compulsory insurance;\n\ndevelopment \n\ninsurance \n\nbusiness, \n\nand \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nlaying  the  foundation  for  the  development  of  interbank/money  markets  through\npublic-private sector partnership and establishing a basic legal framework; and\n\ndeveloping  financial  market  infrastructure  by  establishing  common  accounting\nstandards  and  enforcement  mechanism  and  promulgating  laws  to  underpin\ncommercial activities and financial markets.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n87.\nThe  FSPL  is  based  on  the  Blueprint  and  ADB\u2019s  previous  assistance  in,  among  others,\ngovernance  reform  (footnote  18)  and  the  development  of  an  accounting  and  auditing  system\n(Narayan  and  Gordon,  footnote  14).  The  policy  reform  package  of  the  FSPL  focuses  on\nstrategic  policy  reforms  identified  in  Phase  I  of  the  Blueprint.  Limited  capacity  and  weak\ngovernance structure in Cambodia  call for flexibility as well as strong leverage in the program\nstructure, to push forward with needed reforms. Thus, the FSPL proposes to adopt a program\ncluster approach with three back-to-back subprograms (Appendix 3).\n\n\f21\n\n1. \n\nBanking Sector Development\n\n88.\nThe FSPL will focus on key policy agenda for banking sector development identified in\nthe Blueprint, which includes, among others, (i) strengthening bank supervision and prudential\nregulations,  (ii)  supporting  bank  restructuring  under  the  IMF  PRGF  program,  (iii)  developing\nbanking sector infrastructure and safety net, and (iv) strengthening capacity-building institutions.\n\na. \n\nStrengthen Bank Supervision and Prudential Regulations\n\n89. While NBC has made substantial progress in establishing basic supervisory framework\nand prudential regulations with IMF assistance, many areas are to be addressed to strengthen\nsupervision  and  prudential  regulations.  First,  old  and  new  prudential  regulations  need  to  be\nreconciled.  Some  old  and  new  regulations  address  the  same  topics.  Some  regulations  do  not\nappear among the new regulations, but language used in the new prudential regulations does\nnot explicitly cancel the old regulations.\n\nSecond,  the  BSD  of  NBC  must  continue  to  strengthen  its  organizational  structure  and\n90.\ncapacity to effectively discharge supervisory responsibilities. BSD has yet to appoint adequate\nstaff in the on-site inspection unit. BSD off-site surveillance staff have begun to be introduced to\non-site inspection procedures with the help of an IMF TA and with the aid of an IMF-prepared\non-site  inspection  handbook.  However,  BSD  needs  to  adopt  comprehensive  formal  inspection\nand  surveillance  procedures  to  guide  its  staff.  BSD  also  needs  to  further  develop  prudential\nregulations to effectively deal with problem banks at an early stage of the problem.\n\nNBC  should  institutionalize  an  anti-money-laundering  policy  to  safeguard  the  banking\n91.\nsystem  against  money  laundering  and  bolster  public  confidence.  While  the  authorities\nrecognized  the  importance  of  safeguarding  the  banking  system  against  criminal  activities  as\nthey included an explicit clause in the Banking Law addressing anti-money-laundering activities,\na regulation against money laundering has not been fully instituted due in part to lack of a sense\nof urgency. It is time for the authorities to adopt regulations against money laundering, such as\nthe  compulsory  reporting  to  NBC  and  other  law  enforcement  authorities  of  suspicious  cash\ntransactions, especially large cash transactions above some minimum threshold.\n\n92.\nTo  address  this  policy  agenda,  the  FSPL  will  support  the  strengthening  of  banking\nsupervision  through  the  following  measures:  (i)  reconciling  old  prudential  regulations  with  new\nregulations  and  issuing  clarifying  guidance  to  commercial  banks,  (ii)  fully  staffing  the  on-site\ninspection  division  of  BSD,  (iii)  adopting  surveillance  and  inspection  procedures  including\nstandardization  of  reports  submitted  by  commercial  banks,  (iv)  adopting  a  prompt  corrective\naction system, and (v) adopting an anti-money-laundering regulation.\n\nPolicy  components  regarding  bank  supervision  addressed  above  are  applied  to  RDB\n93.\nand MFIs with or without minor adaptation (Appendix 3), so that the FSPL will complement the\nRSCP approved in April 2000. RCSP in fact builds in direct linkage with the FSPL in terms of\nsupervision  and  prudential  regulations,  through  which  policy  components  in  the  FSPL  will  be\ndirectly  applied  to  rural  financial  institutions  such  as  RDB  and  MFIs.  Under  RCSP,  RDB  is\nrequired  to  comply  with  an  audit  and  full  compliance  with  recommendations  in  the  audit,  and\nbank regulations and the reporting requirements set by NBC on its financial performance. These\nare  related  to  a  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and  disclosure  rules  and  on-  and  off-site\n\n\f22\n\nsupervision  procedures  under  the  FSPL.  In  addition,  MFIs  are  also  required  to  maintain  full\ncompliance with NBC\u2019s regulations for licensing, circulars, and reporting requirements.20   \n\nb. \n\nSupport Bank Restructuring\n\n94.\nThe  FSPL  will  support  the  completion  of  the  bank  restructuring  program  under  IMF\nPRGF. To complete bank restructuring, the Government needs to address two important areas.\nFirst, the Government needs to expedite liquidation of closed banks and to prepare itself to deal\nwith  conditionally  viable  banks,  that  do  not  meet  the  conditions  specified  in  the  bank\nrestructuring  MOU.  Second,  the  Government  should  exert  systematic  efforts  to  instill\ncommercial orientation in the state-owned FTB that was recently separated from NBC and will\nbe  privatized  by  2001  under  the  IMF  program.  To  facilitate  bank  restructuring,  the  FSPL\nsupports  a  comprehensive  training  program  for  FTB,  including  accounting,  risk  management,\nasset/liability management, and a management information system.\n\nc. \n\nDevelop Banking Sector Infrastructure and Safety Net\n\n95.\nLack of borrowers\u2019 information and uncertainties regarding law and contract enforcement\nhamper  the  banking  operation  and  undermine  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system.  To\nalleviate information asymmetry and uncertainties in the credit markets, the FSPL supports the\ndevelopment of key banking sector infrastructure and safety net in a phased way.\n\n96.\nFirst, the FSPL will assist the Government in developing information infrastructure. Along\nwith  the  adoption  of  common  accounting  standards  consistent  with  IAS/ISA,  the  FSPL  will\nsupport  the  adoption  of  a  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and  disclosure  rules  for  commercial\nbanks, consistent with IAS. The uniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules will lay the\nfoundation of effective banking supervision, and will instill market discipline in bank operations.\nThe  FSPL  will  also  assist  NBC  in  establishing  arrangements  for  sharing  credit  information  in\nclose cooperation with a bankers association. Desirably, the arrangements need to be operated\nby the bankers association under the general guidance of the supervisory authority. Thus, the\nFSPL  will  first  support  the  establishment  of  an  inclusive  bankers  association  with  articles  of\nassociation approved by NBC, and will ensure that the approved articles of association include\na mandate to establish and operate an arrangement for banks sharing of credit information.\n\n97.\nSecond,  the  FSPL  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  secured  transactions  system  to\nenable  the  enforcement  of  secured  interest.  The  FSPL  adopts  a  step-by-step  approach  to\ndevelop the system. It will support the adoption of a secured transactions law and development\nof  a  plan  to  establish  a  public  registry,  and  then  the  establishment  of  the  registry.  While  the\nestablishment  of  a  secured  transactions  system  will  be  an  important  step  to  facilitate  banking\noperation,  the  system  will  not  function  fully  unless  the  public  gains  confidence  in  the  judicial\nsystem and law enforcement. Thus, the Government should push forward with the governance\nreforms envisaged in the Governance Action Plan.\n\n98.\nThird,  along  with  the  establishment  of  basic  infrastructure,  the  FSPL  will  initiate  the\ndevelopment of a banking sector safety net to bolster public confidence in the banking system.\nThe  bank  relicensing  program  aims  at  enhancing  the  soundness  of  the  banking  system  by\nfacilitating  the  exit  of  nonviable  banks,  and  thus  eventually  boosts  public  confidence  in  the\nsystem.  However,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  depositor  confidence  in  the  banking  system  has\n\n20 Loan 1741-CAM: Rural Credit and Savings Project, for $20 million, approved on 20 April 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f23\n\nsuffered due to bank closures and delays in the liquidation process. Thus, after the relicensing\nprogram  is  completed,  with  appropriate  recapitalization  and  restructuring,  the  Government\nshould  consider  introducing  a  small-depositor  protection  system.  To  support  the  authorities\u2019\neffort,  the  FSPL  includes  developing  a  plan  to  establish  a  deposit  insurance  system  to\nsafeguard small depositors of commercial banks.\n\n99. Weak  contract  enforcement  and  uncertainties  have  been  major  impediments  to  the\ndevelopment  of  rural  finance.  Strengthening  contract  enforcement  by  developing  a  secured\ntransactions system will facilitate rural finance. The FSPL also explicitly supports the application\nof  a  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and  disclosure  rules  (based  on  IAS)  to  RDB,  other\nspecialized banks, and licensed MFIs. Considering the limited capacity of MFIs compared with\ncommercial  banks,  the  FSPL  envisages  the  application  of  a  uniform  chart  of  accounts  and\ndisclosure rules to RDB, other specialized banks, and MFIs under Subprogram III (Appendix 3).\n\nd. \n\nStrengthen Capacity-Building Institutions\n\nThe FSPL will support the strengthening of the existing capacity-building institutions as\n100.\nwell as the establishment of new institutions. It will first target strengthening the existing CBS by\nseparating it from NBC and establishing it as a subsidiary of NBC with separate management\nand  accounts.  An  independent  CBS  will  not  only  facilitate  hiring  full-time  instructors  and\ncompetent  managers  with  a  competitive  salary  scheme  different  from  that  of  NBC;  it  will  also\npromote mobilization of external assistance with sound financial management. CBS can then be\ndeveloped into a prime training institution for the central bank and other government agencies.\nTo support the process, the FSPL will assist CBS to establish a central banking course for NBC\nprofessional staff and a mandatory course for professional staff at entry level.\n\n101.\nThe  FSPL  will  also  support  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  banking  institute  for\nprivate  bank  staff  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  professional  training  in  the  commercial\nbanking sector and ensure that the approved articles of association of the bankers association\ninclude a mandate to promote education, research, and training in all aspects of banking. The\nbanking institute, together with CBS, will undertake formal training in core skills (e.g., banking,\naccounting, statistical analysis, and general management), as well as specialized competencies\nnecessary  for  the  effective  operation  of  financial  institutions  in  a  market-based  economy.  The\nbanking institute should be open to staff of MFIs, so that it can accommodate training demands\nfor rural finance (Appendix 3).\n\n2. \n\nInsurance Sector Development\n\n102.\nTo  support  the  implementation  of  the  policy  reform  agenda  identified  in  the  Blueprint,\nthe  FSPL  will  focus  on  the  following  strategic  areas:  (i)  establishing  and  strengthening  a\nsupervisory/regulatory  framework,  (ii)  establishing  an  enforcement  mechanism  for  compulsory\ninsurance, and (iii) promoting private sector development.\n\na. \n\nEstablish and Strengthen Supervisory/Regulatory Framework\n\n103. As the first step toward the development of the insurance sector, the FSPL will support\nthe  establishment  of  supervisory  and  regulatory  system  in  a  phased  manner:  (i)  establish  an\ninsurance supervisory unit under MEF, (ii) adopt a subdecree to implement the new Insurance\nLaw, and (iii) adopt a regulation to apply IAS/ISA to the insurance sector.\n\n\f24\n\nb. \n\nEstablish an Enforcement Mechanism for Compulsory Insurance\n\n104.\nThe  Government  introduced  compulsory  insurance  in  the  new  Insurance  Law  in  July\n2000,  and  committed  itself  to  develop  compulsory  insurance  on  par  with  that  in  member\ncountries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. Implementing compulsory insurance,\nhowever,  calls  for  an  effective  enforcement  and  monitoring  mechanism  that  involves  related\ngovernment  agencies,  as  well  as  supporting  laws  and  regulations.  To  organize  the  efforts  of\nmultiple \nthe\nGovernment  should  first  adopt  an  official  working  plan  for  the  development  of  a  compulsory\ninsurance system by creating an interministerial working group. The plan should include, among\nothers,  a  timetable  for  adopting  supporting  laws  and  organizational  structure,  and  division  of\nresponsibilities in enforcement and monitoring.\n\nthe  establishment  of  an  enforcement  mechanism, \n\nline  ministries \n\ntoward \n\nc. \n\nPromote Private Sector Development\n\n105. Given  the  underdeveloped  insurance  markets  and  the  weak  basis  for  private  sector\ndevelopment,  insurance  sector  development  hinges  on  increased  participation  of  the  private\nsector insurance companies and a competitive market environment. In particular, the success of\nthe newly introduced compulsory insurance critically depends on the active marketing role of the\nprivate  insurance  companies  who  are  suppliers  of  insurance  policy.  As  the  first  step  to  foster\nprivate  sector  development,  the  FSPL  will  support  a  joint  venture  between  the  state-owned\nCAMINCO and a private company, a plan to divest the Government\u2019s share in the joint venture\nto avoid conflict of interests, and the establishment of a transparent entry mechanism. The joint\nventure  will  instill  commercial  orientation  into  the  state-owned  company  and  thus  expedite  the\ndevelopment of insurance products.\n\n3. \n\nDevelopment of Interbank/Money Markets\n\n106. Development  of  interbank/money  markets  is  critical  to  reduce  the  operating  costs  of\nbanks  and  other  financial  institutions  in  Cambodia.  To  develop  interbank/money  markets,  the\nFSPL  focuses  on  two  reforms:  creating  self-regulated  interbank  market  arrangements,  and\nestablishing a legal and regulatory framework for money markets.\n\na. \n\nCreate Interbank Markets\n\n107.\nThe  first  step  in  establishing  interbank  markets  should  be  initiated  by  the  commercial\nbanks under the guidance of NBC. With the establishment of an inclusive bankers association,\nacting  on  behalf  of  all  bank  members,  the  association  must  play  a  catalytic  role  in  forming\ninterbank markets. Interbank market arrangements should be self-regulated by banks under the\ngeneral  guideline  of  NBC.  The  first  interbank  service  can  be  short-term,  unsecured  interbank\nlending (overnight call loan and money). The FSPL supports (i) the establishment of an inclusive\nbankers association with the mandate of establishing interbank market arrangements included\nin the articles of association, which will be subject to NBC\u2019s approval; and (ii) the creation of a\nworking  group,  consisting  of  representatives  from  NBC  and  the  bankers  association,  when\nformed, that undertakes the task of establishing interbank market arrangements.\n\nb. \n\nEstablish a Legal and Regulatory Framework for Money Markets\n\nThe  FSPL  supports  the  development  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  money\n108.\nmarkets. The first task is to adopt a comprehensive negotiable instruments law that includes all\ntypes  of  instruments  \u2013  from  simple  payment  instruments  to  credit  instruments.  Second,  NBC\n\n\f25\n\nshould  set  up  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  interbank  market  activities.  The  framework\nshould focus on the role of a central bank as a supervisor and monitor of the liquidity positions\nof  the  banks  as  well  as  the  overall  decision-making  authority  for  monetary  policy.  Third,  NBC\nshould  provide  detailed  procedures  for  issuing  interbank/money  market  instruments.  Among\nthese tasks, the FSPL supports the adoption of a negotiable instruments law as the legal basis\nfor the money market instruments.\n\n109. Key  impediments  facing  MFIs  include  heavy  dependence  on  Government  and  funding\nagency assistance for resources, and high transaction and operating costs. The development of\ninterbank/money  markets  is  expected  to  lessen  these  impediments.  The  emergence  of\ninterbank  markets  will  provide  a  mechanism  by  which  RDB  and  MFIs  can  manage  short-term\nliquidity and thus reduce their operating costs. Furthermore, the interbank markets will facilitate\nthe integration of RDB and MFIs into the whole banking system and provide a channel through\nwhich financial resources in urban and rural areas can be pooled and allocated by a common\nmarket mechanism. Thus, the development of and the participation of RDB and licensed MFIs in\ninterbank  markets  will  enhance  the  outreach  of  the  financial  system  into  the  rural  areas.\nAvailability of interbank markets will also partly relieve difficulties regarding funding uncertainties\nstemming from intermittent financing from funding agencies.\n\n4. \n\nDevelopment of Accounting and Legal Infrastructure\n\na. \n\nEstablish an of Accounting and Auditing System\n\n110. Establishing  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  their  enforcement  system  is  an\nessential thrust of the FSPL. The Government has already committed itself to adopt IAS/ISA in\ntheir entirety. However, given its limited capacity, the Government will phase in IAS/ISA starting\nwith  15  standards  of  IAS  and  10  standards  of  ISA.  The  FSPL  will  support  the  Government\u2019s\nefforts  in  the  following  key  areas:  (i)  promulgating  of  an  accounting  and  auditing  law;  (ii)\nadopting  of  a  subdecree  to  apply  IAS/ISA  to  all  companies  incorporated  in  Cambodia;  (iii)\nestablishing  a  national  accounting  council,  which  will  be  in  charge  of  setting  and  interpreting\nstandards;  (iv)  adopting  IAS  and  ISA;  (v)  establishing  an  association  of  accountants  and\nauditors; (vi) adopting a code of ethics that complies with the requirements of the International\nFederation of Accountants; and (vii) establishing committees on education and ethics within the\nassociation.\n\nb. \n\nDevelop Legal Infrastructure\n\n111.\nTo facilitate financial sector development, the Government is expected to complete key\nlegislation  such  as  a  civil  code,  law  on  commercial  enterprises,  bankruptcy  law,  secured\ntransactions  law,  commercial  arbitration  procedure,  etc.  It  is  also  expected  to  initiate\ncomprehensive  judicial  reforms,  supported  by  ADB  and  World  Bank,  to  strengthen  law\nenforcement. In this reform agenda, the FSPL will specifically support the adoption of the law on\ncommercial enterprises.\n\nc. \n\nEstablish a Regulatory Framework for Corporate Financing\nActivities\n\n112.\nIn line with the adoption of a law on commercial enterprises, the Government needs to\nestablish  a  basic  law  governing  corporate  financing,  or  the  securities  and  exchange  law.  A\nsecurities  supervisory  authority  is  necessary  in  implementing  the  forthcoming  law  on\ncommercial  enterprises  and  accounting  and  auditing  law,  as  the  two  laws  envisage  the\n\n\f26\n\nsecurities supervisory authority (whether the MEF or an independent regulator) will be the main\nregulatory  body  to  implement  the  laws.  The  securities  and  exchange  law  will  provide  a  legal\nbasis  for  securities  supervisory  authorities.  Second,  once  the  Government  puts  in  place  a  law\non  commercial  enterprises,  nonexchange-based,  grassroot  capital  market  transactions  will\noccur due to companies\u2019 financing activities. Shares of certain good firms will be traded. Equity\nparticipation  of  foreign  investors  will  increase.  Certain  good  firms  may  also  issue  debt\ninstruments. This implies that even before the Government establishes exchange-based capital\nmarkets, it would need a legal basis to regulate securities transactions over the counter and to\nprotect investors and traders \u2013 in particular, foreign direct investors.\n\nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n113.  The FSPL is expected to have an impact on facilitating resource mobilization through the\nbanking  and  insurance  system  and  capital  markets.  It  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  resource\nallocation, thereby facilitating economic growth and job creation and benefiting all elements of\nsociety including the poor and near poor. Appendix 4 presents the poverty impact assessment\nfor the FSPL. By developing the banking system and capital markets, the FSPL is expected to\nhave  a  beneficial  impact  on  growth  and  employment  by  reducing  intermediation  costs  and,  in\nturn, reducing the cost of capital for businesses. It will also encourage direct private participation\nin economic activities. The development of interbank markets will facilitate the use of monetary\ninstruments and improve the liquidity management of banks. The improved performance of the\ninsurance system will enhance savings and the availability of productive resources to enhance\ninvestments.\n\n114.  The FSPL is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s environmental classification system.\nIts environmental impact is expected to be minimal. It addresses the development of a legal and\nregulatory  system  and  market  infrastructure  to  lay  the  foundation  for  broad-based  economic\ngrowth.  Most  of  the  policy  components  are  concerned  with  such  things  as  developing  a\nsupervisory  and  regulatory  framework,  basic  market  infrastructure,  and  capacity-building\nmechanisms, but does not include investment projects.\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\n115.\nThe  FSPL  adopts  a  program  cluster  approach  with  three  back-to-back  subprograms\ntotaling $30 million. The program cluster approach will not only allow flexibility, but also provide\nsafeguard against inherent risks perceived in Cambodia (paras. 141-146) and strong leverage\nto push forward with needed reforms.\n\n116. Each subprogram loan will be for $10 million and will be processed sequentially upon the\ncompletion of the previous subprogram (Appendix 3). The program cluster is front-loaded, with\nthe  first  two  subprograms  carrying  the  most  weighty  policy  reforms.  Subprogram  I  has  two\ntranches and will be completed within 12 months after loan effectiveness. Subprogram II will be\nfor  Board  consideration  and  approval  based  on  progress  in  implementing\npresented \nSubprogram  I,  the  status  of  proposed  policy  reform  actions,  and  the  readiness  of  the\nGovernment to undertake the proposed reforms. The conditions for Subprogram II are expected\nto be implemented within 12 months after the effectiveness of the loan agreement. However, the\nGovernment  is  encouraged  to  undertake  policy  conditions  specified  in  Subprogram  II  up-front,\neven  before  the  loan  effectiveness  of  Subprogram  II,  whenever  feasible.  Thus,  before\npresenting the Subprogram II loan agreement for approval, ADB will further refine the proposed\n\n\f27\n\npolicy  reform  actions  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  achievements  and  changing  policy\nenvironment.  Subprogram  III  will  be  processed  in  a  similar  manner.  The  conditions  for\nSubprogram III are expected to be implemented within 12 months after the effectiveness of the\nloan agreement for Subprogram III.\n\n117.\nThe processing and financial implication of the program cluster are the same as in the\ntraditional single program to the Government because the approval of subsequent programs is\nintegrated  into  the  loan  review  process  of  the  previous  programs,  except  that  the  structure\nrequires  a  separate  loan  agreement  for  each  subprogram.  The  Government  welcomed  and\nstrongly supported the subprogram cluster approach.\n\n118.\nThe total loan amount for the FSPL and individual loan amounts for the subprograms are\ndetermined  on  the  basis  of  the  strategic  significance  of  financial  sector  development  and  the\ncosts  of  structural  reforms  under  the  FSPL.  The  pecuniary  components  of  the  latter  are\nestimated at $80 million-$90 million equivalent, as shown in the table.\n\nEstimated Adjustment Costs for Key Policy Reforms of the FSPL\n($ million equivalent)\n\nItem\n\nEstimated Cost\n\nAdopting  and  enforcing  the  International  Accounting  Standards  and\n\nInternational Standards on Auditing\n\nEstablishing banking sector infrastructure and safety net including public\ninformation  exchange\n\nregistry  of  secured \ntransactions,  credit \narrangement, and deposit insurance system\n\nStrengthening bank prudential regulations and bank restructuring\nDeveloping  interbank  and  money  markets  and  laying  the  foundation  for\n\ncapital market development\n\nDeveloping capacity-building institutions in both private and public sectors\nDeveloping a legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector\n\nTotal\n\n37\n\n18\n\n16\n6\n\n7\n6\n90\n\n119. Given  Cambodia\u2019s  situation  with  a  shortage  of  human  and  social  capital,  the  policy\nchanges  envisaged  in  the  FSPL  involve  three  types  of  adjustment  cost  components,  both\npecuniary  and  nonpecuniary.  The  first  kind  is  the  cost  to  the  private  and  public  sectors  of\ncompliance  with  the  new  legal  and  regulatory  systems  and  standards  that  the  FSPL  will\nintroduce.  As  described  in  the  previous  section,  the  FSPL  supports  the  introduction  of  many\nnew  laws,  as  well  as  regulations  and  standards  such  as  accounting  and  auditing  standards,\nuniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules, new prudential regulations, on- and off-site\nsupervision  procedures,  a  prompt  corrective  action  system,  an  anti-money-laundering\nregulation,  and  compulsory  insurance.  The  compliance  costs  are  incurred  partly  because  the\npreviously  unregulated  areas  of  financial  and  commercial  activities  are  now  subject  to\nregulations  and  standards,  and  partly  because  the  old  regulations  and  standards  must  be\nreplaced  with  new  ones.  The  compliance  costs  can  be  pecuniary  and  nonpecuniary.  While\nnonpecuniary  costs  and  some  pecuniary  costs  are  substantial,  it  would  be  difficult  to  estimate\nthem because the absence of relevant markets makes the key cost components unavailable.\n\nThe second type of adjustment costs will be the capacity-building cost. Given the limited\n120.\nhuman  and  social  capital  in  Cambodia,  almost  all  sectors  need  substantial  capacity  building.\nThe  capacity-building  costs  will  be  incurred  in  the  early  stage  of  program  implementation  and\n\n\f28\n\nthus  precede  the  compliance  costs.  The  pecuniary  components  of  capacity-building  costs\ninclude,  for  instance,  costs  for  training  managerial  and  working-level  staff  in  both  private  and\npublic sectors or hiring skilled staff or experts.\n\nThe  third  type  relates  to  the  enforcement  costs  for  the  authorities  and  self-regulated\n121.\norganizations,  which  mirrors  the  compliance  cost  for  the  regulated  parties.  The  enforcement\ncosts  include  mostly  institution  building,  which  has  direct  budget  implications  as  well  as\nnonpecuniary  cost  implications.  Examples  include  the  establishment  of  an  on-site  inspection\nunit,  insurance  supervisory  unit,  bankers  association,  bank  training  institutions  in  both  private\nand public sectors, interbank market arrangements, arrangements for sharing credit information,\npublic  registry  for  secured  transactions,  and  deposit  insurance  system.  Like  the  capacity-\nbuilding cost components, the enforcement cost components tend to occur at the early stage of\nprogram  implementation,  as  the  authorities  need  to  start  substantial  preparatory  works  before\nimplementation.\n\n122. Given the nature of the adjustment cost components, the time profile of those costs for\nthe FSPL generally corresponds to that of the implementation of the three subprograms. Since\nthe  FSPL  aims  at  process-oriented  financial  sector  development  and  the  impact  of  policy\nchanges  under  the  FSPL  extends  into  medium-  to  long-term  periods,  the  compliance  cost\ncomponents  are  spread  over  the  time  after  program  implementation,  although  some  cost\ncomponents  will  be  incurred  at  the  time  of  policy  changes.  Moreover,  the  program  cluster  is\ndesigned  to  introduce  policy  changes  commensurate  with  the  gradual  building  up  of  capacity\nand  enforcement  mechanisms  to  ensure  smooth  implementation,  and  each  subprogram  is\ndesigned  in  such  way  that  the  preceding  subprogram  serves  as  a  preparatory  stage  for  or  to\nprovide inputs for the following subprogram. Thus, the capacity-building and enforcement cost\ncomponents  tend  to  be  incurred  before  or  at  the  time  of  policy  actions  of  each  subprogram.\nConsidering  the  different  time  profiles  of  the  three  cost  components,  the  combined  weight  of\nindividual policy action in terms of adjustment costs will follow an increasing pattern over time\nwhen  each  subprogram  is  implemented  sequentially.  To  balance  the  overall  weights  of\nadjustment  costs  across  subprograms,  the  policy  conditions  in  the  whole  program  cluster  are\nfront-loaded, as the first and second subprograms carry most of the difficult policy conditions.\n\nB. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n123.\nFor  the  loan  under  Subprogram  I  of  FSPL,  the  Borrower  will  be  the  Kingdom  of\nCambodia,  and  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24\nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  will  carry  an  interest  rate  of  1.0  percent  per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\n124.\nThe loan will be utilized within 18 months from the date of loan effectiveness. The loan\nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  incurred  within  180  days  before  the  date  of\neffectiveness.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\n125. NBC will be the Executing Agency for the FSPL, and will have overall responsibility for\nprogram implementation, including administering and preparing semiannual progress reports on\nprogram  implementation.  Implementing  agencies  will  be  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  the  bankers\nassociation when formed.\n\n\f29\n\n2. \n\nSteering Committee\n\nfinancial  sector  steering  committee  (FSSC)  will  be  established \n\n126. A \nto  oversee\nimplementation.  The  FSSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  governor  of  NBC  and  will  include  senior\nrepresentatives  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  the  Council  for  the  Development  of  Cambodia\n(CDC).  The  FSCC  will  meet  at  least  once  every  three  months  to  ensure  that  the  proposed\nreforms are undertaken in accordance with the agreed-upon timetable, all as set forth in the list\nof  actions  to  be  taken  during  the  FSPL.  A  working  group  will  also  be  established  under  the\nFSSC  to  assist  in  and  oversee  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The  working  group  will\nconsist  of  representatives  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  CDC,  and  will  be  joined  by  a\nrepresentative of the bankers association when this is formed and recognized by NBC. Another\nworking  group,  called  the  interbank  markets  working  group,  comprising  representatives  from\nNBC  and  the  bankers  association  will  also  be  established  to  facilitate  the  establishment  of\ninterbank markets, a banking institute, and arrangements for sharing credit information among\nthe members of the bankers association.\n\nD. \n\nProcurement\n\n127.\nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for\nprogram loans,21 goods and services produced in and originating in ADB member countries will\nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard\npublic  sector  procedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices,\nacceptable  to  ADB.  In  the  case  of  goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity\nmarkets,  they  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  procedures  appropriate  to  the  trade  and\nacceptable to ADB.\n\nE. \n\nDisbursement\n\n128.\nThe  proceeds  of  the  FSPL  will  be  disbursed  for  a  broad  range  of  imports,  subject  to  a\nnegative list of ineligible items (Appendix 5). Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of a\ncertification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which FSPL proceeds are\nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i) imports  from  nonmember\ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development\nassistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  the  year.\nThe Government will open an account (the deposit account) at NBC into which the proceeds of\nthe loans will be deposited and from which all withdrawals will be made. Monthly statements of\nthe deposit account will be attached to the semiannual report of the FSPL.\n\nF. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n129.\nThe policy framework for the FSPL includes specific components that bear distinct costs\nof structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be\nused  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  under  the  FSPL.  Any  counterpart  funds  not\nrequired will be used for general development purposes.\n\n21 R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 16 April 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f30\n\nG.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n1. \n\nSubprogram I\n\nThe  loan  for  Subprogram  I  is  to  be  released  in  two  tranches:  (i)  $5  million  upon  loan\n130.\neffectiveness, and (ii) $5 million within 12 months subject to the fulfillment of specified second\ntranche  release  conditions.

Policy actions for Subprogram II are subject to revision and\nrefinement following ADB\u2019s reassessment of the macroeconomic environment, lessons learned\nin  Subprogram  I,  and  the  status  of  implementation  and  readiness  of  the  Government  to\nundertake the proposed policy reform actions in connection with related reforms specified in the\nBlueprint. The conditions for Subprogram II are envisaged to be implemented within 12 months\nof  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement  for  Subprogram  II.

Among  the  conditions,  (i)  and  (ii)  will  be  included  as  the  Board  consideration  of\nconditions for Subprogram II.\n\n3. \n\nSubprogram III\n\n135.\nThe  proposed  loan  for  Subprogram  III  of  the  FSPL  will  be  $10  million  from  ADF.\nTranching and the revision of policy conditions for Subprogram III will be determined as they are\nfor  Subprogram  II.  The  conditions  for  Subprogram  III  are  envisaged  to  be  implemented  in  12\nmonths  after  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement  for  Subprogram  III.  The  Proposed\nconditions for Subprogram III are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\nNBC  to  apply  the  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and  disclosure  rules  for  the\ncommercial  banks  consistent  with  IAS  to  RDB,  other  specialized  banks,  and\nlicensed MFIs.\n\nNBC  to  adopt  a  plan  to  establish  a  deposit  insurance  system  for  commercial\nbanks.\n\n(iii) \n\nAdoption of a secured transactions law.\n\n(iv)  MOC to establish a public registry for secured transactions.\n\nNBC  to  ensure  that  the  bankers  association  establish  a  banking  institute  for\nprivate bank staff under the bankers association, pursuant to its approved articles\nof association, and establish a professional training course for private bank staff.\nThe banking institute should be open to staff of MFIs.\n\n(vi)  MEF  to  adopt  a  plan  to  divest  MEF\u2019s  share  in  the  joint-venture  insurance\n\ncompany.\n\n(vii) \n\nAdoption of a negotiable instruments law.\n\n(viii)  Adoption of a securities and exchange law.\n\n(ix)  MEF to establish an association of accountants and auditors, to adopt a code of\nethics  that  complies  with  the  requirements  of  the  International  Federation  of\nAccountants,  and  to  establish  committees  on  education  and  ethics  within  the\nassociation.\n\n136. Among the conditions, (iii), (vii), and (viii) will be included as the Board consideration of\nconditions for Subprogram III.\n\n\f33\n\n4. \n\nMonitoring\n\n137. ADB, in cooperation with NBC, MEF, MOC, and CDC, will carry out semiannual reviews\nof  progress  in  program  implementation,  and  will  assess  the  program\u2019s  impact  on  the  financial\nand other sectors of the economy. The Government and ADB will continue to engage in active\npolicy  dialogue  throughout  FSPL  implementation  on  issues  that  may  affect  financial  sector\ndevelopment  and  additional  reforms  that  may  be  necessary  or  desirable  for  the  sustainable\ndevelopment  of  the  financial  sector  (which  may  result  in  the  revision  of  the  Blueprint).  The\nGovernment will keep ADB informed of outcomes of the policy discussions with the IMF and the\nWorld  Bank  Group  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding  agencies  that  have  implications\nfor FSPL implementation.\n\nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  reports  on  FSPL  implementation,\n138.\nparticularly on policy actions set out in the policy matrix, the development policy letter, and the\nBlueprint,  as  well  as  on  the  accomplishment  of  the  FSPL  objectives.  In  case  the  Government\nupdates  or  revises  the  Blueprint,  the  semiannual  reports  will  also  include  the  rationale  and\ncontents of such revisions. Semiannual reports will be submitted in such form and in such detail\nand within such period as ADB may request, and will include (i) progress made and problems\nencountered  during  the  six  months  under  review,  (ii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to\nremedy  the  problems  encountered,  and  (iii)  the  proposed  detailed  activity  for  FSPL\nimplementation and expected progress during the next six months. On completion of the FSPL,\nbut  in  any  event  not  later  than  six  months,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a\ncomprehensive  report  on  the  overall  impact  of  the  policy  reforms  implemented.  Monitoring\nindicators and mechanisms are given in the program framework (Appendix 6).\n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nBenefits\n\n139. Cambodia\u2019s  underdeveloped \nthe  most  significant\nfinancial  system \nconstraint  to  broad-based  economic  growth  and  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  socioeconomic\ndevelopment  objectives,  particularly,  poverty  reduction.  The  beneficial  impacts  on  poverty\nassociated with the FSPL can be summarized as follows:\n\nis  potentially \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStrengthening the prudential and supervisory framework for commercial banks is\nexpected to promote the development of a sound and viable banking system and\nimprove access of the more vulnerable and poorer segments of the population to\nfinancial service;\n\nStrengthening  the  banking  system  will  render  banks  more  resilient  and\ninvulnerable  to  disruptions  to  the  banking  system  from  external  shocks,  which\nundermine  growth  prospects,  wipe  out  savings,  and  lead  to  significant  fiscal\nrestructuring costs; and\n\nA  consolidated,  restructured,  and  well-regulated  banking  system  will  (a)  on  the\nexpenditure side, free up public sector resources to invest in productive activities\nsuch  as  infrastructure  or  social  sectors  (i.e.,  health  and  education),  which  may\notherwise have been reallocated to bank restructuring or recapitalization; and (b)\non the revenue side, relax credit constraints and strengthen credit to the private\nsector, expanding GDP growth and with it, the taxable revenue base to meet the\n\n\f34\n\nsocial safety net and other social expenditure needs to minimize the vulnerability\nof the poor segment of the population.\n\n140.\nThe  financial  sector  reforms  under  the  FSPL  are  necessary  to  ensure  a  stable,  viable,\nand competitive financial system based on improved asset quality in the banking system, and a\nmore  efficient  banking  intermediation  process.  Development  of  the  insurance  sector  and\ninterbank markets will create an enabling environment necessary to ensure domestic resource\nmobilization  including  long-term  sources  of  investment  funds  to  complement  the  lending\nchannels intermediated through the banking system. The reforms under the FSPL are expected\nto have a positive impact on savings and investment in the economy.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n141.\nThe principal risk lies in unexpected political disturbance. The country has been enjoying\na very high level of political unity and stability, and the comprehensive reform programs in place\nshould  lead  to  significant  progress  in  economic  growth.  However,  Cambodia  will  go  into  a\npolitical  season  up  to  early  2002,  as  the  National  Assembly  and  the  Senate  of  Cambodia\npassed  the  Commune  Election  and  Commune  Administration  Laws  in  January  and  February\n2001,  respectively.22  At  the  moment,  the  commune  elections  could  take  place  as  early  as\nJanuary 2002 after final approval of the law by the Constitutional Council and the King, giving\nthe National Election Committee less than a year to prepare for a major undertaking involving\npotentially thousands of candidates.\n\n142.\nThere  may  be  risks  associated  with  weak  capacity  at  the  institution  level,  the  ability  to\nrecruit  and  retain  qualified  cadres  and  staff,  and  poor  coordination  between  policy-making\nagencies. While risks associated with weak capacity are typical in policy reform programs, those\nfactors need special attention in designing a program loan in Cambodia.\n\n143. Another  risk  may  be  related  to  \u201claw  fatigue.\u201d  Given  the  deficient  legal  environment  in\nCambodia,  the  Government  has  been  expediting  a  substantial  volume  of  legislation  in  a\nrelatively short period. However, there have been some cases where adopted laws are not fully\nimplemented,  despite  all  the  efforts  of  the  Government  and  aid  agencies.  This  stems  in  part\nfrom lack of consultation with stakeholders including the private sector and aid agencies and in\npart from weak institutional capacity.\n\n144.\nThe  FSPL  includes  safeguards  in  the  design  of  the  overall  framework  of  assistance.\nFirst, the FSPL adopts the program cluster approach, with three back-to-back subprograms that\ncontain doable sets of policy reforms in a relatively short period (e.g., one year). The program\ncluster approach introduces flexibility to accommodate various types of risks by allowing further\nrefinement  of  policy  conditions  reflecting  changing  environments,  while  pursuing  the  original\nobjectives of the program cluster concept, approved by the Board.\n\n145.\nThe FSPL will also be supported by an ADTA to reduce the downside risks from weak\ncapacity.  An  ADTA  will  be  processed  to  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  policy  reform\nmeasures.23\n\n                  \n\n22 National  elections  are  likely  to  be  held  in  2003,  thereby  potentially  prolonging  the  upcoming  period  of  political\n\ninstability.\n\n23 A capacity-building TA had been in the pipeline for 2001 and was supposed to be piggybacked to this program, but\nit  was  rescheduled  to  2002  due  to  the  scaling  down  of  the  TA  budget  early  in  2001.  However,  on  July  31,  the\nFrench Government confirmed its funding for an ADTA for capacity building in banking and financial management.\n\n\f35\n\n146. Risks associated with \u201claw fatigue\u201d can be minimized by instituting procedures for broad\nand  regular  consultation  with  the  private  sector  stakeholders.  In  this  regard,  the  Government\nhas  already  made  substantial  progress.  On  25  January  2001,  the  Government  adopted  the\nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  on  the  Formation  of  a  Sectoral  Working  Group  for  Consultation\nPartnership  with  the  Private  Sector,  which  mandated  the  creation  of  procedures  for  private\nsector  consultation  in  seven  major  areas  including  banking  and  financial  service.  While  it  is\nunderstood that the procedure can also be utilized as a private sector consultation procedure for\nlegislation,  the  FSPL  explicitly  supports  the  adoption  of  a  formal  consultation  procedure  for\nlegislation with the banking sector as one of the policy conditions of Subprogram I (Appendix 3).\n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n147.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement,\nas  described  in  the  development  policy  letter,  will  continue  in  effect  for  the\nduration of the FSPL period.\n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  the  policy  actions  included  in  the  development\npolicy letter and the Loan Agreement, and ensure that such policies and actions\ncontinue in effect for the duration of the program period.\n\nThe  Government  will  regularly  update  and  refine  the  Financial  Sector  Blueprint\nbased  on  its  achievements  and  will  consult  with  ADB  with  respect  to  the\nrefinements through regular policy dialogue.\n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n\n148.\nADB and recommend that the Board approve\n\nthe program cluster concept of $30,000,000 for the Financial Sector Program to\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia; and\n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 7,758,000 to\nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Subprogram  I  of  the  Financial  Sector  Program,\nwith a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest\ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and

October 2001\n\nH.E. Mr. Tadao Chino\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nSubject:\n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER\nLong-Term  Financial  Sector  Development  Plan  and  Program  Loan  Cluster\nfor Financial Sector Development Program\n\nThis letter refers to the request of the Royal Government of Cambodia (the Government)\n1.\nfor  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  support  of  policy  reform  efforts\nunder the proposed Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP). As its strong commitment\nto  undertakings  envisaged  in  FSDP,  the  Government  is  pleased  to  inform  ADB  that  it  has\nformally  adopted  the  Financial  Sector  Blueprint  for  2001-2010  (the  Blueprint)  prepared  under\nADB's  recently  completed  technical  assistance  (TA3467-CAM:  Preparing  for  the  Financial\nSector  Development  Program)  as  the  Government's  official  financial  sector  development  plan.\nThis  letter  spells  out  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  and  strategy  for  financial  sector\ndevelopment  and  key  elements  of  the  Blueprint,  as  well  as  objectives,  scope,  and  main\nelements of the FSDP.\n\nI. \n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT ISSUES\n\nCambodia\u2019s \n\nfinancial  sector \n\n2.\nfinancial\nintermediation  and  low  public  confidence.  Cambodia  has  one  of  the  lowest  rates  of  banking\nintermediation in the world: bank loans and deposits account for approximately 8 percent and 12\npercent of GDP, respectively.\n\nis  at  a  rudimentary  stage,  with \n\nlimited \n\n3.\nCurrently Cambodia has 20 commercial banks after National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)'s\nre-licensing  program  in  2000,  which  revoked  the  licenses  of  eleven  non-viable  banks.  Other\nfinancial  institutions  operating  in  Cambodia  include  insurance  companies,  currency  exchange\nbureaus, and microfinance institutions. In the rural area, banking activities are even scarcer, and\nmicrofinance  operations  of  NGOs  are  the  major  providers  of  credit.  There  are  no  recognized\ninterbank/money markets and capital markets in Cambodia.\n\n4.\nA number of factors contribute to the low level of intermediation, poor asset quality, and\nhigh  operating  costs  for  financial  institutions.  All  these  factors  hamper  public  confidence  and\nhinder  deposit  mobilization,  as  the  majority  of  money  in  the  economy  is  held  outside  of  the\nfinancial system.\n\nPage 1 of 10\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nWeak  financial  infrastructure  hampers  the  development  of  financial  sector.  Cambodia\n5.\nhas yet to develop or strengthen laws pertaining to accounting, negotiable instruments, secured\ntransactions,  commercial  enterprises,  bankruptcy,  contracts  and  commercial  credit,  etc.  In\naddition,  the  public  confidence  in  the  judicial  system  is  very  low.  Lack  of  the  rule  of  law  has\nhampered  the  development  of  contract-based  credit  culture  and  thus  one  of  the  primary\nimpediments to the private sector development. Moreover, Cambodia has yet to adopt common\naccounting/audit  standards.  Not  many  companies  produce  audited  financial  statements,  and\ncompanies produce financial statements using different standards. Lack of common accounting\nstandards and enforcement has not only increased the risk and cost of banking operations, but\nalso deters the development of capital markets.\n\n6.\nLack of financial information infrastructure impedes bank lending and leads to poor asset\nquality. Bankers are unable to lend based on cash-flow analysis due to lack of clients\u2019 financial\ninformation. As a result, they are compelled to lend against collateral as the primary source of\nrepayment,  which  is  further  compromised  by  a  lack  of  infrastructure  for  secured  transactions.\nFurthermore,  Cambodia  lacks  a  credit  bureau  or  other  arrangements,  by  which  credit\ninformation that can be accessed and shared by the members of the Bankers Association.\n\n7.\nLack  of  liquidity  management  mechanisms  incurs  opportunity  costs  to  banks.  The\nbanking sector maintains abnormally high levels of liquidity due to the lack of interbank markets\nto  effectively  manage  liquidity.  Furthermore,  NBC  is  unable  to  provide  liquidity  to  commercial\nbanks  to  meet  temporary  liquidity  shortages.  Although  the  Law  on  the  Organization  and\nConduct of the National Bank of Cambodia provides the legal basis for rediscount facilities, all\neligible  negotiable  instruments  such  as  bills  of  exchange,  promissory  notes,  etc.,  are  not\navailable  due  to  the  lack  of  a  Negotiable  Instruments  Law  and  other  necessary  legal\ninfrastructure.\n\n8.\nWeak  supervisory  capacity  and  regulatory  framework  impedes  early  identification  of\nbanking problems, and the timely and orderly resolution of problem banks. The basic framework\nand capacity for on-site inspection and off-site surveillance have yet to be in place. There is no\nprompt corrective action system. In addition, weak capacity and shortcomings in the legal and\nregulatory  framework  for  bank  liquidation  has  hampered  and  delayed  the  early  and  orderly\nliquidation  of  delicensed  banks.  Both  the  existing  bank  regulations  and  the  capacity  of  the\nsupervisory  department  of  NBC  need  strengthening.  The  framework  for  insurance  supervision\nhas yet to be developed.\n\nFinally, the financial system lacks human resource capacity. Key regulatory bodies such\n9.\nas  NBC  and  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  need  substantial  capacity  building  to\nproperly  discharge  supervisory  and  regulatory  responsibilities.  However,  capacity  building\ninstitutions  are  constrained  by  limited  human  and  financial  resources.  Furthermore,  most  of\ncommercial  bank  staff  lack  training  in  credit  analysis,  loan  monitoring,  and  problem  loan\nmanagement, although many of the commercial banks have experienced and competent senior\nmanagers.\n\nII. \n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR BLUEPRINT\n\n10.\nAlthough the recent banking sector restructuring and other policy reforms under the IMF\nPoverty Reduction and Growth Facility have generally been moving in the right direction, it is the\nview  of  the  Government  that  Cambodia  needs  to  exert  coherent  and  systematic  efforts  to\ndevelop a sound market-based financial system to support resource mobilization and a broad-\nbased sustainable economic growth.\n\nPage 2 of 10\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\n11. With these objectives in mind, the Government has formulated the long-term vision and\ndevelopment strategy for the financial sector with the technical assistance from ADB. The long-\nterm  vision  and  development  strategy  has  been  developed  based  on  key  lessons  drawn  from\nthe  experience  of  other  Asian  economies  in  financial  sector  development,  as  well  as  from  the\ncurrent situation in Cambodia.\n\nA. \n\nLong-Term Vision and Development Strategy\n\n12.\nFinancial  sector  development  crucially  depends  on  governance  reform.  One  of  the\ncritical challenges facing Cambodia in governance is to strengthen accountability of institutions\nin  the  public  sector.  The  necessary  reforms  include,  among  others,  (i)  public  administration\nreform, (ii) public finance reform, and (iii) legal and judiciary reform.\n\n13.\nIf  the  governance  reform  programs  envisaged  in  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  II\nand  the  Governance  Action  Plan  are  fully  implemented,  it  is  expected  that  the  Cambodian\neconomy  will  be  able  to  sustain  an  average  annual  economic  growth  rate  of  6-7  percent  over\nthe medium-term.\n\n14.\nBuilding  on  the  development  prospect  to  be  achieved  from  successful  governance\nreform, the Blueprint anticipates that the financial sector will at least double in terms of the ratio\nof financial assets to GDP in ten years. The spread between loan and deposit rates will narrow\nas intermediation becomes more efficient owing to macroeconomic stability, improved legal and\nfinancial infrastructure, and increased competition among banks and other financial institutions.\n\n15.\n\nThe vision will be achieved by ensuring the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\na  competitive,  safe,  and  sound  banking  system  that  is  well  regulated  and\nsupervised  and  effectively  mobilizes  savings  to  provide  financing  to  support  the\ngrowth of the private sector;\n\nthe  establishment  and  development  of  non-bank  financial  institutions  that\nincrease  the  depth  of  financial  sector  by  providing  a  broad  array  of  diversified\nservices such as leasing and consumer finance;\n\nan  insurance  sector  that  protects  businesses  and  individuals  from  catastrophic\nevents  and  a  pension  system  that  provides  a  secure  retirement,  both  of  which\nprovide capital for long-term investment in the real sector;\n\na  safe  and  reliable  system  for  the  transfer  of  funds  between  customers  and\nbanks and the settlement of payments between banks;\n\nmoney/interbank markets that provide banks, companies, and individuals with the\nmeans for effective liquidity management;\n\nefficient  and  transparent  capital  markets  with  a  critical  mass  of  issuers  that\nmobilize funds for long-term investment;\n\na  legal  system  that  promotes  and  enforces  the  rule  of  law  in  commercial  and\nfinancial \nthat  supports  good  governance  by  promoting\ntransparency, accountability, participation, and predictability;\n\ntransactions  and \n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\f(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n52\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nan  accounting  and  audit  system  based  on  international  standards  that  supports\ngood  governance  by  promoting  transparency,  accountability,  participation,  and\npredictability; and\n\nhuman  resource  development  based  on  performance  based  compensation  and\npromotion  and  the  availability  of  a  broad  range  of  professional  programs  that\nretrains existing staff and provides ongoing training.\n\nThe  Government  has  adopted  a  long-term  strategy  for  financial  sector  development  in\n\n16.\nCambodia, which comprises the following elements:\n\nmaintaining  sound  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  to  ensure  macroeconomic\nstability;\n\nestablishing  a  sound  legal  framework  to  protect  property  rights  and  enforce\ncontracts;\n\nestablishing the rule of law through legal/judicial reform to underpin financial and\ncommercial activities;\n\nefforts \n\nparticularly\nsequencing \npayment/clearing  system,  accounting/audit  system,  credit  information  system,\nand regulatory framework;\n\ninfrastructure, \n\nfinancial \n\ndevelop \n\nto \n\nstructuring  the  regulatory  and  policy  framework  to  foster  competition  in  the\nfinancial markets and to encourage financial institutions to realize the economies\nof scale and scope;\n\nto  promote  sound\ninstitutional \nestablishing  a  regulatory  and \ngovernance principles and to allow market discipline to work in the management\nand operations of financial institutions;\n\nframework \n\n(vii) \n\nestablishing  a  sound  framework  for  private  sector  development  in  the  financial\nsystem by phasing-out state-ownership and state intervention in the system;\n\n(viii) \n\ndeveloping  a  transparent  entry  framework  to  encourage  efficiency  and  financial\ndeepening;\n\ndeveloping efficient exit mechanisms for troubled institutions to foster continuous\nreorganization in the financial system without incurring social costs; and\n\ndeveloping  human  and  institutional  capacity  in  both  private  and  public  sectors\nthrough public-private sector partnership.\n\nB. \n\nSector Development Plan\n\n17.\nUnder the guidance of the long-term strategy, the Blueprint details sector development\nstrategy  and  policy  reform  agenda.  The  sector  development  plan  explicitly  considers  the\ninterrelation of (i) human and institutional capacity building, (ii) developments in related financial\ninfrastructure, (iii) establishment of a legal and regulatory framework, (iv) emergence of relevant\nfinancial markets, and (v) availability of technology. The sector development strategy is a rolling\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\nplan, which needs continuous updating to reflect the Government\u2019s achievements as well as the\nchanging  socio-economic  environment.  The  Government  is  committed  to  implementing  the\nsector  development  plans  specified  in  the  Blueprint,  as  well  as  to  continuously  updating  the\nsector  development  plan  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  achievements  and  the  changing  socio-\neconomic environment, thus maximizing the development impact.\n\n1. \n\nBanking Sector\n\nThe  Blueprint  for  the  banking  sector  consists  of  a  strategic  goal  for  each  of  the  three\n18.\nphases. The first phase (2001 to 2004) aims at laying the foundation for the banking system by\nestablishing  basic  policy  and  institutional  framework.  The  second  phase  aims  to  enhance\nintermediation through competition. Building on the achievements in the first phase, the banking\nsystem  should  be  developed  into  a  more  consolidated  system  through  competition  among\nbanks,  intermediation  will  be  expanded  and  banking  services  will  be  extended  to  rural  areas.\nThe  third  phase  aims  to  promote  intermediation  efficiency  by  facilitating  the  integration  of  the\nformal  and  informal  financial  sectors  as  well  as  the  reorganization  of  the  banking  industry.  An\nintegrated  banking  sector  will  enhance  efficiency  and  quality  of  banking  services  in  the  rural\nareas.\n\n2. \n\nInsurance Sector and Pension System\n\n19.\nThe development of the insurance sector will also go through three phases. To improve\nthe  current  weak  legal  infrastructure  and  supervisory  capacity,  the  first  phase  aims  at\nestablishing the foundation and building capacity for the sector. With a solid foundation in place,\nthe insurance sector will develop in terms of size and diversity. The focus of the second phase\nwill  be  to  promote  the  insurance  market  through  private  sector  development,  to  increase  the\noutreach to poor and rural areas, to implement compulsory insurance, and to enhance product\nvariety. The implementation of compulsory insurance will create policy-driven demand, and the\ngrowing income will generate demand for a greater variety of insurance products. In response to\nthe  growing  sophistication  and  volume  of  business  in  the  insurance  sector,  an  independent\ninsurance  supervisory  and  regulatory  body  will  be  established.  As  the  insurance  sector\nexpands, the independent insurance supervisor will further upgrade prudential regulations in the\nthird phase.\n\n20.\nDuring  the  first  phase  of  pension  system  development,  the  feasibility  and  design  for\nestablishing  a  multi-pillar  pension  system  will  be  completed.  During  Phase  II,  the  legal,\nregulatory, and supervisory frameworks will be established for the pension system. In addition, a\ncapacity-building  mechanism  will  be  needed  to  ensure  properly  trained  staff  in  the  regulatory\nand  supervisory  body.  During  Phase  III,  the  legal  framework  will  be  enhanced  through  the\nissuance  of  sub-decrees.  The  mandatory  public  pension  program  will  be  launched  and  the\nsupervisory  and  regulatory  framework  will  be  further  strengthened  in  anticipation  of  the\nimplementation  of  the  mandatory  privately  managed  funded  pension  program  that  will  be\nimplemented after Phase III.\n\n3. \n\nNon-Banking Financial Institutions\n\n21.\nThe  development  of  non-banking  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  begins  in  the  second\nphase.  The  development  goal  is  to  provide  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  NBFIs\ncommensurate with the development of interbank/money markets and capital markets. Thus the\ngoal of Phase II is to establish the foundation of laws and regulations for NBFIs such as leasing\ncompanies, finance companies, investment companies and money market broker/dealers. The\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\ngoal  of  Phase  III  is  set  to  further  develop  the  NBFI  sector  including  trust  companies,  venture\ncapital  companies  and  longer-term  development  finance  institutions.  These  institutions  will\nsupport the development of money and capital markets.\n\n4. \n\nInterbank/Money Markets\n\n22.\nThe sequencing and pacing of money markets development will match the development\nof  the  banking  and  non-banking  sectors  The  development  plan  for  interbank  and  money\nmarkets  targets  three  strategic  goals.  The  first  phase  aims  to  establish  the  foundation  for  a\nmarket  in  short-term  unsecured  interbank  lending,  and  provide  a  base  for  money  markets\n(including  Treasury  Bills),  based  on  a  Negotiable  Instruments  Law.  The  second  phase  will\nstrengthen  the  interbank  markets,  by  establishing  regulations  for  diverse  money  market\ninstruments  such  as  negotiable  CDs,  repurchase  agreements,  etc.,  as  well  as  by  regularizing\nthe issuance of Treasury Bills with the development of a primary dealer system. The third phase\nis  to  broaden  money  markets  with  a  regulatory  framework  for  non-financial  issuers  of  money\nmarket instruments such as commercial papers.\n\n5. \n\nCapital Markets\n\n23.\nThe Government has taken initial actions in developing capital markets, and this process\nwill  continue.  During  the  first  phase,  necessary  preparatory  work  is  expected  to  create  an\nenabling environment for capital markets. In the second phase, it is envisaged to establish the\nfoundation  for  capital  markets  by  developing  necessary  infrastructure  related  to  securities\ntrading,  as  well  as  adopting  detailed  regulations  and  procedures.  Building  on  the  preparatory\nwork,  it  is  expected  that  the  Government  will  make  a  systematic  effort  to  develop  capital\nmarkets in the third phase.\n\n6. \n\nFinancial Market Infrastructure\n\na. \n\nDevelopment of Legal Infrastructure\n\n24.\nThe  development  of  the  legal  infrastructure  for  financial  markets  also  targets  three\nreform agenda over the next ten years. The goal in Phase I is to introduce key laws pertaining\nto commercial activities to underpin financial sector development. In Phase II, law enforcement\nwill  be  strengthened  with  the  progress  in  court  reforms  and  capacity  building.  Phase  III  will\nfocus on enhancing legal infrastructure for private sector development; during the period, a legal\nframework for public registration system for movables will be established.\n\nb. \n\nDevelopment of the Accounting/Audit System\n\nThe accounting/audit system is the base for financial sector development and demands\n25.\nurgent attention. The goal in Phase I is to establish accounting/audit standards and a system for\ntheir  enforcement  through  promulgation  of  a  Law  on  Corporate  Accounts,  their  Audit  and  the\nAccounting  Profession,  adoption  of  IAS/ISA  standards,  and  establishment  of  an  accounting\nprofessional  body  and  an  Accounting/Audit  Standards  Board.  In  Phase  II,  the  accounting\nassociation  will  strengthen  the  enforcement  of  accounting/audit  standards,  and  promote\ncompetition  in  accounting  industry  to  reduce  accounting/audit  compliance  costs  of  the  private\nsector. In Phase III, enforcement of accounting standards and expansion of IAS to more firms\nwill occur.\n\nPage 6 of 10\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 2, page 7\n\nc. \n\nDevelopment of Financial Information Infrastructure\n\n26.\nFor  efficient  financial  intermediation,  development  of  a  financial  information  system  is\ncrucial to cultivate credit and repayment culture in the early stage of financial development. In\nPhase  I,  the  Government  will  create  the  financial  market  information  system  via  banker-led\narrangements  for  sharing  credit  information.  During  Phase  II,  the  Government  will  expand  the\nscope  of  the  arrangements  to  non-bank  institutions.  In  Phase  III,  financial  market  information\nsystem will be further diversified by including a credit rating industry.\n\nd. \n\nDevelopment of a Financial Sector Safety Net\n\n27.\nA  financial  safety  net  will  be  developed  to  bolster  public  confidence  in  the  financial\nsystem.  As  the  financial  system  expands,  so  do  the  systemic  risks.  The  development  of  the\nfinancial  safety  net  includes  a  two-stage  reform  agenda  starting  from  Phase  II.  The  goal  of\nPhase II is to develop a banking sector safety net with the establishment of deposit insurance\nand  corporate  governance  guidelines.  Phase  III  will  expand  deposit  insurance  to  the  non-\nbanking sector participants who join the payment system.\n\nIII. \n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nAlthough necessary, the implementation of the long-term policy reform envisaged under\n28.\nthe  Blueprint  is  challenging  to  the  Government  due  to  the  limited  social  capital  and  capacity.\nThus,  the  Government  is  in  need  of,  and  thus  requests,  systematic  and  concerted  financial\nassistance and policy advice from international institutions. As the first step of such assistance,\nthe Government requests for ADB\u2019s proposed Financial Sector Development Program.\n\nThe Government is committed to achieve the following goals of the FSDP, as an effort to\n\n29.\nimplement the reform agenda in the Blueprint:\n\n(i) \n\nenhancing  banking  intermediation  and  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system\nand building capacity in both public and private sectors,\n\n(ii) \n\nestablishing legal and regulatory framework for insurance sector development,\n\n(iii) \n\nlaying the foundation for the development of interbank/money markets, and\n\n(iv) \n\ndeveloping  financial  market  infrastructure  by  establishing  common  accounting\nstandards and enforcement mechanisms as well as introducing key legislation.\n\n1. \n\nBanking Sector Development\n\n30.\nUnder  the  FSDP,  the  Government  will  focus  on  key  policy  agenda  to  address  key\nimpediments  identified  in  the  Blueprint,  which  include,  among  others,  (i)  strengthening  bank\nsupervision  and  prudential  regulations,  (ii)  completion  of  bank  restructuring  under  the  IMF\nPRGF  program,  (iii)  developing  banking  sector  infrastructure  and  safety  net,  and  (iv)\nestablishment and strengthening of capacity building institutions.\n\n31.\nFirst,  to  strengthen  bank  supervision  and  prudential  regulations,  the  Government\nwill (i) reconcile old prudential regulations with new regulations and issue clarifying guidance to\ncommercial  banks,  (ii)  fully  staff  the  on-site  inspection  division  of  Banking  Supervision\nDepartment,  (iii)  adopt  surveillance  and  inspection  procedures  including  standardization  of  the\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 2, page 8\n\nreports submitted by commercial banks, (iv) adopt a prompt corrective action system acceptable\nto ADB, and (v) adopt and implement an anti-money laundering regulation.\n\nSecond, \n\n32.\nthe  Government  will  complete  bank  restructuring,  which  has  been\nundertaken  under  the  IMF  PRGF.  In  particular,  the  Government  will  make  efforts  to  expedite\nliquidation of closed banks and prepare itself to deal with conditionally viable banks, which do\nnot  comply  with  the  conditions  specified  in  the  bank  restructuring  MOU  signed  between  those\nbanks and NBC. Under FSDP, the Government will adopt a comprehensive training program for\nFTB including accounting, risk management, asset/liabilities management, MIS, etc.\n\n33.\nThird,  the  Government  will  develop  banking  sector  infrastructure  and  safety  net.\nAlong  with  the  adoption  of  common  accounting  standards  consistent  with  IAS/ISA,  the\nGovernment  will  adopt  a  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and  a  disclosure  rule  consistent  with\nIAS  for  the  commercial  banks.  The  Government  will  also  establish  arrangements  for  sharing\ncredit  information  among  the  members  of  the  Bankers  Association  and  secured  transactions\nsystem. In addition, the Government will initiate the development of banking sector safety net to\nbolster  the  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system.  That  is,  the  Government  will  work  out  an\nofficial  plan  to  develop  a  deposit  insurance  system  to  safeguard  small  depositors  in  the\ncommercial banks.\n\nFourth, \n\nthe  Government  will  strengthen  capacity  building \n\ninstitutions.  The\n34.\nGovernment will first strengthen the existing Center for Banking Studies (CBS) by separating it\nfrom NBC, and establish as a subsidiary of NBC with separate management and accounts. To\ndevelop CBS as a prime training institution for central bank and other government agencies, the\nGovernment will establish a central banking course for NBC professional staff and a mandatory\ncourse  for  the  entry-level  professional  staff  in  CBS.  The  Government  will  also  support  the\nestablishment  of  a  comprehensive  banking  institute  for  private  bank  staff  under  the  bankers\nassociation to meet an increasing demand for professional training in the banking sector.\n\n2. \n\nInsurance Sector Development\n\nThe Government is committed to insurance sector development envisaged under FSDP,\n35.\n(i)  establishing  and  strengthening  of\nfocussing  on \nsupervisory/regulatory \nfor  compulsory\ninsurance, (iii) promoting private sector development, and (iv) capacity building in the insurance\nsector.\n\nframework,  (ii)  establishing  regulatory \n\nfollowing  strategic  areas: \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\nFirst, \n\n36.\nthe  Government  will  establish  and  strengthen  supervisory/regulatory\nframework for insurance by establishing an insurance supervisory unit under MEF, adopting\nsub-decree to implement the new Insurance Law, and adopting regulations to apply IAS/ISA to\nthe insurance sector.\n\n37.\nSecond,  the  Government  will  make  concerted  efforts  with  the  related  line  ministries  to\nestablish a regulatory framework for compulsory insurance. The Government will set up an\ninter-ministerial  working  group  to  draft  an  official  plan  for  compulsory  insurance  development.\nThe  plan  will  include,  among  others,  adoption  of  supporting  laws  and  establishment  of\nenforcement and monitoring mechanism.\n\nThird,  the  Government  will  promote  private  sector  development  in  the  insurance\n38.\nsector. As the first step for the private sector development, the Government will complete the\nestablishment of joint venture between the state-owned CAMINCO and a private company, and\n\nPage 8 of 10\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 2, page 9\n\nadopt a plan to divest the Government\u2019s share in the joint venture to avoid conflict of interests,\nalong with the establishment of a transparent entry mechanism for the private sector.\n\n39.\nFourth,  the  Government  will  also  exert  efforts  to  build  capacity  in  the  insurance\nsector. Due to the short history of the sector, initial capacity building efforts will need assistance\nfrom donor agencies and foreign insurance training institutes. The Government will establish a\ntraining program for capacity building in related Government agencies, which will be involved in\nthe  enforcement  and  monitoring  of  compulsory  insurance.  The  capacity  building  will  be  an\nintegral  part  of  the  official  plan  for  compulsory  insurance.  As  the  sector  size  increases  and\nproducts  diversify,  the  Government  will  also  consider  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive\ninsurance training institute.\n\n3. \n\nDevelopment of Interbank/Money Markets\n\n40.\nDevelopment  of  interbank/money  market  is  critical  to  help  reduce  operating  costs  of\nbanks  and  other  financial  institutions  in  Cambodia.  The  Government  will  play  a  pivotal  role  in\nestablishing  interbank/money  markets.  For  this,  the  Government  will  fully  support  the\nestablishment  of  an  inclusive  bankers  association.  The  Government  will  also  adopt  a\ncomprehensive Negotiable Instruments Law, which covers all types of instruments from simple\npayment instruments to credit instruments. In addition, the Government will set up the regulatory\nframework  for  the  interbank  market  activities,  and  provide  detailed  procedures  for  issuing\ninterbank/money market instruments.\n\n41.\nThe  Government  will  continue  to  make  efforts  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for\ncapital  market  development.  To  begin  with,  the  Government  will  adopt  a  Securities  and\nExchange  Law  following  the  promulgation  of  Law  on  Commercial  Enterprises  and  Law  on\nCorporate Accounts, their Audit and the Accounting Profession.\n\n4. \n\nDevelopment of Accounting and Legal Infrastructure\n\n42.\nIn  recognition  of  the  importance  of  the  market  infrastructure  development,  the\nGovernment  will  put  substantial  emphasis  on  the  development  of  market  infrastructure  to\nunderpin the financial market. The Government will put the first priority in the establishment of\naccounting  standards  and  enforcement  system,  which  includes  (i)  promulgation  of  Law  on\nCorporate Accounts, their Audit and the Accounting Profession; (ii) adoption of a sub-decree to\napply  IAS/ISA  to  all  companies  incorporated  in  Cambodia;  (iii)  establishment  of  a  National\nAccounting  Council  which  will  be  in  charge  of  setting  and  interpreting  standards,  etc.;  (iv)\nadoption of official translation of IAS/ISA; (v) establishment of an association of accountants and\nauditors;  (vi)  adoption  of  a  code  of  ethics  that  complies  with  the  requirements  of  the\nInternational Federation of Accountants; and (vii) establish committees on education and ethics\nwithin the association.\n\n43.\nThe Government will complete key legislation to underpin the financial sector and private\nsector  development,  which  includes  Civil  Code,  Law  on  Commercial  Enterprises,  Bankruptcy\nLaw, Secured Transactions Law, etc. The Government will also initiate a comprehensive judicial\nreform  supported  by  ADB  and  World  Bank  to  enhance  enforcement  of  the  law.  Among  these\nreform agenda, the Government is committed to adopt a Law on Commercial Enterprises and a\nSecurities and Exchange Law.\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 2, page 10\n\nIV. \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT\u2019S COMMITMENT AND REQUEST\n\n44.\nThe  Government  with  ADB  assistance  has  established  a  long-term  vision  and\ndevelopment  strategy  for  its  nascent  financial  sector.  The  Government  believes  that  the\nBlueprint and FSDP will move the country\u2019s financial sector forward and will provide the basis\nfor  the  development  of  Cambodia's  financial  sector  with  all  the  associated  benefits  for  private\nsector growth and long-term poverty reduction.\n\nThe  Blueprint  has  the  highest  commitment  of  the  Government,  as  attested  by  the\n45.\nGovernment\u2019s  adoption  of  the  Blueprint  as  its  official  financial  sector  development  plan.\nFurthermore,  the  Government  is  fully  committed  to  carry  out  FSDP  as  the  core  policy  reform\nenvisaged  in  the  Blueprint.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  established  the  Financial  Sector\nSteering  Committee  and  Working  Group  representing  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,\nMinistry  of  Commerce,  National  Bank  of  Cambodia,  and  Council  for  the  Development  of\nCambodia.\n\nNevertheless,  the  Government  is  fully  aware  that  this  undertaking,  although  clearly\n46.\nneeded, is fraught with difficulties and will be undertaken with limited social capital and human\nresources.  It  is  crucial  that  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  help  implement  the  policy  reform  of  FSDP  be\nprovided in a timely manner. With the assistance of ADB and other development partners, the\nGovernment is prepared to forge ahead.\n\n47.\nConsequently,  we  trust  that  ADB  will  consider  favorably  the  Government\u2019s  request  for\napproval of the program loan cluster of $30 million and a loan of $10 million for Program I of the\nFSDP.  We  strongly  urge  ADB  to  provide  further  loans  of  $10  million  each  to  continue  policy\nreforms in Program II and III of the FSDP.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKeat Chhon\nSenior Minister of Economy and Finance\nMinistry of Economy and Finance\n\nChea Chanto\nGovernor\nNational Bank of Cambodia\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX OF FINANCIAL SECTOR PROGRAM\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nSUBPROGRAM I\n\n1ST TRANCHE\n\n2ND TRANCHE\n\nI. \n\nDevelopment of the Banking Sector\n\nSUBPROGRAM II\n\nSUBPROGRAM III\n\nEstablishing\nBank\nSupervision/\nPrudential\nRegulations\n\n1.

This  appendix  analyzes\nCambodia\u2019s  poverty  profile,  describes  the  strategy  of  the  Government  of  Cambodia  fighting\npoverty, and examines the impact of the FSPL on poverty reduction in Cambodia.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty Profile\n\n2.\nAs of  1999, Cambodia  had 11.4 million people, about 84 percent of whom were in the\nrural  areas.  The  prolonged  domestic  strife  has  caused  negative  population  growth  rate  during\nthe  Khmer  Rouge  period,  but  the  population  grew  at  an  estimated  2.5  percent  per  year  in  the\n1990s. This resulted in a low average age, as children under 14 accounted for 43 percent of the\npopulation.\n\n3.\nWith  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  lingering  around  $260  in  the  1990s,\nCambodia had an estimated poverty ratio of 36 percent as of 1999,1 and almost 90 percent of\nthe  poor  were  in  the  rural  areas.2  The  rapidly  growing  population  added  burdens  to  the  poor,\nand  poorer  households  tended  to  have  a  larger  share  of  children.  The  poverty  rate  also  rose\nwith  household  heads\u2019  age;  the  rate  peaked  at  those  households  with  the  heads  in  the  36-40\nyears  group.  In  urban  areas,  the  unemployment  rate  was  higher,  and  households  with  female\nheads were at a disadvantage compared with those with male heads.\n\n4.\nThe  financial  sector  in  Cambodia  offers  limited  services  in  urban  areas.  The  financial\nservices are confined to a small group of better-known firms and are out of the reach of most of\nthe  poor  population.  The  rural  population  relies  on  microfinance  and  moneylenders  charging\ninterest  rates as high  as 10-30 percent per month.3 Even so, there exists a substantial gap in\nrural  credit  as  the  estimated  rural  credit  demand  stands  at  $120  million  per  year.  The  limited\nsize,  location,  and  products  of  the  financial  institutions  restrict  the  sector\u2019s  ability  to  generate\nemployment. By the end of 2000, the total employees of the financial sector is around 3,300, of\nwhich  1,078  people  in  commercial  banks,  150  in  insurance  companies,  and  around  2,100  are\nemployed in approximately 120 rural credit nongovernment organizations around the country.4\n\nC. \n\nGovernment Strategy in Poverty Reduction\n\n5.\nPoverty reduction in Cambodia is a daunting challenge and has been a top priority target\nof  the  policy  measures.  The  Government  recognizes  that  economic  growth  and  programs\ntargeting  the  poor  are  the  two  major  driving  forces  for  poverty  reduction.  In  addition  to\nmacroeconomic  stability,  sustainable  economic  growth  critically  depends  on  efficient  resource\nmobilization  and  allocation,  which  builds  on  governance  reform,  private  sector  development,\n\n                                                          \n1  The poverty line is defined, in monetary terms, as KR54,050 ($14) per person per month, or about $0.50 per day.\n2  The Ministry of Planning, Cambodia. 2000.

The  high  spread  results  mainly  from  uncertainties  regarding  law/contract\nenforcement  (e.g.,  difficulties  and  uncertainties  in  registering  secured  interest)  and  borrowers\u2019\ncreditworthiness. More than 80 percent of businesses have no access to credit, according to an\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) survey.7 The survey also reveals that access to capital\nis the primary concern of SME managers, and that lack of access to credit has become a major\nimpediment for the private sector, especially SMEs. To improve the situation, the FSPL supports\nstrengthening  banking  supervision;  establishing  interbank/money  markets;  developing  legal,\njudiciary,  and  accounting  and  auditing  systems  and  key  information  infrastructure;  and\nreinforcing  capacity-building  institutions.  All  these  efforts  will  reduce  uncertainties  and  risks  in\nfinancial transactions, and promote public confidence (Table A4.1).\n\n7.\nAlong with governance reforms, the successful implementation of the FSPL will reduce\nthe interest rate spread, mainly by relieving uncertainties and risks stemming from lack of legal\nand financial infrastructure. Specifically, adopting a secured transactions law and establishing a\npublic registration system will reduce uncertainties related to collateral value and security. The\nestablishment of common accounting and auditing standards and enforcement mechanisms will\nreduce  uncertainties  related  to  borrower\u2019s  performance  and  creditworthiness.  In  addition,  the\ndevelopment  of  financial  information  infrastructure  including  arrangements  for  sharing  credit\ninformation  will  reduce  information  costs  of  banks.  The  establishment  of  interbank/money\nmarkets will also reduce the operating costs of banks as liquidity management will enable them\nto  reduce  nonearning  assets.  On  the  other  hand,  together  with  successful  bank  restructuring\nprograms, strengthening the prudential regulations and supervisory capacity will enhance public\nconfidence in the banking system. This will increase deposit mobilization and further bring down\nthe bank\u2019s funding cost, and thus the interest spread. A decreased interest rate spread directly\nbenefits  the  poor  in  two  ways.  First,  reduced  uncertainties  and  risks  will  substantially  tighten\ninterest  rate  spread,  which  prevents  most  of  the  population  from  accessing  financial  services.\nWith  lower  interest  rates,  the  poor  (who  are  currently  excluded  from  banking  services)  will  be\nable  to  access  bank  loans  and  other  services.  This  impact  of  poverty  reduction  will  be\nstrengthened as the reduced interest rate of banks will put downward pressure on the interest\nrate  of  microfinance  providers.  Second,  a  lower  interest  spread  is  important  to  the  private\nsector,  especially  SMEs  and  microenterprises,  as  it  gives  many  of  them  to  access  working\ncapital.  Lower  funding  cost  will  enable  them  to  cut  operational  cost  and  expand  business\nopportunities. The expansion of SMEs and microenterprises will reduce poverty as most of the\nindustries are at the nascent stage and are labor-intensive.\n\n                                                          \n5 Government  of  Cambodia.  1994.

Most\nof  the  policy  purchasers  are  foreign  companies  and  international  organizations.  Part  of  the\nreason  is  that  the  supervisory  system  failed  to  convince  the  public  that  the  supervisory\nauthorities oversight insurance companies. Such lack of confidence resulted in limited demand\nfor  insurance  products.  Furthermore,  a  weak  legal  framework  and  supervision  capacity\nundermines the supply of insurance products to cover diverse commercial activities. Thus, most\nbusinesses, especially SMEs, are exposed to catastrophic events. Most of the poor public and\nSMEs  cannot  afford  to  pay  the  currently  high  premiums,  which  are  out  of  line  with  market\nequilibrium  level.  In  fact,  no  one  will  purchase  an  insurance  policy  unless  one  has  to.  The\ncatastrophic events are particularly costly to the poor public and SMEs as Cambodia does not\nhave a social safety net.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\nTable A4.2: Poverty Impact of the Insurance Sector Development\n\nDirect Effect\n\nIndirect Effect\n\nMacro\n\nMitigation\nMeasures\n\nThe private sector, especially\nsmall- and medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs), development\nwill be enhanced, and thus will\ngenerate more employment and\nincome.\nLower insurance premiums will\nreduce the expenses of\nindividuals as well as the\noperational cost of the private\nsector, including SMEs.\nThe new insurance products will\nenable SMEs to enlarge domestic\nand international business\nopportunities.\n\nDevelopment of\nthe insurance\nsector will lead to\na more balanced\nand competitive\nfinancial structure,\nand reduce the\nincome fluctuation\nof individuals and\nbusinesses, thus\ncontributing to\nmacroeconomic\nstability.\n\nItem\n\nLabor\n\nPrices\n\nAccess for Poor\n\nTransfers\n\nAssumptions\n\nMarket-based insurance\npremiums will reflect the\ndemand and supply\nconditions, and allow the\npoor public and SMEs\nwho were previously\nunable to access\ninsurance products.\n\nThe availability of\ninsurance products and\ndiversified services will\nreduce the cost of\ncatastrophic events to\npoor and SMEs.\n\nEstablishment of an insurance supervisory framework will promote public confidence and\nawareness of insurance and thus increase the demand for insurance. Enhanced private sector\nparticipation with a level playing field will unleash competition, resulting in market-based\npremiums.\nEstablishment of a legal framework for compulsory insurance will facilitate the introduction of\ncompulsory insurance products.\nFull-scale governance reforms, including legal and judicial reform, and corporate governance\nreform.\nEnforcement/monitoring mechanism for compulsory insurance will be in place with supporting\nlaws.\n\nTotal Net Effect\n\nPositive.\n\n9.\nThe FSPL targets the establishment of the basic regulatory and supervisory framework\nto build public confidence in and awareness of insurance. It also supports the development of\nan  enforcement  mechanism  for  compulsory  insurance  (Table  A4.2).  In  addition,  by  privatizing\nthe state-owned insurance company and offering equal opportunities, the program will support\nprivate  sector  development.  Through  these  policy  measures,  the  FSPL  directly  supports  the\ndevelopment  of  the  insurance  market  by  enlarging  the  supply  capacity  of  the  insurance\nbusiness on one hand and by creating policy-driven demand for insurance on the other hand.\n\n10.\nThe  establishment  of  the  basic  supervisory  framework  will  promote  public  confidence\nand awareness of insurance. Once the public gains confidence in the soundness of insurance\ncompanies  and  the  enforcement  of  insurance  policies,  the  demand  for  insurance  products  will\nincrease  and  more  diversified  products  will  be  supplied.  In  turn,  more  businesses  including\nSMEs  will  have  access  to  insurance  products  needed  to  protect  and  expand  their  commercial\nactivities.  Moreover,  the  establishment  of  a  legal  framework  for  compulsory  insurance  will  lay\nthe foundation for the emergence of compulsory insurance products.\n\n11. With equal opportunities and active private sector participation, the insurance sector will\nunleash  competition  to  bring  the  premium  close  to  a  market-based  level  (which  will  reflect\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\ndemand and supply conditions). The competition will also encourage the insurance companies\nto  diversify  their  products  to  meet  the  demands  of  individuals  as  well  as  businesses  including\nSMEs.  For  example,  the  provision  of  export/import  insurance  will  allow  the  expansion  and\nprotection of the private sector especially SMEs. The diversified products and reduced premium\nwill  increase  the  demand  for  insurance  products,  which  will  help  the  insurance  companies  to\nexpand in terms of scale and outreach. On the macro level, the expanded scale and outreach of\ninsurance  companies  will  facilitate  a  more  balanced  and  competitive  financial  structure,  and\nsupport broad-based sustainable economic growth.\n\n3. \n\nDevelopment of Interbank/Money Markets\n\nTable A4.3: Poverty Impact of Development of Interbank/Money Markets\n\nDirect Effect\n\nIndirect Effect\n\nMacro\n\nMitigation\nMeasures\n\nItem\n\nLabor\n\nPrices\n\nDevelopment of private\nsector especially\nsmall- and medium-\nsized enterprises will\ngenerate more\nemployment\nopportunities.\nReduced financial\nintermediation cost\nand the real sector\u2019s\nfunding cost will help\nto stabilize general\nprice level.\n\nReduced\ntransaction\ncost of\nfinancial\ninstitutions and\nfunding cost of\nthe real sector\nwill reduce and\nstabilize the\ngeneral price\nlevel, which\nwill contribute\nto\nmacroeconomi\nc stability and\nsustainable\neconomic\ngrowth.\n\nReduced operating cost of financial\ninstitutions due to the development of\ninterbank/money markets will help tighten\nthe interest rate spread. Moreover,\nintegration of formal and informal sectors\nthrough interbank markets will further\ntighten the gap in interest spreads\nbetween urban and rural areas. As a\nresult, the funding cost of the private\nsector, especially SMEs, will be cut down.\n\nAccess for Poor\n\nTransfers\n\nThe poor\u2019s access to credit and asset\naccumulation will be improved.\nThe establishment of interbank/money markets will enable liquidity management,\nreduce a bank\u2019s nonearning assets, and thus operating costs. Interbank markets will\nfacilitate the integration of formal and informal sectors, and thus spread the benefit of\nreduced operating costs into the rural areas.\n\nAssumptions\n\nNational Bank of Cambodia will develop payment and interbank clearing systems, and a regulatory\nframework to monitor and facilitate interbank/money markets activities.\n\nTotal Net Effect\n\nPositive\n\n12.\nCurrently,  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  offers  only  short-term  bank  loans  at  high  rates.\nHigh  funding  cost  can  be  attributed  to  the  high  operating  cost  of  financial  institutions.  Lack  of\ninterbank/money  markets  prevents  liquidity  management  by  financial  institutions,  and  leads  to\nexcessive  nonearning  assets  (e.g.,  cash)  and  high  operating  cost.  Without  interbank/money\nmarkets, high funding cost and limited funding sources are expected to continue in the future,\nwhich will further widen the financing gap in both urban and rural areas. The FSPL supports the\nestablishment  of  these  markets  by  establishing  a  bankers  association  to  lay  down  the\ninstitutional basis for interbank/money markets and establishing the legal framework by adopting\na  negotiable  instruments  law.  The  impact  of  the  development  of  interbank/money  markets  on\npoverty is given in Table A4.3\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 4, page 6\n\nThe  establishment  and  development  of  interbank/money  markets  will  reduce  financial\n13.\ninstitutions\u2019  costs  related  to  liquidity  management.  The  spread  of  lending  and  deposit  rates  in\nbanks in urban areas will tighten in the short term, and the impact will increase and expand over\ntime. The development of interbank/money markets will lead to gradual integration of the formal\nand  informal  financial  markets  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas,  because  financial  institutions  in\nrural  areas  can  also  participate  in  the  interbank  markets  to  borrow  or  lend  to  manage  their\nliquidity.  The  integration  of  the  formal  and  informal  financial  markets  will  allow  the  benefits  of\nenhanced banking services and reduced interest rate spread to be disseminated to borrowers in\nthe rural areas as well.\n\n4. \n\nEstablishment of Financial Infrastructure and Safety Net\n\nTable A4.4: Poverty Impact of Establishing Financial Infrastructure and Safety Net\n\nDirect Effect\n\nIndirect Effect\n\nMacro\n\nMitigation\nMeasures\n\nItem\n\nLabor\n\nPrices\n\nEstablishment of common\naccounting and auditing\nstandards and their enforcement\nsystem will reduce uncertainties\nin lending (and thus risk\npremium), and tighten interest\nrate spread. This means lower\nfunding cost for the private\nsector, especially SMEs.\n\nEconomic growth will\nincrease potential\nemployment from private\nsector, especially small-\nand medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs).\n\nReduced funding cost of\nthe real sectors will bring\ndown the general price\nlevel.\n\nEstablishment of\nfinancial\ninfrastructure will\npromote confidence\nin the financial\nsystem, and in turn\npromote resource\nmobilization.\n\nReduced funding\ncost and increased\nfund availability will\npromote real sector\ndevelopment,\nincrease\nemployment,\nstabilize price level,\nand thus contribute\nto sustainable\nmacroeconomic\ngrowth.\n\nAccess for Poor\n\nThe poor\u2019s access to financial\nservices will improve.\n\nIncreased savings and\ncompensation on savings\nwill promote growth of\nfamily assets.\n\nTransfers\n\nAssumptions\n\nEstablishment of a secured transactions system will reduce uncertainties related to\nthe value and security of collateral, and promote collateral-based lending.\nEstablishment of common accounting and auditing standards and their enforcement\nsystem will reduce uncertainties related to borrower\u2019s performance, and promote\ncash flow-based lending.\nEstablishment of deposit insurance system will promote public confidence in the\nfinancial system and enhance resource mobilization.\n\nFull-scale governance reform including legal and judicial reform will reduce\nuncertainty regarding law/contract enforcement and adverse selection cost.\nRule of law and transparency and establishment of a safety net will promote public\nconfidence in the financial system.\nGovernment\u2019s strong commitment, sufficient human resource, and financial support.\n\nTotal Net Effect\n\nPositive.\n\nThe current lack of or weak financial infrastructure and safety net is the major reason for\n14.\nthe  wide  interest  rate  spread  and  nonexistence  of  many  types  of  financial  services.  In\nCambodia,  many  key  laws  to  underpin  commercial  activities  are  yet  to  be  in  place,  and  law\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 4, page 7\n\nenforcement is yet to be strengthened. For example, lack of an enterprises law and a securities\nand exchange law precludes debt and equity financing. The situation is further compromised by\nlack  of  common  accounting  standards  and  enforcement  mechanisms.  Moreover,  lack  of  a\ndeposit insurance system further reduced public confidence in the fragile banking system.\n\n15.\nThe  establishment  of  financial  infrastructure  \u2013  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  the\nenforcement  mechanisms,  and  key  information  infrastructure  \u2013  will  reduce  uncertainties  (and\nthus  interest  spread)  and  increase  credit  availability  to  the  private  sector,  especially  SMEs\n(Table A4.4). The establishment of a legal infrastructure, notably, the adoption of an enterprises\nlaw and a securities and exchange law along with an accounting and auditing law will provide\nthe legal basis for various funding sources. An enterprises law and a securities and exchange\nlaw will lay the foundation for companies to issue different types of corporate securities. With the\nsupport of the accounting and auditing system reform and other corporate governance reforms,\nCambodia  can  expect  the  emergence  of  capital  markets,  which  will  provide  more  funding  at\nlower cost. A deposit insurance system protects small depositors from loss in the case of bank\nfailure.  It  can  promote  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  and,  in  turn,  its  resource\nmobilization  capacity.  More  deposit  means  increased  funding  sources  and  fund  availability  to\nthe private sector, especially SMEs.\nE.\n\nConclusion\n\n16.\n\nThe overall benefits of the FSPL for poverty reduction can be summarized as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA well-functioning financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, will\nprovide  resources  for  real  economic  activity,  especially  for  private  sector\ndevelopment, including SMEs that will create employment opportunities.\n\nA well-diversified financial sector will increase the outreach of financial services\nto rural and poor areas.\n\nA well-regulated financial system will enhance public confidence in banking and,\ncapacity  for  resource  mobilization.  A  sound  and  efficient  financial  system  will\nfacilitate resource allocation, a prerequisite for private sector development. This\nwill support broad-based economic growth and the poverty reduction target set in\nthe Government\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan for 2001-2005.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 5\n\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS\n\n1.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign currency expenditures for\nthe  reasonable  cost  of  imported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or  taxes)  required  during\nimplementation of the Financial Sector Program.
