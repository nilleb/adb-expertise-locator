The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund1 \nfor  Strengthening  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Finance,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA.2 \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  financial  intermediation  loan  will  provide  local  currency  credit  to  sustain \noperations of and employment by MSMEs during the current economic slowdown. The TA will \nstrengthen  credit  origination  and  management  of  selected  participating  financial  institutions \n(PFIs) to better serve MSMEs.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nKazakhstan\u2019s  economy  significantly  depends  on  hydrocarbons,  which \n\nin  2015 \n3. \nrepresented 25% of its gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 70% of export revenues. \nWhile  GDP  growth  was  robust  at  an  average  10.2%  per  annum  during  2000\u20132007,  economic \nperformance  has  been  volatile  since  the  2008  global  financial  crisis. The  economy  rebounded \nwith an average GDP growth of 6.5% (2010\u20132013) but then declined to 4.2% (2014), dropped \nsharply to 1.2% in 2015, and is expected to remain subdued at 0.1% in 2016.4 The slowdown is \na result of a sharp drop in hydrocarbon revenues, the recession in the Russian Federation, and \nweakening  demand  from  Kazakhstan\u2019s  main  trading  partners.  The  reduction  in  foreign \nexchange income in 2015 prompted the central bank to move to a floating exchange rate regime. \nFrom  2014  to  mid-2016,  the  tenge  lost  55.8%  of  its  value  against  the  US  dollar5 and,  despite \nprice controls and a restrictive monetary policy, inflation nearly doubled to 13.6% at the end of \n2015,  from  7.4%  at  the  end  of  2014.6 Improving  MSMEs\u2019  productivity,  and  the  resilience  of \nmicroenterprises as a source of income for the low-income population, is essential to boost the \nnon-oil economy and reduce macroeconomic volatility. \n \n4. \nWhile  the  cities  of  Astana  and  Almaty  and  the  Atyrau  region  generated  42%  of  value \naddition  in  2015,  86%  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  17.5 million  residents  live  in  rural  districts  and regional \ntowns.  Agriculture  represents  24%  of  employment.  In  2015,  the  rural  poverty  head  count  of \n4.7%  exceeded  the  urban  poverty  head  count  of  1.4%,  indicating  that  the  rural  population  is \nprimarily  engaged  in  low-productivity  agriculture  and  trapped  in  low-wage  jobs.  Support  of  the \nrural  economy  is  essential  to  sustain  income  for  low-income  families  and  create  demand  for \n\n                                                 \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ngoods and services provided by MSMEs, including farmers. However, agricultural productivity is \nhampered by low standards of quality and inadequate infrastructure. Financial service coverage \nin rural areas is inadequate\u2014only 48% of rural adults have a bank account.7 \n \nIn 2015, Kazakhstan had 1.1 million MSMEs, of which 930,000 were sole proprietorships, \n5. \n176,000  small  enterprises,  and  2,900  medium-sized  enterprises.8 Sole  proprietors  employed \n49%  of  MSME  labor,  followed  by  small  (39%)  and  medium-sized  (12%)  enterprises.  MSMEs \ncontributed  26%  of  GDP  and  32%  to  employment.  While  sole  proprietorships  display  low \nproductivity with an annual output per worker of $3,170 equivalent in 2015, their significance in \nproviding  subsistence  income  especially  in  rural  areas  highlights  their  importance  as  social \nprotection for low-income households. With an annual output per worker of $27,000, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are important for employment and income-generation. \n \n6. \nA  World  Economic  Forum  business  survey  identified  corruption,  inadequate  skills,  and \npoor access to finance as major obstacles to competitiveness. The performance of the banking \nsystem  is  undermined  by  corruption,  bureaucracy,  related-party  transactions,  poor  corporate \ngovernance,  and  imprudent  lending,  as  witnessed  by  the  very  poor  asset  quality  of  banks.9 \nLimited access to finance is a key obstacle to stronger productivity by MSMEs.10  \n \n7. \nWhile MSMEs contributed 26% to GDP in 2015, loans to MSMEs represented only 9.8% \nof GDP. Especially micro and small enterprises have insufficient documentation, credit history, \nand  property  titles  to  satisfy  bank  requirements.  The  banks\u2019  lending  policies  do  not  focus \nenough  on  estimated  business  cash  flows  when  assessing  borrowers\u2019  creditworthiness.  The \nhigh  cost  of  originating  loans  and  the  recent  history  of  poor  credit  underwriting  led  to  high \nperceived  risk  in  lending  to  small  businesses  and  to  high  lending  rates  that  make  borrowers\u2019 \ninvestments unattractive.11 Only 19% of MSMEs have received a bank loan, so most fund their \ninvestments through retained earnings, and borrowings from family and friends (footnote 9). \n \nThe  performance  of  the  finance  sector  mirrors  that  of  the  economy.  Economic  shocks, \n8. \npoor  credit  underwriting,  and  currency  devaluations  have  hurt  the  performance  and  stability  of \nthe banks and eroded public confidence. In 2011\u20132013, the loan book expressed in dollar terms \ngrew  by  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  (CAGR)  of  10.9%,  medium-sized  loans  surged  at  a \nCAGR of 119.0%, and deposits grew at a moderate CAGR of 7.7%. In this period, profitability \nimproved  from  a  negative  return  on  assets  to  a  positive  one  of  1.8%,  and  capital  adequacy \nmodestly  improved  to  18.7%.  Asset  quality,  however,  remained  extremely  poor  and  the \nnonperforming  loans  ratio  exceeded  30%  in  2013.  While  banks\u2019  nonperforming  loans  ratio \nreportedly  improved  to  8%  in  2015  as  a  result  of  write-offs  and  massive  transfers  to  special \npurpose  vehicles,  doubts  about  the  banks\u2019  asset  valuation  practices  suggest  that  the  reported \nimprovement  of  asset  quality  is  overstated  and  that  asset  quality  may  drop  again  under  the \n\n                                                 \n7  World Bank.

The government classifies enterprises by the number of workers and by income. \nIn  2016,  microenterprises  have  an  annual  income  up  to  $184,000  equivalent  or  up  to  15  employees;  small \nbusinesses  have less  than 100  employees  and  up  to $1.8 million  annual  income;  and medium-sized  businesses \nhave less than 250 employees and up to $18.4 million annual income. \n\n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 World  Bank  and  International  Finance  Corporation.  2014.  Enterprise  Surveys:  Kazakhstan  Country  Profile  2013. \nWashington  DC;  World  Economic  Forum.  2014.  The  Global  Competitiveness  Report,  2015\u20132016.  Geneva;  and \nWorld Bank. 2016. Doing Business 2016: Measuring Regulatory Quality and Efficiency. Washington DC. \n\n11 Bank annual lending rates in tenge range from 14% to 25%, and those in foreign currency range from 5% to 12%. \n\n\fcurrent economic decline.12 \n \n9. \nThe sharp devaluation of the tenge against the dollar (footnote 5) seriously affected the \nsolvency and profitability of some banks, including systemically important banks. Expressed in \ndollar  terms,  bank  loans  contracted  by  a  CAGR  of  27.3%,  and  loans  to  micro  and  small \nenterprises declined by a CAGR of 14.7% during 2014\u20132015. As a result, the banking system\u2019s \ndepth, expressed by the ratio of private sector credit to GDP, remained at a low 38% in 2015. \n \nIn 2015, banks were moderately capitalized, with a total capital adequacy ratio of 15.9%. \n10. \nWhile  exceeding  the  regulatory  minimum  of  7.5%,  banking  system  solvency  remains  highly \nsusceptible to the volatile economy and unresolved asset quality issues. The stress tests carried \nout  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  in  the  context  of  the  financial  sector  assessment \nprogram conducted in early 2014 showed that the capital of many banks would not be able to \nsufficiently  absorb  shocks  of  the  magnitude  witnessed  in  2014  and  in  2015.13 The  significant \nvolume of nonperforming loans will require write-offs and loan loss provisions over an extended \nperiod, and low net interest margins will limit banks\u2019 ability to generate additional capital through \nretained earnings. Additional capital will likely be needed to meet Basel III requirements, which \nare being phased in by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) from 2015 to 2019. \n \n11. \nHigh exchange rate volatility resulted in a surge of deposit dollarization from 35% (2010) \nto  70%  (2015),  while  local  currency  loans  represented  66%  of  loans  in  2015.  This  led  to \nsubstantial open foreign currency positions. Banks\u2019 lending in local currency was constrained by \nthe  NBK\u2019s  monetary  policy  and  measures  to  counter  currency  speculation.  In  2014  and  2015, \nthe  NBK  provided  cross-currency  swaps  up  to  12  months.  Tenge  funding  is  essential  to  help \nreduce currency-related risks of financial institutions and their borrowers. \n \n12. \nGovernment\u2019s strategy. Recognizing their significance for employment, innovation, and \nnon-oil  economic  growth,  the  government  is  supporting  MSMEs.  The  national  development \nstrategy Kazakhstan 2050 targets to increase the contribution of SMEs to GDP to 50% by 2020. \nThe  Roadmap  for  Business  2020,  Employment  Roadmap  2020,  and  the  State  Program  of \nIndustrial  and  Innovative  Development  (2015\u20132019)  contain  measures  for  MSME  support. 14 \nLack of access to finance is identified as a key constraint to MSME growth. The government has \nin  place  several  programs  to  support  SME  finance  along  with  development  partners.15 Those \nprograms  are  implemented  through  Damu,  a  government-owned  agency  mandated  to  provide \nloans  and  guarantees  to  MSMEs  via  financial  intermediaries  on  commercial  and  concessional \nterms.16 \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition. The project will provide loans for MSMEs and support financial \ninclusion,  especially  outside  the  two  major  cities,  by  providing  funds  for  working  capital  and \ninvestment  loans.  Access  to  finance  for  businesses  owned  by  women  is  encouraged  through \nagreed lending targets and gender policies. To meet these objectives, the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  carefully  selected  PFIs  that  (i)  have  a  significant  regional  footprint,  (ii)  have  top \n\n                                                 \n12 \u201cNonperforming  loans\u201d  should  be  interpreted  with  caution:  rescheduled  loans  are  not  reported  as  nonperforming \n\nloans.  \n\n13 International Monetary Fund. 2014.

Critical  elements  of  the  ADB \npackage are (i) the provision of local currency loans to address foreign exchange risks of PFIs \nand its borrowers, (ii) partnership with suitable PFIs that compete in servicing MSMEs through \ndifferent  approaches,  and  (iii)  TA  to  strengthen  the  PFIs\u2019  credit  risk  management  and  their \nproduct offerings for MSMEs. \n \n14. \nADB  sector  experience  and  assistance  program.  Prior  to  the  2008  crisis,  ADB  had \nprovided  nonsovereign  loans  and  partial  credit  guarantees  to  four  banks. 17  Since  2010,  it \nprovided sovereign loans through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) for SMEs via banks in \nan  aggregate  amount  of  $500  million  equivalent.18 The  facility  is  expected  to  close  in  2017. \nWhile a countercyclical support facility in 2015 helped mitigate the economic shock, the project \ndesign  reflects  the  need  for  extended  support  to  the  private  sector  (footnote  9).  Lessons  from \nthe MFF are embedded in the design of this project. First, while the MFF provided local currency \nto mitigate dollarization of loans to the banks and their customers, the swap instruments had to \nbe originated and repaid in bullet payments that were inadequate to match PFI funding needs. \nADB will now provide tenge through NBK, allowing periodic withdrawals through separate repo \ntransactions  that  fit  PFI  funding  needs. 19  Second,  the  project  will  also  cover  low-income \nmicroenterprise  borrowers  through  the  participation  of  microfinance  organizations  and  TA  to \nsupport  PFIs  in  servicing  microenterprises.  Third,  a  larger  number  of  PFIs,  the  flexibility  to \ninclude  additional  PFIs during  project  implementation,  and  allocation  of funds  based  on  actual \ndisbursement  performance  will  stimulate  PFI  competition.  Finally,  a  longer  implementation \nperiod provides flexibility to accommodate demand fluctuation in a volatile environment. \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \n15. \nDevelopment, the International Finance Corporation, the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, and the World Bank support MSMEs through (i) business development services, \n(ii)  assistance  in  introducing  credit  scoring  and  improving  lending  technology,  (iii)  cluster \ndevelopment,  and  (iv)  loans  and  equity  investments  in  banks.  ADB  is  coordinating  with  these \npartners  and  focuses  on  mitigating  currency  risk  and  improving  PFIs\u2019  service  outreach  to \nMSMEs (footnote 15). \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nThe  impact  will  be  a  sustained  contribution  of  MSMEs  to  Kazakhstan\u2019s  GDP,  which  is \naligned with the government\u2019s objectives of supporting entrepreneurship and the contribution of \nMSMEs to the non-oil economy and employment under a challenging macro environment. The \noutcome will be that a sustainable provision of loans to MSMEs is maintained. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Alliance  Bank  (2006,  $100  million  partial  credit  guarantee  and  $50  million  loan);  Bank  CenterCredit  (2007, \nT6 billion  loan);  BTA  Bank  (2006,  $75  million  loan);  and  Kazkommertsbank  (2007,  $100  million  partial  credit \nguarantee). The loans to BTA Bank and Alliance were restructured and partly written off. \n\n18 ADB.  2010.

The  project  will  fund  local  currency  loans \nto  MSMEs,  enable  productive \nthrough  PFIs \ninvestments  by  MSMEs,  and  incentivize  lending  to  women  entrepreneurs  and \nregions  outside  Astana  and  Almaty.  20 The  PFIs  will  aim  to  fund  at  least  (a) \n$50 million  equivalent  to  women-owned  businesses,  with  a  third  of  the  total \nnumber of subborrowers being women; and (b) $120 million equivalent to eligible \nsubborrowers outside the cities of Astana and Almaty. \nImproved efficiency of PFIs\u2019 lending to MSMEs. The project will provide TA to \nimprove  credit  risk  management  and  efficiency of selected  PFIs,  and  to  expand \nfinancing opportunities for MSMEs. \n\n(ii) \n\n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $240 million equivalent. The government has requested \n18. \na loan of T72 billion (equivalent to $200 million) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the project. ADB will provide tenge through an innovative funding facility with the NBK, \nunder which NBK and ADB will execute repo transactions as required to accommodate the PFIs\u2019 \ndemand for funding to MSMEs (footnote 19). Damu will be the borrower of the loan, which will \nbe guaranteed by the Republic of Kazakhstan. The final maturity date of the loan will match the \ntermination date of the NBK\u2019s liquidity facility. The loan will have (i) an interest rate equal to the \nsum of ADB\u2019s cost of funding21 and the contractual spread for sovereign guaranteed loans; (ii) a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year on committed and undisbursed amounts commencing 60 \ncalendar days after the date of the loan agreement; and (iii) such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan, guarantee, and project agreements. The loan tenor will be 36 months. \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \nSubborrowers (through equity contribution) \n\nTotal \n\nAmount ($ million) \n \n200.0 \n40.0 \n240.0 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n83.3 \n16.7 \n100.0 \n\nNote: Every $1.00 of an Asian Development Bank subloan is expected to mobilize, on average, an additional $0.20 \nof  business  investment  on  the  assumption  that  the  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  will  require  eligible \nborrowers to provide on average 16.7% of a subproject\u2019s cost with equity. PFIs will have discretion to determine the \nsubborrower  equity  contributions  based  on  the  nature  of  the  credit  risk.  Although  not  part  of  the  PFIs\u2019 \ndisbursements  to  subborrowers,  the  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan  requires  the  PFIs  to  hold  $0.075  of  capital  for \neach $1.000 they onlend under the project. The equity capital and loan loss reserves are the first defenses against \nany subborrower payment defaults and ensure that the PFIs are incentivized to lend to creditworthy clients. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates, Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund, and PFIs. \n\n \n19. \nDamu  will  relend  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  qualified  PFIs  that  meet  agreed  selection \ncriteria,  and  pursuant  to  subsidiary  loan  agreements  entered  into  by  Damu  and  each  PFI,  on \nterms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.

Qualified PFIs will be the implementing agencies.23 A project \nmanagement  unit  at  Damu  will  administer  the  project,  provide  progress reports,  oversee  PFIs\u2019 \ncompliance with ADB loan and project agreements, and manage any issues in coordination with \nADB  and  the  PFIs.  The  PFIs  are  expected  to  report  the  utilization  of  funds  through  loans  to \nqualified MSMEs, covering the first and recurrent uses of funds until final maturity of the Damu \nsubsidiary  loans  to  PFIs.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  2  and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).24 \n \n21. \nGiven the volume of trade flows with non-ADB members and the relatively small size of \nindividual  transactions,  a  waiver  to  allow  MSMEs  to  procure  goods,  works,  and  consulting \nservices from non-ADB member countries is requested from the ADB Board of Directors.25 \n \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii) \n\nImplementing agencies \n\nRetroactive financing \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2017\u2013June 2019 \n30 June 2019 \n30 June 2019 \n\nDamu Entrepreneurship Development Fund \nQualified PFIs: Asian Credit Fund (microfinance organization), Bank of \nAstana, Bank CenterCredit, Bank Kassa Nova, Bereke (microfinance \norganization), KazMicroFinance (microfinance organization), and Nurbanka \nUp to 20% of the loan amount can be used to finance eligible subloans \nmade by PFIs on or after the approval of the project by the ADB Board of \nDirectors and prior to the loan effectiveness date, but no earlier than 12 \nmonths before the signing date of the loan agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB, including a \nminimum drawdown amount of $20 million. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFI = participating financial institution. \na  Additional PFIs could be considered during project implementation, provided they meet the eligibility criteria for \nthe project and appropriate financial, safeguard, and integrity due diligence is conducted on each candidate. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nCapacity development TA for Strengthening MSME Finance will help improve the credit \n22. \nrisk  management  of  selected  PFIs  and  expand  financing  opportunities  for  MSMEs.  ADB  will \nengage with Damu and selected PFIs in providing customized solutions to upgrade PFIs\u2019 credit \n\n                                                 \n22 At  the  end  of  2015,  this  was  8,000  times  the  monthly  calculation  index  (set  annually  in  the  Budget  Law), \n\n23 A description of the PFIs preliminarily selected for the project is included in the Financial Analysis (accessible from \n\ni.e., T17 million (equivalent to $46,000). \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n24 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 The ADB Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote representing not less than two-thirds of the total \nvoting  power  of  the  members  of  the  Board.  The  Board  approved  a  similar  waiver  for  the  ongoing  MFF  that  is \nsupporting SME financing in Kazakhstan (see footnote 18). \n\n\forigination and management, and efficiency of service outreach to MSMEs.26 The TA output will \nbe  improved  capacities  of  the  PFIs  to  better  serve  MSMEs.  To  improve  the  sustainability  of \nADB\u2019s  credit  line,  the  TA  will  assist  the  PFIs  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  institutional \ndevelopment\u2014including  market  analysis,  organizational  set  up,  introduction  of  new  lending \ntechniques,  and  product  development  and  testing\u2014to  support  banks  in  downscaling  their \nlending operations to the smaller segments and development of new products for microfinance \norganizations;  (ii)  greater  efficiency  of  the  lending  process  and  management  of  corporate \ngovernance  and  risk  issues;  and  (iii)improvement  of  internal  audit  functions.  Given  the  limited \nTA  resources,  and  to  increase  the  impact  of  the  intervention,  the  support  will  be  provided \nindividually  to  a  limited  number  of  PFIs,  which  have  confirmed  management  commitment  to \nintroduce  innovations  that  are  scalable  and  can  demonstrate  improvements  in  reaching  to  the \ntarget groups (smaller businesses, rural areas, women entrepreneurs).   \n \n23. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1  million,  of  which  $500,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant \nbasis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Special  Fund  (footnote  1)  and \nadministered by ADB. The PFIs will fund no less than 35% of each individual TA cost. The TA \nwill  be  implemented  over  30  months.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  with  the \nCentral and West Asia Department acting as the focal point. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nSustaining access to finance in a volatile macroeconomic environment positively affects \nMSMEs\u2019  ability  to  maintain  their  operations,  selectively  invest  in  productive  technologies,  and \ngrow  their  businesses  to  reach  economies  of  scale,  thereby  contributing  to  economic  stability, \ndiversification away from the oil economy, and preservation of jobs. \n \nADB  and  Damu  selected  four  banks  and  three  microfinance  organizations  as  PFIs \n25. \nwhose business strategies and performance provide a good fit with the project objectives. Most \nPFIs have significant MSME lending operations in the regions outside Almaty and Astana, i.e., \nmore than half of their loan books. Bank CenterCredit (BCC), a leading lender to SMEs with a \nvery strong branch network, serves more than 2,500 small enterprise borrowers with an average \nloan  size  of  $80,000.  ADB  is  familiar  with  BCC  through  the  MFF  since  2012.  BCC  displays  a \nreasonable financial performance, and acceptable risk profiles and corporate governance. Bank \nKassa  Nova,  recently  transformed  from  a  microfinance  organization  into  a  bank  that  retains  a \nstrong microbusiness focus, serves more than 3,100 clients for an average loan size of $30,000 \nequivalent. Bank of Astana (BOA) and Nurbank are smaller banks that recently began to target \nthe  MSME  segment.  BOA  has  370 MSME  clients,  with  an  average  loan  size  of  $90,000. \nNurbank has 800 SMEs as borrowers with an average loan size of $51,000. Nurbank and BOA \nhave  managements  that  display  strong  commitment  to  expanding  the  MSME  business.27 The \nparticipating  microfinance  organizations\u2014KazMicroFinance,  Asian  Credit  Fund  (ACF),  and \nBereke\u2014lend  almost  exclusively  in  rural  areas  and  work  well  with  women  borrowers. \nKazMicroFinance has over 151,000 borrowers with an average loan size of $682. ACF serves \n15,000  borrowers  with  an  average  loan  size  of  $375.  Bereke  has  4,215  borrowers  with  an \naverage  loan  size  of  $945.  Competition  between  lenders  that  use  different  strategies  and \ndistribution channels benefit the financing of small businesses. \n \n\n                                                 \n26 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nADB carried out due diligence on each PFI and was satisfied with their ability to assess \n26. \nthe  creditworthiness  of  each  MSME  subloan  and  determine  the  commercial  terms  of  the \nsubloan  based  on  their  risk  profile.28 Damu\u2019s  capabilities  to  manage  the  borrowed  funds  and \ncomply with monitoring and reporting requirements are considered appropriate, as shown under \nprevious  ADB  projects, and  will  be  further  enhanced  with  additional  Damu  staff to  monitor the \nimplementation of the project. Financial due diligence indicated that, within the given high-risk-\ncountry  environment,  the  PFIs  are  exposed  to  significant  risks,  given  their  modest  capital \nadequacy,  poor  asset  quality,  and  weak  profitability.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  ADB  will  closely \nmonitor  compliance  of  PFIs  with  the  eligibility  criteria  in  each  disbursement  and  throughout \nimplementation.29 Additional PFIs that satisfy agreed eligibility criteria may participate. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  requirements  on  financial \nmanagement, reporting and auditing, and environmental and social safeguards were explained \nto and discussed with Damu and the PFIs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s financial management and integrity due diligence on Damu and each PFI indicate \nmoderate  risks.  Damu\u2019s  capabilities  are  considered  adequate.  However,  as  a  government-\nowned institution, Damu\u2019s independence is somewhat affected by the direct influence of higher \ngovernment authorities. Integrity due diligence on Damu and the PFIs included the identification \nof ultimate beneficial ownership and presence of politically exposed persons, which was suitably \ndisclosed,  and  any  issues  were  managed  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction.30 All  PFIs  meet  ADB\u2019s  anti-\nmoney-laundering due diligence requirements. The PFIs\u2019 boards of directors and management \nboards  are  composed  of  experienced  professionals.  Internal  controls  are  generally  well \nestablished, including independent internal audit units that carry out risk-based audits and report \ndirectly to the supervisory boards.31 All banks have credit risk functions independent from credit \norigination.  All  PFIs  are  regulated  by  the  NBK  and  prepare  annual  financial  statements  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, audited by reputable audit firms. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe country\u2019s strong economic growth between 2010 and 2013 has reduced the poverty \nrate to 2.8% (2014) and the unemployment rate to 5% (2015).32 However, the rural poverty rate \nremains significant  at  4.9%,  and the  current macroeconomic  instability  will  potentially  increase \n\n                                                 \n28 NBK has established as a condition for providing tenge liquidity for this project that the maximum onlending rate to \nsmall and medium-sized subborrowers be not above the sum of (i) half the NBK\u2019s policy rate or 7%, whichever is \nhigher; and (ii) 8%. As of September 2016, this limit would be 15%, which is in line with market practices. This limit \ndoes not apply to lending done by microfinance organizations, which cannot provide loans over $50,000. \n\n29 Key  selection  criteria  for  PFIs  are  (i)  compliance  with  NBK\u2019s  prudential  regulations,  adequate  asset  quality,  and \nprofitability; (ii) business strategies for and track record of serving MSMEs; (iii) presence of an environmental and \nsocial  management  system  that  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  national  laws,  and  appointment  of \ndesignated  staff  to  screen  prospective  subprojects;  and  (iv)  preparation  of  complete  financial  statements  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, externally audited based on International Standards \nof Auditing. Financial Analysis and Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n\n30 Integrity  due  diligence  identified  politically  exposed  people in  the  ownership structure and  management board of \n\nKassa Nova Bank. ADB\u2019s integrity due diligence has classified the risks as low. \n\n31 ACF (microfinance organization) has a lower internal audit capacity and relies on the support of an internal audit \n\nteam from Kompanion, a Mercy Corps subsidiary based in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n32 National Statistics Office of Kazakhstan. \n\n\fpoverty. Farmers and MSMEs, especially in the regions, will provide a buffer to such impacts by \nproviding subsistence income and employment.33 \n \n30. \nAt  68%,  women\u2019s  labor  force  participation  is  below  that  of  men  (78%).  Women  also \nrepresent a higher share of the unemployed (57% in 2015).34 An ADB survey carried out in 2015 \nfound  that  58%  of  surveyed  microenterprises  owned  by  women  had  annual  sales  of  up  to \n$10,000, and focused on services (34%), trade (33%), and manufacturing (20%), mainly in food \nand  garments.  This  highlights  the  significance  of  microfinance  for  female  entrepreneurs. \nEncouraging  women  entrepreneurship  helps  broaden  the  base  for  economic  growth  and \nprovides  employment  and  income  opportunities  for  women  and  their  families.  The  project  is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming because it is expected to contribute to women\u2019s \nempowerment through the actions described in the gender action plan and the targets set in the \ndesign and monitoring framework. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nSubprojects will comply with Kazakh labor, environmental, health, safety, and social laws \n31. \nand regulations, as well as safeguard policies in para. 29 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The project is categorized as financial intermediary with respect to environment and as \nfinancial  intermediary  (treated  as  C)  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. \nSubprojects  will  not  be  eligible  for  ADB  financing  if  they  (i)  appear  on  ADB\u2019s  Prohibited \nInvestment Activities List, or (ii) have involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples impacts, or \nare  classified  as  environment  category  A.  As  for  environment,  PFIs  may  either  (i)  exclude  all \nprojects with environmental impacts that exceed category C,35 or (ii) permit subprojects that are \nclassified B and C. ADB will require PFIs to maintain an environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) that complies with ADB\u2019s requirements and national laws, and have designated \nstaff  trained  in  implementing  the  ESMS  to  screen  prospective  subprojects,  as  a  condition  to \nparticipate  in  this  project.36 PFIs  and  Damu  will  provide  to  ADB  semiannual  ESMS  monitoring \nreports during implementation. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.37 Some  significant  risks  are  related  to  the \nvolatile economic operating environment and can only be partly mitigated through the project as \ndescribed.  However,  ADB\u2019s  position  is  protected  by  the  strong  credit  of  the  sovereign,  which \nguarantees  the  loan.  The  project  is  categorized  as  low  risk  because  (i)  the  size  of  the  loan \namount  does  not  exceed  $200  million,  (ii)  ADB  and  Damu  have  adequate  mechanisms  to \noversee  the  performance  of  PFIs  and  experience  in  supporting  MSMEs  in  Kazakhstan,  and \n(iii) Damu has a solid track record in managing ADB\u2019s and other externally funded projects. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n33 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  and  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Finance  (accessible  from \n\n34 Kazakhstan  ranks  47th  out  of  145  countries  in  the  Gender  Gap  Index  2015.

The Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund now has \nmore experience in handling these internal procedures (based on earlier \nADB and other development partner projects). \nThe government is implementing countercyclical support measures to \nsustain growth and employment, and improve the environment for micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises. \nProject design allows for longer implementation period, thereby \naccommodating demand fluctuation. \nPFIs adjust lending limits and security requirements, and increasingly \ndenominate loans in tenge. \nThe National Bank of Kazakhstan is gradually tightening prudential \nregulations toward Basel III, which will require additional capital injections \nby bank shareholders. \nADB will closely monitor eligibility of PFIs during disbursement. Loan \ntenor is limited to 36 months and guaranteed by the government. \nADB will closely monitor the eligibility of PFIs during disbursement. \nTechnical assistance will support customized efforts of PFIs to improve \nunderwriting and risk management. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFI = participating financial institution. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund, and National Bank of Kazakhstan. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n33. \nDamu  and  the  PFIs  have  assured  ADB  that  the  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34. \nDamu  and the  PFIs  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants for  the project,  which \nare  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.
