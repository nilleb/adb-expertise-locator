THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Kingdom of Bhutan for subprogram 3 of the Financial Market Development \nProgram. \n \n2.  The program supports key policy reforms designed to address finance sector deficiencies \nin terms of institutions, markets and products, vulnerabilities caused by inadequate risk-based \nsupervision, concentration of risk, and insufficient inclusiveness.1 The programmatic approach \n0F\naligned support to key government reform programs over the medium to long-term to (i) increase \naccess to finance for the private sector through stronger markets and institutions, and (ii) improve \nfinancial inclusion to enable economic diversification efforts in Bhutan. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Board of Directors approved the programmatic approach, which was originally \ndesigned to comprise two subprograms totaling $60 million in loans for subprograms 1 and 2 ($30 \nmillion each). Subprogram 3 was proposed to the Board of Directors in October 2020 at the time \nof approval of subprogram 2. Subprogram 3 included important implementation of key policy \nareas achieved under subprograms 1 and 2 while introducing complementary areas to complete \npolicy reforms like corporate governance, improved risk performance by financial institutions and \nbuilding data integrity through robust mechanisms like data warehousing. Subprogram 3 was \nprocessed 6 months ahead of program completion in March 2022 to enable timely reforms, as \nrequired by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impact on financial markets. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Bhutan is a lower middle-income country with average per \ncapita income of $3,122 in  fiscal year (FY) 2020.2 Gross domestic product (GDP) growth \n1F\naveraged 6.7% over 3 decades ending in FY2019. Reduced economic activity curtailed GDP \ngrowth. A potential increase in tourism and the recommencement of projects that were stalled \nbecause of the departure of skilled workers from the country during the pandemic will help GDP \ngrow (Table 1). The fiscal gap over the 5-year period of FY2019\u2013FY2023 (estimated at $400 \nmillion) was revised to $530 million after COVID-19 pandemic. Significant deficits continue from \nFY2020 to FY2022.3 The fiscal deficit in FY2021 is almost exceeding the targeted 5% of GDP \n2F\nbecause of pandemic-related expenditure. There is an estimated increase in capital investment-\nrelated expenditure in FY2022. Although there was an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio, the non-\nhydropower-related debt of about 30% of GDP in March 2021 was well within the public debt \npolicy threshold of 35%.4  \n3F\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  Independent Evaluation Department (IED). 2019.

Fiscal deficit is usually analyzed \nexcluding hydro-power related debt due to low repayment risk of the power purchase agreements. \n \n ", "2 \nTable 1: Macroeconomic Indicators, FY2019\u2013FY2024 \n(%) \nItem  FY2019  FY2020  FY2021a  FY2022a  FY2023a  FY2024a \nGDP growth   4.3  (0.9)b  (3.4)b  3.7b  6.9  8.1 \nFiscal deficit/GDP  1.6  1.9  7.3  8.6  0.4  0.5 \nDebt/GDP  106.6  119.9  124.7  124.9  130.9  117.1 \nNon-hydro debt/GDP  24.4  30.1  31.6  32.7  29.7  26.4 \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: The FY ends on 30 June, e.g., FY2022 ends on 30 June 2022.  \na Estimate.  \nb Asian Development Bank.

The government\u2019s general macroeconomic policy has displayed a moderate risk with \nrising fiscal deficits due to COVID-19. The Public Finance Act, 2007 of Bhutan has laid out the \nfiscal process. The government's Twelfth Five Year Plan (FY2018\u20132023) focuses on national \npriorities for determining fiscal expenditure. The government has allocated one of the highest \ncapital budgets at 33% of the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2019\u20132023 (total plan is $530 million) for \nFY2021\u2013FY2022.  Proposed  simplification  of  the  import  tax  structure  would  enable  better \ncoverage and compliance, improving the fiscal position. Monetary policy measures to mitigate the \nimpact of COVID-19 (e.g., reduced interest rates and debt moratoriums) are still in force, although \nthe Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) will be looking to end these concessions by the end of 2022. \n \n5.  Development  problems.  Most  of  Bhutan\u2019s  population  lives  in  rural  areas  that  are \nvulnerable to climate-related hazards and where employment opportunities are limited. 5 The \n4F\nnational poverty rate decreased from 23.0% in 2007 to 8.2% in 2017, but it is expected to have \ndeteriorated during the period of COVID-19-related lockdowns. Bhutan\u2019s economy is mainly \ndriven by the state sector, with high reliance on hydropower exports. Economic diversification \nremains low. The government has prioritized private sector development to drive and diversify the \neconomy and create employment. The private sector is dominated by microenterprises and sole \nproprietorships with relatively low access to formal finance and low skill level and innovation. \nCOVID-19 exposed the inadequate access to finance and collateral-based lending practices by \nbanks, which result in reduced private sector participation in the economy. COVID-19-related \nlockdowns and the absence of tourism resulted in unemployment increasing to 5.0% in 2020 from \n1.8% in 2019.6 \n5F\n \n6.  Impact of the coronavirus disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has dampened growth \nprospects. The government\u2019s fiscal expenditure increased because of measures provided to \ncombat the adverse impacts of the pandemic; budget support to provide essential items while \nfiscal income reduced due to deferment of sales and import taxes, rent payments by tourist sector \nbusinesses, and electricity charges by industries. The services sector, which comprised 43.4% \nof GDP in 2019, contributed 40.6% in 2020. The sector\u2019s growth rate decreased to 7.9% in 2020 \nfrom 12.5% in 2019.7 A decline of international tourist arrivals by 35.0% reduced tourism revenue \n6F\nby 33.9% in 2020. The industry sector contracted by 1.1% in 2021, with declines in construction \nand manufacturing sectors because of migrant labor shortages, disruptions in supply of raw \n \n5  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6 The  women\u2019s unemployment  rate  increased  from  3.3%  in  2019  to  6.0%  in  2020  (compared  to  the  men\u2019s \nunemployment rate, which increased from 2.2% in 2019 to 4.1% in 2020). The overall youth unemployment rate \nincreased from 11.9% in 2019 to 22.6% in 2020, with that of girls increasing from 13.8% in 2019 to 25.4% in 2020 \nand that of boys increasing from 9.7% in 2019 to 19.2% in 2020. These data indicate the stronger economic effect of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic on women and youth. https://www.nsb.gov.bt/publications/labour-force-survey-report/. \n7  Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Finance (MOF). 2021. National Budget, Financial Year 2021\u201322. Thimphu. \n ", "3 \nmaterials, and low domestic demand. Post-COVID-19 fiscal deficits are expected to widen \nbecause of reduced revenue to the government from tourism royalties, income, and sales taxes. \nUnder a longer containment scenario of the pandemic, Bhutan is expected to lose $142 million of \nGDP, with tourism losses estimated at $78 million.8 \n7F\n \n7.  Finance sector context. The sector is limited, with a concentration in regulation and a \ndominance of banks. Bhutan\u2019s financial system comprises five banks, two insurance companies, \nand five microfinance institutions. The RMA includes the electronic clearing house, the financial \ninclusion secretariat, the consumer protection cell, and the central registry. The system also \ncomprises  the  credit  information  bureau,  the  Bhutan  electronic  clearing  house,  the  Royal \nSecurities Exchange of Bhutan (RSEB [also acts as the Central depository]), the Office of the \nRegistrar of Companies, Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Bhutan Accounting Standards Board, \nand the Royal Audit Authority. The RMA regulates all financial institutions, including pension and \nprovident funds and microfinance institutions, and fintech service providers in addition to the \nRSEB. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector has been growing rapidly, as reflected in measures on market \ndepth such as the increase in credit to the private sector, which went from 15.4% in 2005 to 67.9% \nin December 2020. Banks provided 75.0% of credit to the economy as of December 2020. \nNonperforming loan ratios (NPLs) rose to 14.6% in December 2020 (10.9% in December 2019). \nMarket capitalization was 26.4% of GDP in December 2020. The corporate bond market is still \nilliquid despite the first government bond issuance in 2020 under subprogram 2. The RSEB had \nregistered 13 corporate bonds worth Nu6.9 billion as of December 2020. \n \n8.  Binding  constraints.  Finance  sector  constraints,  which  impede  the  financial \nintermediation process, include (i) underdeveloped nonbank financial institutions and markets, (ii) \ndeficient financial infrastructure and lack of capacity at banks, and (iii) the combined effects of \nlow financial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. Removing these constraints would \npromote  well-functioning  financial  markets,  including  strong  institutions,  transparent  legal \nstructures, and rules and regulations that cater to the latest requirements of electronic commerce. \nThis would help improve financial inclusion, which affects more women than men, and mobilize \ndomestic resources to meet development needs and achieve economic diversification. \n  \n9.  Significant risks to the banking sector. The banking segment is thinly capitalized, \nalthough capital is above the regulatory threshold of 10%. Loan asset quality has steadily \ndeteriorated because of aggressive credit expansion during 2013\u20132019. By June 2020, NPL ratio \n(nonperforming loans to total loans) rose to 16.3% because of the pandemic from 15.0% in June \n2019 as micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises struggled to meet debt repayments. In \nDecember 2020, NPLs had declined to 11% due to moratorium on loan repayments introduced \nby banks because of monetary measures introduced by the RMA.9 Weakening capital buffers \n8F\nwith high NPLs, even prior to the pandemic, weigh on banks\u2019 profitability, despite an increase in \nnet profit after tax in March 2021 on the back of wider interest margins and loan growth. Expertise \nat financial institutions in restructuring  NPLs and strengthening credit underwriting skills  is \nurgently required. Banks have asset and liability mismatches because of borrowings through \nshort-term deposits and lending on long-term assets. These were mitigated by a high current and \nsavings account composition of 52% of total deposits as of December 2020. \n \n10.  Risk exposure of nonbank financial institutions. Bhutan\u2019s nonbank financial system \nconsists of five microfinance institutions, two insurance companies, and one superannuation fund. \nThe insurance sector is permitted to extend credit because of the nonavailability of alternative \n \n8  ADB. Data Library: COVID-19 Economic Impact Assessment Template (accessed 12 August 2021). \n9  RMA. https://www.rma.org.bt/news/Phase%202/Monetary%20Measures.pdf (accessed September 28 2021) \n \n ", "4 \ninvestments.  Insurance  companies  follow  similar  regulations  to  banks  in  extending  credit. \nInsurance sector NPL ratio was 22.2% in December 2020, within the overall NPL ratio of 11.0% \nin the finance sector. The insurance sector requires immediate capital strengthening to absorb \npossible credit losses from NPLs and contain its impact on the broader financial system. Moving \nthe insurance sector away from credit operations would be a necessary long-term measure as \ncapital markets develop and alternative investments increase. RMA issued solvency regulations \nfor the first time in 2019 on life insurance portfolios. The solvency ratio on life insurance stood at \n25% in December 2019 but improved to 68% in December 2020 (still below the minimum \nrequirement of 100%). The improvement in 2020 was because of the accounting treatment under \nrevised RMA regulations on insurance risk requirements. The insurance sector is expected to \ncomply with the regulatory ratio by 2022. The growth in the life insurance category will continue \nto increase risks as the sector extends credit using the life insurance funds. Risks will be mitigated \nby complying with solvency requirements. The non-life insurance portfolio and reinsurance \nportfolios  are  comparatively  less  in  volume  than  life  insurance.10 In  addition,  a  focus  on \n9F\nimprovement in the reinsurance business, with risk-based pricing based on actuarial valuation, \nneeds to be in place to address the sector\u2019s profitability and sustainability. \n \n11.  Housing sector concentration. Bank lending relied heavily on housing loans before \n2012. Housing loans comprised 27.4% of finance sector credit as of December 2020.11 A housing \n10F\nmarket demand survey was conducted in March 2021 to identify the demographics of housing \nfinance requirements in the congested urban areas in Bhutan; this survey will be used to formulate \nstrategies by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlements and the RMA. The results of this \nsurvey showed a declining rate of homeownership, an increase in rental housing and occupation \nof substandard housing units, and a high rent burden for low-income households. Significant \nefforts are required to facilitate access to affordable housing and promote homeownership.12 \n11F\n \n12.  Nascent shallow capital markets. Debt capital markets benefited through the issuance \nof Treasury bonds (under subprogram 2) amounting to Nu3.7 billion with 3-year and 10-year \nmaturities and fixed coupon rates.13 Investors of these bonds are mostly insurance companies \n12F\nand pension funds followed by banks and other institutional investors. Mandatory listing of all \ngovernment bonds in the future would incentivize more investors to enter the market. Equity \nmarkets are expected to continue to slow down in 2021 because of the continued adverse effects \nof COVID-19; market capitalization decreased by 7.70% from Nu51.41 billion in 2019 to Nu47.45 \nbillion in 2020 because of lower prices and the delisting of two mining companies. In 2020, the \ncapital market experienced a decrease of 22.89% in the value of shares and only 2 out of 19 \nlisted companies (three companies were removed from the list in 2020) paid dividends to their \nshareholders; in 2019, 8 out of 22 listed companies paid dividends. There were no initial public \nofferings for fundraising in 2020. \n \n13.  Developing the financial infrastructure. The RMA and the RSEB need to build their \ncapacity to make surveillance more efficient. Gradually reducing concentration of regulation at \n \n10 Insurance companies invest in loans. Earlier solvency was calculated on gross loans, although significant loan loss \nprovisions have already been made. Revised regulations require solvency to be calculated on net loans. \n11 Middle- and lower-income urban households spend an estimated 40%\u201260% of their disposable income on rent \nbecause of lack of affordable housing. Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2017. Bhutan Living \nStandards Survey Report 2017. Thimphu. \n12 The Urban Water Group of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department is processing a project on housing finance with the National \nHousing Development Corporation of Bhutan to promote affordable housing supply for low-income households, with \na focus on gender. ADB. Bhutan: Green and Resilient Affordable Housing Sector Project. \n13 The Government of Bhutan issued a 3-year bond for Nu3 billion at a coupon rate of 6.5% in September 2020 and a \n10-year bond for Nu700 million at a coupon rate of 3.98% in February 2021. \n ", "5 \nthe RMA and delegating to other related entities like the RSEB and establishing a separate cell \non insurance within the RMA with reporting lines to a different authority would lead to stronger \ninstitutions. To this end, the RMA has developed a data warehousing policy under subprogram \n3. A lack of underwriting capacity and credit rating institutions prevents the supply of funds to the \nmarkets. In its fourth follow-up report to the 2016 mutual evaluation report on Bhutan, the \nAsia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering rated the country\u2019s effectiveness low, both for the \nregulator (the RMA) and financial institutions\u2019 compliance with anti-money laundering/combating \nthe financing of terrorism requirements based on improvements made after the introduction of the \nAnti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Act, 2018.14  \n13F\n \n14.  Low financial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. As of December 2020, \n76.1% of the adult population in Bhutan (of which 52.7% were men and 47.3% women) held \nsavings accounts. Only 21.8% of the adult population had access to credit (of which 57.2% were \nmen  and  42.8%  women).  This  is  partly  because  banks  still  assess  loan  requests against \ncollateral, rather than considering a borrower\u2019s financial viability. Similarly, only 25.3% of the adult \npopulation had life insurance, of which 59.6% were men and 40.4% women.15 Many rural \n14F\ncommunities lack access to formal remittance services.16 Therefore, the benefits of modern \n15F\nelectronic and online payment systems have yet to reach all, and cash still dominates the payment \nsystem.17 \n16F\n \n15.  Financial inclusion through institutions and digitalization. National CSI Development \nBank Ltd. was established on 22 February 2020, and the Tarayana Foundation launched the \nTarayana Micro Finance for Rural Development program to meet the financial needs of rural \ncommunities on 20 February 2020. Collective loan accounts in the country stood at 3,551 as of \nDecember 2020, an indication of the inherent challenges in the finance sector, which include lack \nof formal credit history, lack of collateral, and low financial literacy. Under subprogram 3, the use \nof innovative technology for inclusive finance through a sandboxing (cybersecurity practice where \ncodes are run, observed, and analyzed in a safe, isolated environment on a network) framework \nwas initiated by the RMA in 2020, which targets financial inclusion.18 \n17F\n \n16.  Government reform agenda. The government is committed to continue reforms to make \nthe finance sector more responsive to emerging priorities, while remaining stable and inclusive. \nThis support is critical for the government to achieve national key result areas of the Twelfth Five \nYear  Plan,  such  as  macroeconomic  stability,  economic  diversification,  improved  access  to \nfinance,  and  poverty  reduction.  In  2017,  the  government  approved  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Action Plan, which details reform actions that affect the banking system, nonbank \nfinancial institutions, financial inclusion, and financial literacy. The National Credit Guarantee \nScheme  was  launched  in  2020  as  a countercyclical  policy  measure  during  the  COVID-19 \npandemic to improve access to finance.

Subprogram 3 is included in ADB\u2019s Indicative Country Pipeline and Monitoring Report, \n2022\u20132024.19 The program is aligned with operational priority (OP) 1 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \n18F\n(addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities); OP2 (accelerating progress in gender \nequality), OP 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability); and OP 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity).20 \n19F\nSubprogram 3 was advanced by 6 months to enable reforms, particularly in the insurance sector, \nand NPLs of the financial system to be implemented as early as possible, given that the pandemic \nhas exacerbated issues in the finance sector. \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n18.  Risk-based surveillance introduced under reforms. The Macro-Prudential Regulations \nwere adopted in 2018. In 2019, risk management guidelines were issued by the RMA to provide \nminimum standards in risk mitigation at financial institutions and to encourage them to adopt and \nimplement a sound risk management framework.21 In addition, directives on risk-based solvency \n20F\nand capital requirements were issued by the RMA for insurance and reinsurance companies in \nBhutan in September 2019. \n \n19.  Policy reforms proposed through the program. Subprogram 1 laid the groundwork in \nterms of strategies and processes in the areas of capital markets, insurance, pensions, gradual \ncompliance  with  international  market  standards,  cybersecurity,  and  consumer  protection.22 \n21F\nSubprogram  2  followed  with  policies  developed  in  the  same  reform  areas  and  initial \noperationalization  of  international  market  standards  and  demand-side analysis  for financial \ninclusion. Subprogram 3 was introduced to add depth to reforms in areas like development of \ncapital markets through listing government bonds and revision of rules of cottage and small \nindustries sector equity issuers to add liquidity, insurance strategy including broadening the scope \nof insurance products and the number of providers, advance implementation of compliance with \ninternational  financial  market standards  (IFRS,  Basle  III)  and strengthened  integrity  of the \nfinancial system with better information management and use of digitalization for payment \nsystems for inclusion and efficiency. Subprogram 3 will maintain the reform momentum and \nintroduce new finance sector reforms like data warehousing to increase the accuracy and integrity \nof  data,  stress  testing of  insurance  business and  developing  a  green  taxonomy.  Reforms \nintroduced through subprograms 1 and 2 (i) helped start the government bond issuance; (ii) \nincreased bank deposits by 42% (from Nu117.18 billion in March 2019 to Nu141.7 billion in March \n2021); and (iii) exhibited growth in the private sector with increased market capitalization, financial \ninclusion (including life insurance), and expansion of private sector pensions and provident funds \nas evidenced by a 15.15% increase in membership (56,809 in 2019 to 65,414 in 2020).  \n \n20.

These are \npresented in detail in the government\u2019s Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3), Amendments \nand Additions to the Policy Matrix (Supplementary document 12) and the Policy Design and \nMonitoring Framework (Appendix 1). \n \n21.  Impact of subprogram 3 to mitigate the coronavirus disease effects on financial \nmarkets. Subprogram 3 addresses rising NPLs and reduced investment caused by lockdowns \nbecause of the pandemic. Capital market activity was reduced because of the lack of new debt \nand/or equity issuances on the stock exchange during the pandemic. Revisions to alternative \ninvestments board rules facilitated cottage and small industries to list equity helping to increase \ncapital market activity. Introducing comprehensive NPL management strategies will help to \ncombat  deteriorating  asset  quality  in  financial  institutions  in  the  post-COVID-19  era. \nImplementation of reforms in the insurance sector and fintech to support innovation will result in \nincreased connectivity, inclusion, and employment. \n \n22.  Reform area 1: Nonbank financial systems developed. The objectives were to develop \ncapital markets on both the demand and supply sides to increase access to finance by the private \nsector and improve governance of systems and issuers. Subprogram 1 developed a strategy for \nbond issuance, and policies on new housing financing and pensions. Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment issued two bonds with tenors to maturity of 3 years in September 2020 and 10 years \nin February 2021. A pension strategy to cover private sector employees and the self-employed, \nwith a gender focus, was approved. Under subprogram 3, government bonds have been listed \non the RSEB, adding liquidity to the debt markets, establishing yield curves, and providing an \nalternative investment option to long-term investors in the country.23 To attract more cottage and \n22F\nsmall industry entities to capital markets, revisions were made to rules and regulations on \nalternative investment market instruments.24 Subprogram 3 also concentrated on improved \n23F\ncorporate governance and corporate social responsibility rules. A housing market demand survey \nwas conducted in key urban areas based on which the RMA issued a directive on housing finance \nwhich incentivizes financial institutions to develop finance schemes focused on identified needs \nof the focusing finance sector.25 The RMA developed an insurance strategy to widen the scope \n24F\nof insurance products and investments made by insurers after regulations were imposed in 2019. \n \n23.  Reform area 2: Stability and integrity of the financial system strengthened. Under \nsubprogram 1, the RMA instituted risk-based bank supervision, including stress testing, and \ndesigned templates for institutional risk profiles and risk assessment that will significantly assist \nRMA  supervision.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  reforms  were  continued  in  the  areas  of  risk \nassessment, with emphasis on credit and cybersecurity risks, and the inclusion of International \nFinancial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 in prudential requirements.26 All financial institutions \n25F\noperationalized an online anti-money laundering reporting system. Subprogram 3 will focus on \n \n23 ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Capital Market Development. Manila; and \nGovernment of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2019.

These small business entities usually fund themselves through a venture capital funds (Jabchor) \nand not continue on to list their businesses. Jabchor is a joint initiative by the RMA, the Company Registry Division \nof the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the RSEB, the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce, and Thimphu Tech Park Limited \nto promote alternative sources of equity financing.  \n25 The survey revealed that a deficit exists in the supply side of housing units despite about 6,147 units added annually \nto the existing stock. In order that financial institutions are incentivized reduced risk weights have been assigned to \nall new housing loans going forward by the RMA.  \n26 The Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan signed an agreement with the IFRS Foundation to adopt \nthe IFRS in a phased manner (phase 1 during 2013\u20132015, phase 2 during 2016\u20132017, and phase 3 during 2018\u2013\n2019), aiming for full adoption and compliance by 2022. \n \n ", "8 \nimplementing IFRS 9, revised rules on anti-money laundering, and further alignment with Basel \nIII, leading to enhanced stability, efficiency, and inclusiveness in financial markets. This will also \nlead to increased compliance with risk-based supervision and compliance in both the banking \nand nonbanking sectors. RMA formulated a comprehensive NPL strategy where key aspects like \ncredit underwriting, asset valuation, and monitoring were analyzed in depth to recommend \nstrategies to be adopted by the RMA and all financial institutions. RMA will be implementing these \nstrategies with capacity building acquired from ADB\u2019s TA and commence monitoring NPLs on \nannual basis on new loans created after the COVID-pandemic hit the country.27  \n26F\n  \n24.  Reform area 3: Financial inclusion promoted. Under subprogram 1, the RMA approved \nthe  National  Financial  Inclusion  Strategy,  2018\u20132023  and  the  National  Financial  Literacy \nStrategy, 2018\u20132023.28 Under subprogram 2, the RMA approved an action plan for the National \n27F\nFinancial  Literacy  Strategy  and  the  National  Financial  Inclusion  Strategy  that  included  (i) \nidentifying the responsible agencies and clear timelines for developing a gender-responsive and \nsocially inclusive financial literacy program, (ii) conducting surveys on demand and use of \nfinancial products by women and other user groups, and (iii) ensuring disaggregating data and \nanalysis  by  sex.  RMA  established  a  consumer  redress  mechanism  to  provide  redress  to \naggrieved  consumers,  promote  fair  trade  practices,  and  empower  and  enhance  consumer \nconfidence in financial services. The RMA approved an inclusive green finance road map in 2020 \nto promote access to finance for entrepreneurs seeking funding for environment-friendly projects. \nSubprogram 3 will focus on developing a green taxonomy in line with the phased approach of the \nRMA\u2019s green finance road map. Fintech options through sandbox arrangements have been \nestablished to promote digital inclusion (footnote 17). \n \n25.  Changes to policy actions in the policy design and monitoring framework. After \nfurther consultations with the government, the indicative policy actions of subprogram 3 were \nrevised by the project team to add clarity and strengthen the objectives. A new area of revisions \nto rules and regulations on the Alternative Investment Market Board of the RSEB was added.29 \n28F\n \n26.  Post-program engagement framework. The framework was included to facilitate a \nstructured dialogue on finance sector reforms between ADB, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and \nthe  RMA.  The  post-program  engagement  framework  includes  (i)  development  of  further \nstrategies and implementation activities, (ii) awareness and capacity building activities, and (iii) \nstructured monitoring by supervisory agencies related to the three reform areas. The framework \nwas expanded to include the following actions: a government bond issuance program adding \nliquidity to capital markets, several companies adopting the new corporate governance and \ncorporate social responsibility rules, new listings on the Alternative Investment Market board of \nRSEB and formulating a strategy for RSEB\u2019s to develop green finance. Under the development \nof the nonbanking financial system pillar of the framework, proposed amendments of the Financial \nServices Act, 2011 will be enacted. Under the strengthening of the stability and integrity of the \nfinancial  system  pillar,  IFRS  implementation  and  commercial  banks  achieving  International \nOrganization  for  Standardization  certifications  on  data  security  standards  are  included.30 \n29F\nFinancial  inclusion  will  be  strengthened  through  public  awareness  activities  to  educate \n \n27 ADB. 2020.

ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has supported the government\u2019s reform agenda through a \nstrategic framework; informed policy dialogue; evidence-based studies; and sequencing and \npacing of reforms, particularly in planning and coordinating various elements of reforms. ADB has \nbeen a long-standing partner in Bhutan\u2019s development since 1982. The Bhutan\u2013ADB partnership \nin the finance sector began in 1984, with the provision of the Industrial Sector Study and technical \nassistance (TA) for the Establishment of a Development Financing Mechanism. 31 ADB helped to \n30F\nstrengthen the RMA\u2019s central banking role as the single regulator of banks and nonbanks under \nthe Financial Institution Act, 1992. ADB has maintained a high level of continuity through an \nadvisory role, particularly in its core sectors.32 The One ADB approach has been implemented \n31F\nmore effectively since 2017, when ADB\u2019s Bhutan Resident Mission expanded and undertook core \ntasks in country operations. A programmatic approach with two subprograms were selected and \napproved in 2019 to enable ADB to stay engaged and to help the government implement effective \nlong-term reforms. \n \n28.  Lessons.  The  program  has  drawn  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  policy-based \nprograms that supported finance sector reforms.33 The design of subprogram 3 is based on the \n32F\nachievements  and  lessons  of  subprograms  1  and  2.  Subprogram  1  interventions  laid  the \ngroundwork with (i) a strategy on long-term government bond issuance, and (ii) policies on \nnational  housing  with  a  focus  on  affordable  housing  and  pension  and  provident  funds. \nSubprogram 2 policy actions ensured that issuing government bonds and planned issuances with \nan acceptable frequency would be in place. Both analyzed the housing deficit and lack of \nadequate financial mechanisms in the affordable housing sector. Complying with comprehensive \ncredit underwriting standards would need to be pursued with capacity building, coupled with \nrobust information systems to mitigate NPLs in the system. Establishing a data warehousing \npolicy is seen as an important deliverable for the RMA, enabling timely and accurate prudential \nregulations and effective monitoring. The IED\u2019s validation report noted that efforts to diversify the \neconomy cannot be sustained without accompanying public sector management and finance \nreforms that strengthen governance (footnote 1). \n \n29.  Development partner coordination. The involvement of development partners in the \nfinance sector in Bhutan is well defined.34 Access to credit was identified in a diagnostic study on \n33F\nBhutan  that  ADB  prepared  with  the  Government  of  Australia  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency. The government adopted its Capital Market Master Plan in 2014 following \nADB TA, which created a blueprint for a debt market strategy.35 The International Monetary Fund \n34F\n(IMF) is helping the RMA set up a liquidity forecasting framework. The World Bank created the \nFinancial Sector Development Action Plan for Bhutan, which the government approved in 2017. \nOther World Bank engagements included (i) policy on strengthening and TA for capacity building \nin the insurance sector, and (ii) a multi-donor trust fund to help the Accounting and Auditing \nStandards Board in Bhutan on implementing IFRS by large companies in Bhutan (including the \nRMA). ADB collaborated closely with the IMF and the World Bank during program formulation. \n \n \n31 ADB. 2014.

The  program  will  support  the  government  with  institutional  reforms,  while \nimproving  the  technical  capacity  of  regulatory  and  financial  institutions.  The  performance \nindicators are included in the policy design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The impacts \nare as follows: (i) all bonds issued from 2018 to 2023 increase by 6.0%, reaching Nu9.3 billion; \n(ii) the year-on-year growth of private sector credit provided by commercial banks increases from \n14.7% in 2017 to 17.0% for 2019\u20132022; and (iii) the share of adults with access to credit reaches \n20.0% by 2022 (2018 baseline 16.0%). New outcome indicators were introduced with the \nsubprogram 3: the RMA is to include gross NPL ratio for new loans with effect from December \n2021 (on an annual basis), the financial inclusion indicator improves to 80% by 2022, and the \nshare of adults who have access to life insurance is at least 20% by 2022.36 \n35F\n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n  \n31.  The fiscal gap of the government in FY2021 was financed through external borrowings of \n$55.3 million and internal borrowings of $129.1 million.37 The fiscal gap of FY2022 is expected to \n36F\nbe met from external borrowings up to $60.6 million and internal borrowings up to $172.8 million. \nADB and the World Bank together are expected to provide all of the external financing. The \nbalance, 74% of the fiscal deficit in FY2022 or $172.8 million, will be financed through short-term \ngovernment bills and bonds (Table 2). The IMF assessed Bhutan as moderate risk in the 2018 \nIMF\u2013World Bank debt sustainability assessment. \n \nTable 2: Government Fiscal Position, as of 30 April 2021 \n($ million) \nIndicator  FY2021  FY2022 \nTotal revenues  775.55  772.43 \nTotal expenditure  959.99  1,005.84 \nFiscal deficit  (184.42)  (233.42) \nFiscal deficit (% to GDP)  (7.3)  (8.6) \nFinancing      \nFinancing need  184.42  233.42 \nExternal borrowinga  55.29  60.59 \nInternal borrowing  129.13  172.83 \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: The FY of the Government of Bhutan ends on 30 June. \u201cFY\u201d before a calendar year denotes the year in which \nthe FY ends, e.g., FY2022 ends on 30 June 2022. \na  Includes borrowings from multilateral development banks such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.  \nFY2021 ADB borrowings were $37.5 million while FY2022 ADB loan of $30 million are included. \nSource: Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Finance. 2021.

The government has requested a concessional loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \nloan under subprogram 3 will be disbursed in a single tranche. The loan has been advanced to \n \n36 NPL included as an indicator to check asset quality and financial inclusion to cover insurance under subprogram 3. \n37 External borrowings are met by ADB (53%), World Bank (42%), and International Fund for Agricultural Development \nand Japan International Cooperation Agency (5%) of the total requirement. \n ", "11 \nOctober 2021 given the increased pace of reforms required in financial markets because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n33.  The MOF is the executing agency, and the RMA and the Ministry of Works and Human \nSettlement are the implementing agencies. A steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the \nMOF and established under subprograms 1 and 2, will continue to guide and monitor the \nimplementation of subprogram 3. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) in a single \ntranche. The implementation period is October 2020\u2013September 2021 for subprogram 3. All \npolicy actions accomplished under subprograms 1 and 2 remain effective. Processing is expected \nto complete by October 2021 within the implementation period for subprogram 3 (December 2020 \nto March 2022) and all policy actions have been successfully completed. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE  \n  \n34.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nsafeguards.  It  is  not  expected  to  have  any  environmental,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous  peoples  safeguard  impacts  following  the  definition  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.38 The funds are for budget support and development of institutional capacity and \n37F\nreforms in financial markets. Counterpart support will be in the form of counterpart staff, office \nand housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. A matrix of potential environmental and social safeguards impacts has \nbeen prepared to assess each policy action. \n  \n35.  Poverty  and  social.  Bhutan\u2019s  limited  financial  market  development  has  had  a \ndisproportionate impact on the poor. Only 25% of adults in the poorest 40% of households in \nBhutan have a bank account, while the rate in other developing economies is 50% based on 2014 \ndata (footnote 6). Further, as of December 2020, although 76.08% of adults in Bhutan had a \nsavings account, only 21.79% had access to credit and 25.29% held an insurance policy.  \n  \n36.  Gender  elements.  The  program\u2019s  objectives  and  activities  align  with  the  goal  of \nadvancing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment by improving women\u2019s access to financial \nresources. The program includes two gender-related policy action areas: (i) the housing market \ndemand survey focused on addressing demand-side factors related to women in providing access \nto housing finance, and (ii) the RMA will adopt a data warehousing policy with sex-disaggregated \ndata templates that will enable gender focused financial information for decision making by the \nRMA and financial institutions. The program is categorized some gender elements. The housing \nmarket demand survey consisted of 40% female respondents in Thimphu and 37% in other urban \nareas (refer paras 14 and 15). \n \n37.  Governance.  Bhutan\u2019s  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  The  2016  public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment reported improvements from the previous \nassessment (2010).39 The lowest scores were given for accounting and reporting, government \n38F\ntransparency, and budget reliability. The government has implemented four of the five reform \nmeasures. These measures are the public expenditure management system and the integration \n \n38 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 World Bank. 2010.

Anticorruption.  Bhutan  consistently  scores  high  on  global  indexes  for  control  of \ncorruption, ranking 24th out of 180 economies in Transparency International\u2019s 2020 Corruption \nPerceptions Index. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1988, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n39.  Economic impact. The reforms are expected to improve overall financial market system \nand inclusiveness, and economic welfare (especially of women). The reforms will (i) improve \nfinancial literacy; (ii) enhance access to finance; and (iii) enable (a) people to take economic risks \nto pursue income-generation opportunities, (b) business development of the private sector, and \n(c) improved efficiencies of financial intermediation.  \n  \n40.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.41 Economic diversification mitigated by \n40F\ngovernment\u2019s reform measures like mobilizing domestic revenues through timely goods and \nservices tax implementation, prioritizing expenditure on development and welfare, and planning \nfor contingencies. Another risk is that high NPLs impact financial system stability; this has been \nmitigated by NPL resolution strategies and solvency requirements on all life insurance products \nwith effect from 2019. Both risks are rated medium. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n41.  The government and the Ministry of Finance have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe  program  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $30,000,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for subprogram  3  of  the  Financial  Market \nDevelopment Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nfor a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident  \n29 September 2021 \n \n40 The integration of the planning and monitoring system with a multiyear rolling budget system remains to be \nimplemented. \n41 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  13 \n \n \nPOLICY DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nMacroeconomic stability achieved, economic diversity and productive capacity enhanced, and poverty eradicated and inequality reduced (Twelfth \nFive Year Plan, 2018\u20132023)a \n \nOutcome  Risks and Critical Assumptions \nStability, efficiency, and inclusiveness of   External financial and economic shocks may limit the effectiveness of \nthe finance sector enhanced.  completed reforms. \n \nPrior Actions  Prior Actions  Prior Actions  Outcome Indicators  Post-Program \nSubprogram 1  Subprogram 2  Subprogram 3  Engagement Framework \nCompleted January 2018\u2013  Completed December  Completed October 2020 \u2013  October 2021- June 2023 \nNovember 2019  2019\u2013 September 2020  September 2021 \nReform Area 1: Nonbank financial system developed \n1.1  Ministry of Finance  2.1.
