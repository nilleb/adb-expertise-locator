With  populations  and  infrastructure  concentrated  in  coastal  areas,  economic \ndevelopment  throughout  the  region  remains  exceedingly  vulnerable  to  changing  precipitation \npatterns  and  increased  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events. 1\nThough  the  region  only \ncontributed  to  3.0%  of  energy-related  carbon  dioxide  emissions  in  2000,  aggressive  plans  for \neconomic  growth  place  its  energy  sector  as  the  fastest-growing  contributor  to  emissions \n(footnote 1). The trajectory in energy-related emissions in Southeast Asia presents an untapped \nopportunity for cost-effective mitigation that can advance sustainable and low-carbon growth. \n \n3. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  on  the  forefront  of  accelerating  private \nsector  investment  in  low-carbon  infrastructure  in  Southeast  Asia,  where  a  broad-based \nopportunity for energy efficiency improvement persists. Cofely has a proven business model2\n to \nimplement  and  operate  energy  efficiency  investments,  strong  execution  ability,  deep  technical \nexpertise, and broad support from its parent company, GDF Suez. In developing its 2012\u20132016 \nregional  business  plan,  Cofely  identified  a  robust  pipeline  of  energy  and  environmental \nefficiency  projects  across  Southeast  Asia.  ADB  supports  Cofely\u2019s  investment  plan  to  build, \nupgrade, and expand energy efficiency infrastructure in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Through \nfinancing and capacity development, ADB will demonstrate the limited risks and reliable returns \nassociated with a relatively untapped, yet rich category of low-carbon investment. \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  seeks  to remove  both the financial constraints  and  the  information  barriers \n4. \nthat inhibit the development of the energy efficiency market through a loan and parallel research \nand development TA (para. 30). Specifically, it will support the investment program of Cofely to \nexpand  and  upgrade  energy  efficiency  services  in  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  PDR, \nMalaysia,  the  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  loan  will  finance  long-term  energy \nefficiency  solutions  in  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  Southeast  Asia  that \nguarantee  energy  savings  for  hotels,  hospitals,  large  commercial  centers,  office  buildings, \nbusiness districts, and industrial facilities, and the expansion of energy efficiency services and \nsmall-scale renewable energy generation. ADB and Cofely will finance the investment program \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. The Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia \u2013 A Regional Review.

Cofely will be the borrower and will direct ADB funds to subprojects \nmanaged by its regional branches and subsidiaries. Moreover, ADB assistance will incorporate \nloan  conditionalities  such  as  the  maintenance  of  satisfactory  leverage  ratios,  a  transparent \ncorporate  governance  structure,  and  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  environmental  and \nsocial management system (ESMS) consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nGSES will guarantee all principal and interest due to ADB through a comprehensive guarantee, \navailable on first demand, designed to result in a full risk transfer of ADB\u2019s exposure to GSES. \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and/or Sponsor \n\n5. \nCofely  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  GSES,  the  world  leader  in  energy  and \nenvironmental efficiency services, and brings 60 years of GSES energy efficiency experience to \nSoutheast  Asia  through  offices  in  Singapore,  Thailand,  the  Philippines  and  Malaysia.  Cofely \ndesigns  and  implements  solutions  to  help  businesses  achieve  guaranteed  cost  savings  from \nenergy  efficiency \nimprovements.  Revenue  comes  from  Cofely  receiving  a  designated \npercentage of cost savings achieved in exchange for energy services rendered. Cofely partners \nwith  large  conglomerates  and  retailers,  multipremise  owners,  hospital  or  hotel  chains,  and \nproperty  developers  through  medium-term  (5\u20136  years)  and  long-term  (7\u201310  years)  contracts \noffering  comprehensive  solutions:  (i)  detailed  energy  audits  of  all  equipment;  (ii)  engineering \n(redesign,  resize,  retrofit,  and  replace);  (iii)  financing  through  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT) \ncontracts; (iv) project management; and (v) long-term operation and maintenance.  \n\n \n6. \nA key driver of Cofely\u2019s market leadership includes its ability to keep project costs to the \nminimum  because  of  its  independence from  equipment  providers.  It  maintains  a  brand-neutral \nequipment policy and exercises buying power by negotiating acquisition and spare parts prices \nfor equipment at the GDF Suez group level worldwide.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n4. \n\nThe Guarantor \n\n7. \nParent  company.

The parent company, GDF Suez, has \n9. \nbeen  active  for  many  years  in  all  its  business  areas  across  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region: \nelectricity  generation,  liquid  natural  gas,  and  energy  and  environmental  services.  It  has  an \nexisting installed capacity of 13 gigawatts and employs 11,000 people in the region. According \nto the 2011 Asia growth strategy, the group seeks to further accelerate its business in Asia over \nthe  next  5  years.4\n Subsequently,  GSES  plans  to  scale  up  regional  operations  significantly  by \nremoving  key  hurdles  that  inhibit  energy  efficiency  market  growth,  building  on  its  successful \nservices platform and vast experience as the world leader in energy efficiency. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n10. \nImpact.  The project will play a pioneering role in demonstrating the viability of  smaller-\nscale clean energy projects in the Asia and Pacific region. The demonstration effect is expected \nto encourage more investment in clean energy, specifically energy efficiency in ADB Southeast \nAsia  DMCs.  Additionally,  with  reduced  information  barriers,  proven  net  savings,  and  greater \naccess  to  financing,  the  demand  for  energy  efficiency  solutions  will  grow,  stimulating  greater \nprovision  of  energy  efficiency  services  in  the  region  and,  subsequently,  more  qualified  full-\nservice ESCOs. Energy savings are a promising and cost-effective mechanism to close the gap \nbetween energy demand and supply. ADB DMCs in Southeast Asia must enable private sector \nparticipation  to  develop  and  finance  a  substantial  amount  of  energy  efficiency  projects  to  help \nmeet  their  growing  energy  demand  and  climate  mitigation  targets.  The  demonstrational  effect \nwill  provide  a  model  for  other  ESCOs  to  replicate  and  BOT  investors  to  follow  in  terms  of \nfinancial structuring and environmental and social standards. \n \n11. \nOutcome.  The  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  is  the  demonstrated  viability  of  energy \nefficiency  investment  across  several  ADB  DMCs  through  realized  energy  savings,  emission \nreduction,  and  net  savings.  The  research  and  development  TA  will  further  promote  industry \ngrowth  by  raising  awareness  among  senior  managers  across  the  region  and  by  identifying \nspecific opportunities with the highest energy savings potential. \n \nOutputs.  The  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  implementation  and  operation  of  energy \n12. \nefficiency  projects  in  target  ADB  DMCs,  and  (ii) greater  awareness  and market  information  on \nenergy efficiency investment benefits. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020.  The  Project  is  closely  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy \n13. \n2020,5\n which aims to reduce poverty and improve living conditions and quality of life by scaling \nup  private  sector  development  and  supporting  environmentally  sustainable  models  through \nprojects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change challenges. \n \n\n                                                \n4  GDF Suez. 2011.

The  project  is \n14. \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy, 6  which  supports  wider  access  to  energy  through \ninvestments  in  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects.  In  2013,  ADB  will  raise  its \nclean  energy  investment  target  to  $2  billion  a  year  from  the  present  $1  billion  in  a  bid  to \naccelerate  low-carbon  growth  and  reduce  regional  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategies  for  various  ADB  DMCs  (including  two  target  DMCs,  Thailand  and  the \nPhilippines)  echo \nthe  energy  policy,  promoting  energy  security  and \nenvironmentally sustainable economic development.7\n \n \n15. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  As  discussed  in  the  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s  recent  review  of  ADB  energy  efficiency  interventions,  ADB  has  long  considered \nenergy  efficiency  improvement  to  be  a  highly  cost-effective  alternative  to  increasing  energy \navailability: 1 megawatt of power capacity saved costs about half that of adding equivalent coal-\nfired  power-generating  capacity. 8\n Review  of  past  ADB  loans  in  energy  efficiency  indicate  the \nneed to focus on removing market barriers (i.e. poor awareness among energy users, high risk \nperception  of  most  commercial  banks  and  relatively  poor  credibility  of  ESCOs).  Other \ndevelopment partners note that the efficacy of financial assistance can be heightened with TA \nfor project origination. Current project design integrates these key lessons and aims to arrive at \na more replicable and impactful model for the industry. \n\nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nOperational arrangements \n\n \nRelevant parties \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nArrangements \nEnergy efficiency projects are developed through build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \n(BOT) or service contracts between private entities. \nGDF Suez Energie Services is the leader in energy efficiency and \nenvironmental services and a wholly owned subsidiary of GDF Suez.

ADB will be the executing agency managing the \nfunds and implementation.9\n Through the $600,000 research and development TA, ADB plans to \nraise  awareness  of  energy  efficiency  throughout  the  region  among  commercial  managers  and \nindustry  associations,  and  facilitate  further  commercial  financing  in  the  sector  through \ndiscussions with financial institutions. Similar to the loan, the target ADB DMCs are Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Key tasks involve: \nestablishing  a  tangible  track  record  of  heating,  cooling  and  compressed-air  energy  efficiency \ninvestments through  benchmarking  analyses;  preparing  case  studies for hotels,  hospitals,  and \ndistrict  cooling;  and  analyzing  the  ESCO  competitive  landscape.  Planned  awareness-raising \nworkshops  aim  to  facilitate  dialogue  among  ESCOs,  banks  and  leaders  in  hospitality, \nhealthcare,  finance,  and  food  industries  in  cooperation  with  sustainable  energy  development \nauthorities of the target countries. The scope of work and communication strategy will be refined \nin consultation with the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), Southeast \nAsia Regional Department (SERD) and Department of External Relations (DER) to ensure that \nthe TA complements ADB-wide energy efficiency strategy.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n17. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  is  classified  as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The environment category was determined based on possible inclusion of \ncategory  B  projects  in  the  future,  although  the  current  portfolio  has  only  category  C  projects. \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been defined and effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be \nincorporated  in  the  borrower  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment  of  Cofely  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  deemed \nadequate.  Cofely  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy 10 and  report  regularly  to \nADB  on  the  compliance  (including  by  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws  and  adherence  to \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with \naffected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.11\n  \n\n                                                \n9  ADB  will  be  the  recruiting  entity  and  the  TA  will  be  funded  through  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund \n(TASF-IV).

ADB\u2019s review of the \nentity does not give ADB cause to believe that the entity has been established, or is being used \nfor  cross-border  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  or  terrorism  financing  in  the  jurisdictions \ninvolved in the project. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate \nprovisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and \nremedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n19. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n\nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \n20. \nCharter),12\n no  objection  of  the  governments  of  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Malaysia, \nthe  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam to the  proposed  assistance to  Cofely  will  be  obtained \nprior  to  the  disbursement  of  ADB  funds  for  use  by  Cofely  in  the  relevant  developing  member \ncountry. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory \nto ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by its Board of Directors. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n21. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan  of up to the \nlower of 50% (or, if the loan is covered by a risk participation agreement, up to 75%) of Cofely \nSoutheast  Asia  assets  and  $40,000,000  in  baht,  peso,  ringgit,  rupiah,  euro,  or  US  dollar  for \nenergy efficiency investments in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMalaysia,  the  Philippines, Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary capital  resources,  with \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, \nand as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n20 September 2012 \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 1966.
