An \nundertaken and is summarized in Appendix 14. \n \nThe Project aims to develop strategic international highways and \nimprove  road  sustainability  in  Uzbekistan.  It  will  have  two  major \nroad  sector \nroad  development,  and \ncomponents: \nsustainability.  \n \nThe  road  development  component  will  improve  131  kilometers \n(km) of the A-380 highway. International competitive bidding (ICB) \nfor civil works will be applied for the first time. Advisory support for \nproject  management,  construction  supervision,  and  procurement \nwill be provided to assist the executing agency (EA) in managing, \nimplementing,  and  supervising  the  overall  Project  to  meet  high \ninternational standards.  \n \nThe  road  sector  sustainability  component  will  primarily  assist  the \nGovernment  in  strengthening  operation  and  maintenance  of  the \nroad network in Uzbekistan including improvement of road sector \ninstitutions, road sector planning and budgeting; and provision of \nroad equipment. Institutional support for road sector planning and \nmanagement  and  advisory  support \nfor  development  of  a \ncommercially  operated  road  equipment  pool  company  will  be \nprovided. \n \nUnder  the  Government\u2019s  Road  Development  Program  2007\u2013\nroad \n2010,  about  $320  million  has  been  allocated \nreconstruction  and  $460  million  for  repairs,  focusing  on  the \ndevelopment  of  strategic  international  highways.  The  highways \nare  included  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) corridors recently agreed among its member countries. \nCAREC  corridors  development  aims  to  enhance  international \ntrade  and  regional  connectivity.

Further reform is expected together with the investments in \nthe  Government\u2019s  Road  Development  Program  2007\u20132010. \nSupport  for  the  road  sector  is  justified  based  on  reform  progress \nand fits with ADB\u2019s strategy of promoting regional cooperation.  \n \nAdequate  road  maintenance  is  essential  if  the  road  network  and \ninternational and national connectivity are to be sustained. In past \nto  road  network \nyears, \ndeterioration.  Addressing  road  sustainability  requires  a  clear \nstrategy  for  road  sector  management  on:  (i)  institution  and \nmanagement, \nand \n(iv) governance  and  accountability.  The  Government  has \nprogressed  well  in  ensuring  a  steady  flow  of  maintenance  funds \nby  establishing  a  Road  Fund.  However,  the  road  maintenance \nbudget for primary roads is currently not sufficient to fully sustain \nthe  roads.  Outsourcing  road  maintenance  through  competitive \nbidding  would,  to  some  extent,  help  reduce  maintenance  cost. \nThe Road Fund\u2019s capacity in road planning and management will \nbe  improved  to  meet  these  overall  key  principles.  In  addition, \nfinancing  support  of  road  equipment  will  pave  the  way  for \nstrengthening \nroad  construction \nenterprises.  It  is  a  first  step  toward  fully  private  provision  of \nequipment in a competitive environment.  \n \nis  sustainable  economic \nThe  main \ndevelopment  and  increased  domestic  and  international  trade \nthrough an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road network \nin Uzbekistan and improved regional connectivity. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $173.5  million  equivalent, \nincluding cost of taxes and duties of $22.2 million. \n \nA loan of $75.3 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility.

Two \nstaff  from  the  Road  Fund  will  be  appointed  to  assist  PIU  in \nimplementing  the  road  development  component  and  institutional \nsupport for the road sector planning and management system. A \nstaff  from  the  REPC  will  be  assigned  to  help  PIU  implement  the \nfor \nprocurement  of  road  equipment  and  advisory  support \ndevelopment of the REPC.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  civil  works,  and  related  services  financed \nfrom  the  ADB  loan  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nTo  ensure  competition,  ICB  contract  packages  will  be  adopted. \nCivil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  through  ICB  among  pre-\nqualified bidders. ICB will be used for civil works over $2 million; \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works of $100,000\u2013$2 \nmillion; shopping for civil works up to $100,000; and ICB for goods \nover $1 million.  \n \nThe  Project  involves  five  ICB  contract  packages  for  civil  works \nand two ICB packages for goods.  \n \nIt  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  about  360  person-months  of \ninternational  and \nconsultancy  services  (120  person-months \n240 person-month national) will be needed for: (i) an international \nprocurement  specialist,  (ii)  project  management  and  construction \nsupervision,  (iii)  advisory  support  for  development  of  the  REPC, \nand  (iv)  road  sector  planning  and  management  system.  Detailed \nengineering  design  is  being  undertaken  by  locally  recruited \nconsultants and financed from the Road Fund resources.  \n \nAn individual procurement specialist with international experience \nwill  be  recruited  to  help  implement  the  procurement  of  works, \ngoods, and services. For the remaining services, consulting firms \nwill be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\ntechnical  proposals \n\nselection procedures in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Full \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  required  for  the  project  management \nand  construction  supervision,  and  the  road  sector  planning  and \nfor \nmanagement  system;  and  biodata \ndevelopment of the REPC.  \n \nUnder the road development component, the main benefits will be \nvehicle  operating  cost  and  accident  cost  savings,  resulting  from \nreduced  road  pavement  roughness  and  better  vehicle  running \nconditions.  Potential  project  beneficiaries  will  be  road  users \ncurrently using the existing road, diverted road users from railway \nservices  parallel  to  the  A-380  highway,  diverted  road  users  from \ninternational traffic currently using the northern route from and to \nKazakhstan  and  Russian  Federation,  and  generated  traffic.  This \ncomponent  is  economically  viable,  given  economic  internal  rates \nof  return  (EIRRs)  of  17%  (road  section  1)  and  34%  (road \nsection 2). \n \nUnder  the  road  sector  sustainability  component,  the  enhanced \nroad  sector  maintenance  capacity  is  considered  over  a  10-year \nperiod.  The  with-project  scenario  assumes  a  well-planned  and \nmanaged road sector together with better equipped, commercially \noperated  road  enterprises  with  the  capacity  to  undertake  higher \nlevels  of  better  quality  road  maintenance.  This  is  compared  with \npoor management and planning and ill-equipped road enterprises \nin  the  without-project  case.  The  incremental  costs  and  benefits \nwere compared and the EIRR for the component was estimated at \n33%, which is economically viable. The investment and operation \nof the road equipment is financially feasible. The financial rate of \nreturn was estimated at 13% which is above the weighted average \ncost of capital of 4.6%. The REPC is expected to meet cash flow \nas  well  as  operating  requirements,  meet  full  debt  service \nobligations, and maintain a minimum 80:20 debt-equity ratio. \n \nAt \nthe  Road  Fund\u2019s \ncommitment to improve its planning capacity, provide counterpart \nresources  and  support  for  the  Project  in  a  timely  manner,  and \nimprove \nthe \ngovernment  level,  the  main  assumptions  of  the  Project  are \ncommitment  to  further  reform  the  road  sector,  adopt  good \ngovernance, apply cost recovery principles in investment, invest in \ncross-border  facilities  in  a  timely  manner,  and  sustain  policies \nconducive to economic growth and regional integration. \n \nThe  main  risks  to  the  Project  include  start-up  delays  in  project \nimplementation,  lack  of  strict  adherence  to  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nguidelines,  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project,  and  development  of \nthe REPC.  \n \nThe  following  measures  are  taken  to  mitigate  the  start-up delays \nrisk:  (i)  recruitment  of  an  international  procurement  specialist  to \n\nthe  entire  A-380  highway  as  scheduled.  At \n\nlevel,  assumptions \n\nthe  EA \n\ninclude \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n       v   \n\n \n\nhelp  the  EA  procure  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants; \n(ii) recruitment  of  a  professional  with  experience  in  externally \nfunded  projects  as  the  PIU  head;  and  (iii)  finalization  of  the \ndetailed  design  for  the  first  civil  works  package  using  the  Road \nFund budget.  \n \nThe  Road  Fund  is  to  announce  the  Project  and  business \nopportunities  associated  with  the  Project,  including  the  tender \nprocess,  on  its  web  page.  To  avoid  adverse  impacts  of  the \nProject,  contractors  will  be  required  to  adopt  strict  controls  over \nworkers\u2019 conduct, and adopt environmental protection and comply \nwith  mitigation  measures.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided \nunder  the  Project  to  help  the  REPC  run  the  services  and  further \ncommercialize the REPC. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit, for your approval, the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC) \nRegional Road Project (the Project). The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in \nAppendix 1.1 \n \n\nII.  \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA.  \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nUzbekistan is a historical land bridge between the east (East Asia) and west (Europe), \nas well as the north (Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and the Baltic states) and south (Indian \nOcean and Persian Gulf). Uzbekistan can benefit from this role only if the transport network is \nwell developed and maintained. With a population of 26.8 million, it is the most populous country \nin Central Asia with the second largest area. Although largely arid, irrigated areas along the two \nmain rivers make it an important agricultural producer, specializing in cotton, for which it is the \nsecond largest exporter in the world. It is rich in natural resources, including minerals and large \nreserves of natural gas.  \n \n3. \nUzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has been growing at about 7% per year in \n2004\u20132006  after  an  initial  post-independence  period  of  decline.  It  is  predicted  that  GDP  will \nincrease by about 6% annually up to 2020. This growth is expected to increase freight transport \nby about 4.4% and passenger transport by about 5.1% per annum.2  \n \nEfficient  transport  is  important  to  achieve  the  country\u2019s  development  objectives. \n4. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  primary  roads,  totaling  42,530  kilometers  (km),  are  divided  into  international \n(3,626 km), national (16,909 km), and regional (local) roads (21,995 km). In addition, there are \nabout  140,000  km  of  urban  and  rural  roads.  In  2005,  road  transport  carried  about  85%  of \nUzbekistan\u2019s  freight  in  terms  of  ton-km  and  93%  of  its  passengers  in  terms  of  passenger-km. \nRoad  traffic  volume  varies  across  road  sections.  Some  major  roads  carry  more  than \n10,000 vehicles per day. Traffic volume grew about 4% per year over 2000\u20132005. \n \nThe  primary  highways,  mostly  asphalt-paved,  are  the  backbone  of  the  road  network  in \n5. \nUzbekistan. The Republican Road Fund (the Road Fund) under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nhas  responsibility  for  financing  reconstruction,  repairs,  and  maintenance  of  the  primary \nhighways.  Its  budget  for  road  works  has  increased  from  about  $125  million  in  2005  to  about \n$184 million  in  2007  or  by  about  20%  annually.  Table  1  shows  that  about  39%  of  the  budget \nwas allocated for reconstruction, 42% for repair, and 19% for routine maintenance.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was provided to prepare the Project.

Some of these, such as road \nfunding  and  regulatory  framework,  have  now  been  partly  or  are  being  addressed  by  the \nGovernment. \n \nB.  \n  \n \n \n7. \nRoad  Sector  Reforms. There has been significant road sector reform in recent years. \nThe road sector has been transformed from a single state road agency, Uzavtoyul, responsible \nfor  policy,  planning,  funding,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  primary \nroads into a new structure that is much more closely in line with international best practice.   \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nChallenges \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nThe  Road  Board,  chaired  by  a  deputy  prime  minister,  is  responsible  for  policy \nformulation in the road sector.  \n\nThe  Uzbek  Association  of  Transport  and  Transport  Communications \ncoordinating the activities of the transport sector\u2019s main stakeholders. \n\nis \n\nThe  Road  Fund  under  MOF  is  responsible  for  managing  and  funding  primary \nroads, including planning and outsourcing of construction, reconstruction, repairs, \nand maintenance; and project implementation and supervision.  \n\nState  joint  stock  company  (SJSC)  Uzavtoyul  is  responsible  for  the  O&M  of \nprimary roads. In these tasks, it is assisted by two of its divisions. One division, \nled  by  seven  core  subsidiaries,  is  responsible  for  maintenance  of  international \nand  national  roads.  The  other  division,  led  by  13  core  subsidiaries  with  161 \nancillary  subsidiaries,  is  responsible  for  maintenance  of  district  roads.  In  the \nconduct of these O&M tasks, the core Uzavtuyol subsidiaries report to, and are \nfunded  by,  the  Road  Fund.  The  ancillary  subsidiaries,  however,  work  under \nperformance-based contracts.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n8. \nSteps  have  been  taken  to  stimulate  commercialization  of  Uzavtuyol  subsidiaries  by \nintroducing  competitive  bidding  for  road  construction,  reconstruction,  and  repairs;  and  the \nrequirement of performance-based contracts for maintenance. However, overall the subsidiaries \nremain closely linked to the Government and the Road Fund. In order to enhance efficiency and \ncompetition  in  the  road  sector,  the  Government  should  consider  further  reforms  to  stimulate \nprivate sector development in the road construction industry. Among the steps to achieve this, \nthe  Government  should  take  steps  towards  making  Uzavtuyol  subsidiaries  legally,  financially, \nand managerially independent and towards introducing competitive bidding for maintenance. A \nroad sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n9. \nThe  Road  Fund\u2019s  capacity  in  planning  and  execution  is  inadequate,  so  it  requires \ninstitutional capacity enhancement and human resources strengthening. Assistance is required \nin database development, maintenance program optimization, and investment strategy.  \n \n \n10. \nRoad Network and Border Crossing. In general, despite a few missing links, the road \nnetwork  has  good  coverage  and  sufficient  capacity  to  accommodate  the  moderately  growing \ntraffic  demand.  Most  major  corridors  are  dual  carriageways  and  the  current  volume  capacity \nratios  are  relatively  low.  However,  parts  of  the  network  are  in  poor  condition  and  require \nrehabilitation. The road quality is deteriorating because of inadequate maintenance. In addition, \npoor  signposting  and  road  markings  have  been  observed  in  some  roads,  raising  road  safety \nconcerns.  \n \n11. \ncorridors out of 20 corridors (Table 2).  \n \n\nThe  Government  is  focused  on  the  development  of  the  following  five  international \n\nTable 2:  Primary International Road Corridors \n\n \n\n1. \n\n2. \n3. \n\nEurope, Russian Federation, PRC, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyz Republic\u2013Chimkent \n(Kazakhstan)\u2013Gisht Kuprik/Yallama\u2013Tashkent\u2013Samarkand\u2013Bukhara\u2013Alat\u2013Farap \n(Turkmenistan)\u2013Iran and Turkey \nTashkent\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan\u2013Dustlik\u2013Osh (Kyrgyz Republic)\u2013Kashgar (PRC) \nSamarkand\u2013Karshi\u2013Termez\u2013Saryasiya\u2013Dushanbe (Tajikistan)\u2013Termez\u2013Ayritom\u2013 \nHayratan (Afghanistan)\u2013Iran and Pakistan \nSamarkand\u2013Jartepa\u2013Panjikent (Tajikistan) \nBukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Kungrad\u2013Beyneu (Kazakhstan)\u2013Astrakhan (Russian Federation)  \n\n4. \n5. \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.   \nSource: Road Fund (2007). \n\n \n\n \n12. \nDespite  significant  improvements  in  recent  years,  transit  trade  facilitation  remains \ncomplex and time-consuming, especially for vehicles without Transports Internationaux Routiers \n(TIR)  Carnets. 3  The  combination  of  transposing  documentation  at  each  border,  different \ndocumentary requirements, a high percentage of physical examinations of goods, and payment \nof transit and other fees all mean border delays. The Government recognizes these issues and \nis  pursuing an  investment  plan  for  its  trade  facilitation  and  customs  cooperation  program,  and \nfor border post development at key crossings.  \n \nTransit  Traffic.  The  substantial  decline  in  transit  traffic  since  1998  suggests  the \n13. \npotential  to  expand  transit  traffic.  The  decline  that  was  common  throughout  Central  Asia \nresulted  in  a  general  reduction  of  international  trade.  Several  factors  caused  the  decline  in \n\n                                                 \n3 The  TIR  (Transports  Internationaux  Routiers)  system  relies  on  a  document  known  as  the  \"TIR  Carnet\"  which  is \nprinted and distributed by the Geneva-based International Road Transport Union for issue to the carnet users by \nthe  national  guarantee  associations  which  are  authorized  for  this  purpose  by  the  contracting  parties\u2019 \nadministrations. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nit  currently  remains \n\ntransit  traffic:  poorly  maintained  infrastructure,  high  transit  fees,  security  concerns,  and \ncompeting international corridors.  \n \n14. \nThere  is  international  competition  for  transit  traffic.  The  Niznhy  Pianj\u2013Dushanbe\u2013\nSarytash\u2013Osh\u2013Bishkek\u2013Almaty  corridor  could  compete  in  future  with  the  Dushanbe\u2013Termez\u2013\nTashkent\u2013Almaty  corridor.  Improvement  of  the  Osh\u2013Bishkek  route  has  already  reduced  the \nneed for Kyrgyz traffic to transit Uzbekistan, even in winter. \n \n15. \nA key factor in the economics of a corridor is the level of transit fees. With over 80% of \ntransit traffic being carried in Turkish and Iranian trucks, substantial revenue is generated from \nforeign transporters. There has been a decline of around 60% in the number of transiting trucks. \nWhile this is partly due to economic changes, with Kazakhstan for example sourcing more traffic \nvia  the  Russian  Federation,  transporters  consider  high  transit  fees  to  have  been  a  factor  and \nthere is a need to reconsider and rationalize them. The transit fees issues will be addressed in \nnew international transport law and new transit law under preparation by the Government. \n \nRoad  Maintenance.  Although  the  budget  allocated  for  routine  maintenance  has \n16. \ninadequate.  The  current  yearly  routine \nincreased  13%  annually, \nmaintenance budget of less than $1,000/km is approximately only half of the road maintenance \ncost standard of $2,200/km.4 The Road Fund, however, has been committed to increasing the \nmaintenance budget under the Government\u2019s Road Development Program 2007\u20132010.   \n \n17. \nA weakness of the Road Fund financing is that about 80% of the sources of funds are \nnot  directly  related  to  the  use  of  the  network.  On  the  other  hand,  fuel  levy  (about  60\u201370%  of \nother  countries\u2019  road  user  charges) 5 is  not  included  in  the  Road  Fund\u2019s  sources  of  funds. \nRevisiting  the  operations  of  the  Road  Fund  and  examining  the  effectiveness  of  the  current \noperating, financing, and quality control procedures would be timely.  \n \n18. \nIn  addition,  a  systematic  approach  to  prioritizing  road  maintenance  interventions  and \ndevelopment  planning  would  help  the  Road  Fund  better  assess  the  real  need  for  road \nmaintenance and development. Regular road condition and traffic surveys are urgently required. \nComprehensive data is crucial to quantify the extent of the maintenance backlog and develop a \nprioritized remedial maintenance program.  \n \n19. \nRoad Construction Industry. Under current road management arrangements, the road \nconstruction market for primary roads that are open for bidding is limited to reconstruction and \nrepairs.  With  seven  state-owned  enterprises  under  Uzavtoyul  specializing  in  construction  and \nmaintenance of international and national roads, and 161 smaller regionally-based state-owned \nenterprises,  coupled  with  limited  market  opportunities,  private  contractors  have  been  limited. \nHowever, the number of private contractors awarded construction and repair works by the Road \nFund has increased in the last two years.   \n \n20. \nA  distinction  should  be  made  between  Uzavtoyul  and  the  13  provincially-based  core \nsubsidiaries, and the rest of the Uzavtoyul subsidiaries. Uzavtoyul and the 13 provincially-based \ncore  subsidiaries  have  government-like \nfunctions,  such  as  road  data  collection  and \nprogramming,  with  less  business  activities.  On  the  other  hand,  the  seven  international  and \nnational roads subsidiaries and the 161  provincially-based ancillary subsidiaries mainly operate \nas business entities.  \n\n                                                 \n4   M.  Benmamaar.  2005.  Transport  Notes  TRN-4.  Why  Road  Maintenance  is  Important  and  How  to  Get  it  Done. \n\nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n\n5   Burningham,  S.  and  Stankevich,  N.  2006.

Sub-Saharan  Africa  Transport  Policy \nProgram.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n   \nThese latter Uzavtoyul subsidiaries provide an excellent foundation for the development \n21. \nof  the  road construction  and  maintenance  private  sector through  continued  commercialization, \nleading  to  privatization.  There  is  a  need  to  further  promote  competition  among  Uzavtoyul \nsubsidiaries,  and  strengthen  their  capacity  with  access  to  necessary  construction  and \nmaintenance equipment, to be better equipped for future opportunities in international as well as \nnational  projects.  Following  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  privatize  state-owned  enterprises,  it  is \nenvisaged these Uzavtoyul subsidiaries will also be gradually spun off from Uzavtoyul as private \ncontractors. \n \n22. \nRoad  Safety.  The  number  of  road  accidents  is  reported  at  about  10,000  per  year, \nresulting  in about  2,000  fatalities.  At  about  15.4  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles,  this  rate  is  very \nhigh  by  developed  countries\u2019  standards  but  low  for  developing  countries.  Responsibilities  for \nroad safety, split between several agencies, are defined in the Law on Road Safety, 1999. The \nMinistry of Internal Affairs is the leading agency responsible, through the State Traffic Police, for \nthe  development  of  safety  standards,  rules,  and  regulations;  traffic  management,  surveillance, \nand  enforcement;  vehicle  inspection;  and  accident  data  collection  and  analysis.  The  Uzbek \nAgency  for  Road  and  River  Transport  is  responsible  for  vehicle  certification  and  developing \nrelevant  regulations.  Uzavtoyul  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  road  design  complies  with  the \nroad safety design standard.  \n \nOn  some  roads,  road  signs  are  inadequate  and  road  marking  is  poor.  Overtaking  and \n23. \nspeeding  are  common  because  of  the  relatively  low  traffic  volume.  Implementation  of  speed \nlimits could be improved.    \n \nDespite the fact that accident data is not publicly disclosed, the Government has made a \n24. \ncoordinated effort for improving road safety. A Road Safety Commission has been set up under \nthe Cabinet of Ministers. A road safety plan is being implemented, including a safety awareness \nprogram  and  education  for  students.  Finally,  accident  data  and  black  spots  are  analyzed  and \ncommunicated with Uzavtoyul.   \n \n\n2.  \n\nOpportunities \n\n \nRoad Development. Under the Government\u2019s Road Development Program 2007\u20132010, \n25. \nabout $300 million has been allocated for road reconstruction. It will focus on the development \nof the following international highways: M-34, M-39, A-378, A-380, M-37, Tashkent Ring Road, \nand  Gulistan\u2013Angren.  Improving  these  international  road  corridors,  road-related  facilities,  and \nother trade and transport facilitation measures (including streamlining of procedures at borders) \nwill facilitate passenger and cargo movement and is expected to increase domestic and regional \ntrade.  \n \nin  CAREC  corridors  2 \n26.  Most  of \n(Mediterranean\u2013East Asia), 3 (Russian Federation\u2013Middle East and South Asia), 5 (East Asia\u2013 \nMiddle  East  and  South  Asia),  and  6  (Europe\u2013Middle  East  and  South  Asia)  recently  agreed \namong its member countries (para. 41). CAREC corridors are important for international trade \nand regional connectivity. \n \n27. \nADB financing to support the Government\u2019s Road Development Program 2007\u20132010 will \ncontribute not only to achieving the Government\u2019s development objectives, but also enhancing \nregional connectivity and integration\u2014contributing to economic growth in the CAREC region. \n \n \n\ninternational  highways  are \n\nincluded \n\nthose \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n28. \nRoad  Sector  Sustainability.  Adequate  road  maintenance  is  essential  if  the  road \nnetwork and international and national connectivity is to be sustained. In past years, insufficient \nmaintenance has led to deterioration of the road network. Postponing road maintenance results \nin high direct and indirect costs. Addressing road sustainability requires a clear strategy for road \nsector management that attends to the following key principles: (i) improvement of road network \nplanning; (ii) clear ownership of roads and responsibilities of sector institutions; (iii) involvement \nof  road  stakeholders  in  the  planning  and  operations  of  roads;  (iv)  accurate  costing  of \ndevelopment and maintenance priorities; (v) development standards for improving roads; (vi) a \ncomprehensive  maintenance  program,  including  road  related  facilities;  and  (vii)  sufficient \ncapacity  in  funding,  managing,  and  supervising  road  maintenance.  Road  sustainability, \ntherefore,  needs  reforms  in  the  financing,  institutional  setup,  and  management  of  road \nmaintenance with the active participation of direct and indirect users.     \n \nThe  Government  has  a  clear  road  sector  reform  program  to  be  implemented  in  2007\u2013\n29. \n2010 (para. 38). A new road law, approved by parliament and the senate in 2007, will provide a \nlegal basis for introducing toll roads and private sector participations in road operations. It also \nclearly  distinguishes  road  ownership  and  responsibilities  of  road  sector  institutions,  including \ndistrict governments. These show the Government\u2019s serious commitment to improving the road \nsector.  However,  only  successful  implementation  of  the  new  law  will  guarantee  the  targeted \noutcomes. \n  \nThe Government has progressed well in ensuring a steady flow of maintenance funds by \n30. \nestablishing the Road Fund. However, the road maintenance budget for primary roads needs to \nbe increased to sustain the roads. Outsourcing road maintenance through competitive bidding \nwould  help  reduce  maintenance  cost  (footnote 4).  The  Road  Fund\u2019s  capacity  in  road  planning \nand  management  can  be  improved  to  meet  the  overall  key  principles  above  with  targeted \nadvisory support.  \n \n31. \nIn  addition,  making  road  equipment  available  can  pave  the  way  for  strengthening  the \nprivate sector and road construction enterprises. It is a first step toward fully private provision of \nequipment  in  a  competitive  environment.  Many  private  equipment  pool  companies  operate \nsuccessfully in industrialized and semi-industrialized countries.6 \n \nC. \n \n32. \nADB  is  the  lead  agency  in  the  transport  sector,  customs  cooperation,  and  trade \nfacilitation activities of CAREC, of which Uzbekistan is a member. ADB, the European Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development,  and  the  governments  of  Germany  and  Japan  have  been \nfocusing their assistance on the railway sector in Uzbekistan while the World Bank focused on \nthe urban transport sector.  \n \nA  number  of  studies  were  completed  or  are  being  undertaken  through  ADB  regional \n33. \ntechnical  assistance  (TA).7 In  the  road  sector,  ADB  had  financed  a  TA8 and  approved  a  loan9 \nthat  was  later  cancelled  by  the  Government  because  (i)  the  road  section  identified  under  the \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned \n\n                                                 \n6   J.

Reform  measures  include  (i)  sector  unbundling  by  separating  road \ntransport  operation  and  road  construction;  (ii)  institutional  reform  by  creating  the  Uzbek \nAssociation of Transport and Transport Communications, the Road Board, and the Road Fund, \nand by restructuring Uzavtoyul; and (iii) promotion of competitive bidding for road construction \nworks,  many  of  which  are  recommendations  of  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Policy  Support \nfor  the  Road  Sector  (footnote  8).  Support  for  the  road  sector  is  justified  based  on  reform \nprogress  in  this  sector  and  fit  with  ADB  strategy  to  promote  regional  cooperation.  Further \nreassurance  for  ADB  includes  (i)  the  objectives  outlined  under  the  Government\u2019s  transport \nsector policy (para. 36); (ii) the completed Uzbekistan Transport Sector Strategy (2006-2020)10 \nwhich  was  strongly  supported  by  the  Government;  and  (iii)  the  committed  road  sector  reform \n(para. 38) and solid investment pipeline developed under the Government\u2019s Road Development \nProgram 2007\u20132010. \n \nThe  2006  ADB  country  assistance  program  evaluation  for  Uzbekistan  evaluated  the \n35. \noverall  program  \u201csatisfactory\u201d  based  on  the  criteria  of  relevance  and  efficacy. 11 It  classifies \ntransport  sector  projects  \u201cgenerally  satisfactory\u201d  and  noted  good  progress  in  the  transport \nsector. However, several issues remain. The proposed Project, therefore, will address relevant \nissues identified in the country assistance program evaluation\u2014including project focus, financial \nsustainability, inefficient practices of government agencies, the lacking link between policies and \npractice, and project implementation. Financial sustainability is also key to the success of road \nprojects.12    \n \nD. \n \n36. \nGovernment  Strategy.  The  Government\u2019s  Concept  of  Development  of  Transport  and \nCommunications  in  Uzbekistan  to  2015  outlines  transport  sector  development  objectives  and \nstrategic  directions.  The  concept  underscores  the  importance  of  international  traffic,  and \nsuggests upgrading and maintaining the main highways to meet international standards. It also \nhighlights  the  need  for  improving  road  transit  and  trade  facilitation,  including  development  of \ncommon approaches to tariff and customs policy. The nonphysical obstacles to passenger and \nfreight  traffic  by  way  of  roads  should  be  removed.  Technical  equipment  at  border  crossings \nshould  be  improved  to  facilitate  efficient  border-crossing  procedures.  The  aim  is  to  enhance \ntrade between Uzbekistan and its trading partners. \n \n37. \nThe  Government  strongly  supported  the  transport  sector  strategy  prepared  under  the \nTransport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132010) (footnote 10). The strategy provides strategic direction \nand  an  investment  plan  for  the  transport  sector,  including  roads.  It  elaborates  the  policy \nthe \ntransport  development  concept  and \ndirection  outlined \nGovernment\u2019s  comprehensive  investment  program  for  improving  the  road  network.  The \ninvestment plan comprises (i) improvement or rehabilitation of the existing major roads; (ii) new \nconstruction  and  major  upgrading  of  the  existing  major  roads;  and  (iii)  implementation  of  road \nsafety measures, especially on domestic sections of international routes.  \n \n38. \nFurther reform in the road sector was recently announced and includes: (i) organization \nof  construction  and  reconstruction  of  primary  highways,  (ii)  development  of  modern  road \n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2005.

The  Project  is  fully  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  and  regional  strategies. \nADB\u2019s future role in the transport sector, as outlined in Uzbekistan\u2019s ADB country strategy and \nprogram 2006\u2013201014 will focus on (i) developing a reliable existing infrastructure network that \nopens  up  regional  and  international  markets;  (ii)  integrating  transport  systems  for  improved \nsafety and service quality; (iii) harmonizing the regulatory framework to promote efficiency; (iv) \nrestructuring  and  modernizing  the  transport  sector  by  promoting  competition;  (v)  competitive \nmarketing  and  tariff  setting;  and  (vi)  improving  financing  and  management  efficiency  and \neffectiveness.  \n \nThe  strategic  direction  envisaged  under  the  Uzbekistan  Transport  Sector  Strategy \n40. \n(2006-2020)  (footnote  2)  focuses  on  developing  international  corridors  that  will  serve  all  users \nand  attract  transit  traffic.  The  priority  so  far  has  been  on  the  development  of  the  east\u2013west \ncorridor.  The  opening  up  of  Afghanistan  offers  opportunities  in  the  medium-to-longer  term  for \ndevelopment  of  transit  corridors  between  Central  Asia  and  the  warm-water  ports  in  Iran  and \nPakistan. \n \n41. \nThe CAREC Transport Sector Strategy for 2008\u20132018 prepared under ADB assistance \nand endorsed during the Ministerial Meeting on 3 November 2007 has three overarching goals: \n(i) establishing competitive transport corridors across the CAREC region; (ii) facilitating efficient \nmovement  of  people  and  goods  across  borders;  and  (iii) developing  safe,  people-friendly \ntransport  systems  that  are  environmentally  friendly.  The  strategy  also  identified  six  strategic \ncorridors for full completion by 2018.15   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA.  \n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  support  an  adequate,  efficient,  safe,  and  sustainable  road  network  in \nUzbekistan that provides domestic and regional connectivity which will contribute to sustainable \neconomic development and increased domestic and international trade.  \n \nB.  \n\nOutputs \n \nThe  output  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  131  km  of  reconstructed  highway  sections  of  the      \n\n43. \nA-380:  Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Dautata \nstrengthened road sector institutions and road network management capacity.  \n \n44. \n(ii) a road sector sustainability component.  \n\nThe  Project  will  have  two  major  components:  (i)  a  road  development  component,  and  \n\n(Uzbekistan  and  Kazakhstan  border);  and \n\n(ii) \n\n \n45. \nRoad Development Component.

Reconstruction  of  the  Beyneu\u2013Aktau  (Caspian  Sea) \nand Beyneu\u2013Russian Federation border sections is also in the program for completion by 2011. \nThe A-380 highway is part of CAREC 6 that is considered high priority for completion by 2012 \n(footnote 15). \n \n46. \nthe  A-380  highway  Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Dautata \n(Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan Border) has deteriorated because of deferred maintenance and an \nincrease  in traffic.  With the  existing  traffic  of  about  5,500  passenger  car  equivalent  per  day  in \nthe  Khorezm  section,  the  A-380  highway  traffic  is  expected  to  reach  13,000  passenger  car \nequivalent per day in 2020. Reconstruction of this international road is technically justified. Out \nof  1,204  km  of  the  A-380  highway,  211  km  will  be  reconstructed  and  700  km  will  be  repaired \nduring  2007\u20132010;  the  remaining  road  sections  need  adequate  routine  maintenance.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment  in  reconstruction  of  the  A-380  highway  will  help  the  Government  accelerate \ncompletion of the overall program and introduce international best practice. \n \n47. \nCivil  works  under  this  component  will  comprise  reconstruction  of  131  km  of  the \nA380 highway  in  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  Province  to  meet  two-lane \ninternational  design  standard  with  a  four-lane  roadbed  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  The \nProject  will  not  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  nor  create  significant  environmental \nimpacts. The sections of the project road are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSection  1:  km876\u2013916  (40  km)  in  Kungrad  District  of  the  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan. \nSection  2:  km490\u2013581  (91  km)  in  Khazarsp  District  of  Khorezm  Province  and \nTortkul District of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. \n\nits  procurement  capability.  Advisory  support \n\n \nThe Government will, for the first time, adopt international competitive bidding (ICB) for \n48. \nroadworks. Advisory support for procurement of contractors and recruitment of consultants will \nbe  provided.  An  international  procurement  consultant  will  assist  the  executing  agency  (EA)  to \nstrengthen \nfor  project  management  and \nconstruction supervision will also be provided to assist the EA in managing, implementing, and \nsupervising the overall Project to meet high international standards. \n \n49. \nRoad  Sector  Sustainability  Component.  This  component  will  primarily  assist  the \nGovernment to strengthen road sector sustainability in Uzbekistan through improvement of road \nsector  institutions,  the  introduction  of  competition  in  road  maintenance  leading  to  further \ncommercialization  of  enterprises  and  eventually  privatization,  road  sector  planning,  and \nbudgeting  system;  and  provision  of  road  equipment  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  road \nmaintenance  program.  This  component  will  partly  support  the  road  sector  reforms  (para.  38) \nand will involve the following activities: \n \n\n(i) \n\nInstitutional  support  for  road  sector  planning  and  management  system. \nThis  subcomponent  will  provide  advisory  support  to  improve  the  Government\u2019s \ncurrent road sector planning and road sector financing systems and will focus on \nthe  promotion  of  road  user  charges  and  tolling  systems,  the  introduction  of  a \ncomputerized  road  network  data  base  system  and  road  sector  planning  and \nmanagement  systems,  and  the  preparation  of  a  time-bound  program  to  roll  out \nthese systems for countrywide application. This subcomponent will also provide \nadvisory support to rationalize road sector institutions and road enterprises, and \npromote competition in roadworks. It will train dedicated EA staff to build capacity \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\nin  road  sector  planning  and  management.  At  the  end  of  the  Project,  a  planning \nunit will have been fully established at the Road Fund. \n\nProvision  of  road  equipment.  The  Government  will  establish  the  road \nequipment  pool  company  (REPC)  and  this  subcomponent  will  assist  the \nGovernment with the development of the REPC and finance the procurement of \nroad equipment for the REPC.16 The immediate objective of the REPC will be to \nprovide services using its road equipment to road construction and maintenance \nenterprises  on  a \nthis \nsubcomponent  will  include  development  of  business  and  marketing  plans;  an \nequipment  service  charge  system;  and  proper  administrative,  accounting,  and \nfinancial  procedures.  The  subcomponent  will  also  study  the  feasibility  of \nprivatizing the REPC in the longer term. \n\nfull  cost  recovery  basis.  Advisory  support  under \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nC.  \n \n50. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $173.5  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \nand  duties  of  $22.2  million.  A  summary  of  the  project  investment  plan  is  in  Table  3.  Detailed \ncost estimates by financiers for the Project are in Appendix 3. \n \n\nTable 3: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\nItem \nA. Base Cost \n\n1. Road development component \n2.

The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  project  costs  of \n$98.2 million to finance taxes and duties, and part of the civil works and contingencies. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16  This  is  in  line  with  the  Transport  Sector  Strategy,  which  recommended  the  establishment  of  an  Equipment \nManagement  and  Utilization  Organization  providing  construction  equipment  to  road  companies  as  a  means  of \nenhancing their operational capacity and hence ability to compete on a broader market front. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nTable 4: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment \n       Total  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n75.3 \n98.2 \n173.5 \n\n      % \n43 \n57 \n100 \n\n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $75.3  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help \n52. \nfinance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  24  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.35% of the loan per \nannum. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n53. \nThe  Government  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  of  $55.31  million  for  the \nprovision of equipment to the REPC and the advisory support for the development of REPC with \nan additional spread of maximum 0.2% and on terms and conditions that are otherwise identical \nto the ADB loan to the Government. The REPC will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n54. \nThe Road Fund that is under and accountable to MOF will be the EA for the Project. It is \nadequately staffed and its financial management was found to be acceptable. Within the Road \nFund,  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  and  established.  The  PIU  will  have \noverall  responsibility  for  project  implementation.  A  PIU  head  will  be  a  professional  qualified  in \nproject  management,  with  experience  in  project  management  and  civil  works  acceptable  to \nADB.  The  Road  Fund  will  ensure  that,  during  the  entire  period  of  project  implementation,  the \nPIU  is  adequately  staffed  with  sufficient  experience  in  engineering,  financial,  procurement, \nadministrative, and secretarial staff; and equipped with the necessary office space, equipment, \nand facilities.  \n \nThe  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  overall  Project.  The  head  of  the \n55. \nRoad Fund\u2019s Technical Construction Division will be appointed to assist the PIU in implementing \nthe  road  development  component.  The  head  of  the  Road  Fund\u2019s  Program  and  Road \nConstruction  Development  Division  will  be  assigned  to  assist  the  PIU  in  implementing  the \ninstitutional  support  for  the  road  sector  planning  and  management  system.  A  staff  from  the \nREPC will be assigned to help PIU implement the procurement of road equipment and advisory \nsupport for development of the REPC. The proposed organizational structure is in Appendix 4.  \n \nThe  PIU  will  oversee  all  activities  under  the  Project,  including  project  preparation  and \n56. \nimplementation,  as  well  as  monitoring  and  reporting.  The  Road  Fund  will  introduce  a  suitable \nmanagement  information  system  in  the  PIU  to  manage  the  Project,  including  REPC-related \nactivities. The proposed arrangements and fund flow for the road development component and \nprocurement and operation of road equipment are in Appendix 5.  \n \n57. \nThe  PIU  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  will  submit  them  to  the  EA  and  ADB  every \nquarter.  It  will  also  submit  other  required  performance  and  monitoring  reports  twice  a  year. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nOverall  progress  and  compliance  with  conditions  of  the  Loan  Agreement  will  be  monitored \nregularly  with  periodic  reports  to  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation \nrequirements.  Reports  will  include  evaluation  of  issues  or  problems  and  will  recommend \nremedial actions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n58. \nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years, inclusive of procurement and construction \nactivities, and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2011. The implementation schedule \nis in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n4.  \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  involves  five  ICB  contract  packages  for  road  civil  works  and  two  ICB \n\nProcurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \n59. \nbe  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). To ensure competition, ICB contract packages will be adopted. Civil works contracts will \nbe procured through ICB among pre-qualified bidders. ICB will be used for civil works over $2 \nmillion; national competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works of $100,000\u2013$2 million; shopping for \ncivil  works  up  to  $100,000;  and  ICB  for  goods  over  $1 million.  The  Government  agreed  to \ninclude  the relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  in  all \nbidding and contractual documents.  \n \n60. \nThere is no NCB procurement envisaged under this project. However, should there be a \nneed  for  NCB  procurement  during  project  implementation,  before  commencement  of  NCB \nprocurement, ADB and the Government will review the Government\u2019s procurement procedures \nto ensure consistency with ADB requirements. Any  necessary modifications or clarifications to \nthe Government\u2019s procedures will be reflected in the procurement plan. \n \n61. \npackages for goods. The procurement plan for contractors and consultants is in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \nIt  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  about  360  person-months  of  consultancy  services  will  be \n62. \nneeded  (120  person-months  international  and  240  person-months  national).  About  57  person-\nmonths of international consultants and about 175 person-months of national consultants will be \nrequired for design review, and supervising construction of five civil works packages. A further \n5 person-months of international and 14 person-months of national consultants will be required \nfor  providing  support  for  development  of  the  REPC.  About  46  person-months  of  international \nand  51 person-months  of  national  consultants  will  be  required  to  assist  the  Road  Fund  in \ndeveloping  a  road  sector  planning  and  management  system,  and  conducting  studies  on  road \nfinancing and institutions.   \n \n63. \nDetailed  engineering  design  is  being  undertaken  by  locally  recruited  consultants  and \nfinanced from the Road Fund resources. The Road Fund will also engage 12 person-months of \nan  international  procurement  specialist  with  experience  in  externally  funded  projects  to  help \nimplement  the  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services.  An  individual  consultant  will  be \nselected and engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time) and the procurement plan agreed with ADB. \n \n64. \nConsulting  firms  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  procedures  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  the \nprocurement  plan  agreed  with  ADB.  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  required  for  project \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nmanagement  and  construction  supervision  and  the  road  sector  planning  and  management \nsystem; and bio-data technical proposals for the development of the REPC. The outline of terms \nof reference for consultants to be recruited under the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n65. \nThe Government has proposed the provision of an international procurement specialist, \nconsulting  services  for  the  development  of  REPC,  and  recurrent  costs  to  be  financed \nretroactively.  It  has  been  advised  that  the  recruitment  of  consulting  services  will  be  subject  to \ndue diligence by ADB.  \n \n66. \nADB Management has (i) approved advance action for procuring civil works and goods, \nand  (ii)  agreed  to  request  Board  approval  for  retroactive  financing  of  up  to  20%  of  the  loan \namount  provided  that  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  agreed  procedures  and  were \nincurred during the 12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Road Fund has \nbeen informed that approval of advanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n67. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nthe  Road  Fund.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Projects.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  PIU,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n68. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment procedures will generally be \nused  for  large  civil  works  contracts  and  consulting  services.  The  Road  Fund  will  establish  an \nimprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with an initial advance equivalent to \nestimated eligible project expenditures for the next 6 months which are to be paid through the \nimprest  account  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \nand detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The statement of expenditure \n(SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditure  and  to  liquidate  and  replenish \nthe imprest account for individual payments of $100,000 and below. \n\n \n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe  Road  Fund  shall  (i)  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  the  REPC;  (ii) \n69. \nhave  such  accounts  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards \nconsistently  applied  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of \nreference are acceptable to ADB; (iii) furnish to ADB as soon as available but in any event not \nlater  than  6 months  after  the  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  such  audited \nproject accounts and audited financial statements and the report of the auditors relating thereto \n(including the auditors\u2019 separate opinions on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with \nthe financial covenants of this Loan Agreement as well as on the use of the procedures for the \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nimprest  account  and  SOEs,  all  in  the  English  language;  and  (iv)  furnish  to  ADB  such  other \ninformation  concerning  such  accounts  and  financial  statements  and  the  audit  thereof  as  ADB \nshall  from  time  to  time  reasonably  request.  The  independent  auditors  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  will  be  financed  under  the \nloan.  Audited  financial  statements  should  be  prepared  in  conformity  with  sound  accounting \nstandards acceptable to ADB. \n \n \n \nThe  Road  Fund,  assisted  by  the  consultants  for  project  management  and  construction \n70. \nsupervision, will establish a project performance monitoring system within 6 months from project \ncommencement  and  collect  baseline  data  for  performance  monitoring.  The  key  indicators  and \nassumptions outlined at the impact and outcome levels in the Project\u2019s design and monitoring \nframework will be the primary data required for analysis. \n \n\nProject Performance and Monitoring Report \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\nProject Review  \n\nADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval. The ADB mission \n71. \nwill  review  project  implementation,  including  procurement,  civil  works,  and  environmental  and \nsocial safeguards based on quarterly progress reports. It will meet with the Government and the \nRoad Fund semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review will be carried \nout 2 years after the loan becomes effective. This will focus on the engineering, environmental, \nand  social  safeguards  of  the  Project;  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  review  of  the \nfinancial status of the PIU. Representatives of ADB, the Road Fund, and the REPC will take part \nin the review. The midterm review will evaluate compliance with warranties and representations \nof  the  Loan  Agreement  and  assurances.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse \ncorrections  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and  the  achievement  of  objectives.  A  project \ncompletion report will be submitted within 3 months of completion of the Project. \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Benefits  \n\n1.  \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n72. \nEconomic  sector  analysis  was  carried  out  separately  for  the  road  development \ncomponent and the road sector sustainability component. The methodology, key assumptions, \nand  results  are  summarized  in  Appendix  9.  The  main  benefits  of  the  road  development \ncomponent will be vehicle operating cost (VOC) and road accident cost savings resulting from \nthe  reduced  road  roughness  and  better  vehicle  running  conditions.  The  potential  project \nbeneficiaries  will  be  road  users  currently  using  the  existing road,  diverted  road  users  from  the \nrailway services parallel to the road, diverted road users from international traffic currently using \nthe northern route from and to Kazakhstan and Russian Federation. The economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  17%  for  road  section  1  and  34%  for  road  section  2.  This \ncomponent is economically viable.  \n \n73. \nUnder the road sector sustainability component, the enhanced road sector maintenance \ncapacity is considered over a 10-year period. The with-project scenario assumes a well-planned \nand  managed  road  sector  together  with  better  equipped,  commercially  operated  road \nenterprises with the capacity to undertake higher levels of better quality road maintenance. This \nis  compared  with  poor  management  and  planning  and  ill-equipped  road  enterprises  in  the \nwithout-project  case.  The  net  (incremental)  benefit  would  be  the  VOC  savings,  time  value \nsavings,  and  accident  savings  between  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  Under  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n2.  \n\nFinancial Sustainability  \n\nwithout-project  case,  average  road  roughness  will  be  higher  than  that  of  the  with-project  case \nbecause  of  lower  levels  of  quality  of  road  network  maintenance.  The  higher  average  road \nroughness  will  result  in  higher  VOC,  average  travel  time,  and  accident  rates.  The  incremental \ncosts  and  benefits  were  compared  and  the  EIRR  for  the  component  was  estimated  at  33%, \nwhich is economically viable. \n \n \n \n74. \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  REPC,  including  projected  operating  and \nfinancial  ratios  in  nominal  terms.  O&M  and  replacement  costs  were  considered.  Average \nequipment  hire  charge  was  estimated  on  a  full  cost  recovery  basis  with  a  rate  of  return  on \nassets  of  at  least  15%.  On  this  basis,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  13% \nwhich  is  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  4.6%.  Sensitivity  analyses  were \nundertaken  and  found  acceptable  switching  values  for  increases  in  capital  and  O&M  costs, \nimplementation delay, and decrease in revenue. The REPC is expected to meet cash flow and \noperating requirements, meet full debt service obligations, and maintain a minimum 80:20 debt-\nequity ratio. The REPC should be financially sustainable and should be able to repay the loan to \nthe  Government.  Summary  financial  analysis  for  the  investment  and  operation  of  the  road \nequipment is in Appendix 10 and financial projections for the REPC are in Appendix 11. \n \n \n \n75. \nUsing  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires  and  field  interviews,  financial \nmanagement  assessments  were  undertaken  for  the  Road  Fund  to  evaluate  their  ability  to \nundertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The Road Fund\u2019s \nfinancial  management  was  found  to  be  acceptable.  The  road  sector  sustainability  component \nrequires  establishment  and  development  of  a  road  equipment  company.  To  minimize  risks \nassociated  with  the  new  entity,  detailed  business  and  financial  management  plans  will  be \ndeveloped. The proposed Project includes consultant services to facilitate the development and \ncommercial  operations  of  the  REPC.  Summary  financial  management  analysis  is  in  Appendix \n12 and full financial management analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n3.  \n\n \n4.  \n \n\nSocial Dimensions and Poverty Reduction  \n\n76.           The  fieldwork  and  social  analysis  for  the  Project  were  part  of  project  preparatory  TA \n(footnote  1).  Consultation  was  conducted  in  July  2007  with  stakeholders,  including  local \npopulation  and  pastoral  nomads;  the  Road  Fund,  the  Project\u2019s  EA;  and  district  government \nofficials.  \n \n77. \nThe  Project  covers  two  road  sections  located  in  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  and \nKhorezm  Province.  Both  regions  are  among  provinces  in  Uzbekistan  with  the  highest  poverty \nincidence.  The  main  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  road  users  and  the  secondary \nbeneficiaries will be people living along the improved road. The Project will reconstruct existing \nroads within the current right-of-way owned by the Government. It will generate nonquantifiable \neconomic  and  social  benefits.  Better  roads  will  likely  attract  additional  economic  activity  and \ntraffic,  thus  generating  benefits  to  a  wider  circle  of  beneficiaries.  Direct  benefit  of  the  Project \nincludes  employment  opportunities  in  civil  works.  Construction  will  create  temporary  jobs,  and \nroutine maintenance will employ unskilled and semiskilled workers. Women will be encouraged \nto work and will be treated equitably.17 The Project will provide better and improved conditions \n\n                                                 \n17 The absence of comprehensive gender analysis in the infrastructure sector of Uzbekistan in general, and the lack \nof  actual  and  adequate  information  about  traveling  conditions  for  women,  complicates  the  process  of  developing \nthe gender-related activities. To maximize the project impact on women and men in the transport sector, a gender \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nfor all road users; and better access to health facilities, schools, and markets. Indirect benefits \nwill  include  employment  and  business  opportunities  such  as  restaurants,  vehicle  related \nservices,  and  small  businesses.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 13.  \n \nB.         Project Impacts  \n \n\n1.         Social Impacts and Involuntary Resettlement   \n\n \n78.      The Project will entail reconstruction of the existing road within the current right-of-way \nowned by the Government, and is free from settlements. Pavement and shoulder widening will \nremain  within  the  existing  right-of-way  in  all  cases.  There  are  neither  resettlement  issues  nor \nland  loss  in  the  project  area.  There  will  be  no  land,  housing,  property  or  income  loss;  and  no \nnew limitations to the movement of villagers and pastoralists. No archeological site, cemetery, \nor  other  sociocultural  facilities  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  No  systemic  socioeconomic  or \nsociocultural  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  that  would  trigger  the  preparation  of  indigenous \npeoples\u2019 development plans is foreseen. \n \n79.        Village  inhabitants  and  pastoral  nomads  are  vulnerable,  but  their  vulnerable  situations \nare neither directly nor indirectly related with the project road. They are completely dependent \non the shirkats (agricultural cooperatives) and the state for their livelihood. Improved transport \nconditions  may  facilitate  their  excessive  emigration.  Improved  roads  may  also  cause  road \naccidents  involving  road  users  and  local  inhabitants,  resulting  from  vehicle  speeding.  Project \nroads design has taken into account measures to avoid road accidents.  \n\n \n2.  \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n80. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines. The initial environmental examination (IEE) prepared for \nthe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines.   \n \n81. \nThe  IEE  identifies  that  project  impacts  are  not  significant,  and  most  of  them  are \nconstruction-related,  such  as  elevated  dust  and  noise  levels,  loss  of  roadside  vegetation,  and \ntraffic flow disruption. These impacts are considered temporary and will be addressed through \ncareful implementation of the environmental mitigation and monitoring plan. The Project is not \nanticipated  to  affect  ecologically  sensitive  areas  and  sites  of  archaeological,  cultural,  or \nhistorical significance.    \n \n82. \nThe contractors shall implement mitigation measures during the construction period. The \nEA, through the PIU, shall be assisted by the construction supervision consultant to (i) ensure \nthat  tender  and  contract  documents  clearly  set  out  the  contractor\u2019s  obligations  to  undertake \nIEE,  (ii)  supervise  and  monitor \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures \nthe \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  and \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan \nthe \nenvironmental  management  capacity  of  the  Road  Fund,  a  training  program  on  environmental \nassessment  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  implementation  shall  be  undertaken. \nThe summary IEE is in Appendix 14 and the IEE is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n \n\nimplement \nincluding  reporting  requirements.  To  help  develop \n\nidentified \n\nthe \n\n(iii) \n\nin \n\n__________________________ \n\nassessment  in  transport/highway  sector  of  Uzbekistan  project  was  formulated.

Since \n1. \nMarch 2006,  common  use  roads  or  primary  roads  have  been  administered  and  funded  by  the \nRepublican Road Fund (the Road Fund), under the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and maintained \nby Uzavtoyul\u2019s state-owned enterprises. Responsibility for other roads is split between regional \nand  city  authorities,  and  state  and  other  enterprises.  Much  of  the  network  was  constructed  to \ngenerous design standards. Most major corridors are dual carriageway. Volume capacity ratios \nare  relatively  low,  with  a  high  proportion  of  light  vehicles.

International  traffic  on  corridor \nRC3  has  declined  because  of  security  and  other  issues  with  Tajikistan  and  because  of \nrestrictions on traffic to and from Afghanistan (these were removed late 2005). Some sections of \nthe Karshi\u2013Surkhaendarya Valley route are difficult for heavy vehicles. The Bukhara-Karshi link \nis  important  for  traffic  through  Farap  (Turkmenistan)  to  Dushanbe.  Corridor  RC4  carries  little \ntransit  and  international  traffic  because  of  the  limited  hinterland  on  the  Tajik  side.  It  is \npredominantly used for local trade and for activities relating to mining operations higher up the \nvalley in Tajikistan. \n \nC.  \n \n \n \n4. \nSome  sections  of  the  international  corridors  are  in  poor  condition.  Improving  the \ninternational corridors is a Road Fund priority. Work in progress/planned will bring most sections \nup to standard by 2011. International corridors are generally also poor in neighboring countries. \nCorridor development requires international cooperation. \n \n5. \nRoad  maintenance  has  been  underfunded.  Many  sections  of  primary  roads  are  in  a \ndeteriorated  condition  and  some  may  require  reconstruction.  Expenditure  on  periodic  and \nroutine  maintenance  is  well  below  that  necessary  for  long-term  network  sustainability.  Non-\ncommon use and some urban roads are particularly at risk: some have no source of funding for \nmaintenance,  as  they  were  previously  under  the  responsibility  of  enterprises  now  closed. \nAlthough ad hoc surveys are made by regional Uzavtoyul offices, there is no network condition \ndatabase for roads or bridges. This is urgently required. Only with comprehensive data can the \nextent  of  the  maintenance  backlog  be  quantified  and  a  prioritized  remedial  maintenance \nprogram be developed.  \n \n6. \nThe  road  system  is  not  user  friendly:  signposting  of  directions  and  distances  and  lane \nmarking  is  poor,  and  pedestrians  are  inadequately  protected.  Some  routes,  e.g.,  Karshi\u2013\nBukhara  and  Namangan\u2013A-373,  are  particularly  dangerous,  with  vertical  curvature  resulting  in \nnumerous blind hillcrests on fast sections. These are unmarked, with no warning signs or road \nmarkings  to  limit  overtaking.  Inexpensive  work  here  could  save  lives.  Accident  data  readily \navailable  in  most  countries\u2014the  number  of  fatalities,  serious  and  slight  injuries\u2014was \nunobtainable and the seriousness of the problem is unclear. Attention needs to be given to data \ncollection  and  analysis  to  facilitate  prioritizing  mitigation  measures.  With  low  traffic  volumes, \nspeeding,  even  in  the  centre  of  urban  areas,  is  a  major  problem.  Speed  limits  need  to  be \nreviewed for adequacy, then be more clearly signposted and be enforced.   \n \n \n \nThe  substantial  decline  in  transit  traffic  since  1998  suggests  the  potential  to  expand \n7. \ntransit  traffic.  The  decline  that  was  common  throughout  Central  Asia  resulted  in  a  general \nreduction  of  international  trade.  Political  and  security  problems  since  1998  have  resulted  in \nborder closures or restrictions limiting recovery. The key challenge is to redevelop transit traffic. \n \n8. \nIt  is  important  for  trade  security  to  have  access  to  alternative  international  corridors. \nOptions  to  the  north  are  limited,  with  transit  through  Kazakhstan  unavoidable.  If  the  improved \nsituation in Afghanistan is sustained, further options are available, such as the Termez-Herat to \n\nTransit Traffic \n\n2.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n3. \n\nTransit Costs \n\nIslam  Qala  route  for  transit  to  Iran/Turkey  bypassing  Turkmenistan.  The  development  of  links \nthrough corridor RC2 using Irkestan or the Kulna Pass to the Karakorum Highway would reduce \ndependence on Kazakhstan for traffic to the People\u2019s Republic of China via Khorgos. \n \nThere  is  international  competition  for  transit  traffic.  The  Niznhy  Pianj\u2013Dushanbe\u2013Osh\u2013\n9. \nBishkek\u2013Almaty corridor could in future compete with the Dushambe/Termez\u2013Tashkent\u2013Almaty \ncorridor. Improvement of the Osh\u2013Bishkek route has already reduced the need for Kyrgyz traffic \nto transit Uzbekistan, even in winter. \n \n \n \n10. \nA key factor in the economics of a corridor is the level of transit fees, requiring a balance \nbetween fully recovering the costs occasioned by transiting vehicles and discouraging use of the \ncorridor. Uzbekistan is in a favorable position, with multiple corridors, but alternatives are being \ndeveloped. \n \n11. \nFees  for  foreign  transporters  are  quite  high:  $400  for  transit,  plus  $90  for  insurance, \nalthough Commonwealth of Independent States transporters have lower preferential rates. With \na market share for Uzbek transporters of only around 25% of international traffic and over 80% \nof  transit  traffic  being  carried  in  Turkish  and  Iranian  trucks,  substantial  revenue  is  generated \nfrom  foreign  transporters.  Neighboring  countries  also  have  high  fees,  and  the  combined  fees \nsignificantly increase transport costs in the region. There has been a decline of around 60% in \nthe  number  of  transiting  Turkish  and  Iranian  trucks.  While  this  is  partly  due  to  economic \nchanges,  with  Kazakhstan  for  example  sourcing  more  traffic  via  the  Russian  Federation, \ntransporters consider the high transit fees to have been a factor. There are market pressures on \ntransit fees: transporters will use the most cost-effective routes. \n \n \n \nDespite  significant  improvements,  transit  trade  facilitation  remains  complex  and  time-\n12. \nconsuming,  especially  for  vehicles  without  Transports  Internationaux  Routiers  (TIR)  Carnets.1 \nThe  combination  of  transposing  documentation  at  each  border,  different  documentary \nrequirements, a high percentage of physical examination of goods and payment of transit and \nother  fees  all  mean  border  delays.  Despite  substantial  investment  in  trade  facilitation  and \ncustoms cooperation programs, improvements in border processing over the last 10 years have \nbeen  limited.  The  Customs  Office  has  an  investment  plan  in  border  post  development  at  key \ncrossings. \n \nD.  \n \n13. \nRoad  sector  reform  has  been  progressing  significantly  since  2003.  Reform  measures \ninclude  (i)  sector  unbundling  by  separating  road  transport  operation  and  road  construction;  \n(ii)  institutional  reform  by  creating  the  Uzbek  Association  of  Transport  and  Transport \nCommunications,  the  Road  Board,  and  the  Road  Fund,  and  by  restructuring  Uzavtoyul;  and \n(iii) promotion of competitive bidding for road construction, reconstruction, and repair works.  \n \nEstablishment  of  Uzavtoyul  and  the  Road  Fund.  The  Road  Fund,  an  independent \n14. \nstate  financial  institution,  was  established  in  1993  to  ensure  financing  for  the  design, \n\nProgress on Road Sector Reform \n\nBorder Crossing \n\n4.  \n\n                                                 \n1 The  TIR  (Transports  Internationaux  Routiers)  system  relies  on  a  document  known  as  the  \"TIR  Carnet\"  which  is \nprinted and distributed by the Geneva-based International Road Transport Union for issue to the carnet users by \nthe  national  guarantee  associations  which  are  authorized  for  this  purpose  by  the  contracting  parties\u2019 \nadministrations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nconstruction,  reconstruction,  repair,  and  maintenance  of  common  use  roads,  as  well  as  to \nensure efficient functioning of the road sector. 2  \n \n15. \nThe Government reorganized the state joint stock company (SJSC) on construction and \noperation of roads to become SJSC Uzavtoyul3 to improve the road construction management \nsystem; further develop modern network of common use roads; reduce redundant management \nstructures;  and  enhance  the  productivity  of  resources  allocated  for  maintenance,  repair, \nreconstruction,  and  construction  of  common  use  roads.  The  provincial  and  district-based  road \nconstruction  organizations  were  set  up  under  Uzavtoyul.  The  Road  Fund  under  MOF  was  set \nup, replacing the previous one. The function of collection and control of funds of the Road Fund \nwas assigned to the State Tax and Customs Committees. \n \nUzavtoyul was reorganized in 2003, pursuant to presidential decree UP-3292 (2003), to \n16. \nensure  efficient  maintenance,  repair,  reconstruction,  and  construction  of  primary  roads.4 The \nRoad Fund\u2019s function was expanded to cover outsourcing of reconstruction and repair works of \ncommon  use  roads  through  competitive  bidding  to  ensure  effective  utilization  of  government \nfinances and to enhance the efficiency.5 \n \n17. \nOutsourcing  of  Road  Works.  To  ensure  quality  control  of  road  construction  and \nmaintenance,  outsourcing  for  reconstruction  and  repair  works  through  competition  was \nintroduced. 6  The  Government  also  improved  the  procedure  for  design,  construction,  and \nreconstruction of primary roads; and optimized the Road Fund\u2019s financing.7 Performance-based \ncontracts were used for routine maintenance works. \n\n \n18. \nQuality  Control  of  Road  Works.  The  Government  also  established  a  classification  of \nrepair and maintenance works for common use roads, and a mechanism for quality control and \nacceptance of roadworks.8 \n\n \n19. \nRestructuring of Uzavtoyul. In 2006, Uzavtoyul was assigned as an authorized agency \nof state administration of primary roads. Specialized enterprises responsible for maintenance of \ninternational  and  national  roads  were  set  up  under  Uzavtoyul. 9  Territorial  subsidiary  road \nconstruction  enterprises  under  Uzavtoyul  were  also  reorganized.  Furthermore,  specialized \nmaintenance enterprises to maintain bridge facilities on the primary roads and other specialized \nenterprises were also established.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 334 dated 5 July 1997 on establishment of \n\nthe Road Fund. \n\n3 Decree  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  UP-3292  dated  19  August  2003  on  improvement  of  the \n\nmanagement system for construction and operation of common use roads. \n\n4  Resolution of Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 361 dated 21 August 2003 on issues of activity \n\norganization of SJSC Uzvatoyul and the Road Fund under MOF. \n\n5 Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan PP-299 dated 3 March 2006 on measures for strengthening \ncontrol  over  volumes  and  quality  of  road  construction  works  and  approval  of  the  roads  construction  program  in \n2006. \n\n6    Resolution  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  No.  266  dated  1  January  2006  on \nimprovement of organization and assurance of quality control in construction and operation of common use roads. \n7   Resolution  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  PP-499  dated  25  October  2006  on  measures  for  improvement  of  the \n\nprocedure for design, construction, and reconstruction of common use roads. \n\n8    Resolution  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  No.  266  dated  1  January  2006  on \nimprovement of organization and assurance of quality control in construction and operation of common use roads.  \n9   Resolution  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  No.  511  dated  14  November  2006  on  measures  for \n\nimprovement of the organizational structure of SJSC Uzavtoyul. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nInvestment Plan. The concept for development of common use roads of the Republic of \n20. \nUzbekistan  in  2007\u20132010  and  long-term  perspective  was  approved 10  to  ensure  further \ndevelopment  of  common  use  roads  that  meet  high  international  requirements  and  standards; \nensure  all-year  efficient  international,  transit  and  intra-republican  freight,  and  passengers  road \ntransport  services;  and  to  optimize  economic  relations  between  participants  of  the  investment \nprocess in road construction \n \n21. \nSeparation  of  Authority.  Separation  of  authority  in  managing  primary  roads  was \nestablished in 2006. The Road Fund is responsible for budgeting for international and national \nprimary  roads.  Responsibility  for  managing  local  primary  roads  falls  under  district  or  regional \nhokimiyats (governments). \n \nE.  \n \n22. \nA  new  road  law  introducing  toll  roads  and  private  sector  operations  in  road  operations \nwas enacted in 2007.

Since  becoming  operational  in  March  2006,  the  Road  Fund  has  been  primarily \nconcerned with the procurement of roads works contracts. The programming of works is carried \nout based on ad hoc surveys, and does not reflect road traffic and road condition throughout the \nnetwork adequately. Road Fund staff has been introduced to the asset management approach \nbased on the Highway  Development and Management Model 4 (HDM-4) widely utilized in the \ndeveloping world, so it is now considered appropriate to install modern transport planning and \nhighway engineering approaches.  \n \n22. \nA  team  of  consultants  is  required  to  help  strengthen  the  Road  Fund\u2019s  capacity  in  road \nsector  planning  and  management,  and  prepare  it  to  adopt  a  modern  asset  management \napproach to one of Uzbekistan\u2019s most valuable capital assets. The Road Fund will establish a \nroadworks planning unit after completion of this support component. \n \n23. \nThe objective of the technical assistance is to enable the Road Fund to raise the general \nstandards  of  condition  and  capacity  of  the  network    through  utilization  of:  (i)  systematic  road \ntraffic  censuses,  and  transport  planning  and  highway  techniques;  (ii)  scientifically-based \nmonitoring of road surface condition (roughness) and roadbed conditions (structural number) on \na  regular  basis  so  that  the  status  of  the  entire  network  is  known  with  a  reasonable  degree  of \ncertainty on a continuous basis; (iii) prioritization of  road periodic maintenance and construction \nworks  utilizing  HDM-4,    in  light  of  current  and  projected  available  financial  resources  to  be \ncarried  out  every  3  years  on  a  rolling  basis;  and  (iv)  appropriately  designed  and  maintained \ndatabases to support the above activities.   \n \n \n \n24. \n \n\nThe consultants will carry out the following tasks: \n\nScope of Services  \n\n2. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nReview the current road sector planning and financing system. \nAssess  the  Road  Fund  financing  system  and  study  the  impact  of  possible \napplication of road user charges, tolling system, and asset management systems \nincluding, in the longer term, public-private partnerships. \nAssess  institutional  framework  of  the  road  sector  and  prepare  an  institutional \ndevelopment strategy focusing on (a) the need for a road agency, and (b) ways \nof  introducing  private  sector  competition  in  the  provision  and  maintenance  of \nroads.  \nIntroduce computerized road sector planning and management based on HDM-4. \nIntroduce  transport  planning  tools,  including  transport  models,  to  address \nemerging road capacity constraint issues.  \nDevelop database systems to support (iii) and (iv) above.  \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  Develop manual for systems application. \n(viii)  Purchase and set up the systems. \n(ix) \n\nUndertake  a  pilot  data  collection  exercise,  including  appraisal  utilizing  HDM-4 \nand the transport model for selected road links. \nProvide  staff  training  and  study  tours  to  transport  planning  and  highway \nengineering centers of excellence. \nPrepare  long-term  program  for  countrywide  application  of  road  condition  and \nroad link flow databases. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n41\n\n(xii) \n\nFormalize transport planning and highway engineering and planning through the \nestablishment of a Road Planning Unit.  \n\n3.  \n\nInput  \n\n \n \n \nThe  services  will  be  carried  out  by  consulting  firms  to  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \n25. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.

The \nProject will comprise reconstruction of the following two sections of the A-380 to meet the two-\nlane international design standard: \n \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nSection 1: kilometer (km) 876\u2013916 (40 km) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan. \nSection  2:  km  490\u2013581  (91  km)  in  Khorezm  Province  and  the  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan. \n\n \nThe without-project case reflects expected conditions in the absence of the Project, with \n2. \nmaintenance  sufficient  only  to  hold  the  road  in  its  present  condition.  The  with-project  case \ninvolves  initial  investment  followed  by  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  but  with  expenditure \nand frequency of periodic maintenance economically optimum for predicted road conditions and \ntraffic flows. \n \n3. \nThe  analysis  is  conducted  by  using  the  Highway  Development  and  Management \nModel 4  (HDM-4).  It  predicted  average  travel  speed,  pavement  roughness,  agency  costs,  and \nroad user costs. It also calculated the economic viability of road sections. \n \n4. \nThe  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs,  including  physical \ncontingencies.  Price  escalation  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  were \nexcluded.  All  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  constant  mid-2007  prices.  The  economic \nanalysis covers the construction period of 4 years plus 20 years of operation and maintenance \n(O&M).  Economic  analysis  is  conducted  using  border  price  numeraire.  A  standard  conversion \nfactor for non-tradable goods was estimated and applied to calculate the economic price of non-\ntradable  goods.  The  shadow  wage  rates  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  are  estimated  by \ncomparing  the  average  labor  wage  in  the  region  and  the  project  labor  wage,  taking  into \nconsideration  the  existing  unemployment  rate,  and  are  adjusted  by  the  standard  conversion \nfactor.  The  net  present  value  (NPV)  at  a  12%  discount  factor  and  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) were calculated to evaluate the economic viability of the Project. \n \n2.  \n \na.  \n \n \n \n5. \nClassified  traffic  counts were  carried  out  over  24  hours  on  sections  of  the  project  road \naway from the influence of towns and cities between May and June 2007 and are summarized \nin Table A9.1.  \n \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nExisting Traffic \n\nTable A9.1: Traffic Count Summary (2007)  \n \n\nRoad Section \n\nBuses \n\nCars \n\nOthers \n\nTotal \n\nDomestic \nTrucks \n\nInternational \nTrucks \n\nKhorezm (km 481) \n\n1,066 \n\nKarakalpakstan (km 886) \n\n164 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n445 \n\n58 \n\n34\n1 \n13\n0 \n\n67 \n\n2 \n\n1,924 \n\n364 \n\nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant\u2019s traffic count. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOverall Traffic Forecasts \n\nb. \n \n6. \nRoad  traffic  forecast  contains  normal  traffic,  diverted  traffic,  and  generated  traffic.

It \nis  estimated  that  10%  of  tonnage  on  the  Nukus\u2013Oasis  line,  running  parallel  to  the  A-380  and \ncurrently  transporting  about  1.72  million  metric  tons  per  year,  will  be  diverted  to  the  improved   \nA-380,  resulting  in  an  additional  121  heavy  trucks  per  day  by  2015.  An  additional  57  heavy \ntrucks are expected from the Northern Route by 2015.  \n \nGenerated  traffic  has  been  assumed  at  about  20%  of  the  flow  of  forecast  normal \n8. \ndomestic  traffic  once  all  sections  of  the  A-380  have  been  rehabilitated  by  2011.

The VOC \u2013 international \nroughness  index  (IRI)  equations  calculated  by  the  HDM-4  were  utilized  in \nestimating  benefits.  The  IRI  of  the  project  road  is  estimated  at  12.  Following \nreconstruction, the IRI is assumed to be 3, which will be back to 4 before the next \nscheduled periodic maintenance intervention in year 6 lowers it to 3.  \nDomestic  generated  traffic  benefits,  assumed  to  be  equal  to  50%  of  the  benefit \naccruing  to  domestic  users  of  the  A-380  highway.  Domestic  generated  traffic  is \nestimated at 20% of existing traffic by 2015.1 \nBenefits  to  road  traffic  diverting  from  the  Northern  Route,  conservatively  valued \nat $700/truck trip.  \nBenefits  to  small  rail  consignments  diverted  by  shippers  from  the  railway  to \nbenefit  from  the  quicker  road  service,  valued  at  half  the  rate  of  the  benefit \naccruing to domestic road users.  \nRoad  accident  savings,  estimated  by  assuming  a  reduction  in  accident  losses \nonce  the  A-380  highway  is  improved.  Annual  losses  in  property  damage  and \nforgone production caused by traffic accidents countrywide are estimated at 3% \nof  GDP. 2 The  annual  traffic  accident  costs  of  the  project  road  are  estimated \nbased on the percentage of annual vehicle-km of vehicles along the project road \nto the total national vehicle-km. A 10% reduction in losses was then assumed to \naccrue to improvement of the project road.    \n\n \nb. \n\nProject Cost \n\nThe civil works will be implemented over a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011. The Project \n10. \nprovides  sufficient  road  capacity  to  cope  with  the  forecast  traffic  up  to  2031,  with  an  overlay \nplanned for every 6 years. \n \n11. \nend of evaluation period is estimated at 20% of the initial investment.  \n \n\nThe project cost (taxes excluded) is summarized in Table A9.4.

Chester; Litman. 2007. Generated Traffic and Induced Travel. Victoria.; \nand  Goodwin.  2004.  Empirical  Evidence  on  Induced  Traffic.  Oxford.  ADB\u2019s  AFG:  North-South  Corridor  Project \n(2006) also adopted the same assumption for generated traffic. The benefit estimation is based on Rule of a Half \n(World Bank\u2019s Transport Note TRN-11, 2005). \n\n2 See  for  instance  the  Final  Report  of  ADB  TA  6195  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study, \nDecember 2005.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n45\n\nc. \n\nResults of Economic Evaluation \n\n12. \nA summary of the economic analysis is presented in Table A9.5. The road development \ncomponent is economically viable since it produces an EIRR of 17% for section 1 and 34% for \nsection  2.  The  difference  between  the  EIRR  for  the  two  sections  is  due  to  a  considerable \ndisparity between existing and projected traffic flows. The current and projected traffic in section \n2  is  much  higher  than  in  section  1.  The  Project  will  also  (i)  provide  better  access  to  social \nservices such as health care centers, schools, and markets; (ii) contribute to promoting related \ndevelopment  in  the  region  and  provide  local  benefits  to  the  rest  of  society;  (iii)  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s  broader  strategy  of  developing  strategic  corridors;  and  (iv)  be  strategically \nimportant to international trade.  \n                                           \n\nTable A9.5: Summary of Economic Analysis for Civil Works \n\nSection 1: Km 876-916 \n\nSection 2: Km 490-581 \n\nTotal Benefit \n\n($ \u2019000) \n\n  \n\nTotal Benefit \n($ \u2019000) \n\n  \nYear \n  \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n\nTotal Cost \n($ \u2019000) \n7,424.2 \n14,262.3 \n3,738.4 \n230.5 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n2,474.2 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n8,907.1 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n6,185.5 \n24.4 \n24.4 \n(4,924.1) \n\n  \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n\n3,424.4 \n3,859.9 \n4,198.7 \n4,565.8 \n4,952.8 \n5,393.9 \n6,030.9 \n6,509.4 \n6,967.6 \n7,446.1 \n7,970.9 \n8,712.5 \n9,275.9 \n9,797.0 \n10,319.6 \n10,870.2 \n11,607.6 \n12,188.8 \n12,802.2 \n13,357.2 \n13,835.3 \n\nTotal Cost \n($ \u2019000) \n448.0 \n14,673.3 \n20,958.0 \n18,351.8 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n5,235.3 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n18,847.1 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n13,088.3 \n55.4 \n55.4 \n(6,849.7) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n21,514.4 \n22,900.0 \n24,365.3 \n25,878.2 \n27,055.4 \n29,283.9 \n31,548.1 \n33,166.6 \n34,878.2 \n36,159.9 \n38,169.4 \n40,746.8 \n42,498.2 \n44,184.5 \n45,492.2 \n46,791.1 \n48,933.8 \n51,706.1 \n53,475.1 \n55,088.0 \n\nEIRR \n(%) \nNPV ($ \nmillion) \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\n10.2 \n\n17 \n\n  \n\n \n\n34 \n\n104.7 \n\nd. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  impact  of changes  on  key  parameters \n13. \ndetermining project costs and benefits. The road agency cost increase of 20% will reduce the \nEIRR from 17% to 14.5% for section 1 and 34% to 30% for section 2. Meanwhile, the decrease \nin  traffic  by  20%  in  both  sections  would  bring  down  the  average  EIRR  from  17%  to  13%  for \nsection 1 and from 34% to 24% for section 2. If road accident savings are excluded, the EIRR \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nbecomes 16% for section 1 and 22% for section 2. If generated (induced) traffic is ignored, the \nEIRR becomes 15% for section 1 and 23% for section 2. The economic analysis and sensitivity \ntest concluded that the road development component is economically justified. \n \nB. \n\nRoad Sector Sustainability Component \n\n \n\nThe  general  principles  of  economic  analysis  are  similar  to  those  for  the  road \n\n14. \ndevelopment component. \n \n15. \nThe  road  equipment  will  be  used  for  road  works  across  the  country  over  the  lifetime \nperiod.  Under  the  with-project  scenario,  purchase  of  new  equipment  is  considered  with  well-\nplanned and managed road maintenance. Under the without-project case, the roadworks will be \nimplemented  using  the  existing  equipment  available  in  the  country  with  lack  of  road \nmaintenance  planning  and  management  capacity.  The  net  (incremental)  benefit  would  be  the \nVOC  savings,  time  value  savings,  and  accident  savings  between  the  with-project  (new \nequipment purchased) and without-project (using the existing equipment) scenarios. Under the \nwithout-project  case,  the  average  pavement\u2019s  IRI  is  estimated  higher  than  that  of  the  with-\nproject.  The  higher  average  IRI  will  result  in  higher  VOC,  average  travel  time,  and  accident \nrates. \n \n16. \nThe incremental cost would be the cost difference between capital investment and O&M \nof  the  new  equipment  (with  the  Project)  and  O&M  of  the  existing  equipment  (without  the \nProject). The equipment cost is estimated to account for 37.5% of total reconstruction costs. \n \n17. \nThe  equipment  is  assumed  to  be  working  on  about  3.4%  of  the  international  road \nnetwork  and  about  2%  of  the  total  road  network  per  annum.  The  savings  in  the  10  years  the \nequipment will be utilized are calculated by the HDM-4 model, given the roughness reductions. \nThe EIRR for the equipment was estimated at 33%, which is economically viable (Table A9.6). \nUnder the worst scenario, where the total cost increases by 20% and the incremental benefits \ndecreases  by  20%,  the  EIRR  will  be  about  20%\u2014still  above  the  threshold  of  12%.

The  costs  include  land  acquisition,  capital  costs,  and \nincremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  (O&M).  Interest  during  implementation  was \nexcluded.  No  salvage  value  was  considered  at  the  end  of  equipment  life  assumed  to  be \n10 years.  The  anticipated  capital  mix  of  debt  to  equity  was  used  for  estimating  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital. Financial benefits are derived from the average equipment hire charges \nbased on full cost recovery. The financial net present value and financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) are calculated on an after-tax basis in real terms. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n3. \nThe road sector sustainability component covers investments to improve the operational \nefficiency,  fair  distribution,  and  arm\u2019s-length  transaction  of  equipment  procured  under  ADB \nfinancing. The road equipment pool company (REPC) will be incorporated in June 2008, and it \nwill implement the equipment procurement.  \n \n4. \nThe  FIRR  was  calculated  based  on  (i)  the  estimated  250  kilometer  (km)  per  annum \nweighted average construction and maintenance works; (ii) a 90% productivity factor; (iii) a 10% \nO&M cost of capital cost for a period of 20 years, including a 1-year preparation period and 2-\nyear equipment procurement period; and (iv) no residual value at the end of year 10. Equipment \nreplacement  costs  were  included  in  the  computation  of  the  FIRR  at  the  end  of  the  10-year \nequipment life. The equipment hire charge was calculated to cover capital costs (depreciation, \nO&M,  and  debt  service)  with  a  15%  return  on  equity  at  about  $80,000  per  unit.  The  resulting \nFIRR is 12.6% (Table A10.1).  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

The \nGovernment is committed to the establishment of the REPC, which will be incorporated \nas  a  corporate  legal  entity..  The  REPC  will  own,  manage,  and  maintain  the  road \nequipment  assets  financed  under  the  Project  and  be  accountable  for  the  associated \nliabilities.  The  estimated  asset  value\u2014consisting  of  debt  financed  $55.31  million1 road \nequipment  and  capital  contribution  by  the  Government  of  $13.8  million  in  the  form  of \nfacilities, plant, and property. The Government will take all the necessary legal measures \nand  actions  to  set  up  a  new  entity  for  this  purpose.  The  projected  income  statement, \nbalance sheet, and cash flow statement are in Table A11.1. \n  \nB.  \n \n2. \nfollowing: \n \n\nMajor  assumptions  for  the  REPC\u2019s  projected  financial  statements  include  the \n\nMajor Assumptions \n\nThe  pro  forma  projected  financial  statements  of  the  REPC  are  prepared  for \nFY2008\u2013FY2018 and are shown in current terms in local currency.   \n\nThe  domestic  inflation  rates  are  assumed  at  8.2%  in  FY2008,  7.5%  in \nFY2009,  7.3%  in  FY2010,  and  7.0%  from  FY2011  onward,  in  line  with  the \ndomestic cost escalation factors 2007\u20132011 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The international inflation rate is assumed at 0.8% per annum during \nthe period of analysis. \n\nThe exchange rate used is SUM1,280 to $1.00 for FY2007, adjusted during \nthe forecast period based on the differential between the assumed domestic \nand international inflation rates. \n\nThe  estimated  time  for  procurement  of  road  equipment  is  24  months.  It  is \nassumed  that  the  REPC  will  resume  operations  in  FY  2009  and  be  fully \noperational  in  FY2010.  Operating  revenues  are  generated  from  equipment \nhire  fees.  Equipment  hire  fees  are  estimated  on  a  full  cost  recovery  basis \n(i.e.,  depreciation,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  debt  service \nallowing  return  on  equity  of  15%).  About  250  kilometers  (km)  per  annum  is \nassumed  to  be  covered  with  the  equipment.  A  90%  productivity  factor  is \nused.  The  average  equipment  hire  fee  is  estimated  at  about  $80,000/km \n(SUM102 million/km) and is adjusted to reflect local inflation. They are geared \nto meet a minimum 80:20 debt-to-equity ratio and 80% operating ratio.  \n\n(v) \n\nOperating  expenses  consist  of  (i)  O&M  (salaries  and  general  administration \nexpenses), and (ii) depreciation/major repairs of existing and newly acquired \nassets.  Administration  costs  are  estimated  at  6%  of  the  REPC\u2019s  annual \nrevenue.  The  average  labor  cost  is  projected  at  3%  of  gross  fixed  assets, \nincreasing in line with the local inflation. Depreciation of assets is calculated \n\n                                                 \n1 The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will onlend $55.31 million to the REPC.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n(vi) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n51\n\non  a  straight-line  basis  at  10%,  depreciating  the  assets  over  its  economical \nlife of 10 years. The repair and maintenance costs are assumed to be 1% of \ngross fixed assets initially, and are projected to increase over time to 4%. \n\nThe REPC is expected to receive the same benefits as other road companies \n(private  and  public),  which  are  exempt  from  payments  of  corporate  taxation \nand customs duty of 20% on the import of equipment and machinery.   \n\n \n(vii)  Capital  expenditure  on  road  maintenance  equipment  is  based  on  estimates \nfrom the feasibility studies financed by ADB.2 Some 163 units are assumed to \nbe  procured  in  FY2008  plus  136  units  in  FY2009,  totaling  299 units  of \nequipment. \n\nInventories  represent  1  month  of  repair  value  and  maintenance  costs,  and \nare assumed to contain all necessary spares and tools for maintenance of the \nequipment. \n\nA  minimum  debt-to-equity  ratio  of  80:20  is  assumed.  The  Government  is \ncommitted  to  transfer  assets  that  are  relevant  to  REPC  operations,  in  the \nform of equity contribution assumed at $13.8 million, representing about 20% \nof the REPC\u2019s total assets.  \n\nFinancial charges are assumed to be paid as accrued during each year. They \nare calculated on the average balance of outstanding loan liability during the \nyear. The ADB ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan of $55.31 million will be \nonlent to the REPC at an additional premium of 0.2%. The same repayment \nperiod  is  assumed  to  apply:  4-year  grace  period  and  20-year  debt \namortization  schedule.  The  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  is \nestimated  at  5.6%  (6  months\u2019  LIBOR  at  5.0%  as  of  22  October  2007) \nincluding 0.6% fixed spread and 0.35% commitment charge on undisbursed \nloan amount.

Financial  management  assessment  questionnaires  and  field \ninterviews were used. Available public financial management assessment diagnostic tools such \nas  the  World  Bank\u2019s  comprehensive  country  financial  accountability  assessment1 and  public \nexpenditure review2, and ADB assistance programs,3 were further reviewed.  \n \n2. \nIt  is  concluded  that  the  Road  Fund  currently  meets  ADB\u2019s  minimum  financial \nmanagement requirements. The Road Fund has satisfactory financial management capability to \n(i) record required financial transactions and balances, (ii) provide regular and reliable financial \nstatements  and  monitoring  reports,  and  (iii)  safeguard  the  financial  assets.  A  summary  of \nfinancial management assessment findings is in Table A12.  \n\nTable A12: Summary Financial Management Assessment \n\n \nParticulars \n \nA. Executing Agency \n\nConclusions \n \n\nThe Road Fund is a separate entity, \naccountable to the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF). It has significant experience in \nmanaging and implementing large-scale \nprojects. However, it has not implemented \nany project with the participation of \ninternational financial \ninstitutions/multinational development \nbanks.   \n\nB.  Funds Flow \nArrangements \n\nThe Road Fund\u2019s funds flow arrangements \nare reliable, predictable, and secure. The \nRoad Fund has enough capability to work \nunder the proposed funds flow \narrangements acceptable to ADB. For the \nproject funds, flow arrangements are \nidentified in consultation with Road Fund \nrepresentatives. \n\n \nActions \n\nDuring the project \npreparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA) financed \nby the Asian Development \nBank (ADB),4 a series of \nprocurement seminars was \nconducted. The project \ndesign incorporates the \nsupport of a procurement \nconsultant for the \nestablishment of procedures \nand preparation of \nprocurement documentation \nto ensure all the ADB \nguidelines are followed. \nThe Road Fund and MOF \nshould ensure the timely \navailability of counterpart \nfunding in accordance with \nthe project financing plan. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 World Bank.

The \nproject implementation unit (PIU) scheme \nrequires additional hire for the Project.  \n \n\nThe Road Fund\u2019s accounting policy is \nbased on the Uzbekistan National \nAccounting Standards, which are \nprogressively being modernized in \naccordance with International Accounting \nStandards.  \nThere is no internal audit unit within the \nstructure of the Road Fund.  \n \n\nThe Road Fund is audited annually by the \nChamber of Accounts. In the case of other \nprojects in the country, the PIU will be \naudited by independent external auditors on \nan annual basis.  \n \n\nThe Road Fund reports comply with the \nreporting requirements of MOF, Ministry of \nEconomy, State Tax Committee, and other \ngovernment bodies.  \n \nThe Road Fund operates the \n1S Accounting system budget module. \nReports are prepared with the help of the \nprogram and using spreadsheets. The \nprogram is not costly and is not a \ncomplicated system, which suits the \nrequirements of the Project, although some \nreports cannot be generated automatically. \nMany ADB-financed projects in the country \nuse this system. \n\nAppendix 12              55  \n\n \nActions \n\nTraining and workshops on \nADB financial management \nprocedures will be provided. \nIt is expected that on-the-job \ntrainings provided by the PIU \nstaff of other ongoing \nprojects will also be \nbeneficial. \nFor the PIU, a separate \naccounting policy and \nfinancial management \nmanual will be established in \naccordance with ADB and \nMOF requirements. \nNo further action is \nnecessary. However, options \ninclude either involving an \ninternal commission or \nappointment of an internal \nauditor. \nExternal audit of the project \naccounts will be done in \naccordance with the \nInternational Standards on \nAuditing by an external \nauditor acceptable to ADB. \nSample terms of reference \nfor auditors were sent to the \nRoad Fund. \n \nAcceptable reporting \nrequirements for the PIU \nshall be stipulated in the \nLoan Agreement between \nADB and the Government.  \nThe Road Fund should \nensure that a satisfactory \nfinancial management \nsystem is maintained \nthroughout the duration of \nthe Project. The                \n1S-Accounting program will \nbe installed at the PIU for the \nproject needs. \n \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and project preparatory technical assistance consultants. \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Uzbekistan: Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Regional Road Project \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Lending \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\nCWRD/CWID \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  interim  poverty  reduction  strategy  for  Uzbekistan  (2005\u20132010)  identifies  four  pillars  for  reducing  poverty  incidence: \n(i) high  economic  growth  rates  by  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  accelerating  structural  reforms,  (ii)  human \ndevelopment  and  social  protection,  (iii)  reduced  interregional  inequalities  in  living  standards,  and  (iv)  improved  environment \nprotection. The strategy takes into account differences in the social and economic development of the regions throughout the \ncountry.1 Within the framework of the strategy, two economic policy objectives are set: (i) reduction of regional differences in \nliving standards, and (ii) creation of conditions to increase the economic potential of the regions. The instruments to achieve \nthese  objectives  are  as  follows:  national  social  and  investment  programs,  and  programs  for  the  establishment  and \nmodernization of infrastructure, as well as reform of the local authority and decentralization of public administration. The steps \nto provide stable social and economic development in the regions include provision of government support and stimulation of \nthe  comprehensive  development  of  the  regions  regarding  the  development  of  their  industrial  infrastructure  facilities, \nimprovement  of  their  investment  attractiveness,  and  placement  of  small  manufacturing  enterprises  in  rural  districts.  The \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy clearly indicates the importance of infrastructure development.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  country  and  strategy  program  for  Uzbekistan  (2006\u20132010)2  identified  four  strategic \npriorities:  (i)  accelerate  environmentally  sustainable  rural  development,  (ii)  enable  private  sector  development,  (iii)  promote \nregional  cooperation  in  transport  and  customs  transit,  and  (iv)  build  human  capital  of  the  poor.  It  prioritizes  infrastructure, \nincluding  road  development,  to  help  the  Government  achieve  its  development  objective  and  reduce  poverty.  The  Project, \nwhich is included in the country strategy and program, has two major components: road development and road sustainability. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  increasing  trade  with  neighboring  countries.    It  is  also  expected  to  generate  new \ninitiatives and opportunities of economic activities. Improved connectivity and access to health center, schools, and markets \nemerged  as  a  major  priority  for  the  poor.  Rural\u2013urban  links,  promoted  through  improvements  of  highways,  contribute  to \nsupporting  greater  stability  of  income  and  increased  off-farm  employment  in  rural  areas.  In  the  case  of  the  desert \nenvironment, improvement of the road and its rehabilitation is a primary measure to reduce isolation, increase communication, \nand thus generate new opportunities; and to give the local poor the possibility to be involved in new initiatives outside planned \nagriculture production.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAfter  independence  in  1996,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  economic  growth  and  measures  taken  by  the  Government  have  led  to  positive \ntrends. The country started to recover from economic decline: life expectancy increased, infant and child mortality dropped, \nbasic education was introduced and illiteracy was eliminated, the gender gap in education fell, 95% of households own their \ndwellings, and the majority of rural households have access to plots. Nevertheless, despite a slowly declining poor population, \neconomic growth has not generated sufficient employment opportunities. According to the 2002 and 2003 household budget \nsurveys,  the  poverty  level  in  the  country  is  27.5%,  with  6.8  million  people  living  in  absolute  income  deprivation.3  Regional \nvariations in poverty remain high and rural  population has a higher rate of poverty\u201470% of the country\u2019s poor lives in rural \nareas and the rural poverty rate is 30.5% versus 22.5% in urban areas. The highest concentration of poor households is in the \nsouthern  and  northern  regions.  The  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan,  Namangan,  Kashkadarya,  and  Khorezm  have  the  highest \npoverty incidence. \n \nThe  Project  will  generate  nonquantifiable  economic  and  social  benefits.  Better  roads  will  likely  attract  additional  economic \nactivity and traffic, thus generating benefits to a wider circle of beneficiaries. Direct benefits of the Project include employment \nopportunities  in  civil  works.  Construction  will  create  temporary  jobs,  and  routine  maintenance  will  employ  unskilled  and \nsemiskilled  workers.  Women  will  be  encouraged  to  work  and  be  treated  equitably.  The  Project  will  provide  better  and \nimproved  conditions  for  all  road  users,  improved  conditions,  better  and  faster  access  to  health  centers  (especially  city \nhospitals in emergency cases), better access to education and to basic needs and markets, and better access to markets and \nimprovement of market relations. Indirect benefits  will include employment and business opportunities, such as restaurants. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n57\n\nOther private business opportunities are expected to emerge, such as vehicle-related services and small businesses.  \n\n2. Design Features  \n \nThe  Project  will  involve  civil  works  of  a  major  highway,  using  mostly  machinery  and  skilled  labor.  Only  a  limited  amount  of \nunskilled labor will be needed during construction. No specific pro-poor activities are planned in this Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  Project  covers  two  road  sections  located  in  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  Province.  The  main \nbeneficiaries of the Project will be road users and the secondary beneficiaries will be people living along the improved road. \nThe Project will reconstruct the existing roads within the current right-of-way owned by the Government.  \n \nThe Project concerns five villages, four of which are in the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The villages have changed from the \nsovkhoz  (state-operated  agricultural  estate)  system  to  shirkat  (agricultural  cooperatives)  system..  The  shirkat  farm  is \ntotally  irrigated  and  produces  three  crops:  cotton,  wheat,  and  rice.  Wheat  is  sold  according  to  state  quotas;  the  surplus  is \nshared  among  the  workers.  At  the  level  of  local  villagers,  these  changes  do  not  seem  to  have  any  effect.  They  are \nsharecroppers  and  must  produce  certain  amounts  of  yield.  One  village  is  located  in  Khorezm.  Most  of  the  villagers  work  in \nwater and gas reservoir pumps, small businesses, and animal husbandry. There are also employees of different companies \n(gas  company,  railway,  salt  quarry,  and  soda  plant)  and  about  100 pastoralists  in  the  project  area.  The  pastoral-nomads \nrepresent a group that is unknown because it is a new phenomenon.  \n \nRehabilitation of the road is seen by both local authorities and the population as a very positive action. They need the road for \neveryday life, for their security, and to improve their livelihoods. The road also represents new opportunities for business on \ndifferent levels\u2014for local women to sell their crafts and open new chayhonas (tea houses); for pastoralists to sell their animals \nand products more easily; and for the local population to have better access to health centers, education, and basic needs. \nFor  local  and  provincial  authorities,  the  improved  road  will  further  develop  markets  and  commerce,  transportation,  and \nbusiness opportunities. \n \nThere are neither resettlement issues  nor land  loss in the project area.  There  will  be  no land, housing, property,  or  income \nloss;  and  no  new  limitations  to  the  movement  of  villagers  and  pastoralists.  No  archeological  site,  cemetery,  or  other \nsocial/cultural  facilities  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  Village  inhabitants  and  pastoral  nomads  are  vulnerable,  but  their \nvulnerable situations are neither directly nor indirectly related to the project road. They will benefit from the Project.   \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation was conducted with stakeholders including the local population; the Road Fund, the Project\u2019s Executing Agency \n(EA); and district government officials. A meeting  was held  with the governor of Khorezm. Discussions also took place  with \nvillage  chairpersons  and  some  of  the  pastoral-nomads.  Most  of  the  fieldwork  was  based  on  qualitative  analysis  and  direct \nobservation.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \n \nWomen  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  rehabilitation  of  the  road  through  improved  access  to  basic  services  such  as  health, \neducation,  and  markets.

The  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination (SIEE), prepared by the project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA)  consultant  on  behalf  of  the  Republican  Road  Fund  (the  Road  Fund),  is  consistent \nwith the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines. The Project will comprise upgrading of two sections of national highway A-380, \nand will not involve realignment or construction of bypasses or diversions. As such, it does \nnot  fall  under  the  type  of  projects  that  require  an  environmental  assessment  based  on  the \nLaw  on  Ecological  Expertise,  2000. 1  Only  a  confirmation  that  project  activities  will  be \nconfined within the right-of-way and that no significant realignments or interference with any \nnatural habitat will take place is required.   \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  three  components:  (i)  road  construction;  (ii)  road  equipment \n2.  \nacquisition;  and  (iii)  advisory  support  for  the  introduction  of  a  comprehensive  road  sector \nplanning and management system; establishment of a road construction equipment unit; and \nprocurement of civil works, consultants, and equipment. The Project will involve resurfacing \nand  widening  of  two  sections  of  the  A-380  highway  totaling  131  kilometers  (km):  (i)  in \nKharezm Province (Section 1: 91 km), and (ii) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan (Section 2: \n40 km). Upgrading shall be confined within the existing 50-meter (m) right-of-way (25 m on \neither side of the road centerline). The main working width will be 8\u201310 m centered over the \nexisting  carriageway.  Construction  and  movement  of  materials  will  take  place  along  the \nhighway, so access roads will not be necessary. The Project will not involve land acquisition \nand resettlement. Rehabilitation works will require more than 6.6 million cubic meters (m3) of \nearthworks  for  subgrade,  shoulder,  and  carriageway  repair.  Site  works  are  expected  to \ncommence in late 2008, with actual work progressing for 3 years.   \n \nC. \n \nTopography and Geology. The topography of the land through which the two road \n3.  \nsections  pass  includes  mostly  desert  and  slightly  undulating  terrain,  as  found  at  the \nboundary  of  the  Amudarya  River  valley.  The  geology  of  the  area  consists  of  a  mixture  of \nsandstone and limestone, overlain with sand. Nearly all towns and villages in the vicinity of \nthe road are located in the irrigated river plain and the delta of the Amudarya, a minimum of \n5\u201310  km  away  from  the  road  right-of-way,  leaving  the  project  roadsides  almost  totally \nuninhabited.  Neither  of  the  project  road  sections  passes  across  or  close  to  the  river  valley \nproper. \n \nClimate,  Air  Quality,  and  Noise.  The  project  area  has  a  southern  temperate \n4.  \ncontinental  desert  climate,  with  extremely  hot  summer  temperatures  exceeding  45\u00b0C  and \nvirtually  no  rain.  December  through  February  is  the  winter  period,  with  temperatures \ndropping  below  \u201315\u00b0C,  but  more  often  around  the  freezing  point  or  above  0\u00b0C. \nTemperatures begin to climb in March, accompanied by occasional rain (200 millimeters or \nless)  and  sometimes  accompanied  by  flash  floods.  In  dry  desert  conditions,  the  daily \ntemperature  fluctuations  can  be  as  much  as  30\u00b0C.  Frequent  dust  storms  occur  during  the \nsummer  months  of  March  to  May  when  winds  exceeding  100  km/hour  generate  large \ndisturbances,  significantly  raising  the  levels  of  total  suspended  particulates  in  the  project \narea.  Fine  salt  is  also  dispersed  into  the  air  mass  during  such  storms.  Given  that  traffic  is \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n                                                 \n1   Included  in  the  New  Laws  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  Edition  23.  Amendments  were  published  in  the \n\nNarodnoye Slove in July 2000. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n \n\n61\n\nlight and there is no industry anywhere along the alignment\u2014except the Provincial Transport \nDepartment\u2019s  rock  crushing  and  batch  plant  facilities,  and  the  soda  mine  and  factory  at \nKm 916\u2014air remains relatively free from gaseous emissions. During the field investigation, \nno noise sensitive sites were identified along the alignment.  \n \nWater Resources. Aside from occasional rainfall and flash floods, the road does not \n5.  \npass over any surface water. The shallow groundwater acquifer is >25 m below the surface, \nsaline, and polluted. Because of intensive pesticide and fertilizer use, especially in Khorezm \nProvince and the Republic of Karakalpakstan, groundwater at a depth of 100\u2013150 m is also \ncontaminated. Groundwater for human consumption is scarce in the two project regions, with \nonly 22,000 m3/day and 33,000 m3/day available based on 2003 data.   \n \nFlora  and  Fauna.  The  ecological  zones  through  which  the  road  passes  is  the \n6.  \nQizylkum  desert  and  Ustiyurt  Plateau,  an  elevated  desert  region,  much  of  which  is \nsignificantly modified by past irrigated agriculture and livestock overgrazing. The project road \nruns along a sparsely vegetated semidesert area. Section 1 has no known environmentally \nsensitive  features  within  at  least  3  km  centered  over  the  road.  The  Amudarya  River  Basin \nForest Reserve is located at Km 677, more than 100 km away from section 1 and 200 km \nfrom section 2. There are no known sensitive species habitats for section 2, despite the fact \nthat  the  area  was  the  migratory  range  of  the  saiga  antelope  (an  endangered  species)  and \ngoitered  gazelle  (a  vulnerable  species)  prior  to  1980.  Since  that  time,  overhunting  and \nshrinking  of  the  Aral  Sea  has  decimated  the  saiga  population  such  that  only  10%  of  the \noriginal  numbers  remain.  There  is  no  danger  that  the  project  roadwork  will  in  any  way \ninterfere with these species. A less severe, but similar condition, affects the goitered gazelle. \nThere are other vulnerable birds and herptiles species in the general area, but they have not \nbeen  sighted  within  5  km  of  the  road  sections  by  environment  officials  of  Gozcompriroda \nNukus or Kungrad for over a decade. \n \nEconomic and Cultural Resources. The Republic of Karakalpakstan, where nearly \n7.  \nall the road improvements will take place, is sparsely populated (7.5 people/km2) and areas \nwithin the road right-of-way area are almost totally devoid of settlements. There is no human \nsettlement within the 50 m wide right-of-way along the entire project corridor. Some nomad \ncamps  and  a  few  road-toll  houses  are  located  some  distance  from  the  road.  A  number  of \nvillages  identified  in  the  social  assessment  report  are  located  5  km  or  more  from  the  road \nsections.  The  project  road  section  has  no  farming,  other  than  nomadic  sheep  and  cattle \nherding which has decreased the sparse grass cover, thereby increasing problems with sand \ndunes and erosion. The land is used almost totally for light grazing or is unused. Generally, \ntowns  near  the  project  road  have  electricity,  but  little  else.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \nRepublic  of  Karakalpakstan,  where  frequent  power  outages  are  experienced  and  basic \nhousehold services such as piped potable water or indoor toilet facilities do not exist.   \n \nTopraq Qala Fort, spread over a 120 m x 100 m area, is an adobe walled fortification \n8.  \nlocated  along  section  2 (km  887)  north  of  Kungrad  and  is  a  second  century  A.D.  structure \nfrom the Kushan period. Toprak Qala has no access or connection to the project road. The \nfort\u2019s  outer  mud  wall  boundary  is  located  about  150  m  from  the  A-380  highway.  Daud  Ata \nCemetery is also located along section 2 at km 889 on the west side of the A-380 highway. It \nis  actively  used  by  the  four  small  villages  located  to  the  east,  as  well  as  by  the  people  of \nKungrad. The cemetery entrance is located 50 m from the edge-of-pavement. On the Ustyurt \nPlateau, there are a series of other archaeological sites\u2014Kirqgiz Qalaa and Tesik Qalaa\u2014\ndating  from  the  same  period  as  Daud  Ata  Cemetery.  These  areas  are  known  only  from \nhistorical records, i.e., they have not been rediscovered. \n \nD. \n \nPre-Construction  Phase.  The  decision  to  restrict  the  road  upgrading  to  within  the \n9.  \nexisting right-of-way and carriageway will keep construction impacts to a minimum. Existing \n\nScreening Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ntransmission  lines  and  underground  gas  pipelines  are  located  outside  the  right-of-way.  A \nwork boundary of 25 m from the centerline of sections 1 and 2 will be defined using fencing \nto  ensure  that  construction  equipment  are  kept  within  the  work  sites.  The  Road  Fund  also \nplans to bring all construction materials to the construction area in bulk by railcar and from \nnearby intermodal terminals. Large trucks (up to 26 tons) will be used to transport materials \nto  the  construction  site.  Construction  vehicles  and equipment  will make  use  of  the existing \nhighway  such  that  no  new  access  roads  need  to  be  established.  As  part  of  the  detailed \ndesign work, areas along sections 1 and 2 that are prone to flash floods shall be identified by \nlocal road agency staff and these conditions shall be accommodated in the final design.  \n \nConstruction Phase. Road widening will require clearing of about 130 hectares (ha) \n10.  \nof  land  within  the  right-of-way.  Natural  vegetation  removed  during  construction  shall  be \nreplaced. Stabilization using reed mats and the planting of saksaul (Haloxylon sp.) seedlings \naccording to advice from the Uzbekistan Forestry Institute in Tashkent will be undertaken. It \nmay be possible to use waste sewage water to help with watering of revegetation sites. To \nprevent  wind  and  water  erosion,  revegetation  of  the  disturbed  areas  will  be  undertaken  as \nthe work proceeds and as soon as work on any given stretch is completed. During the initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE),  it  was  determined  that  a  saksaul  tree  nursery  was \nestablished  with  donor  assistance  (German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit or GTZ) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and \nthat trees are available for replanting purposes.  \n \nExtraction of sand and gravel in riverbeds shall be prohibited except (i) where there is \n11.  \nno  technically  and  economically  feasible  alternative;  and  (ii)  provided  specific  mitigation \nmeasures  are  implemented  to  minimize  impacts  on  river  morphology,  water  quality,  and \necosystems  (e.g.,  reduced  extraction  during  the  fish  spawning  period).  Materials  shall  be \nsourced from licensed quarry/borrow areas operations. Borrow pits shall be dewatered and \nfences shall be provided, as appropriate, to minimize health and safety risks. Large volumes \nof quarry rock, aggregate, and sand will be transported and stored near the roadworks. Work \nand  storage  areas  and  haul  routes  will  be  constantly  exposed  to  the  elements,  and  will \nprimarily create dust during the frequent windy conditions. Dust control will be very difficult \ngiven  the  scarcity  of  water.  Dust  at  work  and  materials  storage  sites  will  be  controlled  by \nwatering, using shallow aquifer saline water. Along the haul roads, provision of canopies on \nloaded  trucks  will  be  the  primary  mitigation  measure.  Any  spills  on  the  haul  roads  will  be \ncleaned  up  by  the  contractor  within  a  24-hour  period.  It  is  assumed  that  the  new  mobile \nplants purchased as part of this loan will have dust suppression technology installed and as \nsuch  will  help  to  control  the  dust  plumes  that  usually  come  from  crushing  operations. \nEmissions should be kept to a minimum given that state-of-the-art machinery will be used. \nInspection  and  regular  reporting  will  ensure  that  equipment  is  maintained  to  specifications \nand  that  dust  is  carefully  and  continuously  managed.  Dust  control  will  be  particularly \nstringent  for  mobile  crushing  plants,  which  can  produce  large  plumes  of  fine  dust  that  can \nbecome airborne many kilometers downwind of their location. \n \nSediment-laden drainage water is not an issue since there is no surface water body \n12.  \ninto which it may drain. Runoff will simply percolate into the surrounding soils during the rare \nrains.  Fuel  will  be  stored  in  an  adequately  protected  area  to  prevent  contamination  of \ngroundwater  in  case  of  spills  or  leaks.  Construction  camps  shall  be  provided  with  septic \ntanks,  and  solid  waste  shall  be  properly  stored  and  disposed  of.  The  contractor  shall \nundertake proper decommissioning of work areas, work camp sites including waste dumps, \nand sealing/securing of wells newly dug for use during the construction period. Construction \ninspection will include specific examination of existing culverts and water channels in areas \nsubject to flash flooding to reconfirm that no drainage restrictions will result because of the \nconstruction  work.  The  contractor  shall  prepare  a  traffic  management  plan  to  ensure  that \nadequate vehicular and pedestrian access is provided at all times. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n \n\n63\n\n13.   Given  the  scarcity  of  water  (particularly  water  suitable  for  use  in  concrete  making) \nand a plan for contractors to extract large volumes from the deep aquifer along the road or \nfrom existing wells, a water extraction permitting and monitoring program will be prepared by \nthe contractors in close consultation with local water management authorities. The extraction \nvolumes per well will be established based on the geo-hydrological conditions as determined \nby  experts,  such  that  recharge  and  extraction  will  be  balanced.  Each  well  to  be  used  will \nhave a  maximum  sustainable  extraction  volume  established,  and  a meter  will  be  affixed  to \neach  well  with  a  seal.  Meters  will  be  read  daily,  with  records  sent  to  local  authorities. \nContractors  exceeding  allowable  limits  will  have  the  water  supply  shut  off  and  an \ninvestigation completed and fines paid.   \n \nThe  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  with  the  assistance  of  the  construction \n14.  \nsupervision  engineer,  shall  undertake  regular  environmental  compliance  monitoring.  A \nmonitoring  checklist  will  be  prepared  as  part  of  each  monitoring  cycle  and  a  monitoring \nreport,  which  will  be  attached  to  the  weekly  and  monthly  progress  reports.  The  monitoring \nreport will provide an assessment of the contractor\u2019s implementation of mitigation measures, \nidentification of other impacts that need to be addressed, and documentation of complaints \nby  the  affected  people  and  how  such  complaints  were  addressed.  To  carry  mitigation \nmeasures  over  into  the  operating  period,  the  contractor  will  prepare  a  construction  period \nenvironmental  mitigation  completion  report  to  be  submitted  to  Uzavtoyul  for  its  use  during \nthe operational period. Some measures, such as revegetation, will need to be continued and \nstrengthened during the operational period.   \n \n15.   Operation  Phase.  With  an  expected  small  increase  in  traffic  volume,  associated \nimpacts  will  likely  be  minor.  Local  air  and  noise  conditions  will  be  affected  minimally. \nUzavtoyul  shall  continue  maintaining  revegetation  areas  and  confirmation  of  the  predicted \nnoise  and  vibration  disturbance  caused  by  traffic  increase  if  there  is  roadside  residential \ndevelopment.  Depending  on  the  shipping  routes,  the  transport  of  larger  volumes  of \nhazardous and toxic materials may marginally increase the risk of hazardous material spills. \nOnce  the  traffic  volume  of  trucks  doubles  and  the  movement  of  hazardous  and  toxic \nmaterials  increases  significantly,  a  specific  spill  contingency  plan  should  be  prepared  and \nprovincial offices should be trained to respond to spills.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  proposed  in  the  IEE  shall  be  made \n16.  \nlegally binding through inclusion as environmental clauses in the Loan Agreement between \nthe Government and ADB as well as in the specifications in the contract bid documents. The \ncontractor shall be responsible in implementing the identified mitigation measures during the \nconstruction  stage  and  shall  be  required  to  prepare  a  site-specific  construction  period \nenvironmental  action  plan  defining  steps  they  will  take  to  ensure  timely  and  proper \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  using,  as  basis,  the  environmental  controls \nrecommended in the IEE. The Project will have a PIU assisted by a construction supervision \nengineer,  likely  an  international  consultant,  with  responsibility  for  environmental  mitigation \nand  monitoring  oversight.  It  will  be  the  construction  supervision  engineer\u2019s  responsibility  to \nestablish  specific  pay  items  for  the  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  activities,  with \npayments  made  only  after  verification  that  each  work  component  has  been  completed  as \nprescribed.  Since  neither  Uzavtoyul  nor  the  Road  Fund  have  skills  in  environmental \ncompliance inspection/monitoring and reporting, particularly at the oblast or provincial level, \nthe  PIU  will  organize  and  coordinate  workshops  for  managers  and  oblast-level  inspectors. \nTopics  will  include  environmental  assessment,  mitigation  inspection,  enforcement  of \nenvironmental  management  plans,  and  reporting.  Terms  of  reference  for  a  short  training \nprogram have been prepared and are attached in the IEE. \n \n17.  \ncommitment \n\nDuring  the  project  design  period,  monitoring  will  focus  on  confirming  Uzavtoyul\u2019s \ntraining  programs  on  environmental \nin \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nto  arranging  and  participating \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nTwo  public  consultation  sessions,  attended  by \n\nassessment,  mitigation  and  monitoring  methods,  and  reporting.  Secondly,  the  contract \ndocumentation will be examined to assure that appropriate environmental safeguards have \nbeen  added,  such  as  the  requirement  to  implement  and  adhere  to  the  environmental \nmitigation and monitoring plan. \n \nConstruction  period  monitoring  will  deal  mostly  with  compliance  monitoring  of  the \n18.  \nfollowing  construction-related  actions:  (i)  consultation  with  local  community  people  prior  to \ninitiation of work that affects their livelihoods, e.g., access restriction and traffic congestion, \nnoise; (ii) execution and management of the revegetation program; (iii) handling and delivery \nof construction materials; (iv) dust management at construction sites; and (v) general good \nhousekeeping activities by the contractor at all construction sites. \n \nF. \n \nlocal  officials  and  small \n19.  \nbusinesspersons,  were  undertaken  for  the  Project.  During  these  consultations,  all  project \ndetails known at the time, except costs, were disclosed, including the preparation of an EMP \nand the strong commitments of Uzavtoyul to follow the environmental guidelines defined in \nthe  IEE.  During  both  sets  of  meetings,  participants  were  pleased  to  note  the  emphasis  on \nenvironmental  controls  but  felt  that  there  was  little  to  be  concerned  about  for  this  Project. \nThe  first  consultation  was  in  June  2007,  held  in  Bukhara  and  Urgenh.  The  TA  consultants \npresented  the  Project  and  sought  comments  and  inputs.  The  participants  did  not  raise \nconcerns  regarding  potential  environmental  impacts  and  expressed  full  support  for  the \nProject. The second round of consultations was held in Nukus and Kungrad, Karakalpakstan \nin  July  2007,  and  addressed  specific  environmental  concerns  such  as  the  existence  and \nsensitivity of the endangered species near the project area, and existing concerns with noise \nand air pollution. Local officials and municipal managers had no concerns with construction \nperiod  impacts,  but  were  interested  to  learn  about  the  traffic  management  program  during \nthe  construction,  as  the  work  would  be  done  on  the  existing  A-380  highway.  Uzavtoyul  is \nconsulting with its regional offices in this matter and will require that the contractors prepare \na traffic management program.   \n \nG. \n \nThe project road, along with other proposed improvements along various sections of \n20.  \nthe  A-380  highway,  will  contribute  to  reduced  travel  time,  more  reliable  transport  service, \ngreater  passenger  comfort,  and  generation  of  jobs  stemming  from  greater  traffic-induced \ncommerce. These changes will, over the long term, gradually lead to an improved standard \nof living for local families who take advantage of new income-generating opportunities. It will \nprovide  better  access  to  services  such  as  health,  schooling,  and  markets  that  will  be  felt \nimmediately once a section or road is improved. \n \n21.   While  the  IEE  identified  a  number  endangered  species,  these  are  found  at  great \ndistance  from  section  2  on  the  Ustyurt  Plateau.  Local  experts  indicated  that  few,  if  any,  of \nthese species are found anywhere near the road right-of-way.  \n \nProvided  that  the  mitigation  and  monitoring  actions  defined  in  the  IEE  are \n22.  \nimplemented  during  the  construction  and  operation  periods,  the  Project  will  not  have \nsignificant adverse environmental effects and should be carried out as planned. \n \nH. \n \nThe  IEE  is  considered  sufficient  to  identify  anticipated  impacts  associated  with  the \n23.  \nProject, and provides measures for their mitigation and management. Therefore, no further \nenvironmental assessment is required.  \n \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 27 November 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\nSUM1.00\n$1.00\n", "sum (SUM) \n$0.000778 \nSUM1,285.23 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs Conseils  \n(International Federation of Consulting Engineers) \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nHighway Development and Management Model 4 \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \ninternational roughness index \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "national competitive bidding \nnet present value \noperation and maintenance \nordinary capital resources \nproject implementation unit \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nroad equipment pool company \nright-of-way \nsummary initial environmental examination \nstate joint stock company \nstatement of expenditures \ntechnical assistance \nTransports Internationaux Routiers  \nvehicle operating cost \nvehicles per day \n", "NOTES \n", "ADB \nCAREC \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIDIC \n", "FIRR \nGDP \nHDM-4 \nICB \nIEE \nIRI \nLIBOR \nMOF \nNCB \nNPV \nO&M \nOCR \nPIU \nPPTA \nREPC \nROW \nSIEE \nSJSC \nSOE \nTA \nTIR \nVOC \nvpd \n", "(i) \n", " \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.
