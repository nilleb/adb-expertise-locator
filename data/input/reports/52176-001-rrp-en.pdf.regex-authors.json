THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Yangon City Water Resilience Project. \n \n2.  The project will address critical water infrastructure needs associated with bulk water \nsupply in Yangon City given the significant underinvestment for decades. It will support the \ngovernment\u2019s strategies to make its cities more livable by providing better and more widespread \nwater services and reinforcing water security. The project will (i) construct new water transmission \ninfrastructure  from  the  existing  Ngamoeyeik  reservoir  to  the  existing  Nyaungnhapin  water \ntreatment plant (WTP), including an intake structure, a pumping station, and a bulk water \nconveyance pipeline of about 34 kilometers (km) in length, to transfer about 818 million liters per \nday (MLD) of bulk water; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity of the Yangon City Development \nCommittee (YCDC) to operate and manage water services to reinforce the city\u2019s water supply. \nThe project will directly benefit about 800,000 people. While the project was envisioned well \nbefore the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it will make significant contributions to the \npandemic response by improving overall health and hygiene of the population of Yangon City.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Myanmar is the largest country in mainland Southeast Asia \nwith an area of 676,577 square kilometers (km2)1 and a population of 54.05 million.2 It comprises \n15 states and regions with a total of 330 townships. About 30% of the population live in urban \nareas and the rest live in rural areas. In 2019, agriculture accounted for 21.3% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) value added, industry contributed 38.0%, and services 40.7%.3 Urban areas \ngenerate a disproportionate share of the value added, but there is a massive investment gap in \nthe development of water and other urban infrastructure (footnote 1). \n \n4.  Yangon Region comprises 45 townships with a population of about 7.36 million and an \narea of 10,170 km2. Yangon City, the principal economic hub of Myanmar and the capital of \nYangon Region is made up of 33 townships and contains a population of about 5.20 million spread \nover an area of 895 km2. Yangon City\u2019s municipal services are managed by the YCDC.4 \n \n5.  As the country\u2019s largest city, Yangon represents about 10% of the national population and \n35% of the country\u2019s urban population, with contribution to Myanmar\u2019s GDP at about 23%.5 \nYangon City\u2019s population grew at 2.20% annually between 2014 and 2019, more than three times \nfaster than  the  country\u2019s  total  annual  population  growth  of  0.67%  during  the  same  period \n(footnote 2). There is also a transitory population of about 400,000 living in and around the city\u2019s \nindustrial areas.6 \n \n6.  Sources of bulk water. The YCDC supplies about 932 MLD of water to its customers, \n90% of which is drawn from surface water sources. About 614 MLD of the total supply is from the \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

Quarterly Financial Statistics Bulletin 2019, Volume II. Nay Pyi Taw. \n4  The YCDC is a public entity in Yangon City, established in 1985 and operating in accordance with the Yangon City \nMunicipal Law. Yangon Region Parliament. 2018. Yangon City Municipal Law. The YCDC\u2019s mandate includes \nprovision of certain public services, licensing, and collection of property and other taxes.  \n5  S. Fox and E. Verrucci. 2017.

Copenhagen. \n ", "2 \nNgamoeyeik reservoir, supplied through the Ngamoeyeik canal to the Nyaungnhapin WTP.7 In \nall, the Ngamoeyeik reservoir supplies 1,304 MLD for irrigation purposes and 614 MLD for \ndrinking water purposes, representing a combined flow of 1,918 MLD after accounting for \nevaporation and seepage losses in the open and unlined canal. \n \n7.  Water supply and scarcity. The YCDC serves all 33 townships of Yangon City, but in \npractice, each township\u2019s water supply is highly variable. With losses reported to be at least 60% \nof the total supply\u2014among the highest in Southeast Asia, less than half of the city\u2019s population \nreceive water through the YCDC\u2019s piped system.8 Those who receive service from the YCDC can \nonly expect an average water supply of 8 hours per day and experience frequent water supply \ninterruptions, with water pressure often only adequate late at night. Those without any service \nrely on private wells and/or water vendors, which cause added cost and inconvenience. However, \nthe heaviest burden is felt by the poor and vulnerable people and by women since inadequate \nprovision of potable water is common in areas where the poor live and they are obliged to spend \ntime to secure water for their basic needs.  \n \n8.  Water quality. Aggravating the supply constraints, water supplied by the YCDC is not \nsuitable for drinking. About a third of the total YCDC piped water supply receives no treatment at \nall, among the highest in Southeast Asia. The remaining supply is not properly treated at all times. \nTreated and untreated supplies are blended in the distribution network, which further reduces \nwater quality to levels that pose a risk to human health.9 A very high percentage of water samples \nin Yangon City is found to be contaminated with thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms, with a potential \nto cause E. coli. Myanmar\u2019s poor health outcomes also highlight the urgency of improving urban \ninfrastructure, including for water supply. Between 2015 and 2020, Myanmar\u2019s mortality rate of \nchildren under 5 years of age was second highest in Southeast Asia, and the incidence of water \nborne diseases is quite high.10 \n \n9.  Water scarcity and impacts on personal hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nYangon City is subject to periods of water scarcity during the dry season. Given the strong water-\nsanitation-hygiene linkage, any water shortage or deterioration in water quality will adversely \nimpact personal hygiene of Yangon City\u2019s communities, which could hamper efforts to battle the \nongoing COVID-19 pandemic. YCDC\u2019s plan to enhance water security and water quality for \nYangon City is a practical response aligned with measures to arrest devastating health, social, \nand economic impacts of diseases including COVID-19.  \n \n \n7  The Nyaungnhapin WTP is Yangon City\u2019s only large-scale conventional WTP, while the other YCDC facilities are \nsmall-scale plants and stations. To address capacity and operational constraints of the existing Nyaungnhapin WTP, \nthe YCDC propose to refurbish and augment the WTP. This and other future projects by the YCDC will expand water \ndistribution coverage across Yangon City and will be supported by development partners. \n8  Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Immigration and Population. 2015. The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing \nCensus. Nay Pyi Taw. The 2014 Census showed that the water supply service coverage rate for Yangon City was \n35%. The YCDC has indicated that this level has increased to 40%\u201350% by early 2020, but datasets are not yet \navailable to substantiate this update. \n9  According to the Myanmar Living Conditions Survey, 2017 of the United Nations Development Programme, almost \n50% of Yangon City\u2019s population relied on bottled water for their drinking water needs.  \n10 Statista.  2020.  Infant  mortality  rates  Southeast  Asia  2015-2020  by  country. \nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/590013/. Only about 9% of the households in Yangon City have access to \nwastewater  management services.  About  43%  of households  have septic  tanks,  and  the others  discharge \nwastewater into local drains with no treatment, creating significant odor and public health issues. A wastewater \ntreatment plant with capacity of 15 MLD constructed in 2005 currently receives only about 2.3 MLD of wastewater \nfrom the existing network (constructed in the 1880s). Septage collection is inadequate, because of an insufficient \nnumber of vacuum collection trucks. To address this lack of service by Yangon Region Government (YRG) and the \nYCDC, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will finance the Yangon Sewerage System Development \nProject. The JICA loan was signed in January 2020. \n ", "3 \n10.  Groundwater overreliance. By 2017, Yangon City had significant industrial activities, \nwhich placed further strain on the available water supply from the YCDC. As the YCDC is unable \nto fully serve industrial water customers, many factories use their own groundwater supply, which \ndepletes groundwater resources, causing subsidence.11 In areas where the YCDC\u2019s water service \nis inadequate or absent, household consumers also rely on groundwater from aquifers. \n \n11.  Impacts of groundwater depletion. Yangon City is situated on a delta, where the \nexhaustion of groundwater is compounded by sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion in tube wells in \nareas close to rivers and the sea is widespread, while the city\u2019s geology, primarily meadow \nalluvium, is susceptible to sinking.12 This increases the risk of subsidence in some densely \npopulated areas and inevitably exposes the urban poor, who live in dilapidated housing on \nmarginal, flood-prone land, to the greatest risk. Yangon City\u2019s dependence on groundwater must \nbe significantly reduced to avoid outright loss of dwindling groundwater supplies. \n \n12.  Constraints in delivering bulk water to Yangon City. Bulk water from the Ngamoeyeik \nreservoir to Yangon City\u2019s Nyaungnhapin WTP is currently conveyed through the 36.3 km \nNgamoeyeik canal.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MOALI) owns the initial \n25.4 km of the canal and shares this section with the YCDC, and the YCDC owns the remaining \n10.9 km. MOALI provides water for irrigated agriculture for only 3 months of the year and performs \nmaintenance on the canal outside of this 3-month period. MOALI may also perform emergency \nmaintenance and repair works on the canal. Furthermore, as an open structure, the canal requires \nfrequent maintenance which can be accommodated only during extended periods with no water \nservice delivery. However, as the YCDC requires water 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, all year \nround,  MOALI  cannot  suspend  delivery  of  water  to  the  YCDC.  As  a  result,  necessary \nrefurbishments and repairs are deferred, or attempts are made to make repairs while the canal is \nin operation. The YCDC\u2019s dependency on MOALI for water transmission, while unavoidable in \nthe short-term due to the lack of any alternatives, prevents it from developing a sustainable, long-\nterm solution for ensuring reliable water supply to Yangon City.  \n \n13.  Need for secure and safe water transfer. The potential for intermittent bulk water supply \ncombined with a lack of direct operational control of the overall length of the Ngamoeyeik canal \nby the YCDC presents an unacceptable risk to the water security of Yangon City. The substantial \nwater loss due to evaporation and seepage in the open and unlined canal, coupled with ongoing \nbank deterioration, causes significant reduction in system resilience. Water safety cannot be \nassured if the open canal is exposed to surface water runoff including from industry, which is \nexpanding to areas adjacent to the canal. Unsafe water transferred to the WTP will stress the \ntreatment system and require higher treatment costs to supply potable water to Yangon City. \n \n14.  Climate impacts. Projected climate change and temperature increases will lead to higher \nevaporation rates. More frequent and stronger cyclones and more intense precipitation will \nincrease surface water runoff, exacerbating efforts to control pollution in the canal.13 As the YCDC \nestimates the city\u2019s water demand to be about 2,519 MLD by 2040, up from approximately 932 \nMLD in 2020, the overall resilience and robustness of the bulk water system will become even \nmore critical.  \n \n15.  Institutional arrangements. The YCDC is responsible for the delivery of water services \nin Yangon City. Prior to 2018, the YCDC\u2019s Engineering Department (Water and Sanitation) \n(EDWS) undertook both the water supply and sanitation functions. Under the Yangon City \nMunicipal Law enacted in June 2018, the newly created Water Resources and Water Supply \n \n11 Government of the Netherlands. 2016. Industrial and Urban Water in Myanmar.

Urban Infrastructure Improvement in Yangon City: Scoping Study. Manila. \n ", "4 \nAuthority (WRWSA) has been designated to be responsible for the YCDC\u2019s water supply and \nresources.14 The transfer of water supply functions from the EDWS to the WRWSA has been \ncompleted.  However,  YCDC\u2019s  capacity  needs  to  be  enhanced  because  the  water  sector \nchallenges facing Yangon City require the YCDC to manage water resources and services as \nefficiently and prudently as possible. Building the capacity of the WRWSA and managing new \ninstitutional arrangements is an ongoing process and is a precondition for the delivery of improved \nand expanded water services. \n \n16.  Financial sustainability. The YCDC\u2019s revenue comprises tax (31%), tariff (8%), and \nother income sources (61%) such as permits and licenses, and land and building rental. The \nYCDC receives no intergovernmental transfers, except a subsidy for capital investment. During \nFY2015-FY2019, the YCDC maintained an operating ratio of 0.5\u20130.6. However, forecasts show \nthat the operating ratio will cross 1.0 by 2030 because the growth rate of operating expenses will \nexceed that of revenue by a considerable margin. Hence, it is critical to reinforce the revenue \nstream  with  efforts  by  both  the  YRG  and  the  YCDC  to  undertake  institutional  reforms \naccompanied by a well-regulated tariff system and prudent financial management practices. \n \n17.  Sector strategy. With support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \nthe  Yangon  Region  Government  (YRG)  and  the  YCDC  developed  the  Strategic  Urban \nDevelopment Plan (SUDP) of Greater Yangon, which was approved by the Parliament of Yangon \nRegion in June 2015 and updated in 2018.15 The SUDP is the vision of the future structure of \nYangon Region, including for Yangon City, and for other urban sub centers, greenbelts, and new \ntowns. Building on this vision, the YCDC plans to expand reliable and safe water service to 86% \nof the Yangon City residents by 2040.16 \n \n18.  As identified in the SUDP, the YCDC proposes to (i) develop water resources and water \ntreatment capacity; (ii) establish effective transmission and distribution systems; (iii) improve \nwater quality; (iv) reduce water losses; (v) improve billing and collection; and (vi) improve \ninstitutional and organizational capacity, and enhance human resources. Based on the SUDP, \nthe YCDC has commenced a series of projects, including the Yangon Water Supply Improvement \nProject in 2015 with a phase I loan of $222 million from JICA. This will be followed by additional \nsupport from JICA and other development partners. The phased projects identified by the SUDP \nwill bring additional supply, transfer, treatment, and distribution capacity to help meet Yangon \nCity\u2019s ambitious targets for water service coverage by 2040. \n \n19.  The  project  will  enhance  Yangon  City\u2019s  water  security,  achieving  benefits  for  all \nresidents.17 This was a fundamental requirement before the emergence of COVID-19. The \nproposed project now has far greater urgency and importance as an essential part of the response \nto the COVID-19 pandemic and other future health emergencies. Access to safe and reliable \ndrinking  water  complements  access  to  adequate  sanitation  and  good  hygiene  practices. \nCombining water supply, sanitation, and hygiene is a fundamental building block in delivering \nimproved health outcomes, especially for the poor and vulnerable, and leads to wider socio-\neconomic benefits in addition to its impact on public health. The country requires significant \n \n14 Under the YCDC, the WRWSA is responsible for finding new water resources; installing and maintaining bulk water \ntransmission pipelines, distribution lines, and pumping stations; giving permission for new connections; prohibiting \nunsanitary supplies from public or private suppliers; managing the water standards periodically specified by the World \nHealth Organization and relevant ministries; and leasing land required for water supply.

Other strategic alignments. The government has placed a high-level focus on the \ndevelopment of sustainable cities to achieve its overarching goal of inclusive and sustainable \neconomic development.19 Equitable access to water and sanitation is a key component of the \nMyanmar Sustainable Development Plan, which also includes the development of additional \nwater resources, enhanced management of water supply, and improved sanitation.20 The project \nsupports government initiatives to make its infrastructure climate resilient and energy efficient.21 \nThe project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u20132021 and \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 that identify urban development as a priority area, \nwith support for climate change responses and enhanced institutional capacity.22 \n \n22.  Development  coordination.  The  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  is \npreparing the feasibility study for the Hlawga Water Supply Project, which will include a new 205 \nMLD  WTP.  The  raw  water  for  this  AFD  project  may  be  supplied  via  the  new  bulk  water \ntransmission system to be constructed under the project. The 818 MLD of water envisaged to be \ntransferred under the project will supply 409 MLD to the existing Nyaungnhapin WTP. The YCDC \nis considering options to fully utilize the augmented water supply, including routing 205 MLD of \nthe remaining 409 MLD to the Hlawga WTP under the AFD project and allocating the balance of \n204 MLD to a future expansion of the Nyaungnhapin WTP. The project will also continue to build \nlinks with ongoing JICA-supported water supply and wastewater management improvement \nprojects and programs which support capacity development in urban management and water \n \n18 ADB. 2018.

There is no active conflict in Yangon City or the project area. \nHowever, the project is designed with an understanding of the country context. The project will \nbenefit all communities in the townships where the YCDC provides piped water supply, in an \ninclusive and fair manner through access to secure water services. The project will minimize risks \nassociated  with  conflict  through  meaningful  stakeholder  participation,  including  civil  society \nengagement and an effective communication strategy. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n24.  Impact and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impact: Yangon City\u2019s \nurban resilience and livability enhanced.24 The project will have the following outcome: security of \nYangon City\u2019s water supply reinforced.25 \n \n25.  Output 1: Bulk water transmission system constructed. The project will finance the \nconstruction of new facilities to transfer about 818 MLD of water to Yangon City, including (i) an \nintake structure at the Ngamoeyeik reservoir, (ii) an online pumping station 900 meters (m) \ndownstream of the intake structure, and (iii) a 34 km pipeline of 2.4 m diameter from Ngamoeyeik \nreservoir to the Nyaungnhapin WTP.26  These interventions will secure and expand the existing \nwater services and will complement the YCDC\u2019s strategic plan by increasing the supply of raw \nwater from the Ngamoeyeik reservoir to the Nyaungnhapin WTP by one third from 614 MLD to \n818 MLD. \n \n26.  Output 2: Institutional sustainability strengthened. The project will strengthen the \nYCDC\u2019s institutional sustainability to increase the reliability of its water services and by supporting \nits subsidiary water authority, the WRWSA. It will support capacity building of the YCDC in critical \nareas, such as water systems operational management and climate change responsiveness. The \nproject will prepare a wide-ranging financial sustainability road map for the YCDC, including \noptions for a new water tariff strategy. The project will also provide targeted support to build the \nYCDC\u2019s self-financing capacity to meet the growing demands on its water service. The project \nwill support the YCDC in optimizing its operating efficiency by expanding its metered water service \nand improving its collection efficiency and customer service. \n \n27.  Key lessons. The project preparation built on lessons from recent project design and \nimplementation experience.27 The key lessons incorporated in the project include (i) upfront \n \n23 In 2015, the YCDC commenced the JICA-financed Yangon Water Supply Improvement Project (phase I). Under the \nfollow-on phase II (commenced in 2017), the first tranche of $232 million will help expand the YCDC\u2019s water treatment \ncapacity and improve its distribution networks. The second tranche of the phase II loan will be disbursed from 2020 \nand the third tranche from 2023, for a total of $398 million. \n24 Government of Myanmar. 2016.

Value Added by ADB \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s ongoing operations (footnote 27) have been supporting the rehabilitation and \ndevelopment  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services  including  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, solid waste management, tertiary roads, and urban planning and management \ncapacity strengthening in major cities and secondary cities and towns. The project will directly \ncomplement  the  YCDC\u2019s  SUDP  master  plan  for  the  Yangon  Region  (vision  for  2040)  by \nreinforcing bulk water supply to Yangon City (paras. 17\u201318). The project supports the ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u20132021, to improve access to basic infrastructure \nand services, accelerate structural and institutional reforms in key sectors and provide tailor-\nmade, innovative knowledge and technology solutions (para. 21). The project is also aligned with \nthe YCDC\u2019s phased approach in the water sector through various development partner-funded \nprojects including by AFD, JICA and World Bank (para. 22). The project will also help Myanmar \nmeet the relevant Sustainable Development Goals. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s comparative advantage in driving sector reform will be central in the support offered \nby the project as the YCDC seeks to build capacity in the WRWSA. ADB will provide the YCDC \nwith targeted support in long-term planning and strengthening of the WRWSA. ADB will assist the \nYCDC by closing the large financing gap, which is a prerequisite for ensuring the city\u2019s long-term \nwater security. Adoption of information and communication technologies and other remote digital \nsystems will deliver benefits in control and systems management. In addition, the project will bring \ninternational best practice on efficient operational management of a large-scale bulk water \nscheme using the emerging principles of smart water and big (cloud) data. Through the project, \nADB will support transfer of best practices in water operations to other cities in Myanmar and \nspecifically under ADB\u2019s ongoing operations (footnote 27). \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n30.  The project is estimated to cost $196 million (Table 2).

The government has requested a concessional loan of $180 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The borrower \nwill be the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, which will relend the loan proceeds to the YCDC. \nRelending will carry the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The YCDC will bear the \nforeign exchange and interest rate variation risks.  \n \n32.  The summary financing plan is in Table 3. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nworks, goods, and consulting services.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2020\u2013December 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2025 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2026 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Project coordination committee \nChair: Mayor of Yangon Citya  \nMembers: Representatives from Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and \nIrrigation; Ministry of Construction; Ministry of Electricity and Energy; \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation; \nMinistry of Office of the Union Government; and Yangon Electricity \nSupply Corporation \n(ii) Executing agency  Yangon Region Government \n(iii) Key implementing agency  YCDC \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit is established by YCDC \nProcurement  Open competitive  1 contract  $144.03 million \nbidding (internationally  Bulk water supply \nadvertised) \n \n29 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nAspects  Arrangements \nOpen competitive  1 contract  $0.50 million \nbidding (nationally  Firefighting equipment and \nadvertised)   materials \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 1 contract   $9.25 million \nbased selection  200 person-months \n(international) \n825 person-months \n(national) \nAdvance contracting  Expressions of interest for project management consultant recruitment \nwill be invited after the approval of the project by the Union Parliament \nof Myanmar. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, YCDC = Yangon City Development Committee. \na  The mayor of Yangon City is also the chair of the YCDC and the development affairs minister of the Yangon Region \nGovernment\u2019s cabinet, facilitating a robust cross-agency linkage for decision-making and effective implementation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n35.  Transmission pipeline alignment. Several routes for the pipeline from the reservoir to \nthe WTP were investigated, including a canal route, a road route, a mixed road\u2013canal route, and \na cross-country route. Based on a comparative assessment, the road route was preferred \nbecause of its reliance on an established right-of-way (ROW); ease of construction, access, and \noperation and maintenance (O&M); lower safeguard impacts; and cost efficiency. The initial part \nof the ROW is in favor of the YCDC, and the remaining section is vested in the Ministry of \nConstruction.30  \n \n36.  Construction considerations. To minimize the width and depth of the trench, moderate \nthe social and environmental impacts, and reduce the initial investment costs, an intermediate \npumping station is proposed. The adoption of the pumping station will reduce the pipeline\u2019s \ninternal diameter by 0.5 m, from about 2.9 m to 2.4 m, and decrease the necessary excavation \ndepth by about 1.5 m.  \n \n37.  Safe working under COVID-19 conditions. The impact of the COVID-19 disease is \nevolving. The implementation of the project will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging \nneeds and new best practice in construction and water utility management. The YCDC, the project \nmanagement consultant, and the contractor will incorporate emerging international construction \nbest practice on implementation methodologies for managing COVID-19 risk, vital for work in \ndeep trench and other confined spaces where the risk of transmission is high. Such practices will \nalso consider the government\u2019s guidance on safe working in COVID-19 conditions. \n \n38.  Operation and maintenance. The project\u2019s bulk water transmission system will be \noperated using a combination of gravity and pumping mains. Treatment of the water will be \nundertaken downstream of the system by the YCDC. On completion of the project, the YCDC will \nbe responsible for O&M. Support will be provided to the YCDC during implementation of the \nproject to develop operational guidelines to manage the system including the need for planned \n \n30 The YCDC has obtained permission from the Ministry of Construction to construct, operate, and maintain the project\u2019s \nfacilities within the Ministry of Construction\u2019s ROW. \n ", "10 \nphysical inspections and/or related work. In accordance with water industry good practice, the \ndesign of the project will limit the need for physical inspections by the YCDC during O&M. The \nlessons learned from the project under COVID-19 conditions will be collated in an O&M manual \nto document best practices and synthesize approaches for O&M for future health emergencies.  \n \n39.  Climate change considerations. The water balance study conducted with support from \nthe Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund confirmed that, under climate change conditions \nand continued urban growth, no water shortage is anticipated at the Ngamoeyeik reservoir \nbecause of the project. The project\u2019s water demand from the reservoir will have no adverse impact \non MOALI operations.31 The pumping station has been designed with high-efficiency pumps, \nwhich will minimize power consumption. The project design will protect project-related key \nequipment and structures which may be vulnerable to potential damage from erosion and/or \nflooding. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n40.  Economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic viability of the project. The \nresults of the economic cost\u2013benefit analysis show that the project is economically viable. The \neconomic net present value is MK19.2 billion ($12.7 million) based on a discount rate of 9%, and \nthe economic internal rate of return is 10%, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of 9%. \nThe project\u2019s economic viability would increase if unquantifiable economic benefits from better \nhealth of the population and improved environmental conditions are considered. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n41.  The project is nonrevenue-generating and the financial analysis indicated that the project \nis unlikely to be financially viable in the medium- to long-term under the current revenue stream. \nTo ensure financial sustainability, the project will support an operation efficiency optimization \nprogram that includes expanding the metered water service, enhancing collection efficiency, and \nimproving customer service. The YRG has obliged the YCDC to explore all practical means to put \nitself on a path to financial sustainability using its powers to raise tariffs under the Yangon City \nMunicipal Law. Hence, the YCDC will engage in a phased, economically and socially acceptable \ntariff reform program, coupled with a long-term plan for service coverage expansion. A financial \nsustainability road map to be developed under the project will contain a new water tariff structure \ninformed by socioeconomic survey outcomes and JICA\u2019s support to the YCDC on financial \nmanagement. The YRG will guarantee budget transfers to the YCDC to cover any project related \nO&M shortfall.32 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n42.  Financial management assessment. The pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nconsidered substantial because of the weak capacity of the YCDC\u2019s staff to manage ADB funds, \ndeficiencies in the coverage and timeliness of external project audit, structural weakness of \ninternal audit system, suboptimal record-keeping, and inconsistencies because of a lack of a \nrobust financial management information system. The project includes the following risk mitigation \nmeasures: (i) provision of focused and demand-driven training on ADB financial management \nrequirements  and  loan  disbursement  procedures,  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  endorsement  of  the  terms  of \n \n31 Financed by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered by ADB. \n32 Yangon Region Parliament. 2018. Yangon City Municipal Law. The Yangon City Municipal Law establishes the \ninstitutional relationship between the YCDC and the YRG and stipulates that the YCDC operates under the Yangon \nRegion\u2019s Budget Law, which is administered by the YRG. \n ", "11 \nreference for the external auditor to ensure the quality of external audit of project financial \nstatements, (iii) provision of a capacity-building program to strengthen the internal audit capacity, \nand (iv) adoption of a robust financial management information system. \n \n43.  The YCDC operates under Yangon Region\u2019s Budget Law, but raises its own revenues by \ncollecting fees, tariffs, and taxes in accordance with the Yangon City Municipal Law. At the end \nof each fiscal year, the YCDC is required to prepare annual financial statements in accordance \nwith the Myanmar Accounting Standards, which are audited by the Yangon Region auditor \ngeneral in accordance with the Yangon City Municipal Law and submitted to the YRG for \nconfirmation of its funds and operations by the YRG. The project will ensure that the YCDC and/or \nthe YRG make sufficient funds available for long-term O&M of the facilities constructed under the \nproject. \n \n44.  Procurement capacity assessments. The procurement risk is rated high. The strategic \nprocurement planning assessed procurement risks and identified optimal procurement packages \nto mitigate such risks given the capacity constraints within the YCDC. Procurement is streamlined \nunder  two  main  packages\u2014a  consulting  contract  for  preparation  of  detailed  design  and \nconstruction supervision and a large civil works contract that includes capacity building of the \nYCDC in O&M of the facility after completion. The single-responsibility civil works contract will \nhelp deliver value for money as it minimizes interfaces and organizational complexity, allowing for \nmore efficient delivery. The appointment of one contractor responsible for procurement of the \npipeline will further drive value for money by bringing economies of scale in the manufacturing of \nthe pipes. \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  YRG,  and  the  YCDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social and Gender \n \n46.  Poverty targeting. The project is classified as a general intervention for poverty targeting \nbecause it will construct a bulk water transmission system to improve urban resilience. Improved \nservices will contribute to making the city more productive and increasing economic opportunities \nfor people, leading to poverty reduction. The project will directly benefit 800,000 people in the \nYCDC service area. The project\u2019s civil works contract will give people in the project area an \nopportunity to work as part of the labor force, particularly in the numerous unskilled jobs. \n \n47.  Gender features. The project is categorized no gender elements. Due to the nature of the \nproject, which focuses on bulk water supply infrastructure, it is unlikely to directly improve \nwomen\u2019s access to services and opportunities. However, through the project, the YCDC will \nensure that its consultations, communications, and customer satisfaction surveys are gender-\nsensitive. The YCDC will also enhance the skills of female staff by ensuring high levels of \nrepresentation in project management, procurement, and financial management activities, and in \ncapacity  building  on  improving  water  management,  climate  change  responsiveness,  and \noperation of the project facilities. The project will not disadvantage women in any way and the \noutcome of the project is fully inclusive and everyone in society will benefit equally. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n48.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n ", "12 \n49.  Environment (category B). The project has been classified as category B, requiring an \ninitial environmental examination (IEE).33 The IEE report has been prepared in accordance with \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the Myanmar Environmental Impact \nAssessment Procedure (2015). The IEE concluded that the project will have positive benefits \nthrough  improvements  in  water  security  and  in  water  quality  at  the  Nyaungnhapin  WTP. \nAnticipated adverse impacts during construction are temporary and localized and will be mitigated \nand monitored through measures defined in the environmental management plan (EMP).34 The \nYCDC, through its project management unit, will be responsible for implementing and monitoring \nthe  EMP,  and  has  committed  to  provide  adequate  environmental  management  capacity. \nAssuming that measures in the EMP are effectively implemented, the project is not expected to \nhave a significant adverse environmental impact. \n \n50.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will not involve acquisition of any \nprivately owned lands, as the pipeline will be constructed using the existing ROW held by the \nMinistry of Construction and the YCDC. During project preparation, various encroachments were \nidentified along the ROW. Some of these structures will be affected entirely and some will be \nimpacted partially. The total number of project-affected households is 226 with 918 affected \npersons. Of these affected households, 142 are considered vulnerable, and 99 of these 142 are \nconsidered severely affected. All 142 affected households are eligible for additional financial \nassistance, will be supported under a livelihood and income restoration program, and will be given \npreference for project-related employment during construction. \n \n51.  Resettlement plan. The draft resettlement plan has been developed in accordance with \nnational  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  It  includes  provision  for \ncompensation for all assets at replacement value, additional assistance, and resettlement and \nrehabilitation measures for affected persons, including vulnerable households and those without \nlegal title to the land.35 The project will assist in relocating the permanently affected households \nalong the same ROW, where feasible, after due compensation.  \n \n52.  The draft resettlement plan was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 19 March 2020. The draft \nresettlement plan will be finalized, and the cost estimates will be updated, during detailed design. \nThe YCDC has limited experience and capacity to manage involuntary resettlement, and they will \nreceive training and other support.36 The YCDC will engage an external monitor to oversee the \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. A corrective action plan will be prepared to rectify any \nnoncompliance. \n \n53.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Ethnic groups represent only 2% of the surveyed \npopulation. The project will have no direct or indirect impacts on these ethnic households. These \nethnic households have migrated to Yangon City from other regions of Myanmar. Nonetheless, \nthe resettlement plan provides for additional assistance, so that any unforeseen impacts on ethnic \nhouseholds can be mitigated during detailed design. \n \n54.  Consultation,  communication,  and  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Meaningful \nconsultations  with  affected  persons  have  been  undertaken  by  the  YCDC  during  project \npreparation, and this will continue during project implementation with the participation of affected \n \n33 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 During construction, there will be localized temporary adverse impacts caused by excavation, tunneling, and pipe-\nlaying works, including ground surface disturbance, increased dust and noise levels, occupational and community \nhealth and safety risks, temporary traffic disturbance, and spoil disposal. \n35 An indicative budget provision of $1.25 million has been made for implementation of the resettlement plan. \n36 Training on ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement to build stakeholder capacity will be provided by the project \nmanagement consultant. \n ", "13 \npersons. A stakeholder analysis, participation plan, and communication strategy have been \nprepared  by  the  YCDC,  and  a  gender-inclusive  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been \ndeveloped to address concerns, complaints, and grievances during project implementation. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n55.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe YCDC and/or the YRG fail to secure  The assurances from the relevant authorities will be \ntimely and legally enforceable  formalized as loan covenants, and ADB will assist the \ncommitments from the relevant  YCDC to the extent practicable in negotiations with the \nauthorities for on-demand water  relevant authorities. \nallocation, provision of power supplies, \nand access to right-of-way. \nThe YCDC has no experience with ADB  The number of procurement packages will be minimized, \nprocurement procedures.  and an open competitive bidding process will be adopted. \nThe project management consultant will include \nprocurement specialists experienced in ADB\u2019s procurement \nprocedures.
