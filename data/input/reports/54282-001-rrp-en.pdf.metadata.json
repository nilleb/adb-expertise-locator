THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic  of Uzbekistan for the COVID-19  Emergency Response  Project. The report also \ndescribes the proposed partial administration of a loan to be provided by the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment  Bank  (AIIB)  for the  COVID-19  Emergency  Response  Project,  and if the  Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the AIIB loan.   \n \n2.  The proposed project is part of an integral package of support to help the immediate and \ntransition efforts of the Government of Uzbekistan to mitigate the significant health, social, and \neconomic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The project will help the \ngovernment to augment resilience to future public health emergencies, including a resurgence of \nCOVID-19, by improving testing, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19 cases.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  COVID-19  pandemic.  On  30  January  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) \ndeclared  the  COVID-19  outbreak  a  public  health  emergency  of  international  concern.  On \n11 March 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.1 By 7 July 2020, nearly \n11.5  million  people  had  been  diagnosed  with  COVID-19,  with  more  than  535,000  deaths, \nglobally.2 On 15 March 2020, the government announced the first confirmed COVID-19 case. \nOnly 10,587 COVID-19 cases and 39 deaths had been confirmed by 7 July 2020 because of strict \nlockdown measures.3 However, the number of confirmed cases is rising because of the relaxation \nof lockdown measures and the repatriation of thousands of Uzbek migrant workers, so Uzbekistan \nneeds to reinforce its resilience to COVID-19 and other public health emergencies.  \n \n4.  Socioeconomic  impact. Uzbekistan,  with a population of 34.1 million and estimated \ngross domestic product per capita of $1,742 (2019), is centrally located in Central Asia.4 It is \nparticularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown, as a regional trade and \ncommerce hub, with a large volume of international travelers and a large migrant population \nworking abroad, especially in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan will suffer a \nsignificant macroeconomic impact,5 as gross domestic product growth is expected to decline to \n1.5% in 2020 from a pre-COVID-19 estimate of 6.0% (footnote 4). Uzbekistan is vulnerable to \nexternal shocks, given its heavy reliance on remittances.   \n  \n5.  The pandemic has resulted in widespread job losses, particularly for migrant laborers and \nworkers in industry and services. Of the small businesses, 85% are estimated to have closed \ntemporarily. According to a World Bank study, in the absence of remittances, the poverty rate \nbased  on  the poverty  line  for lower  middle-income  countries  ($3.2  per person  per day)  in \n \n1  WHO.

Unpublished. \n ", "2 \nUzbekistan  would have increased  from 9.6% to 16.8%  in 2018.6 Estimates  indicate that the \npoverty rate based on the same poverty line for lower middle-income countries, would increase \nfrom a projection of 7.4% before the crisis, to 8.7%, following the outbreak\u2014equivalent  to an \nadditional 448,000 people falling into poverty in 2020.7 Household income, employment, and food \nsecurity are all expected to decline further unless the pandemic is contained, and the lockdown \nmeasures can be further eased.  \n \n6.  Government  response.  The  government  established  the  Special  Republican \nCommission  on 29  January  2020  to (i) monitor  the  epidemic  and  raise public  awareness, \n(ii) communicate  with  international  organizations  and  countries  experiencing  outbreaks,  and \n(iii) expand health care facilities and procure the necessary antiviral medicines and equipment.8 \nThe government released the National Health Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan on \n19 March 2020.9 The plan aims to (i) address the COVID-19 emergency by identifying, isolating, \nand providing care for patients with COVID-19 to minimize the disease spread, morbidity, and \nmortality; (ii) strengthen the short- and long-run capacity of the health system to provide intensive \ncare; (iii) implement  effective public awareness  campaigns  on how  to  tackle  the COVID-19 \nemergency;  (iv) expand  unemployment  benefits  to formal  sector workers;  (v) provide  wage \nsubsidies for companies for furloughed workers; and (vi) expand cash transfers to vulnerable \nhouseholds and individuals. The government established the SUM10.00 trillion Anti-crisis Fund \nand has undertaken health, economic stabilization, and social protection measures.10 Lockdown \nmeasures, including the closing of schools and businesses and a curfew in the most affected \nlocations, came into effect on 16 March 2020. The government requested emergency assistance \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to upgrade and expand the national laboratory and \nsurveillance system on 26 April 2020. ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy paper \n(2004) (Emergency  Policy)  requires  that an emergency assistance  loan be processed in an \nexpeditious manner (within 12 weeks). Counting from the time the government officially requested \nADB to provide the emergency assistance on 26 April 2020, the processing  of the proposed \nemergency assistance loan exceeds the 12-week period, as stipulated in the Emergency Policy, \nby eleven days. The reason for the short delay was due to the government and ADB exploring \ndifferent options for support and defining the scope for the proposed project. \n \n7.  Damage  and  needs  assessment.  The  rigorous  lockdown  measures,  including  the \nquarantine of all suspected cases and contacts, helped reduce the 5-day moving average of daily \nnew confirmed COVID-19 cases from more than 100 in mid-April to less than 50 by the end of \nApril 2020. With the gradual lifting of travel restrictions,11 it increased to 300 by the first week of \nJuly 2020.12 WHO estimates that the weekly number of confirmed cases could plateau at more \nthan 8,000  by January 2021.13 Health  workers, more than 80.0% of whom are women,  are \ndisproportionately affected (11.0% of total cases) while representing only 1.3% of the population. \n \n6  W.

Testing, contact tracing, risk stratification, surveillance and monitoring, and treatment of \nCOVID-19 patients are crucial in containing the spread of the disease.14 The Agency for Sanitary \nand Epidemiological Wellbeing (ASEW) is responsible for infectious disease control, and operates \na surveillance and response system, laboratories, and infectious disease hospitals. Most of the \nCOVID-19  polymerase  chain reaction  (PCR)  testing is conducted at ASEW laboratories and \nregional  AIDS  centers. The turnaround  time for testing results is 1 day. ASEW\u2019s laboratory \ncapacity needs to be expanded to be prepared for the COVID-19 surge and other public health \nemergencies. About 12,000 PCR tests can be performed daily by ASEW laboratories. Inadequate \nsupplies of test kits, reagents, and personal protective equipment (PPE) limit the full use of testing \ncapacity. Laboratory staff receive COVID-19  virtual training through the Tashkent Institute of \nPostgraduate  Medical  Education.  More  training  is  needed  on  topics  such as  (i)  laboratory \nbiosafety, (ii) use of equipment, and (iii) use of information and communication technology (ICT) \nsystems. Primary health care workers need further training in identifying potentially infected and \nhigh-risk individuals to improve contact tracing for screening, testing, isolation, and referral for the \ntreatment of cases. \n \n9.  An additional 30,800 beds are available for quarantine in Tashkent city and Tashkent \nregion. Fourteen regional hospitals and three republican (i.e., national) hospitals in Tashkent have \nbeen designated for treating COVID-19 cases. While more than 1,800 medical ventilators have \nbeen procured, this might not be sufficient in case of a surge of COVID-19 patients. The hospitals \nalso lack medical equipment to diagnose and treat comorbidities (simultaneous ailments) often \nseen in COVID-19 patients. These facilities need upgrading to provide safer working conditions \nand better personal protection to protect health workers. Targeted training on infection prevention \nand control and COVID-19 management is also needed. \n \n10.  The preoccupation with COVID-19  and the diversion of resources such as staff time, \nfacilities, equipment, and supplies, have affected the availability and quality of health services. It \nhas also affected demand for health services because of the lockdown, increased anxiety among \nthe population, and reduced household spending.15 Delays in the vaccination of children may give \nrise  to  outbreaks  of  other  communicable  diseases.  Disruption  to  the  treatment  of  chronic \nconditions  such as  HIV, AIDS, and tuberculosis  may  exacerbate  drug  resistance.  Women\u2019s \naccess  to safe  delivery  and other maternal  and  child health  services  may be  jeopardized. \nMaintaining COVID-19 response and essential health services in parallel is needed. \n \n11.  Emergency assistance coordination. A COVID-19 management team was established \non 12 March 2020 to plan and coordinate multilateral support for COVID-19 socioeconomic \nresponse and recovery.16 The proposed response totals $289 million, including an ADB\u2013AIIB \ncontribution of $200 million and a $38 million health component of the World Bank\u2019s $95 million \nloan that focuses on the immediate needs of COVID-19 treatment and testing. ADB also mobilized \n$19.5 million from the Primary  Health Care Improvement  Project.17 Other support is in kind, \nincluding technical assistance, training, equipment, and supplies.18 ADB also provided grants of \nabout $1.6 million under regional technical assistance for the procurement of medical supplies \n \n14 Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data \nessential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.

Lessons  learned.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  is  exceptional  in size and  nature,  with \nevolving epidemiological and treatment scenarios. The government and development partners \nare learning from international experience and regular communication and coordination. A holistic \ngovernment  and  societal  response,  together  with  risk-based  community  interventions,  is \nessential. Health systems, protocols, and services must be adjusted to meet quality and safety \nstandards. Global supply of medical equipment and supplies constraints require the use of flexible \nprocurement and implementation arrangements. Implementation capacity must be accelerated to \nrespond effectively to the pandemic. ADB\u2019s experience in supporting countries during the severe \nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak shows the importance of partnering with technical \nagencies such as WHO; and the value of early response, planning, and building up health system \nresilience.   \n \n13.  Proposed  ADB  assistance.  The  proposed  project  is  part  of a comprehensive  ADB \npackage  that includes  budget support  through  the CARES Program  (footnote  20). It will be \ncofinanced by  AIIB to increase Uzbekistan\u2019s resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic and future \npublic  health  emergencies.  The  project  will  support  the  testing,  surveillance,  and  case \nmanagement of COVID-19 in Uzbekistan by equipping and refurbishing the national laboratory \nsystem, establishing an ICT-based national surveillance and monitoring system, and improving \nand  expanding  the  COVID-19  treatment  capacity.  Activities  will  be  coordinated  with,  and \ncomplementary to, assistance from the World Bank and other partners, and fill the remaining gaps \nin medical equipment and supplies.   \n \n14.  The  proposed  project  is  aligned  with  four  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030:  \n(i) addressing poverty and reducing inequalities through improved health access, (ii) accelerating \ngender equality through occupational safety and training targets for women, (iii) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and (iv) fostering regional cooperation through reducing \nrisks of cross-border disease transmission.22 Consistent  with the country partnership strategy \n2019\u20132023, the project will address rural-urban disparities in the quality of health care provision, \nincrease the health sector\u2019s efficiency, and contribute to the development of an e-health system.23 \nThe  project  aligns  with  Uzbekistan\u2019s  national  development  strategy  2017\u20132021,24  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy for developing the health care system, 2019\u20132025.25  \n \n \n \n \n19 ADB. 2020.

Project Description  \n \n15.  Impact and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) efficiency, \nquality,  and  accessibility  of  health  care  increased  (footnote  24),  and  (ii)  human-to-human \ntransmission of COVID-19 contained (footnote 25). The project will have the following outcome: \nresilience  to  outbreaks of  COVID-19  and other  public  health emergencies  reinforced.26  The \nproject will have three outputs. \n \n16.  Output 1: National laboratory system strengthened. The project will help increase \ndiagnostic  capacity  to  detect  COVID-19  and  future  epidemics  by  supporting  38  out  of \n671 laboratories, to increase testing capacity for COVID-19 and related diseases.27 The output \nwill  support  the  assessment  of  laboratories,  minor  refurbishment  to  ensure  safe  working \nconditions  and female and male staff convenience  such as separate sanitation facilities and \nchanging rooms, as well as procurement of laboratory equipment, PPE, test kits, reagents, and \nother supplies to increase testing capacity, and a laboratory networking and information system. \nAt least 30 of the selected laboratories will meet safety standards to Biosafety Level 2 according \nto WHO guidelines.28 Health workers and facility staff who are at high risk of infection will have \npriority access to diagnostic services. International best practices using autoclave sterilizing and \nshredding of medical waste will be pioneered in Uzbekistan.   \n  \n17.  Output 2: National surveillance and response system established for COVID-19. The \nproject will help improve  the surveillance  capacity to identify potentially  infected people and \nimprove contact tracing, including screening, testing, isolation, and referral for the treatment of \ncases, nationwide. The output will assist ASEW to (i) develop and disseminate online protocols \nand training of primary  health  care  workers  and  institutional  caretakers  to identify  potential \nCOVID-19 cases and contacts, provide appropriate advice, and use a real-time digital reporting \nsystem to report these potential cases and contacts to ASEW; (ii) develop and test this digital \nreal-time monitoring system; and (iii) strengthen screening, and collection and transportation of \nrespiratory samples to a laboratory. The project will support consulting services for designing a \nreal-time monitoring system and associated training, vehicles for surveillance, and other supplies \nto increase the surveillance capacity of ASEW nationwide.  \n \n18.  Output  3:  COVID-19  treatment  capacity  expanded.  This output  aims  at  providing \nimproved clinical care of COVID-19 patients without disruption to essential services. The project \nwill  finance  the  refurbishment,  including  sex-segregated  facilities  for  staff  and  patients,  of \n16 treatment  centers, which  consist  of 14 regional hospitals for infectious  diseases  and two \nnational  level  hospitals,  i.e.  the  Scientific  Research  Institute  of Virology  and  the Scientific \nResearch Institute of Epidemiology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases that are the designated \nCOVID-19 treatment centers. The project will support these hospitals to function as specialized \nCOVID-19 treatment centers by providing: (i) medical supplies and equipment, including for the \nexpansion of intensive care units; (ii) training of staff in infection prevention control, safety, and \nquality of care for COVID-19  patients; and, through technical  agencies, clinical and services \nguidelines; and (iii) ambulances, as required.  \n \n \n26 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n27 The  38  laboratories  consist  of one  republican  and  14  regional  laboratories  of ASEW;  one  republican  and \n14 laboratories of the AIDS Centers; one republican and three regional laboratories of the Center for the Prevention \nof Plague, Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Infections; and the Scientific Research Institute of Virology, the \nScientific Research Institute of Epidemiology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, the Institute of Sanitary and \nProfessional Diseases, and the Institute of Medical Parasitology named L.M.

The proposed emergency assistance loan meets the \neligibility criteria for ADB\u2019s emergency assistance financing as it (i) helps refurbish high-priority \nphysical  assets,  such  as hospitals and medical facilities, and restore economic, social, and \ngovernance activities; (ii) is designed to mitigate immediate losses to priority assets, capacity, or \nproductivity  (such  as  health  care  workers);  (iii)  provides  immediate  short-term  transitional \nassistance; (iv) is restricted to the transition phase and is exclusively for priority rehabilitation; and \n(v) complements  efforts by other  development  partners  to ease  the transition  from  relief to \ndevelopment.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB is active in Uzbekistan\u2019s health sector through the Primary Health Care Improvement \nProject (footnote 17). It also provided $500 million in budget support for the CARES Program to \n(i) strengthen  the  health  system  capacity  to  combat  the  spread  of  COVID-19;  (ii)  support \nbusinesses, employment, and job-creating regional public works; and (iii) expand social safety \nnets. For the health sector, the CARES Program will help the government procure ventilators, \ntesting kits, and PPE. While the CARES Program provides for immediate medical needs, the \nproposed project will support the remaining urgent needs and help Uzbekistan prepare for a \npotential resurgence of COVID-19 and future public health emergencies. The existing project \nimplementation unit (PIU) of the Primary Health Care Improvement Project (footnote 17), which \nis also engaged in COVID-19 related procurement, will help ensure efficient implementation of \nthe project. With macroeconomic support through the CARES Program, an ongoing project, and \ntechnical assistance,  ADB is providing complementary  support to Uzbekistan\u2019s health sector. \nADB\u2019s close relationship  with the government  and  key ministries,  local presence, and good \nunderstanding  of  local  procurement  practices  have  made  ADB  a trusted  partner,  allowing \ndevelopment partners such as AIIB to crowd in and trust ADB\u2019s processes.   \n  \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The  project is  estimated  to cost  $257,000,000  (Table  1).

The government has requested a concessional loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have an interest rate of 1.0% per year; \na term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; repayment of principal at 2% per year \nfor the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per year thereafter; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n23.  The government has also requested a loan not exceeding $100 million from AIIB to help \nfinance the project. The AIIB loan offers a 6-month London interbank offered rate plus a variable \nspread (up to 1.00%), a commitment fee of 0.25% per year, a front-end fee of 0.25%, a nominal \ntenor of up to 35 years, and average maturity of up to 20 years.30 The ADB and AIIB loans will \njointly finance the expenditures in relation to goods, civil works, and consulting and non-consulting \nservices, at a 50:50 ratio. The government\u2019s counterpart funding will include financing of taxes \nand  duties,  for  an  estimated  $57 million,  and  other  in-kind  contributions  such  as  project \nmanagement  support.  ADB will partially administer the AIIB loan for environment and social \nservices,  financial  management  services,  procurement  services,  investigative  services  and \ndisbursement services in accordance with ADB policies and procedures.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n24.  The project will be implemented over 24 months from August 2020 to July 2022. The loan \nis expected to be financially closed by 31 January 2023. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will be \nthe executing agency and ASEW will be the implementing agency. The MOH will appoint a senior \nstaff as project director to be responsible for overall project implementation.  The PIU will be \nexpanded with additional staff and will be responsible for the day-to-day management of project \nimplementation.  Individual  consultants  and consulting  firms  will be  recruited,  as needed, to \nsupport the monitoring  and evaluation,  procurement, bioengineering,  laboratory services, civil \nworks monitoring, procurement, and other implementation activities. Consulting firms will include \nthe following expertise: (i) building design and construction supervision, and (ii) ICT software \ndesign. \n \n25.  Among financiers, ADB will (i) partially administer the AIIB financing portion, (ii) lead the \nsupervision  and  monitoring  of  the  project,  and  (iii)  provide  the  services  identified  in  the \ncorresponding  co-lenders\u2019  agreement  to be signed between ADB and AIIB,  following ADB\u2019s \n \n30 The Government of Uzbekistan will confirm the loan conditions, including the loan maturity, amortization schedule, \nand the choice between a fixed lending spread and variable lending spread during loan negotiations in July 2020. \n ", "8 \napplicable policies and procedures. AIIB will approve withdrawal applications reviewed by ADB \nand may join in review missions.  \n \n26.  Procurement.  The response to the COVID-19  pandemic  requires quick procurement \nactions  in  a  disrupted  market  characterized  by  production  and  supply  shortages,  price \nfluctuations, logistics constraints, and a limited number of potential bidders. These impact directly \non the timely availability and quality of goods and call for more flexible procurement arrangements \nwhile maintaining the necessary due diligence. The procurement of goods, works, and consulting \nand non-consulting services financed by ADB and AIIB will follow the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time), as well as the additional exemptions endorsed following ADB\u2019s \nComprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, which among others, allow for universal \nprocurement.31  Limited  tendering  or  direct  contracting  with  United  Nations  agencies  or \ngovernment framework contracts will be used when deemed appropriate.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  Project  activities  are considered  technically  viable,  based on  the needs assessment \nconducted by ADB, ASEW, the MOH, and WHO. The project has a low climate risk category, as \nproject sites will be in urban and/or semi-urban areas with limited to no direct risks from climatic \nconditions. The equipment and infrastructure financed by the project will be standardized with \nequipment provided by other development partners to ensure compatibility and minimize training \nrequirements.  ICT systems solutions  will be assessed for compatibility,  easy integration  and \ninteroperability  with  other  ICT platforms,  and  legal  ICT  application  requirements  within  the \ncountry.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability  \n \n28.  The project outputs are expected to prevent loss of human capital and address short- and \nmedium-term gaps in the health system. Because of the short processing time available for the \nemergency  response,  due  diligence  following  ADB  guidelines  on  economic  and  financial \nanalysis will  be  conducted  during  project  implementation  within  3  months  of  project \neffectiveness.32 The financial viability assessment will be limited to the post-COVID-19 period \nsince project outputs are public service goods with no cost recovery, as the testing and treatment \nof COVID-19 are sponsored by the government. The project administration budget will include \nresources to undertake the necessary project economic and financial analysis, in compliance with \nADB requirements.  ASEW  will coordinate  data  collection to ensure that ADB  and  AIIB are \nprovided with the necessary information to undertake the project economic and financial analysis, \nin compliance with ADB and AIIB requirements. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  Strong government ownership will ensure that the developed surveillance and response \nsystem of ASEW and other project components will be sustained. The government budget will \nfund the operation and maintenance costs of the project assets after the project period. While the \ncontracts  for the procurement  of equipment  under  the project will  ensure  supplier-provided \npreventive and correct maintenance in the short term, the government\u2019s commitment to ensure \n \n32 ADB. 2000.

Manila.   \n ", "10 \nadequate budget allocations for operation and maintenance during and after the project will be \ncovenanted in the financing agreement and monitored during project implementation. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n30.  In 2019, ADB completed a governance risk assessment according to the implementation \nguidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.33 Uzbekistan needs to \nimprove its performance in governance\u2014e.g., effectiveness, rule of law, and accountability. Its \npublic financial management  is deemed reliable in budget credibility, debt management, and \ntreasury functions, but has weaknesses in transparency, public participation, off-budget funding, \ninternal audit, and external audit. The new public financial management reforms aim to improve \nthe tax administration, introduce a medium-term budget framework, establish international public \nsector accounting and audit standards, and strengthen external audit.34 \n \n31.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial mainly because of \n(i) the emergency nature of the project; (ii) the need for hiring and training new PIU financial \nmanagement staff on ADB project guidelines for the financial management and loan disbursement \nprocess; (iii) the required migration of project financial reporting from Microsoft Excel spreadsheet \nto the 1C accounting information system; and (iv) the potential risk of loan funds being used for \nother  purposes.  Key  risk  mitigating  strategies  are  set  out  in  the  financial  management \nassessment\u2019s action plan and are due by project effectiveness. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended  to  date)  was explained  to  and discussed  with MOH  and ASEW.  The  specific \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s  project  procurement  risk assessment  concluded  that  the  procurement  risk  is \nmoderate mainly because of the scale of procurement to be carried out under difficult conditions, \nwhile  it  recognizes  the  executing  agency  and  the  PIU are  familiar  with  ADB  procurement \nprocedures. Accordingly, capacity of the current PIU for the Primary Health Care Improvement \nProject  will  be  enhanced  with  additional  consultants.  The  government  is  also  planning  to \nstrengthen procurement rules to enhance transparency, including subjecting all procurement of \nemergency supplies to an ex-post audit by the Audit Chamber with results published on the \nMinistry of Investments and Foreign Trade website.  \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  In 2018, 11.4% of the population lived below the national poverty line (footnote 23). About \n1.3% of the population  is estimated to have already slipped below the poverty line for lower \nmiddle-income countries ($3.2 per person per day in purchasing power parity terms) following the \noutbreak (footnote 7). However, this underestimates a larger impact, especially on households \ndependent on remittances from migrant workers. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a much \nhigher impact on the poor and near-poor as a result of lower access to information and services, \nthe lockdown resulting in the loss of jobs during and after the pandemic, and the increasing cost \nof food and medical and other services. Therefore, by containing COVID-19 and other public \nhealth emergencies, the project is expected to reduce the poor\u2019s hardship, while benefiting all \ncitizens of Uzbekistan. \n \n33 ADB. 2006.

In \nUzbekistan, about 80% of health workers are female, and more than 80% of the infected health \nworkers were women as of 26 May 2020. The government has developed standardized testing \nprotocols that would increase access to testing for female health workers, and prioritize testing \nbased on risk level. It has also approved a resolution that outlines additional remuneration for \nhealth workers involved in COVID-19 treatment and control. The following gender designs and \ntargets have been agreed with the MOH: (i) all frontline staff in 16 project hospitals will be trained \nin infection prevention control and, where applicable, patient management to treat COVID-19 \ncases and other infectious respiratory diseases; (ii) access to testing for health workers and \npregnant women will be prioritized; (iii) a COVID-19 monitoring system will be established and \noperational with sex- and age-disaggregated data; (iv) sex-segregated facilities will be provided \nfor health workers and separate female and male wards for patients; (v) well-fitting PPE and \nsanitary supplies will be provided; and (vi) sex-disaggregated data on rates of infection among \nmedical and support staff will be regularly collected, monitored, and reported.  \n   \nF.  Safeguards \n  \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.35 \n \n36.  Environment  (category  B).  Small-scale  refurbishment  works  will be  carried  out  to \nprepare health facilities for ensuring staff and patient safety and installing medical equipment. The \ninfectious medical waste produced during the operation of laboratories and treatment centers will \nrequire proper management and disposal. An environmental assessment and review framework \nhas been prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. An initial environmental examination study \nwill be undertaken during implementation before the start of any rehabilitation works. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C). The project  will not  result  in any new land \nacquisition, as civil works are limited to the minor refurbishment and repair of 54 laboratories and \nother medical facilities. This will be reconfirmed following the detailed design. An involuntary \nresettlement screening checklist has been included in the environmental assessment and review \nframework to screen subprojects for any involuntary resettlement  related impacts before the \naward of civil works contracts. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No communities or groups within the project area may \nbe considered indigenous peoples, as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nHence, no indigenous peoples communities are expected to be affected by the project. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n39.

The government has  assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement as described \nin detail in the PAM and loan documents.  The government  has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement.
