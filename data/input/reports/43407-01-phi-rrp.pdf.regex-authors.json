I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Social Protection Support Project. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  Capacity  Development  for  Social \nProtection, and Strengthened Gender Impacts of Social Protection, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA grants. \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  in  implementing  and \nexpanding  its  social  protection  agenda,  especially  the  conditional  cash  transfer  (CCT) \nprogram\u2014Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program1 (4Ps) and the national household targeting \nsystem  for  poverty  reduction  (NHTS-PR).  The  associated  capacity  development  TAs  will \nsupport capacity development and institutional strengthening of the government for efficient \nimplementation of the social protection agenda.2 The project is included in the Philippines \ncountry operations business plan, 2010\u20132012.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Despite high economic growth over the past 6 years, poverty incidence in the Philippines \nincreased from 30% in 2003 to 33% in 2006. Key causes of poverty include high inequality and \nchronic underinvestment in physical and human capital, especially health and education. As a \nresult, the Philippines is lagging on progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \ntargets for universal primary education, maternal mortality, and access to reproductive health \nservices. Net enrollment in elementary school declined from 99.1% in 1990 to 83.2% in 2007. \nOnly 70% of students who enter grade 1 stay until grade 6, and one in five children 6\u201311 years old \nare  not  in  school.  Universal  immunization  against  measles  has  not  yet  been  achieved  and \nmalnutrition remains a major concern, with only 64% of children meeting normal weight-for-age \nstandards. Maternal mortality rates remain high at 162 per 100,000 live births in 2006.  \n \n4.  Government estimates indicate that about 45% of Filipinos are vulnerable to falling into \npoverty if confronted by external shocks such as family health problems and deaths, loss of \nemployment,  natural  disasters,  and  price  increases.4 In  2007\u20132008,  escalating  food  prices \ncontributed to a 9.45% reduction in the average standard of living and an increase of more than \n50% in the severity of poverty.5 In the absence of appropriate safety nets, households have \ndeveloped  coping  mechanisms  to  external  shocks  that  tend  to  erode  human  capital  and \nperpetuate poverty, such as increasing working hours, changing eating patterns, withdrawing \nchildren from school, or foregoing critical health care.   \n \n5.  Demand-side  constraints,  such  as  financial  barriers  and  lack  of  awareness  of  the \nimportance  of  human  capital  investment,  are  key  constraints  to  utilization  of  health  and \neducation services by the poor. Although many public health services are free, health facilities \n                                                 \n1  Building Bridges for the Filipino Family Program. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance to the Philippines for \nSupport for Conditional Cash Transfers (approved 21 December 2009).  \n3  ADB. 2009.

Manila: ADB.  \n ", "2 \nare often located in areas not easily accessible to poor families, leading to high transport costs. \nThe average cost for travel to health facilities is P109 per visit, while outpatient treatment is \nP1,872 per person.6 Nearly half of the health care costs are paid out-of-pocket, and 79% of poor \nhouseholds have no insurance coverage. The poor are often unable to afford basic health care \nsince out-of-pocket payments are required at the point of services. For education, demand-side \nfactors are the main determinants of enrollment. Among girls 7\u201312 years old, the main reasons \nfor being out of school are high associated costs and lack of interest. From 2002 to 2007, the \nnumber of out-of-school youth rose markedly for children 13\u201316 years old, reaching more than \n20% in many regions.7 The leading causes were high cost of education (particularly for girls), \nlack of personal interest (particularly for boys), and working or looking for work. \n \n6.  Government efforts to address poverty and improve human development outcomes have \nbeen compromised by low spending on social sectors, particularly social assistance programs. \nIn 2009, national government spending on social services was only 5.9% of gross domestic \nproduct. Spending on social protection was even lower at only 1.2%, although it has increased \nfrom an average of 0.8% in 2005\u20132007. The social protection sector has been characterized by \na  lack  of  policy  and  institutional  coordination,  with  several  departments  undertaking \nuncoordinated, and sometimes ineffective, programs. Benefits have been further compromised \nby weak targeting systems to identify beneficiaries and high leakages to the non-poor. \n \n7.  To  respond  to  these  challenges,  the  government  recently  increased  its  focus  on \nreforming  and  strengthening  its  social  protection  system.  The  reform  agenda  led  by  the \nDepartment  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development  (DSWD)  includes  (i)  accelerating  social \nprotection policy reform; (ii) improving targeting of programs; (iii) expanding the CCT program \nand strengthening delivery mechanisms, including governance systems and monitoring and \nevaluation;  and  (iv)  securing  adequate  and  predictable  financing  for  social  protection  by \nconsolidating programs and gradually expanding overall budget allocation. The reform agenda \nis well under way and significant government ownership is demonstrated through a doubling of \nthe social protection budget since 2007. The budget of DSWD, which has the primary role in \ndelivering social protection services, has more than tripled since 2007; these increases are \nsustained through the medium-term expenditure plan, 2010\u20132014. \n \n \n8.  The cornerstone of the social protection reform effort is the CCT program (4Ps). The 4Ps \nprovides cash grants to poor households based on their fulfillment of health- and education-\nrelated  conditionalities.  The  program  pilot  was  launched  in  2007  with  6,000  beneficiary \nhouseholds in four municipalities and two cities. Results from the pilot showed that from 2007 to \n2009,  school  enrollment  and  attendance  rates  increased  significantly,  elementary  school \ncompletion  rates  increased  from  67.5%  to  73%,  the  number  of  children  who  received \ndeworming pills increased by 21.4%, the number of fully immunized children increased by \n26.2% and the number of women who completed prenatal visits increased by 45.4%.8 The 4Ps \ngradually expanded to 341,000 households in 2008 (set 1), 666,000 households in 2009 (set 2), \nand aims to reach 1 million households in 2010 (set 3).9  \n \n9.  The  4Ps  directly  addresses  poverty  through  the  provision  of  cash  grants,  while \nsimultaneously reducing long-term poverty through increased investments in human capital, a \n                                                 \n6  National Statistics Office. 2008.

Set 1: 341,000 households, set 2: 325,000 households, set 3: currently at 257,995 \nhouseholds.  Sets  are  defined  by  poverty  ranking  (poorest  municipalities  phased  in  first).  The  program  is \nnationwide, and covers the poorest households in 733 municipalities in 80 provinces. \n ", "3 \nkey factor in addressing intergenerational poverty. Cash transfers help meet the direct and \nindirect costs of health care and schooling, as well as reduce the incentive to remove children \nfrom school to work. The program also promotes utilization of education and health services and \nother positive behavior changes through family development sessions focusing on responsible \nparenthood, health and nutrition, and education.  \n   \n10.  Several development partners have helped develop and are supporting the evolving \nsocial  protection  reform  agenda.  The  World  Bank  is  providing  a  $405  million  loan.  The \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  provided  grant  support  for  the \ndevelopment of the good governance and anticorruption aspects of the 4Ps, monitoring and \nevaluation, and improved auditing.10 The Japan International Cooperation Agency provided \nsupport for the CCT program through the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP) 311 and \nfiscal stimulus support in 2010. In addition, Japan and the Republic of Korea provided TA for the \n4Ps through the World Bank; the United Nations Development Programme supports the policy \nagenda; and the United Nations Children's Fund is in current discussions with DSWD to support \nthe 4Ps.  \n \n11.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is a key partner in the social protection reform \nagenda.  The  three  DPSPs  in  2007,  2008,  and  2009  supported  policy  dialogue  on  social \nprotection  reform,  including  improved  targeting  and  poverty  orientation  of  public  spending. \nDPSP 2 and DPSP 3 provided support for piloting and scaling up the 4Ps. In addition, fiscal \nstimulus support under the Countercyclical Support Facility12 (2009) included increasing the \ncoverage of the program.13 ADB and the government have had continuous dialogue through the \nPhilippines  Development  Forum  subgroup  on  social  protection  and  ADB-organized  large \nregional conferences on social protection in 2009 and 2010.  \n \n12.  The  proposed  project  will  assist  the  government  in  implementing  its  development \nstrategy  and  social  protection  reform  by  supporting  the  NHTS-PR  and  the  4Ps.  This  is \nconsistent with ADB's support for the Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan and the \nmutual objectives of higher pro-poor sustainable growth and MDG attainment. The support has \nsignificant  potential  for  leveraging  key  improvements  in  the  Philippines'  social  protection \nportfolio, including improved targeting, reduced leakage, and rationalization and consolidation of \nexisting programs. The ADB assistance will provide additional support to strengthen the gender \nand indigenous peoples aspects of the 4Ps. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the project will be reduced income poverty and non income poverty. The \noutcome will be increased consumption and utilization of education and health services among \npoor households and women beneficiaries of the 4Ps.  \n \n                                                 \n10  These include support for the NHTS-PR, grievance redress, compliance verification; monitoring and spot checks; \nimproved audits; and institutional strengthening. AusAID is currently developing a TA facility for DSWD and \ndevelopment partners to provide technical and analytical support for the CCT program. \n11  ADB. 2009.

The project will support implementation and expansion of the 4Ps in set 2 and 3 areas \n(footnote 9), and cover about 582,000 households14 in 436 municipalities and 37 cities in 53 \nprovinces.  \n \n15.  Output 1: Efficient implementation of a national targeting system to select poor \nhouseholds.  This  output  will  support  implementation  of  the  NHTS-PR  as  a  standardized \ntargeting mechanism for identifying poor households. The NHTS-PR targets poor households in \ntwo  steps:  (i)  selection  of  poor  provinces  and  municipalities  based  on  poverty  incidence \naccording to the family income and expenditure survey and small area estimates; (ii) use of a \nproxy  means  test  methodology  to  predict  household  income  on  the  basis  of  education, \nsocioeconomic characteristics, housing conditions, access to basic services, assets, tenure \nstatus, and regional variables. The information to calculate the proxy means test is collected \nthrough  household  assessments,  encoded  online  regionally  and  transmitted  to  DSWD \nnationally. The lists of poor households are validated in community assemblies and through spot \nchecks and cross-checking with the family income and expenditure survey data.  \n \n16.  DSWD  is  implementing  the  NHTS-PR  nationwide  and  is  planning  to  assess  about \n8.3 million households. Experience from the 4Ps pilot shows that the targeting system has \nperformed well, with an inclusion error of less than 10%.15 When finalized, it will constitute a \nhomogenous  and  transparent  mechanism  to  identify  poor  households  and  a  nationwide \ndatabase that can be used by various national and local social protection and poverty reduction \nprograms. An executive order issued in March 2010 requires all government agencies to use \nthe system for household targeting of poor households in their programs. \n \n17.  Output  2:  Conditional  health  and  education  cash  grants  provided  to  poor \nhouseholds.  This  output  will  partially  finance  conditional  health  and  education  grants  in \nselected poor provinces, municipalities, and cities. Beneficiary households are selected using \nthe  NHTS-PR  and  validated  for  eligibility.16 DSWD  pays  the  transfers  to  mothers  and/or \npregnant women of eligible households, who will receive the cash grants for up to 5 years \nsubject to the eligibility criteria and compliance.17 Transfers are paid quarterly, directly into \nwomen beneficiaries' accounts established in the Land Bank of the Philippines.18 The 4Ps \nincludes two types of transfers: one related to health and one to education. A computerized \ncompliance verification system will verify compliance with conditionalities.19  \n \n18.  Poor households with children 0\u201314 years old and/or pregnant women are eligible for a \nhealth grant currently set at P500 ($11) per household per month (for 12 months per year). The \nconditionalities are: (i) all children 0\u20135 years old attend the health center to obtain services \nestablished by the Department of Health (DOH) according to their age, including immunizations; \n(ii) pregnant women attend the health center according to DOH protocol, including delivery by \n                                                 \n14  The World Bank loan is financing the 4Ps in set 1 areas, covering around 341,000 households.  \n15  The percentage of non-poor households included in the program. In comparison, programs in Latin America and \nSouth Asia have inclusion errors of around 30%. These errors tend to increase as programs scale up due to higher \ndensity of poverty in pilot areas.  \n16  Eligible households are those included in the NHTS-PR database with children 0\u201314 years old and/or a pregnant \nmother. \n17  In households with no mother, the grant is paid to another responsible adult in the family (father, grandparent).  \n18 In some cases, over the counter payments are done if there is a long distance to the nearest bank branch or when \nissuance of cash cards is delayed.  \n19  This entails associating beneficiaries with schools and clinics, recording attendance, encoding attendance through \na computerized system, and linking such data to the payment system. Beneficiaries who repeatedly do not comply \nwith the conditions will be suspended from the program following an established sanctions procedure.   \n ", "5 \nskilled  personnel  and  postnatal  care;  (iii)  children  6\u201314  years  old  comply  with  deworming \nprotocol  at  schools;  and  (iv)  the  household  grantee  (mother)  and/or  spouse  attend  family \ndevelopment sessions at least once a month.  \n \n19.  Poor households with children 6\u201314 years old are eligible for the education grant.20 The \neducation transfer is P300 ($7) per child per month (for 10 months per year), for up to a \nmaximum of three children. Beneficiary households will receive the education transfer for each \nchild from 6 to 14 years of age as long as they are enrolled in primary or secondary school and \nmaintain a class attendance rate of at least 85% every month.  \n \n20.  Eligible households can receive both the health and education grants.21 The average \ntransfer per household is estimated at 23% of the average annual household income. This \nproportion is in the range of those used in successful CCT programs in Latin America, where \ngrants  provided  a  sufficient  incentive  for  families  to  utilize  health  services  and  send  their \nchildren to school, while being low enough to avoid distorting labor market decisions.22  \n \n21.  Meeting the supply-side requirements and monitoring compliance are the responsibilities \nof DOH, the Department of Education, and local government units (LGUs).23 A supply-side \nassessment is done to assess health and education systems, identify gaps and needs, if any, \nand corresponding solutions and recommendations to enable 4Ps beneficiaries to meet the \nconditionalities of the program.24 Anecdotal evidence suggests that several LGUs are increasing \ntheir investments in health and education services as a result of these supply-side pressures.  \n \n22.  Output 3: Strengthened capacity for conditional cash transfer program operations. \nThis  output  will  provide  capacity  development  and  support  for  all  key  national  and  local \nmanagement activities in the 4Ps, including household registration, compliance verification, \npayment management, organization of assemblies of grantees, and strengthening of gender \nand indigenous peoples aspects.  \n \n23.  Output 4: Improved systems for monitoring and evaluation of social protection \nprograms. This output will support the implementation of a management information system \nthat will cover all steps in the operation of the 4Ps. It will also support monitoring and evaluation, \nincluding (i) spot checks to monitor 4Ps implementation; (ii) monitoring and evaluation studies;25 \nand (iii) regular monitoring and reporting, including quarterly and annual reviews, and internal \naudits. It will also support the operation of a grievance redress system, featuring a publicly \naccessible  grievance  database  to  track  and  resolve  complaints,  including  targeting  errors, \npayment irregularities, fraud, and corruption.   \n \n                                                 \n20  DSWD is also implementing cash grants to households with children 3\u20135 years old that regularly attend day care or \npreschool. Based on further study, ADB will consider including support for these grants at project midterm. \n21  The maximum transfer a household can receive is P15,000 per year for 5 years.  \n22  In Mexico (Oportunidades), the transfer is about 21% of total annual household expenditures; in Colombia \n(Familias en Accion), about 15% of the minimum wage; and in Nicaragua (Red de Proteccion Social) about 17% of \nthe total annual household expenditure. Impact evaluations of these programs show significant positive impacts on \nfamily investments in children\u2019s human capital. A very low transfer, such as in the Honduras CCT program \nrepresenting less than 5% of average per capita consumption, showed less impact on families\u2019 human capital. \n23  Responsibilities of each department are described in a joint memorandum circular. Coordination is governed by \nnational, regional, and municipal advisory committees, and by a memorandum of agreement that clarifies lines of \nauthority and responsibility between DSWD and participating LGUs. \n24 In the event that a barangay is not prepared to meet the supply-side requirements, the LGU will be given 6 months \nto address the problem(s) before program implementation may start. \n25  This will include qualitative evaluation studies and impact evaluation. ADB and the World Bank are exploring \ncollaboration on a rigorous impact evaluation using regression continuity methodology.  \n ", "6 \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n24.  The overall government program has a total estimated cost of $1.29 billion26 from 2009\u2013\n2014.  The  World  Bank  is  financing  one-third  of  the  program  with  a  loan  of  $405  million \n(approved in 2009), the proposed ADB loan will finance one-third, and the government will \nfinance one-third.  \n \n25.  The project is estimated to cost $884.2 million. The government requested a loan of \n$400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) to finance the project.27 The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. ADB will finance \n45.2% of the project cost and the government will provide counterpart financing of 54.8% \nincluding taxes and duties, and financing changes. The government will allocate the counterpart \nfunds of $484.2 million mainly to cover a share of the household grants, capacity building, and \nadministrative costs.28 The financing plan is in Table 1 and the project investment plan is in \nTable 2. \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank    400.0    45.2 \nGovernment of the Philippines    484.2    54.8 \n   Total  884.2  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.        \n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million)\n \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  DSWD  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  project  will  support  the  national  project \nmanagement offices of the NHTS and 4Ps, both of which are established and operating. DSWD \nand the regional project management offices have overall responsibility for implementing the \nprogram. Municipal links are hired to work with beneficiary households, and the LGUs are \ndesignating at least one full-time staff for the 4Ps. \n \n \n27.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual. To ensure efficient project implementation, joint supervision \nmissions will be undertaken by the government, ADB, and the World Bank.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2010\u2013September 2015 \nEstimated project completion date  30 September 2015 (loan closing date: 31 March 2016) \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  DSWD executive committee; secretary of DSWD (chair); all undersecretaries \nand assistant secretaries, DSWD (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  DSWD \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  DSWD, DSWD regional offices (16)  \n(iv)  Project implementation unit  NPMO (NHTS): 20 staff; NPMO (4Ps): 109 staff \nProcurement  Shopping  6 contracts  $578,000 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection   1 contract  $500,000 \nFixed budget selection  4 contracts  $400,000 \nSingle-source selection  5 contracts  $500,000 \nIndividual consultant system  2,931 person-months  $1,961,095 a \nRetroactive financing   NHTS, 4Ps cash grants for education.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n28.  ADB will provide capacity development TA to improve social protection delivery at the \nnational and local levels. The outcome will be strengthened capacity of DSWD to implement the \nsocial protection reform agenda. The TA will have four outputs: (i) strengthened and accelerated \nimplementation of the computerized verification system; (ii) improved capacity for monitoring \nand evaluation, including civil society monitoring, and implementation of the grievance redress \nsystem; (iii) review of the NHTS-PR aimed at facilitating the rollout of the system to other \ngovernment agencies; and (iv) a study on integration of early childhood care and development \ninto the 4Ps. The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, of which $800,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment will provide $200,000 equivalent (in-kind) as counterpart support.  \n \n29.  ADB  will  also  administer  TA  to  (i)  undertake  participatory  gender  audits  of  the \nimplementation processes and impact of the 4Ps; (ii) design community-driven and municipal \n ", "8 \ngender  action  plans  based  on  the  specific  needs  of  beneficiaries;  (iii)  provide  grants  to \nmunicipalities to operationalize the gender action plans; and (iv) prepare knowledge products \nrelated to management of gender in the CCT program. The TA is estimated to cost $425,000, of \nwhich $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Gender and Development Cooperation  \nFund.29 The government will provide $125,000 equivalent (in-kind) as counterpart support. \n \n30.  Policy advisory TA to support the policy agenda for rationalization and convergence of \nsocial protection programs will also be prepared.30 The TA will (i) formulate and implement an \naction plan for rationalization and coordination of social protection programs; (ii) build national \nand local institutional capacity to support the social protection reform agenda; and (iii) support \nDSWD  in  establishing  a  referral  system  for  the  poorest  population,  linked  to  the  national \nhousehold targeting system.31  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n31.  Inclusive growth in the Philippines has been constrained by gaps in human capital \ninvestment,  which  are  largely  driven  by  demand-side  factors.  Evidence  of  CCTs  globally \nsuggests  the  4Ps  can  effectively  (i)  address  short-term  poverty  and  vulnerability;  and \n(ii) improve education and health outcomes, leading to longer-term gains in productivity and \nbreak  down  of  intergenerational  poverty  traps.  Accurate  targeting  will  maximize  the  direct \nbenefits of the 4Ps grants. The project is also expected to significantly increase the efficiency of \ngovernment investments in poverty reduction and social protection. Simulations suggest that \nmainstreaming the NHTS-PR could decrease leakage under three other programs by enough to \noffset the annual cost of 4Ps grants to at least 780,000 households. Even without such savings, \ngiven the government's strong commitment to the 4Ps and NHTS-PR, and the relatively modest \nsize of the programs (with annual costs estimated at 0.7% of the budget and 0.17% of gross \ndomestic product), project benefits are considered to be financially viable and sustainable.   \n \nB.  Governance \n \n32.  At the country level, lack of effective sanctions coupled with limited public accountability \nand political interference requires robust systems for corruption prevention and redress. At the \nproject level, DSWD is considered an anticorruption champion in the government. A 2009 \nintegrity development review of DSWD via technical assistance from AusAID and the World \nBank found that DSWD has several control mechanisms in place to minimize corruption risks. \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  addressing  gaps  in  accounting  and  auditing.  The \nintegrity development review also identified gaps that need attention to improve governance and         \nmitigate corruption risks, including (i) adherence to budgeting, accounting, and auditing rules; (ii) \nimproved  risk  assessment  and  mitigation;  and  (iii)  corruption  risk  management  through \npartnership with anticorruption nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \n33.  Like most CCT programs, the 4Ps presents particular implementation challenges from a \ngovernance perspective, including its large scope and high volume of financial transactions; its \nengagement of multiple government agencies; and many project locations in remote areas. \nHowever, these challenges are paired with some key advantages, including being implemented \nby a champion department with regard to anticorruption; a very small amount of procurement, \nreducing the prospects of corruption; direct payment to beneficiary bank accounts, reducing \n                                                 \n29  Contributors: the governments of Canada, the Netherlands, and Norway. \n30  This TA will be processed separately from the loan.  \n31  The system will involve tracking 4Ps beneficiaries to facilitate referral to complementary services. \n ", "9 \nopportunities of local intervention; and inclusion of strong anticorruption mitigation measures in \nthe project design. These include (i) interagency governance structures from national down to \nmunicipal levels; (ii) beneficiary targeting based on objective, poverty-based criteria; (iii) robust \nmonitoring  and  audit  systems,  including  spot  checks,  and  civil  society  oversight;  and                \n(iv) transparency and accountability through public information campaigns and a grievance \nredress  system.  To  ensure  that  these  measures  are  well  implemented,  DSWD  is  hiring \nadditional 4Ps staff and intensifying its training activities. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with DSWD. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty and social impacts. Improved survival, health, and education of children and \nwomen are direct benefits of the project. Better health and education utilization will promote \nemployability and productivity of the next generation of workers. Regular and reliable cash \ntransfers over 5 years will help promote savings and enable households to invest in livelihood-\nenhancing activities and facilitate their movement out of poverty. The project's support for the \nNHTS-PR will ensure that a standardized and transparent mechanism and database is in place, \nand facilitate identification and targeting of poor families. The project will strengthen DSWD's \ninstitutional  management  and  administrative  capacity  to  scale  up  the  4Ps,  contributing  to \nDSWD's effectiveness in delivering social welfare programs. \n \n35.  Gender impacts. Women are a main target group of the 4Ps. Key gender issues that \nthe project will address include (i) low utilization of health care by women, especially obstetric \nand maternal care; (ii) high infant morbidity and mortality, and their effects on women's work \nburdens; (iii) insufficient allocation of resources for the health and education of female children; \n(iv) intrahousehold gender roles and control over resources; and (v) poor women's limited \naccess to income and economic resources. The gender action plan (i) ensures that bank \naccounts are opened in women's names; (ii) supports training of women on citizenship and \nrights, domestic violence, leadership, child care, and nutrition; (iii) targets 70% attendance of \nfathers in specially designed modules on gender-responsive family practices and the role of \nfathers  as  caregivers;  (iv)  encourages  linkages  with  NGOs  and  other  service  providers  to \nsupport access to complementary services; (v) develops staff capacity on gender issues; and \n(vi) ensures integration of gender equality indicators in the monitoring and evaluation system. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n36.  The project includes about 9,000 indigenous peoples household beneficiaries, who are \namong  the  poorest  and  most  marginalized  households  in  the  Philippines.  The  project  will \nsignificantly  improve  the  health,  education,  and  income  status  of  these  households.  Key \nmeasures  include  (i) information  and  training  provided  to  indigenous  peoples  in  a  form \nappropriate to their language and cultures; (ii) working with indigenous leaders and local NGOs \nto  mobilize  indigenous  households  to  participate  in  the  program;  (iii)  seeking  transport \nassistance for indigenous peoples through coordination with LGUs or NGOs; (iv) targets of 10% \nindigenous women and 12% indigenous peoples total for municipal link positions in indigenous \nareas; and (v) sensitivity training and coaching to all 4Ps staff. The project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  indigenous  peoples,  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nenvironment, in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nE.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n38.  The government and DSWD have assured ADB that implementation of the project will \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and draft loan agreement.  It is a condition for withdrawal of \nloan proceeds for the conditional grants that agreed compliance verification procedures have \nbeen instituted and are being used as the basis for beneficiary payments, as also described in \nthe project administration manual and draft loan agreement. \n \nVI.
