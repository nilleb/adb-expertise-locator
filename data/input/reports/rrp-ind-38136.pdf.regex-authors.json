The Project represents a first direct \nintervention by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) into a \nlonger-term  endeavor  planned  by  J&K.  It  is  part  of  a \nbroader economic turnaround plan defined by the central \nand state governments.  In this first phase, the priorities laid \nout by the State are the restoration of facilities needed to \ndeliver a  minimum water service in the two main cities, \nJammu and Srinagar, and the rehabilitation of key roads \nand  bridges  in  14  districts.  The  Project  will  upgrade \ninherently sound facilities now in a poor state of repair. The \nobjective is to increase their quality and life span. This will \nsave money later but, more importantly, it will raise the \nquality of life of people now. This rehabilitation mandate will \nbe accompanied by a structured and long-term capacity \nbuilding  component,  in  essence  to  help  with  project \nimplementation itself, but also to strengthen the ability of \nexecuting agencies to do more, faster and better in the \nfuture.  \n \nRationale  The quality of roads, bridges and water service facilities has \ndeteriorated rapidly over the years, largely on account of \nlimited financial resources but also because of less than \nadequate  continuity  in  their  maintenance  and  general \nupkeep.  This  situation  impacts  badly  on  the  social  and \nhealth/sanitary  conditions  of  communities,  particularly  in \nkey urban centers affected by significant migrant influx in \nrecent years. But the situation also impacts on the mobility \nof  people  and  goods/services.  This  curtails  employment \nopportunities,  income  creation  and  ultimately  general \nwelfare.  A  set  of  targeted  investments  like  the  ones \nproposed will not deal with all the economic and social \nproblems in the State at one go. But they will be a start. \nIndeed, these investments if adequately executed will go a ", "i v \nIndeed, these investments if adequately executed will go a \nlong way to making life better for a large number of people, \nespecially in the short to medium term. These investments \nalso pave the way for others.   \n \nTourism is potentially the main business activity, but visitors \nmay stay away unless the enabling infrastructure facilities \nand access to the State can be improved and made more \nsecure.  Horticulture,  agribusiness  and  selected \nmanufacturing are prospective growth areas, but investors \nneed to have access to inputs and markets on time and in a \ncost-effective  manner.  Trade,  competitiveness,  attractive \nproduction cost structures and ultimately productivity need \ngood  logistics  and  associated  infrastructure  and  utility \nfacilities. The economic recovery plan being put in place by \nthe State also requires stability, reinforced by a stronger \nenabling environment.  \n \nTotal infrastructure rehabilitation needs in J&K are high and \ngrowing. Several targeted interventions will be required in \nthe future to deal with both rehabilitation and the creation of \nnew assets. It is intended that this first intervention by ADB \nin J&K will focus on urgent rehabilitation of the existing \ninfrastructure. This be followed by sequential projects in \nurban, road and power sectors, subject to Board approval, \nstarting with an urban infrastructure development project in \n2006. The latter will finance additional rehabilitation needs \nin the two principal cities not addressed under this Project \nbut it will also cater for the creation of selected new facilities \nin areas where there are either none or their coverage is \nlimited at present. This Project will also help strengthen the \ninstitutional capacity on the ground, a precursor for new and \nfollow-on investments.   \n \nThe  State  is  responding  to  the  challenge  by  taking \nmeasures  now  that  will  help  improve  this  capacity  and \ninstitutional set up. A nodal agency was set up in July 2004 \n(Economic Reconstruction Agency, ERA) to help with the \ncoordination of all externally funded development projects \nin the State, including the proposed operation.  The agency \nneeds finance, people and systems. Advisory services for \nproject management, training and policy/planning support \nare all an integral part of an institutional package proposed \nunder the Project. Besides helping ERA, this component \nwill  also  provide  special  support  to  the  various  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  linked  to  the  rehabilitation \nproposal. In this fashion, the operation meets the longer-\nterm institutional building needs of government with shorter-\nterm  project  management  requirements  \u2013  guided \nthroughout by transparency and efficiency principles.  \n ", "v   \nThe  Project  has  been  prepared  and  processed  under \nunique and unconventional circumstances. It had to adapt \nto the very specific and special situation on the ground, \nsecurity  being  a  major  consideration.  In  spite  of  this \nsituation, ADB undertook to respond to  the Government\u2019s \nrequest in a proactive manner. In preparing the Project on a \nfast track basis but as part of normal lending operations, \ntiming  and  flexibility  are  of  paramount  importance. \nInvestment  proposals  have  been  prepared  by  the  State \nwithout  the  benefits  of  project  preparation  technical \nassistance  (PPTA).  The  project  team  used  these \ninvestment proposals as the starting point, and conducted \nthorough  investigations  and  due  diligence  for  selected \nsample subprojects with regard to technical, economic and \ninstitutional  viability  and  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards. For the rest of the subprojects, the prescribed \neligibility criteria will be applied so as to ensure that the \nsubprojects  selected  will  be  straightforward  rehabilitation \ninvestments  with  no  major  environmental  and  social \nadverse impact being involved.  Furthermore, frameworks \nfor environmental assessment, resettlement and indigenous \npeople  development  were  developed  to  ensure  the \ncompliance with ADB's safeguard policies.  \n \nThe Project has inherent risks. The institutional capability of \nERA and PIUs is untested. Security is another risk factor \nthat  cannot  be  completely  controlled  by  risk  mitigation \nmeasures incorporated in the Project. The cost of project \nadministration is expected to be high. However, the Project \nteam  is  of  the  view  that  the  risks  of  doing  nothing  far \noutweigh the risks of moving forward with a rehabilitation of \nselected, simple and existing assets.   \n   \nObjective   The Project is primarily designed for the rehabilitation of \nessential infrastructure in the urban and transport sectors of \nJ&K.  Water supply and drainage system improvement will \nraise the quality of life of the urban populations in Srinagar \nand Jammu. Road and bridge financing will improve rural \nconnectivity and facilitate trade within the State. The Project \nalso  targets  capacity  building  of  the  executing  agency, \nwhich  will  lead  to  better  planning,  improved  policy \nformulation and the introduction of more reliable project \nimplementation  skills,  systems  and  criteria.  Capacity \nmeasures  will  improve  transparency  and  efficiency.  The \nunderlying objective is to underpin an economic turnaround.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The original request for finance by the State exceeded $1.3 \nbillion. The proposed investment package  has been cut \ndown to less than one third, i.e. $358 million which covers \n$167 million of foreign exchange costs and $191 million \nequivalent in local currency.

Goods and related services valued at \n$500,000 or more will be procured through ICB, while those \nestimated to cost between $100,000 and $500,000 will be \nprocured through international shopping (IS).

Consultants  will  be  engaged \nusing ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection procedures, \nall  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe engagement of domestic consultants.   \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project targets rural and urban communities, in the \nBeneficiaries  latter case with a special focus on Srinagar and Jammu.  \nRural  beneficiaries  include  farmers,  agribusiness \ncompanies, and other service providers.  At the urban level, \nthe  beneficiaries  will  be  end-users falling within priority \nwater service coverage areas.    \n  \nThe investments are economically viable. The investments \nadd value to existing assets funded in the past with public \nfunds,  enhance  trade  and  connectivity  and  improve \nminimum  health/sanitation  standards  in  two  significant \nurban centers.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The proposed Project will be accompanied by a technical \nassistance (TA) grant for preparation of a project related to \nwater, wastewater and waste management in the two main \ncities\u2014Jammu and Srinagar. The objective of this future \nproject is to deepen the rehabilitation work started under the \nproposed operation, but also to extend the coverage, quality \nand continuity of both water and other services in these \nurban  areas.  The  future  investment  will  also  look  into \nreforms needed to make the delivery of water services more \ncost effective, efficient and sustainable over time. The total \ncost of the TA is estimated at $630,000. The Government of \nthe United Kingdom will provide a $500,000 grant towards \nthis. The State will finance the balance. ADB will administer \nthis TA.  A consulting firm will be engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality and cost-based method of selection under ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. The Executing Agency for the TA will be ERA. \n   \n ", "v iii \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  is  fundamentally  sound  but  it  will  be \nimplemented under circumstances of (i) limited institutional \ncapacity and (ii) some security concerns. The first risk can \nbe tackled through specific operational support for project \nmanagement and design and construction supervision. The \ninstitutional  capacity  of  ERA  will  be  strengthened  by \ncapacity  building  training  and  operational  support  by  a \nproject management consultant (PMC).  \n \nInstitutional capacity of PIUs will also be strengthened by \ndesign and supervision consultants (DSCs). The staff of \nPIUs will include those from PHED, UEED and PWD, which  \nare already doing rehabilitation work. Their capabilities are \nlimited but in many respects the situation in J&K is not all \nthat  different  from  that  in  other  states  where  ADB  has \nprovided loans in India. They have all started with similar \nlimitations to those seen in the J&K agencies, but quickly \nthese  have  developed  the  capacity  to  successfully \nimplement their projects. This is indeed the track record \nfrom  many  ongoing  state  level  projects. Furthermore, in \nconsideration  of  this  limited  institutional  capacity,  the \nProject  has  been  designed  to  cover  only  simple  and \nstraightforward rehabilitation works. Subprojects calling for \nsignificant land acquisition, resettlement and environmental \nmeasures  (which  will  by  implication  require  extensive \nassessments upfront) have been excluded from the Project.  \n \nTo tighten the implementation further, and in particular to \nmove  the  Project  faster  towards  its  effectiveness  and \nultimate implementation stage, ADB intends to put in place \nthe equivalent of a transitional assistance. This assistance \nincludes  the  services  of  experienced  staff  consultants \nwhose mandate will be to provide special assistance to \nERA and PIUs until the Project-financed consultants are \nrecruited and come on stream.   \n \nAnother risk factor associated with the Project concerns \nsecurity measures during the implementation. This risk will \nbe addressed partially or in full by taking several measures.  \nThe use of local resources, including the use of a State-\nowned construction company on a force account basis for \nsmall works will go a long way to minimizing some of the \nproblems. The Project will allow contractors and consultants \nto  make  their  own  security  arrangements.  The security \nsituation may limit the ability of ADB staff in headquarters to \nmonitor the Project directly.  But the job can and should be \ndelegated  to  India  Resident  Mission  (INRM), which will \nestablish a project support unit (PSU) consisting of one \noversight  staff  consultant  based  at  INRM  and  two  staff \nconsultants based in J&K  - one for the urban component \nand the other for the road component. This team will be \ndedicated solely to the Project supervision and will move ", "ix   \ndedicated solely to the Project supervision and will move \nbetween Delhi, Jammu and Srinagar, as required, security \nconcerns permitting.  INRM senior staff will supervise and \nhave  responsibility  for  the  activities  of  the  PSU.  The \nobjective of this local team is to be on call and fully mobile \nin order to inform, guide and monitor actions taken on all \nfronts  by  ERA  and  PIUs,  especially  in  areas  related  to \nADB\u2019s policies and procedures. ADB security advisor will \nperiodically update general security situation in  J&K and \nprovide security advice from time to time to INRM and PSU. \nThis may entail rescheduling of the project monitoring and \nsupervision activities, such that project implementation will \nnot be affected. \n \nLack  of  counterpart  funding  is  a  common  cause  of \nimplementation delays for the State level projects.  In this \ncase, the central and state governments have committed to \nprovide the entire local counterpart funds  required during \nthe project implementation period.  \n \nAnother cause of delays is the time it takes to make land \nacquisitions  and  to  put  in  place  resettlement  plans, \nparticularly if both of these actions have to be carried out in \nline  with  ADB  operational  policies  and  procedures.  The \nProject  is  not  expected  to  encounter  problems  in  these \nareas.  The  eligibility  criteria  for  subprojects  specifically \nexclude from the financing subprojects with difficulties in \nthese areas.  ADB policies and procedures will be followed \nwhere any such requirements are needed.   ", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the purposes of the Multisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu \nand Kashmir. The report also describes a proposed technical assistance (TA) for preparing a \nJammu and Kashmir Urban Infrastructure Development Project. The TA will be financed by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom (UK) and will be administered by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.   Introduction \n2.  The economy of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K or the State) lags behind that of most other \nStates in India.  Investment has been constrained, mainly because of instability derived from the \nsecurity situation. Lower than average investment has impinged on employment, income and \ngrowth. There are also deep-seated structural problems, but in the scheme of problems, these \nrank lower in relation to growth, at least in the short term. And yet the State has interesting \neconomic and business possibilities. It has the ingredients of a landmark tourist destination, and \nits climate, location and traditions provide a good base for the development of a successful \nhorticultural and agricultural production/processing industry. \n \n3.  But  for  that  potential  to  be  tapped,  the  overall  socioeconomic  environment  needs \nmending. Confidence building also requires investment matched by visible and meaningful \nimprovements  to  the  physical  and  institutional  infrastructure,  including  better  basic  public \nservices. Jobs will come from these investments.   \n \n4.  The central Government and the State Governments have made a commitment to an \neconomic turnaround plan for J&K. In the first phase, this plan calls for investments to repair \nand/or upgrade priority parts of the existing infrastructure and public services network, including \nroads, bridges, power generation and distribution, water, wastewater, health and education.  At \na later stage, the investment plan will deepen the rehabilitation of existing facilities but also \ncreate new assets. The underlying objective is to make a real impact on the quality of life of \nlocal communities, but also to facilitate the mobility of people and trade, open the way to private \ninvestment over time and ultimately raise the level of prosperity to reduce poverty.   \n  \n5.  The central Government, and past  state governments in J&K developed reasonably \ngood infrastructure facilities and public services up to 1989. These were financed through the \npublic purse and their quality was generally on par with that of similar facilities in other parts of \nthe country, particularly in the case of roads, bridges and water services. However, unlike some \nother parts of the country, the quality of these assets has since deteriorated, mainly on account \nof limited financial allocations to cover maintenance and repairs.  A weak institutional capacity \nhas contributed to the problem. Some of the extra wear and tear is also a function of the specific \nphysical and climatic conditions in the area. The extent of deterioration varies between the \nassets and location. In general, it  can be concluded that the life span and quality of most \nfacilities  are  at  risk.  Unless  tackled  soon,  some  assets  may  need  to  be  completely \nreconstructed. This will not only be expensive, but also leave fewer funds free to target an \nexpansion of these facilities into areas currently with rather limited coverage. In the case of \nwater services, water losses are high (on account of a rundown secondary network) and service \nis erratic. Coverage is also an issue. The two main cities in the State (Jammu and Srinagar) ", "2  \nhave witnessed an influx of migrants over the years, putting extra pressure on the entire system. \nThis is also creating health and environmental hazards.  In road infrastructure, the problem is so \nsevere that many sections in the State actually need to be reconstructed from the sub-base.  \n \n6.  A study commissioned by ADB1 estimates investments for infrastructure rehabilitation \nand development in J&K to be in excess of $4 billion over the next several years. But such an \ninvestment plan would be beyond the financial capacity of J&K.  Its current capital investment \naccount stands at $400 million to $450 million a year.2 The State Government understands the \nconstraint but also the investments needed. During country programming in 2003, the central \nGovernment and ADB discussed the proposal in general terms. The subject was then taken up \nat a high level meeting in Manila in March 2004, where a specific agreement was reached \nbetween the two parties to consider a loan for the rehabilitation of selected infrastructure \nfacilities with understanding that the Project is to be prepared on a fast track basis but as a part \nof the normal lending operations. ADB has responded by putting together a team to carry out \ndue diligence on the proposals.  \n \nB.   Socioeconomic Features  \n7.  J&K is located in the northernmost part of India. Climatically, it is divided into three parts: \nsubtropical Jammu, temperate zone Kashmir Valley and arctic Ladakh. Administratively, it has \ntwo divisions: Jammu and Kashmir. The capital changes with the seasons\u2014Srinagar in the \nsummer and Jammu in winter (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n8.  The State has a unique status under Article 370 of the Constitution of India.  Unlike \nothers, it has residuary powers to promulgate its own constitution and laws covering political, \neconomic and social affairs.  \n \n9.   The population exceeds 10 million (2001 census) with a working age group growing \nrapidly  (currently  43%  of  the  population).  Unemployment  is  high.  Over  a  10-year period \n1990/2000 it increased by 48.8%. According to the 2001 census, the workforce comprised 3.7 \nmillion of which 68.8% were classified as \u201cworkers\u201d and 31.2% as \u201cmarginal workers\u201d (part time \nworkers).  Female  workers  comprise  28.4%  of  the  total  work  force,  of  which  66.8%  are \nconsidered as \u201cmarginal workers\u201d. The Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) rose from around \nRs55,000 million in 1994\u201395 to Rs141,210 million in 2001\u201302 (12.7% a year at current prices \nbut only 4.9% measured in real terms). This growth is attributed mainly to recurrent expenditure \non security. It is not driven by growth in productive sectors or trade. The recently approved 10th \nState Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) sets out a growth target of 6.3% a year.  Achieving and \nmaintaining this will depend on the level of investment put in place now. The proposed Project \nwill help the cause, but other investments are also needed.  \n \nC.   Urban Sector Overview  \n10.  One fourth of the population lives in urban areas, slightly below the national average \n(28%). Urban population growth between 1991-2001 reached 35%, much higher than in the \nrural sector (27%).  Extensive migration from rural to urban areas is the main reason, security \nconcerns being the main driver.  Jammu and Srinagar account for the largest share of the influx.  \nThis has put considerable pressure on the quality of all public services.   The State has initiated \na number of public works, but many could not be completed because of financial constraints \n                                                 \n1 Jammu and Kashmir Economy: Reform and Reconstruction by Haseeb A. Drabu, June 2004.  \n2 10th Five-Year Plan for the State. ", "3  \nand  security  problems.    Rehabilitation  of  the  existing  facilities  should  be  given  priorities, \nespecially the case in Srinagar and Jammu.  \n \n11.  Srinagar lies at an altitude of 1,600 meters (m) above mean sea level and has a \npopulation of 1.5 million. The River Jhelum flows through it. Large water bodies surround the \ncity, including the famous Dal and Nagin Lakes. The average annual rainfall is 1,200 millimeters \n(mm).  Raw water supply is not a problem, but treatment and distribution is.  The water system \nhas five partially interlinked subsystems, each with a surface water source, but all in a poor \nstate of repair.    In all the subsystems, water from the treatment plants is fed into the bulk \ntransmission system, flowing by gravity into a deteriorated distribution network.  The gravity \nmains from the five treatment plants enter the city along the road network.  The city has had to \naccommodate 200,000 migrants over the years.  The new migrants settled along this road \nsystem, tapping into the gravity mains for supply.  This has reduced greatly the quantity of water \nreaching core city areas, from five hours daily in the early 1990\u2019s to just one hour now.  \n \n12.  The State has tried to increase water production and treatment capacity.  However, the \nexisting transmission network is unable to carry an increased production. This is exacerbated by \nold and inefficient pumping machinery and dilapidated pipelines, leading to high leakage losses. \nThe service fails to meet minimum Indian standards. Drainage is also a major problem. Parts of \nthe city are lower than both the river and the Dal Lake. Dewatering pumps are worn out or \ndamaged and natural drains have not been maintained. Large-scale water logging is the result, \nespecially in low-lying areas, even during the dry season.  During the spring run off and the \nrainy season, these polluted bodies of water become a threat to public health.  The problem is \ncompounded by the lack of sewers. Night soil and septic tank effluents are discharged into open \nstreet drains, resulting in contamination and blockages, particularly in the older areas with high \npopulation density.  Sewerage is not included in this initial Project because of the need to first \nhave a comprehensive master plan, detailed environmental impact assessments and land \nacquisition, which will require considerable work before construction can begin.  \n \n13.  Jammu has a population of 1.26 million and undulating terrain ranging from an elevation \nof 290 m to 450 m above mean sea level. The average annual rainfall is 1,000 mm. The River \nTawi flows through it.  Water supply comes from 130 tubewells adjacent to the River Tawi. \nThese account for 70% of the supply.  The rest comes from the River Tawi.   Water is treated at \ntwo plants at Sitlee and pumped to two large ground level reservoirs at Chinore and Manda.  \n \n14.  The water supply system in Jammu also suffers from aging equipment and poor pipes, \nleading to high losses, inequity in distribution especially in higher elevations and at the end of \nthe system, including the migrant population in the center and outlying areas. Supply varies \nbetween 25 to 300 liters per capita per day (lpcd).  The outlying areas had been serviced by \ntube well based piped water service, but groundwater has almost been dried up.  The city was \nplanned to grow in a southerly direction.  However, most of the migrants settled in the west \n(land was cheaper).  This area is far from existing water sources.  Integration with the Jammu \nnetwork is difficult. Water is being supplied through tankers.  As in Srinagar, the general state of \nrepair of water facilities is poor.   Expenditures on operations and maintenance (O&M) stand at \nless than 1% of asset value.  The national average is closer to 4%.  Drainage is also a problem.  \nLack  of  maintenance  of  both  natural  and  constructed  channels  is  a  contributing  factor, \naggravated by the accumulation of municipal solid waste dumped indiscriminately into the \ndrains.  Recurring flooding is standard, a clear risk to public health.   There is no piped \nsewerage system in any part of the city.  Wastewater is disposed by septic tanks with discharge \ninto open drains. A sewerage master plan has been prepared but the works require  $264 \nmillion. Only a small part of this plan has been implemented.  ", "4  \n15.  The  State  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  is  responsible  for  water \nsupply.  The State Urban Environmental Engineering Department (UEED) deals with sewerage \nand drainage.  The State is looking into a number of reforms for both services in Jammu and \nSrinagar.  Devolution of the management and maintenance responsibilities are likely to be part \nof this change agenda.  The reform will be defined over the next 12 months.  While practices of \nthese  agencies  have  not  yet  been  fully  in  compliance  with  ADB's  Water  Policy3  (see \nSupplementary Appendix X), they are moving toward that direction by initiating the process of \nreform under the piggy backed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the follow-on \nurban infrastructure development project.   On the planning front,  PHED and UEED have \nalready developed master plans for water supply, sewerage and drainage.  These are an \nimportant start, but some updating and improvements are needed, especially to accommodate \ninvestments in new assets.  A tentative investment plan has been prepared amounting to  $ 700 \nmillion over the medium to long term.  Clearly, this plan needs to be stripped into manageable \npackages,  matching  priorities  against  the  financial  reality  of  local  government  and  the \naffordability or payment capacity of end-users.   \n   \nD.   Transport Sector Overview  \n \n16.  The State itself has an extensive roads network totaling 29,041 kilometers (km), of which \n823 km are national highways. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and National \nHighways Authority of India (NHAI) look after this subsector, while their maintenance is handled \nby the Border Roads Organization. The State Public Works Department (PWD), Road and \nBridge Division, deals with state roads, major district roads, and \"other district\" roads, the latter \nbeing rural roads in nature. PWD is responsible for 14,858 km, of which 5,082 km are in the \nJammu region, 7,984 km in the Kashmir region, and 1,792 km in Ladakh. Of the total, 12,109 \nkm is surfaced, either black topped, metalled, or shingled, but 2,749 km are unsurfaced, with no \ncover  for  all  weather  access.  The  Project  will  cover  only  road  systems  falling  under  the \njurisdiction of PWD. \n \n17.  The  Forest  Department  and  Rural  Development  Departments  also  cover  road \ndevelopment and maintenance work.  Their network covers 13,660 km, of which 1,901 km are \nsurfaced  and  11,759  km  are  unsurfaced.    The  major  arterial  urban  roads  fall  under  the \njurisdiction of the PWD.  Municipal corporations look after the remaining parts of the network.  \n \n18.  The network has deteriorated in quality and coverage over the past 15 years.  This has \naffected both roads and bridges alike due to limited funding for rehabilitation and maintenance, \ncoupled with the security situation.  A number of state highways and district/rural roads are \nsimply not passable during the rainy season.  Many bridges are in very poor condition - a large \nnumber being accessible only to light vehicles and pedestrian traffic. There are missing links \nacross rivers, traffic movement here taking place only over the riverbed during the dry season.  \nThe system also suffers from frequent landslides, difficult terrain and soil conditions, a short \nworking season and the effects of severe winters.  Roads in the higher altitude areas are \naffected by snowfall during January-March. At the onset of the summer season starting in April, \nsnow  melts  and  water  ingresses  into  pavement  layers  through  cracks,  causing  additional \ndamage.  Despite these constraints/conditions, during 1989\u20132000 road traffic increased more \nthan 2\u00bd times.  This has resulted in congestions at certain key junctions.   \n \n19.  The State has put in place several road improvement programs in the past, most funded \nthrough the central government budget.  One of most important programs is the four laning of \n                                                 \n3 ADB, 2001, Water for All \u2013The Water Policy of the ADB, Manila. ", "5  \nthe national highway between Jammu and Srinagar and the Srinagar bypass, an investment \nspearheaded under the National Highways Development Project (NHDP).  The rural road \nnetworks are also being upgraded under the Prime Minister's Rural Road Program.  Rural \ninfrastructure  has  obtained  support  from  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  (NABARD).  The  NABARD  assistance  received  by  PWD  under  the  Rural \nInfrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) focuses on roads in rural areas. While the J&K also \nreceives funds for state highways from the Central Road Fund (CRF), these funds are far from \nadequate. These indicate that state and district roads are the segments that have the least \naccess to funds from the Central Government for their development. \n \n20.  O&M is a critical element for securing the sustainability of the state road network, \nhowever, PWD has not received adequate funds from the State Government for maintenance. \nWhile an amount of $52 million is required per year for O&M, PWD has been receiving only \nabout $7 million. O&M is an institutional issue requiring a system wide approach (see para 92).  \n \n21.  The local construction industry is relatively small. Business is fragmented and shared by \nsmall operators.  An exception to this is Jammu and Kashmir Projects Construction Corporation \nLtd. (J&KPCC), a 100% state owned company.  J&KPCC has been responsible for bridge works \nat J&K for years.   It has the capacity and equipment to carry out significant works on bridges, \nincluding those in the less accessible areas.  The alternatives are certainly limited.    \n \n22.  The 10th Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) includes a relatively simple road development \nplan, which stresses the importance of (i) expanding urban road networks to cope with the \nexpansion of urban areas, particularly in Srinagar and Jammu and (ii) reconstructing damaged \nbridges (237 in total). In the wake of the general election in May 2004, rural roads have now \nbeen given a much higher priority than hitherto.  Another priority includes the widening of roads \nserving the principal tourist spots.   \n \nE.   External Assistance \n \n23.  ADB operations in the urban sector in India started in 1995. Since then, 8 loans have \nbeen approved - Karnataka (2 loans), Rajasthan, Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh, housing finance (2 \nloans) and the earthquake emergency loan to Gujarat, which is mostly urban in nature - with a \ntotal loan amount of $2.1 billion. There are 6 more loans to the urban sector in the pipeline, \nthree of which are under an early stage of preparation  (see Supplementary Appendix B for \nexternal assistance).  Road sector operations started in 1988.  Since then, ADB has approved \n12 loans, totaling $2.8 billion. ADB\u2019s role has been stepped up since the operationalization of \nNHAI  in1995.    Between  2000\u20132003,  ADB  provided  four  loans  to  NHAI,  and  is  currently \npreparing another one for 2004.  At the state level, a road operation started in 2002 to Madhya \nPradesh,  followed  by  another  in  2003  to  Chhattishgarh.  In  the  last  couple  of  years,  the \nDepartment of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, has steered ADB towards the \nsmaller and less developed states, including the North Eastern states, the recently created \nstates of Chhattishgarh and Uttaranchal, and now to J&K. Rural roads are now another priority.  \nThe first rural road project was approved in 2003 and a second is currently under preparation. \nThe pipeline for 2005-2007 includes eight loans for the road sector. \n \n24.  The World Bank has provided four loans to the urban sector, although none as a stand \nalone or direct to J&K.  The value of these loans is $0.4 billion.  Water supply and sanitation are \nthe main targets of these loans. The road sector occupies a larger share of the World Bank\u2019s \nlending program. It  has provided 19 loans to date, amounting to about $4.5 billion, mainly \ntargeting the upgrading of national highways, improvement of state highways and construction ", "6  \nand rehabilitation of rural roads.  ADB and the World Bank have agreed a coordinated strategy \nin 2001 for the road sector. This is updated from time to time to blend lending with the \nGovernment\u2019s  own  development  and  financing  agenda.  Both  banks  hold  regular  tripartite \nmeetings with the Government on these issues.  \n \n25.  Bilateral agencies also work in both the urban and road sectors in India.  The most \nactive are those agencies from Germany, France, Scandinavia, Japan, Netherlands, UK and the \nUnited States.  None have worked in J&K before.  Their combined assistance, loan and grant, \namount to $1.6 billion.  Their involvement in the road sector has been muted. For instance, JBIC \nprovided $300 million to the road sector over recent years, but has not been too active lately. \nThis situation might change, although it will be quite selective, probably with a focus on bridges.  \nThe Government of the United Kingdom has supported ADB programs extensively through the \nfinancing of technical assistance. Urban and road projects have benefited from this finance.  \nIndeed, in the context of this Project, the Government of the United Kingdom has agreed to \nfinance a PPTA to help prepare an Urban Infrastructure Development Project4.    \n \nF.  Lessons Learned  \n \n26.  Main  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  urban,  transport  and  emergency  projects  are \nsummarized below.   \n   \n(i)  Delays  in  setting  up  project  management  units  (PMUs)  and/or  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) have resulted in implementation delays of up to 6 \nmonths or more.  PMUs/PIUs need experienced experts for at least 3-4 years. \nContinuity and experience contribute to success.  The Government is now taking \na position that PMUs should be established before loan negotiations;  \n \n(ii)  Delays in the engagement of project management consultants (PMCs) affect \nimplementation. This process can often take between 12\u201318 months, after the \nPMUs/PIUs  are  established.    Advance  actions  are  needed.  Some  of  ADB \npractices could also be made more efficient.  \n \n(iii)  Counterpart  funding  requirements  must  be  clearly  agreed  upon  during \nprocessing, and during each succeeding year of implementation.  \n \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s Standard Bidding Documents should be followed not only for international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) but also for local competitive bidding (LCB). PMUs \noften prefer to work with their own documentation.  Making the conversion to \nADB\u2019s formats takes time.  \n \n(v)  Implementation benefits from the issuance of an operational manual during the \npreparatory  stage.  This  defines  the  role  of  each  entity  and  outlines  their \nappropriate  decision-making  and  delegation  powers.  Clarity  saves  time  and \nmoney. It also enhances transparency and efficiency.  \n \n(vi)  Advance actions on procurement and engagement of consultants need the right \ncapacity at the level of the PMUs, especially to prepare bidding documents and \nrequests for proposal.  Good early support to these is necessary to avoid delays.  \n                                                 \n4 ADB received a written confirmation from DFID on 26 October 2004 for allocation of the funds. ", "7  \nThe use of staff consultants to bridge the gap between project appraisal and loan \neffectiveness has been effective.  \n \nG.   Government Policy  \n \n27.  The 10th Five-Year Plan of the Government of India sets forth a comprehensive policy \nagenda for 2002\u20132007.  This emphasizes, among others: (i) rehabilitation and expansion of \ninfrastructure; (ii) reduction of regional economic disparities; (iii) delivering greater economic \nefficiency through more competitive infrastructure development and improved O&M; and (iv) \nroad safety, energy efficiency and environmental conservation.  Following the 2004 General \nElection, the new Government has also adopted a Common Minimum Program (CMP), placing \nemphasis on rural development, as well as on the improvement of basic public services. The \nlatter includes roads, water supply, sewage treatment and sanitation.  The Program also calls \nfor the execution of growth-driven plans in J&K.  Infrastructure development lies at the core of \nthese proposals. The proposed Project fits into the CMP framework.  \n \nH.   ADB Strategy  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s core mandate is poverty reduction. The 2003 Country Strategy and Program \n(CSP) for India sets out three strategic themes around this: pro-poor growth, social development \nand governance.  The 2004 CSP Update (CSPU) also highlights interventions in the poorer \nstates, including Northeast states, Uttaranchal and J&K.  Infrastructure is one of the vehicles to \nachieve these goals. \n \n29.  ADB assistance to J&K will be provided in a programmatic manner, starting with this \nProject, but followed by three subsequent and sequenced sector specific investments, subject to \nBoard approvals, covering urban, road and power needs.  Each future project will include a \npreparation facility in the form of a piggy-backed TA to prepare the next subsequent project.  In \nthis manner, ADB will offer India not only critical mass but also selectivity and continuity, all \ningredients for success.  The first of these follow-up projects will, subject to Board approval, \ntake place in 2006.  \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.   Rationale and Approach \n \n30.  The proposed Project is a first input5 into a longer-term endeavor to rehabilitate and later \nexpand the coverage of the water, drainage and roads/bridges networks across the State.    \nAlthough J&K has substantial rehabilitation and new asset creation needs, this Project is \nconfined to priority rehabilitation needs.  Rehabilitation works are expected to add years to the \nlife span of existing facilities.  Rehabilitation will also reduce budget outlays for maintenance, by \ndefinition freeing funds for other purposes.  Unless arrested now, the deterioration of these \nexisting assets will get to the point where the only way forward will be their total reconstruction \nfrom scratch.  That would be expensive and also disruptive.   \n \n                                                 \n5  The first intervention from a multilateral was under a Social Forestry Project in Haryana and J&K in 1982/83 (the \nWorld Bank). The loan amount was $23 million. A second intervention was again the World Bank Project for the \ndevelopment of an Integrated Watershed in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and J&K, in 1992 ($125 million). \nThese are multi-state projects, but not a J&K specific assistance. The proposed Project is the first stand-alone \nproject in J&K with funding from a multilateral.   ", "8  \n31.  The  State  has  little  experience  in  implementing  large  externally  financed  projects.  \nPutting in place too many investments at one go would exert pressure on this capacity and raise \nthe risk profile of the entire ADB intervention.  Narrowing the coverage of the Project to only two \nsectors and limiting this further to straight rehabilitation, help contain risk.  It also gives ADB a \nchance to develop a closer working relationship with the State, and to start the process of \ncapacity building for staff of key line departments.  Most states in India have adapted and/or \nadopted fast-track ADB procedures.   J&K should be no exception, even allowing for the more \ndifficult conditions on the ground.  Starting slowly with a narrow focus and straightforward jobs \n(even if the financing plan is large) provides a chance to get things right. A matrix of tasks \nversus risks has been considered too in terms of the funding allocations. Roads/bridges are \nsimpler to deal with so they were accorded the higher share of the financing.  Urban works are \nmore complex and need greater capacity on the ground in order to cut risks.  The PMUs/PIUs \nwill be given time to learn and get ready, both via the transitional assistance being considered \nprior to loan effectiveness and through the more structured and longer-term support planned at \nthe implementation stage. The team has also taken into account the availability and experience \nof potential contractors. For the road sector and the type of works envisaged, there would be a \nrelatively large number of contractors.  In the urban field the number of specialized contractors \nis fewer.  \n \n32.  The decision to tap multilateral finance to rehabilitate key infrastructure facilities and \nservices  at  this  stage  is  being  accompanied  by  the  creation  of  a  new  institutional\u2013cum\u2013\neconomic coordination body within the structure of the State Government  - the Economic \nReconstruction  Agency  or  ERA  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The  State  Government \napproved the establishment of ERA in July 2004, basically to deal with the proposed Project, but \nalso to plan ahead. The establishment of this nodal agency provides an opportunity to ring fence \nproject implementation work while working on broader capacity, governance and policy needs.  \nERA will operate on both fronts, using this first project to develop its own in-house capabilities. \nThe same applies to the PIUs.  While the Project targets rehabilitation, it also earmarks money \nand time to improving capacity at the State Government.   \n \nB.   Objectives \n \n33.  The Project targets the rehabilitation of essential infrastructure in J&K.  Water supply \nand drainage system improvement will raise the quality of life of the urban populations in \nSrinagar and Jammu. Road and bridge financing will improve rural connectivity and facilitate \ntrade within the State. The Project also targets capacity building of ERA, which will lead to better \nplanning,  improved  policy  formulation  and  the  introduction  of  more  reliable  project \nimplementation skills, systems and criteria. Capacity measures will improve transparency and \nefficiency.    The  underlying  objective  is  to  underpin  an  economic  turnaround.  The  Project \nFramework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.   Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Urban Sector Component  \n34.  This component addresses the most immediate rehabilitation needs of the water and \ndrainage systems in J&K.  Total investment requirements for this purpose have been estimated \nby the State at around $700 million.  Although this need is real, capacity concerns, narrowed \ndown this first ADB intervention to works in the most badly affected parts of the system/network \nas described below (see Appendix 3 for details): \n ", "9  \n(i)  Water Supply Rehabilitation in Kashmir. Includes the replacement of dilapidated \nwater supply transmission lines, upgrading of old/damaged pumping machinery \nand provision of standby generators and power supply protection equipment. \n(ii)  Drainage Rehabilitation in Kashmir.  Includes the extension of drainage systems \nin selected areas including Bemina, a heavily waterlogged sector of the city. \nWorks will also include the rehabilitation of pump stations and unclogging of \ndrains, and equipment/vehicles for garbage collection (drain cleaning purposes).  \n(iii)  Water  Supply  Rehabilitation  in  Jammu.  Includes  rehabilitation  of  damaged \nnetworks and facilities, pipes, pumps and standby generators, and includes a low \ncost sanitation system for selected migrant areas.  \n(iv)  Drainage  Rehabilitation  in  Jammu.  Includes  restoration  of  drains  linings, \nwidening and re-grading, and equipment and vehicles for garbage collection for \ndrain cleaning. \n35.  The ADB team worked with the State on the appraisal of two sample subprojects under \nthis component.   The objective was to appraise the subprojects according to ADB\u2019s procedures, \nbut also to show to counterpart staff the approaches and procedures to subproject selection.  \nThe first sample subproject covers the rehabilitation of water supply infrastructure in Jammu.  \nThis part of the system serves approximately 530,000 people, of which 180,000 are migrants. \nThe cost of the subproject is estimated at $7.9 million. The second subproject deals with the \nrehabilitation of drainage infrastructure in the Talab Tillo area of Jammu. Its cost is estimated at \n$2.1 million.  It will benefit 68,000 people (by reducing flooding and public health risks).  The \nappraisal of these two sample subprojects found them to be implementable and viable in terms \nof technical, economic, environmental and social criteria (Supplementary Appendixes I and J for \nsummary appraisal reports). Future investments or subprojects will be identified and studied in \nline  with  the  Eligibility  Criteria  and  Procedures  Framework  and  the  Frameworks  for \nResettlement, Environmental Assessment, and Indigenous People Development (Appendices 2 \nand 10 and Supplementary Appendixes D and E).  \n \n36.   The  Project  includes  a  PPTA  grant  administered  by  ADB  to  help  prepare  a  more \ncomprehensive  investment  in  2006  on  water  supply,  sewerage,  drainage  and  solid waste \nmanagement. In line with both ADB\u2019s and India\u2019s water policies,6 the PPTA will address sector \nplans, policy and institutional issues to promote cost recovery through tariff reforms. Water \nconservation and sustainability will be part of the mandate.  The efficiency of service delivery \nwill also be considered.  The follow-on project, if approved by ADB\u2019s Board, is expected to focus \non coverage, quality and continuity.  In this sense, new assets are expected to expand coverage \nto areas not serviced at present.  O&M and investment cost recovery will imply a modified tariff \nstructure and new rates.  Metering will also be part of the investment.  In addition, the PPTA will \nwork on a non-revenue water program to reduce both the administrative and physical losses \nthroughout the water system, in this manner carrying forward the work under this first Project.  \nThe State has already agreed to double tariffs on all connections under this Project but further \nanalysis of the O&M needs and revenue streams have to be carried out.  Efficiency measures \nare also needed in the commercial part of the business, especially billing and fee collection.  \nOther forms include administration and the computerization of records, tax rolls, water user lists, \naccounting, audits, establishment of O&M budgeting and budgets and training on O&M.  A \n                                                 \n6 ADB, 2001, Water for All \u2013 The Water Policy of ADB.  India's water policy was developed in 1992, which was \nupdated in 2002. ", "1 0 \nsewerage fee/tariff will also be needed. The PPTA will help address all these issues. The \nproposed Project itself cannot address them at one go and upfront.  The quality of the service is \nsimply too poor to encourage end-users to pay much higher fees than at present.  The Project \nwill provide the basis for working on these reforms.  It will also allow ADB and local government \nto improve public awareness, community participation and education, basically to broadcast the \nmessage that water will no longer be free, but that as an economic good with value, it needs to \npaid for through fair and transparent tariff regimes and metering systems.   \n \n2.   Transport Sector Component  \n37.  PWD requested ADB to finance transport sector investments amounting to $640 million.    \nIn common with the urban component, this amount falls outside the institutional and financial \ncapacity of the State. For this reason, it was agreed to narrow the scope and coverage of the \ncomponent to the most urgent rehabilitation needs.   The Project will focus on existing roads \nand bridges in a poor state of repair in 14 major districts.  ADB and the State Government will \nconsider a broader sector project at a later stage. ERA agrees with this strategy.  The narrow \nscope of the Project now will still make the investments meaningful and relevant to local \ncommunities. The rehabilitation process will help with trade and personal mobility (Appendix 4).     \n \n38.  Potential subprojects include the rehabilitation/reconstruction of about 80 damaged and \nweak bridges, and the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 1,500 km of roads which fall under \nthe jurisdiction of PWD, and which include state, urban, major district, \"other district\" and village \nroads.  The priority project list provided by the State Government in September 2004 indicates \nthat around 40% of the roads to be rehabilitated are village roads, 30% fall under the category \nof \"other district roads\", 12% are urban roads, 8% are major district roads, and 10% are other \nmiscellaneous roads.  In each case, the road segments will properly be planned to ensure \nconnectivity with the greater road network.  The average cost of road subprojects is about $1.5 \nmillion, while that of a typical bridge is $0.5 million. The Project will also fund the procurement of \nequipment required for the maintenance management system.  \n \n39.   To  demonstrate  how  transport  subcomponents  will  be  appraised,  three  sample \nsubprojects were used by the Project team: (i) Quazikund-Kulgam road with a length of 16.5 km \nin Ananthnag district; (ii) Raithan-Palmaidan-Arizol road with a length of 14.1 km in Budgam \ndistrict; and (iii) Kannikadal bridge of a total length of 31m in Srinagar. These subprojects are \nconsidered  to  be  representative  of  others  expected  in  the  future  under  the  Project.  The \nQuazikund-Kulgam road sample subproject calls for the repair and widening of an existing \nsingle lane carriageway to one and half lane standard with the improvement/construction of \npaved shoulders and roadside drainage. The project cost is estimated to be $3.4 million.  The \nRaithan-Palmaidan-Arizol road sample subproject involves the simple upgrading from gravel to \na paved road, but with the same single lane standard, together with construction of paved \nshoulders and roadside drainage. The cost is estimated to be $2.2 million. Adequate road safety \nmeasures will be provided for both cases through the construction of guardrails on a raised \nfootpath to separate roadside settlements from the main carriageway. The Kannikadal bridge \nsample  subproject  is  the  upgrading  of  a  bridge  from  the  current  timber  structure  into  a \npermanent solid structure, albeit with the same two lane carriageway, but with a minor widening \nfor a pedestrian footpath along the bridge. Its cost is estimated at $0.3 million. ADB appraised \nthe three sample subprojects and found them to be technically and economically viable.  The \nteam subjected each of the samples to detailed due diligence on economic, environmental and \nsocial aspects.  The results of the appraisals were used to create a standard appraisal format \nfor  later  use  in  appraising  follow-on  subprojects  (Supplementary  Appendices  I  and  J).  \nAdditional subprojects will be identified and implemented in accordance with the Eligibility ", "11  \nCriteria and Procedures and Frameworks for Resettlement, Environmental Assessment, and \nIndigenous People Development (Appendixes 2, 10, and Supplementary Appendixes D and E). \n \n3.   Capacity Building  \n40.  The Project is the first direct intervention of its kind by a multilateral in J&K (footnote 5).  \nThis leads to a concern  about the institutional capability of ERA and PIUs which have little \nexperience in implementing externally funded projects (Supplementary Appendices T and U). \nThis is not an insurmountable problem, but most of ADB\u2019s procedures are unfamiliar to the state \nline agencies.  Procurement, documentation, reporting and safeguards are only some of the \nareas where this unfamiliarity takes place.  The second concern relates to the size of the \ninvestment which, although quite small by India standards, is still considerable. This requires \ngreater care and attention on the coordination and sequencing front. J&K is not new to the world \nof civil works contracts, or to operations implemented in various sectors at the same time across \nthe State.  But in this case, the transaction does not mean it will cancel out all others normally \nundertaken by the State. The operation is over and above those normally carried out by the \nlocal administration. It replaces some works, but it is not the total or complete universe of all the \ncivil works. This scenario suggests extra pressures on the existing organizational set up and line \nagency systems.  \n \n41.  The Project team has paid special attention to institutional base and capacity building.  \nIn doing so, the team focused on two parts of the equation. The first deals with the broad \nstructures of state government, and in particular, with the coordination of the global economic \nplan and sequencing of investments. The second addresses the needs of the Project itself.  The \ntwo tasks require specific measures to ensure quality, coherence and efficiency.  There is in \nparticular a need to link them. There is also a need for continuity. This Project is only a first \nstage of a larger economic turnaround program.  As such, the measures put in place today have \nto stand the test of time, and ensure coherence between these and other investments tomorrow.  \nThe priority here is the training of a few but qualified staff of ERA and line departments. The \nunderstanding with the authorities is that this staff will be retained in PMU/PIUs for a reasonable \nperiod of time on a fixed-term or permanent basis. \n \n42.  The capacity building  component  has  two  main  modules:  (i)  project  management \nsupport to be provided by the project management consultant (PMC) and (ii) design/supervision \nsupport to be provided by the design supervision consultants (DSCs). \n \n(i)  Project management support module. \n \n(a)  Operational support including: appraisal of subprojects; due diligence for \nall aspects of subprojects including ADB's safeguard policies; review and \nauthorization  of  subproject  designs;  review  and  endorsement  of \nprocurement decisions; endorsement of design as you build and force \naccount contracts; and overall monitoring including financial and non-\nfinancial  audits,  other  warranties  and  representations  given  to  ADB \n(Supplementary Appendix G).  \n \n(b)   Training    covering  all  aspects  related  to  the  project  cycle,  including: \npreparation  and  appraisal,  due  diligence  and  execution  of  safeguard \npolicies,  consultant  selection,  procurement  and  financial  management \nincluding disbursement and project accounts/audits.  \n ", "1 2 \n(c)   Policy  and  planning  advice  including:  master  plans  for  water  supply, \nsewerage,  drainage  and  solid  waste  management  for  Jammu  and \nKashmir;  a cost recovery study for water including tariff review, tariff \nregime,  metering  system,  billing  and  fee  collection,  O&M  needs  and \napproaches; a sustainability study on road O&M, including a review of \ncurrent  O&M  structure,  O&M  systems  such  as  contracting  out  and \ncommunity based O&M, establishment of road funds and other funding \nmethods; specific support to PWD to set up a road maintenance system, \nincluding a road maintenance model, a road condition database, and the \ndevelopment and scheduling of maintenance programs; and updating of \nsector development plans to make up for the gaps encountered at this \nstage and ensure compliance with ADB policies.  \n \n(ii)  Design/supervision support module. \n \n(a)   Operational  support  to  PIUs  for:  preparation  of  subprojects  including \nfeasibility studies, environmental impact assessments, resettlement plans \nand  other  pertinent  safeguard  work  in  line  with  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures; preparation of preliminary and detailed designs; preparation \nof  bidding  documents  and  evaluation  of  bids;  and  construction \nsupervision including checking of adherence to safeguard arrangements.   \n \n(b)   Training for: feasibility studies preparation (backed by due diligence work \non  technical  and  economic/financial  aspects  required  by  ADB); \npreliminary  and  detailed  designs;  safeguards  work  including \nenvironmental assessments, poverty assessments, land acquisition and \nresettlement  plans,  indigenous  people  development  plans,  gender \nassessments, community participation in planning and implementation of \nworks; procurement and bid evaluation; and best practices related to \nengineering design, quality assurance and O&M.   \n     \nD.   Special Features \n \n1.   Structure \n \n43.  Because  of  special  circumstances  faced  by  the  Project  team,  the  Project  has \nincorporated several unique features. A first consideration was the method of processing the \nloan.  In  order  to  be  responsive  to  the  Government  request  for  urgent  infrastructure \nrehabilitation, covering multiple sectors, the Project could not be processed as either a standard \nproject loan or a standard sector loan.7 The Project followed procedure similar to a sector loan \nwith some innovation as described below.   \n \n(i)  The Project focuses on supporting ERA established as the key nodal agency \nspecialized in handling externally aided projects for the State, and instituting an \ninstitutional arrangement for systematic development and management of those \nprojects, instead of developing detailed sector plans and policies. The support of \nERA is viewed as a key initial institutional policy dialogue that will assist the State \nin developing sector policies.   \n                                                 \n7 ADB recognizes that approaches in specific projects may require a \"hybrid\" approach. See, for example, OM \nSection F2/OP, para 40. ", "13  \n \n(ii)  The eligibility criteria for subprojects have been defined, which confines the types \nof the subprojects to be financed under the Project to those investments for \nrehabilitation with no major environmental and resettlement being involved.  \n \n(iii)  Necessary  frameworks  for  environmental  assessment,  resettlement  and \nindigenous people development have been developed to ensure the compliance \nof ADB's safeguard policies.  \n \n(iv)  To demonstrate how subprojects are to be appraised, five sample subprojects \nhave been selected and fully appraised with development of a standard summary \nformat for subproject appraisal. \n \n(v)  The remaining subprojects will be developed in accordance with these criteria \nand appraised by the nodal agency, which will then be approved by ADB to \nensure the compliance with ADB's policy and procedural requirements. \n \n44.  Another feature of the structure is the adoption of a design-as-you-build concept for the \nroad/bridge component. The latter consists of a large number of subprojects (100 for roads and \n80 for bridge) scattered over 14 districts. Under the design-as-you-build concept, contractors will \ndesign one section of a contract package followed by its construction. These contractors will \nthen move successively onto the next sections, repeating the same process until the entire \ncontract package is completed. Each contract will be packaged on a district by district basis.  \nAlthough limited in scope (less than $10 million in total), ADB also proposes the introduction of a \nforce account procedure for the rehabilitation of smaller bridges with works valued at less than \n$0.5 million. These two types of contracts require good supervision, particularly with regard to \ndesign and cost estimate/verification.  For this reason, the Project has incorporated a two-tier \nreviewing system.  The DSCs will examine  and approve traffic forecasts, project costs and \ndesign aspects. These reviews would then be further checked by the PMC, looking in design \nstandards,  administration  matters,  sequencing,  safeguard  policies,  competition  and \ntransparency.  \n \n2.   Implementation \n45.  Implementation ranks first among the various potential risks.  It is only natural that this \naspect should receive the greatest level of attention from the State and ADB.  Past experience \nindicates that direct and focused support on a regular basis is helpful when dealing with less \nexperienced executing agencies and PIUs. The support should not start only after project \neffectiveness. It should do so between project approval and effectiveness.  For this purpose, \nADB intends to engage a team of staff consultants through its administrative budget (under a \ntransitional assistance) to provide immediate support after project approval and until loan \neffectiveness  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  F  for  outline  TOR).  The  key  task  under  this \ntransition assistance will be to take advance actions for the engagement of a PMC and DSCs.  \nThe team of these staff consultants will also work with ERA staff on putting together operational \nmanuals, assist with the establishment of the PMU and PIUs, and provide training to the staff of \nPMU and PIUs. Once the loan becomes effective, ERA will be in a position to kick-start the \nProject, by this time already supported by PMC.  This will pave the way for the work and \nassistance to be provided through the DSCs and the PMC. This type of transitional assistance \ncan save 12\u201318 months in the project implementation cycle.  \n ", "1 4 \n46.  Furthermore, once the Project becomes effective, the India Resident Mission (INRM) will \nset up a mobile project support unit (PSU) specializing in the supervision of the Project. The \nlatter will consist of one oversight staff consultant based at INRM and two staff consultants \nbased in J&K- one for the Urban Sector Component and the other for the Transport Sector \nComponent. They will report to senior staff at INRM. These experts will stay with the Project \nuntil its implementation is completed.  \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n \n47.  The total Project cost is estimated at $358.0 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties, of which $167.0 million (46.7%) represents foreign exchange costs, including $23.4 \nmillion of interest during construction and other charges, and $191.0 million (53.3%) represents \nlocal currency costs. A summary cost estimate is given in Table 1, with more details shown in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n  Table 1: Cost Estimates  \n   \n  ($ million) \n \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total \n \nExchangeCurrency \n \n1.Component A: Rehabilitation of Urban Infrastructure \n \n    Rehabilitation of Water Supply  39.2 34.8 73.9\n    Rehabilitation and Improvements of Drainage Systems  12.3 20.9 33.2\n  2.Component B: Rehabilitation of Roads and Bridges  91.5 72.9 164.5\n  3.Component  C:  Capacity  Building  Support  and      \n  Implementation Assistance \n \n  Project Management Support  0.6 5.0 5.6\n \n    Design and Construction Supervision Support   0.0 8.7 8.7\n    Training for capacity building  0.0 0.9 0.9\n    Incremental Administration, Equipment and Vehicles  0.0 5.0 5.0\n  4.Interest During Construction and Commitment Charges  23.4 0.0 23.4\n  5.Taxes and Duties  0.0 42.8 42.8\n \nTotal   167.0 191.0 358.0\n \nSource:  staff estimates. \nNote:  Figures may not add up to totals due to rounding.  \n              Contingencies are not included  \n \nF.  Financing Plan  \n \n48.  ADB will provide a loan of $250.0 million from its ordinary capital resources. This \nrepresents 70% of the financing plan.  The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment fee of 0.75% per annum.  No \nfront-end fee will be charged in line with current financial terms and conditions. Other standard \nterms and conditions are set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Borrower will \nbe India, which will transfer the funds under standard terms and conditions to J&K. The \nBorrower will bear the foreign exchange risk. The Borrower has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Borrower\u2019s own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n ", "15  \n49.  ADB will cover $143.6 million of the foreign exchange component of the Project and \n$106.4  million  of  local  cost  contracts.  The  latter  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  vehicles, \nconsulting  services,  and  administrative  support  but  exclude  land,  taxes  and  duties.  The \nGovernment of India will finance out of its own resources $23.4 million equivalent to meet the \ncost of interest during construction and other charges.   \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  ExchangeCurrency  Total %\nAsian Development Bank      143.6  106.4 250.0 70\nThe Government of India / Government of Jammu and     23.4 a   84.6 108.0 30\nKashmir \nTotal      167.0  191.0 358.0 100\n      a Interest during construction and commitment charges. \n    Source:  staff estimates. \n \n50.  About 10% of the ADB loan proceeds will be converted by India into a rupee loan at a \nrate to be determined by the Government from time to time (currently 9% per annum). The \nremaining 90% of the proceeds will be converted and provided on a grant basis to the State.  \nThe Government and State Government have committed to provide the required counterpart \nfunds on a timely basis.8 All the foreign exchange risk associated with the borrowing from ADB \nwill be borne by India. The Government of India will provide the required funds directly to ERA \non time in line with the Project implementation schedule. The Project will not replace funding to \nother sectors. It will be incremental. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n51.  The State Government and ERA will have joint responsibility as Executing Agencies (EAs) \nfor  the  execution  of  the  Project.  The  State  Government  will  have  overall  coordination \nresponsibility  for  ensuring  the  participation  and  performance  by  its  departments  of  their \nresponsibilities under the Project. ERA will have overall Project execution and coordination \nresponsibility  and  will  also  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  assistance  provided  by \nmultilaterals. The State Government will ensure that ERA has all delegated and other powers \nnecessary to carry out its responsibilities as EA. ERA staff will also be engaged on a permanent \nor fixed-term basis to look after the management of externally aided projects.  \n \n52.  ERA will establish a PMU to manage the Project. This PMU will be headed by a project \ndirector (which will be the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ERA since ERA and PMU would be \nidentical in structure because the proposed Project would be the sole project to be handled by \nERA for a while).  ERA will employ three senior/experienced officers, one dealing with financial \nmatters, another with the urban sector, and a third with the roads and bridges. This team will be \nbacked by 7 other experts who will be engaged for a fixed-term, thus avoiding staff rotations mid \nway through the implementation process.  These experts will cover a set of sector/thematic \nmatters and a number of project implementation functional tasks. One of these experts will deal \nexclusively  with  environmental  matters.  Another  will  cover  social  development/resettlement \nissues.  The remaining five will deal with technical (engineering), administration, procurement, \nmonitoring and reporting (information technology) requirements.  \n \n                                                 \n8 The central government will provide all local counterpart funds.  ", "1 6 \n53.  The administration of the Project will be delegated to the INRM, which will, in turn, \nestablish a mobile PSU to monitor the entire implementation work, identify any additional needs \n(financial, systems and people) and work out tailored plans to address any weakness at short \nnotice.  \n \n54.  ERA itself will run the Capacity Building Component.  It makes sense to assign  this \nresponsibility to ERA and thus for ERA to be the focal point for ADB.  The capacity building \nprogram crosses line departments, although it also benefits ERA itself. The bulk of the Urban \nSector Component will be handled by two PIUs established by ERA, one each in Jammu and \nKashmir, which will include staff from PHED and UEED. The Transport Sector Component will \nbe handled by two PIUs established by ERA, one each in Jammu and Kashmir, which will \ninclude staff from PWD.  ERA will also implement procurement of vehicles and equipment for \ngarbage collection under the Urban Sector Component.  ERA will set up a simple but effective \nmanagement information system to track the work of all PIUs. This will start with the work plans \nand follow the progress made along each phase of the implementation cycle.   \n \n55.  The PIUs will be headed by separate project managers. These will be recruited locally.  \nThey will need to demonstrate past experience with the types of civil works to be carried out \nunder  the  Project.  The  approach  will  be  to  either  outsource  the  task  to  management \nprofessionals , or to engage the services of qualified line department staff.  In either case, a key \nprinciple is experience and continuity, thus the call for a fixed term appointment. The PIUs will \nbe supported on a day-to-day basis by the DSCs. \n \n56.  The staff of PMU and PIUs will be financed by the loan on an incremental basis. They will \nbe trained/supported by transitional assistance prior to the loan effectiveness, and by PMC and \nDSCs after the loan becomes effective. A Steering Committee will be set up for this purpose. It \nwill be chaired by ERA\u2019s CEO and consist of Commissioners/Secretaries in charge of the Public \nWorks, Planning, Housing and Urban Development, PHED, UEED, Tourism and Power. The \nSteering Committee will convene as required. The State Government may also wish to place \nother senior staff as observers or direct members of the Committee. This arrangement will give \nthe key line departments full ownership of the Project and provide a forum to address problems \nas they arise.    \n \n57.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 4 years (see Appendix 7). This \nschedule is tight but realistic if the proposed implementation arrangements work out according \nto plan. Any weaknesses in the organizational chain will inevitably lead to delays.  The security \naspect is of paramount importance here and civil works cannot be carried out during winter.  \n \nH.   Procurement  \n \n58.  Procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nAll  procurement  contracts  under  all  components  will  contain  anticorruption  provisions  as \nspecified by ADB. ICB procedures will be used to procure goods and related services estimated \nat more than $500,000. International Shopping (IS) procedures will be followed for procurement \nof goods estimated at between $100,000 and $500,000. For small, specialized equipment and \nmaterials contracts valued less than $100,000, direct procurement procedures acceptable to \nADB will be followed.  \n \n59.  Civil works contracts over $10 million will be procured through ICB, and those estimated \nto  cost  $10 million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  LCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nInternational bidders are not likely to show much interest in civil works of less than $10 million in ", "17  \nthis region at this point in time.  Main contract bidders are encouraged to use local J&K \ncompanies as subcontractors. The subcontractors will not be allowed to further subcontract their \nwork. In addition, to help alleviate unemployment in J&K, all contractors will be encouraged to \nrecruit  labor  locally,  rather  than  importing  this  from  outside  the  State. This approach still \nmaintains  the  principles  of  competition,  fairness,  efficiency  and  transparency.  Indicative \nprocurement packages are given in Appendix 8.  \n \n60.  To ease the procurement process, ADB has agreed with the authorities to a single-stage \ntwo-envelope  procedure  with  post-qualification  adopted  for  civil  works  contracts  involving \nsubprojects to be implemented in the first year. For second and third year subprojects, the need \nfor a pre-qualification process will be determined on the basis of the experience gained from the \nfirst year of operations.    \n \n61.  The  water  component  works  will  involve  civil  works  with  equipment/goods  supply, \nincluding supply of pipes, laying, jointing, testing and commissioning. All water supply contracts \n(transmission and distribution networks) combining the civil works with equipment/goods supply \nwill be treated as civil works contracts irrespective of the percentage of costs classified as \nmechanical or material.9 \n  \n62.  For the road subcomponent a design-as-you-build form of contract has been adopted.  \nPackages will be developed on a district by district basis. DSCs will review and approve traffic \nforecasts, design standards and cost estimates and verification, all matters subject to the \nendorsement of the PMC.  \n \n63.  The bridge subcomponent covers a large number of small works (each costing around \n$0.2-$0.7 million).  Many of these works are in remote areas in the State (scattered across 14 \ndistricts). It is unlikely that private contractors will express much interest in such small and \nscattered  works.  For  decades,  J&KPCC  has  been  an  implementing  agency  for  the  State \nGovernment responsible for the construction of bridges and rehabilitation. In view of the size of \nthe works and their location, and the importance to get the rehabilitation process off the ground \nquickly, the construction of small bridges valued at less than $0.5 million will be entrusted to \nJ&KPCC on a force-account basis.  This approach is deemed to be an optimal solution under \nthe current circumstances.   \n \n64.  Advance actions for the procurement of civil works to be implemented in the first year \nwere approved by the Management Review Meeting on 23 September 2004. ADB has advised \nthe Government that this approval does not commit ADB to finance the Project. ADB will \nmonitor closely contract awards and contract variations.    \n \nI.  Consulting Services  \n \n65.  Consulting services will be provided under the loan in two packages. A first consulting \nservice  package  targets  project  management  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  This work is \ndirected at a consulting firm with international and domestic experience, including experience \nwith projects funded by multilaterals such as ADB and the World Bank.  Due to the security \nsituation in J&K, it is proposed to select the firm from qualified domestic firms. The estimated \nperson-months budgeted for this contract amounts to 583 and the cost is in the region of $5.6 \nmillion. A second consulting service package is directed to support the line agencies with regard \nto design and construction supervision. The work will require the services of a domestic firm of \n                                                 \n9  It is generally expected that the percentage of equipment/goods in such contracts would not exceed 70%. ", "1 8 \nconsultants.  It is envisaged that four DSCs will be put in place, each covering urban and road \nsector components but split between Jammu and Kashmir.  The team of advisors will work \ndirectly with the PIUs. The estimated person-months needed to staff the four DSCs is 1,626. \nThe cost of this package is about $8.7 million (Supplementary Appendices M and N).  \n \n66.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures  for  recruiting  firms  under  full  technical  proposals  and  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for \nrecruiting  individual  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nHowever, since the PMC and DSCs need to be mobilized by April 2005, the period of ADBBO \nlisting for the expressions of interest (EOI) is proposed to be shortened to 30 days (subject to \nADB approval). This time threshold is followed by all other multilateral banks. Since EOIs can be \nadvertised through the ADB website, this shorter period is considered sufficient for consultants \nto  respond.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  approve  advance  actions  for  the \nengagement of advisors for the PMC and the DSCs. The Government has been advised that \nthis action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \nJ.   Disbursement Arrangements \n \n67.  Loan proceeds will be disbursed to ERA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001) and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations for LIBOR-\nbased Loan Products.  A second generation imprest account (SGIA) will be opened in a current \naccount in a commercial bank by ERA, subject to the commitment by the State and ERA to \nadhere  to  the  ADB  procedures  for  operating  second  generation  imprest  accounts.  The \nDepartment of Expenditure10 will pass on the rupee equivalent  of  ADB\u2019s  imprest  advance \ndirectly to the commercial bank SGIA established by ERA. The Government of India has \nassured ADB that all ADB disbursements for imprest advance and/or replenishment will be \npassed on to ERA for deposit into the commercial bank SGIA within 30 calendar days of receipt \nof such advance/replenishment from ADB.  \n \n68.  The initial and all the subsequent amounts to be deposited into the imprest account and \ninto the SGIA will be determined by ADB in consultation with DEA and  ERA, with particular \nreference to the pipeline of awarded contracts. There will be limitations on this. The drawdown \nwill not exceed the lesser of the equivalent of 3 months of current project expenditures or 10% \nof the total loan amount and will be estimated based on actual disbursements expected under \ncontracts over the upcoming months. ERA will maintain each SGIA advance/replenishment in \nthe separate commercial bank account established for the SGIA (which will be a current \naccount), and draw from it only the portion of expenditures eligible for ADB financing. The ERA \nwill warrant that funds in the SGIA will be used only to fund eligible expenditures in accordance \nwith  the  terms  of  Loan  Agreement  and  to  meet  the  immediate  short-term  disbursement \nrequirements of the Project. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be adopted for \nreimbursing and liquidating the SGIA for eligible expenditures not exceeding $50,000 per \npayment, except as ADB may otherwise agree during project implementation. \n \n69.  Amounts in the SGIA are only to be used to finance the ADB portion of any expenditure. \nCounterpart funds will be required for each such expenditure. ERA will establish a separate \naccount for consolidating the counterpart funds and the ADB funds. ERA will draw the ADB \nportion of each expenditure from the SGIA into the consolidating account to make consolidated \n                                                 \n10  Plan Finance I Division, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance.

ADB  will  provide  guidance  in  the \nestablishment of the Project accounts during the implementation inception mission. \n  \nK.  Accounting and Auditing Requirements \n \n70.   The PMU and the PIUs will establish and maintain separate records for works, goods, \nand services financed out of loan proceeds. They shall also maintain separate project accounts \nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for all expenditures incurred on the \nProject and the subprojects, whether out of loan proceeds or other sources. \n  \n71.   Detailed consolidated annual project accounts, as maintained by the PMU, will be \naudited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference are \nacceptable to ADB and will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of the fiscal year11. \nThe annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest account, SGIA, and SOE procedure, \nand will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds operation of \nthe SGIA, and compliance with SOE procedures. ERA has been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on \ndelayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited \naccounts.  \n \nL.  Project Supervision, Review, and Reporting \n \n72.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after the loan approval of the proposed \nProject.  A  discussion  will  be  held  during  the  inception  mission  on  the  establishment  of \nnecessary  arrangements  for  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  (PPM).  The  PPM \nsystem will be developed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System \nHandbook. The PPM system will first select a set of performance monitoring indicators to be \ncollected  during  the  implementation  (including  those  indicators  included  in  the  Project \nFramework in Appendix 1), and then establish baseline data for each of the selected indicators.  \nThe PPM system will also include performance monitoring indicators needed for the preparation \nof ensuing projects in the urban and transport sectors.  Thereafter, PIUs will conduct annual \nsurveys with the assistance of DSCs.   \n \n73.  In addition to the regular reviews at three levels (the first level by PMU, the second by \nERA and the third by ADB), a midterm review (MTR) will be conducted in June 2006. The \nreviews will include a summary of contracts awarded and pricing.  The MTR will identify \nproblems or weaknesses in implementation arrangements, and agree on changes needed. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n74.   The State proposes starting work on a comprehensive urban infrastructure project to \nbuild on the proposed Project.  A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed for \nthis purpose.  Besides carrying out the standard project preparation work, the assistance will \nalso address key policy and institutional reform issues specified under the existing ADB water \npolicy12. The PPTA will look into investment needs in water supply, sewerage, solid waste \nmanagement and drainage.  The PPTA will be implemented over 8 months, starting in the later \npart of 2005. An international consulting firm will be engaged for this purpose, subject to review \nof the security situation in J&K at the time of the engagement.  If required, a domestic consulting \nfirm  will  be  engaged.    The  recruitment  will  use  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-based method of \n                                                 \n11 Given the limited institutional capability of ERA and PIUs, 9 months is a realistic period.  \n12 ADB. 2001.

An input of 12 person-months \nof international experts and 32 person-months of domestic experts has been budgeted. The \nPPTA will be implemented through ERA. It will work with PHED, UEED and two municipal \ncorporations in Jammu and Srinagar. The total cost is estimated at $630,000 equivalent, \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $202,000 and local currency of $428,000 equivalent.  \nThe entire foreign exchange cost and $298,000 equivalent in local currency ($500,000) will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom.  The  TA  will  be \nadministered by ADB. The State will contribute to the remaining local currency cost of $130,000 \nequivalent. The full PPTA proposal is shown in a Supplementary Appendix H.  The Government \nhas been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Social Aspects  \n \n1.   Poverty Assessment \n \n75.  J&K ranks 6th in area and 17th in population among the States and Union Territories of \nIndia. The National Human Development Report (NHDR) of 2001, prepared by the Planning \nCommission, Government of India indicated that, the population below poverty line for the year \n1993\u201394 was 30.34% in rural areas and 9.18% in the urban areas. A survey undertaken in July \n2004 as part of the socioeconomic study to support project preparation found that 31.35% of the \nhouseholds are still living below the poverty line in two subproject districts of Anantnag and \nBudgam.  If the findings from the two districts were compared with the poverty data quoted in \nNHDR for the year 1993\u201394, then it would suggest that poverty within the State has remained \nalmost  same during last 10 years. The subproject sample is narrow and may not necessarily be \nfully representative of the situation in other districts.  The Project and other initiatives under the \nturnaround economic program will go some way to raising the level of welfare.    \n \n76.  State statistics also indicate that some 80% of the population derives their income from \nagriculture. Less than 10% of State revenue is generated by this sector. It is also noted in data \navailable for 1995/96 that marginal landowners13 comprised around 78% of population. Average \nland holding size is estimated14 at 0.76 hectare (ha). There is a high dependency on the sector \nfundamentally  primary  commodities  instead  of  value-added  agro  processing.  The  services \nindustry, in particular tourism, needs revitalizing. For that to happen many other things have to \nhappen. Greater stability and adequate infrastructure facilities and utility services are key \nenabling preconditions.   \n \n77.  The Project will have a positive impact on economic welfare and by definition on poverty \nreduction. It enhances the mobility  and contributes to productivity and efficiency.  The water \noperation reduces health risks and aids investments in other services. The entire operation \ncreates jobs in the construction process (permanent and temporary) and affects on a direct \nbasis the lives of the rural and urban populations in both key cities. The transport sector \ncomponent will provide the rural poor with access to markets. Some of these opportunities are \nclosed through the sheer physical impossibility to move from one place to another. In the case \nof the two road subprojects, the team carried out a distribution analysis. The poverty impact \n                                                 \n13  Defined as having a land holding of below 1.0 ha.  \n14  J&K Development Report. ", "21  \nratio for (i) Qazikund to Kulgam subproject, and (ii) Raithan to Palmaidan to Arizol subproject \nwas 0.43, and 0.37, respectively, both of which are above the percentage of populations below \npoverty line in these areas (31%). The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is given \nin Appendix 9 and the Poverty Assessment is attached to Supplementary Appendix O.  \n \n   2.   Indigenous People \n \n78.  J&K is home to a total of eleven major tribes, namely Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gara/Garba, \nMon, etc. (see Supplementary Appendix E). Among these, Gujjars and Bakarwals constitute a \nsignificant proportion of the population, with a concentration in Jammu, Rajouri, Udhampur, \nPoonch, Uri, Ganderbal, Anantnag, Daksum and Kandi areas.  A detailed survey was conducted \nfor  the  purposes  of  sample  subprojects.    A  small  presence  of  a  scheduled tribe group \ncomprising  of  Ban  Gujjars,  the  nomadic  tribe  who  are  primarily  engaged  in  pastoral  and \nherdsman occupation, was found in the sample road subproject districts of Anantnag and \nBudgam. The scheduled tribe population is largely assimilated with the non-IP population and \nthe Project will not have any impacts on their socioeconomic conditions or lead to any disruption \nin their community life or culture. The improved road network will improve this tribal community\u2019s \naccess to services along with other sections of the subproject population.  During preparation of \nthe additional subprojects if any impacts are identified on the indigenous people, an Indigenous \nPeople\u2019s  Development  Plan  (IPDP)  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous People in line with an agreed Indigenous People\u2019s Development Framework.  \n \n3.  Gender and HIV/AIDS \n \n79.  J&K  ranks  25th  on  the  Gender  Disparity  Index  (GDI)  with  a  value  of  0.74015  in \ncomparison to that of India.16 The gender ratio of the population is 900 females for every 1,000 \nmales (2001 Census). The literacy rate for the State is 54.46% with 65.75% for males and \n41.82% for females (Census 2001). Women, especially those who are poor, spend a minimum \nof 1 hour everyday on water collection and at times the duration doubles, taking into account the \nnon-availability of water in the vicinity. Since women, particularly poor women and children, \nhave the main responsibility within the household for fetching, storing and using water for \nwashing and cooking, a fundamental direct beneficiary of the water supply component will be \nthis gender group.  Provision of drainage facilities will also contribute to the improvement of \npublic health, a major area of concern. The roads and bridges component will improve access to \neducational  and  medical  facilities.  It  would  also  facilitate  visits  from  qualified  medical \npractitioners.  The lack of access to toilet facilities is also of concern.  The NHDR records that \nonly 9.6% of households in the State had access to these  facilities, lower than that of the \nnational average (49.3%).  The water supply sample subproject provides low cost toilets in the \nareas where migrants are settled (Supplementary Appendix P). \n \n80.  The statistics of the National AIDS Control Organization for 2001 show India to having \nclose to 4 million HIV infected people, around 0.4% of the country\u2019s population which is highest \nin any country in South Asian region.  HIV infection was previously concentrated among the \nmarginalized groups, including sex workers and drug users, but the infection is spreading \nrapidly to the general population including truck drivers. According to the Jammu & Kashmir \nAIDS Control Society, the state of J&K is estimated to have 24,000 cases of HIV infections as of \nNovember 2002, 0.2% of the state population. Researchers in the state have identified migrant \nlaborers, truck drivers and security forces deployed here as the main AIDS carriers. J&K has \n                                                 \n15 National Human Development Report 2001by Planning Commission, Government of India.  \n16 India with GDI value of 0.574 ranks 103rd in the World (UNDP Human Development Indicators 2003). ", "2 2 \nbeen categorized as a low prevalence state with regard to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Project \ncovers mainly secondary road network such as rural roads in which the HIV/AIDS issue is less \nrelevant than is the case with the national corridors where the long distance truck drivers are \nmain users.  Given the current level of the transmission of the disease at J&K, an awareness \ncampaign on the epidemic has been a priority area of action being carried out by J&KACS.  \n \nB.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n81.  Subprojects with significant land acquisition (LA) or resettlement requirements will not be \nincluded in the Project.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995),  in  the  event  that  environment,  social  and  safety  considerations  or  engineering \nrequirements result in land acquisition or involuntary resettlement becoming unavoidable during \ndetailed design or project implementation, a Resettlement Framework has been developed \n(Appendix 10). The Resettlement Framework will apply to all subprojects, including sample \nsubprojects.   \n \n82.  In the case of the two sample road subprojects, which would be implemented within the \nexisting right of ways (ROW), no resettlement is anticipated. The road width of 7.5 m (inclusive \nof shoulder of 1 m on either side) is available and therefore would not entail any losses of land. \nThe field survey, however, identified several habitations in which sample roads pass through \nbuilt up areas and some congestion was noted on the alignment in terms of the width.17 As per \ntechnical design, special provisions are to be made in such case to reduce roadway width, and \nthus avoid resettlement impacts in terms of loss of land, structure or any other productive asset \nof any group, person or community.  Rehabilitation of the Kanni Kadal Bridge in Srinagar City \nwill be undertaken under the Project.  While the bridge will entail a minor widening of 0.5m for \nconstruction of pedestrian footpaths at each side of the bridge, it would not affect the access \nroads since both bridge and access roads are currently of two lane standards.  During detailed \ndesign  of  the  sample  subprojects,  if  it  is  determined  that  bridge  construction  or  road \nrehabilitation will affect people adversely, a resettlement plan will be prepared and affected \npersons compensated in accordance with the Resettlement Framework.  \n \n83.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts for the two sample urban subprojects are \nexpected to be insignificant. The sample subprojects will lead to better water supply and storm \nwater drainage network conditions. The improvement of water supply systems would not entail \nany  land  acquisition  as  PHED/State  Government  land  is  available  free  from  any  from \nencumbrances and encroachments. The laying of water pipes for improving the distribution \nnetwork and rehabilitation of the drainage system, to be carried out along existing roads/ROW, \nmay lead to some minimal land acquisition and temporary disruption for roadside shops/stalls, \nwhich cannot be identified at this stage without detailed design being developed. \n \n84.  Resettlement plans for later subprojects that may be identified under the Project will be \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed \nResettlement Framework provided in Appendix 10. The ERA will ensure that under contracts for \ncivil works, no contractor will commence construction or displacement of persons until affected \npersons have been compensated in accordance with the resettlement plan acceptable to ADB. \nIf during implementation of any subproject there are any changes in the subproject design that \nresult in any additional affected persons or any changes to the impacts on previously identified \n                                                 \n17 When the security situation allows, the transitional assistance consultants and the ERA will carry out a more \ndetailed survey and public consultation and, if necessary, establish a cut off date for affected persons. Because of \nthe sparsely populated nature of the area, it is not expected that designation of the cut off date at that point would \ncause major problems. ", "23  \naffected persons, the resettlement plan will be promptly updated and implemented satisfactory \nto ADB.  \n \nC.   Environmental Assessment  \n \n85.  The Project is categorized as an environment category \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The rehabilitation of existing roads, bridges, water supply \nsystem, and drainage system, falls within the existing ROW or lots without causing any major \nresettlement  of  people.    It  is  not  subject  to  the  1994  India  Environmental  Assessment \nNotification.  \n \n86.  An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for the entire Project, containing IEEs for five \nsample subprojects, was prepared in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines. The IEE shows that the Project may generate minor environmental impacts, but, by \nimplementing mitigation measures described in the IEE, the environmental impacts could be \nminimized to an acceptable level. ERA will be responsible for ensuring that PIUs implement the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) included in the subproject IEEs at any phases. A \nsummary  IEE  (SIEE)  was  prepared  based  on  the  IEE,  and  attached  as  Supplementary \nAppendix Q.  \n \n87.  For future subprojects, the Environmental Assessment Framework was prepared and \nattached as Supplementary Appendix D.  The eligibility criteria set out that those subprojects \nthat fall under environment categories A or Sensitive B will not be included in the Project. \nTherefore, no subproject will be in, or close to, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, or any other \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. For each of the subprojects, an IEE and SIEE will be prepared \nby the PIUs and reviewed/approved by the PMU/ERA for ensuring that the subproject is in \ncompliance with safeguard policies of the national and local governments as well as those of \nADB. For the first three subprojects of each component and for subprojects greater than $1.5 \nmillion, these SIEE and IEE will be submitted to ADB for further review and approval.  If there \nare any changes in specific locations or alignments of major infrastructure or project facilities \nafter the process of IEE, additional environmental assessment will be carried out and a process \nsimilar to IEE, acceptable to ADB, will be undertaken. ERA will submit to ADB progress reports \non the implementation of EMPs. All documents on environmental issues including IEEs, and \nprogress reports will be properly kept as part of the project document and made available to the \npublic if required. Each of PMU/ERA and PIUs will appoint qualified environment specialists. \nCapacity building on environmental issues will be tackled through training.   \n \nD.  Economic and Financial Assessment  \n \n88.  The  Project  incorporates  three  economic  eligibility  criteria  for  the  subprojects:  (i) \ndemonstrate the economic rationale in terms of concept and the nature of the market; (ii) \ndemonstrate the cost effectiveness either through the least cost analysis or the calculation of \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR); and (iii) ensure sustainability, both financially and \ninstitutionally.  \n89.  The Project deals with services in demand.  Water supply is not only a requirement by \nend users, it is also an obligation of local government to ensure its delivery.  This delivery needs \nto meet three basic targets: quality, continuity and coverage.  Road and bridges provide access \nto markets and mobility opportunities for people and businesses.  Trade, productivity, operating \ncosts and incomes are all linked to a better system and network.  The Project will yield \nsubstantial short, medium and long-term benefits to the community. Sample subprojects were ", "2 4 \nsubjected to an economic evaluation.  The returns were positive in all cases, a priori in excess \nof the cost of capital (see Supplementary Appendices Q and R).  The Project team also worked \nout a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the sample subprojects. The latter was computed \non an after tax basis, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital. The results \nwere positive in all instances.    \nE.   Sustainability \n \n90.    Sustainability  is  related  to  the  quality  of  the  works,  but  in  particular  to  the  future \ngeneration and allocation of funds to cover O&M needs.  Currently line departments have been \ngetting the annual budget allocation of approximately $9.5 million for water supply/drainage and \nroad/bridge sectors.  This allocation is clearly not enough to cover the incremental costs for \nmaintaining the assets to be rehabilitated under the proposed Project. The State Government \nneeds to make additional allocation to cover potential incremental recurrent O&M cost, and debt \nservice obligation associated with the Project. These additional costs are estimated to be \napproximately $3.8 million in 2008/09, which will be further increased to $9.4 million in 2013/14. \nFurthermore,  for  every  five  years,  additional  an  $5  million  will  be  required  for  periodic \nmaintenance of roads and bridges. The State Government has agreed to make these additional \nfunds available. (See Supplementary Appendix V).  Given the priority accorded to this Project by \nthe State, it appears that the sustainability issue will be reasonably well covered.  \n \n91.  While sustainability depends on budget allocations, revenue generation is also a key \nconsideration.  In the case of water, basic fees are already being charged.  These are not high \nenough to meet O&M needs.  As a result, the State Government has agreed to put up tariffs \neven in the absence of significant improvements in the quality and coverage of the service.   It \nwill also tighten up on the billing and collection practice.  Cash flow is limited largely on this \naccount. Operational improvements will come from the reduction in water loses.  These are \nsimply too high at present.  More in-depth structural, regulatory and operational issues are \nexpected to be tackled through the follow-on project in 2006.  In the meantime, the objective is \nto correct some significant bottlenecks.  PHED proposes to double the current water tariff by \nMarch 2005 for all types of connections, both domestic and commercial.  The State will also \nintroduce metering of bulk water supply at the source and distribution centers, and commercial \nestablishments falling in the project area. These assurances are incorporated in the loan \nagreement.  Over the longer term, connection based charges need to be stepped up and \nconverted into a consumption based system. To achieve this objective it will be necessary to \nhave most, if not all, of the connections metered.  Metering requires a broad based dialogue \nwith key stakeholders. To facilitate this process ERA has agreed to do public awareness \nprograms.  But before this process can be implemented, end users also need to see real \nimprovements in the delivery. \n \n92.   O&M issues for non-tollable roads are basically institutional in nature.  They require a \nsystem-wide approach, rather than project-by-project approach. The proposed Project calls for \nthe introduction of a road maintenance system supported by the systematic collection of road \nconditions data throughout the entire State (including the purchase of equipment for measuring \nroad conditions).  An agreement was reached on the need to establish a road fund. A study will \nbe carried out on the best financing mechanisms to cater for O&M.   \n \nF.   Risks  \n \n93.  The Project is fundamentally sound but it will be implemented under circumstances of  (i) \nlimited institutional capacity and (ii) some security concerns. The first can be tackled through ", "25  \nspecific operational support for project management and design and construction supervision. \nThe Project scope has been made narrow and the subproject criteria specific.   Subprojects \ncalling for significant land acquisition, resettlement and environmental issues are to be excluded \nfrom ADB financing. The PIUs will include staff from PHED, UEED and PWD which are already \ndoing rehabilitation work, though on a limited scale. Their capabilities will be boosted by the \ncapacity building component to be provided by PMC and DSCs.  J&K mirrors the experience in \nother states in India.  They all start with similar limitations, but soon develop capacity to \nsuccessfully implement their projects.  This has been demonstrated with past ADB projects.   \n \n94.  Another risk factor of the Project is security. This risk will be addressed partially or in full \nby taking several measures.  The use of local resources, including the use of a State-owned \nconstruction company on a force account basis for small works will go a long way to minimizing \nsome of the problems.  The Project would allow contractors and consultants to make their own \nsecurity arrangements under the contracts.  The security situation may limit the ability of ADB \nstaff  in  headquarters  to  monitor  the  Project  directly.    The  Project  administration  will  be  \ndelegated to  INRM, which will establish a PSU consisting of one oversight staff consultant \nbased at INRM and two staff consultants based in J&K- one for the urban component and the \nother for the road component. This team will be dedicated solely to the Project and will move \nbetween Delhi, Jammu and Srinagar, as required, security concerns permitting.  INRM senior \nstaff will supervise and be responsible for the activities of the PSU. The objective of this local \nteam is to be on call and fully mobile in order to inform, guide and monitor actions taken on all \nfronts by ERA and the PIUs, especially in areas related to ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. ADB \nsecurity advisor will periodically update general security situation in J&K and provide security \nadvice from time to time to INRM and PSU. This may entail rescheduling of the project \nmonitoring and supervision activities, such that project implementation will not be affected.  \n \n95.  Lack of counterpart funding is a common cause of project delays for state level projects.  \nThis is not expected to be the case here.  The central Government confirmed that it would \nprovide the entire amount of the local counterpart funds to J&K.   Another common cause of \ndelays is land acquisition and resettlement, especially when these need to be undertaken in line \nwith ADB policies and procedures.  The eligibility criteria and the agreements call for the \nexclusion of subprojects with difficulties in these areas, though ADB procedures will still be \nfollowed  where  any  are  identified.  The  implementation  will  be  supported  by  experts  with \nexperience in safeguards.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n96.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.   \n \n(i)  The  State  Government  and  ERA  will  have  joint  responsibility  as  executing \nagencies (EAs) for the execution of the Project. The State will ensure that ERA \nhas all delegated and other powers necessary to carry out its function as EA.  \n  \n(ii)  The  State  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of \nrequired counterpart funds are made and released in a timely manner to ERA \nand by ERA to each PIU for each financial year of the Project implementation \nperiod and that the PMU and each PIU applies such counterpart funds to agreed \nproject  expenditures.  The  State  Government  and  ERA  will  ensure  that  the ", "2 6 \nfacilities provided under the Project are operated and maintained appropriately, \nand  that  adequate  budgetary  and  other  resources  will  be  provided  for  this \npurpose. \n \n(iii)  The State Government will double the current water tariffs by June 2005 for all \ntypes of connections, both domestic and commercial and will introduce metering \nof bulk water supply at the source and distribution centers, and commercial \nestablishments falling in the Project area.  The State Government and ERA will \nundertake, under the PPTA, public awareness campaigns on water metering of \ndomestic connections and consumption-based tariff systems. \n \n(iv)  The DEA and the Department of Finance of the State will ensure that all ADB \ndisbursements for imprest advance and/or replenishment will be passed on to \nERA  for  deposit  into  the  commercial  bank  current  account SGIA within 30 \ncalendar days of receipt of such advance/replenishment from ADB. The ERA will \nmaintain each SGIA imprest advance/replenishment received in the separate \ncommercial bank current account established for this purpose, and withdraw from \nit only to fund eligible current project expenditures. \n \n(v)  The State Government and ERA will ensure that consolidated annual Project \naccounts are audited by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, and that the \nannual  audit  report,  including  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds and compliance with SGIA and SOE procedures, is submitted to ADB \nwithin 9 months of the close of the fiscal year.   \n \n(vi)  The State Government and ERA will ensure that staff, consultants, materials, \nvehicles, equipment and other items required for project implementation will be \ngiven  reasonable  access  to  the  project  area,  and  will  take  all  measures \nnecessary to ensure the safety of all project personnel, including consultants and \ncontractors, during the implementation of the Project. \n \n(vii)  The State Government and ERA will ensure to the extent possible, subprojects \nwill not require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement.

CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES  \n \nA.  Eligibility Criteria for Subprojects \n \n1.  The Project would finance only those subprojects, which meet the following eligibility \ncriteria:  \n \n(i)  The subproject will be for the rehabilitation of infrastructure in the transport and \nurban  sectors  including  a  reasonable  level  of  upgrading.  The  judgment  on \nwhether a specific investment is expansion or rehabilitation should be made on a \nsystem-by-system basis, but not on an equipment-by-equipment or component \nby component basis.  \n(ii)  The  subproject  will  have  clear  economic  rationale.  The  economic  rationale \nincludes an analysis of the market for the subproject's output and assess its \ndemand. The problem to be address by subprojects should be defined, together \nwith identification of options for technical solutions. \n(iii)  The subproject will be cost effective. This usually involves a review of technical \noptions available to address the identified problem and selecting the least cost \noption. Alternatively, economic efficiency may be demonstrated by the calculation \nof economic internal rate of return based on \u201cwith and without\u201d subproject basis \nwhich will be equal to or higher than 12%.   \n(iv)  The subproject will be sustainable. Financial sustainability is demonstrated if their \nfinancial internal rate of return is equal to or higher than weighted average cost of \ncapital for those subprojects where usages are charged to users.  If this criterion \nis not met, other necessary arrangements/systems should be made/introduced to \nensure that operation and maintenance costs of the subprojects are financed and \nthat the project operates over its expected life. Institutional sustainability must \nalso  be  ensured.  This  may  be  demonstrated  by  assessing  the  project \nimplementation unit's (PIU\u2019s) organization, staffing and skill sets.  If they do not \nhave  adequate  institutional  capacity,  necessary  capacity  building  assistance \nwould be provided in the Project. \n(v)  The  subproject  will,  to  the  extent  possible,  not  require  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement (which includes the displacement of squatters or encroachers from \nthe rights of way).  If land acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for a \nsubproject, a Resettlement Plan will be prepared in accordance with applicable \nlaws  and  regulations  of  the  State  Government,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and the Resettlement Framework (Appendix 10).   \n(vi)  If any indigenous peoples/scheduled tribes are likely to be affected significantly \nby a subproject, an indigenous people development plan (IPDP) will be prepared \nin  accordance  with  the  Indigenous  people  development  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix E).  \n(vii)  Environmental  assessment  of  the  subproject  will  have  been  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  Environmental  Assessment  Framework  (Supplementary \nAppendix D).  The subproject will not have been be classified as Environmental ", "32    Appendix 2 \nCategory \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB Sensitive\" in accordance with ADB\u2019s criteria, and an initial \nenvironmental examination will have been prepared.   \n(viii)  The  subproject  will  be  technically  sound,  meeting  design  standards  of  the \nGovernment of India or other equivalent technical authorities.  It should also \nincorporate appropriate road safety requirements such as guardrail at build up \nareas, road signage and road marking along the project roads. \n(ix)  The subproject will be designed and executed as seismic resistant structure in \naccordance with relevant government guidelines. \n(x)  All necessary approvals of the Government of India and the J&K State will be \nobtained prior to the award of any contract for civil works or supply of equipment \nor materials. \nB.  Procedures \n2.  All subprojects will be prepared and processed in accordance with the procedures set \nout below.  \n \n(i)  PIUs will select a possible subproject from the priority candidate subproject list \n(to be developed by the State) in consultation with the Project Management Unit \n(PMU).  PIUs will then conduct a feasibility study for the subproject including its \ncost estimate. PIUs will also prepare (a) an initial poverty and social assessment \n(IPSA) and fill out a checklist for (b) involuntary resettlement; (c) indigenous \npeople; and (d) an environmental screening.  \n \n(ii)  PIUs will submit to PMU (a) a feasibility study report, (b) IPSA, and (c) the above \nchecklists.  PMU  will  review  these  reports  with  support  of  the  Project \nManagement Consultant (PMC). If PMU finds that the proposed subproject is \neligible in light of the eligibility criteria and the reports are in order, PMU will send \nthose reports to ADB for further review, to obtain necessary guidance with regard \nto the extent of relevant analysis, assessment or plans.  \n \n(iii)  ADB will review the reports submitted by the PMU. If ADB finds that a proposed \nsubproject is not likely to satisfy the eligibility criteria and/or that the agreed \nprocedures, ADB will advise the PMU either (a) to modify the subproject proposal \nin a manner that will make it eligible for approval or (b) that the subproject must \nbe rejected.  If a subproject is rejected, the PMU may propose a replacement \nsubproject.  If the ADB finds that the proposed subproject is likely to satisfy the \neligibility  criteria  and  procedures,  ADB  will  advise  whether,  based  on  the \nresettlement checklist a Resettlement Plan is required, and if so, whether a short, \nor a full Resettlement Plan is required, and based on the indigenous people \nchecklist, whether an IPDP is required.  The initial environmental examination \n(IEE) is required for all subprojects. \n \n(iv)  The above procedure described in (iii) will be applied only to those subprojects \nwhose size of the subproject exceeds $1.5 million. If the subproject in question is \nequal to or less than $1.5 million in project cost, the above review would be \ncarried out by PMU.  However, this would not be applied for the first 3 non-\nsample  subprojects  for  each  of  water  supply,  drainage,  road  and  bridge ", "  Appendix 2  33\nsubsectors: in those cases, the review would be carried out by ADB as set out in \n(iii).  \n \n(v)  Following the review described in (iii) or (iv) by PMU and/or ADB, the relevant \nPIU will conduct preliminary design and/or detailed design or other similar design \nworks and, based on those works, develop a Resettlement Plan (if required) and \nIPDP  (if  required),  and  undertake  an  IEE  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) with support of design and supervision consultants (or \ntransitional assistance consultants). \n \n(vi)  The PIU will disclose the Resettlement Plan (if required), IPDP (if required) and \nIEE to the affected persons and incorporate the results of the consultation. \n \n(vii)  The reports of preliminary design/other design work, including the Resettlement \nPlan (if required), IPDP (if required) and IEE, will be submitted by the PIU to the \nPMU for its appraisal. PMU will appraise the reports with support of PMC in light \nof the relevant frameworks and following examples provided by the ADB based \non the appraisal of the sample subprojects.  Based on the review, PMU will \nprepare a summary appraisal report for each of the subprojects.  If PMU finds \nthat the proposed subproject does satisfy the eligibility criteria and procedures, \nPMU will approve the subprojects if an individual subproject is equal to or less \nthan $1.5 million in terms of the project cost. If the project cost of a subproject is \ngreater than $1.5 million, PMU will send the summary appraisal reports, together \nwith relevant safeguard documents (the Resettlement Plan [if required], IPDP [if \nrequired] and IEE) to ADB for further review and approval. \n \n(viii)  However, even if the project cost of individual subproject is equal to or less than \n$1.5 million, ADB's approval is required for the following cases:  \n \n(cid:131) When  the  subproject  in  question  is  among  the  first  3  non-sample \nsubprojects  for  each  of  water  supply,  drainage,  road  and  bridge \nsubsectors; \n \n(cid:131) When the subproject in question requires a full resettlement plan; or \n \n(cid:131) When  the  subproject  in  question  requires  an  indigenous  people \ndevelopment plan. \n  \n(ix)  In case that the project cost of the subproject is greater than $1.5 million and \nADB received the summary appraisal reports and relevant safeguard documents, \nADB will review those documents. If ADB finds that the proposed subproject \ndoes  satisfy  the  eligibility  criteria  and  procedures,  ADB  will  approve  the \nsubproject.  If  ADB  finds  that  the  proposed  subproject  does  not  satisfy  the \neligibility  criteria  and  procedures,  or  does  not  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies, ADB may (a) advise PMU on remedial actions to be taken for the \nproposed subproject in order for it to comply or (b) reject the subproject.   \n \n(x)  The ADB review described in para (viii) and (ix) will be carried out by the sector \ndivision or India Resident Mission (INRM) except as described in this paragraph.  \nIf the subproject in question is valued at more than $1.5 million, ADB's review of \ncompliance with environmental assessment and indigenous people development ", "34    Appendix 2 \nrequirements will be carried out by the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment  (RSDD)  in  ADB  headquarters.    If  the  subproject  requires  a  full \nResettlement  Plan,  ADB  review  will  be  carried  out  by  RSDD  in  ADB \nheadquarters regardless of the value of the subproject.  The results of all reviews \ncarried out by INRM will be reported to ADB headquarters. \n \n(xi)  If all necessary approvals of the Government of India and the J&K State have not \nbeen obtained prior to ADB approval of a Subproject, then no contract for civil \nworks  or  supply  of  equipment  and  materials  will  be  awarded,  and  no \ndisbursement will be made for a Subproject until ADB has been provided with \nevidence  that  all  such  approvals  have  been  obtained.    The  PMU  will  be \nresponsible for obtaining all such approvals and will provide ADB with a report \nshowing that all approvals have been obtained prior to the award of any contract \nfor civil works or supply of equipment or materials and prior to any disbursement \nfor the Subproject.  The review and approval of this report will be carried out by \nthe resident mission or sector division. \n \n3.  The above review, appraisal, or approval conducted by PMU is subject to the post-facto \nreview by ADB as needed.  If the post-facto review shows that PMU has not complied with \nthese procedures (including if PMU has approved subprojects that do not comply with the \neligibility criteria), then ADB may revoke the delegation to PMU.  PMU/PIUs will ensure that \nADB will be given access to all relevant documents on which PMU/PIUs\u2019 screening, preparation \nand processing of subprojects are based. Those documents will be kept for five years for \npossible ADB review.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  35\nURBAN SECTOR COMPONENT \n \nA.   Rationale \n \n1.  The Urban Sector Component of this Project Comprises rehabilitation of water supply \nand drainage infrastructure in Srinagar and Jammu.  The current water supply and drainage \nsituation in these two cities is summarized below.      \n \n2.  Srinagar:  Srinagar city is in the Kashmir Valley at an elevation of 1,600 m above mean \nsea level (MSL). The River Jhelum flows through the city.  The city has a number of large water \nbodies, including the famous Dal and Nagin Lakes.  The city receives an average annual rainfall \nof 1200 mm.  \n \n3.   The water supply system in Srinagar is primarily composed of five partially interlinked \nsub-systems,  each  identified  with  reference  to  a  particular  surface  water  source.  In  four \nsubsystems raw water is drawn from perennial streams by gravity and by pumping in the Dal \nLake/Nishat Bag system, up to a treatment plant.  In all five subsystems, water from the \ntreatment plants is fed into the bulk transmission system and flows by gravity into distribution \nnetwork.  \n \n4.  The city received about 200,000 migrants who have predominantly settled along the \nmajor roads out of the city. The gravity mains from the five treatment plants come into the city \nalong these roads. The new habitations along the roads have tapped into the gravity mains \nthereby greatly reducing the quantum of water reaching the core areas of city where water \nsupply hours have been reduced from daily five hours in the early 1990\u2019s to just one hour now. \nPublic Health Engineering Department (PHED) has tried to address this problem by augmenting \nthe water production capacity and has expanded the capacity of treatment plants.  However, the \nexisting transmission network is inadequate to carry the increased production due to corrosion \nand leakage from the pipes, especially the larger diameter feeder mains.  Old and inefficient \npumping machinery also constrain water production.  Quantity and quality of water from the \nsources is reportedly adequate and satisfactory.      \n \n5.  The city\u2019s saucer bowl shaped topography with many parts of the city being lower than \nthe high flood level has resulted in large-scale water logging and frequent flooding.  Unlike most \nother cities in India, which have open drains (nallas) or open constructed drains, in Srinagar \nmajor drains are all underground and covered. This is because the topography is so flat that \nunless the main drains are very deep, no gradient will be available to ensure flows in the main \nand secondary network.  Public safety concerns require drains of such depths running through \nthe busy areas of the town to be covered.  While the covered drain has the advantages of acting \nlike a combined sewer and leads to better sanitation and aesthetics, extensive pumping of storm \nwater is required. This is reflected by the 83 storm water pumping stations spread throughout \nthe  city,  with  the  corresponding  high  Operation  and  Maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The \nindiscriminate dumping of municipal solid waste in city streets and drains further aggravates the \ndrainage problems.    \n \n6.  Jammu:  The city has an undulating terrain ranging from an elevation of 290 m to 450m \nabove MSL. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,000 mm. The River Tawi flows \nthrough the city. Water supply to the city is from 130 tubewells, which meet 70% of city\u2019s water \nneeds. The balance 30% of the water supply is from the River Tawi, abstracted through two \nintake wells at the Sitlee head works. Water is treated at two treatment plants at Sitlee and \npumped up to two large ground level reservoirs at Chinore and Manda. From these reservoirs, \nwater is further distributed to zonal reservoirs and distribution networks. ", "36    Appendix 3 \n7.  The water supply in Jammu suffers from aging equipment and pipes leading to high \npumping and leakage losses, inequity in distribution resulting in very low levels of supply to the \nmigrant population and outlying areas. Due to these reasons, supply level varies between 25 \nlpcd  to  300  lpcd.  The  outlying  areas  which  have  developed  over  the  last  15  years  have \ninadequate  groundwater  distribution  network  with  small  diameter  pipes  extended  from  the \nexisting zones which are unable to cope with the demand created by the influx of 0.35 million \nmigrants. \n \n8.  The city was planned to grow in a southerly direction, however, most of the migrants \nwho came in over a period of a few months in early 1990\u2019s settled in the west since the land \nwas barren and cheap. Even 14 years later, only skeletal water supply and sanitation services \nexist in this area. The western growth area is far from existing water sources and due to its \ndistance and higher elevation is only partially integrated with existing network of Jammu and the \nwater for part of this area is being supplied through tankers and public stand posts. \n  \n9.  Groundwater quantity is adequate in low lying areas near the river and the Central \nGround Water Board (CGWB), which monitors the ground water quantity and quality, reports \nthat less than 6% of groundwater is exploited. The quality of this groundwater is satisfactory. \nHowever, in the upper areas on the west bank of the Tawi River, ground water wells have failed \ndue to lack of maintenance. In general, poor maintenance of water supply infrastructure in \nJammu is an issue. PHED spends less than one percent of the asset value towards O&M, \nagainst the requirement of 3-4%. \n10.  A network of natural and constructed drains carries the city\u2019s storm water to the river. \nDrainage  in  Jammu  has  become  a  problem  due  to  lack  of  maintenance  of  natural  and \nconstructed drainage channels. Indiscriminate dumping of garbage into the drains aggravates \nthe situation.  Flooding, common in some areas, is a risk to public health and causes severe \nhardships for residents. Partial sewerage system exists in the city. Wastewater is disposed off \ninto septic tanks and open drains. \n \nB.   Objective and Scope of the Urban Component \n11.  The  urban  sector  component  designed  to  address  the  most  essential  needs  is \ncomprised of a number of subprojects as described below: \n \n(i)  Water  Supply  Rehabilitation  in  Srinagar  ($26.6  million).    The  subprojects  will \nprincipally  rehabilitate  the  existing  supply  networks,  pump  stations  and  water \ntreatment  plants,  in  order  to  restore  them  to  their  original  capacities,  thereby \nimproving  service  levels  in  the  city.    The  identified  subprojects  include:  four \nsubprojects  for  replacement  of  dilapidated  water  supply  transmission  lines,  one \nsubproject for replacement of old/damaged pumping stations and provision of stand-\nby  generators  and  power  supply  protection  equipment  and  one  subproject  to \nrehabilitate existing water treatment plants and reservoirs. \n \n(ii)  Drainage Rehabilitation in Srinagar ($13.8 million). Bemina and other areas towards \nthe north of the Srinagar city were swamps, which were reclaimed in the 1980\u2019s to \nprovide housing to migrants. Prior to development, storm water was soaked up by \nthe  swamps,  which  have  no  outlet  now  that  the  areas  have  been  developed, \nresulting in cesspools and flooding throughout the year. In the Bemina drainage \ndistrict,  more  severely  affected  areas  were  identified  and  a  subproject  was \nformulated to drain the flow into large existing drains along the National Highway, ", "  Appendix 3  37\nthrough underground drains and 6 pump stations.  The second subproject envisages \nimproving the performance of 45 of the 83 pumping stations spread throughout the \ncity by replacement of old/under capacity pumps, provision of generators for power \nback-up  (important,  since  power  failure  occurs  during  floods,  exacerbating  the \nsituation), improving electrical systems, piping and construction of pump houses \nwhich currently consists of temporary structures. Provision of garbage collection and \ndrain cleaning equipment will help keep the main drains un-blocked and is included \nin this subproject.  \n \n(iii)  Water Supply Rehabilitation in Jammu ($59.1 million). The envisaged sub projects \ninclude: (a) rehabilitation of the Sitlee water supply scheme to serve settlements on \nthe west side of the Tawi River, where a large proportion of the new migrants have \nsettled; (b) 9 different subprojects to rehabilitate existing city water supply systems; \nand (c) a subproject for provision of water tankers to provide immediate relief to the \npopulation currently not served by piped or ground water.      \n \n(iv)  Drainage Rehabilitation in Jammu ($24.3 million). Seven different subprojects for \nrestoration of drain linings, widening, re-grading and covering selected portions of \nthe drains.  Provision of garbage and drain cleaning equipment, will help in keeping \nthe main drains unblocked and is included in these subprojects.  \n \n12.  From  the  proposed  list  of  subprojects,  two  sample  subprojects  were  identified  and \nanalyzed with reference to ADB\u2019s Water Policy and safeguard policies relating to economic and \nfinancial analysis, environment and social aspects.  \n \nC.   Water Supply Sample Subproject \n \n13.  The water supply sample subproject (item (a) in para iii above) is located in the west and \nnorthwest areas of Jammu, on the west bank of the Tawi River. It would benefit the existing \npopulation of 530,000, living in an area of about 45 square kilometers (km2), about 31% of \nJammu\u2019s  total  urban  area.  The  subproject  will  rehabilitate  the  existing  Sitlee  water  supply \nsystem to meet the demands of the existing population, by restoring the system to its original \ncapacity. The areas covered by the proposed subproject are Keran, Chinor, Ban Talab, High \nCourt complex, Odheywala, Muthi, Barnai, Purkho, Roopnagar, Janipur, Patoli Mahgotrian, \nManda, Lohar and Sitlee. The majority of migrants who came into the city in the early 1990\u2019s \nsettled in these areas, including an estimated 165,000 poor people.  \n \n14.  The existing water distribution system built in the late 1970\u2019s to early 1980\u2019s includes \n67,250 domestic and 967 commercial connections. In addition there are 750 public stand posts \n(PSP) and  approximately 20,000 unauthorized connections within the subproject area. But \nbecause of the poor condition of the water system many of these serviced homes, especially in \nthe higher elevations, do not get regular water service. Because of the major influx of migrants \nin  the  early  1990\u2019s  there  are  now  an  estimated  106,000  homes  in  the  area,  including \napproximately 38,000 new houses occupied by the more recently arrived migrants, who have \nbuilt on empty lots throughout the area and on the fringes, basically infilling. But by the time they \narrived, the water supply system had already deteriorated due to lack of maintenance, and there \nwas  either no  water  service  or  only  sporadic  supply  in  much  of  these  infill  areas.  So  an \nestimated 20,000 of these new residents, did not join the system, to save the connection fee \nand the monthly service charge, though in most cases the street mains run in front of, or near \nby, their properties. These homes depend on intermittent tanker service. But in some areas, the \nstreets are narrow and steep and not always accessible by the tankers, especially in inclement \nweather. Therefore they carry water from the nearest PSPs. In addition, there are 8,700 homes ", "38    Appendix 3 \nin the lower reaches, that are supplied regularly through tankers by PHED, and a further 2,000 \nhave access to PSPs in their lanes. There are a further 3,000 homes which have access to \nneither the distribution system nor tankers.  \n \n15.  The existing water supply for this area of Jammu was completed by about 1982. It \nconsists of the Sitlee system including the intake from the Tawi River, the water treatment plant \n(WTP), raw and treated water pump stations, feeder mains, and the distribution system. The \ninstalled capacity is 65 million liters per day (mld), however the current output is only 39 mld. \nThe losses are due to lack of preventative maintenance to replace worn parts (mechanical \nsystems should be replaced every 7-10 years), so the intake and high lift pumps are worn out, \nwith only half operating at poor efficiency. In the WTP, chemical feeders and other mechanical \nsystems are in run down condition, and the filters, which are the key component limiting output \nand quality, are poorly maintained, with partially plugged filter sand. In addition the 30 year old \nfeeder mains to the balancing reservoirs in the service area, are leaking due to corrosion and \npoorly installed joints and service connections, made worse by partial blockages in the pipes \ndue to build up of solids, as there has been no cleaning done. PHED have constructed water \nfeeder mains from Jammu\u2019s main  water system to try and bring more water to the area. \nHowever, this has been only partially successful since the feeder mains and many distribution \nmains are in such poor condition that increasing the pressure just causes more leakage, with \nlittle increase in supply. \n \n16.  The proposed subproject would rehabilitate the existing Sitlee water supply system by \nreplacing most mechanical, and some electrical, equipment in the WTP, replace the filter sand \nwith high rate multimedia, replace the raw and treated water pumps, and modernize all control \nsystems. This will increase the capacity of the WTP to 73 mld, taking advantage of the usual \ninbuilt 15% extra design capacity, at basically no additional cost, as compared to bringing it \nback to the original design capacity of 65 mld. A second part of this rehabilitation is replacement \nof the 400mm feeder main from the WTP to the balancing reservoirs in the service areas, and \nthe more obviously leaking supply mains, so that the increased pressure from the rehabilitated \npumping system does not cause increased leakage. System metering would also be included, \nto start building a better database for major expansion in the proposed follow-on project. The \nestimated cost of this rehabilitation is about $7.9 million. The resultant increase in supply will \nenable more supply to the current connections.  \n \n17.   While system metering is planned in the Project, the State has committed to introduce \nmetering of commercial connections and doubling the water tariffs for all consumers by 2006. \nThe State is also committed to introduce domestic supply metering as part of the follow-on \nurban  project,  which  will  expand  the  water  supply,  to  enable  connection  of  the  currently \nunserved  households.  Extensive  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder  consultations  and  capacity \nbuilding of the PHED are proposed to be included in the PPTA proposed for the follow on \nproject. Even after doubling the tariff, it will not cover the cost of producing the water, meaning \nthat the small diameter connections will need to be subsidized, from larger connections. In order \nto set the right climate for introduction of meters, which has not been possible in on going urban \nprojects in India, the larger commercial, wealthy and middle class homes must be metered first, \nor at least in conjunction with the low income areas. \n \n18.  The subproject will also include a pilot program on cost-effective sanitation system which \nwill provide permanent, good quality, low cost private and community toilet units in the  refugee \nsettlements areas west of the Tawi River. The pilot will adopt a participatory approach to \nsanitation through partnership between the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), implementing \nNGOs and the beneficiary communities.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  39\n19.  The  ERA  will  finalize  the  basic  framework  for  implementing  the  scheme,  provide \nfinances and enable adoption of a community-based approach to cost effective sanitation. The \nNGOs contracted by the Project, and the beneficiary communities will play a proactive role in \nplanning, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance of the toilet blocks. NGOs will \nfacilitate direct beneficiary participation in planning, design, construction and operation and \nmaintenance  to  ensure  project  sustainability.  The  NGOs  will  build  awareness,  ownership, \ntechnical and organizational preparedness, and willingness to use and pay for the new facilities \namong the beneficiary groups. They will undertake necessary training and capacity building \nactivities  for  sustainable  management  and  maintenance  of  the  assets.  Women  would  be \nmobilized to play a leading role in the design and implementation of the program. \n \nD.   Storm Water Drainage Sample Subproject  \n \n20.  The flood affected Talab Tillo area (223 hectares), situated on the west bank of the Tawi \nRiver has a population of 68,000 (2001 census), including 30% migrants. Water supply to the \narea is from tube wells and a sewerage scheme is under implementation, using the State\u2019s own \nfunds, but progress is slow, and this work may have to be completed under the proposed follow-\non urban project. Presently many of the houses have septic tanks and some discharge directly \ninto  local  drains.  Conditions  in  the  drains  are  therefore  unhygienic,  which  is  made  worse \nbecause people also dump garbage into the open drains. The threats to public health are \nexacerbated due to the poor condition of the drains, as the municipal corporation is unable to \ncarryout adequate maintenance, due to lack of funds.  \n \n21.  Part of the drains are lined, but Urban Environment Engineering Department (UEED) \ncould not complete lining of all the drains, due to inadequate budget. Existing drain linings have \nsuffered severe erosion, partially due to large boulders from hills upstream breaking and eroding \nthe linings. Design of drain lining improvements needs to consider this aspect, so as to minimize \nsuch erosion after rehabilitation. The design criteria for the sample subproject was based in part \non UEED\u2019s normal design criteria and Indian standards. The rational formula was used to \nestimate peak flow in the drain, including runoff coefficients to ensure self scour. A ten year \nreturn period (maximum storm intensity) was used. The adopted rainfall intensity of 33 mm/hour \nwill be verified with meteorological data during detailed design. Dry weather flow, including \noverflow from septic tanks, has been allowed for and in major drains, a dry weather flow \nchannel is provided to ensure self scouring hydraulic conditions. Free board, at maximum flow \nconditions, varies from 0.2 m to 0.5 m, based on the size of the drain.                                     \n \n22.  In summary the proposed subproject will rehabilitate 11.3 km of drains. The works will \ninclude covering selected stretches of drains to provide better access to houses, repair of \nexisting drain lining, new lining of drains and four road crossings. The estimated cost of the \nsubproject is $2.1million. \n          \nE.   Cost Estimate \n \n23.  The total estimated cost of the subprojects proposed under the urban component is \n$123.8 million. All the estimates were prepared based on the prevailing market rates. Table 1 \nsummarizes the costs for each sub-sector.  ", "40    Appendix 3 \nTable 1.

Implementation Arrangement \n \n24.   The subprojects will be implemented under the EA (ERA) through the PMU, supported \nby the PMC, and the Project Implementation Units located in Jammu and Kashmir, supported by \nthe DSC (See Appendix 6 for the organogram of the Project). \n   \nG.   Procurement \n \n25.  The procurement of civil works will be done largely through local competitive bidding \n(LCB) procedure following ADB\u2019s guidelines using the standard bidding documents. The goods \nwill be procured following international competitive bidding/international shopping in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s standard procedures. \n \nH.   Sustainability and Operation & Maintenance \n \n26.  The PHED is the agency responsible for O&M of water supply systems, the UEED for \nsewerage, and respective Municipal Corporations for drains and solid waste management. The \nState  government  is  committed  to  provide  necessary  budget  for  maintenance  of  the \nrehabilitated assets. The capacity building component of the Project includes training of line \ndepartment personnel in O&M practices as per the manuals developed by the PMC/DSCs. \n \n27.   Presently water charges are based on a flat rate, with the small diameter connections, \ncommon  for  low  income  households,  paying  only  Rs15  per  month,  while  larger  diameter \nconnections, normally associated with middle and higher income groups, pay Rs28 per month. \nMetering of domestic connections is not proposed in this Project, but will be taken up in the \nfollow-up urban project. In terms of cost recovery, a tariff increase from Rs15 to Rs30 for lower \nincome  small  diameter  connections  group  and  Rs28  to  Rs60  for  larger  higher  diameter \nconnections income group is proposed to be made effective by April 2005 at latest by June \n2005, with 10.5% annual increase in real terms thereafter. This is expected to be sufficient to \nmeet the O&M costs, as the cost of producing and pumping water on a unit basis, after \nrehabilitation, will be lower, due to the increased efficiencies of pumps and the almost doubling \nof the water supply due to lower leakage combined with the almost doubling of the water supply. \nThe PPTA for the follow-up urban loan, which focuses on expansion of the utilities and service \nlevels, will address these issues in detail including metering and incremental quantity based \ntariff system.   \n \nI.   Implementation Schedule \n \n28.  The Project is to be implemented over a period of four years. The project implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. ", "  Appendix 4  41\nTRANSPORT SECTOR COMPONENT \n \nA.  Sector Background \n \n1.  Roads  have  been  and  will  continue  to  be  critical  to  the  transport  connectivity \nthroughout the State. The State has a relatively extensive road network, totaling 29,014 km, \nof which 823 km are national highways. The responsibility for development of these roads is \nvested with Ministry of Road Transport and Highways/National Highway Authority of India, \nwhile its maintenance is largely entrusted to Border Roads Organization (BRO).  The State \nPublic Works Department (PWD) \u2013 Roads and Buildings (R&B) Division \u2013 is responsible for \nstate roads, major district roads and other district roads, the latter of which are rural roads in \nnature.  PWD covers 14,858 km of network, of which 5,082 km are in Jammu region, 7,984 \nkm are in Kashmir region, and 1,792 km in Ladakh region.  Of the total, 12,109 km is \nsurfaced (black topped, metalled and shingled) and 2,749 km un-surfaced (fair weather and \njeepable).    One  chief  engineer  is  assigned  for  Kashmir  Province,  while  another  chief \nengineer is assigned for Jammu area.  The Project would focus on those road systems \nfalling under the jurisdiction of PWD. \n \n2.  In  addition,  Forest  Department  and  Rural  Development  Departments  are  also \ninvolved in road development and maintenance. It covers 13,660 km of roads, of which \n1,901 km is surfaced and 11,759 km un-surfaced.  The major arterial urban roads fall under \nthe  jurisdiction  of  State  PWD  and  the  remaining  under  the  jurisdiction  of  Municipal \nCorporations.  \n \n3.  Over the last 15 years there has been extensive deterioration and damage to the \nroad network in J&K particularly bridges, both major and minor. The paucity of funds for \nrehabilitation and maintenance transportation, coupled with the law and order problem, has \nresulted in poor condition of the roads. High transportation costs and poor connectivity are a \nmajor problem in the road network in J&K. A number of state roads and district/rural roads \nare not passable during the rainy season, causing major problems for local farmers who \nneed to get their products to nearby markets. Many of the bridges are in a poor condition, \nwhich are accessible only to light vehicles and pedestrians. The road network has some \nmissing links across the river, where the traffic movement can take place over the riverbed \nduring the dry season.   \n \n4.  Traffic on roads has increased by more than 2 \u00bd times as against a 1 \u00bc increase in \nthe road network during 1989-2000, which has resulted in increased traffic congestion. In \naddition, other J&K specific problems such as frequent landslides, narrow roads, difficult \nterrain, soil conditions, short working season and cold weather adds to the problem of road \nmaintenance in the State. The roads in the higher altitudes are particularly affected by \nsnowfall during January to March each year. On the onset of summer season from April, the \nsnow  melts  and  the  water  ingresses  into  the  pavement  layers  through  cracks  causing \ndamage. \n \n5.  To  cope  with  the  problems,  several  road  improvement  programs  are  being \nundertaken with use of central Government resources. Most important are the four laning of \nnational highway between Jammu and Srinagar and the Srinagar Bypass, both of which are \nbeing  carried  out  under  National  Highway  Development  Project  (NHDP).  Rural  road \nnetworks are also being upgraded under the Prime Minister's Rural Road Program.  In the \nwake of the State Government\u2019s inability to provide the financial resources required to \ndevelop and maintain rural infrastructure, loans have been raised from the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) as a major supplement to State plan. The \nNABARD  assistance  received  by  the  R&B  Division  of  PWD  under  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Fund (RIDF) is meant for upgradation of roads in rural areas. Since 1998 \nNABARD has approved about Rs5,700 million ($125 million equivalent) for upgradation of ", "42       Appendix 4 \nrural roads in the State. While the State Government &K also receives funds for state \nhighways from the Central Road Fund (CRF), it is far from adequate to cover the enormous \nrehabilitation needs of state/district road networks. It is evident that state and rural roads \nunder the jurisdiction of PWD are the least funded segment among all segments. \n \n6.  O&M is a critical element for securing the sustainability of the state road network, but \nPWD has never received adequate funds from the State Government.  While $52 million per \nyear is required for adequate O&M, PWD has been receiving only about 14% of this amount.  \nIn  view  of  the  importance  of  O&M,  the  Project  has  incorporated  advisory  services  for \nestablishing a road maintenance system/model, establishing a road database, and provision \nof necessary training on the concept of asset management.  \n \n7.  The maintenance and rehabilitation works are entrusted to the local contractors in the \nstate by the PWD. The average value of the rehabilitation works is generally not more than \n$1 million. The average value of the maintenance works would be even less than $0.1 \nmillion. In view of the small works being carried out in the state, the state\u2019s local construction \nindustry  is  not  well  developed.  An  exception  to  this  is  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Projects \nConstruction  Corporation  Ltd.  (J&KPCC),  a  government  owned  company  that  has \nundertaken substantial civil works in the state and possesses adequate capacity to carry out \nbridge rehabilitation and construction. \n \n8.  During the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996/97-200/02), PWD has placed major focus on the \nconstruction/rehabilitation of bridges and culverts and other public assets, the provision of \nconnectivity to isolated villages to nearest road network and the completion of schemes that \nhad been left unfinished from the earlier plans.  The 10th Five-Year plan (2002/03-2006/07) \nstressed the importance of expanding road systems so as to cope with the increased needs \ndue to the expansion of the urban areas, particularly in Srinagar and Jammu.  The Plan has \nalso emphasized the importance of reconstructing damaged major bridges (109) and minor \nbridges (128).  Rural roads are now also given priority among all road segments after the \ngeneral election of May 2004.  \n \nB.  Objective and Scope of the Component  \n \n9.  Department  of  Planning  (DOP),  whose  responsibilities  for  the  Project  are  now \nhanded  over  to  Economic  Reconstruction  Agency  (ERA),  has  received  a  number  of \ncandidate subprojects from 14 districts.  DOP/ERA is in a process of prioritizing these to \nachieve a balanced development across the state. The subprojects to be taken up under the \nProject  include  rehabilitation/reconstruction  of  about  80  damaged,  weak  and  missing \nbridges, rehabilitation of about 1,500 km of state roads, major district roads, other district \nroads and village roads. The Project will also fund the procurement of equipment needed for \noperation of a maintenance management system and also for maintenance.  \n \n10.  Among  the  various  subprojects,  three  sample  subprojects  were  chosen:  (i) \nQuazikund-Kulgam road of a length of 16.5 km in Ananthnag district; (ii) Raithan-Palmaidan-\nArizol road of a length of 14.1 km in Budgam district; and (iii) Kannikadal bridge of a total \nlength of 31 meter in Srinagar. These subprojects represent characteristics of the road and \nbridge subprojects to be financed under the proposed Project. Brief particulars of the sample \nsubprojects are as below: \n \n(i)  Quazikund-Kulgam  road:  The  road  is  an  Other  District  Road  (ODR)  in \nAnanthnag  district.  The  existing  road  is  generally  having  a  gravel \n(WBM/Stone base) surface. The surface is highly distressed with raveled \nstone surface, loss of camber, edge fretting and depressions. The road \nstretch has several locations with deficient turns and steep gradient. The \nroad reported to be a shorter link for traffic moving towards Jammu from ", "  Appendix 4  43\nShopiyan. The salient features of the improvement works are rehabilitation \nand widening of the existing single lane carriageway to an intermediate lane \n(one half lane) with paved shoulders, construction of roadside drainage and \nrehabilitation/reconstruction of minor bridges and cross drainage structures. \nAdequate road safety measures will be provided through construction of \nguardrails on a raised footpath to separate roadside settlements from the \nmain carriageway. The improvement will include a provision of a bituminous \nsurfacing comprising 50 mm thick bituminous macadam and a 20 mm thick \npremix carpet with liquid seal coat.  \n \n(ii)  Raithan-Palmaidan-Arizol road: The road is an Other District Road (ODR) in \nBudagm district. The existing road is generally having a gravel (WBM/Stone \nbase) surface. The riding quality of the gravel road is poor with undulating \nand raveled surface. The road stretch has several locations with deficient \nturns and steep gradient. The salient features of the improvement works are \nrehabilitation of the existing single lane carriageway and construction of \npaved  shoulders,  construction  of  roadside  drainage  and \nrehabilitation/reconstruction  of  bridges  and  cross  drainage  structures. \nAdequate road safety measures will be provided through construction of \nguardrails on a raised footpath to separate roadside settlements from the \nmain carriageway. The improvement will include a provision of a bituminous \nsurfacing comprising 50 mm thick bituminous macadam and a 20 mm thick \npremix carpet with liquid seal coat.  \n \n(iii)  Kannikadal bridge: The existing Kannaikadal bridge is located on the road \nlink connecting Chota Bazar Chowk and New Habba Kadal Bridge (which \nare currently in two lane stardard). The existing timber bridge of two lane \nstandard  is  currently  catering  only  to  light  vehicles\u2013  mostly  cars,  three \nwheelers,  bicycles  and  pedestrians.  The  improvement  envisages  the \nreplacement of the existing bridge with a permanent bridge of a two-lane \ncarriageway width and footpath for pedestrian movement.  \n \n11.  The ADB mission appraised and found that these three sample subprojects are \nviable in light of technical, economic, environmental and social criteria.         \n \n12.  In  the  selection  of  the  remaining  subprojects,  priority  would  be  given  to:  (i) \nreconstruction and/or rehabilitation of damaged and/or deteriorated infrastructure facilities; \n(ii) completion of undertakings which had started earlier, but stalled or slowed down later due \nthe deteriorated law and order situation; (iii) provision of the minimum level of infrastructure \nservices  to  cater  to  the  needs  of  migrants/refugees;  and  (iv)  provision  of  minimum \nconnectivity to rural communities which have deprived of necessary access to administrative \nservices and markets. \n \n13.  All investments are expected to meet eligibility criteria of no major environmental \nimpact,  no  land  acquisition  (except  for  minor  ones  necessitated  by  engineering, \nenvironmental and social reasons), and no major resettlement (see Appendix 2 for the \neligibility criteria of subprojects). \n \n14.  The design and supervision consultants will assist GoJK for the preparation of the \npotential subprojects and the project management consultants will assist in the appraisal and \nof  those  subprojects.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n16.  ERA will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. It will establish the Project \nManagement Unit (PMU), headed by the Project Director (in this case, Chief Executive \nOfficer  of  ERA),  and  comprised  of  three  deputy  directors,  one  each  for  financial \nmanagement, urban and roads; one procurement officer, environmental specialist; social \ndevelopment/resettlement  officer;  training  coordinator;  and  support  staff.    PMU  would \nprovide overall coordination of PIUs.  \n \n17.  The PMU will be supported by the PMC, which will provide expertise in subproject \nappraisal, due diligence, project management, approval of designs, bid documents, bid \nevaluation reports and preparation of quarterly and annual progress reports.   \n \n18.  The road works in Component C will be implemented through PIUs to be established \nfor each of Jammu and Kashmir regions. Each PIU, headed by a Project Manager (PM), will \ncomprise professional and support staff who will be assisted by the design & supervision \nconsultants  (DSC)  in  selection  of  subprojects,  development  of  subproject  including \npreliminary designs and design review, preparation of tender documents, bid evaluation, \nproject implementation including construction supervision and quality and quantity control. \nThe PIUs will include engineers from the PWD who will coordinate project preparation and \nimplementation of the subprojects in the road sector. The PIUs will have its field offices in all \nthe districts where subprojects will be implemented. The PMC and DSCs will be recruited \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \nE.  Procurement  \n \n19.  All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The subprojects included in the indicative list are \nspread among 14 districts across the regions of Jammu and Kashmir. The estimated cost of \nmost of the road subprojects is about $1.5 million and bridge subcomponent is $0.5 million. \nThe experience of both PWD and local contractors over the past 10-15 years is limited to the \nsmall road rehabilitation works. As result, the local contracting industry does not have the \nequipment, financial capacity or experience to carry out large contracts. Because of this \nlimitation, the small construction works would be packaged into larger packages under ", "  Appendix 4  45\n\u201cdesign as you build\u201d concept, where detailed design and construction would be carried out \nby the contractor in a phased manner.  While packages will be finalized with ADB\u2019s prior \napproval  during  project  implementation,  a  principle  is  to  generally  formulate  contract \npackages on a district by district basis. The contract packages will be formulated taking into \nconsideration  the  proximity  of  road  sections  and  the  scheduling  of  subproject \nimplementation.  \n \n20.  Bridge subcomponent entails a large number of small works (each of which costs \naround $0.2-$1.0 million), many of which are located in remote areas in the State (scattered \nin 12 districts). J&K Project Construction Corporation (J&KPCC) has been an implementing \nagency for the State Government in carrying out the construction of bridges and taking up \nbridge works abandoned by the private contractors. In view of the size of the works and their \nlocation, the  construction  of  small  bridges  whose  size  is  less  than  $0.5  million  will  be \nentrusted to J&KPCC on a force-account basis. \n \n21.  Contract packaging for equipment will be based on required technical features and \ntiming of the need for the equipment. Detailed specifications will be finalized during Project \nimplementation. \n \nF.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n22.   PWD is responsible for the maintenance of roads. Works are generally entrusted to \nthe local state contractors. In spite of the required amount of $52 million per year, PWD has \nbeen receiving only 14% of this requirement. In view of small value of road rehabilitation and \nmaintenance works being carried out in the state, the state's local contracting industry is not \nwell developed and not equipped and experienced. O&M is a critical element for securing \nthe  sustainability  of  the  state  road  network.  To  ensure  sustainability  of  the  road \nimprovements several measures will be initiated under the project. In order to initiate a \nsystem-wide  maintenance,  assistance  would  be  provided  under  the  project  for  the \nsystematic  collection  of  road  condition  data,  establishing  a  road  database  and  a  road \nmaintenance  system/model,  purchase  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  updating  of \nmaintenance manual, training on the concept of road asset management, road maintenance \nsystem and practices. The road sections proposed for improvement under the project are \nlargely rural roads and do not carry substantial traffic to justify levy of direct user charges \nsuch as tolls. A study on the financing and implementation mechanisms for O&M would be \nundertaken  by  PMC,  which  would  provide  a  basis  for  a  policy  dialogue  with  the  state \ngovernment. The State has provided assurance for adequate budgetary support to cover \nmaintenance cost of the roads and bridges rehabilitated under the Project.  \n     \nG.  Implementation Schedule \n \n23.  The Project will be implemented over a period of four years through June 2009. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  To minimize start-up delays, the State has \nrequested ADB for help with preparation of the next priority subprojects to be taken up in first \nyear, training for the staff of the PMU and PIUs, recruitment of PMC and DSCs, and, \nestablishing  procedures  for  project  accounts  and  disbursements,  through  consultants \nprovided under a transitional technical assistance.  \n ", " 46         Appendix 5\nCOST ESTIMATES\nComponent FX Local Total FX(%) ADB Govt\nComponent A: Rehabilitation of Urban Infrastructure\nRehabilitation of Water Supply in Jammu\nCivil Works 3.8 12.0 15.8 24.0 12.6 3.2\nEquipment and Materials 26.4 8.7 35.1 75.2 33.0 2.1\nRehabilitation of Water Supply in Srinagar\nCivil Works 3.9 12.4 16.3 24.0 13.1 3.3\nEquipment and Materials 5.1 1.7 6.8 75.2 6.4 0.4\nRehabilitation of Drainage system in Jammu\nCivil Works 4.8 15.0 19.8 24.0 15.8 4.0\nEquipment and Materials 1.2 0.4 1.5 75.2 1.4 0.1\nRehabilitation of Drainage system in Srinagar\nCivil Works 1.2 3.7 4.9 24.0 3.9 1.0\nEquipment and Materials 5.2 1.7 7.0 75.2 6.6 0.4\nTaxes and Duties 0.0 16.6 16.6 0.0 0.0 16.6\nSub-total Component A 51.5 72.3 123.8 41.6 92.8 31.0\nComponent B: Rehabilitation of Roads and Bridges\nRehabilitation of Roads and Bridges\nCivil Works 87.9 71.7 159.6 55.1 133.0 26.7\nEquipment and Materials 3.6 1.2 4.8 75.2 4.6 0.3\nTaxes and Duties 0.0 22.6 22.6 0.0 0.0 22.6\nSub-total Component B 91.5 95.6 187.1 48.9 137.5 49.6\nComponent C: Capacity Building Support and Implementation Assistance\nProject management Supportt 0.6 5.0 5.6 10.7 5.6 0.0\nDesign and Construction Supervision Support 0.0 8.7 8.7 0.0 8.7 0.0\nEquipmment and vehicle for Implementation & Incremental Administration 0.0 5.0 5.0 0.0 4.5 0.5\nTraining on Project Management and O&M  0.0 0.9 0.9 0.0 0.9 0.0\nTaxes and Duties 0.0 3.6 3.6 0.0 0.0 3.6\nSub-total Component C 0.6 23.1 23.7 2.5 19.7 4.0\nTotal Costs 143.6 191.0 334.6 42.9 250.0 84.6\nInterest During Construction and Commitment Charges 23.4 0.0 23.4 100.0 0.0 23.4\nTotal Project Costs 167.0 191.0 358.0 46.7 250.0 108.0\nNote:  IDC has been calculated on the basis of fixed swap rate for five years i.e. 3.64% and with lending spread of ADB i.e. 0.4%", " PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS\nGovernment of India\nProject Steering\nAsian Development Bank\n(ADB) Government of  Committee\nProject Steering Committee\nJammu & Kashmir\nHeaded by Chief Executive Officer\nCommisioners/ Secretaries of \nEconomic Reconstruction Agency (ERA) Departments of: (a) Public Works;

Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector/sub sector to reduce poverty in DMC - India: \n \nThe Project is primarily designed for restoring essential infrastructure services in transport and urban sectors that were \ndeteriorated due to the prolonged destruction of infrastructure facilities and general neglect of maintenance.  It would \ncontribute to the improvement of living conditions of urban population in Jammu and Srinagar cities, including those \nwho have migrated to the peripheries of those cities over the last fifteen years and settled there with virtually no access \nto minimum level of urban services.  The provision of adequate road infrastructure will improve transport of goods within \nand between states and serve rural communities with necessary mobility and access to markets and administrative \nservices thereby stimulating economic growth. The provision of basic urban infrastructure will help to keep pace with \nthe continued urbanization pressure and would promote both social and economic development and support pro-poor \ngrowth. \n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                                      Classification: Others     \n \nJammu and Kashmir ranks 6th in area wise and 17th in population among the States and Union Territories of India. The \nState consists of 14 districts, with 3 municipalities, 54 towns and notified area committee, 6,477 inhabited villages and \n281 uninhabited villages. The National Human Development Report (NHDR) of 2001, prepared by the Planning \nCommission, Government of India indicated that, the population below poverty line (BPL) for the year 1993\u201394 was \n30.34% in rural areas and 9.18% in the urban areas. A survey undertaken as part of the socioeconomic study for the \nProject found that 31.35% of the total sample households are living below the poverty line in the two subproject districts \nof Anantnag and Budgam, two representative districts in the State. If the findings of two districts are compared with the \npoverty data quoted in NHDR for the year 1993-94 it can be implied that the poverty scenario within the State has \nremained the same during last 10 years with a large population continuing to live below the poverty line. Five sample \nsubprojects out of 150-200 likely possible subprojects have been appraised.  \n \nUrban Component: \n \nThe right side of the Tawi River has the largest concentration of migrants in Jammu. The sample subproject is intended \nto replace the tanker and public stand post based water supply by piped water system and will benefit 530,000 people, \nof which 180,000 are migrants. A large percentage of these migrants are low-income and poor (13.6%) households \nliving below poverty line mostly deriving their livelihoods as wage labors. These migrants are served with tanker and \npublic stand posts. Availability of portable water at an affordable tariff will improve their quality of life. The improved \nlevels of water delivery and accessibility will reduce overall time taken for water collection and need for storage \nespecially benefiting poor women. While consumers presently connected to PHED piped water supply will benefit from \nincreased quantity of water and saving on expenses incurred on other sources, households with new connections will \nbenefit from cost savings on water by switching from tanker and community supply sources to piped individual supply. \nThe access to clean drinking water will reduce instances of waterborne diseases, contribute towards improved health \nstatus of the project communities and reduce environmental health costs.  \n \nThe Talab Tillo storm water drainage sample subproject will benefit a population of 68,000, out of which 19% are poor \nhouseholds. Nearly 15-20% of the local population, including poor households, are severely affected by seasonal floods \nand on an average incur an expense of Rs300 per year for house repair works.  As a result of implementation of this \nscheme, poor households will be benefited with an incremental increase in land value of the area as well as cost \nsavings on account of flood mitigation, cleaning of drains and medical expenses on account of water borne diseases. \n \nIn terms of immediate poverty reduction impacts, the urban component will provide employment of nearly 340,000 man-\ndays of jobs of unskilled labor benefiting the poor population in the area. The augmentation of water supply and \ndrainage facilities will contribute to overall direct benefits in terms of sustained improvements in basic service provision \nin Jammu. Indirect benefits will be available to residents of the city, through improved living conditions, a healthier living \nenvironment and the prospect of improved health status especially for poor households. \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                        Appendix 9   51\nRoads & Bridges Component: \n \nThe two sample roads subprojects in the districts of Anantnag and Budgam, passing through 24 villages, will benefit a \ntotal population of 67,311 with nearly 31.35% households living below poverty line and the number of BPL families \nbeing more concentrated in Budgam district (61%). The social assessment revealed that majority of the households in \nthe project influence area derived their livelihoods from agriculture, allied agricultural activities and as wage labor. The \nimproved road would enable the rural population, including poor households\u2019 easy access to essential socio-economic \nservices such as basic medical care, education, administrative services and markets. The two sample roads pass \nthrough agricultural areas and as major proportion of beneficiaries are farmers, the improved transport linkages would \nreduce dependence of cultivators on local markets and expand market options for sale of agricultural produce. The \nimproved project roads would also help timely supply of agricultural produce and perishables to demand areas thereby \nbenefiting both poor and no-poor farmers. Better road condition will especially improve access of the poor farmers to \nthe distant markets where higher prices are available for their produce. In addition, the marketing of such high value \nperishable products such as fruits would receive a further boost on a commercial basis, with more farmers investing in \nthem, thereby potentially increasing annual incomes of farmers. As a sizeable number of the project population derive \ntheir livelihood from wage labor (agricultural and non-agricultural) it is expected that the improved connectivity would \nprovide many of them with increased opportunities to access higher-paid, non-agricultural work, thereby improving their \nincome levels and quality of life. Overall connectivity would increase investments in non-agricultural micro-enterprises \nand larger investments in transport services. One of the immediate benefits of the project for the laborers would be in \nterms of labor opportunities in the road construction work and maintenance thereafter.  \n \n \nC.         Participation Process   \n \nDuring project preparation, discussion sessions, interviews and small group meetings were conducted with the Project \ncommunities in the sample subproject districts of Anantnag and Budgam with the objective of ascertaining their \nresponse to the Project, their needs and demands from the project, an estimate of losses, if any that they might suffer \nand steps to mitigate the same. These interviews, group meetings were held in groups comprising of men, women, \nfarmers, indigenous people as well as other backward classes to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the Project \nas well as its impacts. The Project beneficiaries were unanimous in their desire for the project to proceed, and keenly \naware of its prospective benefits to them.  \n \n \nD.   Gender and Development \n \nThe improved levels of water supply and accessibility will reduce time, cost and work burden for water collection and \nstorage, benefiting women, particularly poor women. Availability of clean drinking water and improved drainage facilities \nwill decrease the instances of waterborne diseases, thus reducing poor women\u2019s health care burden associated with \ncleaning and family health care and also contributing towards improved health status and overall hygiene in the area. \nThe road component of the Project will provide both men and women and offer special benefits to women by increasing \nthe access to higher levels of health care outside the village. \n \nE.

Introduction \n \n1.  Based on the discussions between the Government of India and Asian Development \nBank (ADB), it was agreed to consider the provision of a loan for the investment in the state \nof Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). The proposed Project in the State of J&K would aim at \nrehabilitation of social infrastructure facilities including roads and bridges, water supply and \nother urban facilities, which have deteriorated or been damaged over the last 15 years of \nconflict in the state. In this regard, Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project in J&K is proposed to \nbe undertaken in the state.  The proposed Project primarily covers two components, namely, \n(i) Roads and bridges, including upgrading of state, urban rural roads, and rehabilitation \nand/or reconstruction of bridges and  (ii) Urban Infrastructure, including repair, upgrading \nand completion of water supply, drainage and the purchase of garbage/drainage clearing \nequipment.  \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement in Sample Subprojects \n \n2.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s procedure for sector lending, sample subprojects have \nbeen selected in the provinces of Srinagar & Jammu for project preparation and processing. \nOut of these subprojects, the road and bridges subprojects have been identified in Srinagar \nProvince and includes upgradation of Quazigund \u2013 Kulgam Road (16.5 km), Raithan \u2013 \nPalmaidan  Arizal  road  (14.1  Km)  and  Kanikadal  bridge  (31  km).  Under  the  urban \ninfrastructure component, two sample subprojects namely Water supply and Storm water \ndrainage, both in the Jammu city, have been selected.  The projects include (i) Right Bank \nTawi Water Supply Scheme and (ii) Talab Tilo Drainage Scheme in Jammu City. \n \n3. As the Project entails rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure in the State, the sample \nsubprojects under both the Components primarily involves up-gradation and revamping of \nthe existing facilities wherein the land acquisition and resettlement impacts will be minimal. \nUnder the  Roads & Bridges Component the resettlement impact has been avoided by \nadopting most feasible design option. In case of the Kanni Kadal Bridge in Srinagar, it is \nnoted that a project-associated approach road is being constructed by the Government of \nJ&K through its own domestic funds, under a separate Project. Since the construction of \nthese approach roads is interlinked with the bridge construction, the EA will probe further & \nassess the resettlement impacts of the approach road once the preliminary designs for this \nProject have been prepared. Based on this, Resettlement Plan will be prepared by the EA, \nas per the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NPRR) 2004, and ADB Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement as laid down in this framework. The EA shall submit the RP to \nADB for approval, prior to the award of civil contracts. In case of the urban infrastructure \nsample subproject, construction of the two reservoirs and pumping station would not entail \nany land acquisition as the land in case of pumping station is already available to the \ngovernment and is free of any encumbrances or encroachments. However, laying pipelines \nand construction of drainage might lead to temporary disruptions and losses, the exact \nextent of which can only be measured at the detailed design stage.  \n \n4.  This Resettlement Framework has been prepared for use in all subprojects, including \nsample subprojects, where the exact impact can only be measured at detailed design and \nfor additional subprojects as required under ADB policy for sector lending. It outlines the \nobjectives, policy principles and procedures for acquisition of land, if any, compensation and \nother assistance measures for affected persons, if any, and procedures for preparation of \nadditional subprojects under the Loan. Economic Reconstruction Agency (ERA) will be the \nExecuting Agency for the Project and will be responsible for preparing social analysis and \nresettlement plans for all subprojects, including sample subprojects (if required) as per this \nframework and submit to ADB for review and approval prior to contract award for each ", "54          Appendix 10 \n \n \nsubproject. Since the Project involves two sectors and several locations, there would be four \nProject Implementation Units, two each at Jammu (Urban and Roads) and Srinagar (Urban \nand Roads). The PIU (Urban) will implement the water supply and drainage components \nwhile the PIU (Roads/Bridge) will implement the roads and bridges components of the \nProject. PMU will oversee PIUs preparation and implementation of all resettlement plans for \nall subprojects under its responsibility. \n \nC.  Resettlement Policy and Framework \n \n5.  In  India,  compensation  for  land  acquisition  (LA)  and  resettlement  assistance  for \nproject-affected people is generally governed by the Land Acquisition Act (1894), which has \nbeen  amended  from  time  to  time.  The  State  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  holds  a  special \nconstitutional status under Article 370 of the Constitution of India.  The State has a separate \nConstitution promulgated in 1957.  The separate Constitution of the State and Article 370 of \nthe Constitution of India provide the State with much greater flexibility in managing its own \naffairs.  The most important characteristic is that the residual authority of political, economic \nand social legislation vest with the State Government and not with the Central Government \nConsequently, the land acquisition procedure in the State is governed by the State Land \nAcquisition (LA) Act, 1990. In J&K there is a unique system wherein each government line \ndepartment has their designated officer known as Collector \u2013 Land Acquisition (LA) of the \nrank of Assistant Commissioner, who has the authority to initiate action on LA which makes \nthe process simple and faster. The compensation under this process is given as per the \ncircle rate. However, the Act is inadequate to provide mitigation to many of the project-\nrelated affected persons in accordance with ADB policy.  \n \n6.  Following the state laws and regulation on land acquisition and incorporating ADB \npolicy on Policy on Involuntary Resettlement1 as well as the National Policy on Resettlement \nand  Rehabilitation  (NPRR)  which  was  approved  by  the  Government  of  India  (GOI)  in \nFebruary 2004, the basic principles for the Project will include these elements with respect to \neach  subproject,  including  sample  subprojects,  namely  (i)  as  a  matter  of  policy,  land \nacquisition, and other involuntary resettlement impacts would be minimized as much as \npossible; (ii) any land acquisition and/or resettlement will be carried out and compensation \nprovided in order to improve or at least restore the pre-Project income and living standards \nof the affected people; (iii) consultation with affected people on compensation options and \npreparation Resettlement Plan (RP) in accordance with this Framework; (iv) payment of \ncompensation  for  acquired  assets  at  market/replacement  rates;  (v)  payment  of \ncompensation for lost land, housing, assets and resettlement allowances in full prior to prior \nto the contractor taking physical acquisition of the land and prior to  the commencement of \nany construction activities; (vi) resettlement assistance to affected persons including non-\ntitled persons (e.g., informal dwellers/squatters, and encroachers) prior to the contractor \ntaking physical acquisition of the land and prior to the commencement of any construction \nactivities; (vii) income restoration and rehabilitation; and, (viii) special attention to vulnerable \ngroups. \n  \n7.  In the absence of a policy consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, \nthis Framework and resettlement procedural guidelines shall apply to all subprojects (sample \nas well as additional subprojects) under the Project so as to ensure that persons affected by \nland acquisition will be eligible for appropriate compensation and rehabilitation assistance.    \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement will prevail in case of any difference between such \npolicy and the State\u2019s laws and regulations \n \n                                                 \n1 Involuntary Resettlement, Asian Development Bank, Manila, 1995. \n \n \n   ", "                                                                                                    Appendix 10   55 \n8.  Regarding the eligibility of compensation, all affected people will be provided with \ncompensation and rehabilitation if their land is reduced, income source adversely affected, \nhouses partially or fully demolished, and other properties such as crops, trees and other \nfacilities or access to these properties will be reduced or damaged due to the Project \u2013 \nincluding during road/bridge construction or augmentation of water supply/drainage system. \nLack of legal documents of their customary rights of occupancy/titles shall not affect their \neligibility  for  compensation.  During  the  Project  implementation  stage  if  there  are  any \nchanges in the sample subproject design thereby adversely affecting the land, livelihood or \nother assets of the people, the same shall be compensated in keeping with this Framework. \n \n9.  Further, in case of land acquisition since land-for-land may not be a feasible option, \nthe Framework stipulates payment of compensation as per the assessed value of the land \nand structure to the affected persons (AP). In addition to compensation payments made by \nthe competent authority, the APs will receive additional assistance to match replacement \ncosts, which is the difference between the market value and the assessed value, if any, for \nlost assets (land and houses), transaction costs such as stamps/registration costs (in case of \npurchase of replacement land) and other cash grants and resettlement assistance such as \nshifting allowance, compensation for loss of workdays/income due to dislocation. Female-\nheaded households and other vulnerable households (such as ST/SC, disabled, elderly) will \nbe eligible for further cash assistance for relocation and house reconstruction.  \n \n10.  Income Restoration assistance shall also be made available to all those losing their \nmain source of livelihood as a result of the Project construction in the subprojects. The \nincome restoration strategy will focus on economic activities that will provide a sustained \nsource  of  income  over  a  longer  period  of  time  to  enable  restoration,  or  better  still, \nimprovements in APs' standard of living. A detailed inventory of losses will be made, based \non the different kinds of losses incurred by the APs. In addition, a detailed assessment of \nexisting skills will be made of the affected Persons, in keeping with which skill development \ninputs and trainings would be provided to them. Assistance will be provided for income \ngenerating  vocational  training  and  skill  upgradation  options,  including  starting  suitable \nproduction  or  service  activity  and  establishing  linkages  to  local  or  national  economic \ndevelopment and employment programs in the project area. The affected squatters shall be \nreorganized and relocated based on the severity of the impact. Enterprise development shall \nbe especially promoted amongst the APs so as to contribute towards a sustainable income \nrestoration opportunity to them.  \n \n11.  The Entitlement Matrix Table lists various types of losses, identification/eligibility and \nentitlements  and  provides  basic  parameters  for  preparation  of  compensation  and \n7 \nresettlement benefits. The matrix would apply to sample subprojects as well as additional \nsubprojects, based on the specific project impacts.  \n \nD.  Procedures for Resettlement Plan (RP) Preparation \n \n12.  Each additional subproject will be prepared, and the additional detailed design of \neach sample subprojects will be undertaken by the ERA in keeping with the following:  \n \n(i)  Social  impact  assessment  surveys  including  Census  survey  and  20%  socio-\neconomic survey of the APs will be carried out for each of the subprojects (for \nboth Roads & Bridges & Urban Infrastructure Components) based on preliminary \ntechnical designs;  \n \n(ii)  If impacts are found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d2 a full RP will be prepared for each \nsubproject for approval prior to award of contracts for that subproject; and  \n                                                 \n2  Source: Asian Development Bank Operations Manual \u2013Opertaional Procedure on Involuntary Resettlement  \n   ", "56          Appendix 10 \n \n \n \n(iii)  If subproject impacts are less than significant, a short RP will be prepared for that \nsubproject for approval prior to award of contracts for that subproject.  \n \n(iv)  The RP would also include measures to ensure that socio-economic condition, \nneeds  and  priorities  of  women  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage women.   \n \n13.  The Project Implementation Consultants for preparatory studies for all subprojects, \nincluding  the  transitional  TA  consultants  for  sample  subprojects,  should  include  expert \nresettlement specialist familiar with ADB policy and procedures for preparation of additional \nsubprojects RPs. The RPs must comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and \nother social safeguard guidelines. In case impacts on Indigenous People are identified, then \nan Indigenous People\u2019s Development Plan (IPDP) must be prepared in keeping with ADB \npolicy on Indigenous People and IPDP Framework. The ERA will submit the RPs to ADB for \napproval,  which  will  be  a  condition  for  contract  of  civil  work,  including  compensation \npayments prior to displacement.  \n \nE.  Institutional Responsibilities \n \n14.  Resettlement  Plan  will  include  adequate  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure \neffective and timely design, planning, consultation, and implementation of compensation, \nresettlement and rehabilitation measures. The Project Implementation Units (PIUs) will have \nthe primary responsibility of the preparation of RPs and their implementation. ERA/PMN \nwould ensure that RPs are prepared and approved prior to award of contracts for each \nsubproject, and for monitoring any changes to subproject design which may require re-\nevaluation of the need for and adequacy of the RP. PIUs will hire experienced NGOs/agency \nfor assisting in preparation as well as implementation of RP. The ERA will also appoint a \nResettlement Officer (RO) to supervise and do internal monitoring of the implementation \nwork. The Resettlement Officer, PIU and the NGO/agency staff will undergo an orientation \nand  training  in  resettlement  management.  The  training  activities  will  focus  on  issues \nconcerning (i) principles and procedures of land acquisition; (ii) public consultation and \nparticipation; (iii) entitlements and compensation disbursement mechanisms; (iv) Grievance \nRedressal  and  (v)  monitoring  of  resettlement  operation.  Independent  monitoring \nagency/expert will be hired by ERA in agreement with ADB to undertake external monitoring \nfor the entire project. \n15. The ERA will further ensure resettlement budgets are delivered on time to the competent \nauthority and the implementing NGOs for timely RP implementation.    \n \nF.  Disclosure, Consultation and Grievances \n \n16.  Each  RP  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  the \nstakeholders and will involve focus group discussion (FGD) and meetings, particularly with \nthe affected households. This Framework will be made available in local language(s) during \nthe public meetings at the community level. Copies of draft RPs will be made available at the \nlocal level public offices such as tehsil (revenue) and district offices, Block Development \nOffice (BDO), and gram panchayats to stakeholders for local inputs prior to award of civil \n                                                                                                                                                        \nInvoluntary Resettlement Category A: Significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, which are defined \nas (i) being physically displaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating). \nCategories A projects require a full resettlement plan. Some of these projects may require a resettlement framework prior to the \nfull resettlement plan. Involuntary Resettlement Category B: Not Significant include involuntary resettlement impacts that are \nnot deemed significant and require a short resettlement plan. Some of these projects may require a resettlement framework \nprior to the short resettlement plan. \n \n   ", "                                                                                                    Appendix 10   57 \nwork  contract.  The  summary  of  the  RP  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB  website  and  the \nconsultation will continue throughout the project implementation period.  \n \n17.  Complaints and grievance procedures will be outlined in each RP. The grievances \nwill be redressed at the local level in a consultative manner and with full participation of the \naffected  households,  or  their  representatives,  project  officials  and  local  government \nrepresentatives by the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC). The GRC shall comprise \nmembers from District Land and revenue Department, representatives of affected people, \nincluding women and vulnerable groups.  Grievances will be redressed within two to four \nweeks from the date of lodging the complaints. All costs incurred in resolving the complaints \nwill be borne by the project. \n \nG.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n18.  The NGO will submit monthly progress report of RP implementation to ERA through \nthe respective PIU. The ERA supported by the PIUs will conduct regular internal monitoring \nof resettlement implementation and prepare quarterly progress reports for submission to \nADB. The reports will contain progress made in RP implementation with particular attention \nto compliance with the principles and matrix set out in the resettlement plan. The report will \nalso document consultation activities conducted, provide summary of issues or problems \nidentified and actions taken to resolve the issues, and provide summary of grievances or \ncomplaints  lodged  by  households  and  actions  taken  to  redress  such  complaints.  The \nindependent agency/monitoring expert will submit its reports biannually directly to ADB.  The \nmonitoring will be carried out biannually during project implementation. \n   ", "              5\n8\n \nTable 2: Entitlement Matrix Table  A\np\n  p\ne\nIdentification of Affected  n\nType of Loss  Entitlement  Details  d\nHouseholds  ix\nA: LOSS OF LAND    1\n0\n       a).
