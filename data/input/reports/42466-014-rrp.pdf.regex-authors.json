I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Skills for \nEmployment Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The investment program will support the Government of Bangladesh\u2019s reforms in skills \ndevelopment, anchored in the National Skills Development Policy (NSDP), 2011. It will support \nlarge-scale private sector involvement and promote public\u2013private partnership, which is critical \nto meet existing and future labor market needs and to reduce the skills gap. This in turn is \ncrucial for Bangladesh to move away from the \u201clow-skill, low-wage equilibrium\u201d to a \u201chigher skill, \nhigher wage virtuous cycle\u201d to become a middle-income country. The investment program will \nhelp the government to scale-up skilling of new entrants and up-skilling of existing workers to \ncontribute to higher growth of priority sectors. It will also strengthen skills development in \nBangladesh and support transition to a sector-wide approach (SWAp) by establishing a unified \nfunding system and enhancing overall coordination of the currently fragmented system.2    \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Macroeconomic and Sector Context   \n \n3.  The Bangladesh economy has grown more rapidly at about 6% annually since 2003, up \nfrom 5% in the 1990s. The poverty headcount index declined sharply from 57% in 1992 to 31% \nin 2010. Social indicators have improved significantly, particularly for women. However, despite \nimpressive progress, the 2010 labor force survey indicated that more than 60% of the labor \nforce has either no education (40%) or up to primary education (22.8%); about 2 million young \npeople enter the labor force every year. The average wage per worker has remained low at \nTk200 per day for day laborers and Tk3,500 per month for garment workers.  \n \n4.  With the approval of the National Education Policy and the NSDP, the government \nembarked on major education and training reforms. The National Education Policy emphasizes \nthe overall importance of education and training, while the NSDP reinforces the importance of \nskills development and opens up the sector for major policy and institutional reforms including \nsubstantial involvement of the private sector. Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in primary \nand secondary education participation since 2000. Women\u2019s labor force participation grew from \n26% in 2003 to 36% in 2010. A major opportunity for the country comes from its declining \ndependency ratio, from a high of 108% in 1974 to 66% in 2010, leading to an increasing share \nof the working age population in the next three decades.3 However, this opportunity cannot be \ncapitalized on unless urgent investments are made in much higher quality schooling combined \nwith at least a four-fold increase in skilling and/or up-skilling of the labor force, which is expected \nto increase from 56.7 million in 2010 to 78 million in 2025.  \n \n5.  In its Perspective Plan 2021, Bangladesh articulates its vision to achieve middle-income \nstatus by 2021, including reducing the poverty rate by half.4 To accelerate economic growth \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2011.

Dhaka. \n \n ", "2   \nfrom the current 6% to 8% and above, the government must address the skills shortage\u2014one of \nthe key binding constraints. Skills development requires a two-pronged approach. First, it must \nbe anchored in foundational skills that come from high-quality schooling combined with relevant \nvocational and technical skills to capitalize on the demographic dividend. Second, it requires \nscaling  up  skills  training  by  four  to  eight  times  the  current  annual  training  capacity  to  \n(i) increase labor force productivity to contribute to higher average household income leading to \nhigher gross domestic product, (ii) double exports within 10 years, (iii) double remittances \nthrough  higher  skills  leading  to  higher  per  capita  remittances,  and  (iv)  promote  economic \ndiversification  including  trade  facilitation  and  industrialization.  The  government  will  provide \nsubsidies to the industry associations to catalyze the private sector to substantially scale up \nskills training under the investment program.   \n \n6.  Performance  of  skills  development.  The  low  productivity  of  the  labor  force  is  a \nfunction of low educational attainment, negligible vocational training (only 4% of the labor force \nhas vocational training), and limited capacity to provide high-quality training to meet current and \nfuture labor market needs. Skills development faces two major challenges: (i) the significant gap \nbetween demand and supply of labor, as growing industry demand is far outpacing supply; and \n(ii) weak technical and vocational education in terms of capacity and quality (poor teaching, \nlarge number of teacher vacancies, outdated buildings and equipment, curriculum unrelated to \nthe work place, and lack of engagement with the private sector). The result is a limited supply of \nlow-skilled graduates unable to meet domestic and foreign labor market needs.  \n \n7.  The skills development system remains highly fragmented with more than 20 ministries \nand divisions involved in some form of skills training, not well linked with industry and economic \ndevelopment policies. The system currently has the capacity to meet only 20% of the annual \ntraining needs (500,000 trainees are currently trained annually), job placement is less than 40% \nin most training institutions. The skills development system (i) lacks a common institutional and \nfinancing framework to coordinate skills development; (ii) has limited funding to scale-up skills \ntraining to meet the skills required by industry; (iii) has limited involvement of employers and \nenterprises to provide market responsive training with high labor market outcomes; and (iv) has \nlimited capacity to monitor system quality, improve recognition of skills acquired, implement \nhigh-quality assessment and certification systems, and expand capacity for preparing trainers \nand qualifications that meet international industry or trade standards.  \n \n2.  Policy and Strategic Frameworks  \n \n8.  Policy framework. The NSDP provides a solid framework to prepare Bangladesh to \nmove to a \u201chigher skill equilibrium.\u201d Its policy matrix drawn and emerging government\u2019s priorities \nemphasize (i) establishing and operationalizing a national human resource development fund \n(NHRDF) by 2015 to substantially scale up high-quality skills training to meet labor market \nneeds; (ii) setting up a new ministry or an authority for skills by 2017 to strengthen coordination \nby building on the initiatives of the National Skills Development Council (NSDC) chaired by the \nPrime  Minister;  (iii)  enhancing  the  quality  of  skills  development  in  partnership  with  the \nBangladesh Technical Education Board and industry skills councils (ISCs); (iv) catalyzing the \nprivate sector to develop and implement high-quality, market-responsive training programs;  \n(v)  revitalizing  public  training  providers  to  better  respond  to  labor  market  needs  through \ndelegation of powers and structured partnerships with the private sector; and (vi) enhancing \ncommon monitoring and moving to a SWAp to bring together the key stakeholders to support \nskills development.5  \n                                                \n5  Policy Matrix (accessible from the facility administration manual in Appendix 2). \n ", "    3 \n \n \n9.  Skills development road map. The government recognizes that the low education and \nskills of the labor force are a major binding constraint to achieving higher economic growth. To \naddress this, it needs to invest heavily in human development, particularly in schooling and \nskills development. Currently, only 500,000 receive skills training annually against the actual \nindustry need of at least 2 million. Similarly, the total expenditure in skills development is \nestimated at around $150 million per year against the need to invest about $600 million; these \nnumbers will grow as the labor force increases by 40% by 2025. Industry leaders want to \nparticipate actively in skilling the work force in priority sectors to exploit the full potential of \ngrowth opportunities.     \n \n10.  Strategic context. The investment program is aligned with the Bangladesh country \npartnership strategy, which identifies the low competitiveness of firms as a key constraint to \ngrowth particularly the low skills and low productivity of the workforce.6 It is also aligned with the \nPerspective Plan, 2010\u20132021 and the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which emphasize the \nneed  to  develop  \u201ca  workforce  equipped  with  contemporary  technical  skills  and  knowledge \nthrough advanced vocational training,\u201d with a \u201cmechanism to encourage collaboration between \ntraining institutes and industry to optimize the utilization of available human resources.\u201d  \n \n11.  Lessons.  The  investment  program  builds  upon  previous  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) assistance in Bangladesh and elsewhere, and incorporates lessons from these.7 \n \n3.  Key Features   \n \n12.  Long-term  programmatic  approach.  The  road  map  and  the  comparison  matrix \nstrongly justify the need to adopt an MFF to allow the government to (i) establish a credible and \nsustainable institutional arrangement to develop and coordinate the skills sector; (ii) target \npriority growth sectors and skill levels8 to enhance employability of the working age population \ninformed by a skills-gap analysis, increase average income of the workforce by increasing labor \nproductivity, and improve job placement rates; (iii) gradually shift the large proportion of the \nworkforce  currently  in  the  informal  sector  to  the  formal  sector;  and  (iv)  improve  overall \nmonitoring and performance of the skills development sector in a concerted manner. \n \n13.  Focus on outputs, outcome, and strong monitoring. The investment program will \nhelp expand the capacity of the public and private sector to provide market-responsive skills \ntraining with an enhanced job placement and/or self-employment rate from less than 40% \ncurrently to 70%. Disbursement for training will be based on progress payments against agreed \nunit costs per course: (i) enrollment, (ii) completion of training, and (iii) job placement of trainees \nwithin 6 months after completing training. The evidence will be the certified list of trainees \nagainst  each  milestone  maintained  by  all  training  providers  through  a  web-based  trainee \ntracking system. The progress payment will be clearly stipulated in the project agreement or \ncontracts between the executing agency and the 32 public training providers, Bangladesh Bank \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Department, industry associations, and Palli-Karma Sahayak \nFoundation (PKSF) under tranche 1.9  \n \n14.  Transition to a sector-wide approach. The NSDP envisages bringing the currently \nfragmented skills development sector under one coordinated framework, one unified funding \nwindow, and commensurate institutional arrangements. The program will help the government \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015. Manila.  \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Skills Development (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  The six priority sectors for tranche 1 are readymade garments, leather, construction, light engineering, information \ntechnology, and ship building and maritime. The skill levels are low, semi-skilled, and skilled. \n ", "4   \nadopt a SWAp to leverage greater funding from the private sector and development partners to \nimplement the NSDP effectively. The SWAp road map proposes developing and implementing a \nskills development program framework in collaboration with development partners and other \nstakeholders by developing a costed skills sector development program under a medium-term \nbudgetary framework.    \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The impact will be increased income and productivity of the working population aged 15 \nyears and over. The outcome will be increased employment in priority sectors and skills for \nmales and females.  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n16.  The investment program will be implemented in the first 7 years of the government\u2019s 10-\nyear investment program. Project 1, to be implemented during FY2014\u2013FY2018, will help lay \nthe  foundation  for  scaling  up  high-quality  training  programs,  enhancing  quality  assurance \nsystem that is recognized internationally, strengthening funding and overall coordination, and \nenhancing the monitoring and evaluation and governance of skills development. The investment \nprogram will have four outputs, with the following activities under project 1.  \n \n17.  Output 1: Market responsive inclusive skills training delivered. The program will (a) \nengage 32 public training providers under three ministries to train about 47,400 people; and \nnine  associations  (192,600),  PKSF  (10,000),  and  Bangladesh  Bank  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise Department (10,000) to train more than 200,000 people in six priority sectors, with an \naverage job placement of 70%; and (b) help target 40,000 people from disadvantaged groups \nincluding people with disabilities and 40% women, and support pilot targeting mechanisms.  \n \n18.  Output 2: Quality assurance system strengthened. First, the investment program will \nsupport development of at least five qualification packages including occupational standards, \none  for  each  priority  sector;  and  support  registration  of  all  participating  training  providers. \nSecond, it will train trainers, industry assessors, and principals and managers of the public and \nprivate  training  institutions.  Third,  it  will  support  improvements  of  training  facilities  of \nparticipating public training providers; promote partnerships by bringing together public and \nprivate training providers to maximize enrollments and share facilities and resources to address \nthe  skills  needs  of  industry;  and  develop  criteria  and  mechanisms  to  establish  centers  of \nexcellence in each priority sector. Fourth, it will strengthen the capacity for assessment and \ncertification through partnerships of Bangladesh Technical Education Board and ISCs in each \npriority sector, and help establish a system to recognize skills already obtained by trainees from \ndifferent sources.  \n \n19.  Output 3: Institutions strengthened. First, the investment program will help establish \nthe national human resource development fund under the Ministry of Finance as envisaged in \nthe  NSDP  to  increase  funding  to  substantially  increase  the  capacity  for  high-quality  skills \n                                                                                                                                                       \n9 In tranche 1, there are 32 public training providers under the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Expatriates\u2019 \nWelfare and Overseas Employment, and the Ministry of Industry. The nine associations under tranche 1 are \nBangladesh  Garment  Manufacturers  and  Exporters  Association,  Bangladesh  Knitwear  Manufacturers  and \nExporters Association, Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, Leathergoods and Footwear Manufacturers and \nExporters Association of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Association of Construction Industry, Bangladesh Engineering \nIndustry Owners\u2019 Association, Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services, Bangladesh Call \nCenter Operators' Association, and Shipbuilders Association. Palli-Karma Sahayak Foundation and Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Department are also included. \n ", "    5 \n \ntraining. Second, it will support the establishment of a new ministry or an authority for skills with \nits  own  medium-term  budgetary  framework  for  skills  development  by  building  on  NSDC\u2019s \ninitiatives. Third, it will provide delegation of powers to the participating around 100 public \ntraining institutions to mobilize resources, hire trainers and resource persons, offer flexible \ncourses, and enter into partnership with employers and enterprises. Fourth, it will strengthen \nindustry linkages, job placement, and career counseling in partnership with training providers \nand employers. \n \n20.  Output 4: Effective program management. First, the investment program will support \na robust monitoring and evaluation system to track students and train providers to ensure high-\nquality  training  and  job  placement;  and  support  the  NSDC  secretariat  in  common  sector \nmonitoring, skills gap analysis, and strengthening of ISCs. Second, it will strengthen sector \nplanning and budgeting for the skills development sector to move toward a SWAp by 2017. \nThird, it will establish mechanisms to strengthen governance and risk management in skills \ndevelopment in close partnership with the NSDC secretariat. Fourth, it will support effective \nproject management. \n \n21.  Project 2 (tranche 2) will be implemented during FY2017\u2013FY2020 and will overlap with \ntranche 1. It will expand coverage to 10 priority sectors by supporting the full operationalization \nand strengthening of an additional five ISCs. This phase will expand activities initiated in tranche \n1 and help refine models for targeting (vouchers and stipends), assessment and certification, \neffective  use  of  information  and  communication  technology,  sustainable  financing  (greater \ncontributions from government, development partners, private sector, and users), and effective \nprogram management (refinements in output-based financing to link more closely  with job \nplacement and job retention with higher incomes, more effective monitoring). A major emphasis \nwill be to support the government to fully implement the SWAp modality. \n \n22.  Project 3 (tranche 3) will be implemented during FY2018\u2013FY2021 and will overlap with \ntranche 2. It will expand coverage to 15 priority sectors by supporting an additional five ISCs. \nMore development partners are expected to join the SWAp and the private sector is anticipated \nto make larger investments in skills development. This is expected to lead to a vibrant market \nfor skills development, which will in turn spur innovations. The public training institutions will be \nable to forge partnerships with the private sector. The new ministry or authority for skills is \nexpected to be operating fully during this phase and will help consolidate the skills development \nsector. The quality assurance system is expected to develop further, ISCs are expected to be \nfully operating, and several centers of excellence are expected to function effectively.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n  \n23.  The investment program is estimated to cost $1.07 billion, including taxes and duties \n(Table 1).10 The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $500 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the investment program. As an initial support, ADB will \nprovide $350 million comprising three tranches, not exceeding 7 years from the approval date, \nsubject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  loan \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF, for $100 million, will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% per annum throughout \n                                                \n10  Development partners are anticipated to contribute $400 million and the private sector $86.5 million for tranche 2 \nand tranche 3 once the National Human Resource Development Fund is established by 2015 and the SWAp by \n2017. The current program aims to add 1.25 million new entrants to the skilled workforce based on current \ncommitted funding. If development partner financing materializes, outputs would be enhanced. \n ", "6   \nthe loan term, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. It \nadditionally  includes  cofinancing  of  $10  million  equivalent  from  the  Government  of \nSwitzerland,11 which will be administered by ADB, to finance a skills development coordination \nand monitoring unit (SDCMU) and consultancy services costs. Subject to performance, the \nGovernment of Switzerland is expected to finance $10 million for each of the subsequent two \ntranches under the MFF, which will be administered by ADB. The MFF financing plan is in Table \n2. The ADB loan is 32.7% of the total cost and will be used to finance expenditures for skills \ntraining,  human  resources,  equipment,  furniture,  minor  civil  works,  instructional  materials, \ncapacity building, and related technical assistance.  \n \nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million)a \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The Finance Division under the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency, and \nthe SDCMU headed by an additional secretary with the rank of executive project director will \nhelp the Finance Division coordinate program implementation. The implementing agencies are \nthe Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Expatriates\u2019 Welfare and Overseas Employment, the \nMinistry  of  Industry,  the  Bangladesh  Technical  Education  Board,  the  National  Skills \nDevelopment  Council  Secretariat,  and  Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDepartment. Nine industry associations12 and PKSF  will be contracted  using single-source \nselection method. An interministerial program steering committee led by the secretary of the \n                                                \n11  Through the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n12  Once the ISCs are incorporated and functioning, they will replace the associations as tranche 2 partner agencies.  \n ", "    7 \n \nFinance  Division  will  oversee  implementation,  approve  annual  operation  plans,  review \nachievements  against  annual  targets,  and  ensure  compliance  with  fiduciary  oversight \narrangements. An implementation committee led by the executive project director will coordinate \nimplementation  by  all  partner  agencies,  review  implementation  progress,  and  recommend \napproval of annual work plans and budgets. The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 3 and described in detail in the facility administration manual.13  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements\n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2014\u2013June 2021 \nEstimated completion date  Physical completion of the investment program will be 30 June 2021. \nPhysical completion of project 1 will be 31 December 2017. \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Program steering committee chaired by the Finance Division secretary \n(ii)   Executing agency  Finance Division under the Ministry of Finance \n(iii)  Key implementing  SDCMU along with 3 ministries and Bangladesh Bank SME Department  \nagency \n(iv)  Implementation unit  SDCMU  \nProcurement   National competitive bidding  13 contracts    $8.20 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  5 packages   $11.19 million \nQuality-based selection  6 packages  $5.20 million \nConsultant qualification selection  4 packages  $1.20 million \nIndividual  Several (TBD)  $7.70 million \nSingle-source selection  12 packages  $53.08 million \nRetroactive financing and  The loan, under each tranche, may finance eligible expenditures of up to 20% of \nadvance contracting  the loan amount.

Procurement. The government will procure all goods, works, and consulting services \nfor the investment program. Goods and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Goods valued at more than  \n$1  million  and  works  valued  at  more  than  $2  million  will  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive bidding and ADB's standard bidding documents, and be subject to prior review. \nGoods and works valued below the international competitive bidding threshold will be procured \nusing national competitive bidding in accordance with the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act \n(2006)  and  it\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Rules  (2008),  subject  to  modifications  agreed  by  the \ngovernment and ADB. All consultants will be selected using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Since the investment program is being \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and ADB will also be administering cofinancing to \nbe provided by the Government of Switzerland, ADB\u2019s member country eligibility restrictions will \nnot  apply  to  this  investment  program.  Up  to  nine  industry  associations  and  PKSF  will  be \ncontracted by the executive agency using single-source selection to deliver skills training in \nagreed sectors and skills areas.  \n \n \n                                                \n13 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.   Economic viability. The economic viability of project 1 was assessed based on the \nbenefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  investment  program.  Economic  benefits  include  \n(i) direct benefits for students with increased employability and higher wages, (ii) direct benefits \nfor employers in terms of improved productivity and returns on investment, and (iii) improved \ninternal efficiency for reducing system wastage caused by low completion rate. The three major \nstreams  of  economic  costs  are  (i)  direct  project  costs  associated  with  the  four  outputs,  \n(ii) private costs of trainees for participation and indirect opportunity cost of their foregone \nearnings during training, and (iii) costs shared by training institutions. Project 1 is estimated to \nyield a net present value of $142 million under the base case scenario. The economic internal \nrates of return were calculated for three scenarios assuming a discount rate of 12%: (i) base \ncase: 22.89%, (ii) optimistic case: 31.15%, and (iii) pessimistic case: 15.93%. This suggests that \nthe investment program will be a sound investment. \n \n27.  Fiscal sustainability. Fiscal sustainability will depend on (i) availability of resources, \nespecially success of the government\u2019s revenue mobilization efforts; (ii) priority assigned to \nskills development; and (iii) at least partial recovery of costs from trainees and employers. Since \nskills development is emerging as a major sector, the government will mobilize resources from \nat least four sources: (i) its own resources to leverage other sources of funds, (ii) funds from \ndevelopment partners, (iii) private sector contributions initially through cost sharing and drawing \non corporate social responsibility, and (iv) promotion of cost recovery where feasible from \ntranche 2. The long-term sustainability of the program will depend on (i) increasing the quality of \nskills training to meet high labor market outcomes, (ii) increasing labor force productivity leading \nto higher returns on business investment, and (iii) gradual increasing wages to induce more \ninvestments from individuals in skills training.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  The financial  management  assessment  shows  that  the government\u2019s framework for \npublic financial management is under transition and a number of improvements have been \nmade  in  recent  years.  Although  the  overall  system  remains  weak  and  associated  with \nsubstantial  fiduciary  risks,  the  executing  agency  is  associated  with  lower  risks.  Specific \nweaknesses of government and nongovernment entities relevant to program implementation \ninclude budget preparation; accounting; internal control; and timing and quality of financial \nreporting, internal audit, and external audit.14 The financial management assessment of the \ngovernment  entities  specifically  noted  shortcomings  regarding  the  staffing  of  the  accounts \ndepartments.  The  assessment  found  that  overall  fiduciary  risks  of  sector  associations  are \nsubstantial, and that shortcomings relevant for the program relate especially to planning and \nbudgeting, internal control, grant management, resolution of external audit observations, and \nstaffing. For the investment program, key risks include the inability of training providers to \nmanage their working capital requirements as well as accumulated uncleared advances. The \nassociated fiduciary risks can be treated in the short term by the use of safeguards and in the \nlonger term through effective financial management (and anticorruption) reform programs. The \ntime  for  reforms  to  reduce  risk  is  likely  to  be  medium  to  long  term  (5\u201310  years),  which \ncorresponds with the planned overall program time frame. Risk mitigation measures include \n                                                \n14  Audits undertaken by the Foreign Aided Projects Audit Directorate generally are deemed satisfactory regarding \nboth quality and timing. \n ", "    9 \n \nprogress  payments  linked  to  unit  cost  analysis,  instituting  a  tracking  system  to  track  the \nprogress of all trainees, validating unit costs, managing advances to nongovernment entities, \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  financial  management  action  plans  for  the  involved \ngovernment and nongovernment entities, undertaking rigorous annual fiduciary reviews, and \nsupporting relevant external audit mechanisms. Key elements of the financial management \naction  plan  include  tracking  of  advances  using  the  advances  tracking  module  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s  integrated  budgeting  and  accounting  system,  requiring  close  monitoring  of \nadvances and working capital of each of the training providers by the SDCMU, and capacity \nbuilding initiatives in financial reporting and budgeting. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Shortage of productive and remunerative employment is a major cause of poverty and \nvulnerability. While the total labor force increased from 46.3 million in FY2003 to 53.5 million in \nFY2010,  the  overall  labor  force  participation  rate  of  59.3%  remains  low  by  international \nstandard. However, the growth in labor force participation of 2.81% during FY1974\u2013FY2011 has \noutpaced  the  population  growth  rate  of  1.86%.  This  increase  is  largely  coming  from  the \naccelerated  rate  of  female  participation  in  recent  years,  although  the  female  labor  force \nparticipation rate of 36% is less than half that for males (82%). Furthermore, the participation of \nwomen in the labor force is largely concentrated in the informal and low wage sectors. There is \nstill a significant gap in women\u2019s share in the skilled labor force, especially in technical and \nvocational employment. A bigger challenge has been that employment growth has been slower \nthan total labor force growth, and underemployment is the most serious challenge afflicting over \n25%  of  the  workforce.  The  investment  program  will  support  NSDP  implementation,  which \nprioritizes targeting the poor and vulnerable groups including women as part of supporting high-\ngrowth priority sectors with the potential for creating more and better jobs. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Under project 1, only existing facilities will receive support for minor adjustment or \nrenovations to cater to training activity needs. No acquisition of land or relocation of people is \nplanned. Accordingly, project 1 is category C for environment and involuntary resettlement \nsafeguards. The investment program will reach and include unskilled residents of remote areas \nand members of disadvantaged groups, including indigenous peoples. Project 1 is expected to \nhave  positive  impacts  and  is  classified  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples  safeguards  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).15  A  small  ethnic  community \nplanning  framework  was  developed  to  guide  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in \nassessing the presence of indigenous peoples in the project area and conducting separate \nconsultations to elicit their views, identify the need for culturally compatible mechanisms for their \nparticipation, and ensure incorporation of adequate measures in project activities. The executing \nagency through the SDCMU will monitor these activities closely and ensure necessary actions. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16  \n \n \n                                                \n15 Environmental Assessment Review Framework; Resettlement Framework; and Small Ethnic Community Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

ASSURANCES  \n \n32.  The government and the Ministry of Finance have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \nThe government and the Finance Division have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, \nwhich are set forth in the framework financing agreement.
