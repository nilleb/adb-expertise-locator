The \nProject  will  (i)  improve  the  learning  environment  by  upgrading  the \nphysical  infrastructure  in  schools;  and  (ii)  enhancing  teacher \ncapabilities  through  training  of  trainers  and  teachers,  improved \ncurriculum, and instruction materials. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  four  components:  (i)  increasing  equitable \naccess \nfor \neducationally disadvantaged groups, ethnic minorities, and girls; (ii) \nan  improved  and  relevant  curriculum,  improved  assessment  and \naccessible instructional materials; (iii) an improved and sustainable \nsystem  for  the  education,  development  and  management  of \nteachers; and (iv) improved institutional capacity and management \nfor more efficient and effective delivery of education.  \n \nLimited  access  and  low  quality  of  education  are  key  impediments \nto  economic  and  social  development  of  the  country.  Inequitable \naccess  also  contributes  to  social  tensions.  The  Government \nrecognizes  education  as  a  key  intervention  for  poverty  reduction. \nImproved  access  to  and  quality  of  secondary  education  will  help \nconsolidate the gains from expansion of basic education, produce \na  skilled  work  force  better  able  to  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s \neconomic  development  and  play  a  useful  and  progressive  role  in \nsociety.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s objective is to improve the quality of public secondary \neducation  and  improve  access  to  education  for  the  underserved \ngroups, particularly girls and children from disadvantaged groups.  \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $74.8  million  equivalent  of  which \n$9.29 million (12%) is the foreign exchange cost and $65.5 million \nequivalent (88%) the local currency cost.  \n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\niii \n\n65.54 \n88% \n\n74.83 \n100% \n\n9.29 \n      12% \n\nForeign \nExchange \n3.24 \n6.05 \n1.97 \n4.08 \n0.00 \n\n \nSource \nADB \nDanida \n    Joint Financing with ADB \n    Parallel Financing \nGovernment \n\n($ million) \n \nPercent \n40 \n40 \n \n \n20 \n \n100 \n \nTotal \n \n       Percentage Share \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Danida = Danish International Development \nAssistance. \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n26.76 \n23.95 \n21.73 \n2.22 \n14.83 \n\nTotal \nCost \n30.00 \n30.00 \n23.70 \n6.30 \n14.83 \n\n \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $30  million  equivalent \nfrom  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  term  of  the  loan  will  be  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  ADB  will  finance  40%  of  the  project  costs.  This  covers \n$3.2  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $26.8  million \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Danish  International \nDevelopment  Assistance  (Danida)  will  provide  a  grant  of  $30.0 \nmillion (40%) to cofinance the Project with ADB ($23.70 million on \na  joint  basis  to  be  administered  by  ADB  and  $6.30  million  on  a \nparallel  basis).  The  Government  will  provide  $14.8  million \nequivalent (20%).  \n \n30 September 2008 \n \n31 March 2008 \n\n \nTo  build  ownership,  a  separate  project  implementation  unit  (PIU) \nwill  not  be  set  up.  The  director  general  of  the  Department  of \nEducation  will  serve  as  the  project  director.  Under  the  overall \nsupervision  of  the  Department  of  Education,  the  concerned \neducation  agencies  such  as  the  National  Center  for  Educational \nDevelopment,  Secondary  Education  Development  Center, \nCurriculum  Development  Center,  and  Office  of  the  Controller  of \nExamination will be responsible for implementing the activities that \nfall  under  their  respective  jurisdiction  by  integrating  the  activities \ninto  their  regular  work  program.  This  is  expected  to  lead  to \nstrengthening of institutional capacity as well as greater ownership. \n \nDepartment of Education  \n \nAll  procurement  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  reflecting \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  policy  and  mandatory  use  of  the  ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents.  \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\ntotal  of  189  person-months  of \n\nA  total  input  of  237  person-months  of  international  consulting  and \n759  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  is  planned.  Of  this,  48 \nperson-months  of \ninternational  consultant  services  and  346 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultant  services  will  be  funded \njointly  by  ADB  and  Danida,  and  will  be  recruited  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  A \ninternational \nconsulting services and 413 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices  will  be  funded  by  Danida  on  a  parallel  basis  and  will  be \nrecruited according to Danida\u2019s guidelines. \n \nThese consulting services will support substantial strengthening of \ncapacity and skills at the institutional as well as administrative and \nmanagement levels. \n \nThe  main  project  benefit  will  be  improved  access  and  quality  of \nsecondary education through (i) an improved learning environment \nin schools, (ii) upgradation of teacher skills and competencies, (iii) \nimproved  curriculum  and  assessment,  and  (iv)  strengthened \nfor  delivery  of  education.  The  direct \ninstitutional  capacity \nbeneficiaries of the Project will be (i) students currently enrolled in \nsecondary  schools  and \nteachers, \nmanagers,  and  administrators  who  will  receive  training  and  thus \nupgrade  their  skills;  and  (iii)  staff  of  institutions  responsible  for \ndelivery  of  education  who  will  benefit  from  improved  skills.  The \nultimate  benefit  will  accrue  to  society  through  better-educated \nyouth  who  will  contribute  to  economic  and  social  development  of \nthe country.  \n \nBenefits to society at large will accrue through human development \nand  productivity  efficiency  through  increased  numbers  of  higher \nquality  secondary  students,  and  a  better-qualified  and  more \nproductive  workforce  leading  to  improved  earnings.  Significant \nsocial  benefits  will  be  derived  from  girls\u2019  education  such  as  lower \nfertility,  improved  health  and  nutrition  status  of  their  families,  and \nto \nhigher  education  attainment  of \nintergenerational benefits.  \n \n\ntheir  successors;  (ii) \n\ntheir  children \n\nleading \n\nthe \n\n\fv \n\nRisks and Assumptions  Two  major  risk  factors  could  have  an  impact  on  the  Project.  The \nfirst stems from the prevailing security situation in the country and \nits  possible  impact  on  project  activities.  Since  the  Project  aims  to \ntarget  poorer,  disadvantaged  districts  that    are  more  affected  by \ninsurgency, by the time implementation begins the targeting criteria \nmay  need  to  be  revised.  However,  a  key  grievance  of  the \ninsurgents  is  the  poor  quality  of  education  in  public  schools. \nInterventions  that  aim  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  education \nmay not be affected by the disturbances. The situation will need to \nbe  assessed  more  critically  before  project  implementation  so  that \nsuitable adaptations may be effected in project design.  \n \nThe second risk is to financial sustainability . Although the loan and \ngrant \nfunds  do  not  support  recurrent  costs  during  project \nimplementation, the Government will have to provide an additional \n$0.5  million  annually  for  secondary  education  to  sustain  project \ninputs  after  the  project  closes.  Although,  even  in  the  currently \nprevailing  difficult  fiscal  situation,  the  Government  has  maintained \nits  allocation \nfor  security \nif \nexpenditures continue to grow and the economy continues to suffer \ndue  to  the  disturbances,  necessary  resources  for  education  may \nbe  constrained.  However,  such  constraints  are  not  likely  to  have \nsignificant \ninputs  such  as  strengthened \ninstitutional  and  management  capacity,  and  improvements  in \ncurriculum,  assessment,  and  teacher  capabilities  which  will  have \nsubstantial impact on improving the quality of education  \n \nOther  risks  such  as  weak  management  and  institutional  capacity \nwill  be  mitigated  by  project  inputs  especially  designed  to  address \nthese weaknesses.  \n \n\nimpact  on  project \n\nfor  education, \n\nthe  demands \n\n \n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Secondary Education Support Project (SESP).1 \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nthe  most  disadvantaged.  Participation  rates \n\nConsiderable progress in secondary education has been made in the past two decades. \n2. \nEnrollments  in  secondary  education  increased  dramatically  by  324%  in  the  lower  secondary \ngrades (grades 6\u22128) and by 124% at the secondary level (grades 9\u221210). Despite this, improving \naccess to and the quality and efficiency of secondary education remains a formidable challenge. \nAlthough  the  gross  enrollment  ratio  (GER)2  is  57%  at  the  lower  secondary  level,  the  net \nenrollment  ratio  (NER)3  is  only  31%.  At  the  secondary  level,  the  GER  and  NER  are  39%  and \n21%  respectively.  Such  low  levels  of  participation  in  secondary  education  are  a  severe \nconstraint to Nepal\u2019s economic development.  \n \n3. \nWithin this limited access, there are further disparities by geographic location, as well as \neconomic  and  social  background.  Girls  are  disproportionately  disadvantaged  in  all  categories. \nGirls constitute 43% of total primary enrollment, 41% of lower secondary enrollment, and 40% of \nsecondary  enrollment.  Significant  gaps  exist  between  the  poor  and  the  nonpoor.  According  to \nthe Nepal Living Standards Survey (1996), children from the highest income quartile are twice \nas  likely  to  be  enrolled  in  primary  schools  and  10  times  as  likely  to  be  enrolled  in  secondary \nschools than children from the lowest income quartile. Participation rates also vary considerably \nacross the geographic regions with people living in the mountainous belt and the Far Western \nRegion  being \nto \ndisadvantaged groups also decline as students move to higher levels of education. This is also \ntrue of students with physical disabilities. Lack of education limits employment opportunities for \nthe  poor,  constrains  productivity,  and  perpetuates  poverty.  Lack  of  access  to  education  is  a \nmajor cause of poverty among Nepal\u2019s disadvantaged groups and contributes to social tensions \nin the country.  \n \n4. \nThe  overall  quality  and  efficiency  of  secondary  education  is  low.  Schools  have  poor \nphysical  infrastructure  and  inadequate  learning  materials,  laboratories,  and  libraries.  Teachers \nare  poorly  qualified,  partially  trained  or  not  trained  at  all,  and  unmotivated.  Limited  resources \nhamper  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  effect  any  improvements.  Teacher  salaries  account  for \napproximately  95%  of  the  Government\u2019s  expenditure  on  secondary  education.  Of  those  that \nenroll in school, less than 29% reach grade 10. In 2000, the average repetition rate was 13% at \nthe  lower  secondary  level  and  9%  at  grade  9.  In  2001,  the  pass  rate  for  the  school  leaving \ncertificate (SLC) examination at the end of grade 10 was only 32%. The poor quality of public \neducation  has  led  to  a  proliferation  of  private  schools  that  are  accessed  by  the  economically \nadvantaged sections of society creating another layer of disparity and disadvantage. The poor \nperformance  of  the  education  system  wastes  already  scarce  resources.  The  SESP  seeks  to \nimprove  the  efficiency  and  quality  of  education  to  make  it  a  more  effective  tool  of  national \ndevelopment (Appendix 1). \n \n\nfor  students  belonging \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2000.

Challenges  identified  in \nvarious official documents of the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) and agencies active \nin the education sector include (i) low levels of literacy and educational attainment; (ii) unequal \nparticipation  in  schooling  across  income  and  social  groups,  and  geographic  regions;  (iii)  high \nrepetition  and  dropout  rates;  and  (iv)  low  pass  rates  at  the  SLC  level.  A  summary  of  key \nproblems (Appendix 3) in education follows.  \n \n \n \n6. \nUnequal  Access.  There  are  distinct  disparities  in  physical  infrastructure,  teaching \nresources,  and  learning  materials  for  schools  across  and  within  regions.  The  remote  hill  and \nmountainous  areas  suffer  due  to  poor  accessibility;  but  within  regions,  the  rural  and  remote \nareas  suffer  similar  disadvantages.  These  areas  are  home  to  larger  proportions  of  poorer \nsections of the population. Typically these are also areas of educational disadvantage with low \nparticipation rates from among economically and socially disadvantaged children including girls. \nA further divide in access to quality education occurs through the provision of private education, \nthat not only caters to those who can afford to pay but is concentrated in the more accessible \nregions of the country.  \n \nLearning  Environment.  Poor  and  inadequate  physical  facilities  in  schools,  particularly \n7. \nin  rural  and  underdeveloped  areas  have  contributed  to  low  achievement  levels.  Most  schools, \nparticularly  in  rural  areas,  were  established  as  primary  schools.  In  response  to  local  demand, \nthey  evolved  into  lower  secondary  and  secondary  schools.  Due  to  resource  constraints,  the \ndevelopment of physical infrastructure did not match the expansion. Most school buildings are in \npoor  condition,  lack  sanitation  and  piped  water  facilities,  and  have  inadequate  laboratory  and \nlibrary space. Consequently, school infrastructure is a key concern for government.  \n \n \n \n8. \nCurriculum  and  Assessment.  Poor  linkages  between  revisions  in  curriculum  and \nclassroom teaching and assessment render the revisions ineffective and also severely constrain \nthe quality of education. Besides, curriculum, supporting learning materials and approaches to \nassessment need to be revised and updated to meet the needs of a modernizing economy. At \npresent, these are reviewed over 5-year and 10-year cycles.  Within these cycles, new curricula \nand  textbooks  have  been  developed  for  lower  secondary,  secondary,  and  higher  secondary \nlevels.  New  approaches  to  assessment  have  been  introduced.  However,  the  national \ndissemination  strategies  have  lacked  consistency.  Head  teachers,  teachers,  and  school \nsupervisors have been oriented in a cascade of workshops, in some cases supported by self-\nlearning  handbooks.  Apart  from  grades  9\u221210,  where  teachers  from  across  the  nation  were \ninvolved,  participation  by  subject  teachers  has  been  limited.  Little  linkage  exists  between  the \nteacher approaches required by the curriculum and textbooks, and what teachers have learned \nin  preservice  education  courses.  This  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  effectiveness  of \nrevisions in curriculum.  \n \n9. \nTeacher Quality. The low quality of teaching is another major reason for the poor quality \nof  education.  Low  entry-level  qualifications,  inadequate  or  no  training,  poor  motivation,  and \ninadequate  support  and  supervision  contribute  to  the  malaise  of  poor  teaching  quality.  Of  the \napproximately  24,700  teachers  at  the  lower  secondary  level,  about  9,700  are  completely \nuntrained  and  3,000  are  partially  trained.  At  the  secondary  level,  of  the  approximately  19,200 \nteachers, an estimated 4,850 are untrained and 1,350 are partially trained. Not surprisingly, the \npass  rate  for  the  SLC  administered  at  the  end  of  grade  10  was  a  dismal  32%  in  2001.  Since \n\nQuality \n\n2. \n\n\f3 \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building \n\nteacher salaries consume a large percentage of the budget for education, the issue of teacher \nquality needs to be addressed urgently.  \n \n10. \nAt the lower secondary level, only 12% teachers are female. At the secondary level, the \nfigure  is  even  more  dismal  at  7.6%.  Approximately  45%  of  these  are  concentrated  in  the \nKathmandu  valley.  A  sample  of  teachers  from  four  districts  classified  as  containing  a  high \nproportion of disadvantaged groups showed that only 8.3% of teachers were from these groups. \nThe  gross  underrepresentation  of  these  groups  is  a  reflection  of  the  inequities  all  through  the \neducation system.  \n \n \n \n11.  Management and Institutional Capacity. The administrative setup for the planning and \nmanagement of education has been inadequate and also subject to some experimentation over \nthe years. MOES has been overstretched in its administrative, planning, and policy formulation \nfunctions. This was partly addressed during the design of the second Basic Primary Education \nProgram (BPEPII) when the Department of Education (DOE) was created at the national level to \nadminister school education, leaving MOES with responsibility for policy and planning. However, \nDOE has been preoccupied with the administration and management of the expanded needs of \nprimary education. Lower secondary and secondary education have not received proportionate \nattention.  Institutions  and  agencies  providing  support  to  school  education  have  also  remained \nfragmented by subsector and their capacity for providing quality support has been hampered by \ninadequate  staff  development,  poor  facilities,  and  frequent  movement  of  staff.  These \nweaknesses have resulted in a lack of ownership, weak implementation of policies, inadequate \ncapacity for meeting the demands for management, and teacher training. This in turn has had a \nserious negative impact on the overall quality of education.  \n\n \n\n12. \nGovernment Policies. Poverty reduction is the Government\u2019s primary development goal \nas enunciated in the 10th Five-Year Plan, which is currently being formulated.  Improving access \nto and the quality and efficiency of education, with particular emphasis on literacy and women\u2019s \neducation, is a key component of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. The draft Policy \nObjectives  for  Education  in  the  10th  Plan  address  poverty  reduction  through  several  policy \nobjectives that acknowledge the multidimensional nature of poverty. These include (i) increasing \ncommunity  participation  and  mobilization  in  managing  and  resourcing  school  education,  (ii) \ndecentralizing education management and monitoring, (iii) introducing cost sharing in secondary \neducation  to  partially  address  issue  of  resource  scarcity,  (iv)  strengthening  institutional  and \nschool  management  including  regulation  of  private  schools,  (v)  providing  school-based \nmanagement for greater ownership, (vi) providing institutional capacity building, (vii) increasing \nthe use of information communication technology (ICT) in education, (viii) improving access to \neducation  for  girls  and  other  disadvantaged  children,  (ix)  increasing  partnerships  with  civil \nsociety and the private sector, and (x) improving monitoring and evaluation. \n \n13. \nAlthough  government  policies  are  becoming  more  coherent  and  educational  goals  are \nbeing  defined  under  a  broad  policy  umbrella,  policy  reform  is  hampered  by  the  complexity  of \nexisting  policy  structures;  limited  financial,  institutional,  and  professional  capacity  to  carry  out \nreform;  and  to  some  degree,  a  systemic,  institutional,  and  stakeholder  resistance  to  major \nchange. In the past, policy limitations have had a serious impact on the quality and efficiency of \neducation. While some limitations are recognized, key policy initiatives necessary for making the \neducation system more efficient have been discussed in detail, agreed upon, and are addressed \nby the Project. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s  Sector  Strategy.  In  its  draft  education  policy,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) articulates its vision for education, as  \u201call children and adults will have equitable access \nto education of sufficient quality to empower them to break the poverty cycle, to improve their \nquality  of  life,  and  to  participate  effectively  in  national  development.\u201d    ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction \n\n\f4 \n\nstrategy  also  calls  for  support  for  provision  of  basic  services,  including  education,  as  a  key \npoverty  reduction  measure.  The  Project  supports  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update \nfor  Nepal,  which  emphasizes  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  educational  reforms  and \ndecentralization policies. \n \nADB\u2019s  strategy4  for  the  education  sector  in  Nepal  has  evolved  to  emphasize \n15. \nstrengthening  investments  made  during  past  projects  and  to  build  upon  them  to  move  toward \nholistic planning and management for the education sector. Thus, the process begun under the \nADB-financed Primary Education Development Project for creating an infrastructure for teacher \ntraining  was  supported  under  the  Teacher  Education  Project5  and  will  be  strengthened  and \nconsolidated  under  the  proposed  SESP.  In  other  areas  such  as  curriculum  and  examination \nreform,  school  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  the  SESP  will  build  upon \ninvestments  made  under  the  Secondary  Education  Development  Project  (SEDP),  and  at  the \nsame  time,  move  these  areas  toward  greater  cohesion  and  complementarity.  The  SESP  has \nbeen  designed  to  support  ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  taking  a  longer  term  perspective  of  sector \ndevelopment  and  committing  to  a  series  of  interventions  that  focus  on  high  priority  goals  and \nmeasurable targets within a sector policy framework. ADB assistance to the education sector in \nNepal is also consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities of improving access to and quality of \neducation. The SESP supports the Millennium Development Goals of promoting gender parity in \nsecondary  education,  poverty  eradication,  and  improved  child  and  maternal  health  through  a \nbetter-educated population.  \n \nExternal  Assistance.  External  assistance  to  education  has  been  increasing  over  the \n16. \nyears. The proportion of external assistance in the total education budget increased from 7% in \nFY1992 to 26% in FY1995. In the last two decades, Nepal has received $5.5 billion in external \nassistance  for  the  education  sector  of  which  ADB  has  contributed  11%  and  the  World  Bank \n13%.  The  rest  has  come  from  other  agencies  including  Danish  International  Development \nAssistance  (Danida),  Department  for  International  Development,  European  Union,  Finland, \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Norwegian  Agency  for  International  Cooperation, \nSwiss Development Cooperation, United Nations Development Programme, and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund. \n \n17. \nBasic  education  has  received  the  largest  share  of  this  assistance  in  keeping  with  the \ngoals of education for all. Currently, there are two related interventions in basic education\uf8e7the \nmultiagency  funded  BPEP  II  and  ADB-funded  Teacher  Education  Project.  In  secondary \neducation,  the  SEDP  closed  in  June  2000;  cofinancing  by  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment continued with program support until June 2002. Details of external assistance to \nthe education sector in Nepal and lessons learned are at Appendix 4. \n \n18. \nLessons  Learned.  Valuable  experience  has  been  gained  from  these  interventions.  \nExperience from the BPEP I indicated that it did not accomplish sufficient improvements in the \nlearning and achievements of students. Teacher performance was identified as one of the key \nareas for improving quality. Review of Primary Education Development Project revealed that (i) \npoor classroom teaching practices remain a major deterrent to improving quality; (ii) one-time, \nshort-term training of teachers is inadequate to bring about changes in classroom behavior; (iii) \na  comprehensive,  coordinated,  and  well-articulated  policy  for  teacher  training  needs  to  be \ndeveloped;  (iv)  sustained,  ongoing  inputs  are  needed  for  building  professional,  administrative \nand  managerial  capacity  in  the  teacher  training  institutions;  and  (v)  greater  institutional \ncoordination  is  necessary.  Lessons  learned  from  the  SEDP  include  (i)  sustained  changes  in \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  1995.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Education  and  Health  Sectors  Assistance \n\nStrategy Study. Manila. \n\n5   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Nepal  for the Teacher Education Project. Manila.  \n\n\f5 \n\nschool  and  classroom  practices  are  possible  only  through  local  efforts  with  continued  and \nconsistent  professional  support  from  district  education  office  (DEO)  officials  and  other \nprofessionals;  (ii)  curriculum  reform  should  proceed  with  the  total  school  system  in  view;  (iii) \ndependence on a simple institution to print the enormous number of textbooks risks availability \nand quality;  (iv) long-term policy commitment is essential for bringing about radical reform in the \nSLC examination; (v) teacher training needs to be followed up with professional support to bring \nabout changes in classroom teaching-learning practices; (vi) given the crucial role of technical \nassistance  (TA)  in  the  smooth  operation  of  the  project,  ensure  that  the  TA  financed  by  other \nfunding  agencies  is  available  to  the  project  on  time  as  per  the  implementation  schedule.  The \nmidterm review mission for the BPEP II suggested strategic shifts and synergies in its program. \nIn particular, it suggested a need to (i) take a more holistic view of education in Nepal to seek \nsynergies of primary education with secondary schooling and higher education with reference to \nteacher competencies and the development of lifetime learning skills; (ii) focus on child learning \nand  development,  and  communities'  ownership  of  public  schools;  and  (iii)  change  the  roles  of \nDOE, regional education directorates (REDs), and DEOs from implementation to facilitation and \ntechnical support for communities.  \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s  own  project  evaluation  reports  indicate  that  (i)  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  institutional \ncapacity  requires  a  critical  review  to  address  the  issues  related  to  appropriateness  of \norganizational  structures,  staffing  pattern,  and  incentive  arrangements;  (ii)  project  components \naimed  at  improving  and  strengthening  crucial  educational  components,  such  as  curriculum \ndevelopment  and  staff  training,  appear  to  have  been  underemphasized  as  far  as  financial \nprovisions  were  concerned;  and  the  design  of  the  fellowship  input  was  found  to  generally  not  \noptimal because this component is normally designed during implementation and not when the \nproject  is  prepared;  and  (iii)  ADB  supervision  was  inadequate  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and \ncomposition  of  review  missions  dispatched;  the  assistance  provided  in  procurement-related \naspects,  planning,  and  implementation  of  fellowship  programs;  and  the  development  of  a \nsatisfactory mechanism for benefit monitoring and evaluation. \n \nThe preparation process for the SESP has been guided by the Government\u2019s education \n20. \npolicies, in-depth subsector analysis, and the lessons learned from past experience. The SESP \nplaces significant emphasis on (i) policy coherence, (ii) management and institutional capacity \nbuilding, and (iii) the building of synergies between primary and secondary education. It moves \nthe  process  forward  from  the  first  SEDP  to  a  more  subsector-wide  strategy  for  educational \ndevelopment. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe SESP\u2019s overall sector goal is to expand quality education suitable for the needs of \n21. \nnational development. The specific objectives are to (i) improve the quality of public secondary \neducation; (ii) improve access to public secondary education (grades 6\u221210), particularly for girls \nand  students  from  poor  and  disadvantaged  groups  and  districts;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the \neducation system for sustainable management and delivery of education. These objectives will \nbe  achieved  by  (i)  enhancing  the  internal  and  external  efficiency  of  the  secondary  education \nsubsector and promoting the relevance of secondary education to national needs; (ii) improving \nthe  learning  environment  in  schools  including  the  standards  of  learning  and  teaching,  and \nexpanding  access  for  girls  and  students  from  disadvantaged  groups;6  and  (iii)  developing  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  central  and  local  governments,  and  local  communities  for  improved \nmanagement and delivery of education.  \n                                                 \n6   An indicative list of disadvantaged groups is at Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n22. \nThe  project  area  includes  all  75  districts  of  the  country.  The  SESP  will  support  all \ndistricts  for  decentralized  planning  and  management.  Project  inputs  for  curriculum  and \nassessment  reform,  teacher  training,  and  management  and  institutional  capacity  building  will \nhave positive impact nationwide. The Project supports policy reform7 to improve the efficiency of \nschool education. The Project has a pro-poor focus. Schools in 10 poor districts will be selected \nfor intensive inputs. The districts, as well as schools within the districts, will be selected on the \nbasis  of  criteria  that  will  include  poverty  status,  presence  of  disadvantaged  communities, \nindicators  of  internal  efficiency,  remoteness,  and  a  functioning  school  management  committee \n(SMC). Select schools in the remaining 65 districts will receive less support. Assistance will be \nprovided to schools in the form of a block grant based on the school improvement plans (SIPs) \nprepared by the SMCs. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe SESP will have the three components. \n\n23. \n \n\n1. \n\nAccess: Increased Equitable Access to an Improved Learning Environment \n\n24. \nThe aim of this component is to increase equitable access, particularly for educationally \ndisadvantaged  groups  and  girls,  by  improving  the  learning  environment  in  schools  through \nimproved facilities, provision of residential accommodation for women and girls in remote areas, \nand  scholarships  for  girls  and  students  from  disadvantaged  groups.  The  component  will  be \nsupported through (i) grants for improving facilities in selected poor schools based on the SIPs, \n(ii)  improved  information  gathering  and  monitoring  of  special  needs  students  in  local \ncommunities and their participation in schools, (iii) provision of scholarships to girls and students \nfrom  disadvantaged  groups  including  students  with  disabilities  in  need  of  partial  or  full \nscholarships  through  SIPs,  and  (iv)  provision  of  residential  facilities  for  female  teachers  and \ngirls.  This  component  is  expected  to  increase  enrollment  of  girls  and  students  from \ndisadvantaged groups by (i) improving the learning environment in schools thereby enhancing \nthe perceived value of education, (ii) providing infrastructure for greater representation of female \nteachers and girls, and (iii) targeting support to girls and students from disadvantaged groups. \n \n25. \nDue to resource and capacity constraints, assistance will be provided to 150 schools in \n10 selected districts in a phased manner. In selection of districts, priority will be given to areas \nof  acute  disadvantage  after  due  consideration  of  the  security  environment  in  the  districts. \nCriteria  for  selection  of  these  districts  will  be  developed  as  a  project  launch  exercise.8  The \nselection of schools within the selected districts will be made in accordance with criteria devised \nduring midterm review of the BPEP II. Schools in the remaining 65 districts will receive a lesser \ndegree  of  assistance.  Criteria  will  also  be  developed  for  (i)  selecting  schools  for  providing \nsecure  accommodation  for  women  teachers;  (ii)  expanding  hostels  for  girl  students  at  the \nsecondary  level  from  remote  areas  complementary  to  the  BPEP  II  inputs;  and  (iii)  identifying \nbeneficiaries  for  targeted  interventions.  The  criteria  for  selection  of  individual  beneficiaries  will \nbe devised to ensure transparency through adequate publicity and community participation.  \n\n \nThe component outputs will be (i) expected rise in GER from 55% to 65% at the lower \n26. \nsecondary level and from 35% to 55% at the secondary level; (ii) increased participation of girls \nfrom  40%  to  50%;  (iii)  improved  physical  facilities  in  150  schools  in  10  selected  districts;  (iv) \nconstruction  of  125  residential  units  for  female  teachers;  (v)  scholarships  for  35,000  girls  and \n\n                                                 \n7   A matrix reflecting the impact of the SESP on policy reform is provided as Supplementary Appendix B. \n8   Danida will provide support equivalent to approximately NRs 47.5 million for project launch activities to ensure a \ntimely start to the implementation of the Project. This support will be over and above the support committed under \nthe Project.  \n\n\fstudents from disadvantaged groups, including students with disabilities, over a 5-year period; \nand  (vi)  information  on  students  with  disabilities  included  in  the  education  management \ninformation system (EMIS)  \n \n\n7 \n\nQuality \n\n2. \n \n\na. \n\nAn Improved Curriculum, Assessment, and Accessible Instructional \nMaterials \n\n \n27. \nThe  aim  of  this  component  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  education  by  (i)  developing  a \ncurriculum  more  relevant  to  the  needs  of  society,  (ii)  by  providing  supporting  instructional \nmaterials,  and  (iii)  by  improving  the  quality  and  relevance  of  student  assessment  through  a \ncombination of classroom assessment and examinations.  \n\n \n28. \nregional, and national levels.  \n\nThe  SESP  will  support  this  component  through  interventions  at  the  school,  district, \n\n \n29. \nAt  the  School  Level.  Within  the  national  curriculum  framework  schools  will  be  given \nsome  choice  to  select  curricula  elements,  textbooks,  classroom  interactions,  and  cocurricular \nactivities that meet local needs. A system of supporting the curriculum development process will \nbe  developed  at  the  local  level  through  recurrent  training  of  teachers  and  capacity  building  of \nthe SMCs. Realistic student assessment schemes for use in the classroom will be developed by \nthe  school  assessment  unit  in  the  Curriculum  Development  Center  (CDC).  Teachers  will  be \nsensitized for assessing all children without bias including children from disadvantaged groups, \nethnic  minorities,  and  girls.  Training  of  head  teachers  and  teachers  will  include  competencies \nrelated to curriculum revision, classroom research, and reporting techniques.  \n\n \n30. \nAt the District Level. Local curricula forums will be organized with representation from \nparents,  village  development  community  members,  teachers,  community  members,  and \nmembers from ethnic minorities. The district education committee (DEC) will be responsible for \nthe  operation  of  the  Grade  8  and  SLC  examination.  An  EMIS  will  be  developed  to  reflect \nsubject-based  allocation  of  teachers;  and  availability  of  curriculum,  textbooks  and  teacher \nguides  (the  location  and  responsibility  for  information  collection  at  the  district  level  will  be \ndetermined  under  the  reorganization  of  the  DEO's  covered  under  component  4).  Under  the \nsupervision  of  the  DEO,  supervisors  and  resource  persons  will  coordinate  collection  of \nquantitative and qualitative monitoring and evaluation data.  \n\n \nAt  the  Regional  Level.  The  role  of  the  regional  CDC  curriculum  committee  will  be \n31. \nstrengthened for evaluation and monitoring of curriculum- and textbook-related issues. Regional \nexamination offices will be established at the REDs to ensure the quality of the regional grade 8 \nexamination. \n \n32. \nAt  the  National  Level.  The  role  and  responsibilities  of  the  Curriculum  Development \nCouncil  will  be  expanded  to  include  assessment,  and  be  reconstituted  as  the  curriculum \ndevelopment  and  assessment  council  with  responsibility  for  policy  formulation  for  curriculum \nand  assessment.  Parallel  to  this,  a  national  curriculum  framework  will  be  developed  covering \ngrades 1\u221212. This will include a comprehensive study of the current curriculum at the document \nand classroom instruction levels. CDC will be responsible for the process of continuous review \nand  updating  of  the  national  curriculum,  but  implementation  activities  and  teacher  support \nmaterials including open learning guides will be developed at the national, regional, district, and \nlocal levels as considered appropriate. CDC will develop instructional materials appropriate for \nuse  in  lower  secondary  and  secondary  schools.  The  representation  of  CDC  in  the  design  of \nteacher  training  curriculum  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure  that  changes  in  curriculum  are \nreflected  in  the  training  curriculum.  The  school  assessment  unit  will  be  established  and  be \nresponsible for piloting a program for school-based assessment. The Office of the Controller of \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nExamination  (OCE)  will  develop  common  procedures  for  the  grade  8  examination  to  be \nconducted  by  the  REDs.  For  conduct  and  management  of  this  examination,  OCE  will  develop \ntraining  modules  for  regional  officers  and  assist  the  REDs  to  develop  training  modules  to  be \nincluded  in  the  curriculum  for  recurrent  training  of  teachers.  A  school  inspectorate  will  be \nestablished  in  MOES  to  conduct  independent  inspections  of  a  small  sample  of  schools  to \nmonitor quality. Printing facilities will be provided to strengthen capacity for domestic printing of \nquestion papers. \n\n33. \nThe  outputs  from  this  component  will  include  (i)  a  national  curriculum  framework \ncovering  grades  1\u221212;  (ii)  inclusion  of  ICT  in  the  national  curriculum  framework;  (iii)  a \nfunctioning  school  assessment  unit  within  the  CDC;  (iv)  inclusion  of  assessment  in  textbooks, \nteacher guides, and teacher training materials; and (v) a secure printing press operation, which \nwill build domestic capacity for printing of question papers.  \n \n\nb. \n\nImproved  and  Sustainable  System \nAn \nDevelopment, and Management of Teachers \n\nfor \n\nthe  Education, \n\n \n34. \nThe aim of this component is to improve learning outcomes by improving the quality of \nclassroom teaching.  This will be achieved by creating an effective and sustainable system for \nteacher education, improving training quality, and enhancing teacher competencies. \n \n35. \nteaching in the classroom, the Project will support key activities at four levels. \n\nTo improve the quality and efficiency of teacher education and to ensure more effective \n\n \n36. \nAt the School Level. A school training plan will be an integral part of the SIP exercise. \nEach school will be allocated an annual quota of training days based on the number of teachers \nin  the  school,  the  proportion  of  female  teachers,  and  the  school\u2019s  ability  to  set  and  achieve \ntargets  and  implementing  measures  to  improve  access  and  equity.  The  school  will  select  the \nteachers  for  training.  All  head  teachers  will  receive  management  training,  which  will  lead  to \nmandatory certification. Through the SIP, 1,300 scholarships will be provided mainly to females \nbut also to a small number of males from disadvantaged groups for in-service teacher training \ncertificate. Monitoring and supervision to assess the impact of training will be the responsibility \nof the SMC as part of overall monitoring within the SIP.  \n\n \n37. \nAt  the  District  Level.  The  capacity  of  the  secondary  education  development  units \n(SEDUs) will be strengthened and 10 new SEDUs will be created. Separate residential facilities \nwill  be  provided  for  women  at  all  SEDUs.  Teacher  training  will  be  provided  through  the  200 \nresource centers, each to be established for a cluster of 15\u221225 schools, which will be supported \nunder the SESP. This number includes, wherever possible, the resource centers created under \nthe  BPEP  II,  which  will  be  utilized  to  incorporate  a  role  for  lower  secondary  and  secondary \nlevels. Training to master trainers will be provided at the SEDUs by the regional master trainers. \nA management framework will be developed to define the roles of DEOs and SEDUs for training \nresponsibilities. The DEOs will be responsible for monitoring the quality of training at the SEDUs \nin their districts. \n \nAt  the  National  Level.  The  training  and  instruction  committee  will  be  reconstituted  as \n38. \nthe  national  council  for  teacher  development  (NCTD).  The  NCTD  will  be  responsible  for \nformulating policies and guidelines related to teacher development for the school sector. It will \nalso  initiate  the  development  of  a  set  of  national  teacher  competencies  and  national  teacher \ntraining  curriculum  guidelines  to  be  prepared  by  the  National  Institute  for  Education \nDevelopment  (NIED)  in  consultation  with  faculties  of  education,  and  will  include  gender \nsensitization, needs of children with disabilities, an introduction to ICT, and assessment in the \nclassroom.  To  strengthen  in-service  teacher  training  across  school  education,  the  institutions \nresponsible  for  teacher  training\uf8e7NCED,  Secondary  Education  Development  Center  (SEDEC), \n\n\f9 \n\nand DEC\uf8e7will be merged to form the NIED. At the level of secondary education, the NIED will \ndevelop  and  pilot  a  system  of  recurrent  training  to  be  implemented  at  the  resource  centers.  It \nwill  also  develop  and  implement  an  in-service  teacher  training  certificate  to  meet  the  licensing \nrequirements for teachers. The professional capacity of the NIED will be strengthened to enable \nit  to  carry  out  a  wide  range  of  training-related  activities.  NCED\u2019s  management  training \nresponsibilities will be transferred to a new institution, which will be renamed national education \nmanagement center. \n\n \n39. \nThe  outputs  from  this  component  will  include  (i)  a  consolidated,  professionally \nstrengthened institutional infrastructure for teacher training at the national, regional, district, and \nlocal  levels;  (ii)  improved  teacher  training  curriculum  and  supporting  materials;  (iii)  increased \naccess  for  females  and  members  of  disadvantaged  groups  to  teacher  training;  (iv)  improved \nmechanisms for development of policy, strategic planning, and management of teacher training; \n(v)  13,500  teachers  will  receive  in-service  training;  and  (vi)  26,000  teachers  will  receive \nrecurrent  training.  Component  outputs  will  also  include  improved  competencies  of  master \ntrainers and trainers.  \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building: Improved Institutional Capacity and Management \n\nThe  aim  of  this  component  is  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  government  agencies, \nimproved,  efficient,  and  effective  planning, \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n40. \ninstitutions,  communities,  and  schools \nmanagement, and delivery of education.  \n \n41. \n\nThis SESP will support management and institutional capacity building at four levels. \n \nAt the School Level. Head teachers will be provided mandatory 1-month training. Head \n42. \nteachers will evaluate the performance of the teachers and the performance of the head teacher \nwill,  in  turn,  will  be  evaluated  by  the  SMC,  for  which  training  will  be  provided.  Management \ntraining  will  be  provided  for  head  teachers,  SMCs,  and  village  education  committees  (VECs) \nwith  particular  emphasis  on  the  preparation  of  the  SIP.  This  training  will  provide  for  greater \nownership  among  communities  of  school  management  and  other  education  delivery \nmechanisms. Training will also be provided to support staff in schools.  \n\n \nAt  the  District  Level.  All  DEO  staff  will  be  provided  training  in  planning  and \n43. \nmanagement of education at the district level. A planning officer will be appointed to each DEO \nto  support  the  district  planning  team  and  monitoring  and  assessment  functions  of  the  DEO. \nEfforts will be made to ensure greater employment of women in the DEO as well in the training \nof DEO staff. \n \n44. \nAt  the  Regional  Level.  The  REDs  will  be  assigned  tasks  in  three  areas:  planning, \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  supervision;  teacher  training  and  teacher  management;  and \ncurriculum, assessment, and examination. The REDs will be provided with additional staff and \nfacilities to undertake these tasks. \n\n \n45. \nAt  the  Central  Level.    Subcomponent  A.  Organization  Restructuring  and  Institution \nBuilding. Within MOES, the Organizational and Personnel Training Section will function as the \nsecretariat  for  the  NCTD.  Organizational  changes  will  be  effected  within  DOE  for  improved \nmanagement  of  school  education.9  NCED,  SEDEC,  and  DEC  will  be  merged  to  form  a  single \nNIED. The management training unit within NCED will be given separate status within the NIED, \nwith  the  understanding  that  it  will  eventually  grow  into  an  independent  national  education \nmanagement  center.  Subcomponent  B.  Improve  the  Staffing  Systems.  Based  on  the  human \nresource  development  (HRD)  plan,  currently  under  preparation,  the  management  training \n                                                 \n9   These will be synchronized with the recommendations made during the midterm review of the BPEP II. \n\n\f10 \n\ndivision of the NIED will develop a short- and medium-term training plan for education managers \ntaking  into  account  urgent  needs  and  existing  capacity.  Subcomponent  C.  Improve  the \nInformation  and  Communication  System.  ICT  will  be  used  to  enable  the  digital  transfer  of \ninformation within and across both regions and institutions. The information and communication \nsystem  of  MOES  will  be  strengthened.  ICT  training  will  be  provided,  as  appropriate,  to  all \nrelevant personnel  of MOES and its allied agencies and institutions involved in the delivery of \neducation. Subcomponent D. Improve the School Supervision and Inspection System. A school \ninspection  system  will  be  developed  in  MOES,  and  inspection  teams  will  be  formed  at  the \nregional and district levels. \n\nRecognizing  that  strengthening  institutional  and  management  capacity  is  key  to  long-\n\n \nThe  outputs  from  this  component  will  include  (i)  a  rational,  consolidated  institutional \n46. \nstructure; (ii) a national council responsible for teacher training policy; (iii) a national institute for \neducation  development;  (iv)  10  new  SEDUs  and  200  resource  centers;  and  (v)  a  5-year \nmanagement and teacher training plan. The component will also result in training of 4,000 head \nteachers,  SMCs,  and  VECs  in  school  management.  All  secondary  schools  will  have  publicly \ndisplayed SIPs.  \n \n47. \nterm self-sufficiency and sustainability, substantial consulting and staff development inputs will   \nbe  provided  under  the  SESP.  Capacity  building  will  focus  on  improving  the  information \nmanagement systems for effective planning and management, as well as inputs for developing \nthe skills and expertise of the personnel of the concerned agencies and institutions in all areas \naffecting delivery of education. The heads of concerned institutions will ensure that the domestic \nand international experts work closely with counterpart staff in the institutions to ensure capacity \nbuilding through skills development. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n48. \nThe  SESP  is  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  stakeholders  and  has  been \nprepared  in  cooperation  with  Danida,  the  cofinancier  of  this  project  (Appendix  5).  Efforts  were \nmade  to  identify  potential  external  assistance  support  for  secondary  education  from  the  very \nstart and work toward a coordinated planning process. The project design followed a two-step \nprocess:  (i)  preparation  of  Secondary  Education  Development  Plan  based  on  enrollment \nprojections over a 10-year period; (ii) a core document that details a framework for support to \nsecondary education in the first phase of 5 years.  \n \n49. \nThe SESP is designed within the framework of the core document and will support the \nGovernment\u2019s  educational  reform  process.  It  incorporates  some  features  that  are  new  to \nsecondary education in Nepal. Some of these have resulted from past experience in the sector, \nparticularly of the BPEP II. Others are the result of a highly participatory process during which \nissues  of  secondary  education  were  discussed  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders.  These \nfeatures  support  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  governance  reform  strategies  and \ninclude five features. \n \n50. \nDecentralization.  Decentralization  is  a  key  plank  of  the  Government\u2019s  development \nstrategy. Decentralization mechanisms for the delivery of education will, in the initial phase, be \nmade  applicable  to  the  delivery  of  primary  education  in  five  districts  on  a  pilot  basis.  The \napplication  of  decentralized  mechanisms  to  secondary  education  is  expected  to  take  a  few \nyears. The progress in implementation of decentralization in terms of secondary education will \nbe reviewed during the midterm review of the Project. The review will make a recommendation \nfor changes in modalities for the delivery of secondary education in support of the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization policy as required. However, the SESP will provide capacity building inputs in \nsupport of decentralization to fill gaps in capacity to implement these policies. Meanwhile, lack \nof  ownership  by  communities  and  weak  supervision  by  government  agencies  are  two  major \nreasons for the poor quality of secondary education. The SESP will address these weaknesses \n\n\f11 \n\nby  strengthening  the  role  of  parents,  communities,  local  elected  bodies,  and  government \ninstitutions in school improvement planning and management. The SESP integrates the process \nfor  the  development  of  the  SIP  for  secondary  schools  with  the  SIP  exercise  being  undertaken \nunder the BPEP II for primary schools. The SESP provides substantial capacity buildings inputs \nfor decentralized planning and management. The roles and responsibilities of different agencies \nunder current policies are detailed in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n51. \nInstitutional  Restructuring  and  Capacity  Building.  Institutional  support  to  education \nhas been weak and fragmented by subsector. The SESP will rationalize the institutional setup \nby restructuring and consolidating for greater efficiency. At the national level, the institutions and \nagencies  responsible  for  teacher  training  for  primary  and  secondary  levels  will  be  merged  to \nform a single national institution (NIED). At the regional, district, and local levels, the agencies \ninvolved  in  teacher  training  will  be  strengthened  and  expanded.  DOE  will  be  reorganized  for \nmore coordinated administration of school education. Current and proposed structures of MOES \nand DOE are provided in Appendix 6. The capacity of the agencies responsible for delivery of \neducation at all levels will be strengthened through multiple inputs. \n \n52. \nPolicy. The SESP supports the conversion of the training and instruction committee into \nthe national teacher council to create a single entity for formulating policy for teacher education \nand  training  for  both  primary  and  secondary  education.  A  key  project  outcome  will  be  a \ncomprehensive teacher training policy for the school sector. This will address some of the key \nquestions  that  have  arisen  regarding  teacher  competencies  and  preservice  and  in-service \ntraining. The project inputs in the areas of curriculum, assessment, and school inspection reflect \npioneering policy direction.  \n \n53. \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology.    The  SESP  introduces  ICT  as  an \nintegral  component  of  management  and  institutional  capacity  building.  Officials  will  receive \ntraining in ICT for multiple levels of use as determined by their professional responsibility. ICT \nwill  be  used  to  strengthen  the  administrative,  planning,  and  management  capacity  of  the \ninstitutions and government agencies responsible for the delivery of education.   \n \n54. \nSocial  Targeting.  Given  the  severe  geographic,  economic,  social,  and  gender \ndisparities in access to education, the SESP will provide block grants of up to $78,000 over a 5-\nyear period to schools in 10 pilot districts that will be selected on the basis of criteria devised to \nidentify areas of maximum disadvantage. Criteria for selection of schools will include presence \nof disadvantaged communities and indicators of low efficiency such as net enrollment and girls\u2019 \nenrollment.  Schools  in  the  remaining  65  districts  will  also  be  assisted  but  at  a  reduced  level. \nAccommodation  in  selected  locations  will  be  provided  for  female  teachers.  Hostels  will  be \nprovided  for  girls  attending  secondary  schools  in  remote  areas.  The  SESP  will  initiate  special \nmeasures  for  the  recruitment  of  female  teachers  and  teachers  from  disadvantaged  groups  by \nproviding  scholarships  to  teachers  from  these  groups  to  meet  the  in-service  training \nrequirements for licensing. Need-based scholarships will be provided to girls and students from \ndisadvantaged groups including students with disabilities.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n55. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  SESP  is  estimated  at  $74.8  million  equivalent,  including  physical \nand  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost,  $9.29  million  equivalent  (12%) \ncomprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $65.5  million  equivalent  (88%)  comprises  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  The  Project  supports  civil  works,  procurement  of  vehicles,  office  equipment, \nconsulting  services,  training,  research,  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  but  excludes \nsalaries of regular project staff, rental of office space, and taxes and duties (Appendix 7).

The  term  of  the  loan  will  be  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB \nwill  finance  40%  of  the  project  costs,  including  $3.2  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$26.8 million of the local currency cost. Danida will provide a grant of $30.0 million (40% of total \ncosts), of which $23.70 million will be provided as joint financing and be administered by ADB, \nand  subject  to  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  services  and \nconsultant  selection.  $6.3  million  will  be  provided  as  parallel  financing  managed  directly  by \nDanida.  The  Government  will  provide  $14.8  million  equivalent  (20%  of  total  costs).

The  SESP \nwill  have  strong  social  benefits.  It  particularly  targets  gender  and  social  discrimination  through \ntargeted  interventions,  and  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  reducing  inequities  in  access  to \neducation.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n58. \nUnder the overall guidance of MOES, DOE will be the Executing Agency.  The Director \nGeneral  of  DOE  will  serve  as  the  project  director.  To  build  ownership,  a  separate  project \nimplementation  unit  will  not  be  set  up.  Under  the  overall  supervision  of  DOE,  the  concerned \neducation  agencies  such  as  NCED,  SEDEC,  CDC,  and  OCE  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the activities that fall under their respective jurisdiction by integrating the activities \ninto their regular work program under the overall supervision of DOE. This is expected to lead to \nstrengthened  institutional  capacity  as  well  as  greater  ownership.  The  concerned  agencies  will \nbe provided support for capacity building to enable them to take on the additional activities. The \nlong-term strategic management of the SESP will be placed with the Program Execution Board \nestablished to oversee BPEP II.  Its membership will be expanded to include a representative \nfrom the Ministry of Local Development. At the initial stages, the board may be required to meet \nseparately to direct the SESP. However, later the board may be more expediently convened to \naddress  both  the  BPEP  II  and  SESP.  An  interagency  project  management  committee  will  be \nestablished  to  monitor  the  activities  of  the  SESP  more  closely  and  ensure  coordination  of  the \nagencies involved with implementing different activities under the SESP.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n59. \nThe SESP will be implemented over 5 years beginning in 2003 and ending in 2008. The \nGovernment has assured that adequate budgetary support for the SESP will be provided. The \nannual budget allocations will follow the Government\u2019s ongoing annual strategic implementation \nplan. A detailed implementation schedule for the SESP is contained in Appendix 8. \n\n\f14 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll  procurement  services  for  the  SESP,  except  for  components  that  are  financed  by \n60. \nDanida on a parallel grant basis, will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. No contracts for \ncivil  works  are  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $1.0  million  equivalent.  International  competitive \nbidding  procedures  will,  therefore,  not  be  necessary.    Contracts  estimated  to  cost  $1.0  million \nequivalent or less will be under local competitive bidding procedures. Civil works packages for \nschool  development  works  and  maintenance  will  be  small  and  may  be  carried  out  on  a  force \naccount basis. The procurement of goods will be grouped into packages larger than $500,000 to \nbe  suitable  for  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Miscellaneous  minor  goods  that \ncannot  be  grouped  into  larger  contracts  and  cost  less  than  $500,000  per  contract  will  be \nprocured  through  international  shopping  procedures.  Minor  items  costing  less  than  the \nequivalent  of  $100,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly  following  proper  government \nprocedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. The tentative procurement packages are \nshown in Appendix 9.  \n \n61. \nThe SESP will have no negative environmental impact. In case of proposed civil works \nunder  the  SESP  all  land  will  be  screened  for  resettlement  effects  and  no  site  will  be  selected \nthat would involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate resettlement effects, \nincluding loss of income, resources, or assets for the nontitled.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n62. \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  cofinanced  under  the \nSESP  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  of  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  total  input  of  237  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  and  759  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  is  planned.  Of  this,  189  person-\nmonths of international consulting and 413 person-months of domestic consulting services will \nbe  directly  financed  by  Danida  with  grant  funds.  The  project  funds  together  with  Danida \ncofinancing  inputs  will  support  48  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  346  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  inputs.  Given  the  extensive  capacity  building  needs,  these \nconsulting inputs will cover a wide range of expertise and will result in substantial strengthening \nof  capacity  and  skills  at  the  institutional  as  well  as  administrative  and  management  levels.  In \naddition  to  these  inputs,  Danida  will  also  provide  long-term  technical  support  at  the  national \nlevel for which funding will be in addition to the SESP. \n \nThe consulting services are designed to support the SESP, as well as build longer-term \n63. \ncapacity  of  the  agencies  and  institutions  responsible  for  the  delivery  of  secondary  education. \nTherefore, the consulting services cover broad areas of expertise that include (i) curriculum and \ninstructional  materials  design,  (ii)  classroom  assessment  and  examination  reform,  (iii) \nmanagement  and  teacher  training  curriculum  and  materials  development,  (iv)  training  of \ntrainers,  (v)  special  needs  curriculum  development,  (vi)  research  and  evaluation,  (vii)  ICT \ncurriculum, (viii) EMIS development, (ix) school planning and improvement, (x) decentralization \nand management; and (xi) operation and management of printing facilities. Indicative terms of \nreference are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nDOE  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  requesting \n64. \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  It  will  establish  an  imprest  account  for  the  SESP. \nThe initial amount will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement or 10% of the loan \namount. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to \nreimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per payment and to liquidate advances \n\n\f15 \n\nmade into the imprest account in accordance with the guidelines. DOE will coordinate the timely \nrelease  of  funds.  This  is  considered  essential  because  project  activities  will  take  place  at \ndifferent locations and simple mechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly through \ndecentralized decision making, while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. Auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the annual audit report.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n65. \nThe Government, acting through MOES, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  loan.  DOE  will  (i)  maintain \nseparate  accounts  for  the  SESP;  (ii)  ensure  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited \nannually,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB;  and \n(iii) furnish to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of \naudited accounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on these.   \n \n66. \nDOE  will  submit  progress  reports  every  4  months.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  include  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including \naspects  of  quality;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  issues; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \nthe next 4 months; and (v) expected progress during the succeeding period. Within 3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  SESP,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion  report  on  the  execution  of  the  SESP  including  the  costs  and  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants.  \n \nThe  Mission  explained  the  ADB  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud \n67. \nand  corruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Independent auditors will audit project accounts annually.  \n \nUpon receipt of request from MOES for procurement and disbursement under the SESP, \n68. \nsuch  requests  will  be  shared  with  Danida  before  finalization.  Modalities  for  obtaining  Danida\u2019s \nno objection will be finalized prior to project implementation. \n\n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n69. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Management  System  (PPMS) \nHandbook,  a  shortlist  of  verifiable  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was  prepared \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  This  list  will  be  expanded  and  refined  prior  to  project \nimplementation  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  exercise  to  be  undertaken  by  Danida. \nHowever,  performance  monitoring  will  follow  a  process  approach  and  project  targets  will  be \namended  based  on  project  reviews.  PPMS  activities  will  be  conducted  periodically  to  gather \ninformation  through  multiple  sources  so  as  to  determine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for \nimplementing program activities have rendered expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. \nThe  PPMS  also  seeks  to  detect  any  deficiency  and  discrepancy  between  the  plan  and  the \nexecution of a program in using the resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be can \nbe made to update the project and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impact. The PPMS \nwill  utilize  information  from  the  EMIS,  annual  and  semiannual  reviews,  midterm  reviews,  and \nperiodic evaluations and studies.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n70. \nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews,  the  SESP  will  be  reviewed,  at  midterm,  by  the \nGovernment,  Danida,  and  ADB.  Taking  cognizance  of  the  process  approach  adopted  for \nperformance  monitoring,  the  review  will  (i)  evaluate  the  project  scope,  design,  implementation \n\n\f16 \n\narrangements,  and  institutional  processes;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed  in  any  (or  all)  of  the \nabove  areas;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  agreed  indicators  in  the  project \nframework; and (iv) identify critical issues and constraints, if any. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n71. \nContinued  economic  growth  requires  a  well-educated  population  and  workforce. \nInvestment  in  lower  secondary  and  secondary  education,  where  basic  cognitive  skills  are \nacquired  and  consolidated,  is  particularly  valuable  because  it  improves  productivity  and \nincreases  basic  welfare.  Investment  in  secondary  education  also  improves  the  quality  of,  and \nincreases the number of entrants to, higher levels of education, where higher cognitive skills are \nacquired,  with  the  resulting  improvement  of  higher  order  productivity.  Investment  in  lower \nsecondary  and  secondary  education  also  increases  the  benefits  of  other  social  services  (e.g., \neducated  women  benefit  more  from  health  services).  In  addition,  society  places  an  intrinsic \nvalue  on  education,  especially  on  basic  and  secondary  education.  The  implication  is  that \ninvestment in this subsector has potentially high returns, both for the individual and for society.  \n \n72. \nIn  Nepal,  at  present,  the  quality  of  educational  achievement  is  relatively  poor,  and \ninvestments in improving it can be expected to have significant positive returns. In the long term, \nthe  project  outcomes  are  expected  to  be  (i)  human  development  and  productivity  efficiency \nthrough greater professional qualification of teaching and managerial staff, increased numbers \nof  higher  quality  secondary  students,  and  a  workforce  prepared  for  local  production  and \ncommercial  markets;  (ii)  social  benefits  derived  from  girls'  education  such  as  lower  fertility, \nincreased  prenatal  care  utilization,  improved  health  and  nutrition  status  of  their  families,  and \nhigher educational attainment of their children; and (iii) greater redistribution gains as a result of \nits focus on low income and underserved students.  \n \n73. \nThe economic benefits of the SESP will be two-fold. First, substantial economic benefits \nare  expected  to  accrue  from  efficiency  gains.  The  cost  of  each  student  repeated  year  is  $29. \nThe SESP will lead to a reduction in repetition rates at the lower secondary and secondary by \n12% and 7% respectively by the end of the project period. Students who do not drop out in a \ngiven year increase their future wage-earning potential. Studies indicate that each extra year of \nschooling  increases  labor  productivity  and  income  earned.  Improved  quality  of  secondary \neducation  will  attract  more  primary  education  completers  to  continue  their  studies,  thus \nincreasing their wage potential. The scholarships provided under the SESP will lead to attracting \ngirls  and  students  from  other  disadvantaged  groups  to  continue  their  education  at  the  lower \nsecondary and secondary level. This will have a positive impact on their labor productivity and \nincome levels of their families helping them break out of the cycle of poverty (Appendix 11). \n \n74. \nEducation is a key means for assisting the poor break the cycle of poverty. The SESP \nhas a pro-poor focus.  About 43% of the total project cost will be provided to improve equitable \naccess by rehabilitating schools and providing scholarships for girls and disadvantaged children. \nNew classrooms will be constructed for students in rural, underserved areas where most of the \nstudents are poor. The SESP\u2019s scholarship program for girls is targeted at rural schools in the \nmost disadvantaged areas. The educational benefits of the SESP will derive from the improved \nquality  of  education  and  from  the  improved  efficiency  of  education  services.  The  SESP  is \nexpected  to  have  substantial  qualitative  benefits,  deriving  from  the  introduction  of  the  new \ncurriculum,  the  development  of  improved  textbooks  and  other  materials,  improved  training  of \nteachers,  and  licensing  of  teachers.  This  focus  on  quality  improvement  will  in  the  long  run \ncontribute  to  reduced  inequities  among  beneficiaries.  The  SESP  is  expected  to  result  in \nsignificant gains in internal efficiency, by reducing repetition and helping to induce students not \nto drop out. Improved quality, including improved internal efficiency, will also reduce the cost of \n\n\f17 \n\nsecondary  education,  thereby  freeing  up  resources  to  encourage  school  enrolment  and \nattendance among the poor. \n \n75. \nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project\u2019s  equity,  access,  and  qualitative  improvement \nprograms  will  be  the  approximately  1.3  million  current  secondary  students,  and  their \nsuccessors.  Secondary  beneficiaries  will  include  the  approximately  3,100  teacher  trainers; \n4,500  head  teachers;  12,500  teachers;  150,000  SMC,  district  development  committee,  VDC, \nand  VEC  members;  200  resource  center  managers;  and  2,700  supervisors,  planners,  and \neducation  administrators  who  will  be  the  focus  of  staff  development  programs.    About  125 \nfemale  teachers  will  be  provided  with  accommodation  facilities  in  the  remote  and  rural  areas. \nSecondary education support agencies including SEDEC, CDC, NFEC, OCE, DEC, DOE, and \nNCED,  will  benefit  from  capacity  building  programs.  Project  support  for  scholarships  for  girls \nand students from disadvantaged groups will be weighted directly to poorer regions (Appendix \n12). \n \n76. \nThe quality of students\u2019 education will be enhanced; the reduced repetition and dropout \nrates  imply  that  individuals  will  attain  higher  levels  of  educational  achievement.  The  net  result \nwill be a greater return to the students from their investment in education. Increased access will \nexpand  the  coverage  of  education,  with  greater  enrolments,  further  increasing  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries.  Secondary education graduates of improved quality will also contribute to human \ndevelopment and improved status of women by increasing the number of students qualified for \nhigher  education,  improving  living  standards  and  health,  reducing  population  growth,  and \nproviding people with the means to engage in productive employment.  \n \n77. \nThe SESP\u2019s civil works enhancements are focused in poor areas selected on the basis \nof  educational  and  economic  disadvantage,  and  therefore,  will  have  a  positive  impact  on \ninterregional equity. Within these regions the focus on civil works needs in ethnic minority and \ndisadvantaged areas will enhance intraregional equity. Although civil works will be undertaken \nfor upgrading physical infrastructure in selected schools, construction activities will be limited to \nthe  existing  school  areas,  and  sound  engineering  practices  will  be  adopted  to  minimize \nenvironmental impact such as noise, air, solid waste, and water pollution at the localized scale \nby the contractors. \n \nTo ensure that the Government\u2019s major growth and poverty reduction goals envisaged in \n78. \nthe  Tenth  Five-Year  Development  Plan  can  be  achieved,  the  Government  has  adopted  a \nstrategy of channeling limited resources within a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). \nMOES  is  one  of  the  five  core  ministries  to  have  prepared  a  detailed  MTEF  with  a  prioritized \nprogram  to  serve  as  a  bridge  between  the  annual  budgets  and  the  over  all  Tenth  Five-Year \nDevelopment  Plan  targets.  The  Project  provides  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for  a \nprogram approach. Accordingly, the Government has agreed that donor funding will be reflected \nin the MTEF and the national budget for development. MOES has forecast a 10% increase in \nthe regular budget during each year of the project implementation. The regular budget, almost \nall  of  which  is  used  for  salaries  and  school  operating  budgets,  is  the  full  responsibility  of  the \nGovernment.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  institutional  benefits  at  all  levels.  The  Project  will  support  a \n79. \ndecentralization process, consisting of examination of new roles to be performed at each level \nby  district  development  committee,  DEC,  village  development  committee,  VEC,  and  SMCs  to \nimprove  transparency,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  decision  making  and  planning.  This  will \nhelp  strengthen  planning,  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  capacity  at  the  central, \nregional,  district,  and  school  levels.  At  the  national  and  regional  levels,  the  Project  will  also \nenhance  the  capacity  to  reform  and  strengthen  curricula  and  materials,  teacher  training  and \nevaluation  systems,  and  management  support  networks.  Institutional  strengthening  at  the \nschool  level  is  wide  ranging  and  includes  planning  and  implementation  of  the  SIP,  improved \nsupport  for  teachers'  self-improvement,  establishment  of  a  support  mechanism  for  poorer \n\n\f18 \n\nRisks  \n\nstudents, strengthened provisions for maintenance of physical facilities, and improved teaching \ncapacities.  The Project\u2019s institutional benefits will also accrue at the national and regional levels \nthrough  reorganizing,  restructuring,  and  consolidating  institutions  providing  support  to  different \nsubsectors  of  school  education  with  the  objective  of  making  them  more  cohesive  and \nresponsible  for  the  needs  of  the  school  sector  as  a  whole.  Adequate  inputs  will  be  provided \nunder the Project for strengthening their administrative and professional capacity to enable them \nto move toward greater self-sufficiency.  \n \nB. \n \nCommitment.  The  Project  is  designed  to  help  achieve  the  Government's  goals  for \n80. \nimproving  the  quality  of  secondary  education  by  supporting  the  implementation  of  educational \nreforms.  Key  to  its  success  is  continued  Government  and  societal  commitment.    Given  the \nprioritization  of  education,  and  the  reiterations  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  expanding \nsecondary  education,  support  for  expansion  of  secondary  education  as  a  goal  is  unlikely  to \nwane.  \n \nStakeholder Participation. The Project has been designed with extensive stakeholder \n81. \nparticipation. The activities and actions proposed have been widely discussed and accepted as \nnecessary. There is ownership and commitment at all levels of government and within its allied \nagencies and institutions to the proposals contained in the Project. Despite this, however, there \nare certain risks that are not project-specific but could affect project performance.  \n\n \n82. \nSecurity  Situation.  The  major  risk  arises  from  the  broader  context  of  the  security \nsituation.  The  Project  aims  to  target  the  poorer  districts  for  intensive  inputs  for  improving  the \nlearning  environment.  Recently  many  poor  and  remote  districts  have  been  affected  by \ninsurgency. The selection of districts will be done after due assessment of the security situation. \nHowever,  the  security  situation  may  remain  volatile.  The  implications  of  either  a  failure  to \ncommence  in  selected  districts,  or  the  need  to  pull  out  before  interventions  have  been \ncompleted will need to be assessed. The Project has built in the flexibility to assess the security \nsituation  before  making  geographically  targeted  interventions.  However,  since  poor  quality  of \neducation in public schools is an important plank of the insurgency agenda, a program that aims \nto improve the quality of public schools with the active participation of the community and with \nvisible positive impact may not encounter resistance.   \n \n83. \nSustainability.  The  Project  will  generate  continuing  additional  incremental  cost  of \napproximately $0.5 million annually after the project period. This incremental cost will accrue on \naccount of operation and maintenance of facilities and equipment, and salary costs for positions \ncreated  for  institutional  consolidation  and  strengthening.  These  costs  will  be  in  continuation  of \nrecurrent  costs  the  Government  will  support  during  project  implementation.  The  Government \nhas  committed  to  continuing  budgetary  provision  for  the  recurrent  costs.  Despite  the  severe \nresource  constraints,  budgetary  support  to  education  is  being  maintained.  A  combination  of \nincreased  resources  for  security  and  a  decline  in  revenues  could  have  a  negative  impact  on \nresource allocations for education, as well as on the timely availability of counterpart funds. This \nmay  necessitate  a  review  of  project  design  and  changes  where  necessary  without  a  major \nimpact  on  broad  project  objectives.  However,  some  project  gains,  particularly  those  that \nstrengthen  capacity;  improve  the  curriculum,  classroom  assessment,  and  examination;  and \nimprove teacher competencies, will have long-term beneficial impact and are not susceptible to \nshort-term resource constraints.  \n \n84. \nContinuity  of  Pesonnel.  Frequent  changes  of  senior  civil  servants  could  affect  the \noverall direction and continuity of the Project. Of late, trends in continuity of personnel both at \nthe  ministry  level  and  related  agencies  have  been  positive.  Success  of  the  capacity  building \ninputs  will,  however,  depend  upon  institutional  leadership  and  continuity  of  personnel.  The \nProject will continue to emphasize this aspect with Government from time to time.  \n\n\f \n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n85. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n19 \n\n(i) \n\nDistricts for intensive project inputs will be selected in accordance with criteria \nto  be  developed  under  the  Danida  funded  interim  project  and  approved  by \nMOES. \n\n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOES  will  establish  a  school \ninspectorate  with  a  mandate  to  monitor  educational  quality,  and  8  positions \nwill  be  approved.  To  the  extent  possible,  two  positions  will  be  given  to \nwomen. \n\n(iii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, criteria will be developed for eligibility \nfor  (a)  student  scholarships,  (b)  scholarships  for  in-service  teacher  training, \nand (c) scholarships for out-of-country training. The criteria for each category \nwill  prioritize  scholarships  for  female  candidates  and  candidates  from \ndisadvantaged groups, including those with disabilities. Among these, equally \nqualified women will be given first priority. The criteria will be subject to prior \napproval by ADB and Danida. DOE will ensure wide distribution of application \nforms  for  the  scholarships,  including  the  eligibility  criteria,  among  the  target \ngroups. \nDOE will ensure that the SMCs, or in their absence the VECs, will identify the \nfirst  group  of  scholarship  students  within  but  not  later  than  2  months  before \nthe  commencement  of  the  school  year  following  the  development  of  the \ncriteria. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  CDC  will  establish  a  school \nassessment  unit  with  a  mandate  to  develop  schemes  for  classroom \nassessments  for  students.  These  schemes  will  be  developed  within  18 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. \nCDC will be involved in the development of teacher training modules through \ncurriculum \nrepresentation  on  curriculum  development \ncommittees wherever necessary. \n\nreviews  and \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, MOES will merge NCED, SEDEC, and \nDEC  into  the  NIED  to  serve  as  the  apex  organization  for  teacher \ndevelopment  for  the  entire  school  sector.  The  management  training  division \nof  NCED  will  become  a  separate  unit  until  its  eventual  evolvement  into  an \nindependent national education management center. \n\n(viii)  Prior  to  the  reorganization  of  the  educational  institutions,  a  staffing  need \nassessment  will  be  prepared  for  that  institution,  including  a  plan  for \nredeployment of staff as appropriate. \nDOE will be reorganized as per the recommendations of the midterm review \nof  BPEP  II,  and  a  school  division  will  be  established  covering  both  primary \nand secondary education. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  training  for  head  teachers  will  be  made \nmandatory.  The  selection  process  of  head  teachers  will  include  affirmative \naction for equally qualified women. \n\n(xi)  Within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  NIED  will  develop  a  curriculum  for  10-\nmonth  preservice  professional  training  for  teachers  for  lower  secondary  and \nsecondary  education.  For  in-service  teachers,  an  equivalent  training  will  be \nmandated for licensing. The content as well as delivery modalities, including \n\n\f20 \n\n86. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\ncredits for the number of years\u2019 experience, will be developed within 2 years \nof loan effectiveness. \nThe  Government  will  take  appropriate  measures  to  staff  the  following \npositions either through redeployment or new recruitment: (a) 75 staff for the \nSEDUs;  (b)  75  district  planning  officers;  (c)  5  staff  for  CDC;  (d)  2  staff  for \nOCE; (e) 4 staff for the REDs; (f) 2 staff for NIED; and (g) 2 staff for DEC. In \ncase of new recruitment, priority will be given to equally qualified women. \n\n(xii) \n\n \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following conditions will be met before the loan becomes effective: \n\nThe Government will have amended the Education Rules to reflect the following: \n(i) the upgrading of the Training and Instruction Committee to the NCTD with an \nexpansion  of  its  mandate  to  cover  the  entire  the  school  sector;  and  (ii)  the \nreconstitution  of  the  Curriculum  Development  Council  as  the  Curriculum \nDevelopment  and  Assessment  Council  with  an  expansion  of  its  mandate  to \ninclude policy formulation for curriculum development and assessment. \nThe  governments  of  Nepal  and  Denmark  will  have  entered  into  an  agreement \nrelating  to  a  grant  contribution  to  the  Project  under  a  cofinancing  scheme  with \nADB. \n\n \nArrangements satisfactory to ADB and Danida for administration of the Danida grant by \n\n87. \nADB will have been concluded between Danida and ADB. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n88. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve for the Secondary Education Support Project  \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 22,685,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Nepal  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$23,700,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of \nDenmark. \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n29 August 2002 \n \n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nDesign  \nSummary \n\nSector Goal \n \nTo expand quality \neducation suitable for the \nneed of national \ndevelopment \n \n\nPerformance  \nIndicators/Targets \n\n \n \n\u2022  Improved quality and access \n\nindicators by 2007 \n\nPurpose \n \n1.

The key issues that impact quality of secondary education are \nas follows: \n\n \nThe School Curriculum \n\nExaminations \n\nA. \n \n2. \nThe curriculum has been criticized for an academic emphases; no provision for local and \nregional  flexibility;  domination  by  the  school  leaving  certificate  (SLC)  examination;  and  as  a \nconsequence  the  students  have  to  resort  to  rote  learning;  few  opportunities  for  practical \nactivities and not related to the labor market. \n \nCurriculum  reform  was  a  major  focal  point  of  the  Secondary  Education  Development \n3. \nProject  (SEDP).  The  overall  structure  of  the  curriculum  was  left  untouched  by  SEDP,  as  the \nproject focused exclusively on revising the curriculum of existing subjects. Evaluations suggest \nthat  the  SEDP  was  highly  influential  in  developing  and  implementing  a  less  overloaded,  more \nstudent centered, and more activity-oriented curriculum for grades 9 and 10. The textbooks for \nthese  grades  are  of  a  higher  technical  and  educational  quality  than  those  for  the  previous \ncurriculum.  This  points  to  the  need  to  undertake  a  fairly  comprehensive  revision  of  the  lower \nsecondary curriculum. \n \n4. \nThe  role  of  vocational  education  at  the  school  level  has  been  extensively  debated  and \nthere  is  consensus  that  the  technological  advancement  and  globalization  of  the  economy \ndemands that education be life-skill oriented to enable students to make a meaningful economic \ncontribution.  Community  and  political  support  for  a  more  relevant  job-orientated  curriculum  is \nstrong. Demand for computer education in public school is growing.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nClassroom assessment of student learning is embryonic in Nepal. There is a district level \nexamination  at  the  end  of  lower  secondary  school  (grade  8).  Much  more  important  than  the \ngrade 8 examination, is the SLC at grade 10. This examination, with its heavy emphasis on rote \nlearning,  has  considerable  negative  influence  on  the  teaching-learning  processes.  An \nexamination  pass  is  connected  to  future  public  and  private  career  possibilities  and  to  social \nprestige. \n \nThe SEDP evaluation report suggests that the capacity to ensure increased validity and \n6. \nreliability  in  assessment  has  increased  in  the  Office  of  the  Controller  of  Examination  (OCE), \nalthough not sufficiently. Pass rates at the SLC have been improving over the last decade and \nin 1999 close to 50% of the regular candidates passed. However pass rates vary considerably \nevery  year,  as  the  criterion  in  each  subject  is  to  obtain  32%  of  the  marks  and  it  has  proved \ndifficult to ensure that examination papers are of the same level of difficulty every year. The first \nSLC  examination  according  to  the  new  curriculum  took  place  in  2001,  and  created  further \nproblems.  First,  it  took  about  one  more  month  to  publish  the  results;  second  the  pass  rate \ndropped to 31.6%; and third, there was dissatisfaction with the parallel sets of questions, due to \nstriking  differences  in  the  level  of  difficulty.  It  follows  that  more  work  needs  to  be  done  on  the \nSLC. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nAt  lower  secondary  level,  trainee  teachers  are  supposed  to  complete  12  years  of \neducation, 10 years of which is purely academic and 2 years of which is a mixture of academic \nand pedagogical training. The majority of lower secondary teachers spend these 2 years at one \n\nTeacher Development \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nof  the  campuses  of  Tribhuvan  University  where  they  reach  proficiency  certificate  level  (PCL). \nMost  trained  teachers  in  the  secondary  sector  receive  their  initial  training  at  Tribhuvan \nUniversity.  To become qualified secondary teachers trainees can either take a 3-year Bachelor \nof  Education  or  a  3-year  Bachelor  of  Arts  or  Bachelor  of  Science,  followed  by  a  one  year \nBachelor  of  Education.  The  majority  of  teachers  currently  entering  the  system  have  no \nprofessional  training.    In  1999  24,696  teachers  were  teaching  at  the  lower  secondary  level \n(16,645 untrained), and 19,185 teaching at the secondary level (9,477 untrained). At the higher \nsecondary level, most teachers are temporary and/or part-time. \n \nSerious challenges relate to the education of lower secondary and secondary teachers. \n8. \nAlthough the majority of the teachers (95%) for these levels are academically qualified for their \njobs, many lack qualifications in one or more of the subjects they teach. Further, two thirds of \nthe lower secondary teachers and one half of the secondary teachers do not have the required \ntraining. In spite of official attempts to enroll more women in the teaching force, the proportion of \nfemales for the lower secondary and secondary levels remains around 10%. \n \n9. \nPreservice training is the responsibility of the Faculty of Education (FOE). FOE is often \ncriticized  for  its  low  academic  standard,  so  much  so  that  even  if  trained  candidates  are \navailable, schools are reported to prefer teachers who have earned their degrees in other fields \nthan  in  education.  There  are  two  main  reasons  for  this.  First,  some  of  the  campuses  are  very \nsmall  and  have  few  physical  and  human  resources  to  provide  high-quality  teacher  education. \nSecond,  the  FOE  courses  are  not  primarily  teacher  education  courses,  but  rather  academic \ncourses in education that focus only to a limited extent on the professional competencies of the \nprospective teachers, in spite of the fact that about 50% of the graduates go into teaching. The \nFOE-courses do not reflect the emphases of the secondary school curriculum. \n \n10. \nIn-service training courses take place at the 25 secondary education development units \n(SEDUs). Presently the SEDUs train about 5,000 teachers a year. In general they provide 6\u22127 \nmonths of training a year. The number of trainees in SEDUs has fallen over the past 4 years, a \ndevelopment  which  may  reflect  the  difficult  financial  situation  of  the  SEDUs.  The  SEDUs  are \nstrongly  dependent  on  development  assistance  and  cannot  become  financially  sustainable \nwithout such input in the foreseeable future. \n \nThe  problems  faced  by  the  SEDUs  include  (i)  small  size,  inadequately  equipped,  and \n11. \nlimited resources for maintenance and replacement of materials; (ii) understaffed, with only two \npermanent  posts  of  the  chief  and  an  assistant;  (iii)  reliance  on  external  trainers  who  are \nsecondary  teachers  from  nearby  schools;  (iv)  trainers  and  trainees  are  selected  often  for \npolitical reasons, which leads to a lack of commitment; and (vi) the training is not sufficient for \nthe teachers to become formally trained and there is little incentive for them to participate. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe educational management structure is the result of government efforts over the past \nfive decades to establish a sound management system for the national education system. The \nprincipal  tasks  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports  (MOES)  are  planning,  policymaking, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  Currently  too  many  institutions  report  directly  to  MOES  and  this \nresults in too little time being spent on policymaking and planning tasks.  \n \n13. \nThe  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  is  responsible  for  administration  of  school \neducation.    The  five  regional  education  directors  and  75  DEOs  report  directly  to  the  director \ngeneral of DOE.  The present structure of DOE appears to have a visible bias in favor of primary \neducation  and  educational  administration.  The  regional  education  directorates  (REDs)  created \nto decentralize school management are shrinking in terms of their responsibilities and authority. \nThey need to be strengthened within identified parameters.  The education offices in each of the \n\nManagement and Organizational Structures \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n75 districts are headed by DEOs which are supervised by the REDs. The DEO also reports to \nthe  chief  district  officer  and  to  the  chair  of  the  district  development  committee  while  playing  a \npivotal role as a member secretary of the district education committee. Head teachers operate \nunder  the  supervision  of  the  DEO.  Each  school  has  a  school  management  committee  (SMC) \nwith  a  supervisory  responsibility.  The  SMC  keeps  the  schools  closer  to  the  community  that  it \nserves.  Current  intent  and  practice  regarding  supervision  do  not  match,  for,  in  effect,  schools \nand head teachers are largely unsupervised.   \n \n14. \nHuman  resource  development  programs  have  been  offered  for  almost  five  decades  to \nimprove  professional  skills  of  the  staff  of  government  agencies  and  institutions.  These  have \nbeen  project-funded,  have  emphasized  short-term  training  related  to  project  targets,  and  have \nplayed  a  critical  role  in  achieving  targets.  During  the  past  few  years,  some  middle  level \nexecutives  have  been  provided  with  masters  and  doctorate  training  in  Denmark,  and \nscholarships at Kathmandu University and Tribhuvan University for higher degree programs. A \nnew draft human resource plan developed by MOES will be implemented through the National \nCenter for Educational Development. \n \nA  review  of  the  status  of  the  major  computer-based  information  systems  operational \n15. \nwithin  the  education  system  raises  development  issues  that  need  to  be  considered  within  the \ncontext  of  institutional  information  and  communication  technology  policy.  Systems  included  in \nthe  review  include  the  DOE  web-site,  the  education  management  and  information  system  (of \nannual  school  statistics),  school  mapping  and  district  planning,  school  physical  improvement \nplanning, secondary teacher information system, the Kitabkhana (school teacher records), and \nthe  SLC  and  higher  secondary  examination  processing  system.    No  systematic  collection \nmechanisms  are  in  place  for  university,  nonformal,  and  teacher  training  education  statistics. \nCritical  problems  that  emerge  from  the  review  are  the  inadequate  data  flows  and  use  of \ninformation that does exist. Tackling these issues requires institutional changes that put a much \nhigher emphasis on the value of information and access to it. \n \nE. \n\nSummary: Major Issues \n\n \n16. \nAnalyses  of  the  education  system  indicate  that  it  faces  serious  challenges.  Challenges \nidentified include low levels of educational attainment, unequal participation in schooling across \nincome  and  social  groups,  high  repetition  and  dropout  rates  throughout  the  system,  and  a \ngenerally low quality of education that does not serve the labor market well.   \n \n17. \nFurther challenges include a teaching force that is poorly managed, poorly trained, or not \ntrained at all, often teaching subjects for which they are not qualified; an overloaded curriculum \nand weak assessment system; weak management and institutional capacity; inadequate public \nresources for education that are inappropriately distributed; and a system of financial allocation \nthat encourages neither efficiency nor generation of additional resources. \n \n18. \nAnother  issue  of  concern  at  the  secondary  level  is  whether  it  should  include  grades \n6\u221210, 6\u221212, or 9\u221212. The problem of the schooling system is not in the lower grades but at the \nterminal  end  where  more  uniformity  is  necessary.  The  debate  is  one  that  can  only  take  place \nwithin a sector framework. Access, equity, and relevance are at the core of the debate on the \nfuture  structure  of  the  sector  that  needs  to  be  addressed  in  a  whole  sector,  rather  than  a \nsubsector, perspective. \n\n\fPROBLEM ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY EDUCATION SUBSECTOR \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nSystem inefficiency \nwith high repetition and \ndropout rates at

\n\n\u2022  Critical capacity building, \n\n\u2022 \n\nparticularly of new institutions, \nshould be undertaken in advance \nof project activities. \nInstitutional strengthening needs \nto be given

Investment in lower secondary and secondary \neducation, where basic cognitive skills are acquired and consolidated, is particularly valuable because it \nimproves  basic  productivity  as  well  as  increases  basic  welfare.  Investment  in  secondary  education  also \nimproves the quality of, and increases the number of entrants to, higher levels of education, where higher \ncognitive skills are acquired, with the resulting improvement of higher order productivity. Significant social \nbenefits  are  derived  from  girls\u2019  education  such  as  lower  fertility,  improved  health  and  nutrition  status  of \ntheir families, and higher education attainment of their children leading to intergenerational benefits. The \nimplication  is  that  investment  in  this  education  subsector  potentially  has  high  returns,  both  for  the \nindividual and for society.  \n \n \n \nB. \nAnalysis: \n \nPoverty studies have been carried out in Nepal. The Mission relied on studies conducted under TA 3526-\nNEP  on  Access  to  Education  for  Disadvantaged  Children  and  Disabled  Children;  Government\u2019s  interim \nthe \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper;  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  with \nGovernment;  A  social  assessment  survey  of  disadvantaged  groups  conducted  under  3217-NEP  for  the \nTeacher  Education  Project  for  the  Teacher  Education  Project;  UNDP\u2019s  Nepal  Human  Development \nReport as well as studies conducted by local experts.  \n \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared                                                                                                             Yes \n \nThe stakeholder analysis prepared during the feasibility study is in line with the Government\u2019s proposed \ndecentralization  policies  devolving  power  to  local  bodies.  school  management  committees  (SMCs) \nconsisting of parents and teachers represent the major stakeholders. They will work in close cooperation \nwith education administrators for improved delivery of education with greater accountability.  \n \nParticipation strategy :                                                                                                                          Yes \n \nSMCs will be strengthened for more effective management and delivery of education at the school level. \nTheir  capacity  will  be  strengthened  for  preparing  school  improvement  plans  (SIPs)  based  on  which \nschools  will  receive  assistance.  SMCs  will  select  candidates  for  scholarships.  Training  will  be  provided \nacross all levels for improved management and delivery of education.  \n \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nSocial Issues \n\nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlementb \nGender \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nNone \n\nNot significant \nSignificant \n\nAffordability \n\nNot significant  \n\nNot significant  \nSignificant  \n\nLabor \nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \n \nOutput Prepareda \n\nCovenanted \nIncentives provided to females to \npromote greater demand for education \nRecurrent costs as a consequence of \nthe Project are minimal \n \nTargeted area inputs as well as scholarships \nfor disadvantaged groups \n \n\nNone \nYes \n\n \n\nNo \nYes, No \n\nNone \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT \n \n\nEconomic Benefits of the Project \n\n1. \nDespite  considerable  progress  made  in  education  in  Nepal  over  the  last  two  decades, \nthe gross enrolment ratio (GER) at the lower secondary and secondary school level is 55% and \n35%  respectively.  Girls  constitute  only  41%  with  considerable  variation  in  participation  by \ngender, as well as by social and income group, across the regions and ecological zones. The \nquality  of  education  also  varies  substantially.  Approximately  two  thirds  of  lower  secondary \nteachers  and  one  half  of  secondary  teachers  are  untrained,  and  most  teachers  at  the  higher \nsecondary level are only employed on a part-time or temporary basis. \n \n2. \nIn  Nepal  as  elsewhere,  correlation  between  educational  development  and  reduction  in \nthe incidence of poverty, improvement in labor productivity, economic growth, and the quality of \nlife is strong. Relevant curriculum, improved pedagogical skills and teachers\u2019 competencies, and \nstrengthened  management  of  secondary  education  will  all  serve  to  enhance  the  quality  of \neducation  and  cost-effectiveness  of  public  and  household  spending  on  secondary  schooling. \nWith  improved  quality,  parents  will  be  more  inclined  to  send  their  children  to  school,  and \nstudents  will  be  increasingly  motivated  to  stay  in  school  and  complete  their  secondary  school \neducation. Student dropouts and repetitions will decrease, and more students will successfully \ncomplete grades on a year-to-year basis and finalize their grade 8 and school leaving certificate \n(SLC)  certificates.  In  supporting  the  development  of  a  better-educated  work  force  and \npopulation,  the  Project  in  turn  supports  the  acceleration  of  Nepal\u2019s  transition  to  a  more \ntechnologically advanced agriculture and industrial-based economy and the strengthening of its \neconomic development.  \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  improve  access  and  equity  of  access,  and  the  quality  and \nefficiency  of  secondary  education  in  Nepal  under  four  project  components:  Component  1: \nIncreased  Equitable  Access  to  an  Improved  Learning  Environment;  Component  2:  Improved \nand Relevant Curriculum; Component 3: Improved and Sustainable System for the Education, \nDevelopment, and Management of Teachers; and Component 4: Improved Institutional Capacity \nand Management.  \n \n4. \nThe  Project\u2019s  design  focus  on  quality  improvements  will  establish  the  necessary \nfoundation  for  a  more  efficient  secondary  education  system.  Key  improvements  that  will \ncontribute to the establishment of relevant, better quality education include the development of a \ncurriculum  that  appropriately  addresses  the  employment  and  economic  needs  of  the  country, \nthe development of a new teacher education system and student assessment system, and an \nemphasis  on  improving  teacher  capacities.  Enhanced  quality  will  also  improve  retention  and \npromotion  rates.  For  each  year  repetition  can  be  averted,  government  education  expenditure \nand  household  expenditure  can  be  reduced  by  an  estimated  $28  and  $18  (at  2000  prices) \nrespectively  per  student  year  reduced.  For  each  dropout  averted,  an  increase  in  the  overall \nfinancial  and  economic  returns  of  the  investment  will  be  realized  as  a  result  of  the  graduate\u2019s \nimproved wage potential and positive economic and social externalities gained from increased \neducation.  \n \n5. \nThe  economic  assessment  is  focused  on  reviewing  the  impact  of  targeted  project \ninterventions and provides an indicative estimate of first round economic effects based on data \nprovided by the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) and the findings of a number of recent \nstudies  in  Nepal.  The  estimated  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  increased  access  and \nequity of access to lower secondary and secondary education; increased general enrollment as \na  result  of  improved  quality  and  effectiveness  of  public  secondary  education  delivery;  and \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\nincreased efficiency of public secondary education in terms of reduced dropout rates, reduced \nrepeat  rates,  and  increased  completion  rates.  Economic  benefits  are  estimated  in  accordance \nwith the following assumptions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthrough  a \n\ntargeted  scholarship  program  and \n\nImproved  access  and  equity  of  access  to  lower  secondary  and  secondary \nschools is achieved for educationally disadvantaged groups, particularly girls and \nethnic  minorities \nimproved \nsensitization of teachers and curriculum to their specific needs. \nDefined GER project targets for lower secondary and secondary schools of 65% \nand 55% are respectively achieved by the end of the Project in 2007. \nRepetition rates for lower secondary and secondary schools are reduced by 12% \nand 7% respectively by the end of the Project in 2007. \nDropout  rates  for  lower  secondary  and  secondary  schools  are  reduced  by  12% \nand 14% respectively by the end of the Project in 2007. \nPrivate  rates  of  return  for  wage  earners  increases  for  each  year  of  lower \nsecondary  and  secondary  school  completed  by  8.5%  and  10%  respectively, \nadjusted for real growth in wage rates equal to 4% annually. \n\n \n6. \nThe estimated direct costs of the Project comprise the project investment, the public and \nprivate  cost  of  providing  each  addition  pupil-year,  and  the  opportunity  cost  of  retaining  each \nstudent  in  school  an  additional  year.  Public  costs  are  estimated  equal  to  government \nexpenditure  per  pupil  attending  public  secondary  schools,  that  is,  $28,  and  private  costs  are \nthose  incurred  by  the  families  of  each  pupil  on  school  fees,  books  and  school  supplies, \ntransportation, etc., estimated at $18. The opportunity cost of retaining each student in school \nfor  an  additional  year  is  estimated  at  $462,  that  is,  equal  to  the  basic  wage  rate  assuming \ncompletion  of  primary  school  and  adjusted  for  real  growth  in  the  wage  rate  equal  to  2% \nannually.  \n \nBased on the assumptions stated the project yields an economic internal rate of return \n7. \n(EIRR)  of  14%.  The  real  rate  of  return  is  likely  to  be  quite  a  bit  higher  reflecting  positive \nexternalities  and  long-term  intergenerational  social  benefits  that  are  generated  by  education, \nsuch as fertility rates and improved health outcomes that are difficult to assign monetary values \nto.

As  a  result  of  these  events,  and  in  light  of  it\u2019s \neroding  fiscal  situation,  Nepal\u2019s  development  paradigm  and  fiscal  priorities  have  changed \nsignificantly. Ensuring internal security is considered a priority without which development and \neconomic progress will be limited.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\n9. \nThe  strategy  of  the  Government  is  to  \u201charness  and  channel  limited  resources  within  a \nmedium-term  framework  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  major  growth  and  poverty  reduction \noutcomes  envisaged  in  the  Tenth  Plan  [can]  be  achieved.\u201d1  In  support  of  this  strategy,  MOES \nand each of the other five-core line ministries, have prepared sectoral medium-term expenditure \nframeworks (MTEFs), which detail actionable prioritized programs to serve as a bridge between \nannual budgets and the Tenth Plan.   \n \n10. \nUnder  MOES\u2019s  MTEF  the  estimated  2001/02  budget  for  the  SESP  is  $38.1  million,  of \nwhich  $37.4  million  is  for  the  regular  budget  (an  estimated  76%  of  which  is  allocated  for \nteachers  salaries)  and  $0.7  million  is  for  the  development  budget  (comprised  solely  of  foreign \ngrant).  For  the  regular  budget  (recurring  costs)  this  reflects  an  almost  15%  increase  over  the \nrevised  budget  for  FY2000/01,  which  in  turn  reflects  an  increase  of  over  40%  over  the  actual \nbudget  for  FY1999/2000.  In  contrast,  the  development  budget,  i.e.,  in  terms  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  self-generated  resources,  has  fallen  from  $0.1  million  in  FY1999/2000  to  no \nbudget  allocation  for  both  FY2000/01  and  2001/02.  For  those  fiscal  years,  the  development \nbudget  was  comprised  entirely  of  a  foreign  loan  of  $1.1  million  in  FY1999/2000  and  foreign \ngrants of $0.7 million for each of FY2000/01 and FY2001/02.  \n \n11. \nThe  Project  provides  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for  a  program  approach. \nAccordingly, external assistance funding will be reflected in the MTEF and the national budget \nfor  development.  The  MTEF  forecast,  amended  for  the  Project,  is  presented  in  Table  A11.2. \nUnder the MTEF, MOES has forecast a 10% annual increase in the Project\u2019s regular budget for \neach year presented, i.e., FY2002/03 to FY2006/07.  \n \n\nTable A11.2: Budget for the Secondary Education Support Project  \n($ Million) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n Item \n\n    Government \n\n    External Grant \n\n    External Loan \n\n2.
