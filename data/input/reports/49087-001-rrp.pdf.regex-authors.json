THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to B1,506,000,000 (or its equivalent in US dollars) to Thai-Sunseap Asset Company \nLimited for the Grid-Parity Rooftop Solar Project in Thailand.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  As of July 2016, Thailand\u2019s installed power generation capacity was 41,097 megawatts \n(MW). Generation depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 65% produced by natural gas \nand 18% produced by coal and lignite, with only 6% produced by renewable energy sources \n(excluding  large  hydroelectric  power  plants).  Natural  gas  has  traditionally  been  Thailand\u2019s \nreliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling reserves in the Gulf \nof Thailand mean the country must transition toward securing alternative sources. As part of its \nstrategy to diversify the energy mix and promote renewable energy, the Government of Thailand \nprepared the Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u20132036,2 which (i) notes the significant \npotential of solar power in Thailand, and (ii) indicates that energy imports can be avoided \nthrough developing domestic solar projects with private investment. The plan aims to increase \nthe share of renewable energy used for power generation to 30%, including the installation of \n19,684 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW coming from solar power. \n \n3.  To  implement  Strategy  2020  and  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for \nThailand of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which emphasize support for clean energy, \nADB  identified  the  opportunity  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  the  project  through  close \ncooperation and strong relationships with various sponsors and financial institutions in Thailand \nbuilt over the last 5 years. Since its early engagement in the project, ADB has played a key role \nin devising the financing structure of \u2018single loan, multiple projects\u2019, which significantly reduces \ntransaction costs, improves project viability, and enhances scalability of the business model, \nand played a catalytic role of mobilizing investment from local commercial banks.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project involves the rollout and operation of multiple solar photovoltaic installations, \neach with a capacity ranging from 400 kilowatts-peak to 10 megawatts-peak (MWp), on rooftops \nor elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings owned or leased by host \ncompanies in Thailand up to an aggregate capacity of 100 MW and will be installed at no up-\nfront cost to the host companies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n5.  The project has strong potential to be scaled up, particularly in Thailand\u2019s growing \nmanufacturing sector. Host companies will maintain connections to the national grid to augment \ntheir power supply, and they will benefit from the project in the following ways: (i) discounted \nelectricity prices, (ii) more reliable electricity supply, (iii) avoidance of having to pay the up-front \n                                                             \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2015. Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u2013\u20132036. Bangkok. ", "2  \ncosts associated with developing their own solar power facilities, (iv) reduced emissions, and \n(v) an improved corporate image. The project offers attractive benefits for Thailand, including \n(i) helping  it  reach  its  renewable  energy  target  by  scaling  up  grid-parity  solar  power;  and \n(ii) increasing  its  use  of  distributed  generation  (i.e.,  power  that  is  generated  where  it  is \nconsumed), thereby reducing the need to upgrade and maintain grid infrastructure. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n6.  Since its early engagement in the project, ADB has played a key role in devising the \nfinancing structure of \u2018single loan, multiple projects\u2019, where the financing contemplated will be \nused to support multiple solar projects on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial \nand/or industrial buildings that have been traditionally difficult to finance individually due to their \nsmaller size. This structure significantly reduces the transaction costs borne by each subproject, \nthereby  increasing their  stand-alone  viability  and  enhancing  the  scalability  of  the  business \nmodel of grid-parity solar projects that do not require FIT subsidies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n  \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n7.  The borrower of the project is Thai-Sunseap Asset Company Limited, a special purpose \nproject company 55% owned by Weng Holding, Sombath Phanichewa and his immediate family \nmembers, and 45% by Sunseap Group. Thai-Sunseap Asset Company Limited will own and \noperate 100% of the subprojects up to an aggregate capacity of 100 MW. \n \n8.  Weng Holding is a privately held company that is part of an industrial conglomerate (the \nWeng Group) led by a prominent Thai businessman, Sombath Phanichewa. S. Phanichewa is \nthe chairman of the board of Don Muang Tollway, which operates the elevated toll road from \nBangkok metropolitan and the northern vicinities as the main and direct route to the center, \nnorthern, and northeastern parts of Thailand under a concession granted by the Department of \nHighways.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n9.  Sunseap Group is a leading developer and the largest owner of solar rooftop systems in \nSingapore, with more than 163 MWp of contracted capacity. It has won five out of six solar \ntenders called by the Government of Singapore to date to install photovoltaic panels on the \nrooftops of a number of public housing and other government properties.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n10.  Impacts. The project will demonstrate the viability of the business model of grid-parity \nrooftop solar projects on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial \nbuildings that do not require FIT subsidies in Thailand. The project will also contribute to the \ndiversification  of  Thailand\u2019s  energy  mix  by  adding  alternative  energy  capacity  and  more \nelectricity consumption from renewable sources, thus helping the country progress toward its \nrenewable energy target.  \n ", "  3\n11.  Outcome. The outcome will be the sustained operation of the private sector grid-parity \nrooftop solar business model in Thailand. \n \n12.  Output.  The  output  will  be  the  rollout  and  operation  of  multiple  solar  photovoltaic \ninstallations on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings, \nwith a total capacity of up to 100 MW. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n13.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020. 3  The  review  reaffirmed  ADB\u2019s  support  under  Strategy  2020  for \n(i) environmentally sustainable development; (ii) the role of the private sector in meeting growing \nenergy demand in the region; and (iii) capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure \ndevelopment, finance, and other areas.4 The midterm review also supported the expansion of \nenvironment-friendly technologies for clean and efficient energy-generation and use, as well as \na larger role for private sector financing of infrastructure. \n \n14.  Consistency  with  country  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for  Thailand,  which  supports  three  core  strategic  pillars: \n(i) knowledge and innovation, (ii) private sector development, and (iii) regional cooperation and \nintegration. These strategic pillars are operationalized in four program areas: (i) infrastructure; \n(ii) finance sector development; (iii) environment, including climate change; and (iv) regional \ncooperation and integration.5 The government\u2019s Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u2013\n2036 sets a target of increasing the share of renewable energy and alternative energy used for \npower generation to 30% by 2036, including the installation of 19,684 MW of renewable energy \ncapacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW coming from solar power. \n \n15.  Consistency with sector strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, \nwhich emphasizes investments in renewable energy and wider access to energy.6 The project \nwill contribute to ADB\u2019s target of doubling annual climate financing to $6 billion by 2020. \n \nD.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n17.  As ADB\u2019s second grid-parity solar project in Thailand, the project has inherent risks that \nare absent in utility-scale solar projects with FIT subsidies. ADB\u2019s active participation enhances \nlocal commercial banks\u2019 confidence to co-invest because ADB is seen as playing an important \nrole  in  the  early  stage  of  development  of  the  grid-parity  rooftop  solar  business  model  by \ncatalyzing investment and setting high standards for subsequent scale-up in Thailand. ADB\u2019s \ninnovative  financing  structure  of  \u2018single  loan,  multiple  projects\u2019  will  significantly  reduce \ntransaction costs, increase project viability, and enhance the scalability of the business model.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED ", "  5\n \n18.  Although Thailand has a relatively strong banking sector, local commercial banks are \nunable to provide the long tenors necessary for the innovative grid-parity solar business model. \nShorter tenors reduce feasibility and increase the operational leverage of projects, which may \nlead to undue financial distress. With high up-front capital costs and long-term revenue streams, \nrenewable energy projects require lower amortization profiles to enhance their financial viability. \nADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  fills  a  funding  gap  in  long-term  finance  that  will  ensure  that \ncommercial rooftop solar projects are financed in a sound and sustainable manner. \n \nC.  Risks \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n19.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project have been identified to be minimal; and effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential adverse impacts will be incorporated in the \nenvironment, health, and safety (EHS) plan of the borrower.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n20.  The  borrower  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection strategy, will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.8 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance \nwith such laws, and (ii) the measures taken to achieve compliance. Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n21.  The sponsors and the borrower were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best \ninternational practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of \nterrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
