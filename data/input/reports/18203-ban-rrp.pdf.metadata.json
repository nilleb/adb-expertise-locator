I submit to the Board of Directors, for their con-\nsideration and decision, the following Report and Recommendation\non a proposed supplementary loan from the Special Funds\nresources of the Bank in an amount in various currencies\nequivalent to $4.55 million applied for by the People's Republic\nof Bangladesh for the financing of cost overrn of the Bangladesh\nWest Zone Power Project. The loan would have a term of 40 years,\nincluding a grace period of 10 years, with a service charge of\n1 per cent per annum.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n2. On 17 October 1973 the Bank approved, under the\nSpecial Funds Supplementation Scheme, two loans in various\ncurrencies aggregating $10.45 million to the People's Republic\nof Bangladesh for financing the Bangladesh West Zone Power\nProject. One loan amounting to $9.25 million was from the\nSpecial Funds resources (Loan No. 141-BAN(SF)) and the other\nfor $1.20 million from the ordinary capital resources (Loan\nNo. 142-BAN). These loans were made to meet the foreign\nexchange cost of construction of a gas turbine power plant at\nBheramara in the West Zone having a total capacity of 40MW,\nspare parts required to overhaul the existing gas turbine\ngeneration plant at Khulna, sub-station and communication\nequipment, consulting services and training of staff. The\nBorrower is the People's Republic of Bangladesh and the Exe-\ncuting Agency, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB),\nunder the Ministry of Power, Flood Control and Water Resources.\nThe loan agreements were signed on 14 November 1973 at the\nloans became effective on 6 February 1974. With a view to\nimtroving the financial and organizational position of BPDB,\nthe Bank also approved, aside from the project-oriented con-\nsultant services, a provision for consultants on management,\naccounting and financial aspects under the Bank's technical\nassistance amounting to $250,000 (T/A No. 95).\n3. The opening of bids in June 1974 for the 40MW gas\nturbine power plant indicated a foreign exchange cost which\nexceeded the total amount of the Bank loans. Moreover, the\nforeign exchange cost of the spares and equipment provided for\nsome of the associated facilities in the West Zone is also\nexpected to increase due to their accelerated deterioration\nduring the last 18 months, and also due to general price", "2 -\nescalation. The total foreign exchange component of the Project\nis now estimated to have increased by $4.55 million to $15\nmillion. In view of the balance-of-payments difficulties and\nnon-availability of other alternative sources of financing, the\nGovernment sent a delegation to Manila in September 1974 to\nseek a supplementary loan for the Project from the Bank.\nFollowing this request a Peappraisal Mission visited Bangladesh\nin October 1974.\n4. Formal negotiations for the proposed supplementary\nloan were held in Dacc on 18 November 197/ with the authorized\nrepresentatives of the Government of the People's Republic of\nBangladesh and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).\nII. THE ECONOMY\n5. The Economic Report on Bangladesh (BAN:Ec-l) was\ncirculated to the Board in March 1973. Economic data have\nbeen updated following the visits of Bank staff to the country\nin July and September 1974. The Basic Data for Bangladesh\nare presented in Appendix 1.\n6. With a population of 75 million living in an area\nof only 141,000 sq. km., Bangladesh faces critical and complex\ndevelopment problems. The main characteristics of the economy\nare the extreme poverty of the people, a very high population\ndensity of more than 500 per sq. km. aggravated by an annual\npopulation growth rate of about 2.5 per cent, a high unemploy-\nment rate of about 25-30 per cent, a literacy rate below 20\nper cent, a low life expectancy rate, and low productivity\nin various economic sectors. Having a per capita income of\nabout $80 in 1973, the country is among the world's least\ndeveloped countries.\n7. Bangladesh is predominantly an agricultural country.\nAbout 90 per cent of the population is rural and about 80 per\ncent is engaged in agriculture with substantial underemployment.\nThe agricultural sector generates nearly 60 per cent of GDP,\nwith rice being the predominant crop. Raw jute plays a key\nrole in the economy of Bangladesh, both as the major input for\nthe country's main industry and as the primary commodityfor\nexport. Between FY1969/70 and FY1973/74 raw jute and manufac-\ntured jute products earned 75 per cent to 90 per cent of\nBangladesh's foreign exchange.", "-3-\n8. The industrial sector plays a complementary role\nto the predominantly agriculture-based economy of the country.\nThe industrial sector contributes an estimated 8 per cent to\nGDP, of which large-scale industries account for about 6 per\ncent and the remainder originates in small-scale and cottage\nindustries. About two-third of all industry is agriculture-\nbased; the jute and cotton textile industries account for\nabout 40 per cent of the total industrial value-added and\nemploy about 60 per cent of the total industrial labor force.\nOther agro-basec1 industrial products are tea and leather for\nexport markets and sugar and tobacco for domestic consumption.\nConstruction, power and housing contribute another 8 per cent\nto GDP. The share of trade, transport and cther organized\nservices is about 25 per cent.\n9. A proper assessment of the overall economic perform-\nance of Bangladesh is made difficult by the deficiencies of\nnaticnal accounts statistics. Estimated GDP at cistant factor\ncosts in 1973/74 shows an increase of about 12 per cent over\nthat of 1972/73. Increases in the output of the agricultural,\nindustrial and power sectors were 11 per cent, 20 per cent and\n33 per cent respectively. It should be noted, however, that\nthese growth rates were based on 1972/73 records which were\nsubstantially lower than those of 1969/70.\t Production in\ngeneral has not yet reached the 1969/70 level.\n10. Bangladesh has suffered from consecutive crop\nfailures since independence as a result of drought, floods and\ndifficulties in the procurement and distribution of agriculture\ninputs. Whereas rice production showed an increase from 99\nmillion tons in 1972/73 to 11.7 million tons in 1973/74, jute\nproduction declined from 6.5 million bales in 1972/73 to 6.0\nmillion bales in 1973/74. The most serious problem confront-\ning the Government has been the continuing shortage of food.\nGovernment stock of food grains have not improve satisfacto-\nrily. The shortfalls in local production, compared with\nrequirements, had to be met by imports which had partly been\nmade possible through foreign grants. In 1972/73, record\nlevels of food imports of about 2.8 million tons, compared\nwith 1.7 million tons in 1973/74, prevented a widely feared", "general famine. After the mid-l974 flood disaster, it is\nexpected that the 1974/75 import requirementof food will\nbe in order of 2.3-2.5 million tons.\n11. Whereas the 1972/73 performance of the industrial\nsector was not very satisfactory, in 1973/74, the total\nindustrial production is estimated to have risen 20 per cent\nover the 1972/73 level against a plan target of 30 per cent\nbut was still below the level attained in 1969/70. Production\nof jute textiles has shcwn some improvement but is likely not\nto exceed 90 per cent of the 1969/70 production. Some\nindustries, like newsprint, paper and rayor suffered severely\nfrom the oil crisis, but jute goods benefitted from it in the\nform of higher export prices. However 9 export price increases\nwere negligible, compared with the steep increase in prices of\nessential imports, especially food grains, oil and fertilizer.\n12. Bangladesh has still not recovered entirely from\nthe losses during the war in communications, roads and high-\nways, railways, power generating and other infrastrucutre\nfacilities. The revival of industrial activities would\ncontinue to be affected by the inadequate reconstruction of\nthe infrastructure facilities.\n13. Since independence, and especially during 1972/73\nand thereafter, prices of all commodities rose at a much\nfaster rate than previously. On average, the cost of living\nin Dacca, for which an index is available, increased in 1972/\n73 by 50 per cent; and by 40 per cent during 1973/74 according\nto the Government statistics.\n14. Besides imported inflation, which played a much more\nimportant role in stimulating price increases in 1973/74\nthan in 1972/73, this abnormal situation developed largely\nbecause of the low level of domestic production and internal\ndistribution deficiencies which left a large gap between the\navailability of goods and the demand. Imports could not bridge\nthe gap adequately. Money supply increased very rapidly in\n1972/73 by 43 per cent; but slowed down to 17 per cent in\n1973/74.\n15. In both 1972/73 and 1973/74 fiscal revenues could\ncover only about 80 per cent of current expenditures. Food\nsubsidies, amounting to Tk.783 million in 1972/73 and to\nTk.963 million in 1973/74, were the main cause for the", "5\nincrease in the current expenditures. To cover partially\nthe overall budgetary deficits of Tk.4,778 million in 1972/73\nand Tk.4,811 million in 1973/74, the Government had to\nresort to deficit financing to the extent of Tk.1,611 million\nin 1972/73 and Tk.1,771 million in 1973/74. In order to\nreduce the 1974/75 deficit, the Government took some measures,\nsuch as introduction of a new import license tax, increase\nof railway fares and postal rates, reduction of food subsidies\nand agricultural input subsidies. With these measures,\nrevenues are projected to rise by as much as 50 per cent over\nthe 1973/74 level. Despite this, the 1974/75 overall budgetary\ndeficit is estimated at Tk..4,564 million.\n16. To a considerable extent, the present severe difficul\nties in the balance payments are the result of unfavorable\nexternal factors. The deficit on current account in the\nbalance of payments, deteriorated to $561 million in 1973/74\ncompared with a deficit of $315 million in 1972/73. Besides\nlarge outlays of foreign exchange for food grains, and the\npoor export performance\t export volumes in 1973/74 were\nlower than in 1972/73\t the most important factor was the\nsharp deterioration in the terms of trade. Significant\nincreases in import prices occurred with respect to major\nimports such as food grains, edible oils, fertilizers, crude\noil, petroleum products, raw cotton and cotton yard, leading\nto an overall increase of import prices of about 65 per cent\nin 1973/74 coirpared with the previous year. On the other\nhand price improvements with respect to raw jute and jute\nmanufactures, the main export items, were less than 4 per cent\nfor the same period. In addition, there has been a shortfall\nin the disbursement of foreign aid. Instead of the expected\nTk.3,520 million, only Tk.3,000 million is estimated to\nhave been received from foreign sources in 1973/74, forcing\nthe Government to cut down expenditures under the Annual Plan\nby 14 per cent.\n17. The balance of payments outlook for 1974/75 is not\npromising. Total export of goods and services is estimated\nat $410 million but estimated imports of food grains alone\naccount for $506 million. The deficit on current account for\n1974/75 is $1,030 million. This deficit is planned to be\npartially financed by $50 million food aid, $160 million\ncommodity aid, $159 million project aid and the I.NF oil", "I.\nfacility of $45 million. The means for financing the remaining\n$650 million still has to be found. Foreign exchange reserves\nhave been falling sharply in recent months from about $137\nmillion at the end of December 1973 to $38 million at the end\nof August 1974, equivalent to about half of one month's\ncommercial import requirements, considering an estimated total\nimport volume of about $920 million in 1973/74. At the end\nof 1973 Bng1adesh's total outstanding public debt was $834\nmillion,1\" of which $355 million were loans from the Govern\nments and $258 million from international organizations. In view\nof the July/Septmber\t 1974 flood,\t the worst since 1954,\nthe low foreign exchange reserves and the Government's short-\nterm commitments, the economic situat:Lon especially during\nthe next few months, will be very difficult.\n18. The present economic situation, however, not only\nreflects the series of unfavorable external and domestic deve-\nlopments, but also deep-rooted problems in the structure of\nthe economy. To deal with these difficulties, the Government\nannounced in November 1973 the First FiveYear Plan (1973/74\nto l977/78) having a total outlay of Tk.44,550 million.\nDespite some revisions which will be necessary in the light\nof international and domestic developments, including the\nmid-1974 flood disaster, it is expected that the main prio-\nrities - 24 per cent of the outlays for agriculture and 20\nper cent for industry\t will be maintained. The program for\nthe agricultural sector aims to achieve self-sufficiency in\nfood grain production in the terminal year of the Plan,\nmainly through the application of a seedbase technology\nconsisting of high-yielding varieties of IRRI rice, fertilizers\nand irrigation projects. A delay of a few years in reaching\nthis goal is likely, however. The Government's new Investment\nPolicy, promulgated in July 19749 is directed mainly towards\nincreasing the private sector's participation in productive\ninvestments.\n19. The prevailing problems call for continuous and\nenergetic efforts by Government to improve economic adminis-\ntration and for increased foreign assistance. After the\n1/ Only loans contracted since independence and debt with\na maturity of over one year.", "Government circulated an Aide Memoire to potential donors,\noutlining its foreign exchange difficulties and appealing\nfor a substantial increase in immedtate financial assistance,\nn IBRD-sponsored Aid Group meeting was held in October\n1974. During the next few years, Bangladesh's needs for aid\nare estimated at about $1 billion a year. If the large\nunexploited natural gas resources can be tapped, and if the\nexploration for oil in the Bay of Bengal has favorable\nresults, the outlook of theeccinothy of Bangladesh would charie\nfor the better.\nIII. BANK OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH\n20. The Bank's operations in Bangladesh started in\nNovember 1972.1/ The Bank has so far extended seven loans\naggregating $33.05 million for four projects; three loans\namounting to $11.40 million from its ordinary capital\nresourcesa/ and four loans amounting to $21.65 million from\nits Special Funds resources. En addition, the Bank has\nextended six technical assistance grants totalling $698,000.\nFive of the technical assistance grants amounting to $652,000\nwere in connection with loan projects, principally for\nadvisory assistance to the institutions executing these\nprojects. The remaining technical assistance amounting to\n$46,000 was for the preparation of a jute seed project. The\nsank had also acted as the Executing Agency for the Bangladesh\nEnergy Survey Inception Study financed by UNDP at a cost of\n$50,000. Subsequently, the Bank has also agreed to act as\nan Executing Agency for the full-scale Energy Study to be\nfinanced by UNDP estimated to cost at $1.45 million.\n21. Appendix 2 shows the current status of the Bank's v\nprojects in Bangladesh. Two projects (Bangladesh Shilpa\nBank (BSB) and Chittagong Port) are on schedule, although\nutilization of the loan to BSE was somewhat slow in the initial\nstage. However, the other two projects (Fisheries Development\nand West Zone Power) are substantially delayed. Part A of\nthe Fisheries Development Project is undergoing modification\nin the scope of the Project. The West Zone Power Project is\ndelayed and involves an estimated cost overrun of $4.55\nmillion, for which a supplementary loan is being proposed.\n1/ The first mission namely, the EcOflomic-cum-Reconnaisance\nMission, visited Bangladesh from 28 November to 13 December\n1972. The country became a member of the Bank in March\n1973 and the first loan was extended in June 1973.\n2/ Including two loans under the Special Funds Supplementation\nScheme in 1973.", "-8-\nThe completion of the Project is expected by March 1976,\na delay of approximately 15 months.\t In connection with\nthe four loan projects, consultants under the Bank1s\ntechnical assistance have been provided to assist the\nexecuting agencies in management and financial aspects.\n22. At present, besides the proposed supplementary\nloan for the West Zone Power Project, four other projects\nare under active consideration by the Bank Ear possible\nloans. Of these projects,the Fertilizer Project is expected\nto meet, together with the production from existing plants,\nthe countrys entire need for fertilizer up to 1982/83. The\nhie Seed Project is envisaged to increase the product-\nivity of the cultivation of jute, the countrys major\nexport item. Similarly,theRailway Project is expected to\nimprove the efficiency of the transport system in the\ncountry. The Board papers for Bangladesh Shilpa Rin\nSangstha Project have already been circulated; the Project\nis expected to support the rehabilitation and modernization\nof the country's industrial sector and contribute to a\nhigher capacity utilization.\n23. Development of the agricultural sector through\nirrigation, area development, and fertilizer programs,\naiming mainly to increase the food supply, further improve-\nment and expansion of the transport sector and better\nutilization and amintenance of the existing power generating\nfacilities are expected to be the focus of the Bank'\noperations in 1975.\nIV. THE PROJECT\n24. A report entitled \"Reappraisal of the West Zone\nPower Project in Bang1adesh (Report No. BAN-Ap 3a) is\ncirculated herewith.\n25. The power system of Bangladesh suffered consiclera-\nble damage during the war of 1971. Although generation\nfacilities were not directly damaged, lack of spare parts,\nmaintenance and overhaul seriously affected their perform-\nance. Transmission and distribution facilities were\nseriously damaged. Power demand fell considerably and the", "peak demand dropped from 223MW to 30MW. A reconstrucdon\nprogram and temporary repairs for immediate restoration\nof the power supply enabled the return to pre-indepen-\ndence generation levels of 535MW; the total generation\ncapacity in the public sector presently stands at\naround 586MW. However, recurrent power failures created\nconsiderable losses in industrial production, which now\nconsumes about 70 per cent of total power used.\n26. The Government allocated Tk.4,235 million for\ndevelopment outlay of the power sector in the First Five-\nYear Plan; this constitutes 9.5 per cent of the total\ndevelopment outlay. In 1973/74, a total of Tk.428.9\nmillion (including a foreign exchange component of the\nequivalent of Tk.l82.7 million) accounting for 10.6 per\ncent of the total development outlay was planned.\nHowever, due to resource constraint, the provision had to\nbe reduced to Tk.359..8 (including foreign exchange compo-\nnent of the equivalent of Tk.150 million). In view of the\nfinancial constraints, the physical target anticipated\nin the Annual Development Plan could not be achieved.\nIn the 1974/75 Annual Development Plan, the power sector\nwas allocated Tk 630 million (with a foreign exchange\ncomponent equivalent to Tk.212 million) or about 12 per\ncent of the total development outlay of Tk.5,250 million.\nThis is the fourth largest sectoral allocation after\nflood control and water resources, transport (each with\n15.2 per cent) and industries (13.5 per cent). The main\nemphasis is placed on the completion of ongoing projects,\nwhich include the West Zone Power Project.\n27. The purpose of the Project is to help the West\nZone system meet the projected load growth and to permit\na more orderly and efficient use of other generation\nfacilities by supplying peaking and stand-by capacity,\nand to supply industries in the West Zone with reliable\nand adequate energy.", "28. The schedule of Project implementation envisaged\nat the time of appraisal in May 1973 was based on the tender\ndocuments for the turnkey contract for the gas turbine power\nplant which were prepared in 1969 and was prepared assuming\nthat they required only limited modification to specifications\nand other items. It was therefore expected that these tender\ndocuments, and also the invitation letter to prospective\nconsultants, could be finalized and issued by September\n1973, and the contracts with the consultants and the supplier\nsigned by December 1973. However, on account of BPDB's in-\nadequate experience in undertaking work of this nature and\nits unfamiliarity with Bank procedures, issuance of these\ndocuments was considerably delayed. The contract for con-\nsultant services and that with the lowest evaluated bidder\nwere signed in November 1974.\n29. Following the receipt and evaluation of bids for\nthe 40MW gas turbine power plant, it was found that the\nforeign exchange funds available under the Bank loans were\ninsufficient to finance the full foreign exchange cost of\nthe Project. Similarly, the accelerated deterioration of\nassociated facilities in operation during the last 18 months\ntogether with the price escalation is expected to increase\nthe foreign exchange cost of spare parts and equipment.\n30. In order that a contract for the gas turbine\nstation could be negotiated and finalized with the lowest\nevaluated bidder before the expiry of bid validity on 30\nSeptember 1974, the Government sought the Banks approval to ne-\ngotiate and award the contract even though the bid value\nexceeded the amount of the Bank loans. Subsequent to the\nGovernment?\ns request, a delegation consisting of represen-\ntatives of the Government and BPDB officials together with\nthe Project consultant visited the Bank from 18 to 25\nSeptember 1974 and held discussions with Bank staff. Based\non these discussions and Bank staffts recommendations, the\nBank concurred with the above request to negotiate and\nfinalize a contract with the lowest evaluated bidder on the\nunderstanding that such concurrence would not in any manner\nincrease the Bank? s commitment beyond what it had already under-\ntaken under the loans sanctioned earlier. It was also\ndecided that the Project should be reappraised, and if\nfound satisfactory, a supplementary loan would be recommended\nto the Board for consideration (see Board Information\nPaper IN:95-74 dated 11 November 1974).", "- 11 -\n31.\t A reappraisal of the Project in 0.ctober 1974\nindicated that $4.55 million would be needed to meet the\noverrun in the foreign exchange cost. The main component\nof the cost overrun is the increase in the cost of the\n4OM1 gas turbine plant which accounts for $4.00 million.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated to have increased\nfrom $17.5 million to $25 million, of which $15 million is\nthe foreign exchange component, as against $10.45 million\noriginally estimated.\n32.\t The benefit accruing from the Project remains\nunchanged, and the simple cycle gas turbine generators pro-\nvided under the Project continue to be the least cost source\nof power for the West Zone in the present circumstances.\nTaking into account the changes in the capital and,operating\ncosts, projected load growth and tariff revision,1 the\neconomic rate of return of the Project is estimated at 5\nper cent compared with 12 per cent at the time of appraisal\nof the Project in May 1973. However, with a further moderate\nincrease in tariff of about 10 per cent,the rate of return\nwould improve to about 12 per cent. It is expected that\ntariff revision of a greater magnitude than 10 per cent\ncould be introduced in the light of the finding of  the Bank\nconsultants in the near future.\n33.\t Although certain management and operating problems\npointed out by the Bank's Appraisal Mission in May 1973 still\nexist, the Government and BPDB have undertaken important steps\naimed at streamlining the management and organization of BPDB.\nThe four-member Board of BPDB has been made fully functional\nand a full-time Chairman has been appointed - who is also the\nChief Executive of BPDB. With a view to delegating authority,\nBPDB proposes to reorganize regional offices. These measures\nare regarded as interim by the Government and it has assured\nthe Reappraisal Mission that, when the management expert\nunder the Bank's technical assistance is appointed, further\nmodification and improvement would be considered in the light\nof the recommendation made by him.\n1/ The tariff rate referred to includes the 100 per cent\nincrease which has been approved by the Government\nand to be implemented on 1 December 1974.", "- 12 -\n34. The Bank stresses the importance of maintenance\nrequirements -- this being the most neglected area of BPDB's\noperation - - and BPDB is required under the loan provisions\nto formulate a comprehensive maintenance program for the\nWest Zone facilities by June 1975. After this program is\nformulated, the Covnment and BPDB will consider suitable\naction in consultation with the Bank and other related\nagencies regarding possible finance for implementation of\nthe program.\n35. The financial position of BPDB has not improved\nin the past 12 months. The increase in fuel prices has\naggravated the situation. In order to improve the financial\nposition of BPDB, the Government has agreed to take the\nfollowing measures: (i) tariff increase, (ii) reduction of\nthe level of accounts receivable and (iii) conversion of\nlong-term debt from the Government into equity by BPDB. As\nan interim measure, the Bank was assured by the Government\nthat a 100 per cent tariff increa3e will become effective\non 1 December 1974 and accounts receivable will be reduced\nto a level of about four months sales by the end of 1975.\nThe Government and BPDB further assured that they would take\nmeasures to improve the financial position of BPDB, in\nconsultation with the Bank, when the recommendations of the\nBank-financed consultants are available.\n36. The Project remains technically feasible and des-\npite the increase in cost, economically justified and suitable\nfor Bank financing. In view of the critical economic situa-\ntion and difficult balance of payment position, the proposed\nloan in the amount of $4.55 million is recommended from the\nBank rs Special Funds resources,\n37. The proceeds of the Bank loan are intended to be\nmade available to BPDB by the Government at an interest rate\nof 7,5 per cent, to be repaid over the 25 years. The terms\nof the relending arrangements will be subject to review by\nthe Bank and the Government at the time of the overall\nfinancial review, following the completion of the work of\nthe Financial and Accounting consultants.", "- 13 -\nIV.
