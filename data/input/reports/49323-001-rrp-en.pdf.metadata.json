Agriculture  has  developed  rapidly  and \n2. \ncontributed substantially to the PRC's overall economic development. However, the transition to \nmodern  agriculture  has  not  kept  pace  with  urbanization  and  industrialization  in  the  country.  In \n2014,  the  per  capita  income  of  urban  households  was  2.75  times  that  of  rural  households.2 \nGiven  its  fundamental  contribution  to  food  security  and  improved  rural  livelihoods,  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  continues  to  prioritize  highly  the  modernization  of  agriculture, \nparticularly by encouraging stronger participation of private companies. \n \n3. \nIncreasing  demand  for  animal  proteins. The PRC is the world\u2019s largest consumer of \nmeat, with annual spending reaching $300 billion. Of all animal protein consumed in the PRC, \npork  represents  50%  and  chicken  19%.  Increasing  demand  for  meat  is  driven  by  the  rising \nmiddle  class  and  changing  diets  associated  with  urbanization.  The  per  capita  consumption  of \nchicken in the PRC (10 kilograms in 2015) is still only one third of that in Taipei, China, while the \nper capita consumption of pork (44 kilograms in 2015) is 35% less than in Hong Kong, China. \nThis indicates that the market will continue to grow significantly. \n \n4. \nAnimal disease and food safety issues. The growth of the livestock and meat industry \nhas  been  associated  with  serious  animal  disease and food  safety  issues,  as  demonstrated  by \nthe repeated avian influenza outbreaks,3 the Huangpu River dead pig incident,4 and various fast \nfood poultry meat scandals5 during 2004\u20132015. The government has made significant progress \nin  animal  disease  prevention  and  food  safety  management,  but  ultimate  responsibility  for \nimplementing these measures remains with farmers and food producers. \n \nEnvironmental  concerns.  If  not  properly  managed,  the  development  of  the  livestock \n5. \nindustry could harm the environment. Livestock farms produce waste with a high concentration \nof pollutants that is often discharged without proper treatment, polluting land and waterways and \ncausing  significant  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Although  the  government  promotes  policies \nmandating waste treatment, most farms still lack proper waste treatment facilities.6 \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2016.

Manila. \n\n3  In 2004, 2006, and 2013. \n4  In March 2013, 16,000 dead pigs were found in the Huangpu River, which supplies Shanghai with drinking water. \n5  For example in December 2012, KFC was criticized for excessive antibiotic use by its poultry suppliers in the PRC. \n6  ADB.2015.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nLivestock  farming  consolidation.  To meet  the  growing  demand for  quality  meat,  the \n6. \ngovernment  is  supporting  the  development  of  modern  and  standardized  livestock  farms. 7 \nLivestock  production  in  the  PRC  remains  highly  fragmented.  Large  pig  farms  (those  that \nproduce  more  than  500  pigs  per  year)  represent  only  35%  of  production;  in  contrast,  in  the \nUnited States large farms represent 84% of production.8 The involvement of medium- to large-\nscale  private  companies is  necessary  to facilitate  the required  investments  and  introduce  best \npractices  in  livestock  farming  in  terms  of  animal  disease  prevention,  food  safety,  and  animal \nwaste  management.  In  addition,  private  companies  are  able  to  work  in  partnership  with \nsmallholder  farmers  and  help  reduce  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap  (another  government \nobjective),  while  retaining  control  of  the  critical  steps  of  the  production  process  to  ensure  the \nquality and safety of the final products. \n \nBorrower\u2019s selection. Lihua is the second largest yellow chicken9 company in the PRC. \n7. \nIt  is  also  involved  in  pig  and  goose  farming.  The  project  team  identified  Lihua  as  suitable  for \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  because  of  its  (i)  uniquely  inclusive  contract  farming \nmodel, which offers smallholder farmers quality inputs, financial and technical assistance (TA), \nand guaranteed income; (ii) strong track record in poultry farming (since 1997) and pig farming \n(since 2011); and (iii) highly experienced management team led by Chairman Cheng Lili. Lihua \nis committed to adopting international best practices, including ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, \nand to setting a benchmark for the livestock industry in the PRC.10 \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n8. \nThe  project  will  promote  a  livestock  farming  business  model  that  includes  smallholder \nfarmers  in  a  sustainable  production  process.  ADB  will  support  Lihua\u2019s  $183 million  investment \nplan  during  2017\u20132019,  including  (i)  breeder  farm  expansion,  (ii)  contract  farming  expansion, \n(iii) environmental capital expenditure, and (iv) animal health and food safety capital expenditure. \n \nBreeder  farm  expansion.  Lihua\u2019s  breeder  farms  are  dedicated  to  the  in-house \n9. \nproduction  of  chicks  and  piglets,  which  are  then  provided  to  contract  farmers  for  rearing  into \ncommercial chickens and pigs. Chicks are produced by breeder or parent chickens. The parent \nchickens  for  the  new  breeder  farms  will  be  provided  by  the  company\u2019s  existing  grandparent \nchicken farm in Jiangsu (Lihua has developed its own varieties of yellow chickens). Piglets are \nproduced  by  breeder  sows  and  boars,  which  will  be  procured  externally  for  the  new  breeder \nfarms from reputable international pig breeding stock companies such as the Pig Improvement \nCompany. \n \n10. \nContract farming expansion. The project will help Lihua develop new contract farming \narrangements  with  1,000  chicken  farmers  and  100  pig  farmers  (1,100  additional  farm \nhouseholds). Lihua has already been working with 4,400 chicken farmers and 100 pig farmers. \nLihua  provides  contract  farmers  with  (i)  quality  inputs  (chicks,  piglets,  feed,  and  veterinary \nproducts); and (ii) real-time TA (provided by 160 extension services agents employed by Lihua \nand  trained  in  veterinary  science),  especially  relating  to  disease  control  and  prevention  to \nensure the quality and safety of the final products. While chicken farmers have to invest in their \nown farms (supported by grants and subsidized loans provided by Lihua), pig contract farmers \n\n                                                \n7  Central  Committee  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China  and  Government  of  the  PRC.  2015.  Resolutions  on \n\nAccelerating Agricultural Modernization by Enhancing Revolution and Innovation. Beijing. \n\n8  Guangdong Wen's Foodstuffs Group Company. 2013. Prospectus of the First Medium Term Note 2013. Beijing. \n9  Yellow-feather  or  yellow  chicken  is  a  breed  of  chicken  traditionally  raised  for  meat  in  the  PRC,  distinct  from  the \n\nmore common white-feather or white chicken (broiler). \n\n10 The term \u201clivestock\u201d is used to refer to all domesticated animals raised on farms, including poultry. \n\n\f3 \n\nare provided space within the company\u2019s pig farm clusters (each cluster includes both a breeder \nfarm and farm space for around 50 contract farmers). Finally, to address farmers\u2019 vulnerability to \nnatural  hazards  and  animal  disease outbreaks,  Lihua  sets  aside  funds  to  create  an  insurance \npool that can cover up to 95% of the cost of dead animals. \n \n11. \nLihua\u2019s  unique  contract  farming  model  provides  an  attractive  and  stable  source  of \nincome for participating farmers. Lihua aims to set the annual farmer\u2019s income at a minimum of \n50%  more  than  the  average  urban  worker\u2019s  salary  in  the  region. 11 This  means  that  Lihua \nguarantees an annual income of at least CNY100,000 per household, or around CNY24,400 per \ncapita, 26% more than the PRC\u2019s median per capita income of CNY19,281 in 2015.12 However, \nsince  Lihua  targets  households  in  rural  low-income  segments,  households  typically  more  than \ndouble their income after joining Lihua\u2019s contract farming scheme. Previous occupations include \nfarming,  factory  work,  construction  work,  and  transportation  services.  According  to  ADB\u2019s  due \ndiligence,  by  leaving  their  previous  occupations  and  partnering  with  Lihua,  farmers  obtain \nseveral benefits, including (i) a stable income, (ii) reduced and more flexible working hours, and \n(iii) the ability to live closer to their hometown to look after children and aging parents.13 \n \n12. \nEnvironmental  capital  expenditure.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  soil  and  water  pollution \nassociated with large-scale livestock farms, the project will include investments in animal waste \ncollection, storage, and treatment. Chicken manure will be collected by conveyor belts under the \nchicken houses and pig manure will be collected by scraping solid floors, without using water for \nwashing. The manure will be sold to third party farmers living around Lihua\u2019s corporate farms for \nuse  as  organic  fertilizer.  Wastewater  generated  by  pigs  requires  specific  treatment  in  on-site \nwastewater  treatment  stations.  The  treated  wastewater  will  be  used  to  irrigate  nearby  farms. \nThe  proposed  capital  expenditure  will  help  Lihua  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) requirements. \n \n13. \nAnimal health and food safety capital expenditure. High-quality feed is a key element \ncontributing  to  animal  health  and  food  safety.  High-quality  livestock  feed  improves  animal \nhealth, reduces the risk of  disease and  use  of medicine  (especially  antibiotics),  and increases \nthe  quality  of  the  finished  products.  The  company  will  build  its  own  feed processing  plants  on \nthe  same  sites  as  the  company\u2019s  chicken  and  pig  breeding  farms.  As  part  of  the  project,  the \ncompany will make other investments to ensure animal health and food safety (e.g., veterinary \nequipment,  testing  facilities,  temperature  and  humidity  control  systems,  and  information \nsystems). \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\n14. \nLihua  is  headquartered  in  Changzhou,  Jiangsu.  The  company\u2019s  existing  poultry  farms \nare  located  in the  provinces  of  Anhui,  Guangdong,  Henan,  Jiangsu,  Shandong,  and  Zhejiang. \nThe  company\u2019s  pig  farms  are  located  in  Jiangsu.  As  of  2015,  Lihua\u2019s  annual  production  was \naround 193 million yellow chickens and 192,500 pigs. Lihua was founded in 1997 by Cheng Lili, \nan  animal  health  graduate  and  young  entrepreneur  at  the  time.  In  1999,  Lihua  successfully \ndeveloped a new yellow chicken breed named \u201cSnow Mountain\u201d, and its yellow chicken farming \nbusiness started to grow quickly. In 2000, the company adopted the contract farming business \n\n                                                \n11 Lihua is able to achieve this by helping farmers invest in productive assets (chicken farms, chicks, and piglets) and \n\nby boosting farmers\u2019 productivity through high quality inputs and the TA provided. \n\n12 National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2016.

Beijing. \n\n \n\n\fmodel  to  accelerate  its  expansion.  In  2011,  Lihua  began  farming  pigs  as  a  diversification \nstrategy. In less than 20 years, Lihua has become one of the largest livestock companies in the \nPRC, with 3,000 employees as of 2015. \n \nAs of 2015, 91.4% of Lihua\u2019s revenue came from its chicken business, while 7.4% came \n15. \nfrom  the  pig  business  and  1.2%  from  the  goose  business.  Lihua  plans  to  ramp  up  its  pig \nbusiness to further diversify its product base. At the same time, Lihua will continue to invest in \npoultry to safeguard its position in the market. In 2015, Lihua captured 5.2% of the PRC yellow-\nchicken market and 0.1% of the pig market. However, competitive pressure is limited since the \nchicken and pig sectors are both highly fragmented. \n \n16. \nLihua  is  a  privately  held  company.  Cheng  Lili  owns  a  26.0%  direct  shareholding  in  the \ncompany,  but  controls  59.7%  of the  company\u2019s  shares through  his  majority  ownership in  local \nprivate equity funds, which hold 33.7% of the company\u2019s shares. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n14\n\n17. \nImpacts.  The  project  will  set  a  benchmark  in  terms  of  smallholder  farmer  inclusion, \nenvironmental sustainability, animal health, and food safety practices for the livestock industry in \nthe  PRC.  The  project  is  fully  consistent  with  the  strategic  orientations  for  agricultural \nmodernization  and  rural  development  provided  by  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Communist \nParty  of  China  and  the  State  Council  in  its  Document  No.  1  in  January  2016,\n particularly  its \ncalls  to  (i)  coordinate  agricultural  industry  chains  and  farmer  interests  more  closely,  (ii) \nstrengthen  the  governance  of  major  agricultural  environment  problems,  and  (iii)  implement  a \nfood safety strategy. \n \n18. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  a  demonstrated  inclusive  and  sustainable  livestock \nfarming business model. The number of contract farmers will increase from 4,500 in 2015 to at \nleast  5,600  in  2020.  New  contract  farming  households  will  increase  their  annual  income  from \nCNY50,000\u2013CNY70,000  on  average  (before  joining  Lihua\u2019s  program)  to  CNY100,000\u2013\nCNY140,000.15 The project will also support job creation and preservation in rural areas. Lihua\u2019s \nworkforce is expected to increase from 3,000 (39% women)  in 2015 to more than 4,500 (41% \nwomen) in 2020.16 Several of Lihua\u2019s existing and new farms are located in rural areas of some \nof  the  PRC\u2019s  poorer  provinces  such  as  Anhui  (25th  out  of  31  provinces  in  terms  of  gross \ndomestic  product  per  capita),  and  Henan  (22/31).  Indicators  as  to  waste  treatment,  animal \nhealth, and food safety are included in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n19. \nOutputs.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  constructed  breeder  farms,  (ii)  expanded  contract \nfarming,  (iii)  environmental  capital  expenditure,  and  (iv)  animal  health  and  food  safety  capital \nexpenditure.17 \n \n\n                                                \n14 Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. 2016.

Income  and  asset  holding  of  new  contract  farmers  before  and  after  the  project,  and \nother potential project benefits, will be analyzed. \n\n16 The targeted increase in the proportion of women reflects Lihua\u2019s plans to hire and retain more women workers. \n17 Output indicators are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n20. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  emphasizes  the  need  to  contribute  to  food \nsecurity  and  agricultural  productivity,  promote  food  safety  and  quality  standards,  and  support \ninclusive  businesses  such  as  agribusinesses  that  connect  farmers  to  food  markets. 18  The \nproject is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC. To \nsupport  rural  development  for  inclusive  economic  growth,  ADB  will  help  the  PRC  develop \nsuitable methods to (i) modernize agriculture, (ii) promote circular agriculture, and (iii) improve \nfood safety. Through its private operations, ADB will support agribusiness projects that enhance \nproductivity, the inclusion of smallholder farmers in value chains, and food safety (footnote 2). \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  fully \n21. \naligns with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, which  stresses that \nADB\u2019s  private  agribusiness  investments  \u201chave  the  potential  to  benefit  millions  of  smallholder \nfarmers directly and contribute to public goods, such as food security, food safety, and reduced \nsoil and water pollution\u201d.19 The project builds on lessons from ADB\u2019s long history in the PRC\u2019s \nlivestock  sector,  particularly  the  need  to  achieve  development  impact  through  private  agro-\nenterprises with sufficient scale and direct linkages with farmers.20 The project will complement \na  PRC  sovereign  project  approved  in  2015,  which  will  provide  similar  assistance  to  livestock \ncompanies in Henan (footnote 6). \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nLihua is subject to the general laws regulating private enterprises in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina as they relate to large-scale livestock farming. In particular, Lihua is subject to (i) the \nAnimal Husbandry Law (2005); (ii) the Environmental Protection Law (2015); (iii) the Animal \nEpidemic Prevention Law (2007, amended in 2015); and (iv) the Food Safety Law (2009, \namended in 2015). \nLihua is led by a management team with long experience in the livestock industry. Cheng Lili, \nLihua\u2019s chairperson, is an animal nutrition graduate with more than 30 years of experience in the \nlivestock industry. His management skills are a key factor driving Lihua\u2019s success. \nIt takes around 12 months to construct a feed mill, up to 24 months to set up a breeder chicken \nfarm or pig farm cluster, and up 36 months to set up a breeder pig farm. \nEquipment and civil works will be procured in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time) as they apply to private projects. ADB\u2019s technical consultant has \nreviewed the project costs (based on a sample of feasibility studies provided by the company), \nand found them to be in line with market standards. \nLihua provides the chicks and piglets born on its breeding farms to contract farmers for rearing. \nThe company provides contract farmers with financial and technical assistance, and buys back \n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 2014.

ADB will fund the A loan from its ordinary capital resources, \nand the complementary loan will be funded by commercial banks, with ADB acting as the lender \nof  record.  Lihua  will  use  the  loan  proceeds  to  finance  those  of  its  subsidiaries  that  will  be \nimplementing different components of the project. The terms and conditions for the A loan have \nbeen agreed upon with Lihua. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n25. \n\nADB assistance will add value on two fronts: \n(i) \n\nDemonstration  effect.  ADB  will  help  Lihua  set  a  benchmark  in  terms  of  small \nholder  farmer  inclusion  and  sustainability  in  the  PRC\u2019s  livestock  industry.  ADB \nwill  enhance  Lihua\u2019s  standards  through  (a)  the  application  of  international \nsafeguard standards, and (b) the welfare impact analysis that will be conducted \nduring project implementation. ADB will increase the visibility of Lihua\u2019s business \nmodel, enabling other large- and medium-scale companies to learn from it. \nLong-term  finance  mobilization.  So  far,  the  company  has  financed  its \nexpansion  through  equity  and  short-term  loans.  However,  the  investments \nincluded  in  the  project  have  payback  periods  of  5\u201310  years.  ADB  will  provide \nLihua with the required long-term financing and, through the complementary loan, \nencourage commercial banks to provide such long-term financing as well. \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n21 The project is an inclusive business assistance because (i) it provides income opportunities to low-income people \n(the  per  capita  income  of  contract  farmers  before  working  with  Lihua  is  CNY10,000\u2013CNY17,000  (lower  than  the \nPRC\u2019s  median  per capita income  of  CNY19,281  in 2015);  (ii)  it  will,  on  average, more  than  double  their  income; \nand (iii) it includes innovative features (e.g., extension services and insurance), increasing farmers\u2019 resilience. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n[Redacted] \n \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n26. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples.  Since  the  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  a  corporate  loan  that  will  finance  general \nbusiness  expansion  and  is  not  earmarked  for  financing  specific  subprojects,  the  requirements \nfor  general  corporate  finance  projects  will  apply.  The  project\u2019s  potential  environmental  and \nsocial  impacts  have  been  identified,  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate  for  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.22 The \nlivestock  farms  will  be  sited  in  coordination  with  the  local  government  to  ensure  that  they \nconform to  local  land use plans  and  avoid legally  protected  areas.  Potential  risks  and impacts \nduring construction are mostly site-specific and short-term, and can be effectively managed by \ngood engineering construction and housekeeping practices implemented through a construction \nenvironmental  management  plan.  During  operation,  the  new  animal  waste  treatment  facilities \nwill mitigate concerns as to solid waste, including animal manure and wastewater treatment and \ndisposal, which have the potential to pollute soil, and surface and groundwater. Since the farms \nwill be located away from inhabited areas, nuisance, noise, and odor impacts will be mitigated. \nThe audit noted that the livestock farms visited fully comply with applicable regulations from the \nAnimal Epidemic Prevention Law of the PRC.23 \n \n27. \nLihua  will  either  lease  unused  or  abandoned  lands  on  a  willing  lessor\u2013willing  lessee \nbasis,  or  procure  state-owned  land  from  the  local  government.  In  case  of  unavoidable \ndisplacement,  such  as  relocation  related  to  a  sanitation  buffer  zone  set  by  local  regulations, \nLihua will discuss and coordinate measures with the government to address any identified gaps. \nAny of Lihua\u2019s investment transactions entailing significant involuntary resettlement impacts will \nbe  excluded  from  ADB  financing.  As  the  farms  are  expected  to  be  developed  in  non-ethnic \nminority-concentrated provinces, impacts on indigenous peoples are unlikely. \n \n28. \nLihua engaged a qualified and experienced external expert to conduct a corporate audit \nof  the  company\u2019s  existing  environmental  and  social  policy,  procedures,  and  operations.  The \naudit  recommended  corrective  action  to  ensure  that  procedures  and  operations  are  adequate \nand  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  other  social  requirements.  Lihua  will \nadopt  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  satisfactory  to  ADB  before  the  first \nADB disbursement. Lihua will also enhance its institutional capacity, establish environment and \nsocial  units  at  both  corporate  and  farm  levels,  and  train  staff  on  the  environmental  and social \nmanagement system. \n \n29. \nLihua  and  its  contractors  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards. 24  Lihua  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  and  its \n\n                                                \n22 Farms  visited  during  the  audit  prepared  the  necessary  safeguard  reports  and  plans  (environmental  impact \n\nassessment registration forms), and approvals were obtained prior to operations. \n\n23 Farms  visited  during  the  audit  have  obtained  Certificates  for  Meeting  Animal  Epidemic  Prevention  Conditions \n\ndemonstrating compliance with the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law. \n\n24 ADB. 2003.

Lihua  will  increase  the  percentage  of  its  female  staff  from \n39% in 2015 to 41% in 2020, and will prioritize women applicants in the areas of finance, human \nresources,  and  laboratory  work.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nLihua was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \n30. \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n31. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \n32. \nCharter), 25  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \ngovernment has no objection to the proposed assistance to  Lihua. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \n33. \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$95,000,000  equivalent  in  yuan,  comprising  (i)  an  A  loan  of  up  to  $62,500,000  equivalent  in \nyuan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $32,500,000 \nequivalent in yuan to the Jiangsu Lihua Animal Husbandry Stock Company for the Inclusive and \nSustainable Livestock Farming Project in the  People\u2019s Republic of China, with such terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n17 November 2016 \n\n                                                \n25 ADB. 1966.
