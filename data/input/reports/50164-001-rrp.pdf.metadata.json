Restoring the health of river and lake ecosystems and improving \nresilience  to  water-related  disasters  are  increasingly  important  priorities  of  the  Government  of \nthe  PRC.  According  to  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  28%  of  the  available  surface \nwater of the country\u2019s seven major rivers and 31% of the water of key lakes and reservoirs are \nunfit  for  human  consumption. 1  Once  polluted  to  this  degree,  traditional  pollution  mitigation \nmeasures, such as standalone wastewater treatment facilities, are usually insufficient to recover \nthe water ecosystem. \n \n3. \nto  develop  water \ninfrastructure,  enforce  strict  pollution  controls,  and  rehabilitate  degraded  water  resources.2 To \nsupport  these  efforts,  the  government  is  also  encouraging  new  forms  of  public\u2013private \npartnership  (PPP)  to  promote  waterbody  pollution  control  and  rehabilitation. 3  Through  an \nintegrated,  coordinated  approach  to  planning,  an  increasing  number  of  local  governments  are \nengaging  private  operators  to  mitigate  pollution  and  restore  the  health  of  river  and  lake \necosystems  through  multiple,  interlocking  subprojects  tendered  under  a  single  basin-wide \nconcession.  Openness  to  this  comprehensive  approach,  involving  wider  participation  of  the \nprivate  sector,  reflects  a  growing  expectation  that  PPP  will  enhance  operational  efficiency, \nfinancing  capacity,  and  technical  expertise,  and  thereby  address  the  country\u2019s  water  pollution \nissues more effectively. \n \n4. \nThrough discussion with stakeholders in the PRC\u2019s water and sanitation sectors and the \nongoing screening of project opportunities, the project team identified China Water Environment \nGroup (CWE), a leading integrated water infrastructure provider, as having specialized expertise \nin  river  and  lake  restoration  projects.  CWE  acknowledged  the  strong  experience  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  water  sector  operations,  and  asked \nADB to lead the arrangement of a dual currency financing package. \n \nProject  design.  The  project  is  designed  to  support  the  implementation  of  integrated \n5. \nwastewater  management  concessions  targeting  environmental  services  for  rivers  and  lakes. \nThe ADB loan would support CWE in designing, constructing, and operating a series of facilities \nspanning  several  components,  including  (i)  wastewater  treatment  plants;  (ii)  sludge  treatment \nplants;  (iii)  sewage  conveyance  and  interception  pipelines;  (iv)  other  civil  works,  such  as  the \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2015.

For  each  subproject,  CWE  will \ndevelop  and  operate  the  component  facilities  as  PPPs  to  be  governed  under  concession \nagreements  signed  with  city  or  county  governments.  The  agreements  will  (i)  state  CWE\u2019s \nresponsibilities  for  construction  and  operation,  (ii)  convey  rights  of  service  exclusivity,  (iii) \nidentify  performance  standards  and  other  output  requirements,  and  (iv)  set  forth  payment \nmechanisms. The subprojects will be located in the central and western provinces of the PRC.4 \n \n7. \nThe  sponsor  and  borrowers.  CWE  is  the  project\u2019s  sponsor  and  guarantor.  With  a \ntreatment  capacity  of  1.8  million  tons  per  day  in  2015,  CWE  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  50  largest \nwastewater  treatment  companies  by  operating  scale. 5  The  company  is  the  PRC\u2019s  most \nexperienced  player  in  integrated  river  and  lake  pollution  control  projects,  and  features \nprominently in national PPP initiatives. In 2014, CWE successfully implemented two greenfield \nnational PPP demonstration projects out of the Ministry of Finance\u2019s first batch of eight, and is \ncurrently developing four projects from the second batch.6  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n8. \nTwo wholly owned subsidiaries of CWE will serve as ADB\u2019s borrowers: (i) CWEI will be \nthe borrower for the US dollar and offshore yuan tranches, and (ii) XWE will be the borrower for \nthe onshore yuan tranche. Both companies are investment holding companies of CWE, and do \nnot have managerial or financial autonomy. CWE will guarantee the ADB loans. \n \n9. \nsignificant integrity issues were discovered. \n \nB. \n\nThe  requisite  integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  during  project  preparation,  and  no \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nOutcome.

The  impact  will  be  mitigated  water  pollution  in  rivers  and  lakes  in  the  PRC, \n\n10. \nconsistent with the goals of the PRC\u2019s State Council (footnote 3). \n \n11. \nservices under integrated concessions in selected central and western provinces of the PRC. \n \n12.   Output.  The  output  will  be  the  construction  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  and \nassociated civil works for the improvement of river and lake water quality. By 2024, river or lake \nrehabilitation  subprojects  will  be  developed  with  the  capacity  to  treat  2.3  million  tons  of \n                                                 \n4  The designation of \u201ccentral\u201d and \u201cwestern\u201d here includes the provinces and provincial areas of Chongqing, Gansu, \n\nGuangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan. \n\n5  Global Water Intelligence. 2015. China Shakes up Private Water Power List. July. \n6  One example of a PPP undertaken by CWE is the Erhai Lake Public\u2013Private Partnership Project in Dali, Yunnan, \nwhere  CWE  is  in  charge  of  designing,  building  and  operating  an  interception  sewer  pipeline  network,  water \npumping  stations,  wastewater  treatment  plants,  upstream  reservoirs,  and  artificial  wetlands  to  supply  water  for \nfarming  and  irrigation.  Another  such  example  is  the  Nanming  River  Rehabilitation  Project  in  Guiyang,  Guizhou \nProvince, the first phase of which involved wastewater and sludge facilities, river dredging, sewage pipelines, and \nriverway  development.  The  project  benefitted  from  strategic  work  undertaken  by  ADB\u2019s  East  Asia  Department \nunder  technical  assistance  to  the  Guiyang  Municipal  Government  to  develop  a  strategy  for  integrated  water \nresource management.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nwastewater  and  2,900  tons  of  sludge  per  day,  as  well  as  190  kilometers  of  sewage  pipeline \nnetworks  and  other  infrastructure.  The  facilities  will  comply  with  ADB  safeguard  requirements \nand technical and financial eligibility criteria.7 \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n13. \nConsistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020,  which  identifies  infrastructure  and  the  environment  as  two  of  ADB\u2019s  four \nstrategic priorities.8 With regard to infrastructure, the project is aligned with the strategy\u2019s focus \non water, sanitation, and waste management, as well as its emphasis on PPP. With regard to \nthe  environment,  the  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health  threats  and  promotes \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  the  country  strategy.  By  supporting  a  new  form  of  PPP, \nenvironment  management,  and  inclusive  growth,  the  project  addresses  three  of  the  five \nstrategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC: managing climate change \nand  the  environment,  supporting  inclusive  economic  growth,  and  supporting  institutional  and \ngovernance  reform. 9  In  particular,  the  project  aligns  with  this  strategy\u2019s  sector  focus  on \nenvironmental  protection,  and  strongly  complements  ADB\u2019s  initiatives  in  the  management  of \nwater-based  natural  resources,  including  flood  management,  wetland  conservation,  water \nresources development, and the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems.10 \n \n15. \nConsistency  with  the  water  sector  strategy.  The  project  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  water \npolicy aims to reverse the degradation of water resources caused by agricultural, industrial, and \nmunicipal  effluents. 11 ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  also  identifies  wastewater \nmanagement as a key operational focus in rapidly industrializing countries like the PRC.12 The \nproject is an example of the type of intervention envisaged by the plan, which promotes water \nas a core investment area and raises ADB\u2019s water investment target to $2.0 billion\u2013$2.5 billion \neach year by 2020, with an additional $500 million per year targeted in private sector lending. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  The eligibility criteria shall include (i) a concession agreement with service exclusivity, (ii) location, (iii) compliance \n\nwith the PRC\u2019s environmental standards, and (iv) the exclusion of category A projects. \n\n8  ADB. 2014.

The \nframework  agreement  will  lay  out  the  concession\u2019s  components,  which \nmay  consist  of  separate  detailed  BOT,  TOT,  or  DBFO  sub-agreements. \nEach subproject will be implemented in accordance with granted approvals \nand  during  construction  and  operation  be  subject \nto  government \ninspections  for  various  aspects,  including  environment,  land  acquisition, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  ethnic  minorities,  labor,  safety,  quality,  and \nsanitation. \nCWE  will  centralize  subproject  development,  procurement,  and  financing \narrangements across its operations. CWE will establish project companies \nfor each subproject. \nJanuary 2017\u2013December 2020  \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperations arrangements \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction arrangements  CWE  will  centrally  coordinate  the  construction  of  each  subproject,  which \nwill  be  managed  by  a  dedicated  team.  Various  construction  components, \nprimarily  civil  works,  equipment  procurement,  and  installation  will  be \noutsourced  to  subcontractors.  Goods  and  services  will  be  procured  from \nADB  member  countries  in  a  transparent  manner  through  competitive \nbidding. \n \nUnder  BOT  and  TOT,  CWE  will  charge  wastewater  tariffs  based  on  the \nvolume  of  treated  wastewater,  subject  to  a  minimum  volume  of  offtake \nguaranteed by the host government. Tariffs will be set to ensure an agreed \nreturn  on  investment  and  indexed  to  operating  costs  and  inflation.  Under \nDBFO,  payments  to  CWE  are  made  in  installments  based  on  the \nachievement  of  construction  milestones  and  provision  of  operational \nservices on an agreed schedule. \nMajor  operational  costs \nadministrative and maintenance expenses. \nOperation  and  maintenance  will  generally  be  handled  by  each  subproject \ncompany\u2019s  staff,  who  will  be  either  transferred  from  CWE  or  recruited \nexternally. \nKey performance indicators, including output and outcome measures, will \nbe  reported  by  CWE  and  monitored  by  ADB  throughout  the  life  of  the \nproject. \n\ninclude  electricity,  materials, \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nMajor cost structure \n\nlabor,  and \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BOT  =  build-operate-transfer,  CWE  =  China Water  Environment  Group,  DBFO = \ndesign-build-finance-operate, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, TOT = transfer-own-transfer. \nSource: ADB. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  to  CWE  consists  of  (i)  an  A  loan  of  up  to  $150  million \n17. \nequivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii)  a  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $100  million \nequivalent in US dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the A loan from its ordinary capital resources \nand the complementary loan from participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record.  \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n18. \n\nADB involvement in the project is justified by the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe project will have a significant demonstration impact as the first ADB private \nsector intervention to support an emerging PPP model for integrated wastewater \nmanagement,  wherein  a  single  concessionaire  designs  and  implements  a \ncomprehensive lake and river pollution prevention and rehabilitation program that \ninvolves multiple environmental interlocking facilities and services. \nThe  project  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  long-standing  public  sector  interventions  and \nstrong  nonsovereign  track  record  in  wastewater  treatment  and  water  supply  in \nthe PRC, especially in less developed regions. \nADB\u2019s requirements will ensure that CWE implements high quality environmental \nand  social  management,  commercial  best  practice,  and  strong  corporate \ngovernance. \nADB  will  act  as  a  catalyst  to mobilize  commercial  cofinance  by  linking  river  and \nlake rehabilitation in the PRC, a new area of private participation, with the bank \nfinancing community. \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n27. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS),  2009,  the  project  is \nclassified as category B for environment, category B for involuntary resettlement, and category \nC for indigenous peoples. The project team conducted environmental and social safeguards due \ndiligence  to  assess  the  potential  impacts  and  risks  associated  with  CWE\u2019s  operations.  This \nrevealed that each subproject\u2019s potential environmental impacts during civil construction works \ninclude  the  generation  of  dust,  air  emissions,  noise,  wastes,  soil  erosion,  and  water  pollution. \nHowever, these are expected to be short-term and localized. During the operations phase, key \nenvironmental impacts could include (i) noise impacts due to plant operations; (ii) water quality \nimpacts due to poor effluent quality; (iii) odor and health risks due to poor sludge management; \nand  (iv)  health  and  safety  risks  due  to  the  buildup  of  gases,  particularly  in  underground \nwastewater  treatment  facilities.  Potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with  construction \nand  operation  can  be  mitigated  by  following  international  engineering  best  practices  and \nimplementing  an  appropriate  environmental  management  plan. \nInitial  environmental \nexaminations will be prepared for ADB-funded subprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS. Prior \n\n \n\n\f 6\n\nfound \n\nfor  ADB \n\nfinancing, \n\nto  the  first  disbursement,  CWE  will  update  its  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS) to include screening procedures to avoid subprojects with the potential to be classified \nas category A for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nA  corporate  audit  of  CWE  and  four  of  its  existing  subprojects,  which  are  currently  not \n28. \ncandidates \nin  place  environmental  and  social  safeguards \ncommensurate  with  the  impacts  and  risks  of  each.  13  Where  gaps  were  found,  CWE  was \ninformed  of  corrective  actions  which  ADB  recommends  are  addressed  and  reflected  in  the \nupdated  ESMS.  CWE\u2019s  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social \nand environmental impacts are deemed adequate, but will be enhanced through company-wide \ncapacity  development  (covering  both  CWEI  and  XWE)  in  the  implementation  of  the  updated \nESMS. \n \n29. \nSimilarly,  the  audit  found  that  land  required  for  existing  projects  had  been  acquired  in \naccordance with local laws and to a standard consistent with ADB\u2019s SPS. No subproject impacts \non  distinct  and  vulnerable  ethnic minority groups  were  detected  in  past  subprojects,  and  none \nare expected from future subprojects. New facilities are expected to be constructed in sparsely \npopulated suburban areas classified as development zones or reserved land.14 This will reduce \nthe impacts on local populations from the acquisition of land and rights-of-way. If the reserved \nstate-owned  land  is  insufficient  for  future  subprojects,  collective  land  will  be  acquired. \nUnderground pipelines are laid along roads and rivers, which induce temporary land occupation \nimpacts  only.  CWE  will  work  with  government  agencies  to  ensure  that  subprojects  avoid  or \nminimize  the  need  for  residential  or  arable  land,  but,  where  displacement  impacts  are \nunavoidable, CWE will put in place action plans commensurate with impacts, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  SPS  requirements.
