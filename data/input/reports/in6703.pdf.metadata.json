BACKGROUND \n \n1.  On 25 March 2002, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) met to \nconsider the recommendations of the Board Inspection Committee pursuant to the inspection of \nthe ADB-funded Samut Prakarn Wastewater Management Project (the Project) in Thailand.1 At \nthat meeting, the Board noted the report of the Board Inspection Committee and, after due \ndeliberation, approved its recommendations as quoted in paragraph 1 of Board document \nIN.251-02 dated 3 October 20022. \n \n2.  This is the second semiannual report to the Board and covers 26 September 2002 to 25 \nMarch 2003. At the time of writing this report, staff were aware that ongoing investigations into \nthe Project by the Government had resulted in the main turnkey contract being declared null and \nvoid. It is unclear at this stage what steps the Government will take next, or what form the \nProject may take as a result of the investigations. Staff are in discussion with the Executing \nAgency and the Ministry of Finance in Thailand on what the future of the Project will be. \n \nII.  COMPENSATION PLAN \n3.  The Board required Management to provide semiannual reports on the status of \nimplementation of the resettlement plan, including payment of compensation. \n \n4.  The criteria for compensation and the compensation packages for the two licensees in \nthe economic exclusion zone have been discussed with the licensees, and a draft agreement \nhas been prepared. The draft is currently being reviewed by the counsel of Thailand\u2019s Pollution \nControl Department (PCD). The compensation agreement and relocation were to have been \nmade around November 2002. However, Project construction has been delayed which has \nallowed  the  licensees  to  continue  farming  for  one  more  season,  until  around  May  2003. \nArrangements are also being made for the licensees to continue their mussel farming in a \nnearby area as of the next farming season (around October 2003), in order to provide them with \na  sustainable  means  of  earning  a  livelihood.  A  compensation  plan,  including  the  formal \nagreement, is expected to be complete around mid-2003. \n \n5.  The community facilitator under ADB Technical Assistance (TA) 3517-THA3, supported \nby a team of researchers, has been consulting with the community on a daily basis, and has \nhad a key role in negotiating the compensation plan. Progress meetings were held between \nPCD, ADB, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation every month to discuss and \nmonitor the compensation arrangements. The facilitator has also arranged for ADB staff to \nconsult with the licensees, who have advised ADB that they are satisfied with the compensation \narrangements. ADB continues to have an active role in the consultation process, and all other \naspects of the Project, with the assistance of the Special Project Administration Mission in \nThailand. The consultation process has also been instrumental in introducing and pilot testing \nenhanced mussel farming techniques in the area, supervised by Kasetsart University, together \nwith a local community leader. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

Community Assessment and Development for the Samut Prakarn Wastewater Management Project. \nManila ", "2  \nIII.  MONITORING SYSTEMS \n6.  The Board required Management to provide semiannual reports on the system for \nmonitoring of socioeconomic impacts, based on baseline data. \n \nA.  Socioeconomic Monitoring \n7.  The baseline data collection to mid-2002 is described in the first semiannual report. \nSince that time, a further attitudinal survey has been carried out among customers within the \nservice  area  in  late-2002/early-2003  by  Assumption  Bangkok  University.  The  results  are \ncurrently  being  collated  and  analyzed  to  enhance  the  knowledge  of  community  profiles \nestablished  under  previous  work.  In  respect  of  the  Khlong  Dan  community,  continuous \nawareness and consultation efforts under TA 3517-THA are providing qualitative supplementary \nbaseline information, which indicates that awareness about the Project is improving within the \ncommunity in general, and this is removing some of the concerns about the Project and its \nimpacts. However, it should be noted that the community facilitator has not been able to engage \nthe  project  opponents  in  any  meaningful  dialogue.  This  group  continues  to  be  staunchly \nopposed to the Project. \n \nB.  Public Health Monitoring \n8.  Since the first semiannual report, further data has been collected from the Samut \nPrakarn Public Health Office and the Bang Bo hospital (Bang Bo is district that includes Khlong \nDan). The main indicators of waterborne diseases remain an area of concern. PCD has advised \nADB that the monitoring committee, to be established before the plant starts operating, will be \nresponsible for collecting and managing data. Details will be included in the benefit monitoring \nand evaluation program. \n \nC.  Environmental Monitoring \n9.  As stated in the first semiannual report, in late 1998 PCD put in place an extensive \nenvironmental monitoring program. The data collected constitutes the baseline situation for \nevaluating environmental impacts after the plant starts operating. Data collection covers coastal \nseawater in the vicinity of the outfall (every 3 months), inland khlongs (every 6 months), marine \necology  around  the  area of the outfall (twice per year), coastal ecology (twice per year), \npathogen levels in mussels and cockles (once per crop), heavy metals in mussels and cockles \n(once per crop), and heavy metal content in locally farmed fish (once every dry season). The \nmeteorological data collection station established at the treatment plant site in December 2001 \nis  enhancing  PCD's  baseline  data,  which  will  permit  more  accurate  odor  predictions  and \nmanagement.  \n \n10.  The monitoring program for the marine environment off the coast of Samut Prakarn \ncontinues to indicate that the seawater quality is degraded. Coliform bacteria levels remain high, \npollutant spikes from coastal industries are still noticeable, and heavy metal concentrations in \nthe  locally  grown  mussels  and  cockles  are  very  high.  The  inland  khlongs  are  extremely \ndegraded due to the very high organic loads and very low oxygen levels, and are likely to \nbecome ecologically dead unless appropriate wastewater management is established in the \narea. \n \n ", "    3 \nIV.  COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT \n11.  The Board required Management to provide semiannual reports on the progress in \ncommunity involvement. \n \n12.  TA  3517-THA  continues  to  help  improve  communication  with  the  Khlong  Dan \ncommunity, and has assisted in creating a greater awareness of the Project. As noted in the first \nsemiannual  report,  however,  the  TA  has  not  been  able  to  engage  the  group  of  project \nopponents in any meaningful dialogue. During the initial phase of TA 3517-THA, it was noted \nthat community members were concerned about the impact of the Project on their livelihoods. \nThe second phase of the TA, which commenced in July 2002, aims to address the concerns \nraised in the first phase, develop a compensation plan, and in consultation with the Khlong Dan \ncommunity develop a community enhancement fund. The compensation plan is discussed in \nparagraphs 4-5. TA 3517-THA is supporting a continuing dialogue with the community on the \ntypes of small-scale development activities that could be implemented through the fund. TA \nconsultants have explained to the community that the proposed fund be established by way of a \nsmall premium on the tariff, which could be managed locally. The issue however, is the time lag \nbetween the stimulation of community interest and ideas, and the time that the fund will be \navailable\u2014possibly in 2\u20133 years. This might lead to a loss of faith by the community, and is \ncurrently under review by PCD. Staff have noted during consultation visits that there appears to \nbe much enthusiasm, and several ideas for the use of the community enhancement fund have \nbeen  discussed,  such  as  erosion  protection  works,  flood  protection  works,  and  improved \nmanagement practices for cockle farmers. \n \n13.  Also,  under  the  second  phase  of  TA  3517-THA,  the  possibility  of  establishing  an \nenvironment guarantee fund may be explored, under which adverse environmental impacts \narising from project operations could be addressed promptly. Funding would be by a levy on the \nwastewater tariff, in accordance with the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle. Work on this initiative has \nbeen deferred until later in 2003, because start-up of the plant has been delayed, and PCD \nresources are constrained at this stage. This is a critical activity, as it will be the only opportunity \nfor the community to become involved in identifying and assessing risks associated with the \npotential environmental impacts of the Project. \n \n14.  Since the first semiannual report, there has been a continued and effective dialogue with \na cross-section of the Khlong Dan community, effected through the community facilitator and his \nteam engaged under TA 3517-THA. Following the community partnership initiatives in Sriracha \nin August 2002 to enhance mussel farming methods and add value to the processing of \nmussels, Kasetsart University continues to work with the community in Khlong Dan to pilot new \ntechniques for mussel farming. At this stage, some 10 pilot farms have been established off the \ncoast of Khlong Dan. Within the community, awareness is growing about the facts surrounding \nthe Project. \n \nV.  ODOR AND EFFLUENT MANAGEMENT \n15.  The Board required Management to provide a semiannual report on problems \nassociated with odor and effluent (if any), together with a description of measures taken. \n \n16.  The issue of odor has been analyzed extensively since the early stages of the project \ndesign, and the impact at Klong Dan is expected to be very low. The meteorological station, \nbuilt at the treatment plant site, continues to collect local data, which will be used to more \naccurately predict odor levels at the treatment plant site. Model refinement is currently being \n   ", "4  \ncarried out by Mahidol University at the Bang Poo industrial estate, where existing odor levels \nare being used to refine the calibration of the model. Odor will be monitored by the monitoring \ncommittee.  \n \n17.  Effluent discharge will be managed both at the source of generation and at the final point \nof disposal. The cleaner production program for industry, as reported in the first semiannual \nreport, now has over 600 members, and has resulted in reduced pollution loading that saves \nseveral  million  dollars  each  year.  In  addition,  a  set  of  regulations,  termed  \"discharge \nrequirements,\u201d has been drafted. These regulations are intended to encourage factories to \nconnect to the system, while ensuring their wastes do not adversely impact the treatment \nsystem and the environment. Some factories appear to be claiming in the media that the \nlegislative and regulatory frameworks will give them the option of discharging into the local \nkhlongs and environment and, therefore, they do not need to pay the costs of connection and \ndischarge. This situation will still lead to degradation of the local environment. PCD is consulting \nwith the factory owners on this aspect, and is attempting to demonstrate the benefits of \nconnecting to the system. PCD needs to increase its public relations efforts to address this \naspect. A recent survey by Assumption Bangkok University, referred to in paragraph 7, indicates \nthat over 60% of factory owners are interested in connecting to the system. The willingness of \ncommercial premises to connect to the systems is 78% and that of residences 77%. \n \n18.  PCD has advised ADB that procedures for odor and effluent monitoring are essentially in \nplace, in accordance with the environmental management plan, and can be implemented as \nsoon as the plant starts operating. PCD has cautioned, however, that no budget has yet been \nallocated for the monitoring, and that this needs to be addressed urgently. \n \nVI.  CONCLUSIONS \n19.  In conclusion,  \n \n(i)  a draft compensation plan, which has been developed in consultation with the \nproject-affected persons, is substantially complete; completion has been delayed \nto around mid2003, but this has no adverse impact on the affected farmers; \n \n(ii)  monitoring mechanisms are substantially in place to cover the environmental, \nsocioeconomic, and public health aspects of the Project; however, budget to \ncover these activities after the plant starts operating needs to identified and \napproved; \n \n(iii)  to  the  extent  possible,  arrangements  are  being  developed  for  community \ninvolvement  in  monitoring  activities,  and  community  involvement  in  the \nidentification and assessment of environmental risks is planned, but needs to be \nmonitored; and \n \n(iv)  odor and effluent management measures are essentially in place, in accordance \nwith the environmental management plan. \n \n20.  The future of the Project is uncertain given the recent developments concerning the \nturnkey contract (paragraph 2).  Discussions are underway to ascertain the Government\u2019s plans \non project implementation and management in order to determine a course of action in line with \nthe loan agreements for the Project. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)", "Author": "Aurora Jorge", "ModDate": "D:20030408142449+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20030407144506+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word"}}
