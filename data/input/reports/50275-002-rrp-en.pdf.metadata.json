The project will provide \ninnovative  and  industry-relevant  technology  education  and  research  facilities,  help  quality \ncurriculum  design  and  academic  staffing  aligned  with  international  standards,  and  provide \ncompetitive grant scheme and capacity development opportunities.  \n   \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nSri Lanka has recorded steady economic growth of 5.2% per annum for the last decade.2 \n3. \nPer capita gross national income was $3,840 in 2017, well on track to become an upper middle-\nincome  country.3 To  achieve  higher  incomes  and  better  standards  of  living,  the  government \nenvisions transforming to a knowledge-based economy by 2025.4 Investment in human capital is \nprioritized for economic diversification and enhanced productivity.5 Sri Lanka ranked 73rd in the \nHuman  Development  Index,  outperforming  other  lower  middle-income  countries,  and  this  is \nattributed to good access to education.6 Challenges remain in quality of learning, particularly in \nscience,  technology,  and  engineering  subjects,  as  well  as  relevance  to  the  labor  market, \nespecially in the face of rapid technological changes. Higher education plays an instrumental role \nin producing a future-ready labor force, but Sri Lanka\u2019s higher education system is facing several \nchallenges. \n\n \n4. \nLimited access. Higher education opportunities are limited. The gross enrollment rate is \n18.9%,  which  is  far  lower  than  that  of  the  upper  middle-income  country  average  of  50.7%.7 \nIncreasing  demand for  higher  education  is  evident from  steep competition for  public  university \nadmission, the  large  number  of  external  degree  program  students,  and increasing  numbers  of \nstudents seeking private higher education. Disciplines offered are largely skewed toward liberal \narts,  social  studies,  and  management,  and  less  than  20%  of  graduates  are  from  science  and \nengineering subjects. As a result, less than four science, technology, and engineering graduates \nare available for every 100 age cohort in Sri Lanka, compared with over 15 in Malaysia and 30 in \n\n                                                \n1  The  proposed  project  will  support  new  degree  programs  in  engineering  technology,  biosystems  technology,  and \ninformation  and  communication  technology  under  the  newly  introduced  technology  faculties,  as  well  as  degree \nprograms in engineering faculty at Sri Jayewardenepura University.

New York.  \n7  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  Institute  for  Statistics  http://uis.unesco.org/ \n\n(accessed on 20 February 2018). \n\n\fthe  Republic  of  Korea.  Private  higher  education  is  focusing  on  management  and  information \ntechnology (IT), where capital investment is moderate. The main constraint is high upfront capital \ninvestment requirements for higher education in science, technology, and engineering disciplines. \n  \nQuality  concerns.  Research  and  practical  learning  in  science,  technology,  and \n5. \nengineering are limited because of lack of laboratory facilities, researchers, and capital investment. \nLack of qualified academic staff constrains quality of teaching, learning, and research. There were \n5,440 academic staff in 2016, but less than 50% have a doctor of philosophy degree. Recruiting \nand retaining qualified academic staff is difficult because better working conditions (e.g., salary \nand  organizational  culture)  offered  in  the  private  sector  and  overseas.  The  vacancy  rate  at \nuniversities  was  estimated  to be  28%  in 2014. The  pedagogy  should transform from  an  input-\nbased  approach  to  outcome-based  education  and  student-centered  learning  to  foster  critical \nthinking  and  problem-solving  competencies  as  well  as  other  modern  job  market  requirements \nsuch as entrepreneurship and leadership, teamwork and collaboration, and communication.  \n \n6. \nAreas  of  improvement  for  job  market  relevance.  Job  placement  rates  are  high  for \ngraduates  in  IT  (92%),  engineering  (92%),  and  science  (83%)  compared  with  overall  average \n(66%).  However,  even  among  science,  technology,  and  engineering  graduates,  cognitive  and \nnoncognitive skills, such as analytical thinking, problem solving, communications, and teamwork, \nneed  further  improvement.  Degree  programs  are  more  theory-oriented  and  lack  application  or \npractical use of knowledge and skills. Such deficiency becomes evident in the skills gaps among \ncurrent industry managers from those disciplines. Flexibility and ability to continuously learn and \nupgrade  skills  are  the  competencies  most  needed  for  science,  technology  and  engineering \ngraduates to survive and lead the rapid technological changes.  \n\n \n7. \nGender  dimension.  Over  60%  of  undergraduates  are  female  students  in  Sri  Lanka. \nHowever, female enrollment is more concentrated in liberal arts and social studies (82.4%) where \nunemployment is the highest. Gender parity in computer science or IT and technology faculties \n(50.4%  and  45.6% female)  is  nearly  achieved,  and around  22.0%  of  engineering  students  are \nfemale.  This  is  higher  than  the  developed-country  average.  Encouraging  more  women  to  take \ntechnology disciplines will increase women\u2019s career opportunities in technical areas where wages \nare high. This would also help challenge stereotypical gender roles in the economy, and increase \nwomen\u2019s labor market participation in nontraditional areas.  \n\n \nOpportunities \n\n8. \nin  science,  technology,  and  engineering  education.  Despite \nimpressive  employment  outcomes,  there  were  only  5,012  admissions  for  science,  technology, \nand engineering in 2016, which is only 17.2% of total admissions. The main constraint is financing. \nThe  government  expects  that  priority  economic  development  initiatives,  like  the  Colombo\u2013\nTrincomalee  Economic  Corridor,  would  generate  580,000  incremental  jobs  in  manufacturing \nbetween 2020 and 2032, and around 10%\u201315% of such job opportunities would require advanced \nskills in technology. One of the constraints to such development initiative would be the lack of a \nskilled workforce.  \n \n9. \nGovernment  initiatives.  In  response  to  the  high  demand  for  a  technically-oriented \nworkforce  and  the  need  for  diversifying  pathways  for  youth,  the  government  introduced  the \ntechnology stream to secondary education (grades 12 and 13) in 2013. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) supported this initiative through its Education Sector Development Program.8 Since \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Results-Based Loans \n\nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2015,  around  7,000  technology  stream  students  have  become  qualified  for  higher  education \nannually. The government selected 11 public universities to open new technology faculties to offer \nhigher  education  for  technology  stream  students. 9 In  2016,  2,016  students  were  enrolled  in \ntechnology faculties. With the support from the World Bank, the government has already provided \nfinancing  to  get  the  technology  faculties  started  for  8  public  universities. 10 The  government \nrequested ADB support for the remaining 3 universities\u2014Kelaniya, Rajarata, and Sabaragamuwa \nto  develop  their  technology  faculties.  In  addition,  the  government  requested  ADB  to  support \nestablishment of an engineering faculty at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura which is yet to \nbe supported by other development partners. \n\n \n10. \nLessons  and  project  focus.  In  addition  to  very  much  needed  modern  facilities  and \nqualified  faculty  members,  these  middle-tier  universities  should  introduce  new  practices  in \npedagogy, student guidance, and industry linkages. Lessons from previous development partner \nhigher  education  support  indicate  that  developing  new  technology  and  engineering faculties  in \nthese universities will result in opportunities to demonstrate strong industry linkages, employment \nfocus,  and  other  innovative  approaches,  avoiding  the  accumulated  inertia  of  past  academic \nbureaucracy. Such approaches would set examples for other faculties within the universities to \nfollow.  A  competitive grant  scheme  will  be  used to encourage  collaborations  with industry  and \ninternational university partners.11  \n \nAlignment with country strategy. Increasing access to higher education, especially with \n11. \ntechnology  focus  and  industry  demand,  is  a  priority  in  the  government\u2019s  medium-term \ndevelopment  strategy  (footnote  5).  The  project  is  fully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for Sri Lanka, and contributes to pillar 1 (promoting economic diversification \nand  productivity  enhancement)  by  upgrading  human  capital. 12 The  project  is  included  in  the \ncountry  operations  business  plan  2018\u20132020. 13  The  project  will  support  the  government  in \npreparing a new higher education project proposed for 2021 (output 5).  \n \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB support brings additional value beyond infrastructure by (i) \n12. \nadopting the latest facility design features for higher technology education, green building, and \nrenewable energy  solutions;  (ii)  supporting  climate-proofing  design in  infrastructure  to address \nvulnerability to climate change risk, especially floods from increased unpredictable precipitation \nand  storm  surges;  (iii)  mobilizing  technical  experts  to  support  academic  program  design;  (iv) \nsupporting  internationally  recognized  accreditation;  and  (v)  including  industry  collaboration, \ninternational university partnerships, and faculty staff capacity development. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with the following  impact: an  educated  and knowledgeable labor \nforce  for  accelerated  economic  growth  is  developed. 14  The  project  will  have  the  following \noutcome: access to employment-oriented higher technology education improved.15  \n \n                                                \n9  These are the universities of Colombo, Sri Jayewardenepura, Kelaniya, Jaffna, Ruhuna, Eastern, South Eastern, \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nRajarata, Sabaragamuwa, Wayamba, and Uva Wellessa.  \n\n10 The World Bank. 2017.

Renewable energy  systems \n(solar  and  wind)  will  be  incorporated  in  the  buildings.  The  facilities  will  support  the  latest \npedagogical approaches in higher education, such as project-based learning, peer learning, and \nstudent-centered  learning,  using  flexibly  adjustable  spaces  for  different  types  of  research  and \nindustry collaborations. Each university will incorporate adequate laboratory facilities for practical \nlearning.  All  universities  will  include  industry  collaboration  and  innovation  centers  designed  to \nmeet different industry demands.16 Operation of such industry collaboration facilities will also be \nsupported with a competitive grant scheme (output 3). The universities will carry out joint activities \nsuch as training and exchange programs to maximize the utilization of laboratories and industry \ncollaboration and innovation centers as well as peer-learning of good practices. The new faculties \nwill include facilities that empower female students and academic and nonacademic staff in the \nacademic and social life of the university such as a day care center. This will also help male staff \nshare the child care burden of working spouses and promote balanced gender roles.  \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Quality  and  industry-relevant  higher  technology  education  programs \nimplemented. This output will support development of new strains of technology and engineering \nprograms in four universities, differentiated based on industry demand, university strengths, and \nstrategic  niches.  The  universities  will  develop  complete  degree  program  curricula  up  to  fourth \nyear,  incorporating  industry  inputs  and  aligned  with  international  standards.  The  curricula  will \ninclude subjects or modules to instill entrepreneurship in students, organize mentorship programs \nlinking students and entrepreneurs, and inspire students through career guidance centers (output \n4).  Delivery  of  academic  programs  will  also  incorporate  best  practices  in  technical  education \n(outputs 3 and 4). Bachelor of engineering technology degree programs will be aligned with the \nSydney Accord, and bachelor of engineering degrees with the Washington Accord, and both will \nbe accredited by the Sri Lanka Institution of Engineers as international standards. Other programs \nwill  seek  suitable  international  accreditation  within  the  project  period.  This  quality  assurance \nmechanism  through  accreditation  will  ensure  the  graduates\u2019  qualifications  are  internationally \nrecognized, and maintain the quality of the program over time. This output will also ensure there \nare adequate qualified academic staff for the new technology programs. The project will support \nrecruitment and training of academic staff so that at least 90% of approved cadre positions are \nfilled, and at least 60% of those appointed are doctors of philosophy. The universities will recruit \nand retain qualified female academic staff.   \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Industry  linkages  and  international  collaborations  strengthened.  This \noutput will ensure the curricula developed and implemented under output 2 are well informed by \nindustry  demand  and  international  best  practices,  and  the  physical  facilities  established  under \noutput 1 are fully utilized. The universities will develop joint proposals with industry partners for (i) \nresearch and development activities to resolve industry problems or come up with new products \nor  services; (ii)  customized  training  programs to meet  industry  demand in technology  areas to \nimprove students\u2019 employability or upgrade existing workers\u2019 skills; and (iii) other innovations in \nindustry\u2013university  linkages.  The  universities  can  also  establish  partnerships  with  renowned \nforeign universities in (i) faculty or student exchange programs; (ii) capacity building for innovative \n\n                                                \n16 Examples  include  (i)  a  collaborative  research  and  development  space  for  industry  use,  leveraging  university  lab \nfacilities  and  human  resources;  (ii)  a  pilot  plant  or  lab  whereby  industry  can  use  university  facilities  and  human \nresources  to  develop  plant  facility  design  and/or  prototype  products;  and  (iii)  test  centers.  More  models  will  be \nexplored through industry and international university partnerships (output 3).  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fteaching and learning in higher education; and (iii) joint research activities, especially in industry-\nrelevant areas. The project will provide funding to support proposals competitively selected by a \ntechnical committee established by the Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs (MHECA) \nand University Grants Commission. \n\n \n17. \nOutput  4:  Faculty  management  capacity  strengthened.  This  output  will  enhance \nfaculty staff capacity in creating a modern and dynamic academic culture focusing on developing \na  future-ready  workforce.  Staff  performance  management  systems  will  be  strengthened  to \ncontinuously improve teaching and learning practices of academic staff, and industry collaboration. \nFaculty staff will be trained in areas such as innovative teaching and learning, student services, \nand industry collaboration and services so that employment-oriented technology programs can \nbe  effectively  supported.  Non-academic  staff  capacity  will  be  also  strengthened  through \nstructured  professional  development  programs  in  selected  areas  such as  library  management, \nstudent services and counseling, laboratory management, and project management. The output \nwill  ensure  that  the  universities  have  dedicated  centers  for  career  guidance  that  will  facilitate \nindustry  attachment  programs  for  students,  especially  for  the  career  progression  of  female \ngraduates, through mentoring and networking.  \n \n18. \nOutput  5:  New  higher  education  project  preparation  supported.  This  output  will \nsupport new project development focusing on science and technology disciplines and research \nand  development.  The  output  will  support  feasibility  studies,  innovative  designs  including  on \ngender-focused areas, due diligence, risk mitigation measures, and advance actions for project \nreadiness, especially in procurement, for a higher education project proposed for 2021.  \n \nD. \n \n19. \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual. \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $165  million  (Table  1).

Commitment charges for the ADB OCR loan are 0.15% per year to \nbe charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \n20. \nThe government has requested (i) a regular loan of $83.02 million, and (ii) a concessional \nloan of $61.98 million, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the project. \nThe regular loan will have a 29-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft regular loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 18.75 \nyears, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. The concessional loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during \nthe  grace  period  and  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nconcessional loan agreement. The interest and other charges during implementation under the \nloans will be capitalized. \n \n21. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nworks,  goods  (equipment  and  furniture),  short-  and  long-term  training  of  academic  and \nnonacademic staff, consulting services, as well as resources to support the industry linkage and \ninternational  partnership  proposals  through  competition.

The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 12.3%, which \n24. \nis above the 6.0% threshold for social sector projects. The principal benefits considered in the \nanalysis were wages for technology and engineering program graduates. The principal costs are \nfor  civil  works,  equipment,  opportunity  cost  of  attending  universities  (i.e.,  wages  that  can  be \nearned  by  secondary  education  graduates),  laboratory  equipment  replacement,  and  recurrent \ncosts including salaries and maintenance. A sensitivity analysis indicates that overall investment \nwould remain economically viable with a 10% capital cost overrun and a 10% decrease in benefits. \n \nFinancial sustainability. Despite limited fiscal resources in recent years, the government \n25. \nprioritizes  higher  education  in  Vision  2025  (footnote  5).  Expenditure  on  higher  education  has \nincreased in recent years, and expected to increase or at least be maintained at the current level. \nThe  unit  recurrent  cost  of  undergraduate  students  suggests  that  investment  in  engineering \neducation is lower than in other science disciplines. An expenditure analysis indicates that the \nfour universities manage their programs efficiently given the below-average unit recurrent cost of \nundergraduate  students.  The  project  will  introduce  a  competitive  grant  scheme  to  promote \ninnovations,  which  will  supplement  the  relatively  small  budget  for  research  activities  (6.0%  of \ncapital  expenditure  or  2.3%  of  overall  higher  education  budget).  More  budget  allocation  for \nrehabilitation and maintenance of capital assets (capital expenditure) and maintenance services \n(recurrent expenditure) will be required for the sustainability of the project. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nFinancial management. The financial management risk is substantial mainly because of \n(i)  staff  capacity  constraints  (vacant  positions,  capacity  issues,  and  regular  staff  turn-over);  (ii) \ngaps in fixed asset control, information systems, and internal auditor capacity; and (iii) delays in \nexternal audit. A project management unit (PMU) under MHECA and the project implementation \nunits (PIUs) at the four universities will effectively implement the project while mitigating identified \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffiduciary risks. The PMU and PIUs will have dedicated procurement and financial management \nspecialists, and project accountants in addition to MHECA and university staff assigned to support \nthe project for effective segregation of duties and internal check. The PMU will hire a dedicated \ninternal auditor for the project to support the ministry and university internal auditors. The PMU \nwill also source accounting software to be used by all PIUs for efficient financial management and \nreporting, including fixed-asset inventories. A qualified external auditor, confirmed by the Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Department, will be appointed to audit consolidated project financial statements in  a \ntimely manner so that audit findings and recommendations can improve project implementation.   \n \n27. \nProcurement.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  MHECA  and  the \nfour universities have adequate capacity to carry out the project successfully, subject to enforcing \nfiduciary  controls. 18 PMU  and  PIU  staff  will  be  trained  in  overall  procurement  management, \nfocusing  on  the  weaknesses  in  the  current  system  and  practices.  Two  universities  with  less \nexposure to large civil works and goods procurement will be given additional technical support \nand continuous monitoring to fill the identified gaps. All procurement of works, goods, and services \nwill  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB \nProcurement Regulations (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n28. \nAnticorruption.  The  mechanisms  to  investigate  and  combat  corruption  in  the  public \nsector  include the  independent  Commission to Investigate  Allegations  of  Bribery  or  Corruption \nand the Financial Crimes Investigation Division under the Sri Lanka Police. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MHECA, \nand the universities. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described \nin the project administration manual (footnote 19). \n \nC. \n \n29. \nState universities offer undergraduate programs for free with merit-based (40% of seats) \nand regional quota (60%) admissions, allowing greater social inclusion. Increased enrollment in \nemployment-oriented higher education programs will reduce youth unemployment. The project is \ncategorized as gender equity, and the gender action plan has been prepared, informed by focus \ngroup discussions with faculty members and students.19 The project will provide adequate sex-\nsegregated and special-need toilets, and stairs, ramps, and lights will be made accessible to all, \nincluding people with special needs. Academic staff recruitment includes gender considerations. \nSpecial  programs  for  training,  mentoring,  career  guidance,  and  employment  support  will  be \nprovided for female students.  \n \nD. \n \n30. \nsafeguard categories are as follows. \n \n31. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  will  construct  new  faculty  facilities  to \naccommodate more than 5,000 students and faculty staff across four different locations. An initial \nenvironmental examination was prepared for each location, in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS and \nthe  government\u2019s  environmental  requirements  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. 20  Public \nconsultations were carried out with local residents, university staff, and public and private sector \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project\u2019s \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n18 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fagencies. The initial environmental examinations identified environmental impacts by location and \ntime.  Mitigation measures focus  on (i)  solid-waste  management  and  wastewater  drainage  and \ntreatment,  (ii)  reservation  limits  to  minimize  project  impact  to  a  nearby  water  body,  and  (iii) \noccupational  health  and  safety.  The  initial  environmental  examinations  propose  (i)  capacity \nbuilding for the  PMU  and PIUs, (ii)  inclusion  of an  environmental  management  plan  in  bidding \ndocuments, and (iii) inspection and supervision during construction. At the detailed engineering \ndesign stage, the PMU will update and finalize the environmental management plan. Estimated \ncosts to implement this plan were included in the project costs. The PMU will ensure effective \nenvironmental  monitoring  at  all  stages  of  subproject  implementation.  University  management, \nsupported  by  PIUs,  will  be  responsible  for  any  grievances  following  the  existing  practices  for \nuniversity-related matters.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Three out of the four universities acquired lands \n32. \nfor  the  faculty  facility  development;  and  the  fourth  university  already  had  its  own  land.  No \nadditional land will be acquired under this project. The due diligence report confirms that there is \nno involuntary resettlement impact in the acquired land as per the SPS.  \n \n33. \narea as per the SPS.  \n \nE. \n \n34. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C).
