The  project  outputs \ninclude (i) periodic maintenance of nine national roads in the west coast of Luzon, the Visayas, \nand Mindanao; (ii) detailed engineering design of roads to be maintained or improved under the \nproject and future projects; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity in the road subsector. 3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nStrategic  context.  An  efficient  road  subsector  is  crucial  for  the  Philippines\u2019  economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  An  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  analysis  of  roads  in  the \nPhilippines and other countries found that roads are critical as social arteries for the delivery of \ngovernment services, penetration of ideas and cultures, and dissemination of technology to the \npeople. 4 \n \nThe Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 envisions \u201ca safe, secure, efficient, viable, \n4. \ncompetitive,  dependable, \nintegrated,  environmentally  sustainable,  and  people-oriented \nPhilippine  transportation  system.\u201d 5  It  specifies  six  activities  necessary  to  achieve  this  overall \nobjective:  (i)  adopt  a  comprehensive  long-term  national  transport  policy;  (ii)  develop  strategic \ntransport  infrastructure,  and  maintain  and  manage  transport  infrastructure  assets;  (iii) develop \nan  integrated  multimodal  logistics  and  transport  system;  (iv)  separate  the  regulatory  and \noperation  functions  of  transport  and  other  concerned  agencies;  (v)  comply  with  safety  and \nsecurity standards; and (vi) provide links to bring communities into the mainstream of progress \nand  development.  The  project  will  contribute  to  achieving  the  plan\u2019s  objective  by  helping  to \nmaintain and manage transport infrastructure assets, and to strengthen the institutional capacity \nof DPWH, one of the primary agencies in the transport sector. \n \nThe  project  supports  the  key  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  Philippines  of  helping \n5. \nthe country achieve high, inclusive, and sustainable growth. 6 The project has been included in \nthe  ADB  lending  program  to  assist in  improving  the  investment  climate  and  expanding  private \nsector  development  through  the  scaling  up  of infrastructure investments  and  supporting  policy \nreforms. 7  The  project  is  also  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  through  its  focus  on \nimproving  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  as  well  as  investing  in  physical  assets. 8  The \n\n                                                 \n1   OPEC = Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   ADB.  2008.

The Philippines road network carries about 58% of all domestic freight \ntraffic  and  98%  of  domestic  passenger  traffic.  The  national  road  network  comprises  29,630 \nkilometers  (km),  or  14%  of  the  total  road  network  in  the  country,  of  which  73%  is  paved.  The \nnational  road  network  includes  the  main  trunk  roads  running  the  length  and  breadth  of  the \ncountry,  the  main  arterial  roads  (which  provide  direct  access  to  important  population  and \nproduction  centers),  and  national  secondary  roads  (which  provide  access  to  other  population \nand production centers).  \n \n7. \nDespite  its  importance  to  the  national  economy,  the  road  subsector  has  not  received \nadequate funding. During 1999\u20132008, investment in the transport sector averaged less than 1% \nof gross domestic product compared with 4% for other Asian countries. While roads received a \nsubstantial share  of  the  available  investment  funds,  expansion  or  improvement  of  the  network \nhas  been  limited  in  recent  years.  In  addition,  many  roads  deteriorate  prematurely  due  to \ninadequate maintenance. Around 23% of the national road network is in poor condition and in \nneed of rehabilitation. \n \n8. \nRoad  maintenance.  Inadequate  financing  for  the  road  subsector  in  general  is  clearly \nevident  in  the  lack  of  maintenance  of  existing  road  assets.  The  annual  requirement  for \nmaintaining  national  roads  is  estimated  at  about  P16  billion.  However,  annual  expenditures \nthrough 2009 are estimated at about P5 billion, about 30% of the required amount. Financing for \nthe maintenance of national roads is provided from the general budget. Budget allocations for \nroad maintenance have increased significantly since 2008, and such allocations are expected to \nrise  in  the  future.  The  Philippines  does  have  a  special  road  fund  for  maintenance  and \ndesignated  revenues  are  deposited  in  the  fund,  however,  in  recent  budgets  only  about  half  of \nthe  deposited  revenues  have  been  appropriated  for  national  roads.  The  World  Bank  is \naddressing  the  issue  of  insufficient  financing  for  road  maintenance  by  (i)  strengthening  the \noperation  of  the  road  board  and  utilization  of  the  motor  vehicle  user  charge  special  funds;  (ii) \nreviewing and updating the mandate and implementing rules and regulations of the road board \nand special road fund; and (iii) supporting efforts to recover road user costs in order to expand \nthe revenue base to a sustainable level.  \n \n9. \nInstitutional  capacity.  Weak  institutional  capacity  of  government  sector  agencies  has \nlong  affected  the  transport  sector.  Institutional  capacity  constraints  within  DPWH,  the  main \ngovernment  agency  responsible  for  road  management,  have  hampered  development  of  the \nroad  subsector.  ADB\u2019s  2003  country  assistance  program  evaluation  for  the  Philippines  found \nthat aside from the weakness of DPWH in maintaining the national road network, it has also not \naddressed its own institutional weaknesses. 9 In particular, DPWH is aware of the increasing gap \nbetween the technical capacity of its central office in Manila and the regional and district offices \nof  DPWH.  This  situation  has  compounded  the  problem  of  inadequate  funding,  as  capacity \nlimitations have resulted in available budgets not being fully disbursed or not being used most \neffectively. \n \n10. \nEfforts are being undertaken to strengthen DPWH\u2019s institutional capacity. Many of these \nefforts  are  being  supported  by  external  development  partners. 10  The  inadequate  institutional \ncapacity,  low  efficiency  in  road  administration,  and  weak  governance  are  being  addressed \nthrough a number of initiatives financed by the World Bank, Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment, and Japan International Cooperation Agency. The World Bank's National Roads \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2003. Country Assistance Program Evaluation in the Philippines. Manila. \n10  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f3 \n\n \nImprovement  and  Management  Program  Phase  2,  approved  in  2008  with  a  cofinancing  grant \nfrom Australian Agency for International Development, is providing assistance for (i) supporting \noperations  of  the  road  board,  including  improving  road  cost  recovery;  (ii)  improving  DPWH's \nbusiness processes, including expansion of communications networks and computerization and \nstrengthening  internal  controls  and  internal  audits;  (iii)  strengthening  partnerships  with  NGOs \nand  other  road  subsector  stakeholders;  and  (iv)  supporting  pilot  trials  of  commercializing \noperations of district offices, including road maintenance. These activities build on the progress \nmade in these reform areas under the completed World Bank National Roads Improvement and \nManagement Program Phase 1. Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s Road Upgrading and \nPreservation Project, approved in April 2011,  is focusing on (i) controlling vehicle overloading, \n(ii) the enhancement of the quality assurance system for maintenance and construction projects, \n(iii)  improving  disaster  recovery  capacity,  and  (iv)  expansion  of  communications  networks  and \ncomputerization  of  district  offices.  Although  there  is  progress  in  addressing  institutional \nweaknesses  and  lack  of  capacity,  more  substantial  efforts  to  implement  new  methods  and \ntechnologies  are  necessary  to  ensure  that  DPWH's  capacity  is  sufficient  to  plan,  construct, \nmaintain, and manage the national road network. \n \n11. \nGovernance.  As  with  many  other  sectors  of  the  economy,  governance  issues  have \nadversely  affected  transport  development,  with  DPWH  identified  as  one  of  the  main  agencies \nwhere  corruption  is  perceived  to  be  prevalent.  A  summary  of  financial  management, \nprocurement,  corruption,  and  governance  risks  in  the  road  subsector  is  provided  in  the \nsupplementary  linked  document. 11  The  assessment  carried  out  for  the  project  concludes  that \ncorruption  risk  is  above  average  (para.  29).  DPWH  has  begun  intensive  efforts  to  address \ngovernance issues with assistance from ADB, Australian Agency for International Development, \nthe  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners.  First,  DPWH  adopted  an  Integrity \nDevelopment Action Plan in 2005. Second, an Integrity Development Review was conducted in \n2006, which resulted in an action plan on which DPWH reports to the Office of the Ombudsman. \nThird,  a  separate  integrity  development  action  plan  consisting  of  22  steps  was  proposed  to \nprevent corruption through education, deterrence, and partnerships with NGOs and civil society. \nFourth, an integrity strengthening action plan was prepared for the World Bank's National Roads \nImprovement  and  Management  Program  Phase  2,  incorporating  a  comprehensive  range  of \nmeasures  designed  to  build  institutional  capacity  and  governance,  to  strengthen  the  fiduciary \ncontrols over the use of loan proceeds, and to strengthen social accountability and the demand \nfor good governance from civil society. ADB has also provided technical assistance to support \nDPWH\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  governance  through  provision  of  a  procurement  advisor,  and \nstrengthening internal and external accountability. 12 \n \n12. \nThe project will reinforce joint efforts to improve the maintenance, investment, capacity, \nand  governance  issues  facing  the  road  subsector.  The  project  will  address  the  maintenance \nfinancing  shortfall  by  financing  periodic  maintenance  of  nine  national  roads.  The  periodic \nmaintenance, primarily through the provision of new overlays on the existing road surfaces, will \nensure  that  these  infrastructure  assets  are  preserved,  while  other  development  partners  will \nfocus on improving the sustainability of road maintenance funding. The project will address the \ninadequate investment in the national highway network by financing detailed engineering design \nfor  improvement  of  national  roads  to  be  implemented  under  future  projects.  The  large \ninstitutional capacity development component of the project will address capacity shortcomings \nin DPWH central planning and monitoring functions, as well as in district offices, thus supporting \nthe  government\u2019s  decentralization  initiative.  As  part  of  the  project,  DPWH  has  agreed  to \nimplement  the  Anti-Corruption  Action  Plan,  which  focuses  on  increasing  the  transparency  of \n                                                 \n11  Sector Governance Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  ADB.  2009.

As part of this re-\nengagement,  ADB  provided  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  address  governance \nissues in the road subsector and ensure successful implementation of future projects (footnote \n12). The project is designed to facilitate ADB\u2019s engagement in the subsector over the medium-\nterm  through  readiness  to  utilize  additional  financing  based  on  project  performance  criteria \n(para. 23). \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  improved  accessibility  of  transport  infrastructure  and  services.  The \n\n14. \noutcome will be that DPWH manages the road network in the project area more effectively. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe outputs will include (i) periodic maintenance of about 340 km of nine national roads, \n15. \n(ii) detailed engineering design of 3 roads to be maintained under the project and other roads to \nbe maintained or  improved under future projects, and (iii) strengthened institutional capacity in \nthe road subsector.  \n \n16. \nPeriodic  maintenance.  Periodic  maintenance  will  be  carried  out  on  about  340  km  of \nnine  national  roads,  consisting  of  11  road  sections,  located  in  the  west  coast  of  Luzon,  the \nVisayas, and Mindanao.  The roads proposed for inclusion in the project were selected through \na prioritization exercise carried out by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants in \ncollaboration with DPWH. The selection was based on economic return and the minimization of \nsafeguard  issues.  The  selected  roads  are  part  of  a  major  effort  to  preserve  and  improve  the \nnational road network, included in the Philippines Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 and part of a \nlarger  group  of  roads  chosen  for  improvement  by  development  partners  including  the  World \nBank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency.  \n  \n17. \nDetailed design. The project will finance preparation of detailed engineering design for \n101 km of 3 road sections to be maintained under the project and 847 km of national roads to \nbe  maintained  or  improved  as  part  of  future  projects  proposed  for  ADB  financing,  including \nthrough the use of additional financing if the project performs well. \n \nInstitutional  capacity  development.  A  key  output  of  the  project  will  be  institutional \n18. \ncapacity  development  of  DPWH.  Activities  to  be  financed  by  the  project  under  this  output  are \npart of a joint effort by development partners to improve DPWH\u2019s capacity and performance of \nthe  road  subsector.  Capacity  development  activities  were  developed  in  coordination  with  the \nother key development partners and DPWH to ensure that they are complementary and do not \noverlap.  Core  activities  include  (i) institutionalizing  the  road  maintenance  and  management \nsystem; (ii) enhancing the traffic accident recording and analysis system and improving the road \nsafety  audit  system;  (iii) developing  and  installing  a  project  management  information  system; \n(iv) strengthening  DPWH's  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  capability  and \nmainstreaming  gender  in  DPWH's  infrastructure  development;  (v)  improving  communication \n                                                 \n13  ADB.  1996.

The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  the  experiences  of  ADB  and \nother  development  partners  in  the  road  subsector.  Based  on  the  experience  of  World  Bank-\nfinanced road projects, ADB is financing a procurement advisor to monitor the integrity of project \nprocurement and to assist DPWH in the procurement. To address the lessons from ADB\u2019s last \nroad  subsector  project  (footnote  13),  the  institutional  capacity  development  component  will \nstrengthen  DPWH\u2019s  capacity  for  safeguards  compliance  through  improvement  of  right-of-way \nand environmental management. \n \nD. \n \n20. \n$16.5 million equivalent (Table 1).  \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $130.0 million, including taxes and duties estimated at \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nInstitutional capacity development \n\n1.

It  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  to \nprovide  overall  guidance  for  project  implementation.  The  existing  ADB  project  management \noffice  (PMO)  will  be  directly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  civil  works,  engineering \ndesigns, and project coordination. The PMO director will act as full-time project director and be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the project. The environment and social services \noffice of DPWH will be responsible for implementation of the environmental and social aspects \nof the project. Additional financing by ADB may be considered if the project performs well. The \nproject  includes  detailed  design  of  future  road  periodic  maintenance  and  improvements  to \nfacilitate  readiness  for  additional  financing  and  to  provide  a  strong  incentive  for  successful \nproject implementation.  \n \n24. \nthe PAM.   \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \nAdvance contracting \nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nDecember 2011\u2013December 2015 \nDecember 2015 (loan closing date: June 2016) \n\nDPWH \nUndersecretary for PMO operations (chair)  \nRepresentatives from Department of Finance, Department of Budget and \nManagement, and National Economic and Development Authority (members) \nDPWH \nDPWH will be the lead implementing agency.

The \nproject  will  implement  periodic  maintenance  of  existing  national  roads  and  prepare  detailed \nengineering  designs  of  roads  to  be  maintained  or  improved  under  the  project  and  future \nprojects.  The  maintenance  of  national  roads  under  the  project  will  result  in  longer  asset  lives, \nlower transport costs, shorter travel times, and improved road safety. The selection of roads for \ninclusion  in  the  project  and  the  development  of  investment  costs  were  carried  out  in \ncollaboration with DPWH. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic  \n\n26. \nThe project will benefit road users and communities living within the areas of influence of \nthe  national  roads  to  be  maintained  under  the  project.  Road  users  will  benefit  directly  from \nreduced vehicle operating costs, shorter travel times, and improved road safety. Communities in \nthe areas of influence will benefit indirectly through improved connectivity with better access to \nmarkets, economic opportunities, and government and other social services (such as education \nand health). The project will also generate economic benefits by strengthening the institutional \ncapacity of DPWH. This will lead to lower costs for future road projects and better quality of road \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  resulting  in  longer  lives  for  road  assets.  These  benefits  will \naccrue to road users in general and to the Philippine economy. \n \n27. \nEach  of  the  investments  under  the  project  is  economically  viable  when  costs  are \ncompared  with  the  expected  benefits  to  road  users  from  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  and \nsavings in travel time. The project as a whole has an economic internal rate of return of 36.2% \nand a net present value of $161.2 million, using a 12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis shows \nthat  these  results  are  robust  with  respect  to  negative  changes  in  the  key  parameters \ndetermining benefits and costs. Under the worst-case scenario of a 20% increase in costs and a \n20% decrease in benefits, the project still yields an economic internal rate of return of 27.1%. \n \n28. \nContinuing routine maintenance for the roads covered by the project is essential for the \nachievement of the anticipated economic benefits. Inadequate funding of road maintenance has \nbeen  a  long-standing  problem.  The  government,  with  the  support  of  the  World  Bank,  is \naddressing  the  issue  of  sustainable  funding  for  road  maintenance  by  strengthening  the \noperation  of  the  road  board  and  expanding  the  revenue  base  for  and  efficiency  of  use  of  the \nspecial funds collected from the users of motor vehicles. The project will also support improved \nimplementation  of  road  maintenance  through  institutionalization  of  the  road  maintenance  and \nmanagement system. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nA  governance  assessment  for  the  transport  sector  was  undertaken  as  part  of  the  due \n29. \ndiligence process and is summarized in the sector governance risk assessment (footnote 11). It \nconcluded  that  the  corruption  risk  for  the  project  is  above  average  and  that  DPWH  is  widely \nperceived  as  an  agency  where  corruption  is  prevalent.  Risks  identified  relate  to  poor  public \nexpenditure  and  financial  management,  weaknesses  in  public  procurement,  and  corruption.  A \ngovernance risk mitigation plan is included in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 15  \n \n                                                 \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n30. \nDPWH  is  committed  to  implementing  various  reforms  and  introducing  measures  to \nreduce these risks and to mitigate their effects, particularly through the introduction of e-based \nsystems  for  procurement  and  financial  management  practices  that  will  increase  transparency \nand  reduce  the  potential  for  corruption.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  are  supporting \nDPWH  in  these  efforts  by  building  capacity  and  strengthening  the  role  of  civil  society  in  the \nmonitoring of DPWH performance. ADB has provided TA to support the implementation of the \ngovernance  components  included  in  the  risk  assessment and  risk  management  plan  (footnote \n12).  This  includes  assistance  with  project  procurement  through  provision  of  a  procurement \nadvisor and other measures related to internal auditing and civil society monitoring. The Project \nincludes  specific  measures  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency,  included  in  an \nanticorruption action plan. 16 DPWH has agreed to implement the anticorruption action plan by \nproject completion. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  DPWH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nThe  project  is  a  general  intervention  with  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts  which  will \nresult  from  the  lowering  of  transport  costs  for  local  people  and  agricultural  produce,  and \nimproving  access  to  social  services  and  economic  opportunities.  The  project  will  also  provide \nsome opportunities to recruit local labor during construction and road maintenance. The project \nis  classified  as  some  gender  benefits.  Potential  gender  equity  benefits  are  women\u2019s  improved \naccess  to  social  services  and  income  opportunities.  For  project-related  employment,  men  and \nwomen  will  be  equally  paid  for  work  of  equal  value,  and  no  child  labor  will  be  employed.  The \ninstitutional  capacity  development  output  will  also  include  raising  the  awareness  and \nprominence of gender issues in DPWH activities. \n \n33. \nA  potential  adverse  social  impact  is  the  increased  risk  of  exposure  to  HIV/AIDS  and \nother  sexually  transmitted  infections,  given  that  improved  transport  infrastructure  can  provide \nthe  opportunity  for  people  to  interact  and  engage  in  behaviors  that  put  them  at  risk  of  such \ninfections. Also, the presence of construction workers during implementation of civil works can \ncontribute to the spread of such infections in communities near construction camps and in the \nworkers\u2019  communities  of  origin.  To  address  this  risk,  DPWH  will  ensure  that  HIV/AIDS \nawareness  and  prevention  activities  are  conducted  for  local  communities  and  construction \nworkers. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  and  an  initial  environmental \n34. \nexamination (IEE) 17 was prepared consistent with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  IEE  does  not  identify  any  major  environmental  concerns  due  to \nconstruction and operation of the project roads. Works will be undertaken within existing rights-\nof-way with no road widening or realignment. The IEE includes an environmental management \nplan  (EMP),  which  details  the  mitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring  activities, \ninstitutional \nresponsibilities,  and  environmental  management  capacity  building.  Public \nconsultations  were  held  in  all  project  provinces  and  along  all  project  roads  and  included \ninterviews and meetings with the affected people. The results of the consultations were positive, \nwith people considering that the roads will bring significant economic benefits to the region and \n                                                 \n16 Anticorruption Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nin  monitoring \n\n \nwill increase trade flows. DPWH will ensure that relevant EMP provisions are included in bid and \nfor  detailed  design,  project  supervision,  and  civil  works.  During \ncontract  documents \nconstruction, the supervision consultant will assist the environment and social services office of \nDPWH \nthe  contractor\u2019s  environmental  performance  and  overall  EMP \nimplementation. DPWH will submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB; these \nreports will be posted on ADB\u2019s website for public disclosure. DPWH will establish a grievance \nredress  mechanism  to  ensure  that  complaints  of  affected  persons  and  other  stakeholders \nregarding the project\u2019s environmental performance are promptly addressed. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \n35. \npeoples. No resettlement will be required as the project provides only periodic maintenance on \nexisting alignments. No impacts on indigenous peoples are expected to occur as a result of the \nproject.   \n \nF. \n\nRisk and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe main risks associated with the project relate to poor governance and, in particular, \n36. \ncorruption. DPWH has shown strong commitment to improve governance in the transport sector \nand  is  committed  to  implementing  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  with  the \nsupport  of  an  ADB-funded  TA  (footnote  12).  The  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan \ntargets  risks  that  are  (i)  considered  of  critical  importance  to  the  project  and  to  the  transport \nsector,  and  (ii)  likely  to  occur  in  the  absence  of  mitigation.  The  governance  component  of  the \nplan  focuses  on  preventing  corruption  during  procurement,  and  strengthening  internal  and \nexternal  accountability mechanisms.  It  builds on  and  complements  DPWH\u2019s  ongoing  efforts to \nimprove  governance  in  association  with  other  development  partners.  In  addition,  the  project \nincludes an anticorruption action plan, which details specific actions that DPWH will undertake \nto mitigate the risk of corruption during project implementation. \n \nFailure to improve funding for, and delivery of, road maintenance would pose a technical \n37. \nrisk  for  the  project  and  undermine  the  sustainability  of  its  investments.  The  government  is \nstrongly committed to increasing the funding available for road maintenance and is seeking to \nmitigate  this  risk  through  strengthening  the  road  board  and  widening  its  revenue  base  from \nroad-user charges, with assistance from the World Bank. Delivery of road maintenance will be \nimproved through the implementation of the road maintenance and management system under \nthe institutional capacity development output of the project. \n \nA social risk is the possible spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases \n38. \nduring and after project implementation. This risk will be mitigated by an HIV/AIDS awareness \nand  prevention  campaign  aimed  at  civil  works  contractors  and  their  workers,  and  local \ncommunities. \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.  The  benefits  and  impacts  of  the  mitigating \nmeasures are expected to outweigh the costs associated with their implementation.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nPoor financial management \n\nWeaknesses in procurement process \n\nCorruption \n\nInadequate road maintenance  \n\nHIV/AIDS \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nImplementation of the governance components of the risk assessment \nand risk management plan and technical assistance (TA) \nImplementation of the governance components of the risk assessment \nand risk management plan and TA \nImplementation of the governance components of the risk assessment \nand risk management plan, and TA \nStrengthening of the road board and widening of its revenue base from \nspecial funds; institutionalization of the road maintenance and \nmanagement system \nAwareness and prevention activities to be undertaken \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES   \n\n40. \nThe government and DPWH have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n41. \nThe  government  and  DPWH  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  specific  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement.
