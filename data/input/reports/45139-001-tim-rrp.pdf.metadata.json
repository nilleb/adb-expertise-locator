The project will build on existing training programs \nand  facilities  which  have  a  proven  record  of  delivering  quality  skills  training  at  basic  levels.  By \nfilling skills gaps in the current system of technical and vocational education and training (TVET), \nthe  project  will  help  the  government  develop  a  skilled  workforce  and  improve  employment \nopportunities for men and women in Timor-Leste. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe economy of Timor-Leste has been growing strongly, averaging annual growth of more \nthan  10%  since  2007.  Timor-Leste\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  (SDP)  2011\u20132030  aims  to \nsustain double-digit economic growth, with a vision of building a modern, diversified economy by \n2030  focusing  on  high-quality  infrastructure  and  the  petroleum  sector  as  a  significant  industrial \nbase.2 The  SDP  points  to  the  shortage  of  skilled  human  resources  as  a  critical  challenge  in \nachieving  this  vision  and,  in  response,  emphasizes  human  capital  investment,  particularly  job \nskills development, as a key strategy in coming years. \n \n4. \nThe country\u2019s population has been growing rapidly, averaging 2.4% growth in 2004\u20132010, \nand 52% of the nation\u2019s population of 1.1 million is under the age of 20.3 Providing a large young \npopulation with knowledge and skills relevant for the rapidly developing economy and absorbing \nthem into the labor force pose key challenges. The youth unemployment rate (among 15\u201329 year \nolds) is 19% nationally and 27% in urban areas. Underemployment is also extensive, with many \nyoung  people  absorbed  in  the  agriculture  sector  at  low  rates  of  productivity.  Despite  the \nabundance of unemployed and underemployed youth, the fast-growing economy is faced with a \nshortage  of  practically  skilled  Timorese  workers  and  relies  instead  on  considerable  numbers  of \nforeign  workers.  \n \n5. \nThe government\u2019s plan to accelerate infrastructure development in areas  such as roads, \nbuilding  construction,  water  supply,  and  energy  is  driving  demand  for  skilled  workers  in \nconstruction  trades.  With  the  rapid  expansion  of  construction  activities,  the  use  of  construction \nequipment, automobiles, and other transport services is rising rapidly, as is the demand for skilled \nmechanics.  Yet  few  Timorese  workers  have  technical  skills  that  can  support  rapid  infrastructure \nexpansion.  According  to  the  2010  labor  force  survey,  about  13,000  persons  aged  15  and  older \nreported  working  in  construction  industries. 4  Only  3,000  of  these  workers  had  completed \nsecondary, technical, or vocational education, and most of them were likely to work as semiskilled \nor unskilled workers. While there are no precise data on foreign skilled workers, a 2008 survey of \nenterprises  and  recent  field  studies  indicate  that  foreign  workers  fill  key  skilled  positions  in \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

Skills  training  programs  range  from  basic  life  skills  to  specific  occupational  skills.  Many \nvocational  training  programs,  however,  fall  short  in  preparing  trainees  with  skills  required  in  the \nlabor  market  due  to  (i)  their  focus  on  remedial  courses  to  raise  basic  literacy  and  numeracy \namong  trainees,  (ii)  the  programs\u2019  weak  links  to  the  labor  market,  (iii)  a  lack  of  standard \nqualifications for training institutions, and (iv) a lack of qualified teachers. Many training courses \ntend  to  be  supply  driven  or  in  low-cost  areas  such  as  business  administration  and  tourism,  with \npoor links to the needs of the local labor market. \n \n7. \nQuality  assurance  and  more  demand-driven  training  standards  have  recently  been \nadopted in the TVET subsector with support from development partners. To develop competency \nstandards  based  on  industry  inputs  and  to  accredit  vocational  training  providers,  the  National \nLabor  Force  Development  Institute  (INDMO)  was  established  in  2008  as  an  autonomous \nregulatory  agency  under  the  auspices  of  SEFOPE.  Industry  subcommissions  have  been \norganized  to  advise  INDMO  on  competency  standards  and  qualifications  within  their  particular \nindustry. For regulation and accreditation of post-secondary educational institutions, the National \nAgency for Academic Assessment and Accreditation (ANAAA)  was established under the  MOE. \nThe  work  by  the  ANAAA  and  INDMO  formed  the  basis  of  the  national  qualification  framework \n(NQF), which was approved in April 2011. INDMO is responsible for regulating qualification levels \n1\u20134 of vocational training and foundation courses, while the ANAAA is responsible for qualification \nlevels 5\u201310 in higher education.7 \n \nThe  most  recent  review  of  TVET  outcomes  by  SEFOPE  indicates  that  approximately \n8. \n1,900  trainees  completed  vocational  training  courses  in  2009  across  four  technical  areas\u2014\nadministration and finance, tourism and hospitality, construction and mechanics, and agriculture.8 \nFemales  made  up  about  40%  of  these  trainees,  mostly  concentrated  in  administration,  finance, \ntourism,  and  hospitality.  About  32%  of  trainees  were  trained  in  construction  and  mechanical \ntrades.  The  review  identified  15\u201318  providers  as  delivering  quality  training  across  a  range  of \nindustry  areas,  but  mostly  at  basic  qualification  levels. While  there  is  an  increasing  demand  for \nmid-level  technical  workers  (levels  2\u20134),  particularly  in  construction  and  automotive  trades,  no \nvocational  training  provider  is  yet  to  provide  mid-level  skills  training  and  only  a  few  training \nproviders have the capacity to deliver training at higher than basic levels. \n \n9. \nThe project aims to help fill the gap in mid-level skills training (levels 2\u20134) in construction \nand  automotive  trades  by  targeting  and  upgrading  the  strongest  training  providers  to  deliver \n\n                                                \n5  Richard  Curtain.  2009.

Field studies on automotive repair shops and construction companies in Dili were \ncarried out during project preparation. \n\n6  Official acronyms for government agencies are Portuguese acronyms. \n7  For qualification levels 1\u20134 under the NQF, a formal certificate is awarded when a person demonstrates the skills and \nknowledge specified in the industry competency standards, usually acquired through vocational training providers or on \nthe job  training. Level 1 skills generally correspond to  workers being able to undertake  well-defined tasks in their skill \narea; at level 2 workers are able to perform a broader range of tasks in their skill area; level 3 workers are highly skilled \ntechnicians in their fields; and level 4 workers are supervisors. Qualification levels 5\u201310 represent diplomas and degrees \nfrom higher educational institutions, ranging from polytechnic diplomas to university doctorate degrees. \n\n8  SEFOPE. 2011. Review of 2009 TVET Training Outcomes. Dili. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\ftraining  at  higher  than  basic  levels.  Given  past  and  ongoing  assistance  to  basic  education  and \nbasic  skills  training  by  other  development  partners,  the  project  will  focus  its  support  on  specific \nmid-level  vocational  skills  training  through  SEFOPE.  To  implement  mid-level  skills  training,  the \nproject  will  support  the  development  of  competency-based  training  standards  and  improve  the \nquality of teaching staff. It will also facilitate the role of the private sector and strengthen the labor \nmarket  information  system  (LMIS)  to  build  demand-driven  skills  training  that  is  relevant  and \nresponsive to the needs of the expanding Timorese economy. \n \nThe project is aligned with Timor-Leste\u2019s SDP and its focus on accelerated infrastructure \n10. \nand  capacity  development.  The  project  is  the  first  major  step  in  the  engagement  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  TVET  in  Timor-Leste,  in  accordance  with  the  country  partnership \nstrategy (CPS) 2011\u20132015 and country operations business plan 2011\u20132013.9 As indicated in the \nCPS,  ADB\u2019s  extensive  experience  in  TVET  will  assist  the  government  in  addressing  skills \nshortages in infrastructure and other areas of the economy. \n \n11. \nThe  project  is  also  harmonized  with  assistance  provided  by  other  development  partners. \nThe Australian Agency for International Development and the International Labor Organization are \nmajor  partners  in  the  TVET  subsector.  Their  support  to  the  Youth  Employment  Promotion \nProgram  since  2008  led  to  the  establishment  of  INDMO  and  the  NQF.  Other  development \npartners in TVET include the European Commission, the Government of Brazil, and the Spanish \nInternational Cooperation. The project builds on previous and ongoing support in TVET and will be \nimplemented in close cooperation with these development partners. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  a  skilled  workforce  in  Timor-Leste  with \nimproved  quality  and  higher  levels  of  vocational  training.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  an \nenhanced TVET system with mid-level skills training (levels 2\u20134) that is relevant and responsive to \nlabor market needs. \n \nC. \n \nThe  project  will  deliver  five  outputs:  (i)  mid-level  skills  training  provision,  (ii)  technical \n13. \nteacher  training,  (iii)  enhanced  labor  market  linkages  of  TVET,  (iv)  strengthened  SEFOPE \nfinancing and support for TVET, and (v) project implementation and management. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nMid-Level Skills Training Provision \n\n \n14. \nThis output will support the provision of training at certificate levels 2\u20134 in construction and \nautomotive  skills  by  (i)  developing  national  skills  standards  and  curricula,  (ii)  improving  technical \nskills of teachers, and (iii) upgrading facilities and equipment of selected training providers to deliver \ncompetency-based training. \n \n15. \nDevelopment  of  industry-based  training  standards  and  curriculum. INDMO has been \ndeveloping competency-based skills standards for levels 1\u20132 in construction and automotive skills \nbased  on  industry  inputs  and  the  established  procedures  of  the  NQF.  The  project  will  support \nINDMO  to  further  develop  level  3\u20134  skills  standards,  including  modular  programs.  Curricula  and \nlearning  materials  will  be  produced  by  adapting  internationally  available  materials  according  to \nTimor-Leste requirements. \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Timor-Leste, 2011\u20132015. Manila; ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business \n\nPlan: Timor-Leste, 2011\u20132013. Manila.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fUpgrading  facilities  and  equipment  of  public  training  provider. The Tibar Training \n16. \nCenter (Tibar) is one of two public training providers and is recognized by INDMO as delivering \nquality  basic  skills  training  in  construction  trades  (mainly  carpentry,  plumbing,  electrical, \nmasonry, and solar energy).10 The project will finance the upgrading of facilities and equipment \nat  Tibar  to  deliver  competency-based  training  at  levels  2\u20134,  and  the  construction  of  dormitory \nfacilities to expand access by students from remote areas and by women. The dormitory facility \nwill also be used to accommodate teachers participating in technical teacher training programs \n(see output 2). \n \nUpgrading  facilities  and  equipment  of  private  training  providers.  The  project  will \n17. \nsupport two registered private (nongovernment) training providers\u2014Dili Institute of Technology (DIT) \nBaucau and Don Bosco at Comoro\u2014with facility and equipment upgrades to deliver mid-level skills \ntraining  in  the  project\u2019s  priority  skill  areas. 11  They  will  be  required  to  enter  into  a  partnership \nagreement  with  SEFOPE  to  take  part  in  the  project.12 The  agreement  will  specify  the  scope  of \nassistance  for  each  training  provider  and  outline  the  rights  and  obligations  of  SEFOPE  and  the \ntraining  providers.  Obligations  of  training  providers  will  include  commitments  to  train  specified \nnumbers  of  trainees  in  mid-level  skills  programs,  and  to  operate  and  maintain  upgraded  facilities \nand equipment. The agreements will ensure that support provided to the private training providers is \npassed  to  trainees  through  the  provision  of  quality  training  at  a  reduced  cost.  A  long-term  plan \nensuring the continued delivery of mid-level skills training by these providers will also be developed \nduring project implementation.13  \n \n\n2. \n\nTechnical Teacher Training \n\n \nThis  output  will  improve  the  technical  and  pedagogical  capacity  of  teachers  from \n18. \nparticipating  training  providers  to  ensure  the  delivery  of  level  2\u20134  training  in  construction  and \nautomotive trades. The project will help SEFOPE establish a new vocational training development \ncenter (VTDC), deliver  in-service training for TVET teaching staff, and develop  long-term plans to \nimprove the skills of TVET teaching staff.  \n \n19. \nEstablishing a vocational training development center. A new VTDC will be established \nat  an  existing  facility  at  Tibar  with  appropriate  equipment  and  staff  to  provide  in-service  training \nprograms for TVET technical teaching staff. The project will also support the development of a long-\nterm  plan  for TVET  teacher  training  programs,  and  an  institutional  plan  for  the  VTDC  outlining  its \nfinancing mechanism and sustainability.  \n \nTraining  of  trainers.  Intensive  in-service  training  at  the  VTDC  will  be  provided  by \n20. \ninternational trainers to TVET teaching staff to upgrade training skills in construction and automotive \ntrades  according  to  approved  certification  standards.  Technical  training  will  be  combined  with  the \nexisting  pedagogical  training  and  training  in  relevant  industry  settings,  which  will  be  offered  as \n\n                                                \n10 Another  public  institution\u2014the  Senai  Training  Center\u2014was  established  with  support  from  the  Government  of \nBrazil, which continues to fund operational expenses except for salaries for trainers.  Since the Senai Center intends to \ncontinue training based on Brazilian certificate standards, it declined to be included in the project. \n\n11 The criteria for selecting private training providers for project support are described in the Selection Criteria and Profiles of \nProject Training Centers (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). There are currently only four private \nvocational  training  providers  that  deliver  basic-level  training  in  construction  and  automotive  skills  outside  the  formal \neducational  system.  Of  these  four  training  providers,  two  did  not  satisfy  selection  criteria,  and  hence  only  the  two \nremaining private training providers are included for project support. \n\n12 The  guidelines  on  the  preparation  of  the  proposed  partnership  agreement  are  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 The long-term plan to be developed will consider public\u2013private partnership frameworks, if appropriate. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fmodular programs. Teachers from the project\u2019s three training providers will form a cadre of master \ntrainers capable of passing on their skills to other technical teachers.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhancing Labor Market Linkages of Technical and Vocational Education \nand Training \n\n \n21. \nPoor perceptions of TVET and lack of information about related career opportunities deter \nmany young people from developing skills relevant to labor market needs. This output will support \nSEFOPE to (i) expand its TVET promotion activities and job counseling services, (ii) facilitate private \nsector employers to provide workplace training or internships, and (iii) improve the LMIS. \n \n22. \nTVET  promotion  and  career  guidance.  To  promote  TVET  and  related  career \nopportunities,  the  project  will  undertake  social  marketing  and  outreach  activities  through \ninformation  materials,  media  campaigns,  and  national  skills  fairs.  The  career  counseling \nservices of SEFOPE will be strengthened to assist TVET trainees with job applications and job \nplacements.  These  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  employers  and  industry  representatives, \nwith special attention to encouraging female participation in nontraditional skills areas. \n \n23.  Workplace  training.  The  project  will  assist  mid-level  skills  training  providers  in \ndeveloping  workplace  training  programs  with  relevant  enterprises.  Contracting  programs  for \nworkplace training will be developed with a fixed payment per student to employers to defray the \ncosts  of  on-the-job  training.  The  programs  will  pay  special  attention  to  the  placement  of  female \ntrainees. The project will also organize workshops to inform and educate private sector employers \non the role of skills training in improving worker productivity and enterprise profitability. \n \n24. \nImproved  LMIS.  The  existing  LMIS  is  confined  to  gathering  supply-side  information  from \njob-seekers  through  district  employment  centers  and  from  trainees  in  registered  TVET  providers. \nThe  project  will  introduce  demand-side  data  through  employer  surveys  and  enterprise  training \nneeds  assessments.  Combined  with  supply-side  data,  the  information  will  yield  indicators  of  skills \nshortages  and  training  needs,  which  will  help  SEFOPE  decide  on  funding  allocations  and  assist \nTVET institutions in designing demand-driven training programs. \n \n\n4. \n\nStrengthening SEFOPE Financing and Support for Technical and \nVocational Education and Training  \n\n \n25. \nThe project will help SEFOPE strengthen the delivery of mid-level skills training and improve \nits capacity in TVET management. It will support SEFOPE to (i) develop financing plans to sustain \nmid-level  skills  delivery  in  public  and  private  training  institutions;  (ii)  design  strategies  to  expand \naccess  to  TVET  by  young  men  and  women,  especially  those  from  poor  and  disadvantaged \nbackgrounds; and (iii) expand the implementation of mid-level skills training. \n \n26. \nThe  government  is  currently  preparing  a  TVET strategic  plan  which,  once  approved,  will \nassist SEFOPE in expanding mid-level skills training. The project will support the expansion, which \nwill  involve  (i)  up-scaling  mid-level  skills  training  with  additional  training  providers  or  programs;  (ii) \nimplementing  scholarship  programs  for  mid-level  skills  trainees,  with  a  targeted  allocation  for \nfemales; and (iii) extending workplace training and placements with employers.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation and Management \n\n \n27. \nThe  project  will  provide  necessary  support  for  the  project  management  unit  (PMU) \nestablished  in  SEFOPE  to  (i)  establish  the  facilities  and  systems  required  for  effective  project \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nimplementation  and  management;  (ii)  develop  and  implement  a  project  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem  for  main  project  outputs  and  the  gender  action  plan;  and  (iii)  effectively  and  efficiently \nmanage  project  activities,  including  procurement,  accounting,  and  regular  reporting  of  project \nprogress.  \n \nD. \n \n28. \nphysical and price contingencies.

A project steering committee will be \nestablished,  consisting  of  the  secretary  of  SEFOPE  (chair),  MOE,  members  of  INDMO  executive \ncommission, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Key development partners in the TVET \nsubsector will participate as observers. The project steering committee will provide overall guidance \nto  the  project  and  ensure  the  integration  of  project  activities  into  overall  TVET  development. \nSEFOPE  will  establish  a  PMU  which  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation, \ncapacity development, planning and budgeting, procurement, disbursement, monitoring, supervising \nimplementation at training provider level, and reporting to the government and ADB. The PMU will \nbe supported by consultants. \n \n31. \nproject administration manual (PAM).15 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nApril 2012\u2013December 2016 \n31 December 2016 \n\nPSC: secretary, SEFOPE (chair); MOE; INDMO; Chamber of Commerce \nand Industry \n(ii) Executing agency \nSEFOPE \n(iii) Key implementing agency  SEFOPE \n(iv) Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\n1 contract \n5 contracts \n\nPMU supported by consultants \n$800,000 \nNCB (work) \n$930,000 \nNCB (equipment and materials) \n$1,205,000 \nShopping (equipment and workshops)  40 contracts \n$1,217,000 \nSSS \n$1,197,000 \nICS \n$200,000 \nCQS \n$394,000 \nQCBS \n$300,000 \nQCBS \n$20,000 \nLCS \nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\n118 person-months \n153 person-months \n388 person-months \n  92 person-months \n2 packages (survey) \n1 package (audit) \n\nConsulting services \n\nDisbursement  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, ICS = individual consultant selection, INDMO \n= National Labor Force Development Institute, LCS = least-cost selection, MOE = Ministry of Education, NCB = national \ncompetitive bidding, PSC = project steering committee, PMU = project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based \nselection, SEFOPE = Secretariat of State for Vocational Training and Employment, SSS = single-source selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n32. \nFor  the  implementation  of  project  activities  in  developing  skills  standards  and  curriculum \nmaterials (output 1) and teacher training (part of output 2), the International Labor Organization will \nbe contracted through single-source selection to ensure the continuity of ongoing efforts to establish \ncompetency-based skills standards under the NQF. \n \n\n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  project  result  mainly  from  the  improved  skills  of  trained \n33. \nworkers and the higher wages they can earn as skilled compared with unskilled workers. While it is \nreasonable to expect that system-wide improvements in quality and reliability of competency-based \ntraining  will  benefit  all  students  in  the  TVET  system,  only  the  wage  earnings  of  graduates  from \nproject-supported programs are quantified as incremental benefits. Project benefits also include the \nestimated  value  of  increased  activity  in  the  local  economy  that  is  expected  from  higher  worker \nearnings and the greater portion of earnings expended in the local economy. Increased numbers of \nTimorese  workers  (rather  than  foreign  workers)  in  high-paying  jobs  spend  more  in  the  local \neconomy  (rather  than  remitting  it  to  home  countries)  and  spur  growth  in  the  local  economy.  The \neconomic  analysis  indicates  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  will  be \n26.6%. 16  This  high  EIRR  reflects  the  acute  shortage  in  Timor-Leste  of  skilled  workers  in  key \nindustries (i.e., construction and transport), which is driven by the country\u2019s rapid growth and rising \ndemand for skilled workers. \n \n34. \nThe financial analysis assessed the sustainability of the project at national and project levels, \nand evaluated the impact of the proposed investment given current and projected TVET subsector \nfunding levels. The analysis concluded that the government has the capacity to absorb and sustain \nthe benefits of the project, but that institutional strengthening of SEFOPE is required. Sustainability \nis supported by the existence of the national SDP emphasizing vocational  skills development and \nthe ongoing development of a TVET strategic plan. \n \nB. \n \n35. \nFinancial management and procurement capacity assessments have been carried out at the \ncountry  and  executing  agency  levels.  While  the  government  has  made  progress  in  developing \ncountry-level  financial  management  systems,  further  improvements  are  required,  particularly  in   \nbudget preparation, execution, accounting, and audit. Procurement regulations have been revised \nseveral  times  in  recent  years,  and  further  improvements  are  being  made.  This  is  the  first  ADB-\nfinanced project  with SEFOPE. The financial management and procurement capacity of SEFOPE \nwas assessed as low. To address this, a PMU will be established within SEFOPE and staffed with \nadequate expertise and consultants to ensure compliance with ADB policies and procedures, and to \nstrengthen  the  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  of  SEFOPE.  All  procurement  will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n36. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith the government and SEFOPE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n16 Details on the calculations of the EIRR estimate are presented in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). The EIRR is estimated by comparing the expected wages of an unskilled worker over a 10-\nyear period to the wages of workers with certified skills supported by the project. A survey of wages at automobile repair \nshops  and  construction  firms  around  Dili  conducted  during  project  preparation  augmented  information  on  wages  from \nTimor-Leste Labor Force Survey 2010 (footnote 4) and provided the basis for wages of workers at different skill levels. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n37. \nDespite rapid economic growth and steady progress in human development indicators, the \npoverty  level  remains  high  at  an  estimated  41%  in  2009.17 The  prevalence  of  poverty  is  closely \nassociated  with  low  human  resource  levels  in  areas  such  as  literacy,  education,  and  productive \nskills.  The  formal  school  system  does  not  equip  students  with  adequate  knowledge  or  practical \nskills, leaving many young people unemployed while many skilled positions in the rapidly expanding \ninfrastructure  construction  are  filled  by  foreign  workers.  The  unemployment  rate  in  urban  areas \nreached  34%  in  2010  for  those  aged  15\u201324  (footnote  3).  The  project  will  contribute  to  skills \ndevelopment for young people by introducing mid-level skills training in construction and automotive \ntrades\u2014areas  that  are  in  great  demand  in  the  labor  market\u2014and  enhance  employment  and \nincome-earning opportunities.  \n \n38. \nGender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. To increase women\u2019s \nenrollment  in  nontraditional  skills  training  and  their  employment  in  infrastructure,  a  gender  action \nplan  (GAP)  has  been  prepared.  The  GAP  focuses  on  increasing  female  enrollment  by  (i)  raising \nawareness  of  nontraditional  TVET  and  related  career  options  through  promotional  activities,  (ii) \nmaking the curriculum more gender sensitive, (iii) providing gender training to TVET management \nand  teaching  staff,  (iv)  constructing  a  dormitory  for  female  trainees  at  Tibar,  (v)  targeting  female \nenrollment of at least 20% in construction and automotive trades by 2016, and (vi) recruiting female \ntrainers  in  skills  areas  covered  by  the  project.  The  GAP  aims  to  place  at  least  80%  of  female \ntrainees  in  workplace  training  programs  and  strengthen  career  counseling  services  by  involving \nbusiness  women  from  nontraditional  sectors.  The  project  will  also  develop  scholarship  programs \ntargeted at females as part of TVET policy implementation plans. \n \nD. \n \n39. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  environment  category  B  and  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). The initial environmental examination found that environmental impacts are minor and can \nbe mitigated. During construction of training and dormitory facilities, excavated materials and solid \nwaste  will  be  managed  in  a  manner  that  does  not  create  any  permanent  environmental  impact. \nDuring operation, the automotive workshop will ensure proper disposal of hazardous waste such as \nengine oil.  \n \n40. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement \nand  indigenous  peoples  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  All  civil  works  on \nconstructing or upgrading training and dormitory facilities will be undertaken on existing land owned \nby respective institutions within their current boundaries. The project is not expected to involve any \nissues of involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. If any unanticipated issues are identified \nduring  implementation,  the  government  will  inform  ADB  and  address  these  issues  according  to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nE. \n \n41.
