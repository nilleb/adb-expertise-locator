THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balakot Hydropower Development Project.1 The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank (AIIB) for the Balakot Hydropower Development Project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the loan. \n \n2.  The project will finance the construction of a 300-megawatt (MW) run-of-river hydropower \nplant on the Kunhar River in Mansehra District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. The project will \n(i) improve energy security by increasing the clean energy share in the country\u2019s energy mix, \nwhich is dominated by thermal power generation; (ii) boost the economy and promote revenue-\ngenerating investments in the hydro-abundant Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province; and (iii) build \ncapacity and awareness on climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation measures.2 The \nproject also targets improving the quality of life of women in communities surrounding the project \narea and promotes gender mainstreaming. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector structure and energy mix. Since 2002, Pakistan has been unbundling and \nrestructuring its energy sector. The Water and Power Development Authority, the sole vertically \nintegrated  entity  previously  controlling  the  entire  sector,  was  unbundled  into  10  regional \ndistribution  companies,  four  government-owned  thermal  power  generation  companies \n(GENCOs), a transmission company, and a centralized agency\u2014the Central Power Purchasing \nAgency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G)\u2014to purchase power from all GENCOs and independent \npower producers (IPPs). Privately owned Karachi Electric Supply Company is responsible for \ngenerating and distributing power in Karachi and is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Nearly \n50% of the country\u2019s total installed capacity is provided by private sectors led IPPs. Pakhtunkhwa \nEnergy Development Organization (PEDO), a fully state-owned entity, is responsible for investing, \ndeveloping, and operating hydropower plants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province using public \nsector financing, as well as acting as a one-window facilitator for private sector investors who \nintend to invest in hydropower projects in the provincial territory and avail of the concessions \nunder  the  KP Hydropower  Policy  2016.3  The  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority \n(NEPRA) was established to determine tariffs, issue licenses, and regulate and ensure the long-\nterm sustainability of the sector. All IPPs, state-owned, and province-owned electricity generation \nunits sell electricity to the CPPA-G, mostly based on take-or-pay power purchase agreements. \n \n4.  In FY2019\u22122020, the total installed capacity in country was about 39 gigawatts (GW)\u2014an \nenergy mix dominated by thermal energy\u2014with almost 60% generated from oil-, gas-, and coal-\nfired power plants, 29% from hydropower and remaining 11% from other sources including solar, \n \n1  Previously called the Hydropower Development Investment Project, the project\u2019s name was revised after the funding \nmodality was changed from a multitranche financing facility to a stand-alone project.

Generation costs were substantially skewed toward oil- and gas fired \npower plants, with 46% of the total cost in FY2017.4 The decade old demand-supply gap has \nbeen curtailed by adding 13 GW of generation capacity (mostly gas-fired or coal-based) to the \nnational  grid  from  2016\u22122020  but  with  projected  demand  growth  of  15  GW  by  2030  and \ndecommission plan of 5 GW of inefficient thermal and diesel plants by 2025, more additions are \nstill required to meet future needs. \n \n5.  Sector issues. Key issues faced by Pakistan\u2019s power sector include (i) recurring circular \ndebt, (ii) an unsustainable and unaffordable energy mix with heavy reliance on imported fuel-\nbased electricity generation, (iii) a stressed transmission and distribution network, and (iv) the \nslow pace of reforms. The government made large investments in transmission, distribution, and \ngeneration from 2009 to 2019, but system stability and reliability have not been fully resolved \nmainly because of cash constraints caused by recurring circular debt and network bottlenecks \ncaused by old infrastructure and growing demand. While further planned investment in the \nnetwork will improve system reliability, sustainability and affordability cannot be achieved unless \nthe key issues that feed the circular debt\u2014to which imported fuel-based generation and the slow \npace of reforms are major contributors\u2014are resolved. This project will contribute to improving the \nenergy mix by increasing the clean energy share and reducing the reliance on imported fuel. A \nthermal-dominant energy mix for a fuel-importing country with weak hedging systems not only \nmakes a country vulnerable to price fluctuations and abnormal tariff increases, but also burdens \nits foreign reserves and exposes it to unnecessary foreign exchange risks. \n \n6.  Other factors contributing to circular debt are weak governance of sector institutions, \ninadequate  cost  recovery  consumer  tariffs,  and  mismatched  subsidies,  which  are  being \naddressed in parallel through a structured reform program prepared by the government with \nsupport from development partners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Through this \nreform program, the sector will (i) secure financial sustainability by controlling accumulation and \naddressing reduction of circular debt; (ii) strengthen governance by rationalizing a competitive \nmarket  road  map,  separating  policy  and  regulatory  functions  in  hydrocarbons,    appointing \nappellate tribunals, implementing multiyear tariffs, and unbundling the gas subsector; and (iii) \nreinforce infrastructure improvements through integrated planning to facilitate public and private \nsector investments across the energy supply chain.5 \n \n7.  Balancing the energy mix has been a challenge for the government mainly because of \nlarge investment needs and the focus on solutions that could be implemented in the shortest \npossible time to address the large demand\u2013supply gap affecting the country since 2007. To some \nextent, this has been effective in reducing the demand\u2013supply gap, but focusing on short-term \nsolutions increased reliance on imported fuel-based power plants, which in turn has made the \nsector less sustainable and affordable. To resolve these issues, the share of clean energy has to \nbe substantially increased. Developing new hydropower plants can play an important role not only \nby  increasing  the  share  of  clean  energy  but  also  by  generating  large  economic  activities \nassociated with the construction of mega projects, such as hydropower plants. Pakistan is rich in \nhydropower resources, but despite 100 GW of recognized and 60 GW of identified hydropower \npotential (30 GW of which are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), only 9,861 MW (16%) have been \nharnessed (5,729 MWs in KP), including 472 MW of hydropower added by private sector. \nPakistan added 2.5 GW of hydropower to its energy mix in 2018, but considering Pakistan\u2019s huge \n \n4  NEPRA. 2020.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nhydropower potential and need for clean energy, its energy mix should be further rationalized and \ncome from more hydropower and other renewable energy sources. \n \n8.  Recognizing the challenges, the government introduced the Power Generation Policy \n2015 to (i) empower the provincial governments to function as facilitators for IPPs, (ii) simplify \ninvestment decision-making by local and federal authorities, (iii) identify zones of responsibility in \nprocessing and implementing generation projects, and (iv) extend the federal government\u2019s \nsupport of backing up the power purchaser payment obligation and political and other risks in the \nprojects to the provincial government-initiated projects when conforming to certain requirements.6 \nIn parallel, the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa issued the KP Hydropower Policy 2016 \n(footnote 3), which assigned PEDO as the single facilitator for all investors in hydropower projects \nin the province and aims to develop projects through the private and public sector windows. \n \n9.  Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization\u2019s hydropower development plan \nand strategy. PEDO has identified several sites and is implementing a strategy to maximize the \nprovince\u2019s hydropower potential. The development of these projects has been directed through \nthe private and public sectors. The private sector feeds into indirect economic growth (increased \nindustrial activities), and the public sector helps increase the government\u2019s revenue by exploiting \nindigenous resources, which provides the provincial government a bigger cushion for social sector \nspending that would otherwise not be possible given the limited provincial potential to generate \nrevenues from other sectors. ADB supported PEDO in developing a 10-year road map for the \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa energy sector. The provincial government approved the road map, including \nan investment plan, on 15 August 2016. The road map identified the need to restructure PEDO \ninto an independent corporate entity that would undertake interventions such as establishing \nmultiple special purpose vehicles for power projects and special facilitation windows for private \nsector investments. The investment plan aims to develop 21 run-of-river hydropower projects with \na total funding requirement of $11 billion. PEDO aims to commercialize the proposed projects, \nallowing private sector participation and encouraging investments by providing incentives and \neasing procedures. Projects with low potential interest from the private sector will be implemented \nusing public sector financing with support from development partners, including this project by \nADB, the World Bank, and the government\u2019s own resources (details are in para. 13). \n \n10.  Rationalizing the generation mix aligns with ADB country partnership strategy, 2021\u22122025 \noutcomes, which prioritize developing domestic energy resources such as hydropower and \nrenewable energy; and promoting greater availability, affordability, and efficiency in the sector. \nThe project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Pakistan.7 It \nsupports (i) ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 by helping reduce remaining \npoverty and inequalities, accelerate progress in gender equality and reduce women\u2019s time \npoverty, tackle climate change, build climate and disaster resilience, enhance environmental \nsustainability, promote rural development, and improve the financial management of PEDO; and \n(ii) Sustainable Development Goals 5, 7 and 13 by providing affordable, clean, and sustainable \nenergy; and meeting Pakistan\u2019s climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives.8  \n \n \n6  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water and Power. 2015.

The Independent Evaluation Department reviewed ADB\u2019s \nenergy  investments  in  Pakistan  since  2005  and  made  two  recommendations  based  on \nexperiences and lessons from ongoing projects: (i) strategic\u2014strengthen support for clean energy \nand conservation by investing in renewable energy generation and energy efficiency; and review \nthe renewable energy policy and associated regulations to increase the share of renewable \nenergy  in  the  mix,  reduce  generation  costs,  and  mitigate  climate  change  impacts;  and \n(ii) operational\u2014promote  sovereign  investments  to  lower  baseload  power  generation  costs, \nbuilding on sound integrated energy planning to increase Pakistan\u2019s energy security by reducing \nits dependency on imported fuels.9 These recommendations have been incorporated in ADB \ninvestment plans. ADB is supporting the first recommendation through the ongoing policy-based \nprogram loan (footnote 5) and the second by focusing sovereign investments on hydropower \ndevelopment, such as in this project. Such projects will lower generation costs and reduce the \nsector\u2019s reliance on imported fuel. The new Alternative and Renewable Energy Policy 2020 \napproved in July 2020 set a target to increase the renewable energy share from 3.40% in 2020 to \n20% by 2025 and 30% by 2030 (footnote 4). In June 2020, the World Bank approved a $500 \nmillion multisector policy-based program-Resilient Institutions for Sustainable Economy (RISE). \nThe  energy  component  of  RISE  supports  Pakistan\u2019s  transition  to  low  carbon  energy  and \ndevelopment  of  indigenous  resources  for  clean  energy  generation  through  deployment  of \nrenewable energy and hydropower sources. \n \n12.  ADB has been engaged with PEDO since 2005 and has not only contributed to PEDO\u2019s \ninvestment needs but also provided extensive support in developing plans, strategies, capacity \nbuilding, improvements in institutional setup, and reforms. ADB supported developing PEDO\u2019s \ncorporatization plan, which the PEDO board of directors approved for implementation. The plan \nincludes strengthening financial systems and creating special purpose vehicles to enhance \ninstitutional efficiency and financial management. Among all development partners, ADB has the \nlongest and most valued relationship with PEDO. With ADB assistance of $44 million, PEDO has \ndeveloped two run-of-river hydropower plants with capacity of 20 MWs to generate 105 gigawatt-\nhours of electricity annually.10 ADB has also provided $237 million to support the provincial \ngovernment\u2019s initiative to provide 2.4 million people and 8,000 schools with reliable access to \nelectricity through innovative business models by engaging communities in  developing and \noperating micro hydel plants (hydropower plants with capacity less than 1,000 kWs).11 These \ninterventions and innovative business models will help Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increase access to \nelectricity by using clean energy resources and engaging communities. \n \n13.  Hydropower investments by other development partners. All major development \npartners  support  hydropower  investments  in  Pakistan.  The  World  Bank  has  the  largest \nhydropower portfolio at $2.2 billion, comprising (i) $725 million in an International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development loan and International Development Association (IDA) credit for \nthe fourth extension of the Tarbela Hydropower Plant (1,410 MW); (ii) $390 million in IDA credit \nfor the fifth extension of the Tarbela Hydropower Plant (1,410 MW), with $300 million cofinancing \nfrom AIIB; (iii) $588 million in IDA credit and $460 million in IDA guarantees for developing the \n2,160 MW Dasu Hydropower Plant; and (iv) $450 million in IDA credit for three hydropower \nschemes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s Upper Dir and Swat districts. The Islamic Development Bank \nprovided $141 million for three medium-sized hydropower plants (323 MW). Similarly, European \n \n9  Independent Evaluation Department. 2019.

The involvement of \nmajor development partners in harnessing Pakistan\u2019s hydropower potential has helped initiate \nmultiple projects, employing both stand-alone and cofinancing options, depending on country \npartnership strategies and institutional priorities. Private sector participation in hydropower-based \ngeneration is expected to increase, with 1,611 MW to be commissioned in 2021\u20132022 and \nanother 4,851 MW planned to be added to the system by 2030. Between 2021 and 2030, the \nprivate  sector  will  add  about  12,478  MW  of  generation  capacity  dominated  by  51.79%  of \nhydropower. \n \n14.  Economy and COVID-19 impact. Pakistan\u2019s episodic pattern of economic growth is \ncharacterized by periods of boom and bust. A narrow production and export base has made the \neconomy less resilient to economic shocks, restricted trade, and resulted in a binding balance-of-\npayments constraint to growth. Domestic resource mobilization is severely limited. A large fiscal \ndeficit, weak external position, and eroded macroeconomic buffers reflect structural weaknesses \nin economic management. Consequently, the fiscal and monetary policy adjustments needed to \ncorrect these economic imbalances are limiting the fiscal space to tackle Pakistan\u2019s infrastructure \ndeficit, raising the cost of doing business for the private sector, and holding back the country\u2019s \ninternational  competitiveness.  Governance  bottlenecks  and  institutional  capacity  challenges \npersist. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth contracted 0.4% in FY2020 as the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic affected consumer demand and private sector activity, leading to \na sharp decline in economic activity. The current account deficit narrowed substantially from 4.8% \nof GDP in FY2019 to 1.1% in FY2020, with exports and imports declining because of the \npandemic. Remittances maintained an upward trend, rising 6.4% in FY2020 despite some \nmonthly volatility from COVID-19 restrictions in the Middle East. The fiscal balance recovered \nfrom a deficit of 9.1% of GDP in FY2019 to 8.1% in FY2020. The Pakistan rupee stabilized at \nabout PRs158 against the United States dollar in FY2020. \n \n15.  The COVID-19 pandemic also delayed advance procurement actions under the project. \nThe bidding period was extended multiple times to accommodate requests from international \nbidders because of lockdowns in multiple countries. The project implementation design includes \ninstructions to contractors on preparing and implementing an effective COVID-19 health and \nsafety plan. In general, the project will positively contribute to boosting the indirect economic \nimpact in the province by generating jobs and construction activities. Once operational, the \nprovince can use the revenues generated from the hydropower plant to improve health and \neducation facilities. \n \n16.  Climate change. Hydropower generation is at the nexus of Pakistan\u2019s climate change \nadaptation and mitigation priorities and objectives. Scaling up large hydropower generation, \nbuilding climate-resilient water-related infrastructure, and enhancing water resource management \nare among the country\u2019s priority climate actions.12 The country is among the most vulnerable to \nclimate change, with water resources and energy particularly at risk from expected increases in \nthe magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and high \ntemperatures.13 Under the Paris Climate Agreement, Pakistan has committed to reduce by 2030 \n \n12 Government of Pakistan. 2016.

Gender impacts of unreliable electricity supply. Women are the primary managers and \nusers of electricity in households. The energy crisis adds to women\u2019s time poverty as it increases \nthe time needed to carry out domestic chores such as cleaning, cooking, and laundry; and reduces \nthe productivity of home-based workers.15 More than 70% of women work in the informal sector \nand are largely associated with small and medium-sized enterprises. From 2017 to 2018, women \ncomprised  62.1%  of  home-based  workers,  and  55%  of  them  are  piece-rate  workers  in \nmanufacturing.16 Unreliable electricity and long power outages adversely affect their productivity \nand livelihood opportunities. Because of their geographic location and hard terrain, the province\u2019s \nnorthern districts are isolated and have lower socioeconomic indicators than the rest of the \nprovince and country. Less reliable energy in the project area further limits women\u2019s opportunities \nto participate in economic activities. Improved and reliable electricity supply will boost economic \nopportunities for the province\u2019s remote communities, particularly for women. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n18.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: carbon footprint reduced; and energy \nsector made more renewable, efficient, and reliable.17 The project will have the following outcome: \nenergy security in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa enhanced.18 A gender-inclusive community development \nprogram  will  be  implemented  to  mitigate  resettlement  impacts  and  build  the  communities\u2019 \nresilience against disasters and economic shocks. \n \n19.  Output 1: Climate-resilient hydropower plant commissioned. A 300 MW hydropower \nplant will be commissioned near Balakot City in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by 2027. Its design will \nincorporate seismic strengthening and climate-proofing measures. The plant will improve the \nenergy mix by adding 1,143 gigawatt-hours of clean energy annually to the system and will \nenhance the sector\u2019s reliability and sustainability, leading to better energy security. A community \ndevelopment program will be implemented to cater to the socioeconomic needs of the affected \ncommunities and the communities surrounding the project area. This will improve the livelihood \nopportunities for the displaced households and adjacent communities, including women and \nvulnerable segments of the population; build economic resilience; and improve their capacity to \ncope with risks, such as health, climate change, natural disasters, and other relevant issues. \n \n20.  Output 2: Capacity for climate change risk management in hydropower production \nenhanced. Awareness will be developed among communities, with specific training for women \nand youth groups to serve as climate change leaders. PEDO staff will be trained to incorporate \nclimate change risk guidelines into hydropower plant operations. \n \n21.  Output  3:  Pakhtunkhwa  Energy  Development  Organization\u2019s  revenues  from \nindigenous resources increased.

This will substantially increase PEDO\u2019s \nrevenue and will help reduce average daily load shedding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \n \n22.  Output 4: Income-earning opportunities and skills for local communities increased. \nDuring construction, the local population will benefit from job opportunities, commercial activities, \nand material supply. The project will generate more than 1,200 skilled and unskilled jobs for male \nand female workers, of which about 40% will be sourced locally. The project design includes \nlivelihood skills development for women, who have limited economic opportunities. \n \n23.  Building on ADB\u2019s experience in the sector since 2005, the project will help strengthen \nPEDO\u2019s strategy to encourage hydropower development in the province. This will contribute to \nattaining an energy mix that will not only increase the share of clean energy but also help lower \nbaseload generation costs. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s value addition comes from the components included in the project design. These \ninclude  (i)  implementing  a  gender-inclusive  community  development  program  to  mitigate \nresettlement impacts and build the communities\u2019 resilience against disasters and economic \nshocks, (ii) considering climate change impacts in the technical design, (iii) adding extra tiers in \nthe review of the technical design to help mitigate some of the major implementation risks, and \n(iv) incorporating necessary reforms to improve the financial management and sustainability of \nPEDO. \n \nD.

The Government of Pakistan has requested a regular loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 27-year term, including \na grace period of 7 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the custom-\ntailored repayment method, the average maturity is 16 years, and the maturity premium payable \nto ADB is 0.10% per year. \n \n27.  The government has also requested a loan not exceeding $280,000,000 from AIIB to help \nfinance the project. The AIIB loan is expected to have a 22-year term, including a grace period of \n7 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with AIIB\u2019s sovereign-backed loan \npricing; a commitment charge of 0.25% per year; a one-time front-end fee of 0.25% charged on \nthe loan principal; and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in the draft loan agreement \nbetween the government and AIIB. ADB will partially administer the AIIB loan. \n \n28.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB and AIIB will jointly finance expenditures \nrelated to the turnkey contract on a cost-sharing basis and the related contingencies and financial \ncharges during implementation.20 ADB will solely finance consulting services. The provincial \ngovernment will finance costs related to taxes and duties, project management, environment and \nsocial mitigation, land acquisition, and a portion of the main turnkey contract. ADB financing will \nnot be used for costs relating to land acquisition. The proceeds of the ADB loan will be relent to \nthe provincial government, and through the provincial government will be made available to PEDO \nfor the purposes of the project. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  300.0  39.7 \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Banka  280.0  37.1 \nGovernment  175.0  23.2 \nTotal  755.0  100.0 \na  Partially administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n29.  Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $747.97 million and climate adaptation is estimated \nto cost $7.03 million. ADB will finance 40% of mitigation and adaptation costs, and AIIB will finance \n37%.21 Mitigation costs comprise the construction of the low-carbon hydropower generation plant \nwith associated infrastructure and capacity building. The project\u2019s carbon dioxide reduction is \nestimated at 572,643 tons per year. Adaptation costs comprise (i) capacity building and the \n \n20 Turnkey contract will be jointly financed by ADB and AIIB. As both the loans will not be made effective at the same \ntime, the ADB loan will be front-loaded and will finance 85% of the turnkey contract, exclusive of taxes and duties. \nOnce the AIIB loan is declared effective, the share of ADB and AIIB financing will be revised based on the remaining \namounts to be financed for the turnkey contract at the date of effectiveness of the AIIB loan.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The  project  executing  agency  will  be  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s  Energy  and  Power \nDepartment. The implementing agency will be PEDO, which will manage procurement and project \nimplementation. PEDO will set up a dedicated project implementation unit (PIU) and be supported \nby project management consultants. Works will be carried out by a turnkey contractor. All \nprocurement to be financed and all consultant services to be recruited under the ADB and AIIB \nloans will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The works \ncontract will be jointly financed by ADB and AIIB. As the AIIB cofinancing will be partially \nadministered by ADB, universal procurement will apply to all contracts except for the project \nmanagement consultant.22 The project is prepared with advance contracting for the turnkey \ncontract and the consulting services. Retroactive financing of up to 20% of the ADB loan amount \nfor eligible expenditures incurred up to 12 months  before the date of loan signing will be \nconsidered subject to project preparedness and the availability of counterpart funds. \n \n31.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n32.  The project was planned in 1995, followed by a feasibility study in 2013. The dam safety \npanel hired under ADB transaction technical assistance in 2017 revealed major concerns about \nthe layout and location. An option analysis and additional investigations were carried out from \n2018 to 2019, and the feasibility study was updated to make it sufficient for the turnkey contract. \nThe area is prone to earthquakes and floods. The parameters for the design, investigations, and \nscenarios for earthquakes, landslides, extreme rains events, and induced flows were analyzed, \nand stability of the selected design was established. The dam break study shows a high potential \nimpact category for population and infrastructure. However, the design incorporates features to \nprevent catastrophic failure. Climate change impacts were considered during the selection of flood \npeak and frequency, sedimentation, and hydropower generation. Flood events will not constitute \na climate change project vulnerability, while flow variations have been considered in hydropower \ngeneration. \n \n33.  The proposed 58-meter gravity concrete dam is significantly shorter and equal or better at \nthe installed capacity of 300 MW than previous options. Overall, the proposed technical solution \nis the most cost-effective. The project planning and feasibility study captured information from the \nongoing  upstream  Suki  Kinari  hydropower  project  and  the  completed  downstream  Patrind \nhydropower project.23 Multistage site investigations, including boreholes, were carried out to firm \nup the design and cost and to reduce the risk. The project implementation period, including testing \nand commissioning, is adequate. The feasibility study adequately described the additional studies \nand measures during design and operation, notably the supplemental geological and geotechnical \ninvestigations for slope stabilization, physical modeling, and three-dimensional modeling for the \nturnkey contract. \n \n34.  The design proposes Francis reaction-type turbines after an analysis of the hydraulic \nvariables  (gross  head,  maximum  and  minimum  net  head,  and  foreseen  outflow)  and  the \ncalculation of the base turbine speed and other parameters for the given installed capacity based \non the hydropower optimization studies. The design also covers the sizing of the main and \nauxiliary  components  of  the  turbine.  A  cavern  type-powerhouse  has  been  proposed  and \ncomprises three vertical shaft synchronous generators coupled to the Francis turbines. The \nproject also includes a 500-kilovolt switchyard and its 1.5 km connecting transmission line. \n \n35.  The technical solutions do not depart from the systems generally used in the hydropower \nstations in Pakistan, and follow the best modern practice in terms of safety. The interconnection \nscheme among the plant, the National Transmission and Despatch Company Limited, and the \nPeshawar Electric Supply Company networks fulfills the planning and/or design criteria as \nrequired by NEPRA\u2019s Grid Code.24 The technical specifications for the design, manufacture, \n \n23 SK Hydro; and ADB. 2011.

Islamabad. \n ", "11 \ninstallation, and commissioning of the electromechanical equipment are well defined. PEDO \noperation and maintenance (O&M) staff are familiar with the proposed design concepts. \n \n36.  In the project area, climate change is expected to decrease total winter and spring \nprecipitation and increase total summer and autumn precipitation relative to historical levels, \nleading to (i) increased total annual generation but decreased peaking generation, (ii) increased \nmagnitude and frequency of flood events, and (iii) increased sediment load (footnote 21). The \nfeasibility study has confirmed that the dam will be designed to withstand higher peak flood events \nand  that  the  project  incorporates  strengthened  climate  change  risk  management  in  plant \noperations, including disaster risk awareness and management, and improved cascade water \nresources management. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n37.  The project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n14.1%, exceeding the hurdle rate of 9.0%, and an economic net present value of PRs46.3 billion.25 \nSensitivity analysis confirmed that the project remains economically viable against the following \nadverse circumstances: (i) a 20% increase in investment costs, (ii) a 20% increase in O&M costs, \nand (iii) a 20% decrease in output. Results indicated that the project EIRR is above ADB\u2019s hurdle \nrate against these adverse shocks, but the EIRR is sensitive to the combined effect of revenue \ndecline and capital cost escalation. \n \n38.  The financial internal rate of return of 5.3% compares favorably with the weighted average \ncost of capital of 3.1%.26 Financial viability is gauged by comparing the revenue and cost streams \nof with- and without-project scenarios. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project\u2019s financial \nviability is robust under adverse circumstances. The financial internal rate of return is based on \nthe estimated average tariff for hydropower generation from similar projects in Pakistan without \nescalation. Although NEPRA will determine the project\u2019s actual tariff based on the engineering, \nprocurement, and construction cost indexed by foreign exchange rate variation, this scenario was \nnot considered in the financial analysis. The economic and financial analyses incorporated \nexpected levels and patterns of precipitation and adaptation costs to ensure that project viability \nis  robust  under  expected  climate  changes  (footnote  21).  PEDO\u2019s  operating  and  financial \nsustainability has been strong, with stable profitability, well-controlled O&M, and a low level of \nindebtedness. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n39.  Circular debt and liquidity are the major risks to sector sustainability in Pakistan. The \ngovernment, in consultation with development partners, embarked on a reform and financial \nsustainability program to address the sector\u2019s fiscal, governance, technical, and policy deficits \n(footnote 5). The program entails strengthening the governance of sector institutions, rationalizing \nprices, reforming tariffs, and reducing subsidies. PEDO is exposed to the same risks as other \nGENCOs but with limited impacts, because (i) PEDO\u2019s liquidity and overall exposure to circular \ndebt is mitigated by the provincial government\u2019s support for the timely reconciliation of payments \nfor electricity produced and supplied to the national grid; (ii) PEDO\u2019s generation is all based on \nhydropower and therefore has no exposure to the fuel supplier\u2019s default; (iii) the CPPA-G settles \nall payments to PEDO within the fiscal year, and no debt is carried forward to the next fiscal year; \nand (iv) for payments delayed beyond 90 days, PEDO regularly receives penalty payments by \n \n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nthe CPPA-G. In the long run, such sector liquidity and payment discipline risks can affect PEDO\u2019s \nfinancial viability. To address these concerns, PEDO\u2019s revenues must be ring-fenced in NEPRA\u2019s \napproved cost recovery tariff settings and enforced contractual terms for payments by the CPPA-\nG. Both mitigation measures have been covenanted in the project\u2019s loan agreement to support \neconomic and financial viability. The feasibility-level tariffs for the project are found to be sufficient \nfor facility maintenance and the sustainable operations for the project life. The project tariff is \nwithin the normal limits for such projects. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n40.  PEDO\u2019s financial management risk is substantial and its financial management capability \nis weak. PEDO\u2019s accounting policies, procedures, and financial reporting have followed federal \naccounting  and  international  accounting  standards.  To  comply  with  its  corporate  mandate, \nPEDO\u2019s accounting and reporting are transitioning from cash to accrual accounting, compliant \nwith the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). PEDO delayed submitting audited \nentity statements for FY2018 and FY2019, which are expected to be completed by March 2021. \nSupported by external consultants, PEDO completed its first IFRS adoption for FY2016 and \nFY2017. PEDO needs to strengthen institutional capacity and staff skills for IFRS reporting, \nfinancial planning, internal audit, and corporate governance. To strengthen its disclosure quality \nand transparency, PEDO prioritized automation of accounts by pilot-testing enterprise resource \nplanning and capacity enhancement measures, such as recruiting an adequate number of \nqualified financial management and accounting staff. Loan covenants have been included to \naddress this concern from ADB\u2019s perspective. \n \n41.  Although PEDO is governed by its board of directors, approval procedures for major \ndecisions still rest with the provincial government. As part of the ongoing reforms and to enhance \nthe corporate governance, a corporatization plan for PEDO has been approved by the board of \ndirectors and is being implemented through actions that include (i) reforming its reporting and \ndisclosures from cash to IFRS-compliant accrual accounting and adopting enterprise resource \nplanning, and (ii) strengthening its oversight capacity and creating independent audit and risk \nmanagement under the supervisory board for operational efficiency control. \n \n42.  PEDO\u2019s capacity for procurement, financial management, and project implementation \nwere assessed and found to be sufficient to manage international procurement and maintain \naccounting systems, financial controls, and audit arrangements. Its financial accounting, auditing \nrules, and internal control systems follow generally accepted international practices. \n \n43.  The overall procurement risk is medium. The procurement of civil works (the turnkey \ncontract) and consulting services financed by the ADB and AIIB loans follows ADB\u2019s Procurement \nPolicy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers. Universal procurement will apply for \nall contracts except for the project management consultant (para. 30). Advance contracting \nactions for the procurement of civil works  (turnkey contract)  used ADB\u2019s standard bidding \ndocuments in open competitive bidding advertised internationally. The executing agency has \ngained experience in the procurement of civil works and consultant recruitment from previous \nADB-funded projects. A strong PIU will be fully established, comprising staff familiar with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Policy.  Procurement  training  will  also  be  provided.  Project  procurement  and \nimplementation will be supported by a team of international consultants. \n \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s Energy and Power Department. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n ", "13 \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n45.  The  poverty,  social,  and  gender  assessment  carried  out  during  project  preparation \nrevealed that a significant proportion of households lives below the estimated national poverty \nline in the project area. One main reason for poverty in the area is the lack of livelihood \nopportunities. Of the total population surveyed for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nand  the  poverty,  social,  and  gender  assessment,  55%  were  employed  and  25%  were \nunemployed. The project area is susceptible to disasters caused by humans or triggered by \nnatural hazards, such as earthquakes and flash floods\u2014the area was hit by two earthquakes in \n2004 and 2005 (footnote 21). This adds to the local communities\u2019 vulnerability to economic \nshocks. To address these issues, a community development program has been developed with \nthe following features: (i) preference for local communities during construction for unskilled, \nsemiskilled, and skilled work; (ii) livelihood skills training programs for local communities; and \n(iii) training programs to improve the local communities\u2019 capacity to cope with climate change and \ndisasters caused by humans or triggered by natural hazards. \n \n46.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A detailed gender action plan \nwas developed based on the findings of the gender assessment.27 Key actions of the gender \naction plan are (i) developing and implementing a gender-mainstreamed community mobilization \nstrategy; (ii) ensuring women\u2019s participation in consultations at all project implementation stages; \n(iii)  developing  and  implementing  a  skills  development  program  for  improving  livelihood \nopportunities, with 50% women\u2019s participation; and (iv) training women and youth groups as \nclimate change leaders to create awareness and sensitize their communities on issues related to \nclimate change and to build resilience against disasters caused by humans or triggered by natural \nhazards. A nongovernment consulting firm will be hired to assist PEDO in developing and \nimplementing the community development program. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n47.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n \n48.  Environment (category A). The EIA and environmental management plan (EMP) have \nbeen prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The EIA includes an assessment of \nenvironmental flows and impacts on aquatic ecology. A critical habitat assessment carried out as \npart of the ecology baseline indicated that the project is in a critical habitat because of the \npresence of valued aquatic biological resources, including endemic fish species. The Kunhar \nRiver is home to the Alwan Snow Trout, a migratory fish species listed as vulnerable in the \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. The project may \nhave significant adverse environmental impacts during construction and operation related to \n(i) loss of the riverine ecosystem because of inundation by the Balakot Reservoir; (ii) degradation \nof the river ecosystem in the low-flow segment downstream of the Balakot dam; (iii) disruption of \nthe water supply for mountain spring users because of alterations to the natural passage of \nsprings caused by blasting for tunnels; and (iv) failure of spoil disposal sites, resulting in increased \nerosion and sediment load entering the river. However, the project is expected to have significant \npositive impacts, including changes in the ecological integrity of the Kunhar River through the \nimplementation of the biodiversity action plan. \n \n \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "14 \n49.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  were  incorporated  in  the  project  design  and  will  be \nimplemented through the EMP, which summarizes the organizational requirements and the \nmanagement and monitoring plans to ensure that PEDO takes the necessary measures to avoid \nadverse effects and maximize the benefits of the project and to operate in conformance with the \napplicable laws and regulations of the provincial government and the Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe  biodiversity  action  plan  was  prepared  to  support  PEDO\u2019s  corporate  commitments  on \nconserving biodiversity and to meet the requirements of the International Finance Corporation \nPerformance Standard 6 and the Safeguard Policy Statement. The environmental management \ncost has been estimated at $8,726,170 during construction and $782,281 per year during \noperation. The project management consultant will monitor the EMP implementation. The PIU will \nestablish an environmental and social management unit, which will ensure that the project is being \nimplemented  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  PEDO\u2019s  environmental  safeguard \ncapacity is low. The PIU and the contractor\u2019s personnel will receive training to maintain awareness \nof the environmental aspects, impacts, and risks associated with the project and corresponding \ncontrols.  PEDO  will  hire  an  external  monitoring  consultant  to  independently  monitor  the \ncontractor\u2019s compliance with environmental and social requirements. The project complies with \nADB\u2019s public disclosure and consultation requirements. Consultations with project stakeholders \nwere undertaken in April\u2212June 2017 and June\u2212July 2018. The draft EIA was disclosed on the \nADB website on 10 December 2018 and the final EIA was disclosed on 15 November 2019. \n \n50.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will require the acquisition of about \n33 hectares of land, affecting about 165 households (887 people) in six villages, according to \nfeasibility study estimates. About 133 households (730 people) will be severely affected and \n129 households will be physically displaced. Additional land may be required for the spoil disposal \nsite. The project will also affect some community and public infrastructure facilities, such as \nschools, health clinics, mosques, local roads, and bridges. \n \n51.  A draft land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared to address these \nimpacts, including rehabilitating the affected community and public infrastructure facilities, based \non preliminary surveys and consultations with the affected households. The draft LARP was \ndisclosed on 29 July 2019. It will be updated during the detailed design phase and notification \n(based on Sections 4 and 5 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894). A livelihood restoration component \nunder the community development program will be developed to help the affected households \nand residents of the affected villages restore and improve their livelihood situation, cope with the \nchanges, and benefit from the project. Working under the PIU, a nongovernment organization \nspecializing in community development and facilitation will be engaged for this purpose. The \nenvironmental  and  social  management  unit  in  the  PIU  will  oversee  LARP  updates  and \nimplementation, with support from the project management consultant and in coordination with \nthe revenue department. An external resettlement monitor will be engaged and confirm LARP \nimplementation. No works will commence until full implementation of the LARP and ADB\u2019s \nacceptance of the external monitor report. \n \n52.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No communities or settlements in the project area are \nconsidered indigenous people.
