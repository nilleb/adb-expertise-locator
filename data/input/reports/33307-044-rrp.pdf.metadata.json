The Noi Bai\u2013Yen Bai section \nis  designed  as  a  four-lane  dual  carriageway  expressway  and  the  Yen  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  section  is \ndesigned  as  a  two-lane  single  carriageway  expressway.  Land  for  an  additional  two  lanes  has \nbeen  acquired  for  future  expansion  to  accommodate  increasing  traffic  demands.  Also,  the \nproject includes delivery of (i) electric, communication, and toll infrastructure, as well as highway \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  equipment  and  vehicles \nfor  Vietnam  Expressway \nCorporation (VEC); (ii) capacity building for VEC on project implementation, corporate financial \nmanagement, highway O&M, and safeguard planning and implementation; and (iii) a program to \nraise awareness of and prevent HIV/AIDS and human and illicit drug trafficking. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  is  an  integral  section  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nEastern Economic Corridor, connecting Kunming in Yunnan Province, PRC with Ha Noi and Hai \nPhong port in Viet Nam. The PRC is the largest trading partner of Viet Nam. Lao Cai is one of \nthe major gateways of Viet Nam for trading with the PRC. The Government of Viet Nam accords \nthe highest priority to the project as one of the main corridor developments for trading with  the \nPRC. In October 2013, at the border in Lao Cai, the international cargo traffic volume was 100 \ntrucks per day from Viet Nam to the PRC, and 150\u2013200 trucks per day in the opposite direction. \nBy constructing the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway, the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor will \nbe completed. The distance from Kunming to Hai Phong will be 813 km after the project, while \nthe distance from Kunming to the nearest ports in the PRC is 1,053 km. International container \ncargo traffic in Kunming could divert to the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor route. The \ncompleted  highway  will  facilitate  trade  with  the  PRC,  support  economic growth in the northern \nmountains of Viet Nam, and expand business opportunities in that area. \n \n4. \nThe  existing  national  roads  between  Noi  Bai  and  Lao  Cai  are  narrow,  with  a  large \nnumber  of  bridges  with  limited  capacity.  Poverty  in  the  project  area  is  largely  a  result  of \ninadequate  access  to  economic  opportunities,  education,  and  health  services  caused  by  poor \nlocal road infrastructure. The volume of domestic cargo along the Ha Noi\u2013Lao Cai route is not \nhigh  at  present. Transportation  companies  in Viet  Nam  use  small  and  medium-sized  trucks  or \nthe  railway,  because  the  existing  national  highways  are  not  safe  for  large  trucks.  With \ncompletion of the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway, they will be allowed to use large trucks to save fuel \ncosts  and  travel  time,  and  reduce  the  risk  of  traffic  accidents.  There  is  substantial  ribbon \ndevelopment  along  most  of  their  length.  The  highway  will  reduce  the  cost  of  travel,  which  will \nencourage  economic  growth  in  the  project  area,  provide  employment  for  the  local  population, \nand improve access to social services.  \n \n\n                                                \n1 The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n As for passenger traffic, it is estimated that 2,500\u20133,000 people are traveling on the Ha \n5. \nNoi\u2013Lao  Cai  route  by  bus  every  day.  The  fare  between  Ha  Noi  and  Lao  Cai  is  D180,000  per \npassenger.  The  travel  takes  8\u201310  hours.  Most  passengers  are  people from  the  project  areas. \nBus companies are willing to start bus services on the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway. As the travel \ntime  will  be  shorter,  the  fare  can  be  reduced.  To  facilitate  access  to  bus  services,  VEC  is \nestablishing  bus  stops  near  residential  areas,  which  will  benefit  local  people  who  do  not  own \ncars  and  thereby  help  meet  the  project\u2019s  objective  of  poverty  reduction.  Bus  companies  also \nexpect that the highway will reduce the risk of traffic accidents. \n \n6. \nThe  project  was  approved  on  14  December  2007,  and  became  effective  on  9  March \n2009  with  financing  $896.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  $200.0 \nmillion  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources. 2  Eight  civil  works  contracts  were \nawarded between 24 March 2009 and 6 April 2010. The total value of the civil works contracts, \nincluding  taxes and contingencies,  is  $840.2  million  equivalent.  The  civil  works  progress  as of \n30  September  2014  is  97%.  Cumulative  loan  disbursement  under  the  civil  works  contracts \nreached $739.6 million as of 3 October 2014. VEC\u2019s capacity in terms of project management, \nsocial  and  environmental  safeguards,  and  financial  management  has  been  enhanced  through \nproject  implementation. The  awareness  and  prevention  program  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human  and \nillicit drug trafficking has been completed. \n \nThe project is expected to meet its outcome, but the overall performance of the project \n7. \nhas  been  below  satisfactory  with  the  following  aspects.3 The  project  implementation  has  been \ndelayed by 3 years, compared to the original project implementation schedule. There has been \na period of unsatisfactory compliance with certain social and environmental loan covenants. For \nexample,  payment  of  compensation  and  allowance  to  project-affected  peoples  was  delayed, \nand income restoration programs for  severely  affected  and vulnerable households were  not  in \nplace when the civil works started. Also, VEC faced a financial risk in 2011 when it was unable \nto  meet  the  covenanted  financial  targets  in  terms  of  its  debt-to-equity  ratio  and  debt  service \ncoverage  ratio.  As  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s  repeated  requests  and  assistance,  those  unsatisfactory \ncompliance issues have been fully resolved. The overall performance of the project is rated \u2018on \ntrack\u2019 for the third quarter of 2014. \n \nAs  a  result  of  continued  price  escalation  since  2009  and  changes  to  detailed  designs, \n8. \ncivil  works  costs  are  now  estimated  to  exceed  the  total  contract  value  by  $191.0  million.  The \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  additional  financing  to  cover  the  cost \noverrun and complete construction of the highway. An alternative option would be to reduce the \nproject  scope  by  terminating  the  civil  works  contracts  in  Yen  Bai  and  Lao  Cai  provinces,  and \nusing the remaining loan funds to complete the civil works contracts in Ha Noi, Vinh Phuc, and \nPhu  Tho  provinces.  However,  this  option  would  result  in  a  deadweight  loss.  An  incomplete \nhighway would not generate any economic benefit for road users and the affected people in Yen \nBai and Lao Cai provinces, who already moved to the relocation sites. Furthermore, completion \nof the remaining sections could only be achieved at a significantly higher cost given the need to \nre-tender the civil works contracts, and completion of the highway would likely be delayed by 2 \nyears or more.    \n \n \n\n                                                \n2 ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  to  the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Kunming\u2013Hai  Phong  Transport  Corridor\u2014Noi \nBai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project. Manila. \n3 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fWith  the  additional  financing,  the  project  remains  (i)  technically  feasible,  economically \n9. \nviable,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  of  high  priority  to  the  government;  (iii)  consistent  with  the \nproject\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv) consistent  with  the  current  country  partnership \nstrategy. The project meets the criteria for additional financing. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  and  outcome  statements  and  indicators  remain  unchanged  under  the \nadditional financing. The expected impact from the project will be sustainable economic growth \nand  strengthened  connectivity  with  the  PRC  in  the  project  area  and  along  the  Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong Transport Corridor. The expected outcome will be international and local traffic using an \nefficient, safe, and reliable express route from Noi Bai to Lao Cai on the border with the PRC.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n11. \nThe  additional  financing  is  needed  to  cover  the  project  cost  overruns.  The  original \noutputs of the project\u2014(i) the 244 km Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway with requisite facilities and O&M \nequipment,  (ii)  strengthening  of  VEC\u2019s  institutional  and  financial  management  capacity,  and \n(iii) a program to raise awareness of and prevent HIV/AIDS and human and illicit drug trafficking \nto minimize the local population\u2019s exposure\u2014remain unchanged.  \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe original cost estimate was $1,216.0 million (Table 1). As a result of higher costs of \ncivil  works,  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR),  the  project  is  now  estimated  to  cost \n$1,441.7 million. To respond to the cost increase, ADB reallocated $112.5 million in contingency \nand  $135.0  million  in  financing  charges  to  the  base  cost  under  the  original  loans.  Also,  the \ngovernment  and  VEC  increased  counterpart  funds  by  $47.4  million  to  pay  for  the  higher  LAR \ncosts  and  financing  charges  for  project  bonds  issued  to  secure  the  counterpart  funds. \nNonetheless, additional financing of $182.0 million is required to complete the project.  \n \n13. \nThe government has requested an additional loan of $117.0 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to \nhelp finance the project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period of 7 years, \nstraight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on \nthis,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  18.75  years,  and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is \n0.20%  per  annum.  Also,  the  government  has  requested  a  regular  term  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR10,870,000 ($16.09 million equivalent) a hard term loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR9,405,000  ($13.91  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to  help finance the  project. These  loans  will  have a 25-year  term,  including  a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such other terms and conditions  as \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government provides counterpart funds \nof $35.0 million equivalent for the project. \n \n14. \nDetailed cost estimates for the additional financing by expenditure category and detailed \ncost estimates by financier are included in the project administration manual.4 ADB\u2019s additional \nloans will finance  the  whole cost  overruns  of  the civil  works  contracts,  including  all  local  taxes \n\n                                                \n4 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nand duties imposed  on  these,  and  may  also finance  local transportation and insurance costs.5 \nAll financing charges are to be capitalized. Local taxes on the civil works and highway facilities \nare estimated at 12% of the base cost, consisting of 10% value-added taxes and 2% duties. In \nall,  local  taxes  are  estimated  at  $12.0 million  equivalent.

The tax percentage was not an excessive share of the project investment \nplan. Counterpart funds should best be allocated for land acquisition and resettlement, and mine clearance works, as \nthese activities needed to start before loan effectiveness. As the counterpart funding was $120 million (about 10% of \nthe  total project  cost), all  of  which  was  required  for  the land  acquisition  and  resettlement activities,  ADB\u2019s  financing \nshould cover all of the local taxes on the remaining ADB-financed project components. \n\nb  Includes taxes and duties of $101.6 million to be financed from ADB loan resources.

The original \nloans  will  be  closed  when  the  loan  funds  are  fully  disbursed  for  the  project.  The  project  cost \noverrun will be financed from the additional loans. The project management unit will continue to \nimplement  the  project  under  the  additional  financing.  Procurement  and  consultant  recruitment \nrequired  for  the  project  have  been  completed,  and  there  is  no  procurement  or  consultant \nrecruitment planned under the additional financing.   \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \n\nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nRetroactive financing \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2015\u2013December 2015 \nProject completion is expected on 31 December 2015.

Almost  all  roads  to  be  connected  by  the  interchanges  are  well  maintained.  However,  a \nfew  connecting  roads  are  narrow  and  in  poor  condition.  The  local  governments  are  widening \nand rehabilitating the connecting roads  so that most  of these works  may  be  completed  by  the \ntime the highway opens. \n \n19. \n VEC established an O&M department headed by the deputy general director on 1 April \n2013  and  assigned  10  staff  to  it.  The  project  supervision  consultant  has  prepared  an  O&M \nmanual.  The  department  has  outsourced  all  O&M  works  for  VEC\u2019s  expressways  to  VEC \nOperation and Maintenance Company. The consulting services financed by Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  under  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway \nConstruction Project provided short-term training for the O&M staff. \n \n20. \nAs  local  residents  along  the  highway  may  not  be  familiar  with  access-controlled \noperation of the highway, VEC is working with the police, mass media, and local governments to \ncarry  out  road  safety  awareness  campaigns.  No  motorcycles,  bicycles,  and  pedestrians  are \nallowed to enter the right-of-way of the highway. To secure mobility of the local residents, VEC \nis improving frontage roads in coordination with the provincial departments of transport. \n \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nTraffic demand for the highway was reassessed, and the project\u2019s economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) including the additional financing was estimated by comparing the major road \nnetworks in northern Viet Nam with and without the project in the same methodology that was \nused at project appraisal.6 The project economic costs include (i) capital costs and resettlement \ncosts,  excluding  tax  and  price  contingency;  and  (ii)  the  highway\u2019s  O&M  cost.  The  project\u2019s \neconomic benefits are lower vehicle operating costs and shorter passenger travel times, which \nwill  benefit  both  the  highway  users  and  traffic  on  the  existing  roads.  The  EIRR  estimated  at \nappraisal for the original loans in 2007 was 18.1% under a toll rate of D1,000/km for passenger \ncars.  The  government  determined  to  set  the  toll  rate  for  the  highway  at  D1,500/km  for \npassenger cars. The estimated EIRR for the project with additional financing under the toll rate \nof  D1,500/km  is  36.6%,  indicating  that  the  project  is  economically  viable.  The  EIRR  for  the \nproject  with  additional  financing  is  higher  than  that  at  project  appraisal  in  2007,  due  to  high \nvehicle  operating  costs  and  time  savings  as  nonincremental  benefits.  For  the  time  savings  in \nparticular, estimates of the passenger time cost was based on the national average wage, which \nhas more than doubled since 2007 in real terms. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of \nthe project\u2019s economic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 10% increase in O&M \ncosts and a 10% reduction in benefits, do not impact the economic viability.   \n \nThe estimated financial internal rate of return of the project with the additional financing \n22. \nis 4.65% at a toll rate of D1,500/km, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \nestimated at 1.08%.7 The financial net present value of the project with the additional financing \nis $1,065.6 million. The results of the financial cost\u2013benefit analysis show that the  project with \nthe additional financing is financially viable. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the \nimpact  of  adverse  changes  in  key  project  variables  on  the  financial  viability.  The  sensitivity \nscenarios  include  a  10%  increase  in  outstanding  capital  expenditures,  a  10%  increase  in \noperating costs, and a 10% decrease in revenue. The results from the sensitivity analysis show \nthat the project remains financially viable in each tested scenario, with financial internal rates of \nreturn ranging  from  3.70%  to  4.65%.  Financial  net  present  values  are  still  satisfactory  against \nthe downside risks. An analysis of financial projections, financial statements, and key financial \nperformance indicators for VEC reveal that VEC will have adequate financial capacity to ensure \nthe  sustainability  of  the  project.  Overall,  the  results  of  the  financial  analysis  indicate  that \nrevenues  to  be  generated  by  the  project  are  likely  to  be  more  than  sufficient  to  cover  O&M \ncosts.  \n\nC. \n\n \nGovernance \n\n23. \nA financial management assessment of VEC concludes that VEC has sufficient financial \nmanagement  capacity  and  adequate  financial  management  arrangements  in  place  for  project \nimplementation.  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and VEC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. \n \n25. \nIn 2011, ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity undertook a review of the project\u2019s \nprocurement procedures, internal controls, disbursements, and financial management system in \n\n                                                \n6 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nconsultation  with  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  (SERD).  It  also  conducted  an  asset \ninspection. The procurement review report, published in October 2012, identified issues in two \nareas:  procurement  and  asset  inspection.8 In  procurement,  the  key  findings  were  (i)  a  lack  of \ndue  diligence  during  prequalification  of  contractors  and  evaluation  of  bids,  (ii)  changes  in  bid \nevaluation  criteria  without  ADB  approval,  (iii)  flawed  evaluation  of  bidders\u2019  cash  flow,  (iv) \ninsufficient basis in assessing compliance with bid requirements,9 and (v) inaccurate evaluation \nin selecting consultants.  Through an  asset  inspection, the review  concluded  that  the  delays  in \nproject  implementation  were  caused  by  contractors\u2019  insufficient  financial  capacity,  which  may \nhave resulted from the irregularities in procurement, and site clearance and resettlement issues. \nOn one contract, the review found that the winning bidder did not have the required cash flow \ncapacity as originally approved by ADB. Nevertheless, the contractor was selected as a result of \nmodifications to the cash flow capacity criterion made by VEC after prequalification and before \nbidding  without  ADB  approval. 10 The  procurement  review  recommended  that  ADB  consider \ndeclaring  misprocurement  or  intensify  oversight  to  ensure  that  the  contractor  successfully \ndelivers the desired output for the contract.  \n \n26.   While  the  procurement  review  was under  way  in late  2011  and  up to  mid-2012, review \nmissions  by  SERD  discussed  the  findings  with  VEC,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  possible \nmisprocurement case (footnote 3). After the issuance of the final procurement review report in \nOctober  2012,  SERD  fielded  another  mission  in November  2012  that  came  up  with  actions  to \naddress  the  report\u2019s  recommendations.  In  considering  the  recommendation  to  declare \nmisprocurement  or  intensify  ADB's  oversight,  SERD  felt  that  the  latter  was  the  preferred \napproach for the following reasons: (i) the change to the criterion was made before bidding and \nall invited bids were evaluated based on the same modified criterion; (ii) the use of the original \ncriterion, which looked at bidder's working capital, had been discontinued, and by applying the \nnew standardized cash flow capacity criterion adopted bank-wide in August 2012,11 the winning \nbidder  was found to have sufficient  cash flow  capacity  to  carry  out the  works; (iii)  the  contract \nwon  by  the  winning  bidder  was  by  then  in  its  third  year,  and  while  delay  was  observed  at  the \ntime  of  procurement  review,  the  performance  of  the  contractor  was  improving; 12  and  (iv) \ndeclaring misprocurement would lead to termination of the current contract by VEC, which could \ninvite  contractual  disputes  between  the  contractor  and  VEC.  Considering  these  factors,  in \nNovember  2012,  SERD  opted  to  permit  the  current  contractor  to  continue  implementing  the \nremaining  contractual  works  rather  than  declaring  misprocurement.  SERD  also  committed \nresources  to  closely  oversee  VEC\u2019s  contract  management  under  all  ongoing  contracts  and \nensure  that  the  loan  proceeds  would  be  properly  utilized.  In  2013\u20132014,  quarterly  review \nmissions  (instead  of  the  normal  biannual  missions)  were  fielded.  Viet  Nam  Resident  Mission \nstaff have also been involved in the continual monitoring of the project.  \n \n\n                                                \n8 ADB.  2012.

Manila.  \n9 Key findings are elaborated in paras. 51\u201355 of footnote 8. \n10 The  ADB-approved  bidding  document  had  the  following  cash  flow  capacity  criterion  for  this  package:  [(working \ncapital + lines of credit) \u2013 current contract commitments] \u2265 $20 million in 4.5 months. VEC modified this and added \n\u201cor lines of credit \u2265 $20 million in 4.5 months.\u201d Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. \nWith  these  modifications,  the  winning  bidder,  on  account  of  its  lines  of  credit  of  $40  million,  qualified  despite  its \nnegative working capital, which would have disqualified the contractor had the ADB-approved original criterion been \nused. \n11 ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  document  was  revised  in  August  2012  and  contains  a  streamlined  method  to  assess \ncontractors\u2019 cash flow capacity.  \n12 By  November 2012,  the  contractor  had  achieved  a physical  progress  ratio  of  30.4%.  The  work  was  substantially \ncompleted in June 2014, and the Highway was opened to traffic. \n\n \n\n\fIn parallel, SERD dedicated more resources to (i) strengthen the review of procurement \n27. \nand consultant recruitment under other ADB-funded projects involving VEC, and (ii) increase the \nprocurement  and  anticorruption  capacity  of  the  Viet  Nam  transport  sector  executing  agencies \nthat  receive  large  volumes  of  ADB  assistance.  The  capacity  building  would  be  implemented \nthrough  structured  training  and collaboration  between  the  Viet  Nam  Resident  Mission  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s integrity and anticorruption body, with support from ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption \nand Integrity.   \n \nTo safeguard the proposed additional financing, ADB will continue to exercise enhanced \n28.  \ndue  diligence  of  contract  management  actions  and  on-site  work  by  reviewing  all  contractual \nchanges  and  adjustments  in  advance,  and  by  fielding  frequent  review  missions  involving  staff \nwith  contract  management  expertise.  A  project  completion  report  with  an  expanded  scope  will \nbe  prepared  to  provide  details  on  how  the  procurement  review  recommendations  have  been \nimplemented. \n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n29. \nThe  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  envisaged  at  the  time  of  the  original  project \nimplementation  remains  unchanged.13 Social  impacts  and  risks  on  the  communities  in general \nand  the  households  physically  and  economically  affected  by  the  project  were  satisfactorily \nmitigated by providing employment for the civil works. The income restoration programs, which \nwere  provided  the  severely  affected  and  vulnerable  households  with  training  and  livelihood \ninputs, resulted to increase in their income. The gender aspects of the project are mainstreamed \ninto the resettlement and income restoration activities, job opportunities during construction, and \nthe  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program.  These  activities  are \nbeing managed and monitored by the project. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nThe additional financing is provided to bridge  cost overruns of the civil  works contracts \nwithin  the  existing  project\u2019s  scale  and  scope.  There  is  no  additional  work  on  safeguards.  It  is \nclassified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n\nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe  cost  overruns  under  the  original  loans  may  occur  before  the  additional  loans \nbecome  effective.  VEC  will  then  finance  the  cost  overruns  from  the  state  budget.  ADB  will \nretroactively  finance  the  cost  overruns  for  up  to  20%  of  the  additional  loan  amount  after  the \nadditional loans become effective.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n32. \nThe  government  and  VEC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n33. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n\nThe government  and  VEC  have agreed with ADB  on  certain covenants for  the  project, \n\n                                                \n13 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n34. \nThe disbursement of the loans is conditional upon the government\u2019s certification that the \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  government  and  VEC  shall  have  been  duly  executed \nand delivered, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness are fulfilled. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n35. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\nthe loan of $117,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the additional \nfinancing  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Kunming\u2013Hai  Phong  Transport \nCorridor\u2014Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;
