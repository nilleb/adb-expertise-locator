THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor\u2014Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project.1 \n \n2.  The Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project involves construction of a 244-kilometer (km) \ngrade-separated and access-controlled highway, including 10 interchanges with toll booths and \nfive service areas, starting at Noi Bai in a suburb of Ha Noi and ending at Lao Cai, on the border \nwith the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in northwest Viet Nam. The Noi Bai\u2013Yen Bai section \nis designed as a four-lane dual carriageway expressway and the Yen Bai\u2013Lao Cai section is \ndesigned as a two-lane single carriageway expressway. Land for an additional two lanes has \nbeen  acquired for future  expansion  to  accommodate  increasing traffic  demands.  Also,  the \nproject includes delivery of (i) electric, communication, and toll infrastructure, as well as highway \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  equipment  and  vehicles  for  Vietnam  Expressway \nCorporation (VEC); (ii) capacity building for VEC on project implementation, corporate financial \nmanagement, highway O&M, and safeguard planning and implementation; and (iii) a program to \nraise awareness of and prevent HIV/AIDS and human and illicit drug trafficking. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway is an integral section of the Greater Mekong Subregion \nEastern Economic Corridor, connecting Kunming in Yunnan Province, PRC with Ha Noi and Hai \nPhong port in Viet Nam. The PRC is the largest trading partner of Viet Nam. Lao Cai is one of \nthe major gateways of Viet Nam for trading with the PRC. The Government of Viet Nam accords \nthe highest priority to the project as one of the main corridor developments for trading with the \nPRC. In October 2013, at the border in Lao Cai, the international cargo traffic volume was 100 \ntrucks per day from Viet Nam to the PRC, and 150\u2013200 trucks per day in the opposite direction. \nBy constructing the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway, the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor will \nbe completed. The distance from Kunming to Hai Phong will be 813 km after the project, while \nthe distance from Kunming to the nearest ports in the PRC is 1,053 km. International container \ncargo traffic in Kunming could divert to the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor route. The \ncompleted highway will facilitate trade with the PRC, support economic growth in the northern \nmountains of Viet Nam, and expand business opportunities in that area. \n \n4.  The existing national roads between Noi Bai and Lao Cai are narrow, with a large \nnumber  of  bridges  with  limited  capacity.  Poverty  in  the  project  area  is  largely  a  result  of \ninadequate access to economic opportunities, education, and health services caused by poor \nlocal road infrastructure. The volume of domestic cargo along the Ha Noi\u2013Lao Cai route is not \nhigh at present. Transportation companies in Viet Nam use small and medium-sized trucks or \nthe  railway,  because  the  existing  national  highways  are  not  safe  for  large  trucks.  With \ncompletion of the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway, they will be allowed to use large trucks to save fuel \ncosts and travel time, and reduce the risk of traffic accidents. There is substantial ribbon \ndevelopment along most of their length. The highway will reduce the cost of travel, which will \nencourage economic growth in the project area, provide employment for the local population, \nand improve access to social services.  \n \n                                                \n1 The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2   \n5.   As for passenger traffic, it is estimated that 2,500\u20133,000 people are traveling on the Ha \nNoi\u2013Lao Cai route by bus every day. The fare between Ha Noi and Lao Cai is D180,000 per \npassenger. The travel takes 8\u201310 hours. Most passengers are people from the project areas. \nBus companies are willing to start bus services on the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway. As the travel \ntime will be shorter, the fare can be reduced. To facilitate access to bus services, VEC is \nestablishing bus stops near residential areas, which will benefit local people who do not own \ncars and thereby help meet the project\u2019s objective of poverty reduction. Bus companies also \nexpect that the highway will reduce the risk of traffic accidents. \n \n6.  The project was approved on 14 December 2007, and became effective on 9 March \n2009 with financing $896.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and $200.0 \nmillion  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.2 Eight  civil  works  contracts  were \nawarded between 24 March 2009 and 6 April 2010. The total value of the civil works contracts, \nincluding taxes and contingencies, is $840.2 million equivalent. The civil works progress as of \n30 September 2014 is 97%. Cumulative loan disbursement under the civil works contracts \nreached $739.6 million as of 3 October 2014. VEC\u2019s capacity in terms of project management, \nsocial and environmental safeguards, and financial management has been enhanced through \nproject implementation. The awareness and prevention program on HIV/AIDS and human and \nillicit drug trafficking has been completed. \n \n7.  The project is expected to meet its outcome, but the overall performance of the project \nhas been below satisfactory with the following aspects.3 The project implementation has been \ndelayed by 3 years, compared to the original project implementation schedule. There has been \na period of unsatisfactory compliance with certain social and environmental loan covenants. For \nexample, payment of compensation and allowance to project-affected peoples was delayed, \nand income restoration programs for severely affected and vulnerable households were not in \nplace when the civil works started. Also, VEC faced a financial risk in 2011 when it was unable \nto meet the covenanted financial targets in terms of its debt-to-equity ratio and debt service \ncoverage ratio. As a result of ADB\u2019s repeated requests and assistance, those unsatisfactory \ncompliance issues have been fully resolved. The overall performance of the project is rated \u2018on \ntrack\u2019 for the third quarter of 2014. \n \n8.  As a result of continued price escalation since 2009 and changes to detailed designs, \ncivil works costs are now estimated to exceed the total contract value by $191.0 million. The \nGovernment of Viet Nam has requested ADB to provide additional financing to cover the cost \noverrun and complete construction of the highway. An alternative option would be to reduce the \nproject scope by terminating the civil works contracts in Yen Bai and Lao Cai provinces, and \nusing the remaining loan funds to complete the civil works contracts in Ha Noi, Vinh Phuc, and \nPhu Tho provinces. However, this option would result in a deadweight loss. An incomplete \nhighway would not generate any economic benefit for road users and the affected people in Yen \nBai and Lao Cai provinces, who already moved to the relocation sites. Furthermore, completion \nof the remaining sections could only be achieved at a significantly higher cost given the need to \nre-tender the civil works contracts, and completion of the highway would likely be delayed by 2 \nyears or more.    \n \n \n                                                \n2 ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n3 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n9.  With the additional financing, the project remains (i) technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) of high priority to the government; (iii) consistent with the \nproject\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv) consistent  with  the  current  country  partnership \nstrategy. The project meets the criteria for additional financing. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  and  outcome  statements  and  indicators  remain  unchanged  under  the \nadditional financing. The expected impact from the project will be sustainable economic growth \nand strengthened connectivity with the PRC in the project area and along the Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong Transport Corridor. The expected outcome will be international and local traffic using an \nefficient, safe, and reliable express route from Noi Bai to Lao Cai on the border with the PRC.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The  additional financing  is  needed  to  cover  the  project  cost  overruns. The  original \noutputs of the project\u2014(i) the 244 km Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway with requisite facilities and O&M \nequipment, (ii) strengthening of VEC\u2019s institutional and financial management capacity, and \n(iii) a program to raise awareness of and prevent HIV/AIDS and human and illicit drug trafficking \nto minimize the local population\u2019s exposure\u2014remain unchanged.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n12.  The original cost estimate was $1,216.0 million (Table 1). As a result of higher costs of \ncivil works, and land acquisition and resettlement (LAR), the project is now estimated to cost \n$1,441.7 million. To respond to the cost increase, ADB reallocated $112.5 million in contingency \nand $135.0 million in financing charges to the base cost under the original loans. Also, the \ngovernment and VEC increased counterpart funds by $47.4 million to pay for the higher LAR \ncosts  and  financing  charges  for  project  bonds  issued  to  secure  the  counterpart  funds. \nNonetheless, additional financing of $182.0 million is required to complete the project.  \n \n13.  The government has requested an additional loan of $117.0 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to \nhelp finance the project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period of 7 years, \nstraight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on \nthis, the average loan maturity is 18.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is \n0.20%  per  annum.  Also,  the  government  has  requested  a  regular  term  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR10,870,000 ($16.09 million equivalent) a hard term loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR9,405,000 ($13.91 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the project. These loans will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government provides counterpart funds \nof $35.0 million equivalent for the project. \n \n14.  Detailed cost estimates for the additional financing by expenditure category and detailed \ncost estimates by financier are included in the project administration manual.4 ADB\u2019s additional \nloans will finance the whole cost overruns of the civil works contracts, including all local taxes \n                                                \n4 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \nand duties imposed on these, and may also finance local transportation and insurance costs.5 \nAll financing charges are to be capitalized. Local taxes on the civil works and highway facilities \nare estimated at 12% of the base cost, consisting of 10% value-added taxes and 2% duties. In \nall,  local  taxes  are  estimated  at  $12.0 million  equivalent.  The  government\u2019s  additional \ncounterpart funds will finance the cost for the highway facilities and the additional LAR costs. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nOriginal  Current  Additional \nItem    Amounta  Amountb  Financingc  Total \n \nA.

The tax percentage was not an excessive share of the project investment \nplan. Counterpart funds should best be allocated for land acquisition and resettlement, and mine clearance works, as \nthese activities needed to start before loan effectiveness. As the counterpart funding was $120 million (about 10% of \nthe total project cost), all of which was required for the land acquisition and resettlement activities, ADB\u2019s financing \nshould cover all of the local taxes on the remaining ADB-financed project components. \nb  Includes taxes and duties of $101.6 million to be financed from ADB loan resources.

VEC has established the Noi \nBai\u2013Lao  Cai  Expressway  project  management  unit  to  manage  day-to-day  project \nimplementation,  and  coordinate  with  the  people\u2019s  committees  of  provinces  affected  by  the \nproject\u2014Ha  Noi  City,  and  Vinh  Phuc,  Phu  Tho,  Yen  Bai,  and  Lao  Cai  provinces\u2014in \nimplementing LAR activities and income restoration programs.   \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements for the proposed additional financing are summarized \nin Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (footnote 4). The original \nloans will be closed when the loan funds are fully disbursed for the project. The project cost \noverrun will be financed from the additional loans. The project management unit will continue to \nimplement the project under the additional financing. Procurement and consultant recruitment \nrequired for the  project  have  been  completed,  and  there  is  no  procurement  or  consultant \nrecruitment planned under the additional financing.   \n \n ", "6   \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2015\u2013December 2015 \nEstimated completion date  Project completion is expected on 31 December 2015.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n18.   The entire highway with 10 interchanges will be open to public traffic at the beginning of \n2015. Almost all roads to be connected by the interchanges are well maintained. However, a \nfew connecting roads are narrow and in poor condition. The local governments are widening \nand rehabilitating the connecting roads so that most of these works may be completed by the \ntime the highway opens. \n \n19.   VEC established an O&M department headed by the deputy general director on 1 April \n2013 and assigned 10 staff to it. The project supervision consultant has prepared an O&M \nmanual.  The  department  has  outsourced  all  O&M  works  for  VEC\u2019s  expressways  to  VEC \nOperation and Maintenance Company. The consulting services financed by Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  under  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway \nConstruction Project provided short-term training for the O&M staff. \n \n20.  As  local  residents  along  the  highway  may  not  be  familiar  with  access-controlled \noperation of the highway, VEC is working with the police, mass media, and local governments to \ncarry out road safety awareness campaigns. No motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians are \nallowed to enter the right-of-way of the highway. To secure mobility of the local residents, VEC \nis improving frontage roads in coordination with the provincial departments of transport. \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Traffic demand for the highway was reassessed, and the project\u2019s economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) including the additional financing was estimated by comparing the major road \nnetworks in northern Viet Nam with and without the project in the same methodology that was \nused at project appraisal.6 The project economic costs include (i) capital costs and resettlement \ncosts, excluding tax and price contingency; and (ii) the highway\u2019s O&M cost. The project\u2019s \neconomic benefits are lower vehicle operating costs and shorter passenger travel times, which \nwill benefit both the highway users and traffic on the existing roads. The EIRR estimated at \nappraisal for the original loans in 2007 was 18.1% under a toll rate of D1,000/km for passenger \ncars.  The  government  determined  to  set  the  toll  rate  for  the  highway  at  D1,500/km  for \npassenger cars. The estimated EIRR for the project with additional financing under the toll rate \nof D1,500/km is 36.6%, indicating that the project is economically viable. The EIRR for the \nproject with additional financing is higher than that at project appraisal in 2007, due to high \nvehicle operating costs and time savings as nonincremental benefits. For the time savings in \nparticular, estimates of the passenger time cost was based on the national average wage, which \nhas more than doubled since 2007 in real terms. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of \nthe project\u2019s economic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 10% increase in O&M \ncosts and a 10% reduction in benefits, do not impact the economic viability.   \n \n22.  The estimated financial internal rate of return of the project with the additional financing \nis 4.65% at a toll rate of D1,500/km, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \nestimated at 1.08%.7 The financial net present value of the project with the additional financing \nis $1,065.6 million. The results of the financial cost\u2013benefit analysis show that the project with \nthe additional financing is financially viable. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the \nimpact of adverse changes in key project variables on the financial viability. The sensitivity \nscenarios  include  a  10%  increase  in  outstanding  capital  expenditures,  a  10%  increase  in \noperating costs, and a 10% decrease in revenue. The results from the sensitivity analysis show \nthat the project remains financially viable in each tested scenario, with financial internal rates of \nreturn ranging from 3.70% to 4.65%. Financial net present values are still satisfactory against \nthe downside risks. An analysis of financial projections, financial statements, and key financial \nperformance indicators for VEC reveal that VEC will have adequate financial capacity to ensure \nthe  sustainability  of  the  project.  Overall,  the  results  of  the  financial  analysis  indicate  that \nrevenues to be generated by the project are likely to be more than sufficient to cover O&M \ncosts.  \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  A financial management assessment of VEC concludes that VEC has sufficient financial \nmanagement capacity and adequate financial management arrangements in place for project \nimplementation.  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and VEC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. \n \n25.  In 2011, ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity undertook a review of the project\u2019s \nprocurement procedures, internal controls, disbursements, and financial management system in \n                                                \n6 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nconsultation  with  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  (SERD).  It  also  conducted  an  asset \ninspection. The procurement review report, published in October 2012, identified issues in two \nareas: procurement and asset inspection.8 In procurement, the key findings were (i) a lack of \ndue diligence during prequalification of contractors and evaluation of bids, (ii) changes in bid \nevaluation  criteria  without  ADB  approval,  (iii)  flawed  evaluation  of  bidders\u2019  cash  flow,  (iv) \ninsufficient basis in assessing compliance with bid requirements,9 and (v) inaccurate evaluation \nin selecting consultants. Through an asset inspection, the review concluded that the delays in \nproject implementation were caused by contractors\u2019 insufficient financial capacity, which may \nhave resulted from the irregularities in procurement, and site clearance and resettlement issues. \nOn one contract, the review found that the winning bidder did not have the required cash flow \ncapacity as originally approved by ADB. Nevertheless, the contractor was selected as a result of \nmodifications to the cash flow capacity criterion made by VEC after prequalification and before \nbidding without ADB approval.10 The procurement review recommended that ADB consider \ndeclaring  misprocurement  or  intensify  oversight  to  ensure  that  the  contractor  successfully \ndelivers the desired output for the contract.  \n \n26.   While the procurement review was under way in late 2011 and up to mid-2012, review \nmissions by SERD discussed the findings with VEC, particularly with respect to the possible \nmisprocurement case (footnote 3). After the issuance of the final procurement review report in \nOctober 2012, SERD fielded another mission in November 2012 that came up with actions to \naddress  the  report\u2019s  recommendations.  In  considering  the  recommendation  to  declare \nmisprocurement  or  intensify  ADB's  oversight,  SERD  felt  that  the  latter  was  the  preferred \napproach for the following reasons: (i) the change to the criterion was made before bidding and \nall invited bids were evaluated based on the same modified criterion; (ii) the use of the original \ncriterion, which looked at bidder's working capital, had been discontinued, and by applying the \nnew standardized cash flow capacity criterion adopted bank-wide in August 2012,11 the winning \nbidder was found to have sufficient cash flow capacity to carry out the works; (iii) the contract \nwon by the winning bidder was by then in its third year, and while delay was observed at the \ntime  of  procurement  review,  the  performance  of  the  contractor  was  improving;12 and  (iv) \ndeclaring misprocurement would lead to termination of the current contract by VEC, which could \ninvite  contractual  disputes  between  the  contractor  and  VEC.  Considering  these  factors,  in \nNovember 2012, SERD opted to permit the current contractor to continue implementing the \nremaining  contractual  works  rather  than  declaring  misprocurement.  SERD  also  committed \nresources to closely oversee VEC\u2019s contract management under all ongoing contracts and \nensure  that  the  loan  proceeds  would  be  properly  utilized.  In  2013\u20132014,  quarterly  review \nmissions (instead of the normal biannual missions) were fielded. Viet Nam Resident Mission \nstaff have also been involved in the continual monitoring of the project.  \n \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2012. Project Procurement-Related Review Report Loans 2391 and 2392(SF)-VIE: GMS: Kunming\u2013Hai \nPhong Transport Corridor\u2014Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project. Manila.  \n9 Key findings are elaborated in paras. 51\u201355 of footnote 8. \n10 The ADB-approved bidding document had the following cash flow capacity criterion for this package: [(working \ncapital + lines of credit) \u2013 current contract commitments] \u2265 $20 million in 4.5 months. VEC modified this and added \n\u201cor lines of credit \u2265 $20 million in 4.5 months.\u201d Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. \nWith these modifications, the winning bidder, on account of its lines of credit of $40 million, qualified despite its \nnegative working capital, which would have disqualified the contractor had the ADB-approved original criterion been \nused. \n11 ADB\u2019s standard bidding document was revised in August 2012 and contains a streamlined method to assess \ncontractors\u2019 cash flow capacity.  \n12 By November 2012, the contractor had achieved a physical progress ratio of 30.4%. The work was substantially \ncompleted in June 2014, and the Highway was opened to traffic. \n ", "9 \n27.  In parallel, SERD dedicated more resources to (i) strengthen the review of procurement \nand consultant recruitment under other ADB-funded projects involving VEC, and (ii) increase the \nprocurement and anticorruption capacity of the Viet Nam transport sector executing agencies \nthat receive large volumes of ADB assistance. The capacity building would be implemented \nthrough structured training and collaboration between the Viet Nam Resident Mission and the \ngovernment\u2019s integrity and anticorruption body, with support from ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption \nand Integrity.   \n \n28.   To safeguard the proposed additional financing, ADB will continue to exercise enhanced \ndue diligence of contract management actions and on-site work by reviewing all contractual \nchanges and adjustments in advance, and by fielding frequent review missions involving staff \nwith contract management expertise. A project completion report with an expanded scope will \nbe prepared to provide details on how the procurement review recommendations have been \nimplemented. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The poverty reduction and social strategy envisaged at the time of the original project \nimplementation remains unchanged.13 Social impacts and risks on the communities in general \nand the households physically and economically affected by the project were satisfactorily \nmitigated by providing employment for the civil works. The income restoration programs, which \nwere provided the severely affected and vulnerable households with training and livelihood \ninputs, resulted to increase in their income. The gender aspects of the project are mainstreamed \ninto the resettlement and income restoration activities, job opportunities during construction, and \nthe HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness and prevention program. These activities are \nbeing managed and monitored by the project. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The additional financing is provided to bridge cost overruns of the civil works contracts \nwithin the existing project\u2019s scale and scope. There is no additional work on safeguards. It is \nclassified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The  cost  overruns  under  the  original  loans  may  occur  before  the  additional  loans \nbecome effective. VEC will then finance the cost overruns from the state budget. ADB will \nretroactively finance the cost overruns for up to 20% of the additional loan amount after the \nadditional loans become effective.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n32.  The government and VEC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n33.  The government and VEC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n                                                \n13 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \n \n34.  The disbursement of the loans is conditional upon the government\u2019s certification that the \nsubsidiary loan agreement between the government and VEC shall have been duly executed \nand delivered, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness are fulfilled. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.
