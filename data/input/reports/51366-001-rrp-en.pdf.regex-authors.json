THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guizhou Gui\u2019an New District New Urbanization \nSmart Transport System Development Project. The project will support Gui\u2019an in developing an \nintelligent transport system (ITS) and sustainable transport infrastructure.1 This will make public \ntransportation in Gui\u2019an a preferred mode of travel\u2014averting congestion, improving transport \nsafety, and making the city livable. This, in turn, will attract private sector investment and talented \nprofessionals.  Sustainable  green  transport  will  establish  Gui\u2019an  as  a  low-carbon  city.  This \ninnovative project is expected to play a demonstrative role in the Yangtze River Economic Belt \n(YREB) and beyond. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Strategic context. The YREB is one of the PRC\u2019s three key economic growth engines. \nIts nine provinces and two specially administered municipalities account for more than 40% of the \npopulation, 40% of freshwater resources, and about 45% of the country\u2019s economic output. While \nthe YREB has benefited from extensive development since the late 1980s, particularly in the \neastern delta area, economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin \nlags that of the coastal areas and is below its potential. These parts of the YREB still face \nsignificant development challenges as a result of (i) increasing pollution and pressure on natural \nresources;  (ii)  slow  transformation  into  green  development  and  economic  diversification; \n(iii) limited integration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; and (iv) weak institutional \ncoordination for strategic planning. The YREB faces a growing imbalance between economic \nachievement and environmental quality. To manage these challenges, the Government of the \nPRC formulated the YREB development plan, 2016\u20132030, which prioritizes ecological protection \nand the promotion of green development as the guiding principle for the YREB\u2019s future growth.2 \nInclusive green development aims to (i) shift from a traditional, subsector approach to a cross-\ncutting,  integrated  approach\u2014leading  to  a  sustainable  development  model;  (ii)  solve  the \nchallenges of rapid urbanization; and (iii) serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. \n  \n3.  Guizhou, in the southwest PRC, is part of the YREB but has slow economic growth. In \n2017, it had one of the lowest gross domestic products per capita in the PRC, at CNY37,956 or \n63.6% of the PRC average (CNY59,660), and its poverty rate of 7.75% was more than double the \nnational rate (3.10%). Some 46% of its population of 35.8 million is urban.   \n \n4.  The State Council of the PRC established Gui\u2019an New District (Gui\u2019an) as a new city in \nJanuary 2014, with the objective of making it the economic development driver of Guizhou and  \nsurrounding provinces. The key strategies for Gui\u2019an are to develop a high-level technology \ninnovation hub to attract talent and private business; encourage innovation and high-technology \nindustrial development; and conserve the natural environment to ensure a healthy green city and \nfoster ecotourism.3 This is in line with the PRC\u2019s new urban development strategy in its 13th five-\nyear plan, which places increasing importance on innovation, eco-friendly policies, and people-\n                                                \n1 Intelligent  Transport  Systems  are  applications  that  combine  leading-edge  information  and  communications \ntechnologies used in transportation which help relieve congestion, reduce pollution and increase safety. Sustainable \ntransport  infrastructure  is  defined as  transport  infrastructure  that  provides  mobility  that  is  accessible,  safe, \nenvironment-friendly, and affordable for the present and future generations. \n2  Government of the PRC. 2016.

Guiyang. \n ", "2 \ncentered development and urbanization.4 To be able to meet these key strategies, Gui\u2019an has to \nbe livable, with transport playing a crucial role in its development. \n \n5.  Gui\u2019an\u2019s planned development area spreads over 1,795 square kilometers. Its population \nis 0.73 million (2016 estimate) and is expected to reach 2.30 million in 2030. Gui\u2019an is growing \nexponentially, with gross domestic product expected to increase by about 58% annually from \nCNY17 billion in 2015 to CNY150 billion in 2020, targeting 11% agriculture, 56% industry, and \n33% service sector development, reflecting the government\u2019s focus on urbanization. \n \n6.  Challenges. Within Gui\u2019an\u2019s planned development area is Gui\u2019an Direct Administrative \nDistrict (GDAD), the project area. GDAD covers 470 square kilometers and forms the core of \nGui\u2019an. It is designed to have four distinct economic zones (city center, technology, universities, \nand tourism) with a population of 330,000 in 2017 that is set to double by 2020 and reach \n1.4 million  by  2030  (footnote  3).  Public  transport  in  GDAD  is  still  in  its  initial  stages  of \ndevelopment. There is heavy reliance on private modes of transport and the share of public \ntransport is only 10%. Since the opening of the first bus route in July 2014, only a total of nine bus \nroutes have been in operation. Bus services are unreliable with passenger waiting times of about \n30 to 45 minutes. Road incidents are also high (1,430 crashes in 2018) relative to the exisiting \npopulation. \n \n7.  Without  transport  system  integration  and  communication,  GDAD  will  experience \ninadequate transport connectivity, including suboptimal road infrastructure planning and traffic \nsignaling, traffic bottlenecks, and congestion. A lack of integrated public transport infrastructure \nand systems leads to poorly planned timetables and overcrowding. Consequently, users become \nfrustrated with their experience of public transportation and choose other options such as private \nvehicles, resulting in lower ridership in public transportation. The resulting inefficiencies reduce \nmobility within the urban environment; hinder the ability to attract residents, tourists, and private \nsector investments; and constrain overall economic growth. \n \n8.  Rapid economic and population growth and urbanization have strained the delivery of \nbasic services and transportation systems in cities. This has resulted in overcrowded road \nnetworks, poor traffic management, a high rate of traffic incidents, and parking difficulties. Poor \nand inadequate provision of public transport and its associated facilities has led to mobility and \nconnectivity  problems  for  citizens,  especially  the  underprivileged.  Traffic  congestion  has \ncontributed to deterioration of the air quality and higher fuel consumption and carbon emissions. \nThe PRC has recognized the need for balancing urban development strategies with measures to \naddress the transport problems that arise in cities, particularly in the western region. Overcoming \nthese issues will require improving urban development and transport systems and processes.  \n \n9.  As a new urban core, GDAD has the opportunity to chart a development path building on \nlessons learned in other cities, focusing from the start on economic growth and urbanization that \nis people-centered, integrated, environment-friendly, and innovative. To establish a sustainable \ntransport system and minimize key mobility-related challenges, an integrated transport system \ncharacterized by high public transport utilization is required. The development of an ITS that \nconnects all modes of transport, facilitates travel demand management measures, and provides \na seamless public transport experience, particularly to users switching between modes, is the \nfoundation of sustainable mobility. It is also a key pillar in sustainable urbanization and the \ncreation of more livable cities. Without active forward planning and technological innovation, \n                                                \n4  Government of the PRC. 2015.

Beijing. \n \n ", "3 \nGDAD\u2019s targets of a public transport modal share of 60% and a green transport modal share of \n80% by 2030 will be difficult to achieve.5 \n \n10.  Proposed solutions. Technology plays a crucial role in developing sustainable transport \nnetworks and systems. Intellignet transport systems (ITSs) can connect transport networks across \nmodes, improving efficiency, coordination, and safety. They use information and communication \ntechnology in vehicles and transport infrastructure to collect, manage, and distribute information \nto improve transport outcomes. ITSs use a range of technologies that provide information to \nenable  services  such  as  coordinated  incident  and  emergency  response  systems;  and \nmanagement  of  parking,  public  transport,  bicycle  sharing  systems,  and  freight.  ITSs  can \naccelerate better and faster development of surface transportation and reduce accidents by about \n7%.6 To ensure that the introduction of the ITS results in more inclusive, gender-sensitive \ntransport solutions, the project team used human-centered design (HCD) methodology\u2014an \ninnovation that aims to make products and systems user-friendly by focusing on the users and \ntheir needs, and by applying human factors. \n \n11.  These ITS services provide various users and operators with critical information for \ndecision making, enabling safer and more coordinated use of transport networks, and optimizing \ninfrastructure utilization. One key ITS service is traffic demand management, which harnesses \ntraffic and user data to determine transport demand and redistribute users over time or to alternate \nroutes. This enables people and freight to move easier, reducing congestion and emissions, \nimproving the quality of the urban environment, and encouraging economic growth. \n \n12.  Developing  a  sustainable  transport  system  includes  the  improved  use  of  public \ntransportation, and provision and use of clean energy public transport modes such as electric \nbuses, which are proven to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and local emissions in cities. Electric \nbuses reduce GHG emissions by 30%\u201340% and do not contribute to local nitrogen oxides and \nemissions from particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Cities could reduce \ntheir GHG emissions in turn by 8%\u201312%. The implementation of electric buses in a system will \nimprove the overall mobility and sustainability of the urban transport system and compound the \npositive impact of the technology.7    \n \n13.  ITS technologies and services can be complemented by advances in vehicle technology \nsuch as intelligent connected vehicles,8 electric vehicles, and electric buses, to provide more \nenvironment-friendly  and  efficient  transport  services.  The  adoption  of  these  high-level \ntechnologies  and  their  integration  into  the  urban  fabric  is  crucial  for  the  development  of \nsustainable urban transport systems. Up-front planning and design of an efficient, integrated \nurban transport system in new cities\u2014incorporating the needs of its users\u2014is crucial to avoid the \nproblems of historic, car-centric transport systems and achieve the vision of a livable city with \nsustainable economic growth.  \n \n14.  Value added by ADB assistance. Under Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the project will focus on two of the seven operational priorities: (i) making cities more \nlivable; and (ii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability.9 ADB will help GDAD explore new and existing technologies and \n                                                \n5  Green transport is the use of transport modes that do not negatively impact the environment and that use clean \nenergy. The modal share by 2030 is envisaged to be 25% walking, 5.0% bicycle, 27.5% bus, 22.5% train, and \n20.0% car and/or motorcycle. \n6  ADB. 2016.

ADB will add value by introducing an ITS in new urban \ndevelopment through new technologies and best practices in project design and implementation, \nincluding international expertise at the forefront of ITS development, an intelligent connected \nvehicle system (ICVS), and clean transport technology. ADB\u2019s involvement provides access to \ninternational best practice in HCD. ADB provides a platform to transfer knowledge in sustainable, \ninclusive, and participatory urban transport planning, design, and operation to other regions. The \nexperience and knowledge gained from such an innovative project can also be replicated in other \ncities in and outside the PRC.10  \n \n15.  During project preparation, the project team gathered extensive user and stakeholder \nfeedback to identify innovation opportunities on the ITS, buses, and bus stations using HCD \nmethodology. The HCD research also guided the design of communication and participation \nmechanisms.11 The communication strategy focuses on integrating stakeholder inputs into the \nplanning and implementation of the ITS and transport infrastructure so that road users, including \nunderrepresented groups, can participate in providing solutions to key accessibility and mobility \nissues. The project will launch behavior change communication campaigns to increase patronage \nfor public buses and other green transport modes. The social development and gender action \nplan contributes to narrowing the digital divide in GDAD.12  \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s participation will create an enabling environment that will ensure opportunities for \nprivate  sector  participation  by  (i)  creating  a  livable  city  to  attract  and  retain  workers;  (ii) \nstrengthening the transport backbone so the private sector can invest in additional auxiliary \nservices, such as car-sharing or wayfinding applications; and (iii) facilitating a high-technology \nworkforce to provide a qualified labor pool thereby attracting private sector investments.  \n \nB.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The executing agency for the project is the GGAND, acting through the Bureau of \nEconomic Development of Gui\u2019an. GGAND established the project management office (PMO) \nunder the Bureau of Economic Development of Gui\u2019an. GGAND will establish three project \nimplementation units to assist the PMO in implementing bus hubs and buses, charging stations, \nand supporting roads. GGAND will recruit a project management consultant to assist in project \nmanagement, technical support, safeguard monitoring, the social development and gender action \nplan, and implementation of the communication strategy. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2019\u2013December 2025 \nEstimated completion date   December 2025 \nEstimated loan closing date  June 2026 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \nDeputy director general, Government of Gui\u2019an New District Management \nCommittee (chair) \n                                                \n17  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nLeaders from 24 project-related government agencies, entities, and townships \n(members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  Government of Gui\u2019an New District, acting through the Bureau of Economic \nDevelopment of Gui\u2019an  \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding   16 contracts  \u20ac122.76 million  \n(with international advertisement)  ($139.89 million equivalent) \nOpen competitive bidding   13 contracts  \u20ac45.80 million  \n(with national advertisement)   ($52.21 million equivalent) \nConsulting services   QCBS  8 packages  \u20ac5.20 million  \n($5.93 million equivalent) \nAdvance contracting   Advance contracting will apply to the recruitment of consultants and procurement \nof civil works and goods.  \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \nNote: Values are for ADB financing only.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  The project is technically feasible. The project team conducted feasibility studies for the \nITS,  public  transport,  and  sustainable  infrastructure  components.  The  studies  included  the \nadoption of advanced technologies for (i) transport and data communication provision, (ii) the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of electric buses, and (iii) charging systems. The project team \nselected suitable ITS design and engineering solutions considering costs, climate, environmental \nand  social  impacts,  and  O&M  capacities.  Preliminary  designs  of  the  data  center  and  ITS \ncomponents comply with the ITS conceptual design and data and communications standards in the \nPRC. Electric bus specifications and bus depot configuration adhere to international and domestic \nstandards. The project team prepared a generic testing guideline and an ICVS safety framework \nbased on the currently available ICVS technologies and commonly used testing scenarios. HCD \nfeatures are incorporated in the integrated bus information system and bus station designs. \nMoreover, the project team designed programs to build smart transport capacity based on needs \nassessments, social surveys, and institutional analyses.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  Economic analysis. The project team assessed the economic viability of the overall project \nand the main subcomponents in accordance  with ADB\u2019s guidelines.18 The overall project is \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 16.8%. Economic benefits \nof  the  project  include  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  time  savings,  safety  benefits,  and \nemissions reduction. The project will also generate unquantifiable wider economic benefits such as \nimproved connectivity and poverty reduction. A sensitivity analysis of potential cost overruns and \nbenefit reductions demonstrates that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.19 \n \n28.  Financial analysis. The project team conducted a financial analysis to establish the \nproject\u2019s financial  viability  and  sustainability.20 For the three revenue-generating subprojects \n(charging stations, bus hubs, and electic buses), ADB based the financial viability assessment on \nthe comparison between the projected financial internal rate of return and the weighted average \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2017.

The project team assessed the charging station subproject as financially viable, as \nits projected financial internal rate of return exceeds the weighted average cost of capital. For the \nbus hubs and electric buses, government subsidies will be needed to service the O&M costs during \noperations. The financial sustainability assessment indicates that the GGAND has enough funds to \nsupport  the  counterpart  funding  requirements,  provided  that  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments continue providing budget subsidies. However, reliance on these subsidies presents \na risk to the project\u2019s financial sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance  \n \n29.  Financial management. The financial management risk is moderate mainly because \n(i) the executing agency is unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s financial management policy and procedures, \nand (ii) the PMO lacks financial management staff. The executing agency needs to strengthen its \nfinancial management capacity by establishing a new financial management unit under the PMO, \nwith adequate and experienced financial staff who are well trained in ADB\u2019s financial management \npolicy and procedures. The project team will conduct training activities at regular intervals during \nthe  processing  and  implementation  stages.  The  project  team  incorporated  the  mitigation \nmeasures agreed with the GGAND into the project design and will monitor these measures during \nproject implementation, as specified in the PAM. \n \n30.  Procurement and anticorruption. The project team conducted an assessment of the \nproject  procurement  risk,  subject  to  the  procurement  capacity  of  the  executing  agency,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. The procurement risk of the project is assessed medium \nbefore  mitigation  measures.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  GGAND.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n31.  The project will introduce efficient, affordable, and user-friendly public transport into an \nurbanizing but still predominantly rural area\u2014enabling economic development and averting future \ncongestion and pollution. The project\u2019s direct beneficiaries will include women and the poor. The \nITS will be an enabler for GDAD\u2019s vision to become a technology hub that offers high quality of life, \nattracting entrepreneurial talent from across the PRC. In the long term, the project will benefit \nGDAD\u2019s residents and businesses by ensuring high-quality and affordable mobility in a livable city. \nThe project also targets at least 30% women to be employed in new skilled jobs such as ticketing, \nbus driving, and maintenance. \n \n32.  Project preparation relied on extensive consultations with residents\u2014including women, former \nfarmers, and the elderly\u2014using HCD methods. These consultations resulted in proposals for gender- \nand disability-sensitive bus and station design, which will be developed in the detailed design. The \ncapacity strengthening component aims to narrow the digital divide in GDAD by (i) running inclusion-\nfocused hackathons to develop ITS applications and services related to traffic safety, green mobility, \ngender, and disability inclusion; and (ii) motivate school-aged girls to consider careers in the fields of \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics by participating in ITS coding camps. The project \nteam developed a communication strategy to support the project\u2019s behavior change and inclusive \nparticipation aims. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.21 \n \n34.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP), in accordance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The project area and its vicinity do not involve any environmentally \nsensitive areas or physical cultural heritage. Potential negative environmental impacts during \nconstruction are short-term and localized; and are associated with fugitive dust, construction \nnoise, wastewater, solid waste, disruption of traffic, and risks to occupational and community \nhealth and safety. Potential negative environmental impacts during operation include noise, \nwaste, and wastewater at bus depots, hubs and stations, traffic noise, and emission induced from \nprojects roads; hazardous materials from bus service areas; and end of life-cycle buses and \nbatteries  that  require  replacement.  The  EMP  describes  mitigation  measures,  monitoring \nrequirements, and institutional responsibilities for ensuring adequate environmental management \nthroughout  the  project\u2019s  construction  and  operation.  The  project  team  will  handle  potential \nenvironmental  complaints  or  disputes  in  accordance  with  the  grievance  redress  mechanism \nestablished for the project. The executing agency committed to implement the agreed EMP, as \nreflected in the PAM and loan covenants. The IEE disclosed relevant project information and \ndocuments to the affected people and conducted meaningful public consultation in accordance with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement. The project team will conduct continuous reassessment of impact \nareas and consultations throughout project implementation. \n \n35.  The project team conducted a climate risk and vulnerability assessment and concluded \nthat the highest risk that climate change poses to the project is higher flood peak flows resulting \nfrom increased intensity of storm events. To address this risk, the project team augmented the \nintensity  of  design  storms  by  10%  in  designing  the  road  systems  and  sizing  drainage \npipes/channels.  The detailed design team will also consider the potential effects of increased \nstorm peak flows caused by climate change in setting the locations of important facilities and \nwater-proofing project components, including electrical equipment. \n \n36.  The project team adopted a two-phased approach for the ICVS demonstration testing as \nreflected in the project agreement. During project processing, the first phase, the project team \nprepared a generic testing guideline and an ICVS safety framework based on the currently \navailable ICVS technology and a commonly used ICVS testing plan scenario. During project \nimplementation, the second phase, the team will engage ICVS experts to guide, review, and provide \nrecommendations on the detailed design, testing plan scenarios, and safety management plan.  \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  will  occupy  698.57  mu \n(46.57 hectares [ha]) of land for bus stations and charging stations, of which 481.96 mu (32.13 ha) \nis previously acquired state-owned land and 216.61 mu (14.44 ha) is rural collective land that needs \nto be acquired. The land acquisition will not impact any residential units.22 A total of 161 households \nwith 697 persons will be affected marginally by land acquisition, since agriculture accounts for less \nthan 2% of household income. The average land loss rate is about 6% of the total land and \nnonsignificant in nature. A resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared and disclosed. The PMO will \nensure that compensation is paid in cash before acquisition and taking physical possession of the \nland. The project aims to provide skilled and unskilled job opportunities for local people during \nproject construction and operation. Affected households will be given priority for such employment. \nThe  PMO  will  appoint  a  dedicated  resettlement  officer  to  handle  resettlement  planning  and \n                                                \n21 ADB.

The project management consultant will support the  PMO in \nimplementing the resettlement plan.  An external monitoring agency will be recruited to monitor the \nimplementation of the resettlement plan.   \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Ethnic minorities in GDAD are well-integrated socially \nand economically into the urban fabric, and do not present any specific vulnerabilities. The social \nanalysis has confirmed that they will not suffer any adverse impacts as a result of the project.  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n39.
