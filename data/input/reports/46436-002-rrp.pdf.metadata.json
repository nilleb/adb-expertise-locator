It  will  provide  business  support  services  and  financing  to \nagribusinesses.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSamoa  has  yet  to  return  to  pre-tsunami  (2009)  economic  growth  levels,  which  the \ngovernment seeks to redress through promoting tourism and agriculture. Revitalizing agriculture \nand  increasing  exports  therefore  feature  prominently  in  the  government\u2019s  policy  framework, \nincluding  the  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa,  the  Agricultural  Sector  Plan,  and  the \nNational  Export  Strategy.  Agriculture  and  fisheries  contributed  only  9.7%  to  Samoa\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product in 2012, down from 20% in the 1990s.3 Food and agricultural product imports \n(26%\u201328%  of  total  imports)  contribute  significantly  to  Samoa\u2019s  overall  trade  deficit.  Although \nagriculture employs 32.9% of the total workforce, rural unemployment or underemployment is a \nmajor  concern.  Subsistence  production  dominates  Samoa\u2019s  agriculture sector,  with occasional \nsurpluses for  sale in local  markets. The  2009  agricultural  census  reports  that  only  3%  of rural \nhouseholds  received  their  main  income  from  selling  agricultural  produce. 4  The  smallholder \nsector is being supported through a World Bank project.5    \n \n4. \nIn the agribusiness sector, including commercial farming and agro-industrial enterprises, \ntrade  statistics  show  a  total  agriculture  food  export  (fresh  and  processed)  decline  from  ST61 \nmillion  in  2002  to  ST45  million  in  2012.6 Agribusinesses  are  critical  for  stimulating  agricultural \nproduction,  even  though  their  total  number  is  small,  yet  they  are  not  supported.  While \nagribusinesses have few price-based comparative advantages in the international market, they \nhave  comparative  advantage  in  niche  markets.  Most  agribusinesses  are  small-scale,  family-\nowned  enterprises  with  fewer  than  400  employees,  mostly  in  agro-industrial  production  (e.g., \nchili  sauce,  banana  chips)  and  fresh  products  for  export  (e.g.,  taro,  Tahitian  lime).  Average \nannual  turnover  levels  are  $200,000  for  smaller  and  above  $1  million  for  a  few  larger \ncompanies.  However,  they  provide  employment  and  income-earning  opportunities  for  many \nsmallholder  families  in  Samoa  as  suppliers  for  raw  materials,  acting  as  inclusive  businesses. \nAgribusiness development is therefore essential for promoting agriculture\u2019s role in the economy. \n \nValue  chain  analyses  and  a  sector  assessment  confirmed  that  there  is  potential  for \n5. \nexport  expansion  and  import  substitution. 7 The  studies  also  revealed  patterns  of  weaknesses \nand bottlenecks, which contribute to the low investment and value addition in the sector. Some \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Samoa AgriBusiness \nSupport Project (ADB. 2012.

With few exceptions, Samoan agribusinesses struggle \nto  procure  sufficient  and  consistently  good  quality  raw  materials.  Examples  include  (i)  virgin \ncoconut  oil  producers  that  cannot  fill  existing  export  orders,  and  (ii)  shortages  of  taro  for \nprocessing into snack foods and of the appropriate fresh varieties for export. Most enterprises \nprocure  the  raw  materials  offered  to  them  by  smallholders  but  do  not  actively  encourage \nproduction \nfarming,  outgrower \narrangements,  or  product  collection  networks.  Through  effective  participation  in  value  chains, \nrural  producers  and  agribusinesses  will  increase  household  incomes  and  sales  volumes,  and \ncreate more jobs.   \n \n7. \nThe  agribusiness  survey  further  identified  the  need  for  a  range  of  business  support \nservices.  Businesses  producing  for  the  local  or  export  markets  are  failing  to  achieve  the \nrequired  consistent  standards  to  compete  effectively  and/or  satisfy  overseas  markets\u2019  entry \nrequirements.  Common  weaknesses  include  (i)  lack  of  technical  skills  for  effective  production \nmanagement,  establishment  and  maintenance  of  strong  supply  chains,  and  for  food  safety \nstandards accreditation; (ii) inadequate export planning and marketing; and (iii) weak business \nand  financial  management.  With  limited  technical  and  business  support  services  available, \ncompanies report difficulties in accessing support from regional donor-supported programs.10   \n \nThe lack of capital and finance further constrains business expansion and diversification. \n8. \nLoans are difficult to obtain and expensive due to insufficient acceptable collateral, limited own \ncapital,  and  the  banks\u2019  overall  negative  perception  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  enterprise \ncapabilities.  Commercial  banks  require  200%  security  cover,  compared  to  the  regional  and \nglobal  requirement  of  150%. 11 Commercial  bank  loans  to  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries \nprojects  totaled  only  1.3%  of  total  bank  loan  volume,  while  6%  of  loans  went  to  the \nmanufacturing  sector,  which  includes  agribusinesses. 12 Companies  face  difficulties  securing \nadditional  equity  as  there  is  no  local  stock  exchange  or  equity  and/or  venture  capital  or \nprovident funds interested in relatively small agriculture and/or agribusiness projects in Samoa.  \n \n9. \nThe project aims to boost economic performance through increased trade and address \nmarket failures associated with export barriers arising from value chain constraints. The project \nwill lessen these constraints while operating within the national strategic and policy frameworks\u2019 \nobjectives.  These  objectives  emphasize  developing  commercial  farming  and  export-oriented \nagribusinesses  in  parallel  with  the  smallholder  subsector  and  complementing  development \npartners\u2019  activities.  The  private  sector  focus  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  emphasis  on  private  sector \ndevelopment  as documented  in the  Pacific  Approach and Samoa country  operations  business \nplan. 13 The  project  design  reflects  lessons  from  other  agribusiness,  financing  scheme,  and \nprivate  sector  development  programs  in  the  Pacific  islands  and  Samoa  (footnote  8).

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nlesson  was  that  simply  addressing  the  common  constraint  of  limited  access  to  affordable  and \nappropriate  finance  was  insufficient.  Financing  must  be  tailored  to  the  country  context  and \ncoupled  with  technical  and  business  support  services  throughout  the  value  chain  to  achieve \nimpact.  The  support  services  will  also  reduce  the  banks\u2019  concerns  about  potential  borrowers\u2019 \ninternal capabilities and will help leverage commercial finance. \n \n10. \nThe  multiple  constraints,  together  with  the  challenges  of  a  small  island  state,  preclude \nstandard  solutions.  Solutions  need  to  include  (i)  commercial  banks  as  the  lead  facilitators  of \nprivate  sector  development,  (ii)  capital  to strengthen the  balance  sheet  of  agribusinesses,  and \n(iii)  technical  and  managerial  support  throughout  the  value  chain.  The  project  will  therefore \nsupport  developing  the  agribusiness  sector  in  two  complementary  areas:  (i)  suitable  financing \ninstruments and (ii) business support services. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  impact  will  be  that  the  agriculture  sector  regains  its  prominence  in  the \n\n11. \neconomy. The outcome will be that selected commercial agribusinesses grow sustainably.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nfinancing \n\nOutput  1:  Partner  agribusinesses  are  provided  with  suitable  financing  services. \n12. \nThe  innovative  approach  to  financing  will  be  through  a  financial  intermediary  (FI)  modality, \nadjusted  to  the  Samoan  context.  The  design  considers  lessons  from  other  ADB  FI  projects \n(footnote  8).  Participating  banks  (FIs)  will  provide \nto  eligible  subborrowers \n(agribusinesses or partner companies) that are sound and have bankable business plans. The \napproach  includes  (i)  cash  collateral  (from  grant  proceeds)  to  partly  secure  loans  by \nparticipating banks, address the constraints of inadequate collateral, and enable bank lending; \nand  (ii)  repayable  supplemental  seed  capital  (SSC)  to  address  inadequate  capital  and  weak \nbalance sheet structure.  \n \n13. \nThe cash collateral will be used to secure up to 50% of the amount  FIs lend to eligible \nsubborrowers for first-time loans and up to 30% for second-time loans. Through this structure, \neach dollar of collateral will leverage twice the amount of bank lending. The FI can secure the \nloan\u2019s portion, not cash collateralized, according to its own prudential standards. The maximum \nloan for subborrowers is $750,000. This approach should contribute to an overall lower interest \nrate for the agribusinesses. SSC injections of a maximum $100,000 per company are intended \nto improve potential subborrowers\u2019 equity position if it would then be eligible for a loan as the FI \ndetermines.  SSC  is  limited  to  25%  of  total  subproject  costs,  with  the  remaining  part  being \ncontributed through the subborrower\u2019s own capital and bank financing.  \n \nAn eligible subborrower will (i) be an enterprise in the agriculture or agribusiness sector, \n14. \n(ii) meet all conditions and requirements in Samoa\u2019s foreign investment legislation, and (iii) meet \ncredit  and  other  risk-related  criteria  as  the  FI  determines. 14  To  be  as  market  oriented  as \npossible,  the  FI  will  assess  the  eligibility  and  commercial  viability  of  selected  agribusiness \nproposals  through  their  own  stringent  due  diligence  process.  Based  on  a  positive  credit \nassessment,  the  FI  will  structure  and  negotiate  suitable  financing  (subloan)  agreements, \n\n                                                \n14 Subproject eligibility will be based on (i) a finding of commercial viability based on the financial intermediary\u2019s (FI\u2019s) \ndue  diligence,  (ii)  whether  the  subborrower  meets  at least 25%  of  its costs by  a cash  or  in-kind  contribution,  (iii) \nwhether it contributes to diversification and/or expansion of agribusinesses, and (iv) whether it makes a beneficial \ncontribution to the agriculture sector or employment. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nincluding  potential  SSC  portions,  and  it  will  monitor  the  subborrower\u2019s  performance  during  the \nagreement\u2019s  lifetime.  A  facility  manager  (FM)  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  in  project  implementation.  The  FM\u2019s  tasks  will  also  include \nidentification of agribusinesses for referral to the FI, overseeing the FI\u2019s screening and selection \nprocess, involvement in the due diligence processes of the agribusiness, and joint performance \nmonitoring  with  the  FI.  It  is  estimated  that  10  to  15  businesses  can  be  supported  during  the \nproject.  Investments  are  expected  to  finance  vertically  integrated  value  chains,  for  example  a \ntaro chips producer exporting to the New Zealand market that is upgrading its snack processing \nfacility and contracting a group of taro producers for raw materials. \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Partner  agribusinesses  are  provided  with  business  support  services. \nThese services may comprise specific technical or financial management skills, and they will be \nidentified  during  the  due  diligence  process  of  selected  agribusinesses.  For  the  taro  chips \nproducer,  this  could  be  support  in  establishing  proper  outgrower  schemes  with  farmers,  or \nimproving  products  to  fulfill  importer  requirements  (e.g.,  food  safety  standards).  The  FM  will \ncoordinate and provide individually tailored business support services by establishing workable \narrangements  with  regional  support  programs  and  sourcing  specific  technical  expertise.15 The \nFM  will  work  with  FIs  to  (i)  identify  needed  business  support  services;  (ii)  ensure  the  greatest \ndevelopment  impact  possible;  (iii)  verify  that  ADB\u2019s  social  and  environmental  safeguard \nstandards as well as eligibility and assessment criteria are adhered to,16 and after FI approval; \nroles  and \n(iv)  establish  business  partnership  arrangements  outlining \nresponsibilities,  such  as  cost-sharing  arrangements.  A  small  agribusiness  innovation  scheme \nwill be made available to businesses for specific short-term purposes on a reimbursable basis. \n \n16. \nthe FM, will be established to monitor and evaluate project progress.  \n \nD. \n\nOutput  3:  The  project  is  efficiently  and  effectively  managed.

A PMU will be set up in the \nMOF\u2019s  Aid  Coordination  and  Debt  Management  Division.  There  will  be  a  project  advisory \ncommittee, which will advise as needed to support the PMU on implementation issues.18 There \nwill  be  two  implementing  agencies:  the  participating  FIs  for  output  1,  and  the  MOF  for \nimplementation of outputs 2 and 3. The FM will support implementation of output 2 and overall \nproject coordination and implementation.  \n \nThe financing instruments will be open to all Samoan banks19 if they meet the eligibility \n20. \ncriteria  and  due  diligence  requirements,20 including  (i)  corporate,  financial,  management,  and \ngovernance practices acceptable to ADB and the MOF; (ii) financial soundness and compliance \nwith applicable prudential guidelines; (iii) satisfaction of ADB\u2019s integrity, anti-money laundering, \nand combating the financing of terrorism due diligence requirements; and (iv) adequate policies, \nsystems,  and  procedures  to  assess  and  monitor  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nimpact of subprojects. ANZ Bank (Samoa) has met the requirements and has a good reputation \nand almost 50% market share. Hence, the government, with ADB\u2019s concurrence, selected ANZ \nBank  (Samoa)  as  a  financial  intermediary  to  receive  at  least  40%  of  the  grant  proceeds \nallocated  as  cash  collateral  and  SSC.  The  remaining  amounts  will  be  allocated  by  the  PMU, \nsubject to ADB concurrence, to further eligible FIs as the project develops. \n \n21. \nRelending (government to FI). The ADB grant to the government will be in US dollars. \nA portion of up to $3 million will be used for the FI channel (output 1), of which approximately $2 \nmillion  will  be  for  cash  collateral  and  approximately  $1  million  for  repayable  SSC.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  the  funds,  comprising  cash  collateral  and  SSC  portions,  to  the  FIs  in \nlocal  currency  under  the  subsidiary  financing  agreement, 21 and  ADB  will  enter  into  project \nagreements with the same FI.  \n                                                \n17 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Samoa had a  high risk of debt \ndistress and was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n18 The  advisory  committee  will  comprise  of  the  MOF;  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Fisheries;  Ministry  of  Commerce, \n\nIndustry and Labour; Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; and private sector representatives. \n\n19 These are ANZ Bank (Samoa), National Bank of Samoa, Samoa Commercial Bank, and Westpac Bank Samoa. \n20 ADB. 2003.

After subloans A or B have been repaid, the FI can reuse funds \nfor future loans.23 \n \n23. \nShould  the  FI  not  use  the  funds  within  the  time  specified  in  the  subsidiary  financing \nagreement, it will pay the undrawn amounts, including SSC, to the MOF, which will agree with \nADB  on  the  reallocation  of  these  funds  for  the  same  purpose  to  other  FIs.  After  project \ncompletion and final repayment of all subloans (whichever is later), the FI will pay the undrawn \ncash  collateral  portion,  repaid  SSC,  and  any  interest  incurred  on  the  amounts  into  an \nagribusiness  finance  account  held  with  the  MOF.  An  option  paper  prepared  by  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  in  year  3  will  outline  potential  strategies  for  future  use  of  these  funds  after  the \nproject\u2019s  lifetime.24 FIs  will  observe ADB\u2019s  social  and  environmental  safeguard requirements  in \nthe subborrower\u2019s due diligence process. \n  \n24. \nSamoa\u2019s  circumstances  warrant  allowing  a  portion  of  the  grant  proceeds  to  be  passed \non  a  concessional  basis  to  the  FIs  and  to  eligible  subborrowers,  who  are  the  ultimate \nbeneficiaries. 25  The  country  context  requires  long-term  engagement  and  an  acceptance  of \nhigher  transaction  costs (or  lower fee  income) to  achieve anticipated  outcomes.  The financing \nconstraints, including lack of capital, and internal capacities make it challenging and expensive \nfor  agribusinesses  to  grow.  Additional  fees  would  only  increase  their  capital  cost.  The  project \ndesign  incorporates features  that  enhance  sustainability,  aims  at  recouping the  investments  at \nthe  end  of the  project\u2019s  lifetime,  and  stimulates future  commercial  banks\u2019  lending to  the sector \n(footnote 8). Together with the government\u2019s commitment to recycle the grant proceeds beyond \nproject completion, sustainability of the grant benefits will be maximized.  \n \nThe  terms  of  reference  for  the  required  key  consulting  positions  are  outlined  in  the \n25. \nproject administration manual (PAM).26 The total consulting inputs are currently estimated at 87 \nperson-months.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  under  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Additional consulting services, estimated at \n32 person-months, will be determined after the inception phase and business support services \nneeds  for  potential  partner  businesses  have  been  identified.  This  consulting  expertise  will  be \nrecruited following an indefinite delivery contract modality to allow flexibility in responding to the \nneeds  during  implementation.  Procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  conducted  under \nprovisions of para. 3.12 of ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe agribusiness innovation scheme will be administered by the PMU and is further detailed in \nthe  PAM.  The  project  will  be  implemented  over  7  years.  Table  3  summarizes  and  the  PAM \ndetails the implementation arrangements.  \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \ninterest  accrued  on  such  amounts  upon  project  completion.  There  will  be  no  commitment  fee  charged  to  the \nfinancial intermediary. \n\n22 The term accommodates a phased approach and enables longer-term equipment financing. \n23 Further description on use of funds can be found in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n24 Through this hands-on approach, it is anticipated that default rates will remain below current default rates. \n25 ADB. 2013.

A  sector  assessment  provided  the  rationale  and  identified  some  high-level \nconstraints.  Value  chain  analyses  and  investment  profiles  assessed  the  technical  aspects  of \nactual  and  potential  agribusiness  investments  and  identified  the  bottlenecks  to  be  addressed \nwithin  value  chains.  The  analyses  confirmed  that  Samoa  has  a  sustainable  comparative \nadvantage  in  some  export-based  agribusinesses,  especially  those  where  Samoa  formerly \ndominated  (e.g.,  taro).  It  also  highlighted  the  need  for  supply  chain  development  to  ensure \nconstant raw material supply and for market access support. The agribusiness survey analyzed \nthe  agribusiness  sector\u2019s  structure  and  its  capabilities,  resources,  and  needs.  The  survey \nconfirmed the potential for expansion and/or diversification and identified systemic weaknesses. \nThe options analysis, combined with a review of lessons from other projects and initiatives in the \nAsia  and  the  Pacific  region,  led  to  preferring  an  approach  combining  financing  support  with \nbusiness  support  services  through  the  private  sector.  A  climate  risk  screening  was  conducted \nthat considered the project to be at low risk. \n \n27. \nANZ  Bank  (Samoa)  was  identified  as  FI  under  the  required  eligibility  criteria  based  on \ntheir  strategy,  financial  position  and  performance,  and  financial  management  systems.  An \nintegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted,  and  ANZ  Bank  (Samoa)  was  found  eligible  to \nparticipate.27 Detailed eligibility criteria for FI,28 subborrowers, and subprojects were established \nand  are  detailed  in  the  PAM  and  the  environmental  and  social  management  system \narrangement (ESMS).29   \n                                                \n27  Due  Diligence  on  ANZ  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).

The  project  will  select  partners  primarily  through  the  FI  channel,  but  will  also \nprioritize  subprojects  with  broader  rural  development  impacts  through  creating  employment \nopportunities or improving value chain integration and removing supply chain bottlenecks. \n \n29. \nThe  financial  analysis  (footnote  30)  demonstrates  that  the  project  is  expected  to \ngenerate positive and sustainable financial returns to the participants, which averaged 20% for \nthe 3 investment profiles. The investment profiles (footnote 7) show examples of agribusinesses \nthat  can  mostly  generate  reasonable  financial  returns  for  the  investor,  but  only  after  an  initial \nperiod of losses due to purchase of equipment. Such ventures will be funded by combining the \nowner\u2019s  equity  and  debt,  with  debt  comprising  up  to  50%  of  the  financing  package.  Partner \nenterprises will benefit from lower interest rates related to the cash collateral arrangements. \n \n30. \nThe  beneficiaries  will  include  the  shareholders  of  partner  businesses  and  their \nemployees,  suppliers,  and  contractors.  Many  farmers  are  expected  to  benefit  through \nparticipation  in  structured  arrangements  for  supplying  agro-industrial  raw  materials.  Project \nimpacts will be direct for agribusinesses that participate in partnerships to grow their businesses \nand  create  market  and  employment  opportunities  for  other  beneficiaries.  The  impacts  will  be \nindirect  but  significant  for  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  with  likely  cumulative  medium-term \nbenefits  such  as  increasing  market  opportunities  to  grow  and  sell  produce,  and  increasing \nopportunities for formal employment in agro-industries.  \n \n31. \nThe economic analysis shows that the economic internal rate of return would be about \n21%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the overall project is relatively robust to changes in \nthe level of costs and benefits. In general, the economic internal rate of return is more sensitive \nto delays in benefits rather than costs and benefits being greater or lesser than expected, with \nthe  overall  project  return  falling  just  below  12%  if  benefits  are  delayed  a  year.  The  economic \nanalysis indicates that the benefits justify the costs of the overall investment project. All project \ncomponents  are  necessary  for  delivering  the  expected  results  through  mutual  reinforcement, \nand none of them can be considered a stand-alone investment.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n32. \nThe project features important design elements to support good governance and ensure \naccountability  and  transparency  by  implementing  the  project  within  the  ESMS  framework  in \ncoordination  with  participating  banks  and  the  FM,  and  by  adopting  well-defined  (i)  beneficiary \neligibility  and  assessment  criteria;  (ii)  subproject  eligibility  and  finance  criteria;  and  (iii) \nprocesses  and  procedures  for  FIs\u2019  use  of  cash  collateral  mechanism  and  SSC,  including \nprocesses for borrower default. These criteria will be documented in the legal agreements and \nthe  PAM.  The  MOF\u2019s  financial  management  capacity,  policies,  and  procedures  as  well  as  its \nprocurement  capacity  have  been  assessed  as  satisfactory. 31 The  FIs  will  be  encouraged  to \nrequire  subborrowers  to  use  economic  and  efficient  private  sector  or  commercial  practices  in \nprocurement. The PAM will be adhered to during implementation.  \n \n                                                \n30 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  In accordance with: ADB. 2005.

Besides  formal  job  creation \nwithin  the  sector,  the  project  will  address  poverty  reduction  by  engaging  many  low-income \nfarmers. The project will comply with national labor laws and/or internationally recognized core \nlabor standards. The PMU will establish a monitoring system to track these indicators.32  \n \nThe project is classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d A gender action plan was \n35. \ndeveloped  based  on  gender  analysis  and  stakeholder  consultations.  In  the  formal  economy, \nwomen  are  active  participants  in  the  private  sector,  primarily  as  paid  employees.  A  small \nnumber  of  women  are  employed  by  agribusinesses.33 The  gender  action  plan  provides  for  the \nequitable participation of women in the project by ensuring that (i) businesses run by women will \nbe  considered  for  financing  based  on  a  commercially  viable  business  plan,  (ii)  women  benefit \nfrom training activities to improve technical skills in business management and other areas, (iii) \nwomen  gain  from  increased  formal  employment  opportunities  in  agribusinesses,  and  (iv)  the \nproject is managed and monitored with sensitivity to gender outcomes.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment. The project has been classified as category FI following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \n36. \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  The  ESMS  of  the  likely  participating  bank  has  been  assessed  and \nfound  acceptable.  An  ESMS  was  prepared  for  the  project  since  the  specific  enterprises  to  be \nsupported  by  the  project  are  unknown  at  this  stage.  Activities  to  be  undertaken  by  partner \ncompanies under the project will be subject to environmental and social safeguard screening by \nthe  FIs  and,  if  required,  assessment  during  evaluation  of  partnership  proposals  following  the \nESMS.  The  ESMS  establishes  the  process  for  compliance  with  safeguards  and  includes  the \nmonitoring  and  reporting  requirements.  A  safeguard  specialist,  who  will  assist  the  FM,  will  be \nengaged to work with potential partners.  \n  \n37. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (IR)  and  indigenous  peoples  (IP).  The project is classified \ncategory  FI  (treated  as  C)  for  IR  and  IP  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nThe project is not expected to involve physical displacement or involuntary acquisition of land. \nAny purchase or lease of freehold land or leasing of customary land for agricultural production \nwill be undertaken through voluntary agreements between private agribusiness enterprises and \nlandowners. The project is not expected to impact any distinct and vulnerable group of IP. The \nbeneficiaries in the project areas are part of mainstream Polynesian society. The outputs will be \nculturally  appropriate. While the  location  of  agribusinesses  to  be  supported  is  unknown  at  this \nstage, the project\u2019s ESMS provides guidelines for screening and managing any unanticipated IP \nand IR impacts. The project will be treated as category C for IP and IR, and no activities will be \nundertaken that have any IR and/or adverse impact on distinct and vulnerable IP. \n\n                                                \n32  Procedures for monitoring the participation of poor and disadvantaged households will be detailed in the PAM and \n\nwill become part of the project monitoring and evaluation system. \n\n33  According to traditional Samoan values, women do not play a direct role in agricultural production, which is defined \nas a masculine activity. Increased employment or self-employment in agricultural production is therefore likely to be \nmainly male. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe  project  risks  have  been  assessed  and  the  benefits  are  expected  to  outweigh  the \ncosts. The project is considered complex because of the agriculture focus and  the challenging \nsmall  island  context,  which  justified  the  modified  FI  channel  modality.  Efforts  have  been \nundertaken to identify potential risks and relevant mitigating measures, which are integrated into \nthe project design. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and detailed \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nAdverse weather or natural disasters disrupt raw material \nsupplies.  \n\nMalpractice or poor business performance of partner \ncompanies undermines commercial viability \n\nInconsistent raw material supply disrupts business process \n\nNon repayment of loan due to poor business performance \n\nDifficulty in securing suitably qualified and/or experienced \nfacility manager \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nto  support, \n\nMitigating Measures \nBusiness plan to take account of possible disruptions, \nseparate  regional  technical  assistance  to  support  on \nthose aspects. \nCareful  due  diligence  and  assessment  of  business \nplan  prior \ntailored  business  support \nservices and ongoing monitoring of facility manager. \nCareful  constraints  analysis  during  due  diligence \nin  contractual  arrangements \nprocess.
