SAL will procure potatoes under contract \nfarming arrangements and provide secure income to 2,000 smallholder farmers. Given the high \npoverty reduction impact at farming and factory levels, the project will promote inclusive business. \nADB engaged with SAL to achieve effective gender mainstreaming in the project. SAL will commit \nto a gender action plan (GAP), an improvement over ADB\u2019s first financing to SAL which included \nonly  one gender target. The  project  is  also fully  aligned with the  Government of  Bangladesh\u2019s \ngoals to enhance agricultural productivity, increase local value addition, and create jobs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject  identification.  Agricultural  development  is  crucial  to  eradicating  poverty  and \ncreating  conditions  for  sustainable  and  equitable  growth  in  Asia,  where  a  large  proportion  of \npeople still rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Empirical studies have shown that agricultural \ninvestment is one of the most effective and least-cost strategies to reduce poverty and hunger.2  \n \nBangladesh  remains  an  agrarian  economy,  with  agriculture  providing  nearly  half  of  all \n4. \nemployment and supporting more than 70% of the population.3 While its share in gross domestic \nproduct dropped to 15% in 2017, agriculture still constitutes the main source of income and food \nsecurity for most Bangladeshis, particularly the poorest.  \n\n \n5. \nAgriculture  in Bangladesh is plagued  by  issues  such  as  being highly  unorganized,  with \nfragmented landholdings and inefficient value chains. Consequently, value addition in the sector \nremains extremely low\u2014leading to substantial post-harvest losses and a high degree of reliance \non  intermediaries  for  farmers.  This  is  exacerbated  by  lack  of  access  to  good  quality  inputs, \nfinance, extension services, and other infrastructure  on small farms, which leads to low yields. \nThis continues to prohibit farmers from accessing markets. \n \nTo  increase  value  addition  in  the  sector,  develop  commercial  agriculture,  and  connect \n6. \nfarmers  to  markets,  private  sector  investment  is  critical.  Formal  value  chains  are  typically \ndeveloped by corporate buyers, who integrate vertically to source directly from the farm gate, to \nsecure long-term access to quality products. Contract farming is one such tool whereby the private \nsector  can  help  farmers  obtain  access  to  quality  inputs,  best  agronomic  practices,  and  most \nimportantly provide a direct market linkage, making the value chain more efficient.  \n  \n\n                                                \n1   The  first  PRAN  Agribusiness  Project  was  approved  in  2012  (ADB.  2012.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Sylvan Agriculture Limited for the PRAN Agribusiness Project \nin Bangladesh. Manila). SAL and ADB signed a $25.1 million loan in 2012 and $4.8 million was outstanding as of 30 \nJune 2018.  \n\n2  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations,  World  Food  Programme,  and  International  Fund  for \n\nAgricultural Development. 2012.

SAL was incorporated in 2012 when \nPRAN wanted to undertake manufacturing of (i) starch and liquid glucose, (ii) flour, and (iii) frozen \nfood products. SAL applied for ADB assistance to finance the construction and operation of three \nnew facilities for these products, although the project scope was later changed to include only \nstarch  and  liquid  glucose.  For  its  starch  and  liquid  glucose  production,  SAL  initiated  contract \nfarming with cassava farmers to procure raw material. As of 2018, about 2,500 cassava farmers \nsupply SAL directly for its operations. Given ADB\u2019s association with SAL, PRAN approached ADB \nto finance SAL\u2019s current expansion to pasta production and potato processing, for which SAL will \ncontinue to procure from contract farmers.   \n \n8. \nProject design. The project will support the construction of a manufacturing plant and the \npurchase  of  machinery  and  equipment  to  produce  potato chips,  potato flakes,  and  pasta.  The \nplant will be located in Habiganj Industrial Park, in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh, where \nthe  starch  and  liquid  glucose  plant  is  also  located.  The  project  will  promote  inclusive  and \nsustainable agricultural value chains with higher local value addition of farm produce. \n \n9. \nThe project will source potatoes from 2,000 contract farmers. Most of the farmers will be \nfrom the Dinajpur district, in the northern part of Bangladesh. SAL will enable farmers\u2019 access to \na high-yielding and higher-value variety, especially suited for processing,4 helping them to move \nfrom low-income-generating subsistence crops to commercial agriculture (cash crops). SAL has \nabout  20  field  staff  to  advise  and  train  farmers  on  best  agronomic  practices  and  guide  them \nthrough the agricultural production process. Farmers also get access to agricultural inputs such \nas  fertilizers  and  pesticides  to  grow  potatoes  of  good  quality. 5  SAL  will  adjust  the  cost  of \nagricultural inputs, which are provided on credit at the time of sowing, against the total amount \npayable. As part of the contract arrangements, SAL will provide a buy-back guarantee based on \nthe market price, providing the farmers with a guaranteed source of income.  \n\n \nPotato farmers engaged with SAL are expected to benefit from increasing income levels, \n\nThe project will add value to local farm produce and boost the local agribusiness industry \n\n10. \nas in the case of cassava farmers. \n \n11. \nwith the new food processing facilities.  \n \nSponsor.

The project will contribute to at least three of the government\u2019s priorities for the \nagriculture  sector  in  Bangladesh,  as  stated  in  the  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan,  FY2016\u2212FY2020.7 \nThese include (i) facilitating increased private sector investments in agriculture and improving the \nagro-processing value chains; (ii) linking farm produce with the market to overcome the issue of \nlow prices of products at the farm, low investment in agriculture, and inadequate credit support to \nfarmers; and (iii) shifting, where feasible, to higher-value crops for commercialization. \n \n18. \nThe Seventh Five Year Plan stresses the need to build capacity in agriculture to ensure \nremunerative prices for produce, both to maximize rural income-generating opportunities and to \noptimize the use of limited natural resources. The plan also calls for small and marginal farmers \nto be supported in selling their products by developing linkages with domestic and international \nmarkets. The project achieves this impact through its contract farming feature, which will ensure \nthat farmers are offered ready market access toward a stable income opportunity. \n \n19. \nOutcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the increased production of potato chips, potato \nflakes,  and  pasta,  leading  to  improved  rural  livelihoods.  The  project  will  effectively  promote \ninclusive  growth,  as  potatoes  will  be  directly  sourced  from  2,000  contract  farmers.  It  will  also \ncreate direct employment for about 450 people, at least 50% of whom will be female. New factory \nworkers will benefit from well-paid jobs, as in existing SAL facilities.8  \n \n20. \n \nC. \n\nOutput. The project\u2019s output will be the food processing plant completed and operational. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations   \n \n21. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  Strategy  2030  identified \npromoting rural development and food security by supporting agriculture (improving value chain \nlinkages; and increasing agricultural productivity, food security, and food safety) as one of the key \noperational  priorities  linking  ADB  operations  to  inclusive  growth. 9  The  proposed  project  is \nconsistent  with  this  strategy  as  it  (i)  supports  the  development  of  agricultural  value  chains \nconnecting  agricultural  production  to  food  processing;  and  (ii) increases  productivity  by \nintroducing  new  higher-yielding  crop  varieties,  which  lead  to  increased  incomes  for  farmers. \nStrategy  2030  also  calls  for  support  to  inclusive  business  models.  The  project  will  provide \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2003.

Therefore, the project is classified as inclusive business (para. 31).  \n \n22. \nThe  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  for  Bangladesh  identified  improving  rural \nlivelihoods by increasing the productivity of agriculture as among the priority investment areas for \nprojects since agriculture provides nearly half of all employment and supports more than 70% of \nthe population (footnote 2). It also stated that ADB will continue to provide financial assistance to \nprivate sector projects with sound fundamentals and strong development impact. \n\n \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n23. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources as it supports agribusiness \ninvestment  and  value  chain  development  including  production,  processing,  distribution,  and \nconsumption.10 The plan states that investments in agriculture and natural resources are essential \nto  promoting  inclusive  growth,  reducing  poverty,  and  promoting  environmental  stability.  It  also \nmentions that the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) will continue to be among those \nentities responsible for implementing the plan. The project has met the key elements for PSOD \ninvestments  as  identified  in  the  plan,  which are  strong sponsors from  a  credit  perspective and \nbest practices for implementation. The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s sovereign operations \nin Bangladesh. The ADB South Asia Department has a proposed pipeline project of $100 million \nin  2020  for  a  water  project  with  an  agricultural  value  chain  component  to  assist  farmers  to \nstrengthen production. To prepare this project, a transaction technical assistance (TA) project in \n2019 will explore opportunities to engage agribusinesses using contract farming models (such as \nPRAN) and to invest in related rural infrastructure and post-harvest facilities. \n \nD. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nE. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nF. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nG. \n \n24. \nThe project is ADB\u2019s first repeat nonsovereign assistance to a borrower in the agribusiness \nspace.  Given  the  high  poverty  reduction  impact  at  the  contract  farming  and  factory  levels,  as \nvalidated by the independent poverty impact assessment,11 the project is classified as inclusive \nbusiness. The project will create 450 well-paid factory jobs (footnote 8) in the Habiganj district, \nwhere the share of households living below poverty threshold (poverty rate) is 25%. The project \nwill also boost the income of 2,000 contract farmers (para. 10) and provide livelihood opportunities \nto 24,000 temporary laborers in the Dinajpur district, where poverty rate is 38%.12  \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2015.
