The project \nwill  be  a  model  for  integrated  rural\u2013urban  development,  by  supporting  towns  and  bringing \nservices  closer  to  people;  combining  flood  risk  management  and  environmentally  sustainable \nriver  rehabilitation, \ntransport;  and \ndeveloping institutional capacity to ensure project sustainability.2 \n \n\nimproved  wastewater  management,  and  rural\u2013urban \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nPingxiang is a poverty-stricken, resource-depleted, mountainous city with a population of \n1.87 million and an area of 3,827 square kilometers. The city is (i) in the western portion of the \npoor, flood disaster-stricken Jiangxi Province; (ii) 70 kilometers (km) east of the Chang-Zhu-Tan \ncity-cluster;  and  (iii)  connected  to  national  highways  and  to  the  high-speed  rail  network. 3 \nDevelopment in Pingxiang has lagged significantly behind national averages and was chosen as \none  of  12  cities  nationwide  to  showcase  industrial  transformation, from  an  economy  based  on \nresource  extraction  to  one  that  is  more  diverse. 4 Pingxiang  experiences  serious  floods  and \nenvironmental pollution, and was chosen to become a pilot city for climate-proof, \u201csponge\u201d city \ndevelopment.5 Pingxiang\u2019s  urbanization  ratio  is  low  and  rural  poverty  is  high,  and  the  city  was \nchosen to implement an innovative approach to rural\u2013urban integration in Jiangxi Province, one \nthat delivers infrastructure and jobs in closer proximity to rural residents. 6 \n \n4. \nThe  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  in  Pingxiang\u2019s  counties  is  about  half  that  in  the \nurban core, which is in turn about half that of nearby Changsha.7 Lianhua is a national poverty \ncounty,  and  there  are  113  designated  poverty  villages  in  the  municipality.  The  Pingxiang \nmunicipal  government  (PMG)  Resource-Depleted  Transitional  Development  Plan  (2013\u20132020) \npromotes  balanced  and  sustainable  urban\u2013rural  development  and  aims  to  (i)  expand  and  link \nthe  centers  of  Anyuan  and  Xiangdong  districts,  with  an  expected  combined  population  of \n800,000  by  2020;  and  (ii)  strengthen  county-level  cities  as  subcenters  in  Lianhua,  Luxi,  and \nShangli counties, with a population of 70,000\u2013120,000 residents in each by 2020. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance:  ADB.  2013.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Jiangxi  Pingxiang  Integrated  Rural\u2013Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project. Manila (TA 8451-PRC). \n\n3  Jiangxi is a key source province of floating migrant worker population to the eastern PRC. Chang-Zhu-Tan is an \nabbreviation for the Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan city cluster. In 2007, the National Development and Reform \nCommission approved the city cluster as pilot for integration of resource efficient and sustainable development. \n4  Pingxiang  was  among  12  cities  in  the  PRC  to  be classified  as  resource-depleted  city,  and  is  eligible  for  national \ngovernment  support  for  industrial  transformation.  Pingxiang  depends  on  resource-based  industries  such  as  coal \nand  iron  mining,  steel,  aluminum,  industrial  ceramics,  chemical,  and  fireworks.  Agriculture  remains  important, \nespecially in Lianhua County. \n\n5  Sponge city is a concept in which greenways, parks, and wetlands maximize ecosystem services, including water \nresource  management  and  stormwater  retention.  In  April  2015,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  Urban  and  Rural \nDevelopment announced that Pingxiang was selected as one of 16 pilot cities for the sponge city program. \n6  The urbanization ratio (31.6%) is lower than the national average (53.7%); rural poverty is significant at 18.6%. \n7  In 2011, Pingxiang\u2019s average urban income was CNY18,646, compared with a national average of CNY21,810. \n\n\f2 \n\nFlood  risk-reduction  is  a  top  priority  in  Pingxiang.  Flood  frequency  and  severity  have \n5. \nincreased significantly since 1998. Floods in 1998, 2001, 2002, 2010, and 2014 affected more \nthan 496,000 people, caused the collapse of more than 2,600 houses, and resulted in significant \neconomic losses in agriculture. A major flood on 25 May 2014 severely impacted public safety \nand  health,  and  caused  an  estimated  $115  million  in  economic  losses. 8 Most  riverbanks  in \nPingxiang have inadequate flood protection; sediment accumulation from riverbank erosion and \nmining has raised riverbeds, further reducing the flood discharge capacity of rivers. \n \nPingxiang  is  a  headwater municipality;  all  its  rivers  originate  in the mountainous  areas, \n6. \nand flow into two river systems: (i) the Gan River, which drains northeast into Poyang Lake; and \n(ii)  the  Xiang  River,  which  flows  northwest  into  Dongting  Lake.  Where  rivers  flow  through \nfarmland, settlements, and industrial and mining areas they collect pollutants and sediments. At \nthe end of 2012, the urban wastewater treatment rate in Pingxiang was 75.8%, well below the \nnational average. Many small cities and townships lack or have incomplete sewer systems, and \nno  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs).  Domestic  wastewater  is  discharged  untreated  into \nrivers,  affecting  downstream jurisdictions  and  Poyang  Lake.9 Illegal  solid  waste  disposal  along \nrivers is common, particularly in rural areas without regular collection. Some rivers in Pingxiang \nprovide drinking water for local communities, and pollution poses serious risks to public health.10 \n \n7. \nPingxiang\u2019s  rural  areas  have  limited  access  to  markets,  jobs,  training,  education,  and \nservices  in  towns  and  cities.  The  lack  of  adequate  roads  and  public  transport  limits  rural \ndevelopment, jobs, and livelihood opportunities. Except for the main east\u2013west and north\u2013south \ncorridors served by highways and national roads, many existing roads in Pingxiang are narrow \nand poorly maintained, particularly in the rural and mountainous areas. \n \nPingxiang  is  focused  on  developing  its  core  urban  area,  with  less  priority  given  to  the \n8. \ndevelopment of rural areas. Continued unbalanced and disconnected development will result in \nan  increasing  social,  economic,  and  environmental  divide  between  urban  and  rural  areas. \nPingxiang  is  approaching  its  challenges  with  non-integrated  engineering,  which  addresses \nproblems  from  one  dimension,  while  typically  generating  new  problems  in  other  areas.  Non-\nintegrated  approaches  to  flood  protection\u2014which  typically  comprise  solid  walls  and  concrete \ndikes\u2014force  stormwater  into  a  channel,  potentially  causing  downstream  flash  floods  and \ndegrading  river  environments;  this  harms  river  ecology,  and  the  lack  of  natural  capacity  to \nabsorb rainwater runoff that flows into rivers necessitates increased investment compared with \nan integrated approach that strategically preserve floodplains. \n \n9. \nStrategic fit. The project supports the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) and the \nPRC\u2019s  National  New-Type  Urbanization  Plan  (2014\u20132020)  by  contributing  to  balanced \nurbanization with livable, eco-efficient, and inclusive cities; and Pingxiang\u2019s development, flood \nrisk  management,  and  transportation  plans. 11  The  project  (i)  is  aligned  with  the  country \npartnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);  (ii)  is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2015\u20132017  for  the  PRC;  (iii)  supports \nADB\u2019s  (a)  Strategy  2020  goal  of  livable  and  sustainable  cities  through creation  of cleaner  and \nhealthier environments; (b) urban operational plan that aims at inclusive, green, and competitive \nintegrated  water  resources \nurban  development;  (c)  water  operational  plan  aiming  at \n\n                                                \n8  During the rainy season in April\u2013June, flood events have a duration of several days. Water levels rise by up to four \n\nmeters above normal levels for a 20-year flood (one that is likely to occur once every 20 years). \n\n9  The PRC categorizes surface water quality into five classes: from I (best) to V (worst). Classes I\u2013III can be used for \n\ndrinking water. Most project rivers currently do not meet class III. \n\n10 Water  safety  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  PMG  and  county  and/or  district  governments,  and  identify  water \nsafety risks. Risks in the project rivers will be addressed by the loan using structural and nonstructural measures. \n\n11 This plan will serve as a blueprint for urbanization policies in the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan. \n\n\f3 \n\nin \n\nflood \n\nmanagement; and (d) sustainable transport initiative operational plan in its objective to support \nrural roads; and (iv) provides innovative solutions as emphasized in ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020,  complementing  physical  with  nonstructural  measures \nrisk \nmanagement.12  \n \n10. \nIncorporation  of lessons. The project incorporates lessons from similar ADB loan and \ntechnical assistance projects in the PRC and in Jiangxi Province.13 Lessons include (i) planning \nwastewater  facilities  that  follow  rigorous  demand  analysis,  and  conducting  policy  dialogue  on \ncost recovery to support investment sustainability; (ii) reducing adverse impacts on rural roads \nthrough road and pedestrian safety, intersection design improvement, and public transport; and \n(iii) reducing resettlement impact and cost through optimization of project design.14 \n \nPilot  features.  The  project  includes  best  practices  and  pilot  demonstration  features. \n11. \nBest  practices  include  (i)  linking  and  functionally  integrating  infrastructure  to  optimize \ndevelopment impacts, including river, wastewater, and road components; (ii) implementation of \nnational  regulations  on  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  (promulgated  by  the  government  and \nprepared  with  ADB  assistance)  established  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \nparticipation  (as  regulations  require  full  cost  recovery),  mainly  for  the  water  supply  sector  in \nPingxiang;15 and  (iii)  road  alignment  optimization  through  the  study  of  alternatives  to  minimize \nand balance resettlement and environmental impacts. Pilot demonstration features include: \n\n(i)  \n\nUrban\u2013rural  flood  risk  management  and  climate  resilience  partnerships. \nRiver  embankments, floodplain  preservation,  and  adaptable  weirs  protect  urban \nand rural settlements, while ensuring the irrigation needs of farmers are met. As \nrecommended  in  the  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment,  small  concrete \ndams  will  be reconstructed  as  adjustable  hydraulic  tilting gate  weirs to  enhance \n16 During  project \nclimate  variability  and  change  adaptation  capacity.\nimplementation,  nonstructural  climate  adaptation  measures  (i.e.,  improved  river \nmaintenance,  flood  monitoring,  early  warning,  and  disaster  response  systems) \nwill be implemented.17 A water resource management plan will be developed and \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2012.

A project-\nlevel  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  confirmed  that  design  assumptions  for  flood  control  works  were \nadequate. River embankments have a safety buffer freeboard of 0.5\u20130.7 meters that can accommodate projected \nincreases in precipitation resulting from climate change until at least 2050. \n\n17 Counties and districts have fairly effective flood information systems. In Luxi County, short messages are sent to all \n\nresidents\u2019 mobile phones to warn of flood events. \n\n\f4 \n\n(ii)  \n\nfarmers  will  be  trained  in  advanced  crop  production  that  is  more  flood-resilient, \nand will likely increase their incomes.18  \nEcological  river  management  supporting  sustainable  urban\u2013rural  sponge \ncity  development.  Replanted \nrural  agricultural \nshelterbelts, protection of wetland floodplains, and public green space along the \nriver  will  accommodate  seasonal  water \nincrease \nstormwater  retention  capacity.  The  ecologically  designed  greenways  will \nenhance  habitat  biodiversity  and  water  quality  through  filtration  by  green  buffer \nzones. Implementation of water safety plans through capacity building and policy \ndialogue on pollution reduction will further enhance sustainability.19 \n\nriparian  embankments, \n\nfluctuations  and \n\nlevel \n\n(iii)   Community-based  environment  supervision  and  roads  safety  education \nteams  (CERTs).  They  will  develop  and  implement  community  environment \nmanagement  rules  to  foster  environmentally  sustainable  behavior,  including \norderly solid waste disposal. CERTs will also facilitate community-awareness on \nroad  safety  and  maintenance  and  discuss  public  transportation  and  bus  stop \nlocations with the government in the areas adjacent to the rural\u2013urban road.20  \n\n \nImpacts and Outcome \n\nB. \n \n12. \nThe  impacts  will  be  improved  integrated  and  green  urban\u2013rural  development;  and \nimproved  socioeconomic  wellbeing  of  residents  in  cities,  townships,  and  villages  in  Pingxiang \nmunicipality  and  Jiangxi  Province.  The  outcome will  be  improved  living  conditions  of rural  and \nurban residents using integrated infrastructure in Pingxiang. \n \nResponding  to  the  need  of  an  integrated  approach,  the  project  will  address  key \n13. \nchallenges of flooding, river pollution, untreated wastewater, and lack of rural\u2013urban linkages in \na connected and holistic manner. It will contribute to more sustainable and inclusive urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment in Pingxiang by strategically focusing investments on four subcenters in Lianhua, \nLuxi,  and  Shangli  counties,  and  Xiangdong  District;  and  on  two  key  townships  in  Luxi  and \nShangli counties. It will  promote a more distributed urban\u2013rural system to support government \nplans  and  recent  growth  of  these  cities.21 The  strengthened  subcenters  will  bring  jobs,  goods, \nassets,  and  public  and  private  services  within  the  commuting  distance  of  more  villages  and \ntownships, enabling more inclusive growth.22 The project will increase flood resilience, enhance \nthe river environment, and improve wastewater management. A total of about 308,000 farmers \nand  rural  and  urban  residents  will  benefit  directly  from  reduced  flood  risk.  The  improved  river \nenvironment  will  include  recreational  and  public  health  benefits  of  accessible,  continuous,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable greenways linking urban and rural areas in the four subcenters, and \nserving  about  400,000  residents  by  2020.  About  175,000  residents  will  benefit  directly  from \nexpanded  and  improved  wastewater  management  services.  Additional  benefits  include \nimproved  quality  of  life,  increased  real  estate  values,  and  reduced  expenses  and  risks  from \nfloods and waterborne diseases. Also, the project will reduce pollutants entering the Xiang and \nGan  river  systems.  The  rural\u2013urban  road  will  support  inclusive  development  by  connecting \nvillages,  townships,  subcenters,  schools,  and  industrial  areas  in  the  two  fastest-growing \n                                                \n18 Additional income for farmers will be promoted through value-added activities in food processing and agri-tourism. \n19 Water  safety  plans  were  developed  during  project  preparation  for  Lianhua  and  Shangli  counties,  where  project \n\nrivers serve as drinking water sources. The project will implement measures to reduce water safety risks. \n\n20 Details  are  in  the  procurement  and  consulting  services  section  and  in  the  social  development  action  plan  of  the \n\nProject Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21 Average annual urban growth rates were very high in Lianhua (9.7%), Luxi (7.8%), and Shangli (15.8%), but lower \n\nin Anyuan and Xiangdong districts (2.7% combined). \n\n22 One challenge of urban\u2013rural integration (including in Pingxiang) is the separation of families. Elderly people and \n\nchildren remain in villages, while working-age people live and work in urban areas. \n\n\f5 \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  takes  a  strategic  and  holistic  approach,  with  four  key  outputs  covering  all \n\ncounties of Luxi and Shangli, directly benefitting about 247,000 residents. The subcomponents \nare spatially and functionally linked to maximize mutual benefits and development impact. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nrural counties and urban districts within Pingxiang municipality. \n \n15. \nOutput 1: Flood risk management and river rehabilitation improved and integrated. \nThis  component  comprises  works  on  71  km  of  eight  rural\u2013urban  rivers  in  Lianhua,  Luxi,  and \nShangli counties; and Xiangdong District including (i) river widening and removal of sediments, \n(ii) new and rehabilitated embankments, (iii) about 90 hectares (ha) of riparian revegetation, (iv) \nabout  46  ha  of  wetland  protection  and  rehabilitation,  (v)  construction  or  reconstruction  of  35 \nsmall adaptable weirs for farmland irrigation, and (vi) construction of two new pedestrian bridges \n(Lianhua  and  Luxi)  and  reconstruction  of  one  local  bridge  (Luxi).

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years; follow  the  straight-line  repayment method;  and  have  an  annual  interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft  loan  and  project  agreements.26 The  loan  will  finance  civil  works  (94%),  equipment  (4%), \ncapacity development (2%), and other eligible expenditures. The local governments will finance \nthe  balance  of  costs  not  financed  by  ADB,  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  cost, \ndesign,  site  supervision,  and  management  cost.  The  PRC  Ministry  of  Finance  will  relend  the \nentire  loan  to  Jiangxi  provincial  government,  which  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds to the  PMG, \nwhich will onlend to the county and district governments on the same terms and conditions as \nthe ADB loan.

WWTP \nprocesses  have  been  selected considering  the  limited  capacity for  operation  and maintenance \n(O&M).  Sensitivity  analysis  of  flood  control  components  shows  that  design  assumptions  and \nproposed  structures  are  adequate  to  accommodate  increased  precipitation  (based  on  climate \nchange forecasting). \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic analysis. The economic analysis indicates the project is economically viable, \nwith an overall economic internal rate of return of 17.8% and an economic net present value of \nCNY704 million. The rates of return for the individual outputs are 18.6% for the river component, \n12.4%  for  improved  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  and  18.8%  for  the  rural\u2013urban  road. \nThe  wastewater  subcomponent  in  Lianhua  County,  a  designated  national  poverty  county,  has \nan economic internal rate of return of 9.7%, lower than the economic opportunity cost of capital \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\nof  12%.  Actual  benefits  are  likely  larger  as  several  were  not  quantified  (e.g.,  public  health, \necosystems services, and others). Sensitivity analysis shows that project viability can withstand \npotential variations in costs and benefits. The project remains economically viable even with a \ncombination of a benefit decline of 20.0% and a capital cost increase of 20.0%. \n \n25. \nFinancial analysis. The financial sustainability assessment for the project indicated that \nthe  local  governments  have  sufficient  funds  to  finance  the  counterpart  contributions  and  to \nfinance  debt  service  and  O&M  costs  during  operation.  Average  annual  counterpart  funding \naccounts for 1.1% of projected local government revenues during implementation. Annual debt \nservice  ranges  from  1.0%  to  3.2%  of  projected  revenues  in  2021.  Annual  funds  required  for \nfacility  O&M  averages  less  than  1%  of  projected  revenues  during  the  operational  period. \nFinancial  evaluation  of  the  two  WWTPs  determined  that  full  cost  recovery  is  not  possible  at \nreasonable  tariff  assumptions, given  the  small  scale  of  the WWTPs. However,  the  wastewater \ntariff can provide full recovery of O&M costs. The operating margin (estimated based on current \ntariff  levels  and  full  O&M  cost  recovery)  is  16%  for  Tongmu  WWTP  and  22%  for  Xuanfeng \nWWTP. This component will generate a positive operating margin even under a stress scenario \n(10% reduction in tariff revenue and 5% increase in O&M cost). \n \nC. \n \nBased  on  the  financial  management  assessment,  key  financial  management  risks \n26. \nidentified are lack of knowledge of ADB financial management policies and procedures, lack of \nstandardized procedures, and inadequate budget planning processes for project implementation. \nGiven  the  participation  of  counties  and  districts,  it  is  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk of executing and implementing agencies is moderate. To address the \nrisks, key mitigating measures include training of relevant staff on procurement, disbursement, \nand  financial  reporting  requirements  prior  to  loan  effectiveness;  and  development  of  manuals. \nWith \nfinancial  management  arrangements  are  deemed  adequate.  A \nprocurement  risk  assessment  of  PMG  and  the  project  management  office  confirmed  that \ncapacity  is  adequate  given  assistance  by  a  procurement  agency  to  prepare  and  arrange  all \nprocurement  activities  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s  domestic  rules,  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with PMG and county and district governments. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe project will (i) contribute to poverty reduction by reducing flood risk for a population \nof  about  308,000,  including  about  37,000  poor  people;  (ii)  provide  improved  wastewater \nservices for  175,000 residents;  and  (iii)  directly  benefit  247,000  people residing  within  2 km of \nthe rural\u2013urban road. It is estimated that a total of more than 4,600 jobs will be created by the \nproject  during  construction,  with  200 \njobs  during  operation.  The  PMG  and  project \nimplementation units will ensure that all PRC labor laws and core labor standards are followed. \n \n28. \nA social development action plan was prepared for the project to ensure participation of \ncommunities in project design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Actions include \n(i)  participation  in  public  awareness  campaigns  on  the  disaster  preparedness  system  and \nenvironmental  and  public  health  education;  (ii)  consultation  and  information  disclosure  on \nWWTPs, sludge disposal, and transportation; (iii) participation in public hearings on wastewater \ntariffs; (iv) targets for employment of local labor, women, and the poor during construction and \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nthese  measures, \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\noperation;  and  (v)  establishment  of  CERTs  to  design  and  implement  awareness-raising \ncampaigns and education programs. Social and gender indicators will be included in the project \nperformance  management  system,  and  adequate  consultant  inputs  for  implementation  and \nmonitoring are included in the loan implementation consultant package. \n \n29. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Women strongly support \nthe  project  and  expect  improvement  of  the  environment,  their  quality  of  life,  and  employment \nand  income  opportunities.  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared,  including  specific  targets  for \nwomen  in  employment,  participation,  and  decision-making. 28 The  plan  will  help  to  ensure  (i) \nincreased  opportunities  for  female  employment  (at  least  30%),  (ii)  participation  and  gender-\nsensitive awareness campaigns and education programs on disaster preparedness system and \npublic road safety with up to 50% female participation, (iii) participation in decision-making and \ncapacity-building  activities  through  the  establishment  of  CERTs  (30%  female  members)  and \ncommunity-based  groups  (50%  female  members),  (iv)  sex-disaggregated  data  collection,  and \n(v) implementation and monitoring of the gender action plan indicators. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  A  project  environmental  impact  assessment,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared  and  disclosed  in  May  2015  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s policies and requirements, including ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  The  environmental  impact  assessment  incorporates  findings  from  a  biodiversity  and \nhabitat  survey  and  fishery  resource  impact  assessments  in  the  Pingshui  and  Yuan  rivers. \nPotential  impacts  of the planned  river  rehabilitation  include  significant  earthwork  and  sediment \ndredging,  and  damage  to  in-channel  habitats  potentially  impacting  the  two  fish  protection \nzones.29 The  proposed  rural\u2013urban  road  will  involve  cut  and  fill  along  the  road  corridor,  which \nwill  likely  cause  soil  erosion,  dust,  construction  noise  and  vibration,  and  community  and \noccupational  health  and  safety  risks.  Most  impacts  will  be  localized,  short-term,  and  can  be \neffectively  mitigated  through  the  application  of  good  construction  and  housekeeping  practices \ndefined  in  the  EMP.  An  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  program  is  defined  in \nthe EMP to ensure PMG\u2019s capacity to manage and monitor environmental impacts and risks.  \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  will  acquire  171.02  ha  of  land,  of \n31. \nwhich  115.61  ha  is  farmland,  affecting  3,379  households  with  13,672  persons.  There  will  be \ntemporary occupation of 122.53 ha of land. About 262 households and 1,022 persons will lose \n51,636.57 square meters of residential housing and 3,309 square meters of small shops. A total \nof  4,207  households  with  17,045  persons  will  be  affected  by  the  project,  out  of  which  1,059 \nhouseholds with 4,327 persons will lose more than 10% of their productive assets and/or will be \nphysically displaced. Nearly 325 households with 395 persons are vulnerable and 13 belong to \nethnic groups. Five resettlement plans consistent with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement were \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website. Compensation for lost assets and allowances will \nbe  at  replacement  costs  and  will  be  paid  to  affected  persons  prior  to  displacement. \nResettlement  information  booklets  were  disclosed  to  the  community,  village  offices,  and  to \naffected persons in the local language in April 2015. Each project implementation unit will have \nat least one fulltime resettlement staff member to carry out internal monitoring and supervision. \nThe  implementing  agencies  possess  good  capacity  to  implement  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Training on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and procedures will be provided \nto  ensure  proper  implementation.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  and  an \nindependent agency will be engaged to conduct semiannual external monitoring and evaluation. \n                                                \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Approximately 3.55 million m3 of soil will be excavated during rehabilitation of the project rivers. \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
