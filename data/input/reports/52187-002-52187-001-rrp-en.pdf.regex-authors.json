I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nof up to $25,000,000 or its lari equivalent to Credo Bank JSC (Credo) for Low-Income Housing \nFinance; and (ii) a proposed loan of the lari equivalent of up to $100,000,000 to TBC Bank JSC \n(TBC) for Affordable Mortgage Finance, each, in Georgia. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) to Credo for Enhancing Rural Financial Inclusion for Women in Georgia, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan to Credo, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.  \n \n2.  The transactions entail the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-term financing \nin lari or United States (US) dollars to Credo and in lari to TBC to support affordable long-term \nhousing  and  mortgage  finance.  While  Credo  will  focus  on  funding  home  renovation  and \nconstruction in rural areas and the periphery of the capital targeting low-income clients, TBC will \nprovide mortgage financing in urban areas benefiting mainly low- to medium-income families. The \nTA will support Credo\u2019s efforts to extend the reach of its banking services to rural clients, with a \nspecific focus on improving financial literacy and access to finance for women. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Georgia\u2019s  economy  is  exposed  to  volatility  because  of  its  small  market  size,  high \ndependence on imports of goods and remittances, and fluctuating exports resulting from unstable \ndemand from its neighbors. Recession in Georgia\u2019s South Caucasus neighbors, the Russian \nFederation, and Ukraine triggered a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) growth from 4.6% \nin 2014 to less than 2.9% in 2015 and 2016. The lari depreciated 52% during October 2014\u2013\nDecember 2016 because of the current account deficit and reduced foreign currency inflows. The \nunemployment rate declined from 16.9% in 2013 to 13.9% in 2017. About 22% of Georgians live \nbelow the national poverty line and many depend on remittances. Women, who earn about 65% \nof the average male wage, have high representation in the low-income segment, especially in \nrural Georgia, where women are 56% of the labor force. About 30% of Georgian residents live in \nthe capital, Tbilisi, which generated about 48% of GDP in 2016. Although 70% of Georgians live \nin rural areas and regional towns, agriculture contributed only 9% to GDP in 2017.1  \n \n4.  GDP growth recovered and reached 5% in 2017, led by trade, tourism, construction, and \ntransport. Improving hydrocarbon prices alleviated pressure on Georgia\u2019s trading partners, and \nexports of goods increased 24%. In addition, workers\u2019 remittances grew 21% and gross foreign \ndirect investment inflows rose to 12.3% of GDP in 2017. Despite the economic downturn in \nTurkey, ADB estimates Georgia\u2019s GDP to grow by 4.9% in 2018 and 5.0% in 2019.2 Although the \nlari stabilized in 2017, dollarization remains high, with 64% of bank liabilities denominated in \nforeign currency.3 Reducing dollarization is critical for reducing market and credit risks, and \nremains a long-term challenge. Since 2017, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) has mandated \nthe use of lari in economic transactions, increased capital charges for foreign exchange-related \nbanking  transactions  and  exposures, tightened  credit  exposure  limits for  unhedged foreign \n                                                \n1  National Statistics Office of Georgia. 2018. \n2  ADB. 2018. Asian Development Outlook 2018 Update: Maintaining Stability Amid Heightened Uncertainty.

Housing  sector.5  Georgia\u2019s  housing  stock  of  634,000  units  consists  of  about \n400,000 homes constructed before 1990. Built following the former Soviet Union\u2019s standards, \nabout 60% of the windows and doors in such apartments in Tbilisi lack thermal insulation, resulting \nin energy consumption that is twice the level of Eastern European countries. Consequently, \ndemand for new housing and improvements to existing housing are increasing. The housing stock \non the market grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% in Georgia during 2012\u2013\n2017. The average US dollar price per apartment in Tbilisi dropped 1.9% during this period, \nreflecting a shift in new construction from medium and high cost toward the lower-cost segment.6 \n \n6.  Housing finance availability has improved, as evident in the increase in mortgages and \ntenors  offered to  customers.  Outstanding mortgage  loans  in  US  dollars  during  2012\u20132017 \nincreased at a CAGR of 21% to GEL6.5 billion, while the average contractual maturity during \n2015\u20132017 increased by 12 months to 8.5 years for lari-denominated loans and to 9.8 years for \nUS dollar-denominated loans (footnote 3). With respect to affordability, the shortage of long-term \nlocal currency financing and the absence of a legal and institutional framework to support such \nlong-term capital market instruments as covered bonds limit the affordability of mortgage loans in \nlari for borrowers, especially for young and low-income families. The pricing differential between \nUS dollar- and lari-denominated loans remains high, at about 5% for comparable maturities, \nleading many borrowers to opt for riskier mortgage funding in US dollars. June 2018 statistics \nfrom TBC, Georgia\u2019s largest mortgage lender, show that the representation of female borrowers \nby income group is concentrated in annual incomes up to GEL50,000 and drops sharply in higher-\nincome groups, reflecting the lower incomes of households led by women. \n \n7.  Finance sector. Comprising 16 private banks and 83 nonbanks, the finance sector had \nassets totaling GEL36.7 billion or 71% of GDP in 2017, of which banks held 94%. Bank assets \nare concentrated, with TBC and Bank of Georgia accounting for 70%. During 2015\u20132017, bank \nloans to the private sector grew at a CAGR of 17%. Retail loans grew at a CAGR of 27%, \nrepresenting 47% of bank loans in 2017, which improved the credit risk diversification of banks. \nMortgages made up 28% of bank loans in 2017 and grew at a CAGR of 23% during 2015\u20132017. \nThe steep lari\u2013US dollar depreciation during 2014\u20132016 resulted in declining deposits growth, \nwell below loan growth. In 2016, dollarization had increased to 65% for loans and 71% for liabilities \nbefore easing in 2017 to 57% for loans and 64% for liabilities (footnote 5), after the NBG measures \ndiscussed in para. 4 were implemented. \n \n8.  Banking system profitability remained solid, with a return on assets of about 3% during \n2014\u20132017. Although net interest margins were robust, they fell from 5.3% in 2015 to 4.8% in \n2017, indicating increasing competition. Bank liquidity was stable, well exceeding NBG minimum \nrequirements. Capital adequacy ratios (CAR) declined because of the strong growth of risk-\nweighted assets since 2016, but remained sound at about 2% above the NBG minimum. Asset \nquality has been stable since 2015, with nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios (classified overdue \n                                                \n4  Effective 1 September 2018, the NBG tightened the loan-to-value and payment-to-income (PTI) thresholds for retail \nloan exposures for foreign exchange-denominated exposures to 10% below those for lari-denominated exposures. \n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Colliers International, a global real estate services company, defines the low-cost segment in Tbilisi as having a listed \nprice of $400\u2013$800 per square meter and the medium-cost segment as having a listed price of $800\u2013$1,200. \n \n ", "3 \nabove 90 days) at 2.8% in 2017.7 Deposits and loans are concentrated, with maturities of less \nthan 12 months, and sourcing long-term funding remains challenging for banks. Georgia\u2019s \nfinancial system has deepened, with the private sector\u2019s credit\u2013GDP ratio increasing from 40% in \n2014 to 59% in 2017, exceeding that of its South Caucasus peers but still trailing the Baltic \neconomies, Poland, and Turkey. \n \n9.  Since 2010, the NBG has carried out substantial reforms of its banking supervision \nincluding capital adequacy and liquidity management oversight of banks. Lender-of-last-resort \nfacilities and internal capital adequacy and liquidity assessments were augmented through \nintegrated micro- and macro-prudential supervision. A forward-looking approach guides banks on \nrisk mitigation by adjusting underwriting standards that show an explicit impact on stress test \nresults. The International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements recognize \nthe NBG\u2019s high standard and consider its innovative approach to be an important benchmark for \nother countries.8 The NBG instituted the Basel III capital adequacy framework in 2018, and three \nsystemically important banks (Bank of Georgia, Liberty Bank, and TBC) will have to build up their \ncapital to meet a minimum CAR of about 17% by 2022 from 13% in 2017.9 \n \n10.  During 2016\u20132017, the average interest rate eased by 90 basis points to 17.3% for lari-\ndenominated loans but dropped by 200 basis points to 8.5% for foreign exchange loans, widening \nthe differential between lari and foreign exchange loan interest rates. Similarly, the average \nmarket interest rate during 2016\u20132017 eased by 140 basis points to 7.2% for lari-denominated \ndeposits and by 120 basis points to 2.5% for foreign currency-denominated deposits, reducing \nthe differential between lari and foreign exchange market interest rates (footnote 3). The high loan \npricing differential reflects currency-induced credit risk as well as higher provisioning and capital \nrequirements, and the high price of lari loans limits the affordability of lari-denominated long-term \nmortgages.  Since  March  2014,  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs),  including  ADB,  the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Finance Corporation, \nhave been issuing lari-denominated bonds.  \n \n11.  Borrowers identification. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been active \nin Georgia\u2019s finance sector since 2007 and has provided loans to banks and nonbanks that \nprimarily support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including in areas outside Tbilisi. \nWith the growing demand and need for better housing, coupled with the need for longer-term lari \nmortgage financing, ADB selected TBC and Credo based on their strategies in targeting markets \nto cover different income strata and their willingness to offer longer-tenor financing. Both are \nexisting ADB clients. ADB has developed a close relationship with TBC, providing $50 million in \n2013 that was converted to lari in 2015, funded by ADB\u2019s first lari bond issue, followed by \n$100 million in 2016.10 TBC has demonstrated sound financial performance, an improving risk \nprofile, and good corporate governance, which led to a premium listing of TBC Bank Group PLC, \na UK based holding company (TBC UK), on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in August 2016. \n                                                \n7  NBG.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nTBC  has  a  countrywide  branch  and  multi-sales  channel  network  serving  2.2  million  retail \ncustomers. Its mortgage loan book reached GEL2.0 billion in June 2018, serving nearly 22,000 \nclients, among whom many are new homeowners in urban areas. TBC also had the largest \nmortgage market coverage in the low-income segment (up to GEL50,000 per annum) with an \naverage outstanding loan size of GEL71,500 ($27,300) or 60% of its mortgage book in June 2018 \nand women constituted 37% of TBC\u2019s mortgage borrowers in that segment. \n \n12.  In 2015, ADB built a strong partnership with Credo when it provided a loan of GEL49 \nmillion (footnote 10) and TA to support its transformation from a microfinance lender to a bank. \nFollowing discussions with ADB, Credo has developed two mortgage products for low-income \nhouseholds. The products are untested, but Credo has carried out a robust market assessment \namong its clients that forms the basis of its strategy to reach the underserved low-income housing \nfinance segment. In addition to improving living conditions in rural Georgia, Credo\u2019s products will \nsupport the diversification of income generation for low-income households via homestays. The \ntransaction with Credo will help improve outreach to rural women via digital services, support \nfinancial literacy campaigns, and build the home assets of households led by women. \n \n13.  Lessons Learned. ADB learned from its previous transactions with TBC and Credo in \nGeorgia, as well as its operations in the Caucasus and Central Asia, that its provision of loans in \nlocal currency is important to reduce currency-induced credit risk for the target beneficiaries. The \nselection of larger financial intermediaries with a business strategy aligned to ADB\u2019s strategic \nobjectives, as in the case of TBC, has proven to be effective not only for reaching significant target \nbeneficiaries in the SME segment, but also clients for new areas such as affordable housing. The \nselection of a qualified intermediary such as Credo has been effective in developing services to \nbeneficiaries in remote rural areas and now will cater to their growing housing finance needs. \nFinally, the long-standing collaboration of ADB with NBG via sovereign, non-sovereign, and \ntreasury operations has facilitated the development of capital markets, especially the provision of \nlocal currency financing. \n \nB.  Credo Bank \n \n1.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n14.  Credo serves 230,000 borrowers via 66 branches and 1,872 staff as of 2017. Its loan book \nof GEL532 million is well-diversified. With Credo\u2019s large client base and small average loan size \nof GEL2,300, the loan book is highly granular and provides a favorable risk profile. With 46% of \nloans in agriculture, Credo has a strong rural footprint. In March 2017, Credo obtained a banking \nlicense to provide comprehensive payment, deposit, and lending services to its clients. These \nclients are predominantly low-income individuals and farm households\u201451% of which are led by \nwomen\u2014that generate income from farming and business, including agritourism. As a result of \nthe NBG policy of imposing lari for small loans (para. 4), dollarization of Credo\u2019s loan book \ndropped substantially from 60% in 2014 to 17% in 2017, while that of its liabilities and equity was \nlimited to 27% in 2017, thereby improving Credo\u2019s and its clients\u2019 currency risk profile. \n \n15.  Credo now plans to launch a product that facilitates the purchase of low-cost housing for \nlower-income clients in rural towns and the periphery of the capital as well as home renovation \nloans focused on rural areas. It will use its existing staff and cash flow-based credit methodology, \nwhich is well adapted to low-income clients.11 Credo plans to grow its housing loan book to 15% \n                                                \n11  Household income cash flows are suitable to determine debt service capacity of low-income borrowers. The \nestimated net income is used to determine the loan size for the borrower.  \n ", "5 \nof total loans by 2023. In addition, Credo has identified and trained staff to implement its deposit \nmobilization strategy across Georgia. The strategy is spearheaded by the head of retail, an \nexperienced banker from Bank Republic with in-depth retail marketing and product experience. \n \n2.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n16.  Established in 1997 by World Vision as a microfinance organization, Credo was purchased \nin October 2014 by a consortium led by Access Microfinance Holding AG (AMH), with a 60.2% \nshare; two microfinance investment funds managed by Triodos Investment Management BV, with \na  19.8%  share;  and  investment  funds  managed  by  responsAbility  Participation  AG  and \nresponsAbility Investments AG, with a 20.0% share. Supported by its founder and shareholders, \nCredo has built a sound credit culture, high integrity standards, responsible finance policies, and \nquality lending services to low-income households in Georgia. \n \n17.  Integrity and enhanced tax due diligence were conducted.12 No significant or potentially \nsignificant integrity risks were identified. After reviewing the transaction, ADB does not believe \nthat Credo has been established or is being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, or \ncross-border tax evasion. Credo\u2019s majority shareholder, AMH, is owned by reputable IFIs and \nwell-established philanthropic investors. While AMH recently suffered losses in its AccessBank \nsubsidiaries in Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, reflecting severe adverse economic conditions, its \nintegrity remains sound; its governance and management were enhanced in January 2018 by \nstreamlining its supervisory and management boards and legally separating the advisory and \nasset management business of LFS Financial Systems GmbH, AMH\u2019s original sponsor. \n \n18.  Credo is governed by the meeting of shareholders and a two-tier board comprising the \nboard of directors (BOD) and the board of management (BOM). The BOD oversees Credo\u2019s \nstrategy and operations. All current BOD members are bankers with extensive international \nemerging market banking and BOD experience. Since obtaining its banking license, Credo has \nstreamlined its BOM, which is composed of Zaal Pirtskelava, the chief executive officer (CEO) \nwho has a 20-year record with Credo; the chief financial officer (CFO); and the chief operating \nofficer (COO). The BOM is supported by an experienced management team whose members \nhave mostly moved up from being loan officers. In 2016, Credo recruited Irakli Zatiashvili, an \nexperienced Georgian commercial banker with a bank supervision background, as CFO. \n \n3.  Financial Performance \n \n19.  Capital adequacy. Profitable operations resulted in strong retained earnings supporting \nthe buildup of capital, which reached GEL120 million at a CAGR of 17% during 2015\u20132017. As \nCredo only became a bank in March 2017, it has a short capital adequacy history. In June 2018, \nCredo reported a total CAR of 16.4%, providing a comfortable 3.2% buffer in line with the NBG\u2019s \nnew  capital  adequacy  measurement.  Credo\u2019s  well-diversified  exposure  and  small  size  are \nreflected in the NBG\u2019s capital adequacy requirement for Credo. \n \n20.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. Credo\u2019s loan book of $205 million equivalent in 2017 \nis well-diversified and quickly liquidating, with an average tenor below 2 years. The loan book has \na strong focus on agriculture (46%), followed by services and trade (31%), retail (21%), and \nmanufacturing (2%). So far, retail does not include housing loans. Although the agriculture loan \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2003.

Manila.  \n ", "6 \nbook growth was modest at a CAGR of 5% during 2015\u20132017, Credo\u2019s support of the rural \neconomy remains strong. Loans to households grew strongly since their introduction in 2014 at a \nCAGR of 28% during 2015\u20132017, while services and trade reflect a more mature segment and \ngrew at a CAGR of 14% in the same period. Credo\u2019s credit policy and underwriting practices are \nprudent, supported by rigorous client selection and monitoring. Credo\u2019s asset quality remains \nsound, with a 0.9% share of net impaired loans to gross loans in 2017, according to ADB\u2019s NPL \ndefinition.13 Provisioning is conservative, with loan loss reserves representing 169.8% of classified \nloans in 2017. \n \n21.  Earnings and profitability. Declining market interest rates because of rising competition \nand  the  doubling  of  nonearning  assets  associated  with  NBG  minimum  liquidity  reserve \nrequirements led to a decline of net interest income by GEL6.5 million in 2017, which was only \npartly offset by the increased fee income of GEL3.3 million. As a result, net income dropped to \nGEL20.1 million. A 3.3% return on average assets was still achieved in 2017 and the return on \naverage equity reached 18.4% in the same year. \n \n22.  Funding and liquidity. With the banking license in place, Credo started to mobilize \ndeposits in June 2018 as described in para.14. Since 2015, Credo has been gradually replacing \nforeign currency through lari funding, which represented 73% of its funding in 2017. Credo plans \nto boost long-term lari funding via term deposits, which are still at very modest levels, as well as \nIFI loans. Credo\u2019s liquidity profile is adequate, with liquid assets accounting for 20% of short-term \nliabilities. \n \nC.  TBC Bank \n \n1.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n23.  With the acquisition of Bank Republic, TBC is now Georgia\u2019s largest bank with market \nshares of 38% for loans and 39% for deposits in 2017. TBC is a systemically important bank. Its \nassets reached GEL12.6 billion in 2017, increasing at a CAGR of 27% since 2011. In the same \nperiod, TBC achieved strong loan growth at a CAGR of 26%, reaching GEL8.6 billion. At the end \nof 2017, micro, SME, retail, and corporate segments made up 68% of its assets, representing a \nstrong franchise. TBC\u2019s unique strength lies in its business sophistication via cost-effective \nelectronic distribution channels. With the full integration of Bank Constanta, a rural-focused \nmicrofinance  bank,  and  Bank  Republic,  TBC  improved  its  rural  presence  and  maximized \nsynergies for small business lending, while deepening its urban service outreach. TBC\u2019s deposits \nreached GEL7.9 billion and its capital was GEL2.2 billion in 2017. Since 2014, Fitch Ratings has \nkept TBC\u2019s long-term issuer default rating on par with the sovereign rating at BB\u2013, with a positive \noutlook. In 2018, Moody\u2019s Investors Service upgraded TBC\u2019s foreign currency rating to Ba3 and \nits local currency rating to Ba2, both with a stable outlook. With increased competition and depth \nof financial services in Georgia, TBC is preparing to diversify to other regional markets. \n \n2.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n24.  Established in 1992, TBC created in May 2016 TBC UK, which owns 99.9% of TBC \nshares, representing 97.26% of TBC UK\u2019s assets and 100% of TBC Insurance JSC, representing \n0.34%  of  TBC  UK\u2019s  assets.  TBC  currently  owns  100%  of  TBC  Kredit  LLC  (TBC  Kredit), \nAzerbaijan, representing 0.26% of TBC UK\u2019s assets as well as eight very small Georgia based \n                                                \n13 ADB\u2019s NPL definition includes loans (i) past due more than 90 days; (ii) classified substandard, doubtful, and loss; \nand (iii) restructured within 12 months of the reporting date. \n ", "7 \nsubsidiaries representing 2.14% of TBC UK\u2019s assets. TBC UK was listed on the LSE premium \nsegment on 4 August 2016. More than 50% of TBC UK\u2019s shares are traded as free float, meeting \nLSE\u2019s  minimum  requirement.  The  two  Georgian  founders,  Badri  Japaridze  and  Mamuka \nKhazaradze, own 20.5%; IFIs reduced their shareholding from 54.0% in 2014 to 11.2% in June \n2018. Institutional investors include Schroder Investment Management Limited (8.8%), J.P. \nMorgan Asset Management (8.8%), Dunross and Co. AB (5.6%), and other undisclosed investors \nwhose  combined  holdings  represent  45.1%  of  share  capital.  With  the  LSE  listing,  TBC\u2019s \ngovernance and management sophistication and systems improved substantially. To ensure that \ntransactions and relationships are kept on an arm\u2019s length basis, on 31 May 2016 TBC UK entered \ninto a relationship agreement with the TBC founders and their affiliates. \n \n25.  Integrity and enhanced tax due diligence were conducted. After reviewing the transaction, \nADB does not believe that TBC is being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, or cross-\nborder tax evasion. As TBC UK is listed on the LSE and is subject to the enhanced regulatory \nenvironment the United Kingdom requires, the risks associated with TBC are not considered \nsignificant.  \n \n26.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n27.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n28.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n29.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n30.  Governance structure. The meeting of the shareholders is TBC UK\u2019s supreme governing \nbody. It elects the BOD; sets policy, strategy, and business targets, and appoints and supervises \nthe BOM. TBC UK has nine directors, including the two founders, with Mamuka Khazaradze as \nTBC chair since 1992. Five TBC UK directors are nonexecutive independent directors (all senior \nprofessionals with international banking experience, of which two are female) and two, the CEO \nand the CFO, are TBC executives. TBC has seven directors, which are identical to TBC UK except \nfor the CEO, Vakhtang Butskrikidze, and the CFO, Giorgi Shagidze, who as executives, do not \nqualify as directors under NBG regulations. \n \n31.  In line with the United Kingdom\u2019s Code of Corporate Governance, listing rules, and NBG \nregulations, the  BOD  is  supported  by  dedicated  committees for  (i) remuneration,  which  is \nresponsible for BOM remuneration; (ii) corporate governance and nomination, which develops \ncorporate governance policies and handles BOM appointments; (iii) audit; and (iv) risks, ethics, \nand compliance, which oversees risk management, including large exposures. TBC executives \nare not represented on BOD committees. \n \n32.  Management. TBC\u2019s BOM is composed of eight executives: the CEO, the first deputy \nCEO, the COO, the CFO, the chief risk officer, and the heads for retail, SME, and corporate \nbusiness. All are professional bankers who are qualified to lead the bank; four have been with \nTBC for more than 8 years and four have international experience. The BOM sets and reviews \nTBC\u2019s strategy and business targets and prepares TBC policies. The BOM is supported by asset\u2013\nliability management, credit, and operational risk management committees. Business functions \nare separated into corporate, retail, and micro and SME segments. The chief risk officer leads \nrisk management, and legal; the CFO oversees finance, treasury, accounting, and strategy; and \nthe  COO  heads  operations  and  information  technology.  Corporate  business  and  risk  are \ncentralized at the head office, while SME, micro, and retail relationships are managed at the \nbranch level. TBC\u2019s organization reflects an adequate separation of business generation and risk \ncontrol. \n \n ", "8 \n3.  Financial Performance \n \n33.  Capital adequacy. TBC increased its capital at a CAGR of 23% during 2015\u20132017, but \nthis was exceeded by the growth of risk-weighted assets (36%) mainly because of the acquisition \nof Bank Republic. The CAR weakened from 16.0% in 2015 to 13.5% in 2017, but is still above \nthe 10.5% limit. Beginning in 2018, Georgian banks must comply with the NBG\u2019s new capital \nadequacy framework. As a systemically important bank, TBC will have to gradually meet a \nminimum total CAR increase from 16.5% in 2018 to an estimated 17.6% in 2022. The required \nCAR is updated periodically based on TBC\u2019s risk profile set by the NBG. TBC projects that it will \nexceed a CAR of 18% in 2022, well above the required NBG minimum. \n \n34.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. TBC improved its risk profile by reducing the share of \ncorporate loans from 46% in 2011 to 29% in 2017, while increasing retail loans from 39% to 49% \nand MSME loans from 15% to 22%. Retail loans grew at a CAGR of 31%. Within retail, TBC\u2019s \nmortgage loan book represented 24% of total loans in 2017. Top 20 group exposures made up \n94% of corporate loans in 2017. While significant, large exposures are diversified in different \nareas, including energy and utilities, hospitality, food, telecommunications, real estate, and trade. \nRelated party exposures have been negligible since 2014. \n \n35.  TBC\u2019s asset quality has improved, with the gross NPL ratio using ADB\u2019s definition falling \nfrom 6.2% in 2015 to 4.5% in 2017. Following TBC\u2019s NPL definition, NPLs are adequately \nprovisioned; loan loss reserves made up 81% of NPLs and, in addition to conservative loan \ncollateralization, covered 209% of NPLs in 2017. TBC\u2019s retail segment has good asset quality, \nwith reported NPL ratios not exceeding 2.7%. Within retail, the mortgage loan book has the best \nasset quality with an NPL ratio of 2.0% in 2017. As for corporate loans, the NPL ratio is traditionally \nhigher, declining from 7.9% in 2015 to 4.8% in 2017, partly because of corporate loan growth. \nThe MSME NPL ratio increased moderately from 4.4% in 2015 to 4.6% in 2017. Overall, TBC has \nmaintained acceptable asset quality. \n \n36.  Earnings and profitability. TBC registered strong net income growth from GEL218.7 \nmillion in 2015 to GEL359.9 million in 2017, although increasing competition in the MSME and \nretail segments resulted in a decline of its net interest margin by 199 basis points to 5.9%. Despite \nthe cost related to the acquisition of Bank Republic, TBC\u2019s streamlined business processes \nimproved the cost\u2013income ratio by 162 basis points and maintained strong profitability. As a \nresult, the return on average assets of not less than 4.1% and the return on average equity of not \nless than 19.6% were recorded during 2015\u20132017. \n \n37.  Funding and liquidity. TBC largely funds itself through deposits with a contractual \nmaturity of less than 12 months, which covered 71.8% of funding in 2017. Borrowings constituted \nthe remainder of funding. TBC manages its liquidity risk to meet cash flow needs using the liquidity \ncoverage ratio within 12 months. TBC stress tests liquidity coverage weekly and has consistently \nmet NBG minimum liquidity requirements. TBC\u2019s balance sheet is highly dollarized (66% in loans \nand 69% in liabilities in 2017). \n \n ", "9 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n38.  The transactions will support affordable mortgage and home renovation financing for \nurban and rural dwellers with lower and medium incomes.14 The proposed ADB assistance \ncomprises senior loans of (i) up to $25 million or its lari equivalent to Credo with a tenor of up to \n5 years, and (ii) up to the lari equivalent of $100 million to TBC with a tenor of up to 6 years. ADB\u2019s \nassistance also includes a $0.5 million TA to Credo. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n39.  The proposed loans will be governed by agreements that contain terms customary for \nloans of this nature and amount. ADB will monitor the transactions, providing annual monitoring \nreports no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. The banks will provide ADB with \nfinancial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, including annual \naudited financial statements, quarterly compliance certificates, periodic reports on the sub-loans \nfinanced by the ADB loans, development indicator reports, and TA implementation and impact \nreports from Credo. \n \nC.  Value Added and Rationale of ADB Assistance \n \n40.  Broadening access to finance. The mortgage market is still nascent in Georgia and long-\nterm funding is needed for home renovation and mortgages. The transactions will considerably \nimprove financing for housing loans and enable access to housing and mortgage funding on a \nbroader scale for lower- and middle-income segments. ADB\u2019s long-tenor funding will enable \nCredo and TBC to provide long-term housing loans to their customers.15 ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department is also working closely with ADB\u2019s Treasury Department to secure long-\nterm lari funding through ADB bonds (depending on market conditions) to help reduce the banks\u2019 \nand sub-borrowers\u2019 exposure to currency risk. \n \n41.  Supporting the buildup of a new bank. Credo has just converted to a bank and is \nexpanding its product offerings to serve excluded or underbanked segments better. The proposed \nloan will support Credo\u2019s new initiative\u2014a result of ADB\u2019s intensive dialogue with Credo during \nthe preparation of the transaction\u2014to serve lower-income homeowners, thereby helping to reduce \nrural poverty and improve living conditions.  \n \n42.  Improving financial inclusion for women in rural Georgia. Low rates of land ownership \nand  lower  incomes  impede  women from fully  benefiting from  Georgia\u2019s  improving  banking \nservices industry, especially in rural areas. As a bank, Credo plans to expand coverage from \nlending to full banking services and make special efforts to improve the financial literacy of \nwomen\u2014moving from a credit-only approach to services that include savings and insurance, \nwhich can mitigate the volatility of women\u2019s incomes, especially in rural areas. The attached TA \n(para. 51) will support this effort. TBC also has gender-specific targets to facilitate mortgage \nlending outreach to low-income households led by women.  \n \n                                                \n14 Under the transactions, sub-loan exposures up to GEL100,000 are eligible for Credo financing and sub-loan \nexposures up to GEL250,000 are eligible for TBC financing. \n15 As noted in para. 32, deposits constitute 71.8% of TBC\u2019s funding with a contractual maturity of less than 12 months. \n ", "10 \nD.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE.  Technical Assistance \n \n51.  The TA will support Credo\u2019s efforts to expand cost-effective services to its rural clients, \nespecially women, and broaden its service offerings beyond lending. The TA is estimated to cost \nup to $1.3 million, of which up to $0.5 million is expected to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Credo will cover the remaining cost of \nthe TA, estimated at $0.8 million. To ensure adequate management, accountability, ownership of \nCredo over the execution of services and timely response to local needs identified during \nimplementation, the administration (selection and execution) will, as successfully executed in an \nongoing project, be delegated to Credo to be carried out following ADB policies and established \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. The role of ADB will be to monitor the compliance of \nconsultant selection, procurement, and the use of funds with ADB policies, and to track outputs \nfor development effectiveness. Credo will carry out reporting and periodical impact assessments \nof the TA measures, with a special focus on its female beneficiaries. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n52.  Impact. The transactions will support the government\u2019s strategy to achieve inclusive \neconomic growth, via improved financial intermediation, broader access to finance and provision \nof mortgage-based instruments. Affordable housing is seen as a key pillar of social security.  \n \n53.  Outcome. The outcomes for the transactions will be that (i) the availability of Credo\u2019s \nhousing finance lending to low-income families is sustainably improved; and (ii) the availability of \nTBC\u2019s affordable mortgage lending to low and middle-income families is improved.  \n \n54.  Outputs. For the transaction with Credo, the outputs are that (i) Credo\u2019s outreach to rural \nfemale customers is improved; (ii) Credo\u2019s capacity for financing mortgages and home renovation \nis expanded; and (iii) Credo\u2019s operations, marketing, and tracking systems are more gender \nequitable. For the transaction with TBC, the outputs are that (i) TBC\u2019s capacity for financing \nmortgages  is  expanded;  and  (ii)  TBC\u2019s  marketing  and  tracking  systems  are  more  gender \nequitable. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n55.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The proposed transactions \nsupport the following key operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) promoting rural development; and (iii) improving progress \n ", "11 \nin gender equality through the gender action plans.16 The two transactions are consistent with \ngovernment efforts to promote the well-being of its citizens and ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2014\u20132018 for Georgia.17 \n \n56.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB plays a tangible \nrole in deepening the finance sector in Georgia. Since 2007, it has provided nonsovereign loans \namounting to $255 million and TA to banks (Bank of Georgia, Credo, Finca Bank, and TBC) and \nthe NBG. Bank of Georgia, Basis Bank, and TBC also benefit from ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. \nThe  loans  to  Credo  and  TBC  will  strengthen  the  relationship  with  ADB  further.  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign efforts align with a sovereign program approved in 2016 and a new program \nanticipated for 2019 to develop the capital markets, including the issuance of lari bonds and \ncovered bond legislation, among other banking policy reforms.18  \n \n57.  Support for base of the income pyramid. ADB\u2019s funding to Credo will help at least \n5,000 borrowers, predominantly from the base of the income pyramid (lowest income quantities), \nto access term loans for micro housing and related investments in water and sanitation, thereby \nimproving their household living conditions. As ADB\u2019s financing helps enable access to such \nfinance, the transaction is classified inclusive business. In addition, ADB\u2019s funding to TBC, which \nin June 2018 had 45% of its mortgage loans outstanding and 59% of its mortgage customers in \na low-income segment up to GEL30,000, has high development impact and contributes to the \nachievement  of  Sustainable  Development  Goal  10  (reduce  inequality  within  and  among \ncountries). \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n58.  Category FI (treated as C). ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). TBC\u2019s mortgage and Credo\u2019s housing loan and home \nrenovation  activities  to  be  funded  under  the  transactions  have  minimal  or  no  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples. The borrowers will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) \nexclude funding by ADB of activities with category A and B environment and social safeguard \nimpacts; (iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and abide by applicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant \nto ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy; and (iv) take measures to  comply with internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. The borrowers will confirm this in their periodic reports to ADB \nand need not apply any other specific safeguard or social requirements. \n \n59.  The transaction with Credo is classified as having gender mainstreaming as a theme \nwhereas the transaction with TBC is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Following \nADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), Credo and TBC incorporate measures to \npromote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment under the proposed transactions in its \nbusiness activities. Key features of the gender action plans include the targeting of housing loans \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2018.

Anticorruption Policy \n \n60.  Credo and TBC were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n61.  The proposed loans are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n62.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),19 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Georgia \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to Credo and TBC. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n63.  I am satisfied that the (i) proposed  loan for Low-Income Housing Finance; and (ii) \nproposed loan for Affordable Mortgage Finance, each, in Georgia, would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The recommendations described in paras. \n64 and 65 are several and each should be separately considered by the Board. Each proposed \nloan would be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and incorporate such terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to \nthe Board. \n \n64.  I recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to $25,000,000 or its lari equivalent to \nCredo Bank JSC. \n \n65.
