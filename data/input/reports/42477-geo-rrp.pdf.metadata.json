The major impact of the conflict is a sharp contraction in \nto  3.5%, \nfrom  a  projected  9% \neconomic  growth \nprecipitated  by  a  steep  decline \nforeign \ninvestments.  Georgia  also  faces  a  significant  social  burden  of \nresettling over 120,000 internally displaced persons, and meeting \nthe challenge of finding jobs for over 100,000 newly unemployed. \nThere  is  major  stress  on  Georgia\u2019s  public  finances  arising  from \nconsiderable  shortfalls  in  revenue  collections  and  a  decline  in \nprivatization  proceeds,  and  the  banking  system  faces  severe \nliquidity  constraints.  Infrastructure  damage  is  tangible,  but  not \nlarge.  \n\nin  domestic  and \n\nThe Emergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery (EAPCR) is \nanchored  on  the  joint  needs  assessment  (JNA)  involving  multiple \ndevelopment  partners.  The  JNA  estimates  that  $3.7  billion  will  be \nneeded for Georgia\u2019s post-conflict recovery. Out of this, $895 million \nwill  be  needed  for  the  recovery  efforts  immediately  (for  the  period \nuntil  March  2009),  including  $480 million  to  meet  immediate \nbudgetary needs. The JNA calls for development partner support in \nthree major areas: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \nrapid restoration of confidence; \nmeeting social needs; and \nmeeting  critical \nprospects. \n\nto  maximize \n\ninvestments \n\nrecovery \n\nTo  help  Georgia  address  emergency  needs  under  the  JNA,  the \nEAPCR  will  enable  the  Government  to  meet  critical  public \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\n \nTranching \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nDisbursement \n\n \nBenefits \n\nexpenditures  through  the  budget  and  help  cushion  the  adverse \nrevenue  shocks.    The  EAPCR  will  supplement  the  Municipal \nServices  Development  Fund  Project  recently  approved  by  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The United States has signed an \nagreement  providing  $250  million  to  meet  critical  expenditures \nthrough the budget. The World Bank recently approved $40 million \nin  budget  support  using  the  Fourth  Poverty  Reduction  Support \nOperation.  The  European  Union  is  also  expected  to  provide \nbudgetary assistance in the near future.   \n   \nThe major outputs of the EAPCR are to ensure that: \n \n(i) \n\nthe immediate incremental expenditure needs arising from \nthe conflict are met; and \nthe  core  public  expenditure  program  for  2008  is  delivered \nin accordance with the approved budget.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \nThe  EAPCR  will  help  Georgia  to  revitalize  its  economy  back  to \npre-conflict levels of growth and social development. The outcome \nis adverse economic and social impact of the conflict mitigated. \n\nThe  EAPCR  is  anchored  on  the  JNA  and  was  prepared  in  close \ncoordination  with  other  development  partners.  EAPCR  swiftly \nresponds to the Government\u2019s urgent request to provide it with a \ncushion  and  help  meet  immediate  and  essential  expenditures \nthrough the budget, as it adopts a counter-cyclical fiscal response \nto deal with the conflict.  \n\nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing \nRights 46,879,000 (equivalent to $70 million) from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  for  the  EAPCR.  The  loan  will  carry  interest  at \n1% a year and a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of \n10 years, with repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first 10 \nyears after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter.  \n\nThe expected closing date of the loan is 30 September 2009. The \nloan is planned to be fully utilized by the Government by 31 March \n2009. \n\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency.  \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  meet  essential  expenditure \nneeds and shall not be used to fund ineligible items under ADB\u2019s \nnegative list.   \n\nThe  adverse  impact  on  economic  growth  from  the  conflict  is \nunprecedented. The economic and social impact of the conflict is \nexerting budgetary pressures that were unexpected. The EAPCR \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nthe  Government \n\nfiscal \nwill  assist \nmeasures  aimed  at  preventing  the  economy  from  being  locked \ninto  a  downward  growth  spiral,  particularly  in  the  context  of  the \nongoing global financial market turmoil.  \n\nimplement  countercyclical \n\nregional \n\ntensions.  Domestic \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  While there are significant downside risks, Georgia\u2019s economy is well \npositioned to adjust to the temporary shocks of the conflict. External \nrisks include (i) the protracted global credit crisis and recession, and \ninclude \nrisks \n(ii) rekindling  of \n(i) increased  economic  difficulties  could  set  back \nreforms, \n(ii) countercyclical  fiscal  policy  insufficient  to  kick-start  growth,  and \n(iii) weakening of the banking sector. \n \nThese external risks are mitigated by several factors. First, while a \nprotracted  global  credit  crisis  will  likely  mean  a  reduction  in \nfinancial  flows  to  Georgia,  it  will  trigger  a  needed  refocus  on \nstrengthening  the  regulatory  environment  for  the  financial  sector \nand  increased  reliance on  internal deposit  mobilization  by  banks. \nThe deep structural reforms of the last 4 years have increased the \nresiliency  of  the  economy  to  adjust  to  external  shocks.  Second, \nconcerning the risk of increased regional tensions, intense efforts \nto reach a peaceful agreement are under way.  \n \nIn terms of mitigating factors for domestic risks, first, with regard to \nthe  risk  of  dissipation  of  reform  momentum,  the  Government \nlaunched  the  JNA  within  days  of  the  outbreak  of  the  conflict  to \nensure  that  there  is  a  clear  strategy  for  keeping  the  focus  on \nreforms  and  secure  the  necessary  resources  for  remaining  on \ntrack.  Second,  the  EAPCR  is  part  of  a  broader  stabilization \npackage  that  includes  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  World \nBank,  and  other  development  partners.  Hence  the  post-conflict \nconfidence  building  is  well  coordinated  and  the  overall  impact  in \nterms  of  ensuring  the  effectiveness  of  the  countercyclical  fiscal \npolicy stance is thus expected to be positive. In regard to the risk \nof  weakening  of  the  banking  sector,  capital  requirements  have \nbeen  conservative  enough  in  the  recent  past  to  allow  for  the \ncurrent  counter-cyclical  adjustments  and  JNA  development \npartners are expected to provide support to this sector.  \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \n\n1. \nGeorgia for the Emergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery (EAPCR or the loan).1  \n \n\nII. \n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE AUGUST 2008 CONFLICT  \n\n2. \nPre-Conflict  Economic  Performance.  Over  the  last  5  years,  Georgia  has  implemented \nfar-reaching  macroeconomic,  structural,  and  sector  reforms  that  helped  attract  significant  foreign \ndirect  investment  (FDI)  and  strengthen  public  finances.  Economic  growth,  supported  by  surging \nFDI  inflows,  averaged  10.5%  over  2005\u20132007  and  reached  12.4%  in  2007.  Prior  to  the  August \narmed conflict with the Russian Federation (August conflict or conflict), growth was forecast to slow \nto 9% (still robust) during 2008 and 2009. Appendix 2 presents a summary of the macroeconomic \nand reform progress achieved prior to the August conflict.  \n \n3. \nConflict-Related  Shocks  to  Growth  Pillars.  The  August  conflict  has  shaken  the  key \npillars  of  economic  growth  and  stability  in  Georgia.  The  shocks  include  a  steep  decline  in \nconsumer,  investor,  and  lender  confidence;  a  sharp  contraction  in  banking  system  liquidity; \nsignificant  stress  on  public  finances;  120,000  additional  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs);  and \ndamage  to  physical  infrastructure.  As  a  result,  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  is \nexpected to slow down to 3.5% in 2008. Recovery could begin in the second quarter of 2009 with \nan increase in GDP growth to 4% in 2009 (Table 1 and Figure 1), but this will be contingent on the \nGovernment adopting adequate counter-cyclical fiscal measures. \n \n\nFigure 1: Shock to Economic Activity \n\n20\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n \n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\neconomic growth scenario pre-conflict (LHS axis)\n\neconomic growth scenario post-conflict (LHS axis)\n\nFDI (% GDP) scenario pre-conflict (RHS axis)\n\nFDI (% GDP) scenario post-conflict (RHS axis)\n\nGDP = gross domestic product; FDI = foreign direct investment; LHS = left-hand side; RHS = right-hand side \n\nSource:  United  Nations  and  World  Bank.  2008.

In  response,  a  core  team  led  by  the  World  Bank,  and  consisting  of  the \nEuropean  Commission  (EC)  and  the  United  Nations  (UN)\u2014together  with  technical  sector  teams  comprising \nrepresentatives  of  these  institutions,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  European  Bank  of  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment,  European  Investment  Bank,  and  International  Finance  Corporation\u2014prepared  a  joint  needs \nassessment (JNA) for economic recovery.  \n \nThe JNA draws on reports prepared by the EC of initial estimates of conflict-related damages and those prepared by \nthe  UN  of  conditions  in  Abkhazia  and  South  Ossetia,  Georgia.  Because  of  problems  of  access, field  visits  to  these \nregions could not take place. The assessment of needs in these two regions is based on information and data from \nother parties, such as EC satellite imagery and assessments by the UN system. The report was guided by the post-\nconflict needs assessments methodology, which includes both (i) assessment of needs, and (ii) national prioritization \nand costing of needs in an accompanying transitional results matrix. The teams examined (i) the macroeconomic and \nbanking impact of the conflict, (ii) the impact on the social sectors and on directly and indirectly affected populations, \nand (iii) infrastructure and environment.  \n \nBecause  the  conflict  resulted  in  shocks  to  key  pillars  of  Georgian  economic  growth  and  financial  stability,  the  JNA \nwas also tasked to quantify countercyclical medium-term stabilization resource requirements for Georgia to avoid a \nsharper and more protracted economic downturn. It was therefore agreed with the Government that the JNA would \nalso identify areas for new investments in order to bridge the period of a temporary decline in foreign investment (of \nuncertain duration), to provide Georgia with a basis for a rapid return to growth, and present an overall strategy for \nrecovery as well as priority actions and investments based on this strategy. \n \nThe JNA estimates that $3.7 billion from development partners will be needed for Georgia\u2019s post-conflict recovery. Of \nthis, $895 million will be needed for immediate recovery efforts, including $480 million to fund the budgetary financing \ngap.  Actions  required  are  prioritized  and  are  presented  in  three  sequential  time  frames\u2014the  first  of  6  months  (to \nMarch  2009)  (immediate);  a  second  of  a  further  12  months  (to  March  2010);  and  a  last  phase  of  a  further  12\u201318 \nmonths (up to September 2011), for a total of 3 years. The overall time frame is the estimated transition period where \nspecific  actions  will  be  required  to  bring  Georgia  to  its  normal  path  of  growth,  when  extraordinary  development \npartner support can end. The initial phase (of 7 months ending in March 2009) has been tailored to allow for proper \ncoordination  and  sequencing  of  the  immediate  humanitarian  response,  which  is  also  reflected  in  the  UN\u2019s  Georgia \nCrisis Flash Appeal 2008. \n \nThe JNA identifies the need for development partner assistance in three major areas: \n \n(i)  Support  for  the  rapid  restoration  of  confidence.  Rejuvenating  economic  growth  will  be  the  best  way  that \nGeorgia  can  help  itself.  Development  partners  can  help  best  by  providing  budget  support  in  aid  of  countercyclical \nfiscal measures to ensure that critical economic and social needs are met.  \n  \n(ii)  Support  for  social  needs.  The  resettlement  of  internally  displaced  persons  and  the  post-conflict  needs  of \naffected populations are likely to require significant support. \n \n(iii) Support  for  critical  investments. In accordance  with the JNA\u2019s assessment, certain high-value and high-yield \ninvestments are key to maximize recovery prospects. These are recognized as \u201ccore investments\u201d in the report. Such \nfinancing  would also help the country enhance economic security by broadening access and connectivity in energy \nand transport spheres. \n   \nThe Government and development partners organized a Georgia Donor Conference on 22 October 2008 in Brussels, \nBelgium,  under  the  auspices  of  the  EC,  where  the  Government  formally  sought  development  partner  assistance \nalong the above lines. Development partners have pledged a total of $4.5 billion in support over 2008-2010, of which \n$2 billion will be in the form of grants. \n \nSources: United Nations and World Bank. 2008.

The  Government\u2019s  response  on  the  economic  and  social \nfronts to the August conflict has been swift and commendable. It immediately launched efforts to \nbolster the public\u2019s confidence that there is a clear strategy to address post-conflict challenges \nand  emerge  with  a  stronger  economy.  The  launching  of  the  JNA  within  days  after  the  conflict \natic manner. \nwas a key step to guide the rehabilitation and reconstruction process in a system\nhe fiscal, monetary, and financial sector authorities have coordinated very closely. When the \nT\nlari came under pressure in August, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) intervened to support \nthe  currency  in  accordance  with  its  managed  exchange  rate  policy  regime.  To  shore  up \nreserves depleted in defense of the lari and to bolster lari depositor confidence, the Government \nand NBG entered into a $750 million standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF).  \n \n12. \nTo  ease  the  liquidity  squeeze  faced  by  banks,  NBG  in  coordination  with  the  Financial \nSupervisory  Agency  adopted  a  countercyclical  regulatory  response  comprising:  (i)  lowering \nreserve  requirements,  (ii) \nlowering  the  liquidity  ratio  requirement,  (iii)  introducing  a  special \nridge financing facility, and (iv) introducing a refinancing window to provide a new benchmark \nb\nolicy rate.  \np\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nPressures are evident on the fiscal front. An amendment to the 2008 budget, submitted \n13. \nin  Septemb\npre-conflict \ner  2008  to  Parliament,  projects  lower  revenues  than  envisaged  in  the \nperiod;  lower  privatization  receipts;  higher  expenditures  as  a  result  of  the  conflict;  and  a \ndecrease  in  nonessential  expenditures,  which  are  insufficient  to  offset  the  decline in  revenues \nand increased expenditures. Consequently, the revised estimates for the 2008 fiscal deficit are \nlarger.  If  development  partner  support  is  not  forthcoming,  the  Government  would  be  forced  to \ndraw  down  on  its  cash  balances  at  the  NBG\u2014a  deficit-financing  source  that  could  soon  be \ndepleted.  It  is  estimated  that,  with  exceptional  budget  support  of  around  $480  million  in  2008 \nand  $450  million  in  2009,  the  Government  will  be  able  to  keep  the  net  expenditure  cuts  to  a \ninimum  (at  the  levels  identified  in  Table  1).

In view of the post-conflict situation \n\n18. \nand the need for emergency assistance, the EAPCR combines several features, including \n \n\n  9\n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nEmergency  assistance  lending  modality.  Given  the  need  to  ensure  an \ncritica\neffective and adequate counter-cyclical fiscal response as well as to meet \nl \nfety  net  expen\nditures,  the  EAPCR  will  course \npost-conflict  transitional  sa\nelp finance \n(a) essential economic and social \nassistance through the budget to h\nexpenditures linked to the conflict, and (b) other essential expenditures under the \nGovernment\u2019s financing plan. As outlined above, Georgia faces significant fiscal \nstress  given \nthe  adverse  business \nenvironment,  conflict-related  expenditures  (IDPs  and  other  economic and  social \nneeds),  and  lower  privatization  receipts.  Hence,  ADB\u2019s  emergency  assistance \nloan  modality  that  is  designed  to  mitigate  immediate  losses  is  best  suited  to \nassist  Georgia.  The  EAPCR  satisfies  the  eligibility  criteria  for  an  emergency \nassistance  loan  (EAL)  under  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy \n(DEAP).5 See discussion in paras. 25\u201329 and Figure 2. \n\nlarge  revenue  shortfall  due \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nRelationship  between  cost  and  amount.

The loan will help the Government meet essential expenditures, \nincluding social and rehabilitation expenditures arising from the August conflict and contribute to \naddressing the current 2008 budget financing gap (Table 3).

Georgia  has  made  good  progress  in  implementing  public \n3\nfinancial  management  reforms  (Appendix  3).  These  reforms  have  been  integral  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  comprehensive  anticorruption  strategy  (Box  2).  The  findings  and  conclusions  of \nvarious assessments of Georgia\u2019s public financial management system have been incorporated \nwithin and are integral to the design of the EAPCR.10 Georgia\u2019s public expenditure management \nsystems continue to be used for budget support operations financed by the World Bank and the \nEU,  and  are  perceived  to  be  sufficiently  robust  from  a  fiduciary  standpoint.  On  this  basis,  the \npublic financial management, control, and reporting arrangements of the Government are also \nconsidered sufficiently robust for the EAPCR. These are adequately complemented by regular \nstate budget execution reporting mechanisms to the Parliament of Georgia. During each fiscal \nyear,  the  Chamber  of  Control  (COC)\u2013the  supreme  audit  institution  of  Georgia\u2014undertakes  an \naudit  of  all  public  expenditure  programs.  Moreover,  the  Government\u2019s  public  financial \npported  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  multi-donor  funded \nmanagement  reforms  continue  to  be  su\nublic  Sector  Financial  Management  Reform  Support  Project.  Since  the  funding  is  part  of  the \nP\nNA  financing  platform,  tracking  of  the  use  of  EAPCR  funds  will  be  closely  linked  with  results \nJ\nonitoring  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.

In  2004, \nalmost  every  element  of  the  Government\u2019s  reforms  included  an  anticorruption  agenda.  The  first  step \ne wholesale replacement of large sections of existing state institutions. To remove the old guard \nwas\nGovernment,  officials  were  fired  or  required  to  reapply  for  their  old  jobs.  To  reduce  incentives  for \ncorruption, salaries were raised.   \n\n th\n\n \n  To strengthen public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency, the Government adopted and \nbegan implementing reforms that cut across public expenditure management, fiduciary activities, and \npublic  administration.  Reforms  aimed  at  strengthening  budgeting  and  expenditure  management, \nincreasing  transparency  and  efficiency  in  public  procurement  and  financial  management  systems, \nstrengthening  public  administration,  and  enhancing  transparency  and  accountability  of  the  public \nsector.  Reforms  include  adoption  and  implementation  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework, \nimplementation  of  a  treasury  single  account,  restructuring  of  the  Chamber  of  Control  into  a  supreme \naudit  institution,  adoption  and  implementation  of  a  national  anticorruption  strategy,  broad-based \nanticorruption  monitoring,  and  civil  service  reforms,  among  others.  Implementation  of  these  reforms \nhelped  reduce  corruption.  According  to  the  World  Bank  Institute\u2019s  Governance  Indicators,  Georgia\u2019s \npercentile rank for control of corruption indicator has improved from 31.6% in 2004 to 48.3% in 2007.  \n\n \n  Sources:  World  Bank.  2008.

First,  it  will  help  the  Government  meet  new \nsocial  and  rehabilitation  expenditures  arising  from  the  August  conflict,  and  other  essential \nexpenditures,  through  the  budget.    Secondly,  the  EAPCR  aims  at  mitigating  the  impact  of  the \nconflict on the economy. The August conflict has resulted in a significant shock to the economic \ngrowth,  and  the  EAPCR  will  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  countercyclical  fiscal \nmeasures  aimed  at  checking  and  reversing  the  economic  downturn.  The  IMF  standby \narrangement  of  $750  million  for  18  months  provides  balance  of  payment  support  and  helps \nrt  from  development  partners  have  been \nmaintain  investor  confidence.  Indications  of  suppo\nubstantial  but  these  pledges  often  take  time  to  translate  into  the  delivery  of  resources. \ns\nTherefore, flexible and timely financing under the EAPCR is essential to address the budgetary \nneeds  of  the  social  safety  net,  speed  up  rehabilitation,  and  reduce  the  risks  of  the  economic \ndownturn. Appendix 7 presents the summary poverty reduction and social strategy prepared for \nthe EAPCR. \n \nB\n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n. \n\n40. \nThere are currently downside risks and significant uncertainty regarding the time frame \nfor  the  Georgian  economy  to  adjust  to  this  temporary  shock.  External  risks  include  the \n(i) protracted global credit crisis and recession, and (ii) rekindling of regional tensions. Domestic \nrisks include (i) increased economic difficulties could set back reforms, (ii) countercyclical fiscal \npolicy  insufficient  to  kick-start  growth,  and  (iii)  weakening  of  the  banking  sector.  The  external \nrisks are mitigated by several factors. First, while a protracted global credit crisis will likely mean \na  reduction  in  financial  flows  to  Georgia,  it  will  trigger  a  needed  refocus  on  strengthening  the \nregulatory  environment  for  the  financial  sector  and  increased  reliance  on  internal  deposit \nmobilization  by  banks.  The  deep  structural  reforms  of  the  last  4  years  have  increased  the \nresilience of the economy to adjust to external shocks. Second, in regard to the risk of increased \nregional tensions, intense efforts to reach a peaceful settlement are underway.  \n \n41. \nIn terms of mitigating factors for domestic risks, first, with regard to the risk of dissipation \nof  reform  momentum,  the  Government  launched  the  JNA  within  days  of  the  outbreak  of  the \nconflict  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  clear  strategy  for  keeping  the  focus  on  reforms  and  that  the \nnecessary resources for remaining on track are secured. Second, support proposed under the \nEAPCR is part of a broader stabilization p\nackage, which includes the IMF, the World Bank, and \nother  development  partners\u2014the  overall  impact  in  terms  of  ensuring  the  effectiveness  of  the \ncountercyclical  fiscal  policy  stance  is  thus  expected  to  be  positive.  In  regard  to  the  risk  of \nw\neakening  of  the  banking  sector,  earlier  capital  requirements  were  conservative  enough  to \na\nllow for the current counter-cyclical adjustments, and JNA development partners are expected \nto\n provide support to this sector.  \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n5\n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n42. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  work  with  ADB  and  other  JNA  development  partners  to \nmonitor results, track aid, and assess the impact of support under the JNA. \nThe Government shall update ADB on the implementation of the JNA and shall \nensure  that  necessary  support  is  provided  to  ADB  to  review  and  monitor  the \nstatus of key indicators under the design and monitoring framework.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  loan  proceeds  are  used  for  financing  its \nimmediate  budgetary  expenditures  arising  from  the  conflict  and  recurrent \nlivery \nbudgetary expenditures incurred after August 2008 inclusive, to sustain de\nof the Government\u2019s core publicly funded program, in compliance with its public \nfinance  management  procedures  and  reporting  arrangements,  and  that  such \nproceeds are not used to finance ineligible items as set forth in Appendix 6, and\n \nshall provide a certificate to ADB to this effect. \nThe  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  certified  copy  of  the  state  budget \nexecution  reports\n  for  2008  and  2009  as  submitted  to  the  Parliament  within  six \nmonths after the end of the relevant fiscal year, with a certified English translation\n \nof the relevant parts. The Government will furnish to ADB a certified copy of the\n \nopinion of the Chamber of Control on such reports within eleven months after the \nend of the relevant fiscal year, with a certified English translation of the relevant \nparts. \nThe Government will provide ADB with a certified copy, in the English language, \nof  the  externally  audited  annual  report  of  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for the fiscal years \n2008 and 2009 within six months after the end of the relevant fiscal year. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  are  complied  with  in  implementation \nof \nactivities financed from the proceeds of the loan. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nhe  special  features  described  in  pa\n\nns  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  o\n\n3. \nsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  th\nrovisio\n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n4\nA\ne  President,  under  the \np\nf  Agreement  of  ADB,  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  (with  t\nragraphs  25  through  29  above)  in \nvarious  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  46,879,000  to  Georgia  for  the \nEmergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 \nyears; with repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and \n4%  a  year  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in accordanc\ne \nwith those set fo\n \n \n\nrth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\nC.

The  capital  inflow  bonanza  helped  finance  the  large  current  account \ndeficit,  and  the  buildup  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  cushioned  against  shocks  affecting  the \ncurrent and capital accounts of the balance of payments. In view of the significant dollarization \nof the economy and incomplete lending channels for effectiveness of traditional monetary policy \ntools,  the  Government\u2019s  main  macroeconomic  stabilization  strategy  had  been  to  pursue \nexchange rate stabilization.

In  addition,  through  strong \nimprovements  in  tax  revenue  mobilization,  the  Government  has  been  able  to  reverse  its  past \nrecord of recurrent failures to meet tax revenue targets, accumulation of domestic expenditure \narrears (including on pensions and wages), and cash management problems. With tax revenues \nincreasing from 14.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to 25.8% of GDP in 2007, the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  increase  social  spending  (to  more  than  5%  of  GDP)  assisted  in \nestablishing  social  safety  nets,  which  the  Government  deems  crucial  for  attainment  of  its \ninclusive growth and poverty reduction agenda. Much-needed spending on priority items (e.g., \nkey infrastructural rehabilitation) also increased.  \n \n5. \nFollowing  years  of  sustained  growth,  the  August  conflict  has  resulted  in  an  uncertain \nnear-term  outlook  for  Georgia.

A  key  driver  for  this  is  the  loss  in \nb\nusiness confidence  seen  thus  far,  which  in  turn  will  affect  FDI  in  key  sectors  like  agriculture, \nto\nurism,  and  energy  infrastructure.  FDI  inflows  and  related  privatization  revenues,  as  well  as \np\nortfolio investment inflows, have already decelerated sharply.

This is \ncompounded by the consequences of erosion in consumer and investor confidence.

The  Law  on  State  Procurement,  2005,  was \nsubsequently  amended  to  include  state-owned  enterprises,  streamline  procedures,  and  adopt \ninternational practices of retroactive financing in public procurement. Since the adoption of the \nnew framework, public tenders have increased fivefold from 796 in 2005 to more than 3,500 in \n2007. The number is expected to rise further as the monitoring capacity of SPA increases.  \n \n5. \nThe  Government  adopted  a  new  law  on  local  government  budgets  and  a  transparent \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations  system  in  the  budget  preparation  process.  It  continues  to \nimplement the reformed system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers and the new law on local \ngovernment  budgets,  and  finalized  and  began  the  rollout  of  a  new  integrated  system  for \nmonitoring municipal budgeting and financial reporting. Until the August 2008 conflict, transfers \nwere  being  fully  funded\u2014while  the  conflict  has  reduced \nthe  flow,  the  Government  is  fully \nommitted  to  funding.

The  Government  has  also \ndefined mechanisms and set parameters for reviewing and assessing the implementation of the \nnew  tax  legislation,  and  introduced  amendments  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the  tax \nadministration.  As  a  result  of  these  reforms,  tax  revenues  increased  from  18%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2004 to 22% in 2006 and 25% in 2007. The qualitative improvement \nin tax policy has increased budget revenues and given the Government the opportunity to fund \npriority expenditures more effectively.  \n \n\nTable A3: Main Taxes and Tax Rates \n(%) \n\nTypes of Taxes \nIncome tax \n\nBefore 2005 \n12\u201320 \n\n2005\u20132007 \n12 \n\nSocial tax \n\nCorporate (profit) \ntax \nValue-added tax \nCustoms duty \n\n27\u201333 \n\n20 \n\n20 \n0\u201330 \n\n20 \n\n20 \n\n18 \n0, 5, 12 \n\n2008 \n25  \n(unified with social tax in 2008 with stepwise \nreduction  to 15% by 2011) \nAbolished \n(merged with personal income tax) \n15 \n\n18 \n0, 5, 12 \n\n      Sources: ADB staff; United Nations Development Program. 2008.

Efforts are under way to build the necessary infrastructure of tax administration to \nimprove  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  taxpayer  services.  Regional  service  houses  have  been \nestablished to  provide  taxpayers  with  instructions  and  guidance,  and  several  large  tax  service \ncenters are under rehabilitation.  \n \n8. \nThe Government adopted a new Customs Code, which simplified customs requirements \nsignificantly,  reorganized  and  re-staffed  the  Customs  Department,  and  abolished  the  import \ntariff on almost 91% of items; on other items, the simple unweighted import tariff fell from 7.4% \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n 25\n\ned\n\nures involved in importing and exp\n\n4  to  1.4%  in  2007.

According to Doing Business 2008,3 the costs and \norting a standardized shipment of goods in Georgia is \nproc\nin line with practices in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \ncountries.  Recently,  the  Government  reviewed  and  assessed  the  performance  of  the  new \nCustoms  Code  and  made  recommendations  to  improve  performance  and  service  standards. \nSeveral  customs  checkpoints  have  been  restructured.  Electronic  value-added  tax  declarations \nhave been implemented and the ASYCUDA WORLD system4 has been operationalized in pilot \ncheckpoints. The customs methodology has also been revised. Customs procedures have been \nfurther  simplified  and  risk-based  inspection  methodologies  fully  introduced.  The  Government \nintends  to  continue  development  and  reporting  of  standard  performance  indicators  to  monitor \nperformance and the progress with the reforms.  \n \n9. \nIn  summary,  reforms  have  resulted  in  impressive  increases  in  revenue  collection.  This \nhas  allowed  the  Government  to  start  addressing  basic  infrastructure  needs,  which  were \nessential to expand business opportunities. Georgia has substantially improved its rank among \nthe \u201cDoing Business\u201d indicators, rising from 114th place in 2005 to 37th place in 2006 and 18th \nplace  in  2007.  T\nhe  2007  Doing  Business  survey  ranked  Georgia  as  the  number  one  reformer \nlobally.  Reforms  have  continued  and  Georgia  has  been  ranked  15th  in  2008.  Significant \ng\nimprovements  in  the  business  environment  were  key  to  the  surge  in  foreign  direct  investment \ninflows from under $200 million (non-oil pipeline) in 2005 to $1.5 billion in 2007.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Protection \n\nPayment to beneficiaries under Georgia\u2019s first targeted social assistance (TSA) program \n10. \ncommenced in August 2006. Each household was thoroughly examined and assigned a score \nof need. This database is used to target various programs for the poor and vulnerable, including \na  health  insurance  program.  Under  the  Government\u2019s  2008  budget,  GEL113.1  million  (an \nincrease  over  the  GEL83  million  budgeted  for  2007)  was  allocated  to  finance  the  TSA.  As  of \nAugust  2008,  the  TSA  program  benefits  148,279  households  (12.6%  of  all  households  in \nGeorgia), with 406,718 members (10.7% of the population), which received an average monthly \nbenefit of GEL50.92 per month. The total spending on targeted income support was budgeted at \nGEL113.1  million  for  2008  (0.6%  of  projected  GDP).  The  August  conflict  with  the  Russian \nFederation  (conflict)  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  number  of  people  requiring  social \nassistance. With regard to the population vulnerable to poverty because of the conflict, including \nthe  new  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs),  the  Government  is  planning  to  support  qualified \new extreme poor in the TSA (assuming that \npersons through the TSA. The cost of including all n\none  of  them  are  currently  benefiting)  ranges  from  GEL1.53  million  per  month  to  GEL3.06 \nn\nmillion  per  month,  if  the  benefit  level  is  about  GEL17  per  capita  per  month.  In  addition,  about \n25,000  IDP  households  will  receive  one-off  cash  assistance.  The  social  protection  system  will \ncontinue  to  face  increasing  pressures  as  economic  conditions  tighten  and  the  number  of \nunemployed and those who have lost the means to sustain their livelihoods increase.5  \n \n11. \nGeorgia  has  a  universal  system  of  income  support  for  the  elderly,  where  eligibility  is \nthreshold  (60  for  women  and  65  for  men).  Other \nconditioned  upon  reaching  a  certain  age \nategories  covered  by  the  system  are  people  with  disabilities  and  families  who  have  lost  a \nc\nbreadwinner. Benefits are flat (currently GEL70 per month) except for some special categories, \nwhich  receive  higher  benefits  (war  veterans,  retired  officers  from  the  army  and  Ministry  of \n                                                 \n3   World Bank. 2007.

Overall,  in  August  2008,  838,130  people  receive  pensions. \nTotal  spending  on  pensions  and  special  categories  benefits  in  2008  is  budgeted  at  GEL773.5 \nmillion (state pensions GEL722.7 million and special allowances GEL50.8 million). The August \nconflict has not had any adverse effect on the delivery of pensions thus far. \n \nalth \n12. \nThe  health  care  system  in  Georgia  continues  to  face  significant  challenges.  He\nervice utilization rates are the lowest in Europe and Central Asia, with less than two outpatient \ns\nvisits per capita and less than five inpatient visits per 100 people. Out of pocket expenditures for \ntreatment are a major barrier to seeking care. Only 43% of the poorest quintile seeks care for \nchronic illnesses compared to 62% of the richest quintile, and 73% of the chronically ill cite lack \nof resources as the main reason for not utilizing health services. Three million Georgians\u2014out \nof  a  population  of  4.4  million\u2014need  to  cover  almost  three  quarters  of  their  expenditures  on \nhealth  services  through  out-of-pocket  payments. 6  Illness  is  one  of  the  causes  of  falling  into \npoverty,  as  10%  more  individuals  fall  below  the  poverty  line  after  incurring  hospitalization \nexpenses.  \n \n \n13. \nThe Government has launched an ambitious 4-year plan to improve equity and access\n  essential  quality  health  services,  especially  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  Specifically,  the \nto\nckage of health care services with universal coverage for \nGov ment defined a basic benefit pa\nall  of  the  population,  and  introduced  a  medical  assistance  program  (MAP)  of  comprehensive \nhealth care services for the poor. All households who qualify for TSA and whose score is below \n70,000  qualify  for  the  MAP\u2014a  package  of  medical  services  provided  to  beneficiaries  through \npublicly  financed  insurance  premium  bought  through  private  insurance  companies  (currently \nGEL11 per beneficiary per month). The MAP covers (i) outpatient services not provided by the \nprimary  health  care  program;  and  (ii)  a  range  of  inpatient  services,  including  costs  of \nchemotherapy and radiation therapy, and labor and delivery costs. The program has been found \nto  increase  utilization  of  health  services  by  the  poor.  It  currently  has  about  750,000 \nbeneficiaries.  In  parallel,  the  Government  increased  budgetary  allocations  to  the  health  care \nsector  in  the  MTEF  2007\u20132010.  For  2008,  the  amount  budgeted  is  GEL75  million,  about  one \nlth. As a result of the conflict, the cost of providing new \nthird of overall public spending on hea\nPs with the medical assistance package amounts to an additional GEL1 million\u2013GEL2 million \nID\nper month, assuming the cos\n\nt per capita of GEL11.2 per month. \n\nern\n\n                                                 \n6   World Bank.

In  2004,  a  reform-\nminded  Government  came  into  power  and  ushered  in  significant  political  and  economic \ndevelopments  (the  Rose  Revolution).  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  reform  agenda  is \nreflected  in  the  budget  document  Basic  Data  and  Directions  for  2007\u20132010,  which  was  first \ndeveloped  in  2005  and  updated  annually  since  then.2  The  budget  document  emphasizes  the \nneed to improve governance and reduce corruption, and is premised on the development of a \ndynamic and competitive private sector as the main engine of growth, with the state playing a \nsupportive role by providing basic public goods and services. Complementary reforms are also \nenvisaged  t\no  ensure  that  the  population  benefits  from  growth  through  improvements  in \nducation  and  health  care  delivery,  and  the  introduction  of  a  well-targeted  social safety  net  to \ne\nprotect the extreme poor. These institutional and structural reforms are supported by prudential \nmacroeconomic policies.  \n \n2. \nFollowing the presidential elections in January 2008 and the formation of a new cabinet, \nthe  Government  issued  a  5-year  program  of  key  priorities  for  2008\u20132012\u2014\u201cUnited  Georgia \nwithout  Poverty,\u201d  which  was  approved  by  Parliament  on  31  January  2008. 3     The  program  \nidentifies a number of economic, political, and social objectives including (i) social programs\u2014\nspending  one  third  of  the  state  budget  to  spend  on  social  programs  for  the  next  5  years; \n(ii) employment generation\u2014creating 200,000 new jobs over the next 5 years; and (iii) reducing \npoverty\u2014halving the number of social program beneficiaries in the next 5 years, increasing the \nminimum monthly pension to $100 over the next 5 years; and providing access to state-funded \nhealth insurance for 1.2 million people, including socially vulnerable, teachers, military and law \nenforcement personnel, and employees of state agencies.4\n \n3. \nimpressive results.

Official  poverty \nAn  assessment  of  the  impact  of  economic\n  in  2005  to \nhe  overall  poverty  rate  declining  from  24\ni\nndicators  show  some  improvement  over  2005\u20132007, \nwi\nd turnover in \n23.3% in 2006 and 21.3% in 2007. However, the quality of\ne data is a concern, stemming partly from r\nstaff  in the  Statistics  Department.  As  a  cross-check,  the  orld  Bank  and  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  S\nn \nrement  survey  in  Fa   2007,  and  preliminary  analysis  of  the  res lts  shows  an \ncond\nssment  in  early  FY2009  will  discuss  the  differences,  and \noverall  poverty  rate  of  23.6%  for  2007.  A  full  poverty  as\nsuggest  strategic  policy  and  investment  options  for  pov\nons  can  be \ny  reduction  efforts.  However,  some  obser\nmade \n.  The  rapid  increase  in  social  spending,  including  the  introduction  of  the  targeted  social  assistance \nprogram  in  2006,  has  likely  improved  the  situation  of  th   extreme  poor.  Additionally,  poverty  appears  to  be  more \ne\nconce\n \nThe conflict that erupted in August 2008 has resulted to an additional 130,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), of \nwhich about 40,000 may not be able to return to their homes in the conflict zone. In addition, around 150,000 people \nliving  on  farms  on  the  agricultural  plain  north  of  Gori  are  suffering  from  severe  crop  and  livestock  losses  because \ni\nrrigation water was cut off and other conflict-related damage. Prelimi\nnary estimates point to unemployment increasing \nfrom  13.3%  in  2007  to  15.1%\u201317.4%  in  2008. The  near-term  outlook  is  of  a  rise  in  unemployment  of  up  to  100,000. \nDepending  on  the  severity  of  the  economic  impact  of  the  conflict,  it  is  estimated  that  around  100,000\u2013280,000 \nGeorgians  may  fall  into  poverty  by  the  end  of  2009,  increasing  the  overall  poverty  incidence  from  23.6%  in  2007c  to \n25.9%\u201330.0% and the extreme poverty incidence from 9.3% to 11.3%\u201313.4%.d People who are already poor might be \npushed deeper into poverty, thus increasing the overall poverty gap and severity of poverty. \n \nThe poverty impact estimates stem from (i) projected effects of the loss of property, productive assets, and livelihood, \nas well as the displacement that was caused by the conflict, some of which is expected to be permanent; and (ii) the \n\n  growth  and  so\nth  t\n th\nW\nll\nse\nert\n\n.1%\napi\nocial  Protectio\nu\n\n    Targeting Classification: General Inte ention \n\nucted  a  living  standards  measu\n\neas and secondary cities. \n\nesources for the EAPCR. \n\nADB\u2019s Special Funds r\n\nntrated in rural ar\n\nat  this  time\n\nh\nap\n\nconsi\n\n      \n\ntion\n\nvati\n\nrv\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n  33\n\ngu\n\n to d\n\nbility\n\ne cur\n\ntion). \n\nocial  a\n\nerable po\n\nhe popula\n\nlds (10% of t\n\nupport\nechan\n\n  house\nal wo\n\nng  me\nn the p\n\ngistered \ned da\n\nould  become  much  deeper\n\nholds  had  re\nrker who collect\n\neholds\u2014by 72% for all poor househ\n\nght  have  on the overall Georgian eco\n\n  Government\u2019s \nal \nrized \n\neliver social transfer and services, further aggravating the social situation. \n\nand potential loss of jobs and household incomes.

Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social sectors in Georgia were confronted with a number of structural, institutional, policy, and governance issues \ne\nprograms \nthat needed to be addressed to improve performance an\ny  poor.  M over,  they  were  thinly  spread  over  too  ma\nny \nwere  insufficient  to  m\nake  a  real  difference  to  the  e\nre\nxtrem\nfragmented  programs,  targeted  mostly  based  on  status,  merits  (vetera\nns  and  other  deserving  citizens),  or  a  so\ncial \nn was weak, the staff were poorly trained and paid, \ncategory (disabled, orphans, elderly, etc.). Program implem\nthe record-keeping practice was outdated, \nmonitoring and evaluation barely \nexisted.  \n \nEven  though  social  transfers  are  not  sufficient  to  move  households  out  of  poverty,  they  play  an  important  role  in \npoverty alleviation (particularly pensions as the largest program). The new Government inherited significant arrears in \npensions  and  other  social  benefit  payments.  In  the  short  to  medium  term,  major  challenges  facing  the  state  pension \nsystem are (i) to continue paying pensions on time, (ii) to increase pensions to about 25%\u201330% of the average wage \n(from a replacement rate of about 20%), and (iii) to improve pension administration. In the long run, Georgia faces a \nchallenge  of  developing  an  affordable,  fiscally  sustainable,  diversified  pension  system  that  would  protect  the  elderly \nagainst poverty and provide for consumption smoothing. Under the new Government\u2019s program, pensions and social \nassistance benefits were significantly increased, all arrears were cleared, and payment of these benefits commenced \non  a  regular  basis.  In  pensions,  a  strategy  for  long-term  pension  reform  was  adopted,  and  the  corresponding  legal \nframework  was created for an affordable, equitable, and fiscally sustainable protection of the elderly  against poverty. \nOverall, the pension system was simplified and streamlined. \n \nThe  health  sector  continues  to  face  significant  challenges.  Health  outcomes  are  stagnant  or  are  worsening.  Early \nchildhood mortality and maternal mortality have  yet to show  a positive trend. Noncommunicable diseases are on the \nrise. Out-of-pocket expenditures for treatment are still a major barrier to seeking care. The new Government\u2019s program \naims to sustain improved health care services. Increased public financing for health care and better targeting of primary \ncare to the poor are gradually improving the utilization of health care services.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  conflict  on  Georgians  living  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  has  been  considerable.  Their  lives  have \nsuddenly been uprooted and the future is uncertain for many of them. Damages have been amplified by the massive \ndisplacement of people. The longer-term impacts, if not addressed promptly, may be sizeable. Human capital and the \ncountry\u2019s social fabric could be weakened and private sector activity in the affected areas severely hampered. Those \nalready  poor  might  fall  deeper  into  poverty,  and  many  of  the  newly  vulnerable  may  become  poor.  The  affected \npopulation is largely rural and poor. As with the rest of the population, the poor will be supported through the targeted \nsoc l assistance program; it is important that equity considerations require identical treatment of the poor. The conflict\n \nled to a rise in the number requiring social assistance, thereby adding to the administrative burden. It is estimated that \nan additional 100,000 people who have been affected by the conflict, directly or indirectly, are now vulnerable and thus \nin need of social protection assistance. A possible economic deceleration, combined with increasing food prices, would \nlead to a deepening of poverty and food insecurity among the vulnerable. The costs of the targeted social assistance \nprogram will rise and the proposed assistance will help address these budgetary impacts. \n \n\nia\n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.

Manila. \n  Using consumption as a  welfare indicator and following World Bank methodology for poverty measurement, 23.6% of\n \nGeorgians were found to be poor and 9.3% very poor. The rural population was poorer than the urban: 29.7% versus \n18.3%  for  overall  poverty  and  12.4%  versus  6.7%  in  the  case  of  extreme  poverty.  Poverty  in  Georgia  is  thus \n \npredominantly  rural\u2014it  makes  59%  of  the  total  poor  and  62%  of  the  extreme  poor.  The  incidence  of  poverty  varies\n \nconsiderably across Georgia. The highest incidence is observed in Shida Kartli (59.4%), followed by Kakheti (46.3%),\n.9%),  Samegrelo  (14.4%),  and \nand  Mtskheta-\nKvemo-Kartli  (17.3%).  Employment  status  is  strongly  correlated  with  poverty.  Households  headed  by  wage  earners\n \nexperience the lowest rates of overall poverty (12.7%) and extreme poverty (4.4%). Among the employed, households\n \nheaded by the self-employed in agriculture face the highest poverty risk. In contrast, households headed by someone \nw\n\nMtianeti  (40.6%).  The  lowest  incidence  of  poverty  is  found  in  Tbilisi  (12\n\nho is unemployed or out of the labor force face a subst\n\nantial risk of poverty. \n\n  An alternative estimate of the poverty impact of the conflict was simulated using the 2007 living standard measurement\n \nsurvey  data  set  and  assuming  that  the  purchasing  power  of  the  population  clustered  above  the  poverty  lines  would\n \ndecline by 5%, 10%, and 20%. If the purchasing power declines by 5%, the extreme poverty rate would rise to 10.4%\n \nand the overall poverty rate would incr\nease to 26.3%.
