They were important bases for coal-mining and \nelectricity production in the PRC particularly between 1949 and 2013.4  Their fundamental reliance \non  coal  mining  and  related  industries  made  their  economies  vulnerable,  especially  when  coal \nprices  dropped  steeply  in  2013.  Changing  global  and  domestic  energy  and  climate  change \npolicies  also  contributed  to  rapid  economic  decline,  wage  reductions,  unemployment,  urban \npoverty, and population loss in the project cities.6 In 2014, the project cities had a per capita gross \ndomestic product that was 33% lower than the average rate in Heilongjiang Province, which in \nturn was 16% below the national average. Economic revitalization is challenging because of the \nlack of (i) effective programs for SME development, (ii) SME financing for investments and longer-\nterm  working  capital,  (iii)  investments  in  competitive  products  and  research  and  development, \n(iv) capacity  to  develop  and  expand  businesses,  (v)  strategic  workforce  development,  and \n(vi) attractive urban environments and services. A further challenge to strengthening the private \nsector is a long tradition of large state-owned enterprises dominating the local economies. \n \n4. \nThe project cities suffer from environmental degradation (pollution of soil, water, and air) \ncaused by more than 60 years of coal mining. This, along with inadequate urban infrastructure \nand  services\u2014e.g.,  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  drainage,  and  district  heating \nsystems\u2014makes for  poor  livability.  Key  missing  links  in  the  road  network  lead to  detours  and \ntraffic congestion, especially in Shuangyashan. Project cities lack adequate road maintenance, \npublic transport, bus lanes, bus stops, and sidewalks; and urgently need road rehabilitation. Some \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB has been conducting policy dialogue and providing project support for urban environmental improvement and \n\nwater pollution for more than 20 years in Heilongjiang Province. \n\n3  ADB.  2015.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Heilongjiang  Coal-Rich  Cities \n\nRedevelopment. Manila.  \n\n4  Heilongjiang Provincial Government. 2016. Heilongjiang Statistical Yearbook, 2015. Harbin. \n6  After 255,000 people out-migrated during 2010\u20132015, the population declined by 4.7%. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nrivers, especially in Hegang and Jixi, flood during heavy storms, have narrow channels, and are \npolluted by sediments and untreated discharge of domestic and industrial wastewater. \n\n \n5. \nValue  added  by  Asian  Development  Bank  assistance.  ADB  helped  identify  and \ncomprehensively address key economic development challenges through non-coal diversification, \nand  sustainable  and  inclusive  private  sector  development  and  job  creation.  It  mobilized \ncofinancing  to  tackle  public  funding  shortages,  enabling  a  holistic  investment  project  that  will \ngenerate cross-sector synergies. It prepared a diversification road map and an SME development \nand financing program to leverage ADB funds and strengthen the local finance sector.7 It prepared \ninitial mining remediation strategies and identified pilot projects to improve the environment and \npublic health, and initiate a transformation from a negative image as dirty coal cities to clean and \ngreen cities. ADB identified key needs for urban infrastructure and services improvement, to help \nretain and attract people, companies, and jobs. ADB assessed climate risk and vulnerability, and \nproposed adaptation measures to help make the project cities more resilient to climate change.  \n \n6. \nStrategic fit. The project builds on more than 20 years of partnership between ADB and \nHeilongjiang Province, including several strategic priority projects, such as, reducing pollution and \nflood  risk  in  the  Songhua  River  Basin  involving  both  public  and  private  sectors  support. 8 The \nproject is part of a renewed commitment to support government strategies to revitalize the PRC\u2019s \neconomically  challenged  northeastern  region.  Through  its  strategic  and  holistic  approach,  the \nproject will support the (i) Thirteenth Five-Year plans of the governments of the PRC, Heilongjiang \nProvince, and project cities to transform the economy and improve financing of new industries \nand SMEs;10 (ii) Transformation Development Planning of Coal Cities in Heilongjiang Province, \n2014\u20132020  by  assisting  SMEs  in  non-coal  pillar  industries,  including  green  food  processing, \ngraphite  high-tech  materials  and  products,  machinery,  tourism,  trade,  and  logistics;  and                 \n(iii) National New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020 by strengthening small- and medium-sized \ncities.11 The project aligns with ADB policies, including the (i) Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, \nthrough knowledge provision, support for the development of the private and finance sectors, and \nincreased partnership-based cofinancing and operations;12 (ii) country partnership strategy for the \nPRC, 2016\u20132020, by supporting socially inclusive, environmentally sustainable, and economically \ncompetitive  urban  development; 13  and  (iii)  urban,  water,  and  finance  sector  and  sustainable \ntransport initiative operational plans; and environment operational directions.14 \n\n                                                \n7  Finance sector development includes (i) developing the capacity of local commercial financial intermediaries in green \nfinancing, (ii) facilitating medium- to longer-term SME project financing and reducing collateral requirements, and \n(iii) strengthening capacity in cash-flow-based lending and risk management for SMEs. \n\n8  ADB. 2003.

The project will have the following outcome: non-coal \neconomic activities and urban livability in project cities increased. \n \nThrough  its  comprehensive  urban  and  economic  revitalization  approach,  the  project  is \n8. \nexpected to help stop and reverse the out-migration of younger qualified workforce, and draw and \nretain residents and companies to more attractive project cities. The project will directly benefit \n2.73  million  urban  residents  through  (i) stronger  SME  competitiveness  and  jobs  creation  in \nimproved non-coal industrial parks; (ii) improved environment and public image through mining \nremediation; (iii) improved water supply, sewerage, district heating, flood protection, roads, road \nsafety, and public transport; (iv) greater environmental and traffic safety awareness through public \neducation programs; and (v) increased cooperation between project cities in tourism promotion, \nlogistics and trade, supply chain integration, and SME support using smart city applications. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1) and in the project administration manuals (PAMs).15 \n \n10. \nOutput  1:  Capacity  in  business  development  services  and  integrated  project \nplanning  and  management  developed.  This  output  will  support  project  management  and \ncapacity development to ensure successful diversification and project sustainability in areas of    \n(i) project planning, procurement, and financial management; (ii) BDS for SMEs and local SME \nbureaus;  (iii) human  resources  and  skills  development;  (iv) smart  city  cluster  cooperation;             \n(v)  mining  remediation  planning  and  implementation;  (vi) flood  risk  management,  climate \nresilience,  and  sponge  city  planning; 16 (vii) water,  wastewater,  and  drainage  system  design, \nconstruction, and operation; and (viii) sustainable urban and public transport management and \nroad safety. \n \n11. \nOutput 2: Sustainable small- and medium-sized enterprises investment and access \nto  finance  in  project  cities  improved.  The  project  will  establish  an  SME  financing  platform, \nusing the  FIC, to mobilize domestic financing.17 The platform  will  offer  (i)  cofinancing  loans for \nSME investments by financial intermediaries in which the ADB loan component is subordinated \nin return for longer-term project loans, (ii) a first-loss cash collateral facility to mobilize commercial \nguarantees and ease access to commercial financing for investments and longer-term working \ncapital of up to 3 years,18 and (iii) entrusted loans for high-priority projects for local governments. \nThe FIC will be linked to the BDS subcomponent (output 1). \n\nThe  project  will  have  five outputs.  Detailed  descriptions are  included  in the  design  and \n\n                                                \n15 Project  Administration  Manual:  Investment  Project  Components  (Section  A)  [PAM  (Section  A)],  and  Project \nAdministration Manual: Financial Intermediation Component and Business Development Services Subcomponent \n(Section B) [PAM (Section B)] (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n16 Sponge city is a concept of comprehensive urban water resources management,  in which greenways, parks, and \nwetlands maximize ecosystem services, including stormwater management, using ecosystems-based adaptation.  \n17 Output 2 will be implemented through subprojects by SMEs, selected according to criteria described in PAM (Section \nB). The financial intermediation modality is most appropriate for aggregate projects facilitating diversification to non-\ncoal industries through SMEs, for which financing requirements are not large enough to allow direct lending by ADB. \n18 The cash collateral facility will cover (i) first loss of 20% for a guarantee company to assume risk for 80% of SME loan \nexposure and thus facilitate longer-term (3\u20135 years) debt financing by local financial intermediaries, and (ii) straight \nloans for higher-risk project loans in priority sectors. \n\n \n\n\fSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n12. \nOutput 3: Key infrastructure and small- and medium-sized enterprises facilities in \nnon-coal  industrial  parks  in  project  cities  constructed.  The  project  will  build  and  make \noperational key infrastructure and facilities, including (i) roads with advanced safety features and \nassociated utility pipes; (ii) industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs); and (iii) multifunction \nfacilities for SMEs and start-ups, as well as for training and business services. \n \n13. \nOutput 4: Remediation and environmental cleanup from mining impacts in project \ncities  improved.  The  project  will  develop  mining  remediation  strategies,  prepare  investment \nplans, and implement pilot demonstration projects as models for replication. In Hegang, an open-\npit mine will be remediated involving grading, clay lining, topsoil cover, vegetation, environmental \nmanagement, and monitoring. The site will be reclaimed, made accessible and reused as a park \nand for light industry. In Jixi, a former mining area and waste-rock dumpsite, will be afforested, \nand a subsidence monitoring center will be built and operated.19 In Qitaihe and Shuangyashan, \nwaste-rock dumpsites and subsidence areas will be remediated and reused as open spaces. \n \n14. \nOutput 5: Integrated urban infrastructure and services in project cities  improved. \nThis output will enhance urban livability and attractiveness through improved, spatially integrated \ninfrastructure and services: (i) Hegang\u2014river rehabilitation, drainage system, sustainable urban \nand  public  transport,  urban greening,  and  district  heating;  (ii)  Jixi\u2014integrated  improvements  to \nthe core area of Hengshan District and West Jixi, including river rehabilitation, urban roads, water \nsupply, wastewater management, and drainage system; (iii) Qitaihe\u2014water supply, wastewater \nsystem, and public transport system improvements; and (iv) Shuangyashan\u2014sustainable urban \ntransport by building key missing road links, water supply, sewerage, and drainage systems. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,021.0  million  equivalent  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost \nestimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the  PAMs.  The  major \nexpenditure items are civil works, equipment and its installation, FIC, and consulting services. \n \n16. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $310 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and \nother  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan);  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  Based  on  the  custom-tailored \nrepayment  method, the average maturity  is  15.20 years,  and  the maturity  premium  payable to \nADB is 0.10% per year. \n \n17. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil  works,  equipment  and  its  installation,  capacity  building,  and  project  management.  The \nEuropean  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  will  provide  loan  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $220 million  not \nadministered  by  ADB. 20  EIB  will  cofinance  the  expenditures  in  relation  to  civil  works,  and \nequipment and its installation for outputs 4 and 5. \n \n \n                                                \n19 Subsidence is lateral or vertical ground movement and failure caused by the underground coal mines. \n20 EIB cofinancing will be on a joint collaborative basis and not administered by ADB. However, EIB will contribute to \nthe  financing  of  the  same  components  and contracts  as  ADB.  The  exact  amount of  EIB  cofinancing  is still  to  be \nfinalized at their Board meeting, expected later in December 2017. However, the total amount of financing will be \nsufficient to implement the project as described.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nInvestment Project Components\u2014Base Costb \n1.

It will \nalso  strengthen  the  risk  control  capacities  of  financial  intermediaries  and  support  the \nimplementation of an environmental and social management system (ESMS). Outputs are (i) SME \nperformance and weaknesses identified during the subloan repayment period monitored, (ii) SME \nperformance improvement action plan and capacity building plan developed, (iii) capacity of SMEs \nin  implementing  corrective  measures  improved,  and  (iv)  capacity  of  financial  intermediaries  in \nimplementing ESMS improved. ADB will administer the TA. The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, \nof which $450,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other  sources),  and  $300,000  will  be financed on  a grant  basis  by  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Partnership Special Fund.24 The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and other \nin-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  technically  feasible  and  complies  with  the  PRC\u2019s  and  international \nengineering  standards,  local  regulations  and  conditions,  and  strategic  and  sector  priorities. \nDesign  options  were  compared  and  the  best  possible  technologies  with  the  least  cost, \nenvironmental,  and  social  impacts  selected.

The  proposed  capacity  development  is  based  on  a  needs \nassessment for the successful implementation and sustainable operation of project facilities. \n \nThe  FIC  will  finance  SME  subprojects  in  the  project  cities,  which  will  contribute  to \n24. \neconomic revitalization and diversification away from coal. Detailed subproject selection criteria, \ncovering  technical,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards,  were  agreed  with  the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  project  cities  (with  support  of  the  financial  intermediaries)  must \nprepare  an  appraisal  report  to  verify  each  subproject\u2019s  compliance  with  the  defined  selection \ncriteria  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  no-objection  before  approving  a  subproject  under  the  first  batch. \nDetailed guidelines on subproject screening and appraisal are provided in the PAM (Section B). \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic analysis. An economic analysis for all investment loan subcomponents was \nprepared  following  ADB  guidelines.25 Economic  viability  of  the  overall  project  was  confirmed \nunder  various  sensitivity  scenarios.  Benefits  considered  include  (i)  improved  water  supply, \nwastewater  management,  and  sanitation;  (ii)  improved  flood  protection  and  avoided  damage;  \n(iii) increased savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time; and (iv) improved public health \nwith  less  productivity  losses  and  reduced  medical  costs.  Additional  benefits  include  increased \nSME employment,  reduced  carbon  emission  from  mining  remediation,  increased  carbon \nsequestration from afforestation, and reduced exposure to pathogens. The economic internal rate \nof return was calculated at 15.4% (above the 9.0% economic opportunity cost of capital), which \ndrops to 14.3% if the capital cost increases by 10.0%, 15.3% if the operating cost increases by \n10.0%, 14.0% with a 10.0% benefit decrease, 12.8% when combining these assumptions, and \n15.2% with a 1-year delay in the achievement of benefits. \n \n26. \nFinancial  analysis.  A  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  all  revenue-generating \nsubcomponents, and the project is considered financially feasible. The financial internal rate of \nreturn was calculated in real terms at 3.67% for the Hegang WWTP, 3.72% for Hegang\u2019s district \nheating, 3.27% for the Jixi WWTP, 8.46% for Jixi\u2019s water supply, and 3.94% for Qitaihe\u2019s water \nsupply. These rates exceed the weighted average costs of capital of 0.79% for the Hegang WWTP, \n1.39% for Hegang\u2019s district heating, 1.38% for the Jixi WWTP, 1.08% for Jixi\u2019s water supply, and \n1.64%  for  Qitaihe\u2019s  water  supply.  The  rates  remain  robust  under  various  sensitivity  scenarios. \nFiscal analysis concluded that the project cities are likely to require support from the provincial \ngovernment  to  meet  shortfalls  in  counterpart  contributions,  as  well  as,  for  debt  servicing  and \noperation and maintenance of project facilities. \n \n27. \nDue diligence. For the FIC, due diligence was conducted on financial institutions that will \npartner with the project cities, i.e., HBC, LBC, and Xinzheng Guarantee Company.26 The entities \nare  financially  viable  and  can  meet  financial  obligations  and  debt  service  payments  without \ndifficulty. A debt sustainability assessment was conducted for the project cities, and the financial \nstanding is assessed as sufficiently robust to absorb credit risks, and interest rate and exchange \nrate fluctuation risks. Integrity due diligence showed the  entities complying with ADB\u2019s integrity \nstandards. \n \n\n                                                \n25 ADB.  2017.

This risk will be mitigated through project implementation \nsupport described in the risk management plan, summarized in Table 4. For the FIC, the overall \nrisk is moderate. The assessment considered the capacity of the project cities, HBC, LBC, and \nXinzheng Guarantee Company, including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting, financial \nreporting  and  information  systems,  and  auditing.  The  result  shows  adequate  financial \nmanagement systems for project implementation. HBC and LBC comply with the regulations of \nthe China Banking and Regulatory Commission. A risk mitigation action plan is provided in the \nPAMs. \n \nThe  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  Given  its  experience  with  ADB  projects,  HPG  will \n29. \nsupervise  the  PIUs  that  currently  lack  experience.  The  procurement  arrangement  is  deemed \nadequate, since a tendering agency and consultants under output 1 will provide support during \nimplementation. For the FIC, procurement will use commercial practices acceptable to ADB and \nwill  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  on  financial \nintermediation loans. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith HPG; the Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan municipal governments; HBC; LBC; and \nthe  Xinzheng  Guarantee  Company.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAMs. \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting SME development and job \ncreation,  and  by  improving  infrastructure  and  services,  public  health,  sanitation,  and  living \nconditions. The project will create 1,853 skilled and 5,430 unskilled jobs during construction, and \n398 skilled and 138 unskilled jobs during operation. The PMOs will prioritize vulnerable groups, \nsuch as women and the poor, for employment and training. A social and gender action plan was \nprepared to ensure that positive benefits of the project accrue to beneficiaries. \n \n32. \nGender benefits. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Women are \naffected by unemployment and poor urban services, and consider improvements in road safety \nand public transport as important benefits to their  well-being and quality of life. The social and \ngender action plan will improve women\u2019s employment opportunities, and provide consultation and \nparticipation opportunities. It will raise awareness on environmental protection, road safety, and \nflood risk management through public education. The FIC will provide loans to SMEs and start-\nup companies owned and/or managed by women. Social development and gender specialists will \nsupport project implementation. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nsafeguard categories are as follows.27 \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  project\u2019s \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n27 ADB.

An  environmental  impact  assessment  and  environmental \n34. \nmanagement plan were prepared in compliance with the SPS, and disclosed on the ADB website \non 22 May 2017.28 Overall, the project will generate positive impacts on the environment. Impacts \nduring  construction  include  earthworks  and  movement;  and  treatment  of  soil,  polluted  river \nsediment, and contaminated soil from coal processing. Construction will have temporary impacts \non soil, surface water, air, and community safety but will not cause loss of valuable ecology or \nphysical  cultural  resources.  Impacts  during  operation  include  an  increase  in  traffic  on  project \nroads.  For  some  identified  locations,  noise  levels  may  exceed  the  PRC  standards.  The \nenvironmental  management  plan  includes  measures  to  avoid  and/or  mitigate  impacts  during \nconstruction and operation, and deal with potential subsidence and leachate release at mining \nremediation sites. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). There were four resettlement plans prepared in \n35. \nline with the SPS, as well as, government laws and regulations on involuntary resettlement. About \n318 households (1,075 persons) will be permanently affected by impacts on collective farm land \n(908.37 mu).29 Impacts on households and annual per capita income are found to be marginal \nwith loss at no more than 10%. About 296 households (700 persons) will be affected by house \ndemolition and relocation. About 6 organizations (1,530 workers) and 10 stores (32 persons) will \nbe  affected  by  impacts  on  structures.  Impacts  will  be  further  investigated  after  detailed \nmeasurement  surveys.  Each  PMO  has  designated  resettlement  staff  and  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism. The project implementation consultants will provide training and support. \n \n36. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Ethnic  minorities  account  for  less  than  4%  of  the \npopulation in project cities. Due diligence confirmed that ethnic minorities will benefit equally from \nthe project, and there will be no negative impact on indigenous peoples from the project. \n \n37. \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n \n38. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \n\nAn ESMS was established for the FIC, inclusive of subprojects classified category B and \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nHPG  has  relatively  weak  lead  and \ncoordination role. \nPMO  and  PIU  staff  lack  experience \nimplementing  ADB-financed  projects, \nespecially  in  financial  management \nand procurement. \nPMOs  and  PIUs  experience  frequent \nturnover of trained staff. \nPMOs  and \nfinancial  intermediaries \nlack  experience  in  SME  financing, \n\nMitigation Measures \nHDRC and HFD have committed to coordinate the project, along with four \nPMOs and with support from project implementation consultants. \nHPG  and  implementing  agencies  have  committed  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for procurement and  financial management.
