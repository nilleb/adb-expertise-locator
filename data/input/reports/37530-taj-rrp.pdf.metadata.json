The summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) is in \nAssessment  Supplementary Appendix J. \n   \nProject Description  The Project takes a holistic and coordinated approach to rural \ndevelopment  to  address  problems  and  constraints,  enhance \nopportunities, and integrate agriculture more effectively into the \nrural economy. The Project will focus on five contiguous raions \n(districts)\u2014Faizabad,  Rogun,  Rudaki,  Vahdat,  and  Varzob\u2014\nlocated around the capital, Dushanbe. \n \nThe Project will (i) address land use security; (ii) develop policies \nand strategy for more effective pasture land management and \ncapacity  development;  (iii)  improve  the  administration  and \ninstitutional aspects of business development; (iv) address the \ncapacity and technical aspects of degradation of arable, pasture, \nand forest lands; (v) establish independent agriculture and rural \nbusiness  advisory  services;  (vi)  establish  an  effective  market \ninformation  system;  (vii)  provide  microcredit;  and  (viii)  improve \nrural infrastructure in communities and raions. \n   \nRationale  While  agriculture  is  contributing  to  the  economy,  it  is \nunderperforming  and  therefore  not  contributing  significantly  to \nrural development and overall poverty reduction in rural areas. As \nfarmers emerge from a primarily subsistence-based agriculture, in \nthe transition to a market-oriented economy, agriculture still has a \nfundamental  role  in  fostering  rural  economic  growth  and  in \ndiversifying and developing the rural nonfarm economy. Inclusive \nrural  development  requires  high  overall  economic  growth; \neffective land reform; adequate support services; the development \nof  economic  and  social  infrastructure;  efficient  and  effective \ninstitutions;  access  to  rural  financial  services;  a  dynamic \nagriculture sector, including attention to new technology, research, \nand the conservation of natural resources; and the development \nof rural nonfarm enterprises.  \n   \nAt present, the key constraints to rural development in Tajikistan \nare: the limited freedom to farm and conduct business; the limited \navailability of support services; poor infrastructure; severe land \ndegradation; and weak institutions. Such weaknesses need to be \naddressed, not independently of one another, but in an integrated, ", "iv   \ncoordinated,  and  sustainable  manner.  In  addition,  there  are \npersistent  gender-based  discriminatory  practices,  which  affect \nwomen\u2019s equal access to resources, services, and opportunities. \nThe Project will address all aspects of agriculture, from land use \nsecurity,  input  supply,  agro-processing,  and  marketing  to \nenterprise  and  capacity  development,  to  bring  farmers  out  of \nsubsistence  production  to  commercial  farming,  and  develop \nrelated farm and nonfarm enterprises. It will do all this with a \ngender  and  development  focus  and  within  an  environmentally \nsustainable management framework. \n \nThe  proposed  area-focused  approach  will  enable  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  to \nstrengthen and coordinate the development activities in the five \nraions  to  enhance  the  development  effectiveness  of  the \nassistance. The Project is expected to be supported with grant \nassistance  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility,  under  the \nCentral Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management. \n \nThe grant component of the Project will develop awareness of \nland and business rights; develop a modern curriculum for pasture \nland management and train associated staff; develop the capacity \nof  raions  to  plan  and  maintain  infrastructure;  and  procure \nconsultants and equipment for project management. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will increase the farm and nonfarm incomes of rural \nhouseholds. As a result of the Project, farms and rural enterprises \nin Faizabod, Rudaki, Rogun, Vahdat, and Varzob are expected to \nbecome more productive and profitable within an environmentally \nsustainable management framework. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $23.3 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.3 million. ADB will finance $17.1 \nmillion  equivalent\u2014$8.8  million  equivalent  from  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  sources  and  $8.3  million  with  an \nADF IX grant. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) will finance \n$3.5 million equivalent, the Government, $1.65 million equivalent, \nand beneficiaries, $1.05 million equivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 5.92 million ($8.8 \nmillion) from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources will be provided. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan interest rate of 1% yearly during the grace period and 1.5% \nyearly thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set \nforth in the Financing Agreement. The loan will meet the costs of \nthe  infrastructure  development,  microfinance,  and  office  and \nequipment requirements. The ADF IX grant of $8.3 million will \nfinance  international  and  national  consultants,  agricultural  and \nrural business advisory staff and services, equipment, vehicles, \ntraining,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  GEF  grant,  if \napproved, will meet the costs of the implementation of the pasture \nland  sector  assessment  recommendations,  the  rehabilitation  of \ndegraded  lands,  consulting  services,  and  equipment.  The ", "  v\nGovernment will finance taxes and duties, counterpart staff, and \nthe  services  of  the  course  coordinator  for  the  pasture  land \ncurricula development and teacher training. The beneficiaries will \nfinance their contribution for the community infrastructure and part \nof their credit requirements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan funds will be provided by the Government to the raions \nTerms  as a grant, except for a $4.0 million equivalent credit line to be \nmade available to borrowers by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nthrough  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs).  MOF  will  onlend  the \nfunds in somoni or Dollars. Somoni loans will be at 75% of the \nNational Bank of Tajikistan (NBKR) interbank interest rate. Dollar \nloans will be at floating rate based on the 6-month LIBOR for \nDollars. The MFIs will bear the foreign exchange risk and will \nrelend  to  subborrowers  under  separate  loan  agreements \nacceptable to ADB. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC) will be created, the Ministry of \nArrangements  Agriculture (MOA) will serve as the Executing Agency (EA) and \nthe  State  Committee  on  Land  Management  (SCLM)  as  the \nImplementing Agency (IA), and a project management unit (PMU). \nVarious  activities  of  the  Project  will  be  contracted  out  to \nnongovernment organizations and other local service providers. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture  \n   \nProcurement  Goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as \namended from time to time).  \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  2,260  person-months  of  consulting \nservices, to be provided by international (184 person-months) and \nnational consultants (2,076 person-months). The consultants will \nbe selected under separate consulting-firm contracts for: pasture \nland sector assessment and implementation; the development of \ncurricula  and  capacity  in  pasture  land  management  at  an \neducational  institution;  agriculture  and  rural  business  advisory \nservices; the establishment of a market information system; and \nproject management. The consultants will be recruited according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as \namended from time to time). The selection will be based on full \ntechnical proposals and quality for the first two contracts, and on \nquality and cost for the other three contracts.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Without the Project, there will continue to be low incomes and \nBeneficiaries  high rates of rural poverty because of very low crop and livestock \nyields and an environment that is not conducive to commercial \nfarming,  agribusiness,  and  rural  enterprises.  The  Project  will ", "vi   \naddress the constraints on increasing rural incomes by improving \ncrop  and  livestock  yields,  pasture  land  management,  and \nopportunities  for  commercial  farming,  agribusiness,  and  rural \nenterprises. \n \nImproved land use security for about 10,000 farmers, through the \nfacilitation of the ongoing farm restructuring and land registration \nprocess in collaboration with other development partners working \non land reform issues, will encourage private sector growth in the \nagriculture and agribusiness sectors. \n \nSecure  land  use  rights,  together  with  agricultural  extension \nservices,  credit,  and  improved  input  supply,  are  expected  to \nimprove crop productivity significantly. The productivity increases \nare  further  expected  to  increase  per  capita  income  from  an \naverage of TJS200 ($60) to TJS580 ($170) for rainfed crop farms \nand to TJS804 ($237) for irrigated farms. \n \nSecure land use and proper pasture land management, together \nwith  the  necessary  support  services,  can  realistically  increase \nannual milk production by at least 50%; the total number of calves \nreared  by  100%;  lambing  percentages  by  100%;  and  kidding \npercentages to 150%. These improvements will allow the 35,000 \nor so farm families that currently have livestock in the project area \nto increase their incomes and assets significantly.  \n \nRural business development will generate significant benefits by \nsupporting  profitable  agricultural  processing  and  other  rural \nenterprises.  The  rural  infrastructure,  prioritized  by  the  local \ncommunities,  will  remove  current  physical  infrastructure \nconstraints. Indicative models of rural water supply and irrigation \nsubprojects show benefits in excess of the costs involved. \n \nThe Project-wide economic analysis, excluding rural infrastructure \ncomponent, shows the Project generating an economic rate of \nreturn of 18%.  The sensitivity analysis indicates stable rates of \nreturn. \n \nThe  Project  will  bring  social  benefits,  particularly  for  poorer \nbeneficiaries, through improvements in land use security, the rural \nbusiness  environment,  access  to  pastures,  and  livelihood \nactivities. \n \nNo significant negative environmental impact is likely. The Project \nis likely to have a significant positive impact on soil and water \nresources,  grassland  productivity,  watershed  condition, \nagricultural development, institutional development, public health, \nand social capital. To support effective project implementation, a \nresettlement framework, a participation plan, a gender action plan, \nand specific actions for ethnic minorities have been prepared. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  While the expected benefits are promising, there are some risks \nattached to the Project. The success of market-oriented private ", "  vii\nfarming and agribusiness depends heavily on secure land use \nrights for farmers and an enabling business environment. The \nProject  will  attempt  to  reduce  these  risks  by  engaging  in \ncontinuous  dialogue  with  higher  levels  of  government  and \nproviding  the  necessary  training  and  capacity  development  to \nfarmers  and  local  government  officials,  to  facilitate  the  reform \nprocess. \n \nThe  Project  is  a  combination  of  investments,  policy  reforms, \ncapacity  development,  and  dissemination  of  technical  and \nbusiness-related  knowledge.  The  knowledge  and  capacity \ndevelopment components, generally, have much higher multiplier \nimpact,  but  the  benefits  are  long-term  and  mostly  intangible. \nThere  is  a  risk  that  investment  components,  particularly \ninfrastructure components, may assume a prominent role in the \nProject  and  take  resources  away  from  the  policy,  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  knowledge  components.  The  Project  will \naddress this risk by setting a cap on the infrastructure component. \n \nThe development partner community has noted corruption, fraud, \nand abuse of funds in previous and current projects. ADB will \naddress  these  issues  by  ensuring  proper  accounting  and \nprocurement  staffing  of  the  PMU.  In  addition,  an  independent \naudit of accounts will be conducted by a certified and reputable \nauditing firm to reduce the risk of misuse of ADB funds. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  Capacity  Building  for  Local \nGovernment will improve economic and social development in the \nfive  raions  of  Faizabod,  Rogum,  Rudaki,  Vardat,  and  Varzob. \nCapacity for economic and social planning is expected to improve \nas a result. A grant of $600,000, to be provided by ADB through \nits TA funding program, will finance the services of international \n(12  person-months)  and  national  consultants  (108  person-\nmonths).  MOA  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA,  which  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 36 months, starting in 2007.  \n \n \n \n ", "69o  00'E 73 o 00'E\nUZBEKISTAN\nTAJIKISTAN\nN RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nLocation of Project Areas\nTakeli\n0 50 100 Kanibadam\nBekabad\nKilometers Khujand Isfara\n40o  00'N Spitamen Shurab 40o  00'N\nIstravshan Vorukh KYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nSUGHD\nREGION\nPendzhikent Ayni Dzhirgatal PEOPLE'S   REPUBLIC\nKaraart OF   CHINA\nGarm Lake Karakul\nREGIONS  OF Nurobod Navobod\nREPUBLICAN\nSUBORDINATION\nObigarm\nDUSHANBE Vahdat Darvoz\nUZBEKISTAN Rogun\nFaisabod Murgab\nTursunzoda Nurek Nivan Lake Sarez\nGORNO-BADAKHSHAN\nAUTONOMOUS  REGION\nDangara\nSarband Kulyab\nKurgan-Tyube\nKHATLON\nREGION Khorog\nKhamadoni\nDzhilikul\nPyandzh\n37o  00'N Shakhrituz 37o  00'N\nNizhniy Pyandzh\nAyvadzh\nIshkashim\nProject District River\nA F G H A N I S T A N National Capital District Boundary\nRegional Capital Regional Boundary\nCity/Town Autonomous Regional Boundary\nMain Road International Boundary\nRailway Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n6\n-3\n1\n4\n9 H 69o  00'E 73 o 00'E\nR\n ", " \nI.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  At  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved a TA for the preparation of the Rural Development Project (the Project).1 The TA was \ncarried out from October 2005 to July 2006. This report is based on the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  feasibility  study,  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with \ngovernment officials, other development partners, civil society, and beneficiaries. The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis2 \n \n3.  Tajikistan is a small, mountainous, landlocked country, whose geographic location and \nhistory present formidable barriers to sustainable growth and development. Of the total area of \n14.3 million hectares (ha), 30% is agricultural land, comprising pasture land (82%), arable land \n(16%),  and  perennial  crops  (2%).  The  total  irrigated  area  of  about  732,000  ha  serves \n504,000 ha of arable land, 122,600 ha of household plots, 79,500 ha of orchards and vineyards, \nand 25,900 ha for other uses. The main irrigated crops are cotton, grains (wheat and corn), \nfruits, and vegetables. About 46% of the total irrigated land is served by pumped systems. \n \n4.  Tajikistan has a narrow economic base, with agriculture providing the major source of \nlivelihood for more than 64% of the population. Agriculture is particularly important for the \neconomy, contributing about 24% of gross domestic product (GDP),3 66% of employment, 26% \nof exports, and 39% of tax revenue. Rural poverty incidence declined from 83% in 1999 to 64% \nin 2003.4  \n \n5.  Crop production, which accounts for 74% of agricultural output, is dominated by cotton. \nCrop yields have increased substantially since 1998, although they remain extremely low by \nregional  and  international  standards.  Crop  production  has  grown  significantly  faster  than \nlivestock  production,  accounting  for  80%  of  sector  growth  from  1999  to  2003.  Livestock \nownership has shifted to households, which own about 90% of all livestock but control about \n10% of the cultivated area for fodder and less than 1% of pastures. Meat and milk production is \nlow, largely because of low fertility and poor nutrition. Access to pastures is limited and animals \ngraze near settlements, causing overgrazing and environmental damage. More than 70% of \nhorticultural output (about 1.0 million tons of fruit and vegetables) is produced on household \nplots. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for Preparing the Rural Development Project. \nManila. \n2  See Appendix 2 for further analysis of the sector. \n3  Aluminum, cotton, fruits, and vegetables constitute 40% of GDP, 70% of exports, and 10% of fiscal revenue (IMF \n2005. IMF Executive Board Conclusions Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Tajikistan). \n4 Despite substantial progress, Tajikistan remains deeply poor: official GDP in 2004 was $311 per capita.  The most \nvulnerable people affected are female-headed households, children, the disabled, and those living in remote or \ndisaster-prone areas. ", "2   \n6.  Land is managed as large state and collective farms,5 collective dekhan farms, private \ndekhan farms, and household plots. The average size of household plots is 0.2 ha, dekhan \nfarms  (including  collective  dekhan  farms)  21  ha,  and  state  and  collective  farms  213  ha. \nHowever, household plots contributed 51%, dekhan farms 37%, and state and collective farms \n12% to agricultural growth from 1999 to 2003.   \n \n7.  Agricultural processing of crops and livestock remains limited. Processing equipment is \noutdated, facilities are large and have overcapacity, and there is an increasing trend toward \nsmaller-scale processing. Livestock processing plants have been privatized but operate at a \nfraction of their installed capacity, often in unsanitary conditions, and with obsolete equipment. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  While agriculture has contributed significantly to economic growth and poverty reduction \nsince 1997, it is still underperforming, and has considerable potential to contribute further to \neconomic  growth,  rural  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  exports.  Tajikistan  is  still \nundergoing transition to a market-oriented economy, and as farmers emerge from a primarily \nsubsistence-based farming agriculture still has a fundamental role in fostering rural economic \ngrowth  and  in  diversifying  and  developing  the  rural  nonfarm  economy.  A  recent  paper6 \nsummarized the major drivers of inclusive rural development as follows: high overall economic \ngrowth; effective land reform; adequate support services; the development of economic and \nsocial infrastructure; efficient and effective institutions; access to rural financial services; a \ndynamic  agriculture  sector,  including  attention  to  new  technology,  research,  and  the \nconservation of natural resources; and the development of rural nonfarm enterprises.    \n \n9.  The key constraints on rural development in Tajikistan are: the limited freedom to farm \nand conduct business; severe land degradation; the limited availability of support services; poor \ninfrastructure; and weak institutions. \n \n10.  Farmers and business entrepreneurs have limited freedom because of the restrictive \nenabling environment, largely at the raion (district) level. Most people have not been adequately \ninformed of their land use rights. Some are dissatisfied with the allocation and demarcation of \nland parcels: at present the local raion authorities can take and reallocate land if its use is \ndeemed  improper  or  irrational.  Similarly,  rural  businesses  must  endure  the  unpredictable \nbehavior  of  local  officials,  primarily  caused  by  differing  interpretations  of  legislation  and \nregulations, and the officials\u2019 lack of knowledge. This environment creates a high degree of \ninsecurity among the people with respect to land use and business rights and discourages them \nfrom investing in land, farming, or developing commercial business. A more favorable farm and \nbusiness environment is essential for land use security, investments in land and farming, and \ninvestments in small and medium enterprises that will deliver input supplies, rural services, \nstorage,  processing,  equipment  dealerships,  financial  services,  and  other  activities  in  an \nemerging market economy. \n \n11.  Extensive land degradation is evident. Irrigation-related land degradation, in particular \nsecondary salinity, waterlogging, and soil erosion, has left about 90,000 ha in poor condition. \nSoil erosion in rainfed farmlands stems largely from the cultivation of wheat on sloping pastures. \nIn addition, overgrazing near settlements, the abandonment of pastures at higher elevations, \nand the unmanaged collection of fuelwood have seriously degraded pasture and forest land. \nSome land management practices, including an absence of soil conservation measures and \n                                                 \n5  These farms are gradually being restructured into cooperative and private dekhan farms.  \n6  Fernando, Nimal. 2006. Rural Development: International Experience and Some Lessons for the People\u2019s Republic \nof China. Draft. Manila. ADB. ", "  3\npoor  pasture  management,  reflect  a  lack  of  knowledge,  as  many  farmers  have  limited \nagricultural training and experience.  \n \n12.  Farmers and rural businesses are disempowered by the lack of professional agriculture \nand  business  support  services.  Limited  services  are  being  provided  by  a  number  of \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and institutes. Better services must be provided in a \nflexible manner to meet the needs of farmers without generating the high overhead costs \nassociated with formal institutional arrangements, and without requiring an increase in recurrent \ngovernment expenditure.  \n \n13.  The limited availability of and access to micro and rural finance severely constrains \nagriculture and rural business development. While working capital is provided by commercial \nbanks and microfinance institutions (MFIs), investment finance is generally not available. The \nagricultural non-cotton lending of commercial banks was TJS91 million ($26.9 million) at the end \nof 2005\u2014about 7% of their lending portfolio. The banks provided agricultural loans ranging from \n$2,400 to $114,000, for an average loan size of about $10,000. Demand for microcredit is high \nand doubling about every 2 years. Microcredit loans in 2005 totaled TJS296 million ($87.5 \nmillion) and had an average size of TJS5,380 ($1,590).  \n \n14.  Market information, which farmers and business entrepreneurs need to make decisions, \nis not timely, often irregular, and not available to a wide audience. There is a need for a network \nthat will collect, analyze, and disseminate market information in a form that can be used by \nadvisers, farmers, and entrepreneurs. \n \n15.  Economic infrastructure is generally in a state of disrepair. Roads and bridges must be \nrehabilitated to provide better and more reliable access to markets and services, irrigation \nsystems  need  major  repair,  drinking  water  is  often  inaccessible,  and  electricity  supply  is \nconstantly disrupted, particularly in winter. Planning and maintenance capacity in raions and \njamoats (groups of villages) is very weak, as reflected in the absence of subsector-specific \ndevelopment and maintenance plans and associated funding. \n  \n16.  National  and  local  institutions  are  weak.  All  central  government  institutions  are \nhampered by the lack of financial resources: their budgets are insufficient to cover much more \nthan  salaries.  Raions  and  jamoats  have  similar  difficulties.  Skills  in  planning  are  lacking, \nparticularly where interrelationships between different parts of the economy are involved,. There \nis no clear accountability for performance, and controls on performance depend on the way the \nindividual  raion  governors  perceive  the  results.  The  budgeting  process  does  not  allow  for \nlonger-term financial planning. \n \n17.  Despite government policies aimed at increasing the involvement of the people in local \ngovernment planning and management, central and local government is still mostly top-down. In \naddition, the weak enabling environment limits the capacity of the private sector to provide \nessential support services to agriculture and rural businesses. \n \n18.  With widows having increased in number following the civil war, and males migrating to \nRussia and other countries for permanent or seasonal employment, households headed by \nwomen are increasing and women in Tajikistan are taking on more livelihood responsibilities. \nBut the employment and income-earning opportunities of women are meager. Besides having to \nearn an income and provide for the household, they must care for their children. In agriculture, \nwomen look after household plots, trade some produce, raise and trade livestock, and work as \nlaborers on collective dekhan farms, where they are paid less than half of what the male \nworkers  receive.  There  are  also  gender  differences  in  access  to  land,  particularly  in  the \nownership of private dekhan farms, and education. \n ", "4   \n19.  The national and rural development strategies of the Government are guided by: (i) the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  for  Tajikistan,  1999\u20132015;  (ii)  the  Medium-Term  Poverty \nReduction Strategy, 2006\u20132008; and (iii) the National Development Strategy for 2006\u20132015. \nThe specific strategy for the development of the agricultural sector is the draft Food Security \nand Agro-Industrial Complex Development Strategy, 2006\u20132015.  \n \n20.  The Food Security and Agro-Industrial Complex Development Strategy of April 2006 \nidentifies the following problems: (i) unclear roles of government and the private sector in \nagricultural development; (ii) insecure land use rights and a lack of freedom in production and \nmarketing  decisions;  (iii)  inconsistent  local  interpretations  of  land  rights  and  limits  on \nentrepreneurial decision making; (iv) limited access to credit; (v) lack of agricultural machinery; \n(vi)  underdeveloped  agriculture  infrastructure  and  markets;  (vii)  deteriorating  irrigation  and \ndrainage systems; (viii) low farm labor productivity; (ix) poor state regulation and sector support, \noften due to administrative interference; (x) a shift from high-value commercial crops to less \nvaluable grains and a significant reduction in fodder crops; (xi) deteriorating quality of livestock \nherds; and (xii) increasing outbreaks of animal diseases. The Strategy proposes the following \nkey  measures:  (i)  improving  land  legislation  and  ownership;  (ii)  clarifying  the  role  of  local \nauthorities in land reform; (iii) giving farmers greater freedom of choice; (iv) reducing cotton debt \nin the medium term by improving access to capital and increasing the significance of Tajik \ncotton on the world market;7 (v) increasing the rate of reform in the sector by introducing further \ninstitutional reform and reducing interference in production decisions at the local level; and \n(vi) improving productivity by rehabilitating irrigation and drainage systems, encouraging the use \nof  improved  farming  techniques,  and  increasing  marketing  awareness.  However,  limited \ninstitutional capacity and lack of funding make it difficult to implement these measures and to \nprogress toward the stated objectives.  \n \n21.  Development assistance in agriculture and rural development is generally increasing, \nparticularly from international donors and NGOs. The number of agencies and the scope of their \nactivities in Tajikistan have expanded in recent years.8 The main agencies are the World Bank, \nthe  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  the \nEuropean Union, the Aga Khan Foundation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations,  and  bilateral  agencies:  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID), the Government of Germany, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation \n(SDC), the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, the Swedish \nInternational Development Agency, and NGOs. NGOs are moving away from humanitarian to \ndevelopment assistance in agriculture, microcredit, social services, and other related areas in \nrural  development.  The  combined  efforts  of  these  agencies  are  helping  the  Government \naddress the challenges discussed above. There is increasing cooperation and cofinancing of \ndevelopment activities. See Appendix 3 for further information about external assistance. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s assistance to agriculture, natural resources, and rural development has focused \non emergency assistance; rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation, especially in cotton-growing \nareas; water supply; cotton debt assessment; and related institutional developments. ADB\u2019s \ncurrent country strategy emphasizes rural development as a key priority in creating a better \nenvironment for more inclusive growth; increased productivity and profitability in the rural sector; \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nTajikistan for the Sustainable Cotton Subsector Project. Manila \n8  The number of development agencies vary slightly depending on the source of the statistics. The UNDP lists 11 UN \norganizations, 5 international financial institutions, 13 international organizations, and 27 international NGOs \nregistered in the country, as well as some embassies that are active in development. The Government\u2019s Aid \nCoordination Unit states that in 2005 there were 63 development partners in the country, including 39 working in \ngovernment administration and 30 in agriculture and irrigation. According to the Unit, there are 94 ongoing projects \nin the agriculture sector throughout Tajikistan, and a further 81 are ongoing, although past their scheduled \ncompletion date.  ", "  5\ninstitution building to strengthen policy implementation and encourage private sector activities; \nand improvements in infrastructure (irrigation and transport).  \n \n23.  Lessons. According to the 2006 Annual Evaluation Review,9 the project success in \ncategory A countries from 1990 to 1997 was 74%, better than in category B countries and the \naverage performance overall. Among the countries that did well were the transition economies. \nOn the other hand, agriculture projects had the worst outcomes for projects financed out of the \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)\u2014only  47%  were  rated  successful  overall\u2014although  the \nsuccess rate for irrigation and rural development projects exceeded 50%. The main problems \nwere: (i) inadequate project design, including inadequate understanding of the problems and \nopportunities  from  the  beneficiaries\u2019  perspective;  (ii)  overly  complex  projects;  (iii)  weak \ninstitutions; (iv) limited budgets; (v) adverse impact of external factors; and (vi) weak project \nadministration. On the other hand, the following critical factors contributed to the success of \nADB projects: (i) quality of project at entry, (ii) strong country ownership, (iii) flexible design and \na participatory approach, (iv) ability to learn from previous experience and incorporate lessons \ninto the project design, (v) good supervision of project implementation, and (vi) strong project \nmanagement units and related oversight institutions to ensure good performance and timely \ndelivery from the contractors.     \n \n24.  ADB and other development projects in Tajikistan have shown that effective project \nimplementation  requires  the  following:  (i)  capable  local  management  staff;  (ii)  international \nconsulting assistance to provide international good practice in technical fields, and train local \nmanagement staff in personnel management, technical aspects, procurement, financial control, \nand monitoring and evaluation; (iii) early establishment of a transparent financial management \nsystem; (iv) flexibility in implementation, particularly when project design is undertaken in rapidly \nchanging  circumstances  and  with  limited  reliable  information;  (v)  close  supervision  and \nmonitoring of project management to ensure that project implementation capabilities are aligned \nwith  the  objectives,  to  minimize  government  interference  in  the  recruitment  of  national \nconsultants and other support staff, and to ensure the selection of professionally capable staff; \n(vi) recognition that the central and local government administrations have very weak capacity \nand are under-resourced, and can therefore provide only limited support; and (vii) recognition of \nthe vulnerability of project implementation to top-down approaches, because the need to involve \nall  stakeholders,  particularly  beneficiaries,  in  implementation  is  understood  inadequately  or \nresisted. All these identified lessons have been addressed to varying degrees in the Project\u2019s \ndesign. Implementation must be closely monitored, and the Project must retain the flexibility to \naddress any of the above aspects if they arise. \n \n25.  The  Project  has  benefited  from  ongoing  ADB  regional  assistance  supporting \ndevelopment of the Central Asian Countries Initiative on Land Management (CACILM), a multi-\ncountry program extending over ten years and involving all five former Soviet Central Asian \ncountries to systematically identify and address the most important land degradation problems \nin the region. CACILM is built upon a framework of National Programming Frameworks for \nSustainable Land Management (NPFs) developed for each of the five countries, and the Project \nis  firmly  included  in  the  Tajikistan  NPF  as  high  priority  under  the  country\u2019s  strategy  for \naddressing land degradation. The NPF identifies the need for strengthening of policies and \ninstitutions as well as the complementary on-the-ground investments required both within the \nframework for generating financing to support the identified priorities, and ADB is leading a \nconsortium of bilateral and multilateral partners to mobilize such funding. In particular, the \nGlobal Environmental Facility (GEF) has endorsed a first phase of projects amounting to more \nthan $150 million in investments, with GEF to provide $20 million in grant financing. The project \nis included in this framework, and it is expected to receive $2,500,000 in GEF grant cofinancing \nas part of the CACILM program. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006. 2006 Annual Evaluation Review. Manila. ", "6   \n26.  The project design options considered were as follows: (i) a community development \napproach focusing on essential infrastructure to support raion and community development; \n(ii) a national approach to addressing one or more of the key constraints identified; and (ii) an \narea-based project to address multiple constraints. The preferred design was the area-based \napproach, which recognizes the interdependencies among the problems and constraints. This \napproach  supports  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  to  rural  development  to  address \nproblems and constraints, enhance opportunities, and integrate agriculture more effectively into \nthe  rural  economy.  It  also  supports  stronger  cooperation  and  coordination  with  national \nagencies, development partners, NGOs, and service providers.  \n \n27.  The Project will address policy reforms by improving land use security, the business \nenvironment, and policy directions in pasture management; capacity development in agriculture \nextension  and  business  advisory  services,  and  among  raion  and  jamoat  governments, \ncommunities, and farmers; and investments to improve raion community infrastructure, reverse \nthe degradation of arable and pasture land, and set up agriculture extension and business \nadvisory services and market information centers.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT10 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n28.  The Project is expected to increase the farm and nonfarm incomes of rural households. \nIt will also increase the productivity of farms and rural enterprises within an environmentally \nsustainable management framework. The Project will support individual and cooperative dekhan \nfarms, households, and private rural entrepreneurs.  \n \nB.  Project Area \n \n29.  The project area had to meet specific criteria:11  it had to comprise areas that (i) did not \ngrow cotton or had small (less than 10%) and declining cotton-growing areas, and were focused \non  fruit  and  vegetable  production  and  livestock  raising;  (ii)  were  contiguous,  to  provide \nopportunities for economies of scale and strategic integrated development; (iii) had year-round \nroad access; and (iv) had no similar major projects planned or already under way. From a list of \n28 raions, five were selected: Faizabod, Rudaki, Rogun, Vahdat, and Varzob.  \n \n30.  The project area covers about 8,350 km\u00b2. Temperature and precipitation vary widely, \ngiving rise to diverse agro-climatic conditions in a relatively small area. The rural population of \n552,100 is concentrated in the valleys, for an effective population density of nearly 600 persons \nper square kilometer, resulting in increasing pressure on the environment. The area accounts for \nabout 10% of the country\u2019s official GDP, about 77% of which derives from agriculture. Rural \npoverty is widespread: about 40% of the population is designated as poor. Dependent largely on \nsubsistence agriculture, the people have few  business and employment opportunities, and \nmany seek seasonal work abroad, mainly in Russia. \n \n31.  The project area comprises (i) 55 collective dekhan farms with an average area of 419 \nha, (ii) 6,634 private dekhan farms with an average area of 5 ha, and (iii) 69,600 household \nplots ranging in size from 0.15 to 0.30 ha. Of the collective and individual dekhan farms, mainly \nplanted with wheat and potatoes and other field crops, only about 50% benefit from irrigation. \nHousehold plots are generally irrigated at lower elevations, but are mostly rainfed in higher \nelevations. Household plots are planted with vegetables, fruits, potatoes, and wheat, often \n                                                 \n10  More details on the project scope and implementation arrangements are found in Supplementary Appendix A. \n11 These criteria and the selection of the five raions were agreed on between ADB, the project steering committee \n(PSC), and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) at the start of the project preparatory technical assistance. ", "  7\ndouble- or even triple-cropped on at least part of the land. Yields have been increasing but are \nvery low by international standards. \n \n32.  In addition, rural-urban linkages and farm support services, such as the supply of seed, \ninputs, and access to credit, are rudimentary near Dushanbe and even less adequate in areas \nfarther away from the capital. \n \n33.  Except for Rudaki, all project raions depend on budget subsidies from the national \nGovernment; Faizabod received 85% of its budget from the national Government, Roghun 79%, \nVahdat 43%, and Varzob 72% in 2005. Raion governments do not have enough resources to \nensure adequate functioning of basic infrastructure, and have limited administrative capability \nfor local development.  \n \n34.  NGOs are active in the five project raions: Aga Khan Foundation in Faizobod and \nRoghun, Cooperative for Aid and Relief Everywhere in Vahdat and Varzob, and German Agro \nAction in all five raions.  Rudaki has been largely bypassed by NGOs, although the Food and \nAgriculture Organization and Winrock International are active. NGOs provide a broad range of \ndevelopment assistance ranging from the facilitation of mediation in land reform issues, pasture \nmanagement, farm advisory services, rural business development, and micro credit, to the \nrebuilding of rural infrastructure. ADB is involved in the irrigation sector in Vahdat,12 and the \nconstruction of the main road and rural roads in Faizabod, Rogun, and Vahdat.13 The World \nBank and USAID are working in local governance reform, land reform, and social and economic  \ndevelopment. Further details on the project area are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n35.  The Project has five components\u2014four technical and one project management\u2014with \nrelated outputs and activities: policy and institutional development and reform; sustainable land \nmanagement  (pasture,  arable,  and  forest);  agriculture  and  rural  business  support;  rural \ninfrastructure development; and project management. \n \n1.  Policy and Institutional Development and Reform \n \n36.  This component is focused on improving land use security, policies and instructions for \npasture  land  management,  and  the  administration  and  institutional  aspects  of  business \ndevelopment. This component has three outputs. \n \n37.  To improve the security of land use rights for farmers (output 1.1), the Project will \nimplement programs to make raion officials more aware of their powers under the Land Code \nand related legislation, and farmers more aware of their rights and of the available support \nservices for arbitration and legal redress. Recent and current practices in land registration in the \nproject area will be surveyed to identify the impediments to effective land registration and good \npractices  in  dealing  with  land  registration  disputes,  and  to  discuss  and  agree  with  raion \nadministrations on good practices to be implemented under the Project. The results of this \nreview  will  inform  the  content  of  the  legal  literacy  and  legal  aid  initiatives  to  make  local \ncommunities in the raions and jamoats more familiar with the rules, processes, and institutions \nrelated to the Land Code, particularly for land registration. After that, and in association with \nrelevant organizations and development partners, the Project will facilitate the completion of the \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2004.

This performance will influence the availability and allocation \nof funds for infrastructure investment under the rural infrastructure development component. \n   \n38.  Pasture  land  management  improvement  activities  (output  1.2)  will  start  with  an \ninternational conference to examine current practice in Tajikistan, identify good international \npractice relevant to Tajikistan, and raise awareness of management problems. This conference \nwill be followed by an assessment and the preparation of a road map for policy, strategy, \nlegislation, capacity development, and investments in pasture land management. An outline of \nthe sector assessment is shown in Supplementary Appendix C. Finally, the Project will support \nthe completion of a national vision, policy, strategy, and investment program for sustainable \npasture land management, and draft legislation and regulations to facilitate the implementation \nof the recommendations under component 2. National and regional workshops will be held to \nexplain the results and the implications for raion administration of the concept and process of \nimproved use of pasture land. \n \n39.  To address the varied business environment among the raions  (output 1.3), the Project, \nthrough the project management unit (PMU), will conduct an economic study to demonstrate the \ncosts of administrative interference in farm and business decision making in terms of reduced \ninvestment and lost productivity; train raion and jamoat staff in the equitable and transparent \ninterpretation of business legislation and help them identify, post, and regularly update a list of \nfines and penalties linked to specific violations of laws and regulations; pilot-test a simplified \nregistration procedure, within the existing legislative framework, for businesses and dekhan \nfarms; and monitor changes in the business environment and performance of raion and jamoat \nauthorities. \n \n2.  Component 2: Sustainable Land Management (Pasture, Arable, and Forest) \n \n40.  This component comprises a set of linked activities that address the need for better land \nmanagement  by  improving  integrated  pasture  land  and  livestock  techniques,  enhancing \ncapacity, and reversing land degradation. This component has three outputs.  \n \n41.  The prioritized recommendations from the pasture land and livestock management study \nand sector assessment (output 1.2) will be pilot-tested in the project area. New techniques and \napproaches  to  grassland  and  livestock  planning  and  management  (output  2.1)  will  be \ndemonstrated  to  improve  pasture  land  conditions  within  an  economically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable framework. The pilot areas will serve as trial and demonstration \nareas preparatory to replication throughout the Project. These activities will be coordinated with \nthe capacity development activities in output 2.2 and the advisory services in output 3.1.  \n \n42.  The Project will establish pilot sites with different farming systems to demonstrate the \napplication of the new pasture land and livestock planning and management techniques and \nrehabilitate and revegetate selected pasture lands. Monitoring protocols will be designed for \nfarm-level planning and management of livestock production systems in pasture lands, including \nthe impact on social organization. Local specialists will be trained and the monitoring systems \nimplemented by concerned organizations, with repeated surveys of indicators at appropriate \nseasons and points in the production cycle. Finally, the methodology will be adopted and \nexpanded within the project area.  \n \n43.  The introduction of new concepts of pasture land and livestock management based on \nholistic  thinking  about  economic  goals,  the  social  context,  environmental  conditions  and \nprocesses, animal behavior, and resource constraints requires the establishment of a new cadre ", "  9\nof skilled personnel and institutional capacity to provide advice and further training to meet the \nneeds of the country (output 2.2). To address current capacity limitations, the Project will: \nthrough an internationally accredited institution, develop and implement curricula in pasture land \nmanagement and train teaching staff at a selected university or vocational institution; identify \nand support an appropriate organization to establish a network of  cooperating institutions that \nwill disseminate good practice in sustainable land management; use established demonstration \nsites (output 2.1) to give practical training to students, demonstrate successful practices, and \nincrease outreach, including links with extension services (output 3.1); and provide short-term \n(up to 3 months) university-level training overseas for a number of faculty members in the \nselected educational institution.   \n \n44.  The activities to rehabilitate degraded land will focus on arable, cultivated marginal land, \nand forestry-pasture lands (output 2.3), as pasture land is addressed under outputs 2.1 and 2.2. \nSpecifically, the Project will assess the degradation of these lands at the raion level to identify \nthe  causes,  status,  and  impact  of  land  degradation  to  improve  decision  making  for  land \nmanagement. This activity will be carried out in coordination with the Central Asian Countries \nInitiative  for  Land  Management  (CACILM),  which  will  be  conducting  a  land  degradation \nassessment  (scheduled  for  2007)  to  gather  baseline  information  for  a  sustainable  land \nmanagement  information  system.  The  Project  will  pilot-test  sustainable  land  management \npractices  to  develop  and  promote  improved  land  reclamation  and  innovative  onfarm \ntechnologies;  demonstrate  enhanced  agronomic  practices  for  efficient  and  equitable  water \nmanagement;  revegetate  or  rehabilitate  selected  areas;  and  undertake  community  forestry \nactivities including selection and implementation of demonstration sites, establishment of user \ngroups, training, and workshops. \n \n3.  Agriculture and Rural Business Support \n \n45.  This component focuses on establishing farm and rural business advisory services and a \nmarket information system. This component has two outputs. \n \n46.  To support the establishment and sustainability of the provision of agriculture and rural \nbusiness advisory services (output 3.1), the Project will assess the demand for agricultural and \nrural business advisory services to determine the number and size of advisory centers to be \nestablished and the training and advice that the centers should deliver to meet the needs of \nfarmers and enterprises. Advisory centers will be established through contracting NGOs, which \nwill  be  required  to  work  closely  with  other  organizations,  such  as  relevant  research  and \neducational  establishments,  development  partners,  and  other  national  and  international \nagencies. Each advisory center will be staffed with specialists; their number and type will \ndepend on the need in each raion, up to a maximum of eight management and technical \nspecialists and adequate support staff in each center. The centers will concentrate on providing \ntechnical and economic advice specific to the agricultural and horticultural onfarm activities and \nagriculture value chain services in the project area and in accordance with the needs and \nresources available to farmers, households, and businesses. Training courses for groups of \nfarmers will be provided on crop and livestock production techniques; pasture and grassland \nmanagement  and  forage  conservation  (in  association  with  activities  under  component  2); \nintegrated  pest  management;  animal  health;  crop  harvesting  and  storage;  sources  and \navailability of farm inputs; and current legislation affecting farm activities. Demonstration plots \nwill show farmers practical techniques to improve farm productivity, profitability, and the quality \nof produce. The agricultural advisers will assist farmers in finding suppliers of physical inputs \nsuch as seed, fertilizer, pesticides, fuel, feedstuffs, and medicines, as well as machinery parts \nand services. Groups of farmers will be formed into informal buying groups to improve access \nto: inputs, markets by working with processors, and post-harvest technology, transport, and \nstorage. Similarly, the business advisers will provide services to farmers and businesses on: \ndiversification opportunities; domestic and export marketing; appropriate processing outlets and ", "10  \ncool chain facilities; business planning; credit applications; the formation and establishment of \ngroups for input supply, production, marketing, machinery, processing etc.; and establishment \nand registration of businesses. The Project will also develop and improve the knowledge and \nskills base of the advisers. This will initially be the responsibility of the contracted NGOs. In \naddition,  the  Project  will  explore  options  for  developing  agriculture  extension  and  farm \nmanagement programs at an appropriate educational institution, similar to the arrangement \nproposed for pasture land management. \n \n47.  To  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  advisory  centers,  the  Project  will  explore \nmechanisms for these centers to be established as public associations at start-up or within 4 \nyears of their establishment. \n \n48.  To address the limited availability and access to micro and rural finance, the Project will \nprovide a $4.0 million credit line through MFIs for onlending to small rural borrowers in the \nProject area for working capital and investments.  \n \n49.  It is expected that up to three MFIs could participate in the Project. For an MFI to \nparticipate, in addition to being a microfinance deposit organization or a microfinance lending \norganization, it will have to: (i) have its accounts audited by an international audit company; (ii) \nadhere to the National Bank of Tajikistan\u2019s (NBT\u2019s) prudential standards; (iii) be prepared to \nonlend funds in all project raions, unless the Government and ADB agree that full coverage by a \nsingle MFI is not  necessary, and provided that all participating MFIs cover all five project raions; \nand (iv) provide a business plan, acceptable to ADB, for their proposed outreach and product \ndevelopment  in  the  project  area,  to  demonstrate  their  ability  to  serve  small  farmers  and \nagribusinesses,  and  update  the  plan  annually.  A  competitive  process  will  be  followed  in \nselecting appropriate MFIs, and due diligence of all potentially qualified and interested MFIs will \nbe undertaken. MFIs will be required to meet the following criteria: (i) be financially sound; \n(ii) have adequate credit and risk management policies, and operating system and procedures; \n(iii) comply with prudential regulations; (iv) have acceptable corporate and financial governance \nand management practices; (v) have sound business objectives and strategy or plan; (vi) have \nautonomy  in  lending  and  pricing  decisions;  (vii)  have  adequate  policies,  systems,  and \nprocedures  for  assessing  and  monitoring  the  impact  of  subprojects;  and  (viii)  have \nenvironmental screening processes acceptable to ADB. The final list of qualified MFIs will be \nselected and agreed on with ADB. \n \n50.  To address the gap in market information, the Project will establish a market information \nunit (MIU) to collect reliable and statistically valid information on prices in markets in the project \narea, Dushanbe, and other major urban areas, the cost of inputs and supply sources, and \nmarket trends, and to provide regular information through various media. The establishment of \nthe MIU will be tendered to agencies active in agricultural information dissemination, to enhance \nthe likelihood of its sustainability. Moreover, the Project will assist the MIU in research on import \nsubstitution and export opportunities and requirements by country or destination. The unit will \nanalyze the information, compile it into a readily usable format, and share the information with \nagriculture and rural business advisory services (output 3.1). The MIU will also assist with the \nidentification of foreign buyers and investors. \n \n4.  Rural Infrastructure Development \n \n51.  This component will strengthen the capacity of raions, jamoats, and communities to plan, \nimplement,  and  maintain  infrastructure,  and  to  support  investments  in  the  small-scale \nconstruction and rehabilitation of local public infrastructure. Eligible investments will include road ", " 11\nand bridge access, rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems, drinking water supplies, \nand small-scale electricity generation and distribution.14 This component has two outputs.  \n \n52.  The limited planning and maintenance capacity of the raions, jamoats, and communities \nwill be improved in several ways (output 4.1). Raion working groups, comprising raion and \njamoat officials and civil society representatives will be established to: identify, prioritize, and \nplan infrastructure subprojects for rehabilitation or construction in raions and communities; work \nin  partnership  with  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  in  agreeing  on  subprojects  for \nfinancing; submit projects to the PMU; oversee the construction activities; and ensure the \neffective operation and maintenance (O&M) of completed subprojects. CBOs will be established \nto identify and prioritize infrastructure needs, agree on cash or in-kind contributions; determine \nappropriate O&M activities and financing; and work in partnership with the raion working group. \nThe  Project  will  assist  both  raions  and  jamoats  in  preparing  broad-based  plans  for  each \nsubsector in which project proposals will be submitted. These plans will provide an overview of \nthe subsector needs, the current state of assets, existing maintenance programs (including past \nfunding), future infrastructure needs, proposed maintenance plans and funding for existing and \nnew  infrastructure,  and  the  process  of  identifying  and  prioritizing  investment  proposals. \nMoreover,  training  in  planning  processes  and  preparation  of  investment  proposals,  and \nassistance in developing linkages between the investment maintenance proposals and available \nfunding, will be provided. Each raion will be provided with adequate equipment (computers, \nprinters, copiers, and associated software and accessories). \n \n53.  The  Project,  through  the  PMU,  will  support  raion  officials  in  ensuring  adequate \nwillingness  and  ability  to  pay  for  the  O&M  of  rehabilitated  or  developed  infrastructure; \nestablishing annual maintenance plans for all infrastructure rehabilitated or developed under the \nProject; ensuring that each community provides the agreed level of financial support (10% of the \ntotal value of labor and materials) or contributions in kind toward maintenance, to remain eligible \nfor  further  works;  establishing  local  maintenance  units  or  user  groups  (e.g.,  water  user \nassociations) where these are the most cost-effective solution to the problem of maintaining \ninfrastructure  in  good  working  condition;  ensuring  that  engineering  drawings,  plans,  and \nspecifications meet the specified standard; assisting with procurement; and supervising civil \nworks to ensure that they comply with specifications (output 4.2). \n \n54.  For any raion or community infrastructure subproject to be accepted for funding, it must  \nbe demonstrated that: (i) the level of potential benefits and the number of beneficiaries have \nbeen assessed; (ii) subprojects have been prioritized in relation to the quantified benefits and \nnumber  of  beneficiaries;  (iii)  communities  have  been  consulted  in  identifying  priority \ninfrastructure; (iv) the subproject proposal identifies clearly the associated O&M costs and \nfunding arrangement required to meet such costs and includes an annual maintenance plan; \n(v) the subproject is technically feasible and economically viable, and represents the most cost-\neffective  alternative;  (vi)  an  environmental  impact  assessment  has  been  conducted  in \naccordance with the initial environmental examination (IEE); (vii) adequate O&M and funding \narrangements have been considered, on the basis of consultations with local communities; and \n(viii) all required governmental approvals have been obtained. \n \n55.  Funding  for  each  infrastructure  subproject  will  be  limited  to  $250,000  for  raion \ninfrastructure  and  $50,000  for  community  infrastructure.  Funding  will  be  provided  in  three \ntranches in the first, third, and fifth years, and will be released to each raion only when the \nperformance targets agreed on by the Government and ADB for component 1 have been met. \n                                                 \n14  Social infrastructure projects, such as schools and health services that fall outside the broad definition of \ninfrastructure supporting the agriculture sector will not be eligible for funding, nor will investments in activities and \nlocations  where  international  funding  agencies  such  as  ADB  have  similar  services  planned  or  under \nimplementation. ", "12  \nThese performance targets will be based on the following indicators: (i) land is allocated through \nan improved, transparent process; (ii) registrations of farmers\u2019 land increase annually; (iii) an \neffective  and  fair  system  for  resolving  land  disputes  is  operational;  (iv)  a  simplified  and \ntransparent registration procedure has been introduced and continues to operate effectively; \nand (v) infrastructure financed from earlier tranches is satisfactorily planned and maintained. \nFifty percent of the funds from each tranche will be distributed equally to each of the five project \nraions, and the remaining 50% will be disbursed on a competitive basis to be assessed by the \nPMU  according  to  the  prioritization  assessment,  the  feasibility  of  the  proposed  subproject \ninvestment, the demonstrated physical and financial capacity to maintain the infrastructure, and \nsatisfactory maintenance of previously funded infrastructure. Funds from each tranche release \nwill be allocated twice yearly on the basis of acceptable proposals received from the project \nraions. Proposals for infrastructure subprojects will be submitted to the raion working group, \nwhich  will  endorse  subprojects  to  the  PMU  for  final  approval.  The  PMU  will  assess  the \nsubproject proposals and submit the prioritized list to the PSC. Any major deviation from the \nPMU recommendations will have to be explained to and approved by ADB. ADB will review the \nprocess of assessing, prioritizing, and approving proposals during regular review missions. \n \n56.  For the community infrastructure subprojects, training in priority setting for jamoats will \nbe  based  on  simplified  techniques  that  are  appropriate  for  the  scale  of  investment  to  be \nconsidered. Participatory decision making at the local level will be emphasized. The PMU will \nwork directly with the raion working groups, jamoats, and CBOs as appropriate to agree on \ninfrastructure priorities and specific plans. The PMU will also ensure that elite capture does not \noccur by working through representatives of local community institutions and that women\u2019s \npriorities are properly reflected in subproject identification and prioritization. \n \n57.  As part of the application process, local communities must commit to meet the O&M \ncosts before subprojects are approved. They will be required to contribute 10% of the total value \nof  labor  and  materials  for  each  subproject.  Labor  inputs  at  current  market  rates  will  be \nconsidered an adequate contribution. If labor inputs are likely to impose an undue burden on \nwomen and girls in the project area, the level of community contribution may be adjusted by the \nPMU. As far as possible, local procurement will apply.  Local institutions and personnel, and \nlabor-intensive approaches, where feasible, will be used to complete the work. \n \n  5.  Project Management \n \n58.  Project  management  will  be  conducted  through  the  PMU  in  the  MOA.  In  addition, \nmanagement support will be sought for selected activities through cofinancing arrangements \nwith other development partners, subcontracting of local institutions or NGOs, or service support \nfrom  agencies  that  specialize  in  the  delivery  of  such  services.  Further  details  of  project \nmanagement are described under Implementation Arrangements (section H).  \n \nD.  ADF IX Grant Component  \n \n59.  Part of the project financing will take the form of a grant. The ADF IX grant will finance \nthe services of international and national consultants, agricultural and rural business advisory \nstaff and services, equipment, vehicles, training, and monitoring and evaluation. The grant \ncomponent will increase awareness of land and business rights, develop modern curricula for \npasture land management and train associated staff, build the capacity of raions to plan and \nmaintain infrastructure, and provide the services of international consultants and equipment for \nproject management. See Appendix 4 for further information. \n ", " 13\nE.  Special Features \n \n60.  The Project represents a shift from previous assistance to Tajikistan in that it adopts a \nmore holistic approach, takes an area focus, shifts assistance away from cotton-growing areas, \ngives emphasis to the development of more effective partnerships, and includes cofinancing. It \nis the first ADB-financed project to be implemented by MOA. \n \n61.  The Project takes a comprehensive, integrated approach to addressing fundamental \nconstraints on the shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture, including land security and \nbusiness environment limitations. It will undertake a nationwide pasture land assessment and \nprepare a road map for policy, strategy, legislation, capacity development, and investment; \nprovide essential agriculture and business support services; rehabilitate essential community \nand district infrastructure; and address the problem of increasing land degradation\u2014in each \ncase, to ensure a more effective and coordinated approach to rural development. \n \n62.  In addition, the Project will build partnerships with ADB\u2019s development partners and \nother organizations. Such partnerships will be enhanced through the contracting out of project \nactivities, such as the management information system and agriculture and rural business \nadvisory services, to qualified service providers including NGOs. Moreover, the agriculture and \nrural advisory centers are expected to be legally registered as independent public associations \neither at start-up or no later than the end of the fourth year of the Project. \n \nF.  Project Investment Plan \n \n63.  The project investment cost is estimated at $23.3 million, including taxes and duties of \n$1.30 million, $1.16 million for physical and price contingencies, and $0.37 million in interest \ncharges  during  implementation.  Cost  estimates  by  project  component  are  summarized  in \nTable 1, while the detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 5 and detailed cost tables in \nSupplementary Appendix D.    \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounts \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n64.  The Government has requested ADB to provide an ADF loan equivalent to $8.8 million \nand an ADF IX grant of $8.3 million to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% yearly during the grace period ", "14  \nand 1.5% yearly after that, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the Financing \nAgreement. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plana \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nADB Loan  8.80  37.80 \nADB Grant  8.30  35.60 \nBeneficiaries  1.05  4.50 \nGEFb  3.50  15.00 \nGovernment  1.65  7.10 \n  Total  23.30  100.00 \nADB=Asian Development Bank, GEF=Global Environmental Facility \na The possibility of UNDP cofinancing and implementing component 4 is being discussed with that UN \nagency. \nb  GEF funding is subject to approval by the CEO of GEF. In the event GEF funding is not forthcoming, \nADB\u2019s share of financing will increase to 87%. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n65.   The proposed ADB loan will finance 37.8% of the total project cost and will meet the \ncosts of the infrastructure development and the microfinance credit line. The proposed ADF IX \ngrant will finance 35.6% of the total project cost and will finance the consulting and advisory \nstaff services, training, surveys and monitoring, vehicles, and office equipment. The proposed \nGEF funds will finance 15% of the project cost, to meet the costs of implementation of the \npasture land sector assessment recommendations, rehabilitation of degraded land, consulting \nservices and equipment. The detailed proposal for GEF is in Supplementary Appendix E. The \nGovernment will finance 7.1% of the project cost in taxes and duties, and the services of the \neducation institution staff who will be involved in pasture land curriculum development, teaching, \nand  capacity  development.  Beneficiary  contributions  for  the  community  infrastructure  and \nanticipated contributions of our funds to investments by subborrowers of the credit line will \nfinance 4.5% of the project cost. The beneficiaries will also contribute to the maintenance of the \ninfrastructure on completion, but these costs have not been estimated. \n \n66.  ADB has typically sought Board approval for the administration of loan or grant funds \nfrom cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place.  In the case of the proposed \ngrant funding from GEF, the full GEF project proposal is being finalized and submitted to GEF \ntogether with this Report. To avoid any Project delay, the Board is requested to approve the \nadministration of the proposed GEF grant, in the amount of $3,500,000, which is expected to be \nobtained subsequent to the date of Board approval.  Approval of the GEF grant will be reported \nto the Board in accordance with standard reporting procedures. If GEF does not approve \nfinancing, the Sustainable Land (Pasture, Arable and Forest Land) Management component will \nbe significantly affected with the support for pasture management field trials, demonstrations, \nand training; and establishment of a pastures management program at a selected university or \nvocational level institution removed from the Project. Nevertheless, the Agriculture and Rural \nBusiness Support Component will provide some extension support to farmers in livestock and \npasture management. Other aspects of the Project including the pasture sector assessment will \nnot be significantly affected. \n \n67.  Disbursements will be based on the percentages in the Financing Agreement. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n68.  Given the complexity of the Project, the uniqueness of its approach in Tajikistan, the low \ncapacity of local institutions, and the changing nature of activities resulting from the ongoing \ntransition  to  a  market-oriented  economy,  a  flexible  approach  to  project  implementation  is ", " 15\nneeded. However, more flexibility will require a more concerted focus on the monitoring and \nsupervision of the Project by both the Government and ADB.  \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n69.  The project management arrangements include a PSC, MOA as Executing Agency (EA), \nthe State Committee for Land Management (SCLM) as Implementing Agency (IA), and a PMU \nin the EA. See Appendix 6 for the organization chart. \n \n70.  The implementation of the Project will be guided by a PSC comprising the MOA (chair), \nand representatives of the office of the President, MOF, SCLM, Ministry of Economy and Trade, \nMinistry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land  Reclamation,  State  Committee  on  Environmental \nProtection and Forestry, Tajikistan Agricultural Academy of Sciences, raion administrations, \nfarmers, private sector representatives, the NGO sector, development partners, ADB, and the \nproject manager. The PSC will (i) guide the overall policy and strategic direction of the Project, \n(ii) review and evaluate project performance, (iii) review the audited project accounts, (iv) select \nthe consultants for the implementation through the tender committee; (v) endorse or reject PMU \nproposals for rural infrastructure improvements under component 4; (vi) facilitate interagency \ncoordination as well as coordination of project activities with activities taking place under other \nprojects financed by development partners in the project raions; (vii) resolve issues affecting \nproject implementation; and (viii) provide guidance as needed. The PSC will meet monthly \nduring the first 4 months of the Project, and every 6 months after that, when the Project is well \nestablished, to review progress. The PMU will serve as the secretariat for the tender committee \nthat will review and evaluate all procurement proposals for consulting services, civil works, and \ngoods. The tender committee will be composed of the MOA (chair), MOF, SCLM, the national \nprocurement agency, the PMU manager, the PMU procurement specialist, representatives of \nthe project raions, and others as deemed necessary by the chair of the tender committee.   \n \n71.  MOA, as the EA, will (i) disburse ADB loan and grant proceeds; (ii) keep accurate and \nduplicate records on withdrawal applications and disbursements under the project accounts; \n(iii) submit to ADB progress and other reports prepared by the PMU; (iv) ensure the timely \nsubmission  of  audited  accounts  of  the  Project  to  ADB;  (v)  coordinate  communication  and \ninteraction between SCLM, the raion administrations, contracted service providers, and ADB; \nand  (vi)  provide  necessary  guidance  as  appropriate.  A  project  director  from  MOA  will  be \nappointed and funded by the Government on a part-time basis. He or she will oversee the \nProject and will report to the minister of agriculture and the PSC on major issues. \n \n72.  The SCLM, as the IA, will be responsible for: (i) policy and institutional arrangements for \npasture  lands  (output  1.2),  (ii)  improvement  of  pasture  land  and  livestock  planning  and \nmanagement skills (output 2.1), (iii) development of capacity for effective land management \n(output 2.2), and (iv) rehabilitation of degraded lands (output 2.3). In relation to the foregoing \nactivities, SCLM will (i) be responsible for direct, day-to-day management, (ii) participate in all \ncommittees for procurement and consulting services, and (iii) prepare quarterly monitoring and \nevaluation reports for submission to the PMU, CACILM, GEF, and ADB. The SCLM will provide \nreports to the PMU. \n \n73.  The  report  on  the  financial  management  assessment  of  MOA  (see  Supplementary \nAppendix F) concluded that the MOA had significant accounting weaknesses (lack of internal \ncontrol  and  audit;  lack  of  external  audit;  limited  number  of  qualified  staff  and  lack  of \naccountability; limited computerization; lack of proper planning, effective operational analysis, \nand rational use of funds; and lack of proper communication with regional units of MOA), and \nwas therefore not equipped to administer project funds directly. Other development partner \nprojects for which the MOA was or is the executing agency were implemented by various \nseparate project management or implementation units. The financial management assessment ", "16  \nreport recommended the establishment of a PMU with representative offices in the project \nraions.  \n \n74.  A PMU will be established to ensure the effective implementation and management of \nthe Project and to ensure the appropriate use of funds to produce the anticipated results under \nthe Project. The PMU will include a project manager, a procurement and consulting services \nspecialist,  suitably  qualified  accounting  and  bookkeeping  staff,  national  and  international \nconsultants, and other staff. During project start-up the PMU staff will work with relevant ADB \nstaff to ensure effective compliance with ADB and government project rules and procedures. \n \n75.  The PMU will (i) ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with its design; \n(ii) ensure effective coordination of all activities and agencies involved; (iii) ensure compliance \nwith  environmental  requirements  and  other  safeguard  measures;  (iv)  maintain  appropriate \naccounts,  including  reports  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursements;  (v)  manage \nprocurement in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines; and (vi) prepare quarterly progress and other \nreports  in  formats  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  At  the  start,  the  PMU  will  have  one  local \nrepresentative each for Rudaki and Vahdat, and one for Faizabod and Rogun. Varzob will be \nserved from the PMU in Dushanbe. The local representative, located in the raion administration, \nwill  (i)  monitor  implementation  in  the  raion,  (ii)  support  raion  officials  in  implementation, \n(iii) coordinate with local communities to ensure their satisfaction with the Project, (iii) provide \ncoordination between implementing agencies, and (iv) provide statistical data to the PMU. \nDepending on satisfactory progress and need, the possibility of having a representative for each \nraion will be considered during the first major project review (18 months into the Project). \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n76.  The Project will be implemented over 7 years, from March 2007. By 31 March 2014, all \nwithdrawal applications from the loan must have been submitted, approved, and authorized. \nThe closing date for disbursements will be 30 September 2014. The implementation schedule \nfor the Project is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n77.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance the procurement of vehicles, materials, and \nequipment,  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9).  Contracts  valued  at  the \nequivalent of $1 million or more will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). \nContracts valued at less than $1 million equivalent may follow ICB, national competitive bidding \n(NCB), or limited international bidding, as determined by the particular circumstances of the \ncontract package. Contracts below $100,000 equivalent may follow the shopping procedure. \nThe relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption (1998) will be included in all documents \nduring the bidding for, and implementation of, the Project. \n \n78.  Before  the  start  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the \nGovernment\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s requirements. Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications in the Government\u2019s procedures will be documented in \nthe procurement plan. \n \n79.  For the procurement of goods and services to be financed with the subloans to farmers \nfrom the MFIs, the MFIs will demonstrate that the procurement procedures are appropriate \nunder the circumstances, and conform to ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption and to established \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. \n ", " 17\n80.  Advance action is required for consulting services for project implementation to establish \nthe PMU, including the hiring of the project manager, the financial management specialist, and \nthe procurement officer. Retroactive financing of $100,000 equivalent is necessary to cover the \nexpenditures for these activities incurred before loan and grant effectiveness, but not earlier \nthan 12 months before the signing of the Financing Agreement. The advance recruitment of \nconsultants must conform to ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as \namended from time to time). The Government has been advised that approval of the early \nrecruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to approving or otherwise financing the Project. \nAdvance action would enable the early preparation of draft documents for the contracting of \nvarious services required under the Project, and would require the Government to agree to \nfinance the PMU and staff before loan and grant effectiveness (March or April 2007).   \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n81.  The Project will provide 2,260 person-months of consulting services, comprising 184 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  and  2,076  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices.  This  high  level  of  consulting  services,  and  particularly  international  technical \nassistance, is essential, given the nature of the Project and the gap between global good \npractice  and  current  techniques  used  in  Tajikistan.  This  need  applies  in  particular  to  the \nnationwide pasture sector assessment and the development of sustainable agriculture and rural \nadvisory services. Effective project management and monitoring will be equally important to \nensure  the  effective  transfer  of  knowledge  and  conduct  of  the  surveys,  and  continuous \nmonitoring of project outputs and outcome. Institutional and capacity development has been \nbuilt  into  the  project  design.  The  consultants  will  provide  project  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment in land use security; pasture, arable, and forestry pasture land rehabilitation; \ndevelopment of advisory services and market information; infrastructure planning; O&M; and \nproject management and monitoring. \n \n82.  The consultants will be selected under separate consulting-firm contracts, one for the \npasture land sector assessment and implementation (output 1.2), another for the development \nof curricula and capacity in pasture land management at an educational institution (output 2.2), \nand  a  third  for  project  management  (component  5).  The  international  consultants  will  be \nrecruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, with the use of full technical \nproposals  and  quality-based  selection  for  the  pasture  land  sector  assessment  and  the \ndevelopment of curricula and capacity in pasture land management, and full technical proposals \nand quality and cost-based selection for project management. Outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 10 and detailed terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n83.  ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption (1998), as amended to date, was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  of  Tajikistan.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption will be \nincluded in the loan and grant regulations and in the bidding documents for the Project. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will specify the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and of all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n84.  In relation to the Project, the Government will ensure the disclosure of Project-related \nprocurement actions, including consulting services contracts and the procurement of major \nequipment and civil works, in local newspapers and on the internet. Such disclosed information \nwill include, among other matters, the list of participating bidders, the winning bidder, reference ", "18  \nto the tender procedures adopted, the amount of the contract awarded, and general terms and \nspecifications of the goods, works, or services procured.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n85.  The proceeds of the ADB loan and grant will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001), as amended from time to time. For consulting services and \nequipment following ICB procedures, loan and grant funds will be disbursed through direct \npayment. For civil works following NCB procedures and small expenditures related to the PMU, \nreimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be applied. Two imprest accounts will be \nopened by the EA: one for the loan funds and one for the grant funds. These imprest accounts \nwill be established and managed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial \ndeposit in the loan imprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for 6 months of \nproject implementation or 10% of the loan, whichever is less. The initial deposit in the grant \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditure  for  6  months  of  project \nimplementation or 10% of the grant, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) \nprocedure  will  be  applied  when  reimbursing  eligible  project  outlays  and  liquidating  and \nreplenishing the imprest accounts for individual payments of up to $50,000. The EA will submit \nrequests for replenishment to ADB.  \n \n7.  Flow of Funds \n \n86.  Apart from the credit line to be provided through participating MFIs, all loan funds will be \nprovided to the EA in the form of a grant. The credit line will be administered under subsidiary \nloan agreements entered into between the Government, through MOF, and the MFIs, and under \nproject agreements between ADB and each MFI. MOF will lend the credit line funds directly to \nMFIs  licensed  by  the  NBT  as  microfinance  deposit  organizations  or  microfinance  lending \norganizations. The MOF will relend these funds in somoni or US dollars for 10 years, with a 2-\nyear grace period. The interest rate under the subsidiary lending arrangements between the \nGovernment and the MFIs will cover the costs of funds from ADB plus an administration charge. \nThe relending initial rate for loan in TJS will be 75% of the interbank lending rate of the National \nBank of Tajikistan. The relending interest rate for loans in dollars will be at a floating rate based \non the 6-month LIBOR for dollars. The MOF will pass the foreign exchange risk on to the MFIs. \n \n87.  Funds  under  the  credit  line  will  be  onlent  to  farmers  and  agribusinesses  as \nsubborrowers. It is anticipated that the subloans will provide working capital and onfarm and \nbusiness investments for the development of agricultural production, and the development of \ninput supply, machinery services, storage, packing, marketing, and related agribusiness and \nservice  enterprises.  The  subborrowers  will  prepare  business  plans  and  should  have \ncommercially  viable  subprojects  with  adequate  collateral,  financial  rates  of  return,  and  a \ndemonstrated repayment capacity. MFIs will onlend the credit line to eligible subborrowers \nunder separate loan agreements acceptable to ADB. Subject to the procedures agreed on with \nADB, the MFIs will have full authority to select subborrowers, approve subloans, and determine \nlending terms according to their own credit policy. Subloans to subborrowers may be made in \nsomoni or US dollars. The lending arrangements for the subloans from MFIs to subborrowers \nwill be reviewed regularly, as required, and adjusted if necessary. All subloans exceeding \n$20,000 and the first five subloans of each MFI will be approved by ADB before disbursement.  \nAll MFIs will submit a quarterly loan portfolio report and an annual external audit report to ADB \nby 30 June each year. \n \n88.  Funding for the infrastructure subprojects will be channeled from MOF directly to the \nloan imprest account managed by the PMU. The PMU will be responsible for all procurement of  \ngoods, works, and services. Local procurement of parts and materials, and the use of local labor \nin implementation, will be encouraged. The PMU will report to ADB on overall progress in the ", " 19\nimplementation of raion-specific activities, the selection of rural infrastructure proposals, and the \ndisbursement of funds. See Appendix 7 for the flow of funds.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n89.  Project accounts acceptable to ADB will be maintained by the EA through the PMU \naccording to the provisions of the financing agreement and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB.15 The EA, on behalf of \nthe Government and through the PMU, will maintain separate records and accounts that will \nallow goods and services to be financed out of the loan and grant proceeds, and government \nfinancing to be identified and its use to be disclosed, following sound accounting principles. The \naccounts will show total expenditures by category of project output. They will record (i) amounts \nspent by the EA, (ii) amounts by project output, and (iii) amounts by loan and grant financing.  \n \n90.  Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit these accounts and records yearly. \nWithin 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit reports in English, \ntogether with the auditor\u2019s opinion, will be submitted to the Government and ADB. The audit \nreports will include a management letter and a separate opinion on the use of the imprest \naccounts and SOE procedure. The Government has been advised that delays in the submission \nof audited financial statements may result in the suspension of loan and grant disbursements by \nADB.  For the external audit of accounts, the loan proceeds may finance the services of private \nsector auditors and the translation of their reports into English, provided that (i) such auditors \nare qualified, capable, and acceptable to ADB; and (ii) the auditors are recruited in a manner \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n91.  In  addition,  internal  audit  procedures  will  be  established.  A  periodic  auditor,  to  be \nemployed with the use of grant project funds, will spot-check cash, bank account, and all other \nfinancial and related records for the Project at least 1 day per month for the first 3 years. The \nauditor will specifically compare the relative costs of items such as fuel and consumables, and \nof vehicles and equipment, with those under similar projects, and the subsequent use of the \nitems, to ensure fair procurement and specific use for project activities. Subject to the findings of \nthe internal audit, this procedure may be extended.  \n \n92.  The MFIs will be required to maintain separate project accounts for the funds spent \nunder the Project. They must also maintain their overall accounts, audits, and financial status as \nrequired by the NBT and ADB. The MFIs\u2019 annual accounts\u2014comprising balance sheets, income \nstatements, and fund flow statements at a minimum\u2014must conform to international financial \naccounting  standards.  The  annual  accounts  and  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. Copies of the accounts and audit reports in English, \ntogether with the auditor\u2019s opinion and management letter, will be submitted to ADB within 6 \nmonths of the close of each financial year.  \n \n93.  The EA, through the PMU, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate the progress made, problems encountered, steps taken to remedy the problems, a \nprogram of activities, and expected progress during the remaining implementation period. The \nreports will also incorporate the project performance monitoring data and all relevant financial \ndata. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and quality, and will be consistent \nwith international and local reporting standards, as well as with the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). The EA will also provide such other reports and information relating to \nthe project as ADB may reasonably request, including policy and institutional measures related \nto security of land use, development of pasture land, and the enabling environment for business \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2002.

Within  6  months  after  project \ncompletion, the EA, through its PMU, will submit to ADB a project completion report detailing \ninformation  on  project  implementation,  use  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds,  and \naccomplishments regarding the project outcomes and impact.   \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n94.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the planned outputs and outcome, \nthe PMU will establish and maintain a project performance monitoring system within 6 months of \nproject effectiveness. During project inception, a matrix of sub-indicators that substantiate the \ncore performance indicators in Appendix 1 will be developed in a participatory manner. Where \nfeasible, community-based monitoring mechanisms will be developed to strengthen participation \nand community level decision making. The performance monitoring system will be presented to \nthe PSC during project inception for verification. Baseline data for the agreed indicators will be \ngathered, and updated every 6 months. These data will be reported to other development \npartners, interested stakeholders, and the public.  \n \n95.  The GEF-financed activities will require monitoring, evaluation, and reporting to CACILM \nand GEF. Information from the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will feed into the \nCACILM national monitoring and evaluation system, which will cover all CACILM projects in \nTajikistan and will target four types of information: (i) land degradation and sustainable land \nmanagement  indicators  for  the  design  and  monitoring  framework;  (ii)  compliance  with \nenvironmental and social safeguards that may be prescribed by the cofinancing agreements of \nthe  Strategic  Partnership  Agreement16 members;  (iii)  project  implementation,  including  the \nrecording and tracking of work plan progress, all project inputs, and all activities; and (iv) project \nfinances,  including  annual  disbursements,  contracts  awarded,  and  annual  audited  financial \nstatements \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n96.  Semiannual reviews will be conducted in the first few years of project implementation \nuntil ADB determines that an annual review will be sufficient for effective administration and \nimplementation. Besides these regular reviews, a comprehensive review of the Project will be \ncarried out jointly by the Government, MOA, SCLM, and ADB after 18 months, and a midterm \nreview after 3.5 years of implementation. These reviews will, among other things, assess the \noverall progress of the Project and the need for changes in its design and implementation \narrangements. At the end of the Project, the EA will prepare a project completion report and \nsubmit it to ADB within 6 months of project completion. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n97.  The technical assistance Capacity Development for Planning and Management in Local \nGovernment will improve economic and social development in the five raions of Faizabod, \nRogum, Rudaki, Vardat, and Varzob. The outcome is improved capacity in economic and social \nplanning. The TA will focus on: (i) approaches to planning and management appropriate to the \ninstitutional and resource capacity of the raions; (ii) coordination strategies and arrangements to \noptimize the effectiveness of development activities in each raion and in the area of the five \nraions, at jamoat, community, and national levels; (iii) systems and procedures for planning, \n                                                 \n16 Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  for  United  Nations  Convention  to  Combat  Drought  and  Desertification \nImplementation  in  the  Central  Asian  Countries.  The  present  members  are  ADB,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency,  CCD  Project  of  the  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation,  Global  Mechanism, \nInternational Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas, International Fund for Agriculture Development, SDC, \nUNDP, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank.

A grant of $600,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram will finance the services of international (12 person-months) and national consultants \n(108 person-months). MOA will be the EA for the TA, which will be implemented over 36 months, \nfrom  2007.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases.  Details  of  the  TA  are  shown  in \nAppendix 11. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits17 \n \n98.  Without the Project, low incomes and high rates of rural poverty, caused by low crop and \nlivestock yields and an environment that is not conducive to commercial farming, agribusiness, \nand rural enterprises, will persist. The features of this unfavorable environment are: (i) poorly \ndefined and ambiguous land use rights; (ii) distortionary interventions by local government \nagencies in onfarm production and marketing decisions; (iii) very poorly developed input supply \nmarkets; (iv) lack of functioning agricultural extension and rural business advisory services; \n(v) lack of access to credit for onfarm investments, agribusiness, and other rural enterprises; \nand (vi) deteriorating farm and nonfarm rural infrastructure. The Project will address all these \nconstraints to increasing rural incomes by improving crop and livestock yields, pasture land \nmanagement, and opportunities for farmers, agribusinesses, and rural enterprises.  \n \n99.  Improved land use security for about 7,000 farmers, through facilitation of the ongoing \nfarm  restructuring  and  land  registration  process,  in  collaboration  with  other  development \npartners working on land reform issues, is a key benefit. This is expected to stimulate private \nsector-led growth in the agriculture and agribusiness sectors.  \n \n100.  Secure  land  use  rights,  together  with  agricultural  extension  services,  credit,  and \nimproved input supply, are expected to improve crop productivity significantly. The financial \nanalysis based on crop budgets shows an increase in farm-level gross margins by about 105% \nto 171% for different crops 2 years after the expected completion of the Project. The envisaged \nincrease in gross margins is based on a 30\u201340% increase in crop yields. These productivity \nincreases are realistic, because yields significantly declined below their natural potential during \nthe post-Soviet era of civil war. Consequently, per capita incomes are expected to increase to \nTJS580 ($171) for rainfed crop farms and TJS804 ($237) for irrigated farms from a current \naverage per capita income of TJS200 ($60).  \n \n101.  Currently, about 140,000 head of cattle and nearly 200,000 sheep and goats are raised \nin the project area on 350,000 ha of poorly managed pasture lands. Livestock production also \nhas  potential  for  productivity  improvement.  Secure  land  use  and  proper  pasture  land \nmanagement, together with necessary support services, can realistically increase annual milk \nproduction by at least 50%, the total number of calves reared by 100%, lambing percentages by \n100%, and kidding percentages to 150%. These improvements will allow about 35,000 farm \nfamilies that currently have livestock in the project area to increase their incomes and assets \nsignificantly. In addition, the nutrition of these farm families will also improve with increased \nlivestock production. \n \n102.  As shown by the indicative models of financial analysis, the Project\u2019s credit line, together \nwith  rural  business  development  services,  will  generate  significant  benefits  by  supporting \nprofitable agricultural processing and other rural enterprises. The rural infrastructure, prioritized \n                                                 \n17  Supplementary Appendix H contains further details on the financial and economic analysis. ", "22  \nby  the  local  communities  will  remove  existing  physical  infrastructure  constraints.  Indicative \nmodels of three irrigation rehabilitation projects generate an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR)  of  60\u201370%.  The  high  EIRR  is  due  to  the  substantial  sunk  cost  and  low  cost  of \nrehabilitation required to improve the reliability of water supply. For three water supply projects, \nan analysis of the time savings in water collection compared with investment costs shows \nsignificant and robust returns. \n \n103.  The results of the Project-wide economic analysis, excluding the rural infrastructure \ncomponent,  show  an  economic  return  of  18%.  According  to  the  sensitivity  analysis,  the \neconomic returns are stable, with either an increase in cost or a reduction in benefits of 20% or \na  3-year  delay  in  project  benefits  reducing  the  EIRR  to  about  14%.  See  Supplementary \nAppendix H for details on financial and economic analysis. \n \n104.  The Project will bring social benefits by improving land use security, the rural business \nenvironment, access to pastures, and livelihood activities. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nB.  Environment and Social Safeguard Issues \n \n1.  Environment \n \n105.  The Project has been classified as category B by ADB. An IEE has been prepared. The \nProject is not likely to cause any significant negative environmental impact. It is likely to have a \nsignificant  positive  impact  on  soil  and  water  resources,  grassland  productivity,  watershed \ncondition,  agricultural  development,  and  institutional  development.  The  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  outlines  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements. Budgets for environmental staff and environment assessment and monitoring \nactivities have been included. The EMP is to be revised, as necessary, during project inception. \nSpecific environmental assessment and review procedures have been developed, and included \nin  the  EMP,  for  the  environmental  assessment  of  rural  infrastructure  projects  during \nimplementation. The IEE is in Supplementary Appendix I and the summary initial environmental \nexamination is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n2.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n106.  The investments of the type and size anticipated under the Project are not expected to \nhave any significant land acquisition or resettlement impact. Given the possibility of minor land \nacquisition for the construction or rehabilitation of community and raion infrastructure, and the \nlikelihood of impact on productive assets, particularly on agricultural land through irrigation \nrehabilitation, a resettlement framework has been prepared (Appendix 13). When subprojects \nare designed and impacts identified, a short resettlement plan will be prepared according to the \nresettlement framework.  \n \n3.  Indigenous People \n \n107.  In the project area, more than 11% (62,617) of the population is of ethnic minority origin. \nThe  major  ethnic  minority  is  the  ethnic  Uzbek  group,  which  accounts  for  more  than  98% \n(61,365)  of  the  ethnic  population.  However,  more  than  70%  (43,616)  of  the  ethnic  Uzbek \nminority is found in the non-cotton-growing jamoats of Rudaki, 27% (16,723) in Vahdat, and the \nremaining 3% in Varzob. Other smaller ethnic minority groups include Russians (found in very \nsmall numbers in each of the project raions and primarily married to ethnic Tajik), Kyrgyz, and \nUkrainians. \n ", " 23\n108.  A range of specific actions targeted at ethnic minority groups have been designed to \nensure they will also benefit proportionately from the Project. These include: (i) the use of \nfacilitators fluent in the Uzbek language, (ii) the inclusion of at least one ethnic Uzbek facilitator, \nwhere necessary, among community-based facilitators in local communities; (iii) the hiring of a \nnational gender and social development specialist with an understanding of ethnic minority \ndevelopment issues, to spend up to 30% of the consulting assignment supporting ethnic Uzbek \ncommunities; and (iv) budget support specifically for the monitoring of project impact on ethnic \nminority groups, including the use of participatory techniques to ensure the active involvement \nof ethnic minority stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation of project benefits. More details \non specific actions for ethnic minorities are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n109.  Key findings of the gender analysis show the need to address specific gender issues. \nThe Project will take actions to: (i) improve women\u2019s formal access to land, thereby increasing \nland use security; (ii) adopt participatory processes to facilitate the active participation of women \nin the Project, including demand-driven, community-based infrastructure projects; (iii) provide \nbusiness advisory services to women and leverage access to microcredit through MFIs for a \nrange of farm and nonfarm activities; (iv) increase the agricultural knowledge of women; and \n(v) promote gender responsiveness among policy makers and other stakeholders involved in \nthe Project. More specific actions for each project component are contained in the gender action \nplan  (Appendix  14).  To  enhance  participation,  a  participation  plan  has  been  prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix L). \n \nD.  Project Sustainability \n \n110.  Project sustainability depends on five main factors: (i) land use security, (ii) sustainable \nland management, (iii) continuous provision of agricultural extension and business development \nservices, (iv) maintenance of rural infrastructure, and (v) continuous provision of credit for \nonfarm investments and agribusinesses.  \n \n111.  The  Project  will  facilitate  the  registration  of  farms  and  access  to  legal  services. \nInfrastructure investment will be contingent on the satisfactory performance of raion and jamoat \nofficials in ensuring land use security. \n \n112.  The Project will demonstrate new sustainable land management practices, build capacity \nand demonstrate skills in their use, and rehabilitate degraded lands. The proposed activities will \ncontribute to an enabling environment, within which land improvement and rural development \ncan take place in an integrated manner. Resulting improvements in the productivity of land will \ncontribute to increases in farm incomes, further reinforcing project sustainability. \n \n113.  Agricultural  and  business  development  services  will  be  provided  at  the  start  by \ncontracted NGOs or other organizations with the capacity to deliver these services efficiently. \nThese  will  establish  advisory  centers,  which  will  be  registered  as  independent  public \nassociations. \n \n114.  A  set  of  criteria  will  be  developed  for  determining  the  feasibility  of  each  rural \ninfrastructure subproject proposed for funding under the  Project. Among other criteria, the \nproponents should demonstrate the financial, physical, and institutional capacity to maintain the \nproposed infrastructure. Subproject proposals that cannot demonstrate sustainability of O&M \nwill not be funded by the Project. \n \n115.  The  credit  line  will  be  developed  without  any  distortions  in  the  financial  market \nparameters and will be operated under prevailing market conditions. Therefore, the participating ", "24  \nMFIs  are  likely  to  generate  adequate  revenue  to  continue  their  credit  operations  in  the \nagriculture sector after the Project. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n \n116.  There  are  some  risks  associated  with  the  Project.  The  success  of  market-oriented \nprivate farming and agribusiness depends heavily on the provision of secure land use rights to \nfarmers and an improved enabling business environment. While appropriate legislation exists, \nthese  laws  are  variously  translated  into  meaningful  actions  at  the  local  level.  The \nimplementation of the land use reform and farm restructuring program without any unnecessary \nintervention from regional and local government authorities is important for the success of the \nProject. The Project attempts to reduce this risk through continuous dialogue with higher levels \nof government, and necessary training and capacity development for both farmers and local \ngovernment officials, to facilitate the reform process. \n \n117.  The Project includes the implementation of existing land use policy and legislation, \ninvestments, capacity development, and the dissemination of technical and business-related \nknowledge.  The  knowledge  and  capacity  development  components,  generally,  have  much \nhigher multiplier impact, but the benefits are long-term and mostly intangible. There is a risk that \nthe investment components, particularly infrastructure components, may assume a prominent \nrole  in  the  Project  and  take  resources  away  from  the  policy,  capacity  development,  and \nknowledge components. The Project addresses this risk by applying a cap on the infrastructure \ncomponent of the Project. \n \n118.  The development partner community has noted corruption, fraud, and abuse of funds in \nprevious and current projects. ADB will address these issues by ensuring that proper accounting \nand procurement staff will be placed in the PMU. In addition, an independent audit of the \naccounts by a certified and reputable auditing firm will be conducted to reduce the risk of misuse \nof ADB funds. \n \n119.  Poor  financial  management  capacity  of  the  government  agencies  poses  a  financial \nmanagement risk. Adequate capacity will be built in the PMU to reduce this risk.  \n \n120.  Another potential risk to the Project is a drop in the prices of agricultural commodities \ndue to oversupply. The main market targeted by the Project is Dushanbe, and its growth in \ndemand  is  limited.  The  Project  plans  to  mitigate  this  risk  through  improved  processing  of \nagricultural  products  by  providing  credit  and  business  development  support  services.  In \naddition, the business development service will explore possibilities for improving the export of \nfresh and processed produce. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n121.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has agreed to include the \nfollowing assurances in the legal documents: \n(i)  The  Government  shall  make  available  all  counterpart  funds  required  for  the \nProject and on an annual basis for each fiscal year make adequate budgetary \nallocations required to implement the Project, including the requirements of the \nIEE,  EMP,  gender  action  plan,  participation  plan,  specific  actions  for  ethnic \nminorities, and resettlement framework; \n(ii)  The land use rights of farmers shall be improved by (a) issuing the required land \nuse certificates in all dekhan farms in the project area, and (b) protecting farmers ", " 25\nfrom arbitrary cancellation of land use certificates and eviction from farmland \nwithout due process; \n(iii)  A simplified registration procedure for businesses in the project area shall be \nimplemented within 3 years of the effective date, on a pilot basis and within the \nexisting legislative framework; \n(iv)  Within 2 years of the effective date, the Government shall adopt a national policy, \nstrategy,  and  investment  plan  for  the  management  of  pasture  lands  and \nlivestock.

Alternatively, the Government may make other arrangements necessary \nto cover the funding shortfall, acceptable to ADB.  \n  \nB.  Conditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n \n122.  The Government has agreed to meet the following conditions to Loan effectiveness:  \n(i)   (a) the Project Management Unit shall have been established and shall have \nsufficient offices and facilities as required for the Project; (b) the Project manager, \nacceptable  to  ADB,  shall  have  been  appointed;  and  (c)  an  accountant  and ", "26  \nprocurement  specialist,  in  each  case,  acceptable  to  ADB,  shall  have  been \nappointed. \n(ii)  the Government shall have (a) identified an existing project management unit that \nhas the capacity, staffing and expertise required to function as the PMU for the \nProject as an integrated unit; and (b) provided ADB with information, in sufficient \ndetail, describing and demonstrating the capacity of such project management \nunit and the interagency coordination arrangements to be entered into between \nthe  Project  Executing  Agency  and  the  agency  otherwise  responsible  for \noverseeing the existing project management unit, in each case, to the satisfaction \nof ADB. \n \nC.

After independence in 1991, Tajikistan, one of the least-developed members of the \nformer Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), suffered huge shocks, first from the abrupt \ntermination of economic support from Russia, and then from a protracted civil war from 1992 to \n1997. By 1997, gross domestic product (GDP) had fallen by about 60% to $175 per capita. \nEconomic recovery began in 1997 with the end of the civil war. The improved political and \neconomic stability provided the base for the recovery, which further benefited from favorable \nprices for cotton and aluminum, strong regional economic growth, particularly in Russia, a \nsubstantial  flow  of  remittances  from  Russia,1  and  increased  support  from  the  international \ncommunity. Agriculture and the service sector benefited most. \n \n2.  GDP has grown by about 10% yearly since 2000, and the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) expects growth of 6% for 2006\u20132007. Inflation fell from 39% in 2001 to about 7% in 2005. \nThe fiscal deficit has remained at less than 3% of GDP, despite a significant increase in \ninternally funded public investment. The current account balance has remained stable at 3.8% \nof GDP since 2002, despite increased imports. External debt has been halved since 2001 \nfollowing debt write-offs by Russia and Pakistan. At least 50% of Tajikistan\u2019s GDP is estimated \nto be generated by the informal sector. \n \n3.  Tajikistan has an open trade policy, with an export-to-GDP ratio of 51% in 2003. Tariffs \nare low, 7.5% on average, and there are few official nontariff restrictions on trade. However, \nmost goods are transported through Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan, adding significant formal and \ninformal fees to the transaction costs and also creating uncertainty and instability in trade \nrelationships. Cotton, aluminum, and electricity account for about 85% of exports; the narrow \ncommodity export base makes Tajikistan vulnerable to changes in world commodity prices. The \nGovernment applied to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in May 2001 and is negotiating \naccession. \n \n4.  Despite substantial progress, Tajikistan remains deeply poor (GDP of $311 per capita in \n2004). The domestic market is constrained by a small population and low incomes, and the \ncountry\u2019s high mountains and remote location create formidable barriers to both internal and \nexternal trade. Infrastructure development is difficult and expensive, although some progress is \nbeing made in improving main national road links. A major obstacle to continued economic \nprogress is the large debt of cotton farms (about $300 million). \n \n5.  A  weak  tax  base  (16%  of  GDP  in  2005)  inhibits  both  public  investment  in  and \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure.  Slow  and  incomplete  structural  reform  continues  to  impede \nprivate sector development, and there are significant capacity constraints in both the public and \nprivate sectors. High transaction costs caused by widespread corruption and inappropriate \nregulation further impede the private sector and contribute to the expansion of the informal \nsector. \n \n6.   Private investment is inhibited by the small size of the banking sector (total lending in \n2005 was only 9% of GDP, and deposits were only 4% of GDP), high interest rates, and limited \naccess to medium-term capital. \n                                                 \n1  Estimates of remittance income in 2004 range from $433 million to $1 billion per year, equivalent to 21\u201350% of \nGDP (See International Monetary Fund 2005) Article IV Consultation with Republic of Tajikistan. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nB.  Role of Agriculture \n \n7.  Agriculture  is  a  key  sector  of  the  economy,  accounting  for  24%  of  GDP,  66%  of \nemployment, 26% of exports, and 39% of tax revenue. Over 72% of the population, about four \nmillion people, depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture has accounted for one third \nof economic growth since 1997 and has thus made a major contribution to the decrease in rural \npoverty. Rural poverty incidence fell from 83% in 1999 to 64% in 2003. \n \n8.  Agricultural land in Tajikistan covers about 4.6 million hectares (ha), made up of pasture \n(3.8 million ha), arable land (732,000 ha), and perennial crops (103,000 ha). The total irrigated \narea is about 732,000 ha, of which pump irrigation covers about 338,000 ha, or 46% of the total \nirrigated land. Irrigation serves 504,000 ha of arable land, 122,600 ha of household plots, \n79,500 ha of orchards and vineyards, and 25,900 ha for other uses. The main irrigated crops \nare cotton, grains (wheat and corn), fruits, and vegetables. \n  \n9.  Land reform has been continuing for several years, with land use certificates issued for \nsome 60% of arable land by the State Committee for Land Management (SCLM).2 Generally, \nland reform has failed to provide equitable and secure land-use rights to farmers. Moreover, \nambiguous  land-use  rights  have  undermined  incentives  to  produce  and  to  invest  in  land \nimprovement. Despite their eligibility by law, some rural people have been denied their land \nrights. Local government officials have enormous latitude in interpreting land-use rights. \n  \n10.  Farming  in  the  hills  and  mountains  enjoys  more  freedom  from  interference  by \ngovernment officials.3  Still, the rural population is compelled to follow orders issued by the local \nauthorities. In a variety of complex arrangements, farmers are often asked to produce and \ndeliver certain products or provide certain services in return for being granted plots of land or \naccess to a pasture, or obtaining tax relief. Overall, these arrangements severely dampen \nincentives and keep the farming population preoccupied primarily with their household plots and \nsubsistence farming. \n \n11.  The rural population depends on household plots for subsistence. Household plots are \nessential for survival in the absence of alternative employment opportunities and formidable \ndifficulties in start-ups of private commercial farming. These plots are largely free of state \ninterference; farmers can choose what they produce, consume, or sell. The size of household \nplots is about 0.10\u20130.15 ha for irrigated land, and about double that for nonirrigated land, \nusually in higher-rainfall hilly and mountainous areas. Land use is intense and land productivity \nhigh. Many irrigated plots are double- and sometimes triple-cropped, with potatoes and other \ncrops  mostly  for  home  consumption  and  the  rest  (onions,  carrots,  eggplants,  cabbage, \ncauliflower, etc.) for the market. Occasionally, even wheat is grown on the household plots \nmainly because it stores well and lasts until late winter and early spring, when poor households \ntend to run out of supplies for themselves and their livestock. Nearly all household plots have \nfruit and fuelwood trees. In addition, the plots in part sustain large and small livestock on crop \nresidue. Household plots are also by far the most productive segment of agriculture, accounting \nfor well over 50% of the value of agriculture production on about 12% of arable land. Various \n                                                 \n2  Land use certificates issued in the project area ranges from 40% in Faizobod to 72% in Rudaki. These estimates \nuse individual dekhan farms as a proxy, since all were granted certificates. Some members of collective dekhan \nfarms may have been issued certificates. However, there are major data inconsistencies between the raion \nbranches of SCLM and the SCLM headquarters. \n3  For example, land reform has been completed in the Gorno Badakshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO), with all \nfarmers issued land certificates. GBAO is the most remote area in Tajikistan. Since 1992 it has been supported by \nthe Aga Khan Foundation. ", "Appendix 2  35\nsurveys indicate that about 50% of consumption and more than 60% of household income stem \nfrom  these  plots.4  The  gross  value  of  agricultural  production  of  household  plots  is  about \nTJS2,770 ($820) per ha, which is about three times that of dekhan farms and 4.6 times higher \nthan that of old collective farms. \n \n12.  The  composition  of  agricultural  output  changed  substantially  after  independence, \nbecause of changes in cropping patterns and a fall in livestock numbers. The contribution of \ncrops increased from 60% to 80% of gross agricultural output. Crop yields have increased \nsubstantially since 1998, although they remain extremely low by regional and international \nstandards. Political and economic stability has brought about increased use of fertilizer, which \nhas driven up yields. Still, limited access to good-quality seed (home-saved seed is used most \noften) and the near absence of mechanized equipment pose severe technical constraints on \nagriculture growth. Over 50% of farm equipment is out of order and new equipment is generally \nunaffordable. As a result of the limited availability of mechanized equipment, most agricultural \noperations are done manually and mechanized equipment is being replaced by horse-drawn \nimplements. \n \n13.  Cotton is the most important crop in Tajikistan in terms of rural employment (50% of the \nlabor force) and export earnings. Exported mainly as raw fiber, it generates about 17% of export \nearnings and 11% of GDP (2004). The most significant trend in the last few years has been the \nsubstantial increase in wheat production and other food crops, which has improved nutrition and \ncontributed  to  poverty  reduction.  Crop  production  has  grown  much  faster  than  livestock \nproduction, accounting for 80% of sector growth from 1999 to 2003. Crop production has shifted \nfrom high-value crops during the Soviet era to lower-value cereal crops partly because of the \nlack of effective domestic and export demand, and also because of food security concerns and \na drift to subsistence farming. Increased cropped areas, especially for wheat, encroach on \nmarginal lands, aggravating soil erosion and causing long-term environmental damage. \n \n14.  Produced on about 170,000 ha of arable land, fruits and vegetables are a traditional \ndomain of Tajik agriculture, particularly in the hills and mountains. Over 70% of horticulture \noutput  (about  one  million  tons  of  fruits  and  vegetables)  is  produced  on  household  plots. \nProduction is mainly for home consumption, barter trade, and opportunistic sales. Orchards and \nvineyards need replacement because of neglect, infestation, and disease. Postharvest losses \nare large because of poor or even absent storage and processing facilities. The processing of \nfruits and vegetables is divided into canning and drying. The privatized industrial canning sector \ncomprises about 32 plants, which are deeply underutilized (utilization is generally less than \n30%) and obsolete. Processing equipment dates back to the 1930s with some renovations. \nProducing juices, pickles, jams, and tomato paste, most plants have throughput of less than one \nmillion liters a year. Total production is estimated at about 45 million liters. Current margins are \nestimated  at  less  than  5%  of  gross  revenues.  Growers  try  to  avoid  industrial  processing \nbecause of low prices and uncertain payment. They prefer small-scale natural sun drying or \nother methods. \n \n15.  Agricultural export is limited to cotton, and fruits and vegetables. Cotton accounts for 85\u2013\n90% of agriculture exports, and fresh and processed fruit and vegetables for the remaining 10\u2013\n15%. The Russian food market is evolving quickly as consumer income grows and international \nsupermarkets expand, making it increasingly difficult for Tajik products to compete. Wheat, flour, \n                                                 \n4  For example, see baseline update survey under the World Bank Farm Privatization Support Project, and the Rural \nInfrastructure Rehabilitation Project, unpublished working draft, September 2003 to January 2004, Monitoring and \nEvaluation Unit, Rural Information and Advisory Services. Also, see the Tajikistan Living Standard Survey. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nand edible oils are the main food imports, but these account for less than 5% of total imports. \nMost fertilizer, agrochemicals, and fuel are imported from neighboring countries, and quality \ntends to be unreliable. \n \n16.  The  commercial  livestock  sector  has  essentially  collapsed.  Cattle,  small  stock,  and \npoultry numbers have declined and livestock ownership has shifted to households, which own \nabout 90% of all livestock, and are the dominant suppliers of milk, meat, and other livestock \nproducts. Sheep and cattle numbers have been recovering slowly since the Civil War. Goat, \nyak, and horse numbers have been steadily increasing and now exceed their numbers at \nindependence. With the exception of pig production and remittances, cattle and sheep are the \nmain sources of income for those rural households with livestock. Livestock manure is important \nfor garden plots and dried as fuel in winter. Horses are important as a substitute for tractors. \n \n17.  Milk and meat production is low (1,000\u20131,400 kilograms [kg] per dairy cow). Low fertility \n(on average, 50\u201355 calves per 100 cows) adversely affects milk and meat production. The \nweight of animals for meat production has declined on average by about 10\u201315%. Sheep and \ngoats suffer similar problems as cattle. Fine angora sheep reared in mountainous regions used \nto be highly profitable but have now nearly vanished. Annual average wool production per \nsheep is stable, although total production has dropped. \n \n18.  Poor livestock nutrition is caused mainly by the lack of suitable fodder especially in late \nwinter and early spring, and limited access to pastures throughout the year. Households have \nvery limited access to pastures, which is a major problem for them and the environment. Often \nthey cannot afford or are unwilling to pay for access to pastures controlled by dekhan farms or \nraion  officials.  They  are  forced  to  have  their  animals  graze  near  settlements,  causing \novergrazing and environmental damage. Households control about 10% of cultivated area for \nfodder and less than 1% of pastures, although they keep 90% of all livestock and account for \n90% of meat, 90% of milk, and 69% of egg production. Dekhan farms control about 36% of the \narea cultivated with fodder crops, and 67% of pastures, although they keep less than 6% of \nlivestock and produce 2% of meat, 2% of milk, and less than 1% of eggs. Other agriculture \nenterprises (e.g., state breeding farms, old collective farms) control over 54% of cultivated areas \nfor fodder and about 33% of pastures, although they keep only 11% of livestock and produce \n8% of meat, 8% of milk, and 30% of eggs. \n \n19.  Other major problems in the livestock sector relate to animal diseases. The capacity to \ncontrol diseases has declined considerably because of the reduced reach of veterinary services \nand the low supply of effective drugs caused in part by an inability to pay. Veterinary services \nhave deteriorated especially in the more remote parts of the country. Suitable prophylactic \nmeasures  are  neglected,  and  livestock  disease,  notably  brucellosis,  and  foot  and  mouth \ndisease, is a serious issue. \n \n20.  Livestock  processing  plants  have  been  privatized  but  operate  at  a  fraction  of  their \ninstalled capacity, often in unsanitary conditions and with obsolete equipment. Farmers try to \navoid these facilities, selling milk directly to consumers and meat mainly through bazaars. \n \n21.

The  size  of  the  market  for  microfinance  loans  was  evaluated  in  a  2003  study5 \ncommissioned  and  funded  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  and  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency (CIDA).

This is the equivalent of about \n$90  million  at  the  year-end  exchange  rates  and  supports  the  findings  of  the  2003  study. \nHowever, the volume of lending may have been larger, as not all microfinance programs are \nregistered with NBT. \n \n25.  The NBT figures also indicate that TJS296 million of microfinance lending represented \n55,000 loans. This suggests an average loan size of TJS5,380.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide financing of $17.1 million for the Rural \nDevelopment Project. From this total, the Government of Tajikistan is requesting an Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  IX  Grant  allocation  of  $8.3  million  to  finance  the  following: \ninternational and national consultants to undertake the national pasture land sector assessment \nand  associated  international  and  national  workshops;  the  contracting  of  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) to develop agricultural and rural business advisory services; selected \nequipment and vehicles to support project implementation; and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nA.  Constraints on Growth and Poverty Reduction \n \n2.  Fiscal Weakness and Narrow Economic Base. At the macro level, the country has \naccumulated a massive external debt. Despite improvements in managing the fiscal deficit, the \nGovernment faces significant structural impediments that limit its capacity to invest in basic \nsocial  services  and  infrastructure  and  prevent  the  country  from  initiating  poverty-reducing \nmeasures. One major structural bottleneck is its limited revenue sources. The Government \nrelies mainly on its narrow export base (aluminum, cotton, and hydropower) for tax receipts. In \npast  years,  the  cotton  subsector  alone  generated  about  35%  of  tax  revenues.  For  the \nGovernment to address its fiscal situation there is need for the economy to diversify its income-\ngenerating activities and improve the performance of its revenue sources. \n \n3.  Farmers and business entrepreneurs have limited freedom to engage in commercial \nfarming and rural business because of the restricted enabling environment. Most people have \nnot  been  adequately  informed  of  their  rights  and  are  dissatisfied  with  the  allocation  and \ndemarcation  of  land  parcels.  In  addition,  authorities  can  take  and  reallocate  land  if  it  is \nconsidered to be used improperly or irrationally. Moreover, farmers are subject to extensive \nadministrative interference in making production and marketing decisions. This creates a high \nlevel  of  insecurity  among  the  population  with  respect  to  land-use  rights  and  discourages \ninvestments in land and farming. \n \n4.  The business environment is influenced by the variable conditions caused by differing \ninterpretations of national legislation and a lack of knowledge on the part of local officials, which \nresult  in  unpredictable  behavior  by  local  government  officials  and  a  lack  of  incentives  for \npotential farming and business entrepreneurs to invest and conduct commercial business. A \nmore favorable business environment is essential to the development of small and medium \nenterprises to deliver input supplies, rural services, storage, processing, equipment dealerships, \nfinancial services, and other activities for an emerging market economy.  \n \n5.  Extensive Land Degradation. The largest category of land in Tajikistan is grassland. \nPasture  management  and  livestock  production  systems  have  collapsed  and  social  and \neconomic  conditions  have  changed  dramatically.  Livestock  are  a  key  component  of  most \nhouseholds\u2019 livelihood strategies, with about 90% of cattle owned by households. The sector is \ncharacterized by complex tenure systems and has been effectively bypassed by land reform. In \naddition, about 50% of forest land is also considered to be under pasture, and a policy on \nforestland management has been formulated. There is a need to reorient forest management \ntoward  the  changing  needs  of  local  communities,  toward  comanagement  of  woodlots  and \nshelterbelts, better coordination of forest management and grazing inside and outside forest \n ", "42  Appendix 4 \nlands, and more active promotion of on-farm and household tree planting.1 It is necessary to \ndemonstrate land improvement techniques and measures to address this land degradation, \nwhich occurs in a variety of conditions. \n \n6.  Farmers  and  rural  businesses  lack  professional  agriculture  and  business  support \nservices and are disempowered as a result. Such services are currently being provided by a \nnumber of NGOs and institutes. An approach is needed to provide services in a flexible manner \nto meet the needs of farmers without generating the high overhead costs associated with formal \ninstitutional  arrangements  and  without  creating  additional  requirements  for  recurrent \ngovernment expenditure.  \n \n7.  Market information is crucial to decision making by farmers and business entrepreneurs. \nAt present, while some information exists, it is not timely, often irregular, and not available to a \nwide audience. The aim will be to build a network that will collect, analyze, and disseminate \nmarket information in a form that can be used by advisers, farmers, and entrepreneurs. \n \n8.  Economic Infrastructure in Disrepair. Road and bridges need rehabilitation to provide \nmore reliable and improved access to markets and services, irrigation systems require major \nrepair,  drinking  water  is  often  inaccessible,  and  electricity  supply  is  constantly  disrupted, \nparticularly in winter.  \n \n9.  Weak  National  and  Local  Institutions.  All  central  government  institutions  are \nhampered by lack of financial resources: their budgets cannot cover much more than salaries. \nSimilar  difficulties  exist  at  raion  and  jamoat  levels.  Skills  in  planning,  particularly  involving \ninterrelationships between different parts of the economy are lacking. Clear accountability for \nperformance is absent, and controls on performance are based on perceptions of results by the \nraion governor. The budgeting process does not allow for longer-term financial planning. \n \nB.   Proposed Activities \n \n10.  A summary of the cost estimates for the grant is provided in the table.  \n \n11.  The ADF IX grant will finance the participation of international and national consultants, \nwho will provide services to increase land use security. They will undertake the nationwide \npasture land management study; assess and develop more streamlined registration procedures \nfor farms and businesses in rural areas; establish, through NGO contracts, agriculture and rural \nadvisory  service  centers  and  a  management  information  system;  support  the  design  and \nsupervision of raion and community infrastructure and provide capacity development in the \nplanning  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure;  and  provide  further  technical,  accounting,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation staff for effective project implementation. \n \n12.  The ADF IX grant will also provide vehicles and equipment to support the pasture land \nstudy,  sector  assessment  demonstrations  of  improved  pasture  land  management,  and  the \nproject management unit. \n                                                 \n1  Central Asian Countries Initiative on Land Management (CACILM). 2005.

Objectives and Scope \n \n1.  An  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Development  for  Planning  and \nManagement in Local Government is being processed in conjunction with the Project. The TA \nwill support the raions in developing appropriate approaches, systems, and procedures for \nplanning and managing development in the raions. \n \n2.  Raion and jamoat officials are handicapped in developing strong local economies by \ntheir divided reporting lines to central ministries and oblast governments; a traditional top-down \napproach to planning that lacks clear prioritization or links to associated budgetary allocations; \nand a lack of reengineering of the raion and jamoat role and contribution to local development \nand  service  provision  to  reflect  changes  in  the  post-Soviet  environment  in  which  these \ninstitutions now operate. Work under the TA will be limited to those departments and activities \nthat relate to rural economic development. Other services, such as health and education, will \nnot be covered by the TA. \n \n3.  The TA will focus on: (i) approaches to planning and management appropriate to the \ninstitutional and resource capacity of the raions; (ii) coordination strategies and arrangements to \noptimize the effectiveness of development activities in each raion and in the area of the five \nraions, at the jamoat, community, and national levels; (iii) systems and procedures for planning, \nbudgeting, and monitoring financial and implementation activities; (iv) increased capacity of \nraions to identify and prioritize needs and plan and implement local development activities; \n(v) increased community participation in defining local development priorities and actions; and  \n(vi) improved performance management overall. \n \n4.  The TA will be broken down into two phases: Phase 1, the diagnostic phase; and \nPhase II, the development and implementation of improvements. Phase I will involve: (i) a \nreview of the nature and scope of, and responsibilities for, planning, including consultation with \nrelevant  ministries in Dushanbe, jamoats, and the communities; (ii) an assessment of raion and \njamoat roles, responsibilities, and resources available for carrying out these responsibilities; \n(iii) an assessment of the skill levels of staff, and their training needs; (iv) identification of the \nscope for increased community participation in planning; (v) a review of information systems \nused by raion and jamoat staff, and the scope for improvement; (vi) an assessment of priorities \nfor assistance, based on desirable levels of performance and value-added contributions by local \ngovernment institutions; (vii) an assessment of the scope for decentralization of responsibilities \nfrom central government ministries to raions or jamoats; (viii) identification of the costs of \nactivities such as tax collection, and comparison of these costs with the revenues raised; \n(ix) recommendation  of  institutional  restructuring  needed  to  improve  cost-effective  service \ndelivery; and (ix) conduct of workshops to reach agreement on the scope for improvement. \n \n5.  Phase II of the TA will: (i) develop and pilot a process for improved planning and \nresource allocation, including adequate measurement of community consultation performance; \n(ii) using these processes, assist local administrations in developing prioritized, integrated rural \ndevelopment plans that support farm and nonfarm activities and bring greater wealth to the \ncommunities  involved;  (iii)  assist  local  administrations  in  developing  an  inventory  of  local \ninfrastructure and deferred maintenance; (iv) develop and deliver training programs addressing \nkey skill gaps of staff; and (v) design and implement low-cost management information and \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \nperformance  appraisal  reporting  systems  that  can  be  implemented  with  the  available \ntechnologies.1 \n \nB.  Consultants \n \n6.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will engage one international consultant as team \nleader and regional planner (12 person-months), and three national consultants (36 person-\nmonths  each):  an  agricultural  economist  and  regional  planner,  a  financial  management \nspecialist, and a social development specialist.  \n \n7.  The team leader will provide overall guidance to the national consultants in carrying out \nthe activities proposed under Phases 1 and 2. In particular, he/she will lead the team in: \n(i) reviewing  the  current  approach,  systems,  and  procedures  for  planning,  budgeting, \nimplementing, and monitoring development activities in each raion; (ii) assessing the raion and \njamoat roles, responsibilities, and resources available for carrying out their responsibilities; \n(iii) assessing the priorities for assistance, on the basis of desirable levels of performance and \nvalue-added  contributions  by  local  government  institutions;  (iv)  assessing  the  scope  for \ndecentralization of responsibilities from central government ministries to raions or jamoats; \n(v) recommending  any  institutional  restructuring  required  to  improve  cost-effective  service \ndelivery; (vi) developing and piloting a process for improved planning and resource allocation, \nincluding adequate measurement of community consultation performance; (vii) developing and \ndelivering with the local consultants training programs addressing key skill gaps of staff; and \n(viii) designing and implementing low-cost management information and performance appraisal \nreporting systems that can be implemented with the available technologies. \n \n8.  The national consultants, under the guidance of the team leader in the broader activities \nof the TA, will undertake the following individual specific activities. The agricultural economist \nand regional planner will: (i) act as deputy team leader; (ii) assess the skill level of raion and \njamoat staff and identify training needs; (iii) identify the costs of activities such as tax collection \nand compare these with the revenues raised; (iv) design and implement baseline surveys in \neach raion; (v) conduct workshops to reach agreement on the scope for improvement; (vi) assist \nwith the training of staff; (vii) assist the staff in the preparation of a regional agriculture and rural \ndevelopment plan and investment program; and (viii) assist local administrations in developing \nan inventory of local infrastructure and deferred maintenance. \n \n9.  The financial management specialist will: (i) review the raion\u2019s financial system; (ii) set \nup an appropriate financial system, including procedures and formats, and prepare a manual on \nproject management; and (iii) train raion staff.  \n \n10.  The social development specialist will: (i) identify the scope for increased community \nparticipation  in  the  planning  processes;  (ii)  develop  adequate  measurement  of  community \nconsultation performance; (iii) assist with the design and implementation of the baseline surveys \nin each raion; (iv) assist with the training of staff; and (v) develop appropriate monitoring \nsystems and procedures to capture the social and gender aspects of agriculture and rural \ndevelopment.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Because of a shortage of computers and electricity supplies, simple manual systems may have to be used. \n ", "Appendix 11  57\nC.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n    Yes   Is  the  sector  identified  as  a  national   Yes  \nIs  the  sector  identified    priority in country poverty partnership   \nas a national priority in      No   agreement?1    No  \ncountry  poverty \nanalysis?  \n \nThe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP 2002) provides the Government\u2019s coordinated framework for addressing \npoverty in Tajikistan. Rural development plays a critical role in reducing poverty by generating a widespread increase in \nfarm incomes and creating opportunities for growth in rural services and industry. To be successful, the poverty \nstrategy for the sector should address three areas: (a) efficient use of, and access of the poor to, key resources, in \nparticular land and water; (b) creation of a favorable framework for developing private activity in the sector; and \n(c) reform of the management system in the sector, including intervention in decision making by the private sector. In its \n(draft) National Development Strategy (2006), the Government, while reiterating the critical role of rural development, \nquestions the efficiency of land reform, as producers (especially those involved in cotton) do not exercise full control \nover  production,  sales,  and  land  rights  in  general;  ownership  of  land  in  private  farms  remains  collectivized, \nexacerbating ineffective land use; and most of the rural infrastructure (rural roads, irrigation systems) does not have \nproper owners and is not properly maintained. Deteriorating infrastructure further hinders agricultural production with \ndirect impact on poverty reduction. \n \nThe project area covers about 8,350 square kilometers with a rural population of 552,100 in five raions: Faizobod, \nRoghun, Rudaki, Vahdat, and Varzob. This area accounts for about 10% of the country\u2019s official gross development \nproduct (GDP), 77% of which originates in agriculture. Dependent largely on subsistence agriculture, the people have \nfew business and employment opportunities. Many seek seasonal casual work opportunities abroad, mainly in Russia. \nFarmland  and  pastures  are  the  main  productive  resources.  The  project  area  population  relies  on  agriculture, \nmiscellaneous petty trade, and foreign remittances for their livelihood.  \n \nThere is no official poverty line for Tajikistan, but income poverty is widespread and severe in the countryside, \nespecially in the cotton-growing areas. According to the Tajikistan Living Standards Survey, which relies on the World \nBank threshold of $2.15/person/day, absolute poverty was 81% in 1999 and declined to 63% in 2003.  Poverty is more \nprevalent in rural areas, where over 84% of all households in 1999 and 68% in 2003 were estimated to be living in \nrelative poverty. In the five project raions, which are in the Regions of Republican Subordination (RRS), relative poverty \nrates are lower than in other predominantly rural regions. The relative poverty rate was 73% in 1999 and 55% in 2003, \nand is about 45% in 2006. Urban poverty rates are lower: the overall poverty rate for the Dushanbe region was 69% in \n1999 and 49% in 2003, and is about 40% in 2006. These estimates are in sharp contrast to those provided by the five \nproject raions, which show an overall relative poverty rate of 67%, varying from a high of 76% in Roghun (with the \nsmallest percentage, at 46%, engaged in agricultural employment) to a low of 58% in Faizobod (with the largest \npercentage, at 82%, engaged in agricultural employment). Agro-ecological factors and distance from Dushanbe could \npartly explain these differences, but raions closer to Dushanbe (e.g., Vahdat, with a higher estimated GDP per capita of \nTJS460) are, according to local raion estimates, poorer (66% relative poverty rate). It should also be stressed that non-\nincome-related aspects of poverty, especially those relating to health (reproductive health indicators have seen an \nincrease in infant mortality rate), sanitation (access to potable water is problematic), and education (participation rates \nfor girls in secondary education have fallen), have also affected the poor, with greatest impact on women and girls. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                               Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nPoverty statistics nationwide indicate that the incidence of poverty is decreasing and this is also indicated in the project \npreparatory technical assistance Socioeconomic Survey, although the findings of this survey demonstrate there are at \nleast 20% of households living in absolute poverty and another 20% living in relative poverty (slightly less in total than \nthe estimated 45% for the RRS region). During a series of participatory rural appraisals facilitated by the TA, poorer \nhouseholds generally prioritized agricultural-type interventions lower than those associated with improved access to \nwater, non-agricultural-based income generation opportunities, access to affordable sources of credit, and a reduction \nin the cost of access to health services. In relation to agricultural-type interventions, the emphasis was on access to \nimproved seed varieties and better knowledge of cropping techniques to increase productivity on household plots. \n \nIn the project area, the poor and vulnerable are relatively easy to identify. The major indicators are lack of livestock, \nlimited or no access to arable land apart from household plots either through use rights (land certificates) or ability to \nrent portions of land, poor diet (lack of meat on a regular basis and limited consumption of dairy products), inferior \n                                                 \n1   Tajikistan adopted its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP 2002), and is finalizing its PRSP Realization Report \n(2002\u20132006). It concluded a Poverty Partnership Agreement with ADB in December 2002. \n ", "Appendix 12  59\nhousing, children\u2019s inability to complete secondary schooling, inability to finance male household members to work in \nother Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, households with fixed incomes (including the grossly \ninadequate pensions paid to older or invalid persons), and high dependency ratios (older people or younger children). \nAmong the better-off households in the project raions are those who have been able to preserve their asset bases from \npre-independence times and have resisted pressure from local raion authorities to make investment decisions on their \nbehalf. Also among the better-off households are those such as the managers of cooperative dekhan farms who have \nbeen able to garner the assets of former collectives (i.e., land, buildings, or equipment) for their own use. Still other \nbetter-off households are those where at least one or two household members are working in other CIS countries and \ncan regularly repatriate earnings, although much of these earnings are used for household-based consumption. \n \nThe causes of poverty were generally defined as lack of water for irrigation in the valley areas (and to some extent in \nupland areas such as in Varzob) and lack of drinking water everywhere (especially during winter and summer), lack of \naccess to land whether it is household plots of private dekhan farms, and a lack of non-agricultural-based income \ngeneration opportunities. The very poor believe that if they had access to water to grow two household crops per year \ntheir food security would improve their livelihoods dramatically. Similarly, access to potable drinking water would reduce \nthe incidence of waterborne diseases and ease the burden on women and girls, who are primarily responsible for \nmanaging domestic water resources. The opportunity to become an effective private dekhan farmer\u2014defined as being \nindependent to farm freely without interference from local raion authorities\u2014also features prominently but is not \nconsidered as a realistic option by the poor. Poorer women are generally more interested in nonfarm income \ngeneration opportunities such as baking and weaving, skills that many currently possess but are unable to derive any \nincome from. For the very poor then, off-farm or nonfarm income generation opportunities are valued over farm-based \nincome generation activities. \n \nThe design of the Project addresses the major causes of poverty. Insecure or no access to arable land for the very poor \nis caused by the non-transparent and inequitable allocation of such land. The Project will include raising public \nawareness of land reform, accelerating the transition to individual farming, expediting the process of obtaining properly \nregistered land certificates, limiting local government to a reduced but more transparent role in land reform, and \nsupporting ongoing processes developed by other international donors. Pasture land tenure reform will provide the \npeople  with  an  opportunity  to  more  effectively  graze  their  livestock  on  pasture  lands,  resulting  in  significant \nimprovements in their individual livestock. \n \nPoorer  households  will  also  benefit  from  an  improved  rural  business  environment  whereby  they  will  have  the \nopportunity to finance micro and small nonfarm business enterprises within a facilitation framework with a range of \nnonfarm rural business advisory services on a fee-for-service basis (including development of business plans) and \nmarket intelligence. Rural infrastructure improvements designed to rehabilitate small-scale public infrastructure (e.g., \nroad or bridge access, irrigation and drainage systems, drinking water supplies, and electricity generation and \ndistribution) will benefit all people, including those living in poverty, and the latter will also benefit from seasonal \nemployment to make such improvements. The community infrastructure improvements will be demand-driven although \nwithin a broad context designed to improve the physical capital of the local community. Apart from being pro-poor, the \ndesign of the Project also reflects a pro-gender approach. Women will need to derive opportunities and benefits on an \nequal basis with men.  \n \nThe livelihood improvements envisaged in the project raions will benefit about 30,000 poor households, of which about \n15,000 are living in absolute poverty. Improved land tenure security will benefit about 7,000 households and generate a \n30% increase in household income. Pasture land tenure reform will allow at least 2,000 households to graze at least \n16,000 livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) on better-managed pastures, resulting in better-quality livestock. About 10% \nof poor households will be able to access and benefit from agricultural and rural business advisory services, resulting in \nthe establishment of small business enterprises and the creation of income generation opportunities for the poor. Raion \ninfrastructure development will create local paid employment for poorer beneficiaries. \n \nIndirect benefits will include increased opportunities and status for the poor, especially women and ethnic minority \ngroups where relevant, because of diminished opportunities for local raion authorities to persist with anti-poor practices \nassociated with unreasonable interference in the economic and social lives of the population, including the poor. It will \nalso be possible to address intra-household gender inequities that disempower women, by allowing the enabling \nenvironment for women\u2019s priorities to be accorded the same level of priority as those of men (e.g., community \ninfrastructure improvements). \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes                  No  \n \nA series of participatory stakeholder consultations involving women and men and ethnic minority groups were facilitated \nin a range of jamoats reflecting the different agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions of the five project raions. \nLocal jamoat and raion officials were also consulted. Secondary stakeholders included civil society groups actively \ninvolved in the project raions and for whom the Project might seek to enter into a partnership with to effect synergies \nwith existing programs or projects. These consultations also included international development partners undertaking \ntheir own projects in the project raions. With primary stakeholders at the village level, consultations focused on the \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nmeaning of poverty (its causes and effects), realistic livelihood improvements, nonfarm income generation activities, \npolitical interference from local raion authorities, problems associated with labor migration to CIS countries, and \nactivities of NGOs. With local raion authorities, the consultations related more to technical considerations such as the \nreliability of local data, problems associated with access to pasture land, assessment of NGOs, and their thoughts on \nrevisiting land allocation.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No  \n \nThe Project\u2019s participation strategy will focus on ensuring the involvement of all project beneficiaries, including the poor, \nwomen, and other vulnerable groups (including ethnic minorities), in all phases of project design, implementation, and \nmonitoring. Both participatory processes and local rural institutions that are socially inclusive (e.g., the sozmoni \nmardumi, or village organization) will be used to carry out these participatory approaches. The processes will include \n(i) participatory land allocation processes in local communities where this is deemed necessary; (ii) outreach strategies \nfor the agriculture and rural business advisory services targeted at potential clients that are sufficiently pro-poor but also \ndemand-driven; (iii) a participatory and community-based monitoring and evaluation mechanism and processes aimed \nat strengthening the pro-poor aspects of the Project; and (iv) stakeholder consultations involving local communities, \nraion authorities, relevant government agencies, independent research institutions, civil society groups, and the \ndevelopment community.  This strategy is reflected in the participation plan that has been prepared.  \n \nD.  Gender and Development \n \nIn the first few years of post-Soviet independence, large numbers of people were forced to become subsistence \nfarmers or at least rural dwellers relying on their household plots to meet basic household food security needs. The civil \nwar and the continuous seasonal male-out migration to other CIS countries contributed to women\u2019s increasing role and \nvisibility in the agricultural sector. Not only do 27% more women than men work in the agriculture sector, but women \nalso rely more for survival on produce from personal land plots (108 women for every 100 men). Women tend to \nprovide seasonal unskilled and poorly paid labor during planting and harvesting. These women receive extremely low \nwages that are often not paid regularly or are made \u201cin kind,\u201d putting further pressure on their livelihood. Women do not \nhave access to higher-paid jobs that require the operation of machinery, as this is still considered to be the men\u2019s \ndomain. Few women have formal training in the agriculture sector, but many have long experience working on \ncollective farms (sometimes in positions of responsibility) or may be highly educated, with skills from previous \nnonagricultural employment. Despite the experience women have been gaining in recent years in this sector, they are \ncommonly portrayed as unskilled agricultural workers or as contributing only unpaid family labor to household plots. In \nthe project areas, critical issues affecting the status of women as identified by women include: (i) lack of access to \ncheap inputs for improving the productivity of their household plots; (ii) limited opportunities to secure access to private \ndekhan farms; (iii) disproportionate representation as members of largely nonperforming cooperative dekhan farms; \n(iv) pivotal role in food production because of the absence of adult males, who are working in CIS countries; (v) lack of \naccess to livestock for the very poor; (vi) lack of access to off-farm income generation activities; (vii) lack of access to \naffordable sources of credit; and (viii) lack of free time compared with men, because of the need to juggle household \nactivities with food production and other income generation activities. \n \nDuring project preparation, a detailed social and gender analysis was carried out by the TA consultants. On the basis of \nthe potential gender impact of the Project, a Project-specific gender action plan has been developed, through \nconsultations at the central and raion level, to ensure the equal participation of male and female stakeholders as agents \nand beneficiaries in the proposed loan. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Background \n \n1.  The Rural Development Project will improve the living standards of rural communities in \nthe project raions by improving land tenure security for individual households, carrying out a \nseries  of  rural  development  initiatives  associated  with  both  farm  and  nonfarm  business \ndevelopment,  instituting  more  rational  use  of  pasture  lands,  providing  easier  access  to \nmicrocredit, and implementing small infrastructure improvements of a demand-driven nature. To \nachieve all this, the Project has four main components: (i) policy and institutional development \nand reform; (ii) sustainable land management (pasture, arable, and forest);  (iii) agricultural and \nrural business support; (iv) rural infrastructure development; and (v) project management. \n \n2.  The rehabilitation and improvement of small-scale irrigation and drainage systems, rural \nwater supply systems, and intra-raion roads in the Project will have potentially very limited \ninvoluntary resettlement impact. However, because all small-scale infrastructure improvements \nin the raions and the communities are fully demand-driven, safeguards must be provided for \neven limited involuntary resettlement impact via this resettlement framework. \n \n3.  All  land  in  Tajikistan  is  state-owned  and  the  Land  Code  states  that  land  must  be \neffectively used to the benefit of the people (article 2 of the Land Code). Land use is directed by \nthe State through the local raion administrations, specifically the local offices of the State \nCommittee  for  Land  Management  and  raion  administrative  offices  (hukumat),  although  an \nunderlying objective of the Project is to ensure that land use (especially what is cultivated) is a \ndecision of individual landholders rather than the State. Inheritance land-use rights are provided \nfor in the Constitution (article 13) and the Land Code (article 12), but the process is still at a very \nearly stage of implementation and does not provide women with rights and opportunities for \ninheritance or reimbursement of land share when getting married or divorced. The Land Code \naddresses potential compensation for people who legally occupy government land and are \nforced to relocate (article 15) but does not address compensation for people illegally occupying \ngovernment land and forced to relocate, nor does it address compensation for people who have \nentered into \u201cinformal\u201d renting or leasing arrangements with legally recognized land certificates. \n \n4.  A number of raion infrastructure projects that will benefit agriculture were identified for \nfinancing under the Project. These include minor rehabilitation of irrigation systems, and the \nrehabilitation  of  jamoat-to-raion  roads.  Community  infrastructure  projects  that  have  been \nidentified  include  water  supply  system  (one  of  which  is  gravity-fed  and  transects  several \ndifferent local communities), a prototype veterinary clinic, and a typical vegetable market. Pre-\nfeasibility studies have not been carried out on any of these proposed projects, and at this stage \nit is not possible to state with absolute certainty that there will not be any resettlement issues. \nHowever, no major resettlement issues are expected, although the minor rehabilitation works on \nirrigation systems could affect the people who now use the land within 5 meters of the irrigation \ncanal (they are permitted to do so on the understanding that the land will revert to the irrigation \nsystem). \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n5.  The pre-identified infrastructure projects in the raions and communities do not involve \nland acquisition or resettlement. However, in the light of the land acquisition and resettlement \npractices of some raion authorities in the past, affected households must be given adequate \ncompensation for loss of cultivated land or of housing as a result of the Project. \n ", "Appendix 13  63\nC.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n \n6.  The Tajikistan Land Code (article 48) states that if land is taken from a physical and \njuridical or legal person for state and public needs, those persons will be apportioned the same \nvalue of land, and losses, including income, will be fully compensated. During the preparation of \nthe  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project  technical  assistance  (TA)  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the chief of the Department of International Relations at Tajikistan\u2019s \nState Committee for Land Management stated that the local raion authorities could compensate \npeople who are forced to relocate, but only for loss of cultivated land (pasture land was not \nmentioned, but relocation is assumed not to take place outside the village) and not for the loss \nof housing or other built structures. The short resettlement plan prepared as part of that TA was \nthe result of extensive discussions with local raion authorities to clarify this matter. Similarly \nunder  the  TA  for  the  Project,  extensive  discussions  were  undertaken  with  the  local  raion \nauthorities in each of the five project raions. In the most unlikely event that households lose land \nor are forced to relocate, the households will receive full and complete compensation. \n \n7.  The ADB Policy on Involuntary Resettlement addresses \u201closses of land, resources, and \nmeans of livelihood or social support systems, which people suffer as a result of ADB projects.\u201d \nThe Project is unlikely to cause any population displacement, but a few households, especially \namong  those  with  no  access  to  other  sources  of  land  (at  present  approximately  90%  of \nhouseholds are in this category), might lose access to a portion of the land from which they \nderive a very important source of their livelihood. This is a global estimate, however, and \nobviously none of the infrastructure projects will affect this number of households. Nevertheless, \nthe resettlement framework ensures that those whose lives and incomes may be affected will be \nassisted to ensure that they have at least the same (but ideally, better) level of material well-\nbeing after the Project as they did before it. \n \nD.  Consultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n \n8.  Because affected people have not been identified, there have been no discussions with \nsuch people. However, the TA team held discussions with people who have been affected by \nthe resettlement practices of local raion authorities in Varzob, with local people likely to be \naffected by attempts at resettlement by local raion authorities in Faizobod, and people who will \nbe affected by hydropower dam construction in Rogun. The Project will need to learn from such \nlessons  and  avoid  repeating  any  mistakes.  Discussions  were  also  held  with  local  raion \nauthorities in the five project raions and at the national level with the State Committee for Land \nManagement and the Ministry of Agriculture in Dushanbe. \n \n9.  All parties to the discussions have agreed in principle to ensure the welfare of any \npotentially-affected households. Local raion authorities in the five project raions will address the \nappeals of any persons affected by raion infrastructure development projects. It has been \nagreed that affected persons may appoint a mediator or facilitator, who will be paid by local \nraion authorities, to mediate or facilitate on their behalf. Moreover, the project management unit \n(PMU) will have the services of a gender and social development specialist, who will ensure that \nany people who are affected are compensated according to the principles of this resettlement \nframework. \n \nE.  Compensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n \n10.  There  are  three  key  elements  related  to  compensation,  relocation,  and  income \nrestoration. First, local raion authorities have agreed to provide land of equal or better quality, in \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \ncompensation for their potential loss of livelihood. Second, local raion authorities have agreed \nthat during the construction of infrastructure projects, affected people will be accorded priority in \nemployment where possible. However, the local raion authorities are not in a position to offer \nfuture employment to affected people and argue that income restoration will need to be linked to \nthe provision of land of equal or better quality. It is, of course, the stated preference of the five \nraion authorities to avoid loss of land. \n \n11.  The five raion authorities have stated that they do not wish to invest in infrastructure \ndevelopment projects leading to housing relocation. To this end, they have instructed or will \ninstruct technical specialists to design projects in such a way that housing relocation will not be \nnecessary. At the local community level, local communities will be informed that infrastructure \ndevelopment projects must not result in the loss of land or the relocation of houses unless \nindividual households (and all adult household members) agree to the acquisition of a portion of \ntheir land or house, or the relocation of other built structures (e.g., hay barn or cattle shed). \nWhere such loss of land or relocation of houses or other built structures occurs, the same \nprinciples in relation to compensation, relocation, and income restoration will need to apply. \n \nF.  Institutional Framework \n \n12.  Planning,  implementation,  inspection,  and  assessment  for  raion  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects will be the joint responsibility of the local raion authorities and the PMU in \nconsultation with jamoat and community-based groups. The PMU would also provide oversight \nof the implementation of the resettlement framework. Dissemination of information and any \nnecessary public discussions with affected people would also be undertaken periodically to \nensure proper implementation of the resettlement framework. Before local communities call for \nproposals for infrastructure development projects to be financed by the Project, information \nabout this resettlement framework will be disseminated by the PMU. Resettlement plans will be \nprepared according to the resettlement framework.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n13.  For  households  that  lose  access  to  land  because  of  raion  investments,  local raion \nauthorities need to ensure that replacement land will be provided and that households will \nreceive land-use rights on this land. Households in a similar position as a result of community \ninfrastructure investments will need to be provided with replacement land and receive land-use \nrights. Because local raion authorities are responsible for issuing land-use rights certificates, \nthey will also need to be involved. There will be minor costs involved in monitoring and providing \nsupport for resettlement, and these costs, as well as any unforeseen costs, will be covered by \nthe Project. \n \nH.  Implementation Schedule \n \n14.  Any detailed planning and implementation of resettlement would take place well before \nthe start of civil works construction. According to the Project Implementation Schedule, activities \nassociated with the first tranche for the improvements in raion and community infrastructure are \nscheduled to begin in 2007. Subject to project conditions being met, the second tranche will be \nreleased in 2009 and the third in 2011. Each cycle of infrastructure improvement projects is \nexpected to take about 2 years. \n \n ", "Appendix 13  65\nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n15.  The PMU will implement a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan for the entire Project, \nincluding preparation, implementation, and flow-on effects. In relation to resettlement, the PMU \nwill develop baseline data for monitoring indicators including: amount of land lost; amount of \nreplacement  land  (of  similar  or  better  quality);  number  of  jobs  provided  (temporary  and \nreplacement); compensation payments; and other assistance in moving, training, and household \nincome (or agricultural income or output value) tracking. In support of these activities, affected \npersons will be invited to attend public meetings to discuss resettlement issues. The Executing \nAgency  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement framework and a resettlement completion report. \n \nJ.  Conclusion \n \n16.  The Project should avoid any investment activities that would require a resettlement \nplan.  However,  realistically  it  is  impossible  to  preempt  demand-driven  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects, whether at the raion or at the local community level. Therefore, the \nresettlement  framework  has  been  designed  to  provide  safeguards  where  demand-driven \ninfrastructure development projects do result in some degree of resettlement, because affected \npeople should not see a diminution in their living standards as a result of investments that are \ndesigned to benefit as many beneficiaries as possible in the Project. \n \n ", "66  Appendix 14 \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \nGender-Relevant Activities \n1. Policy and Institutional Development and Reform \n\u2022  Gender and development issues will be pursued through the inclusion of gender-related aspects in \ndialogue with the central Government and local raion authorities, stakeholder meetings, and other forums \ninitiated during the Project. \n\u2022  All women with a land allocation will have land-use rights certificates. \n\u2022  Legal awareness programs for raion officials explicitly recognize women\u2019s greater exposure and \nvulnerability to the unequal and non-transparent allocation of land during land reform. \n\u2022  Up to 50% of beneficiaries will participate in legal literacy and aid initiatives aimed at strengthening the \nknowledge of local communities on Land Code\u2013related rules, processes and institutions at the raion and \njamoat level. \n\u2022  At least 15% of individuals identified for the survey of recent or current practices in land registration in the \nproject area will be women. \n \n2.  Sustainable Land Management (Pasture, Arable, and Forest) Improvement \n\u2022  Pro-gender approaches will be introduced into policy development associated with pasture, arable, and \nforest land improvement and improvements in the rural business environment. \n\u2022  The gender and development approach will be incorporated into curricula on pasture land management. \n\u2022  Up to 50% of participants in training for farm-level planning and management of pasture land\u2013based \nlivestock production systems will be women. \n \n3. Agriculture and Rural Business Support \n\u2022  Agricultural and rural business advisory centers will be staffed with a social development and gender \nspecialist to ensure outreach to rural women. \n\u2022  The advisory centers will set a realistic annual target for outreach to women clients (dekhan farmers, \nhouseholds, and rural businesses) based on the situation in each raion. \n\u2022  The advisory centers will target business planning for farm and nonfarm enterprise development \nappropriate to women\u2019s interest and needs.  \n\u2022  Participatory technology development methodologies will be gender-sensitive. \n\u2022  Up to 50% of formal and informal training-of-trainer programs will be participated in and facilitated by \nwomen. \n\u2022  Up to 50% of the certified holistic management practitioners will be women. \n\u2022  Field visits will be structured to accommodate the specific needs of women.  \n \n4. Rural Infrastructure Development  \n\u2022  Up to 50% of participants in community-based groups and stakeholder consultations to identify local needs \nand prioritize possible investments will be women. \n\u2022  Information for all public consultations will be made available to women at convenient times and locations.  \n\u2022  Female community facilitators will be employed to support public consultation and development of local \nmaintenance units or user groups. \n\u2022  A 30% quota target will be adopted for women\u2019s membership and leadership in local maintenance units or \nuser groups. \n \n5. Project Management  \n\u2022  A gender and social development specialist will be employed by the Project Management Unit. \n\u2022  The project monitoring system will include a feedback mechanism to provide project staff with gender-\ndisaggregated data and assessments. \n \nNote:  The indicators and targets will be reviewed following the completion of the baseline survey to be conducted \nwithin the first 6 months of the Project. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070131161442+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061219083539+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Main text, 12Dec06.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Author": "Nsd", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
