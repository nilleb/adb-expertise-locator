The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n \nThe  Project  takes  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  to  rural \ndevelopment  to  address  problems  and  constraints,  enhance \nopportunities,  and  integrate  agriculture  more  effectively  into  the \nrural  economy.  The  Project  will  focus  on  five  contiguous  raions \n(districts)\u2014Faizabad,  Rogun,  Rudaki,  Vahdat,  and  Varzob\u2014\nlocated around the capital, Dushanbe. \n \nThe Project will (i) address land use security; (ii) develop policies \nand  strategy  for  more  effective  pasture  land  management  and \nthe  administration  and \ncapacity  development;  (iii) \ninstitutional  aspects  of  business  development;  (iv)  address  the \ncapacity and technical aspects of degradation of arable, pasture, \nand  forest  lands;  (v)  establish  independent  agriculture  and  rural \nbusiness  advisory  services;  (vi)  establish  an  effective  market \ninformation  system;  (vii)  provide  microcredit;  and  (viii)  improve \nrural infrastructure in communities and raions. \n \nis \nWhile  agriculture \nunderperforming  and  therefore  not  contributing  significantly  to \nrural development and overall poverty reduction in rural areas. As \nfarmers emerge from a primarily subsistence-based agriculture, in \nthe transition to a market-oriented economy, agriculture still has a \nfundamental  role  in  fostering  rural  economic  growth  and  in \ndiversifying and developing the rural nonfarm economy. Inclusive \nrural  development  requires  high  overall  economic  growth; \neffective land reform; adequate support services; the development \nof  economic  and  social  infrastructure;  efficient  and  effective \ninstitutions;  access \nfinancial  services;  a  dynamic \nagriculture sector, including attention to new technology, research, \nand  the  conservation  of  natural  resources;  and  the  development \nof rural nonfarm enterprises.  \n \nAt  present,  the  key  constraints  to  rural  development  in  Tajikistan \nare: the limited freedom to farm and conduct business; the limited \navailability  of  support  services;  poor  infrastructure;  severe  land \ndegradation; and weak institutions. Such weaknesses need to be \naddressed, not independently of one another, but in an integrated, \n\nis  contributing \n\nthe  economy, \n\nto  rural \n\nto \n\nit \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nto  enhance \n\nthe  development  effectiveness  of \n\ninput  supply,  agro-processing,  and  marketing \n\ncoordinated,  and  sustainable  manner.  In  addition,  there  are \npersistent  gender-based  discriminatory  practices,  which  affect \nwomen\u2019s  equal  access  to  resources,  services,  and  opportunities. \nThe  Project  will  address  all  aspects  of  agriculture,  from  land  use \nsecurity, \nto \nenterprise  and  capacity  development,  to  bring  farmers  out  of \nsubsistence  production  to  commercial  farming,  and  develop \nrelated  farm  and  nonfarm  enterprises.  It  will  do  all  this  with  a \ngender  and  development  focus  and  within  an  environmentally \nsustainable management framework. \n \nThe  proposed  area-focused  approach  will  enable  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  to \nstrengthen  and  coordinate  the  development  activities  in  the  five \nraions \nthe \nassistance.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  supported  with  grant \nassistance  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility,  under  the \nCentral Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management. \n \nThe  grant  component  of  the  Project  will  develop  awareness  of \nland and business rights; develop a modern curriculum for pasture \nland management and train associated staff; develop the capacity \nof  raions  to  plan  and  maintain  infrastructure;  and  procure \nconsultants and equipment for project management. \n \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  farm  and  nonfarm  incomes  of  rural \nhouseholds. As a result of the Project, farms and rural enterprises \nin Faizabod, Rudaki, Rogun, Vahdat, and Varzob are expected to \nbecome more productive and profitable within an environmentally \nsustainable management framework. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $23.3  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.3 million. ADB will finance $17.1 \nfrom  Asian \nmillion \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  sources  and  $8.3  million  with  an \nADF IX grant. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) will finance \n$3.5 million equivalent, the Government, $1.65 million equivalent, \nand beneficiaries, $1.05 million equivalent.  \n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 5.92 million ($8.8 \nmillion) from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources will be provided. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan  interest  rate  of  1%  yearly  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nyearly thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set \nforth in the Financing Agreement. The loan will meet the costs of \nthe  infrastructure  development,  microfinance,  and  office  and \nequipment  requirements.  The  ADF  IX  grant  of  $8.3  million  will \nfinance  international  and  national  consultants,  agricultural  and \nrural  business  advisory  staff  and  services,  equipment,  vehicles, \ntraining,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  GEF  grant,  if \napproved, will meet the costs of the implementation of the pasture \nland  sector  assessment  recommendations,  the  rehabilitation  of \nlands,  consulting  services,  and  equipment.  The \ndegraded \n\nequivalent\u2014$8.8  million \n\nequivalent \n\n\f  v\n\nGovernment  will  finance  taxes  and  duties,  counterpart  staff,  and \nthe  services  of  the  course  coordinator  for  the  pasture  land \ncurricula development and teacher training. The beneficiaries will \nfinance their contribution for the community infrastructure and part \nof their credit requirements. \n \nThe loan funds will be provided by the Government to the raions \nas  a  grant,  except  for  a  $4.0  million  equivalent  credit  line  to  be \nmade  available  to  borrowers  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF) \nthrough  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs).  MOF  will  onlend  the \nfunds  in  somoni  or  Dollars.  Somoni  loans  will  be  at  75%  of  the \nNational Bank of Tajikistan (NBKR) interbank interest rate. Dollar \nloans  will  be  at  floating  rate  based  on  the  6-month  LIBOR  for \nDollars.  The  MFIs  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and  will \nrelend \nloan  agreements \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nUntil 30 September 2014 \n \n31 March 2014 \n\nto  subborrowers  under  separate \n\n \nA project steering committee (PSC) will be created, the Ministry of \nAgriculture  (MOA)  will  serve  as  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and \nthe  State  Committee  on  Land  Management  (SCLM)  as  the \nImplementing Agency (IA), and a project management unit (PMU). \nVarious  activities  of  the  Project  will  be  contracted  out  to \nnongovernment organizations and other local service providers. \n \nMinistry of Agriculture  \n \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  2,260  person-months  of  consulting \nservices, to be provided by international (184 person-months) and \nnational  consultants  (2,076  person-months).  The  consultants  will \nbe  selected  under  separate  consulting-firm  contracts  for:  pasture \nland  sector  assessment  and  implementation;  the  development  of \ncurricula  and  capacity  in  pasture  land  management  at  an \neducational  institution;  agriculture  and  rural  business  advisory \nservices;  the  establishment  of  a  market  information  system;  and \nproject  management.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  according \nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  selection  will  be  based  on  full \ntechnical proposals and quality for the first two contracts, and on \nquality and cost for the other three contracts.  \n \nWithout  the  Project,  there  will  continue  to  be  low  incomes  and \nhigh rates of rural poverty because of very low crop and livestock \nyields  and  an  environment  that  is  not  conducive  to  commercial \nfarming,  agribusiness,  and  rural  enterprises.

The  productivity  increases \nare  further  expected  to  increase  per  capita  income  from  an \naverage of TJS200 ($60) to TJS580 ($170) for rainfed crop farms \nand to TJS804 ($237) for irrigated farms. \n \nSecure  land  use  and  proper  pasture  land  management,  together \nwith  the  necessary  support  services,  can  realistically  increase \nannual milk production by at least 50%; the total number of calves \nreared  by  100%;  lambing  percentages  by  100%;  and  kidding \npercentages to 150%. These improvements will allow the 35,000 \nor so farm families that currently have livestock in the project area \nto increase their incomes and assets significantly.  \n \nRural  business  development  will  generate  significant  benefits  by \nsupporting  profitable  agricultural  processing  and  other  rural \nenterprises.  The  rural  infrastructure,  prioritized  by  the  local \ninfrastructure \ncommunities,  will \nconstraints.  Indicative  models  of  rural  water  supply  and  irrigation \nsubprojects show benefits in excess of the costs involved. \n \nThe Project-wide economic analysis, excluding rural infrastructure \ncomponent,  shows  the  Project  generating  an  economic  rate  of \nreturn  of  18%.    The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  stable  rates  of \nreturn. \n \nThe  Project  will  bring  social  benefits,  particularly  for  poorer \nbeneficiaries, through improvements in land use security, the rural \nbusiness  environment,  access \nlivelihood \nactivities. \n \nNo significant negative environmental impact is likely. The Project \nis  likely  to  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  soil  and  water \ncondition, \nresources, \nagricultural development, institutional development, public health, \nand  social  capital.  To  support  effective  project  implementation,  a \nresettlement framework, a participation plan, a gender action plan, \nand specific actions for ethnic minorities have been prepared. \n \n\nproductivity,  watershed \n\nto  pastures,  and \n\ngrassland \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  While  the  expected  benefits  are  promising,  there  are  some  risks \nattached  to  the  Project.  The  success  of  market-oriented  private \n\n\f  vii\n\nfarming  and  agribusiness  depends  heavily  on  secure  land  use \nrights  for  farmers  and  an  enabling  business  environment.  The \nProject  will  attempt  to  reduce  these  risks  by  engaging  in \ncontinuous  dialogue  with  higher \nlevels  of  government  and \nproviding  the  necessary  training  and  capacity  development  to \nfarmers  and  local  government  officials,  to  facilitate  the  reform \nprocess. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  is  a  combination  of  investments,  policy  reforms, \ntechnical  and \ncapacity  development,  and  dissemination  of \nbusiness-related  knowledge.  The  knowledge  and  capacity \ndevelopment components, generally, have much higher multiplier \nimpact,  but  the  benefits  are  long-term  and  mostly  intangible. \ninvestment  components,  particularly \nThere \ninfrastructure  components,  may  assume  a  prominent  role  in  the \nProject  and  take  resources  away  from  the  policy,  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  knowledge  components.  The  Project  will \naddress this risk by setting a cap on the infrastructure component. \n\nis  a \n\nthat \n\nrisk \n\nthese \n\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  Capacity  Building \n\nThe development partner community has noted corruption, fraud, \nand  abuse  of  funds  in  previous  and  current  projects.  ADB  will \nissues  by  ensuring  proper  accounting  and \naddress \nprocurement  staffing  of  the  PMU.  In  addition,  an  independent \naudit  of  accounts  will  be  conducted  by  a  certified  and  reputable \nauditing firm to reduce the risk of misuse of ADB funds. \n \nThe \nfor  Local \nGovernment will improve economic and social development in the \nfive  raions  of  Faizabod,  Rogum,  Rudaki,  Vardat,  and  Varzob. \nCapacity for economic and social planning is expected to improve \nas a result. A grant of $600,000, to be provided by ADB through \nits  TA  funding  program,  will  finance  the  services  of  international \n(12  person-months)  and  national  consultants  (108  person-\nmonths).

This  report  is  based  on  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  feasibility  study,  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with \ngovernment  officials,  other  development  partners,  civil  society,  and  beneficiaries.  The  project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nTajikistan  is  a  small,  mountainous,  landlocked  country,  whose  geographic  location  and \nhistory present formidable barriers to sustainable growth and development. Of the total area of \n14.3 million hectares (ha), 30% is agricultural land, comprising pasture land (82%), arable land \n(16%),  and  perennial  crops  (2%).  The  total  irrigated  area  of  about  732,000  ha  serves \n504,000 ha of arable land, 122,600 ha of household plots, 79,500 ha of orchards and vineyards, \nand  25,900  ha  for  other  uses.  The  main  irrigated  crops  are  cotton,  grains  (wheat  and  corn), \nfruits, and vegetables. About 46% of the total irrigated land is served by pumped systems. \n \n4. \nTajikistan  has  a  narrow  economic  base,  with  agriculture  providing  the  major  source  of \nlivelihood  for  more  than  64%  of  the  population.  Agriculture  is  particularly  important  for  the \neconomy, contributing about 24% of gross domestic product (GDP),3 66% of employment, 26% \nof exports, and 39% of tax revenue. Rural poverty incidence declined from 83% in 1999 to 64% \nin 2003.4  \n \n5. \nCrop production, which accounts for 74% of agricultural output, is dominated by cotton. \nCrop  yields  have  increased  substantially  since  1998,  although  they  remain  extremely  low  by \nregional  and  international  standards.  Crop  production  has  grown  significantly  faster  than \nlivestock  production,  accounting  for  80%  of  sector  growth  from  1999  to  2003.  Livestock \nownership  has  shifted  to  households,  which  own  about  90%  of  all  livestock  but  control  about \n10% of the cultivated area for fodder and less than 1% of pastures. Meat and milk production is \nlow, largely because of low fertility and poor nutrition. Access to pastures is limited and animals \ngraze  near  settlements,  causing  overgrazing  and  environmental  damage.  More  than  70%  of \nhorticultural  output  (about  1.0  million  tons  of  fruit  and  vegetables)  is  produced  on  household \nplots. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2004.

IMF Executive Board Conclusions Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Tajikistan). \n\n4  Despite substantial progress, Tajikistan remains deeply poor: official GDP in 2004 was $311 per capita.  The most \nvulnerable  people  affected  are  female-headed  households,  children,  the  disabled,  and  those  living  in  remote  or \ndisaster-prone areas. \n\n\f 2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nLand  is  managed  as  large  state  and  collective  farms,5 collective  dekhan  farms,  private \n6. \ndekhan  farms,  and  household  plots.  The  average  size  of  household  plots  is  0.2  ha,  dekhan \nfarms  (including  collective  dekhan  farms)  21  ha,  and  state  and  collective  farms  213  ha. \nHowever, household plots contributed 51%, dekhan farms 37%, and state and collective farms \n12% to agricultural growth from 1999 to 2003.   \n \n7. \nAgricultural processing of crops and livestock remains limited. Processing equipment is \noutdated,  facilities  are  large  and  have  overcapacity,  and  there  is  an  increasing  trend  toward \nsmaller-scale  processing.  Livestock  processing  plants  have  been  privatized  but  operate  at  a \nfraction of their installed capacity, often in unsanitary conditions, and with obsolete equipment. \n \nB. \n \nWhile agriculture has contributed significantly to economic growth and poverty reduction \n8. \nsince  1997,  it  is  still  underperforming,  and  has  considerable  potential  to  contribute  further  to \neconomic  growth,  rural  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  exports.  Tajikistan  is  still \nundergoing  transition  to  a  market-oriented  economy,  and  as  farmers  emerge  from  a  primarily \nsubsistence-based  farming  agriculture  still  has  a  fundamental  role  in  fostering  rural  economic \ngrowth  and  in  diversifying  and  developing  the  rural  nonfarm  economy.  A  recent  paper 6 \nsummarized the major drivers of inclusive rural development as follows: high overall economic \ngrowth;  effective  land  reform;  adequate  support  services;  the  development  of  economic  and \nsocial  infrastructure;  efficient  and  effective  institutions;  access  to  rural  financial  services;  a \ndynamic  agriculture  sector, \nthe \nconservation of natural resources; and the development of rural nonfarm enterprises.    \n \nThe key constraints on rural development in Tajikistan are: the limited freedom to farm \n9. \nand conduct business; severe land degradation; the limited availability of support services; poor \ninfrastructure; and weak institutions. \n \nFarmers  and  business  entrepreneurs  have  limited  freedom  because  of  the  restrictive \n10. \nenabling environment, largely at the raion (district) level. Most people have not been adequately \ninformed of their land use rights. Some are dissatisfied with the allocation and demarcation of \nland  parcels:  at  present  the  local  raion  authorities  can  take  and  reallocate  land  if  its  use  is \ndeemed  improper  or  irrational.  Similarly,  rural  businesses  must  endure  the  unpredictable \nbehavior  of  local  officials,  primarily  caused  by  differing  interpretations  of  legislation  and \nregulations,  and  the  officials\u2019  lack  of  knowledge.  This  environment  creates  a  high  degree  of \ninsecurity among the people with respect to land use and business rights and discourages them \nfrom investing in land, farming, or developing commercial business. A more favorable farm and \nbusiness  environment  is  essential  for  land  use  security,  investments  in  land  and  farming,  and \ninvestments  in  small  and  medium  enterprises  that  will  deliver  input  supplies,  rural  services, \nstorage,  processing,  equipment  dealerships,  financial  services,  and  other  activities  in  an \nemerging market economy. \n \n11. \nExtensive  land  degradation  is  evident.  Irrigation-related  land  degradation,  in  particular \nsecondary  salinity,  waterlogging,  and  soil  erosion,  has  left  about  90,000  ha  in  poor  condition. \nSoil erosion in rainfed farmlands stems largely from the cultivation of wheat on sloping pastures. \nIn  addition,  overgrazing  near  settlements,  the  abandonment  of  pastures  at  higher  elevations, \nand  the  unmanaged  collection  of  fuelwood  have  seriously  degraded  pasture  and  forest  land. \nSome  land  management  practices,  including  an  absence  of  soil  conservation  measures  and \n\ntechnology,  research,  and \n\nincluding  attention \n\nto  new \n\n                                                 \n5   These farms are gradually being restructured into cooperative and private dekhan farms.  \n6   Fernando, Nimal. 2006.

ADB. \n\n\f  3\n\npoor  pasture  management,  reflect  a  lack  of  knowledge,  as  many  farmers  have  limited \nagricultural training and experience.  \n \n12. \nFarmers and rural businesses are disempowered by the lack of professional agriculture \nand  business  support  services.  Limited  services  are  being  provided  by  a  number  of \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  institutes.  Better  services  must  be  provided  in  a \nflexible  manner  to  meet  the  needs  of  farmers  without  generating  the  high  overhead  costs \nassociated with formal institutional arrangements, and without requiring an increase in recurrent \ngovernment expenditure.  \n \n13. \nThe  limited  availability  of  and  access  to  micro  and  rural  finance  severely  constrains \nagriculture  and  rural  business  development.  While  working  capital  is  provided  by  commercial \nbanks  and  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  investment  finance  is  generally  not  available.  The \nagricultural non-cotton lending of commercial banks was TJS91 million ($26.9 million) at the end \nof 2005\u2014about 7% of their lending portfolio. The banks provided agricultural loans ranging from \n$2,400 to $114,000, for an average loan size of about $10,000. Demand for microcredit is high \nand  doubling  about  every  2  years.  Microcredit  loans  in  2005  totaled  TJS296  million  ($87.5 \nmillion) and had an average size of TJS5,380 ($1,590).  \n \n14.  Market information, which farmers and business entrepreneurs need to make decisions, \nis not timely, often irregular, and not available to a wide audience. There is a need for a network \nthat  will  collect,  analyze,  and  disseminate  market  information  in  a  form  that  can  be  used  by \nadvisers, farmers, and entrepreneurs. \n \n15. \nEconomic infrastructure is generally in a state of disrepair. Roads and bridges must be \nrehabilitated  to  provide  better  and  more  reliable  access  to  markets  and  services,  irrigation \nsystems  need  major  repair,  drinking  water  is  often  inaccessible,  and  electricity  supply  is \nconstantly  disrupted,  particularly  in  winter.  Planning  and  maintenance  capacity  in  raions  and \njamoats  (groups  of  villages)  is  very  weak,  as  reflected  in  the  absence  of  subsector-specific \ndevelopment and maintenance plans and associated funding. \n  \n16. \nNational  and  local  institutions  are  weak.  All  central  government  institutions  are \nhampered by the lack of financial resources: their budgets are insufficient to cover much more \nthan  salaries.  Raions  and  jamoats  have  similar  difficulties.  Skills  in  planning  are  lacking, \nparticularly where interrelationships between different parts of the economy are involved,. There \nis no clear accountability for performance, and controls on performance depend on the way the \nindividual  raion  governors  perceive  the  results.  The  budgeting  process  does  not  allow  for \nlonger-term financial planning. \n \n17. \nDespite government policies aimed at increasing the involvement of the people in local \ngovernment planning and management, central and local government is still mostly top-down. In \naddition,  the  weak  enabling  environment  limits  the  capacity  of  the  private  sector  to  provide \nessential support services to agriculture and rural businesses. \n \n18.  With widows having increased in number following the civil war, and males migrating to \nRussia  and  other  countries  for  permanent  or  seasonal  employment,  households  headed  by \nwomen  are  increasing  and  women  in  Tajikistan  are  taking  on  more  livelihood  responsibilities. \nBut the employment and income-earning opportunities of women are meager. Besides having to \nearn an income and provide for the household, they must care for their children. In agriculture, \nwomen look after household plots, trade some produce, raise and trade livestock, and work as \nlaborers  on  collective  dekhan  farms,  where  they  are  paid  less  than  half  of  what  the  male \nworkers  receive.  There  are  also  gender  differences  in  access  to  land,  particularly  in  the \nownership of private dekhan farms, and education. \n \n\n\f 4 \n\n19. \nThe national and rural development strategies of the Government are guided by: (i) the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  for  Tajikistan,  1999\u20132015;  (ii)  the  Medium-Term  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy,  2006\u20132008;  and  (iii)  the  National  Development  Strategy  for  2006\u20132015. \nThe  specific  strategy  for  the  development  of  the  agricultural  sector  is  the  draft  Food  Security \nand Agro-Industrial Complex Development Strategy, 2006\u20132015.  \n \n20. \nThe  Food  Security  and  Agro-Industrial  Complex  Development  Strategy  of  April  2006 \nidentifies  the  following  problems:  (i)  unclear  roles  of  government  and  the  private  sector  in \nagricultural development; (ii) insecure land use rights and a lack of freedom in production and \nmarketing  decisions;  (iii)  inconsistent  local  interpretations  of  land  rights  and  limits  on \nentrepreneurial decision making; (iv) limited access to credit; (v) lack of agricultural machinery; \n(vi)  underdeveloped  agriculture  infrastructure  and  markets;  (vii)  deteriorating  irrigation  and \ndrainage systems; (viii) low farm labor productivity; (ix) poor state regulation and sector support, \noften  due  to  administrative  interference;  (x)  a  shift  from  high-value  commercial  crops  to  less \nvaluable grains and a significant reduction in fodder crops; (xi) deteriorating quality of livestock \nherds;  and  (xii)  increasing  outbreaks  of  animal  diseases.  The  Strategy  proposes  the  following \nkey  measures:  (i)  improving  land  legislation  and  ownership;  (ii)  clarifying  the  role  of  local \nauthorities in land reform; (iii) giving farmers greater freedom of choice; (iv) reducing cotton debt \nin  the  medium  term  by  improving  access  to  capital  and  increasing  the  significance  of  Tajik \ncotton on the world market;7 (v) increasing the rate of reform in the sector by introducing further \ninstitutional  reform  and  reducing  interference  in  production  decisions  at  the  local  level;  and \n(vi) improving productivity by rehabilitating irrigation and drainage systems, encouraging the use \nof  improved  farming  techniques,  and  increasing  marketing  awareness.  However,  limited \ninstitutional  capacity  and  lack  of  funding  make  it  difficult  to  implement  these  measures  and  to \nprogress toward the stated objectives.  \n \n21. \nDevelopment  assistance  in  agriculture  and  rural  development  is  generally  increasing, \nparticularly from international donors and NGOs. The number of agencies and the scope of their \nactivities in Tajikistan have expanded in recent years.8 The main agencies are the World Bank, \nthe  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  the \nEuropean Union, the Aga Khan Foundation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations,  and  bilateral  agencies:  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID),  the  Government  of  Germany,  the  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation \n(SDC),  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Agency,  and  NGOs.  NGOs  are  moving  away  from  humanitarian  to \ndevelopment  assistance  in  agriculture,  microcredit,  social  services,  and  other  related  areas  in \nrural  development.  The  combined  efforts  of  these  agencies  are  helping  the  Government \naddress  the  challenges  discussed  above.  There  is  increasing  cooperation  and  cofinancing  of \ndevelopment activities. See Appendix 3 for further information about external assistance. \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  agriculture,  natural  resources,  and  rural  development  has  focused \non emergency assistance; rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation, especially in cotton-growing \nareas;  water  supply;  cotton  debt  assessment;  and  related  institutional  developments.  ADB\u2019s \ncurrent  country  strategy  emphasizes  rural  development  as  a  key  priority  in  creating  a  better \nenvironment for more inclusive growth; increased productivity and profitability in the rural sector; \n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2006.

The UNDP lists 11 UN \norganizations,  5  international  financial  institutions,  13  international  organizations,  and  27  international  NGOs \nregistered  in  the  country,  as  well  as  some  embassies  that  are  active  in  development.  The  Government\u2019s  Aid \nCoordination Unit states that in 2005 there were 63 development partners in the country, including 39  working in \ngovernment administration and 30 in agriculture and irrigation. According to the Unit, there are 94 ongoing projects \nin  the  agriculture  sector  throughout  Tajikistan,  and  a  further  81  are  ongoing,  although  past  their  scheduled \ncompletion date.  \n\n\f  5\n\ninstitution building to strengthen policy implementation and encourage private sector activities; \nand improvements in infrastructure (irrigation and transport).  \n \nLessons.  According  to  the  2006  Annual  Evaluation  Review, 9 the  project  success  in \n23. \ncategory A countries from 1990 to 1997 was 74%, better than in category B countries and the \naverage performance overall. Among the countries that did well were the transition economies. \nOn the other hand, agriculture projects had the worst outcomes for projects financed out of the \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)\u2014only  47%  were  rated  successful  overall\u2014although  the \nsuccess  rate  for  irrigation  and  rural  development  projects  exceeded  50%.  The  main  problems \nwere:  (i)  inadequate  project  design,  including  inadequate  understanding  of  the  problems  and \nopportunities  from  the  beneficiaries\u2019  perspective;  (ii)  overly  complex  projects;  (iii)  weak \ninstitutions;  (iv)  limited  budgets;  (v)  adverse  impact  of  external  factors;  and  (vi)  weak  project \nadministration.  On  the  other  hand,  the  following  critical  factors  contributed  to  the  success  of \nADB projects: (i) quality of project at entry, (ii) strong country ownership, (iii) flexible design and \na participatory approach, (iv) ability to learn from previous experience and incorporate lessons \ninto  the  project  design,  (v)  good  supervision  of  project  implementation,  and  (vi)  strong  project \nmanagement  units  and  related  oversight  institutions  to  ensure  good  performance  and  timely \ndelivery from the contractors.     \n \n24. \nADB  and  other  development  projects  in  Tajikistan  have  shown  that  effective  project \nimplementation  requires  the  following:  (i)  capable  local  management  staff;  (ii)  international \nconsulting  assistance  to  provide  international  good  practice  in  technical  fields,  and  train  local \nmanagement staff in personnel management, technical aspects, procurement, financial control, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iii) early  establishment  of  a  transparent financial  management \nsystem; (iv) flexibility in implementation, particularly when project design is undertaken in rapidly \nchanging  circumstances  and  with  limited  reliable  information;  (v)  close  supervision  and \nmonitoring of project management to ensure that project implementation capabilities are aligned \nwith  the  objectives,  to  minimize  government  interference  in  the  recruitment  of  national \nconsultants and other support staff, and to ensure the selection of professionally capable staff; \n(vi) recognition that the central and local government administrations have very weak capacity \nand are under-resourced, and can therefore provide only limited support; and (vii) recognition of \nthe vulnerability of project implementation to top-down approaches, because the need to involve \nall  stakeholders,  particularly  beneficiaries,  in  implementation  is  understood  inadequately  or \nresisted.  All  these  identified  lessons  have  been  addressed  to  varying  degrees  in  the  Project\u2019s \ndesign. Implementation must be closely monitored, and the Project must retain the flexibility to \naddress any of the above aspects if they arise. \n \nfrom  ongoing  ADB  regional  assistance  supporting \n25. \ndevelopment of the Central Asian Countries Initiative on Land Management (CACILM), a multi-\ncountry  program  extending  over  ten  years  and  involving  all  five  former  Soviet  Central  Asian \ncountries to systematically identify and address the most important land degradation problems \nin  the  region.  CACILM  is  built  upon  a  framework  of  National  Programming  Frameworks  for \nSustainable Land Management (NPFs) developed for each of the five countries, and the Project \nis  firmly  included  in  the  Tajikistan  NPF  as  high  priority  under  the  country\u2019s  strategy  for \naddressing  land  degradation.  The  NPF  identifies  the  need  for  strengthening  of  policies  and \ninstitutions  as  well  as  the  complementary  on-the-ground  investments  required  both  within  the \nframework  for  generating  financing  to  support  the  identified  priorities,  and  ADB  is  leading  a \nconsortium  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  partners  to  mobilize  such  funding.  In  particular,  the \nGlobal Environmental Facility (GEF) has endorsed a first phase of projects amounting to more \nthan $150 million in investments, with GEF to provide $20 million in grant financing. The project \nis included in this framework, and it is expected to receive $2,500,000 in GEF grant cofinancing \nas part of the CACILM program. \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2006. 2006 Annual Evaluation Review. Manila. \n\nThe  Project  has  benefited \n\n\f 6 \n\n26. \nThe  project  design  options  considered  were  as  follows:  (i)  a  community  development \napproach  focusing  on  essential  infrastructure  to  support  raion  and  community  development; \n(ii) a national approach to addressing one or more of the key constraints identified; and (ii) an \narea-based  project  to  address  multiple  constraints.  The  preferred  design  was  the  area-based \napproach,  which  recognizes  the  interdependencies  among  the  problems  and  constraints.  This \napproach  supports  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  to  rural  development  to  address \nproblems and constraints, enhance opportunities, and integrate agriculture more effectively into \nthe  rural  economy.  It  also  supports  stronger  cooperation  and  coordination  with  national \nagencies, development partners, NGOs, and service providers.  \n \n27. \nThe  Project  will  address  policy  reforms  by  improving  land  use  security,  the  business \nenvironment, and policy directions in pasture management; capacity development in agriculture \nextension  and  business  advisory  services,  and  among  raion  and  jamoat  governments, \ncommunities, and farmers; and investments to improve raion community infrastructure, reverse \nthe  degradation  of  arable  and  pasture  land,  and  set  up  agriculture  extension  and  business \nadvisory services and market information centers.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT10 \n\nProject Area \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project is expected to increase the farm and nonfarm incomes of rural households. \n28. \nIt  will  also  increase  the  productivity  of  farms  and  rural  enterprises  within  an  environmentally \nsustainable management framework. The Project will support individual and cooperative dekhan \nfarms, households, and private rural entrepreneurs.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project area had to meet specific criteria:11  it had to comprise areas that (i) did not \n29. \ngrow cotton or had small (less than 10%) and declining cotton-growing areas, and were focused \non  fruit  and  vegetable  production  and  livestock  raising;  (ii)  were  contiguous,  to  provide \nopportunities for economies of scale and strategic integrated development; (iii) had year-round \nroad access; and (iv) had no similar major projects planned or already under way. From a list of \n28 raions, five were selected: Faizabod, Rudaki, Rogun, Vahdat, and Varzob.  \n \n30. \nThe  project  area  covers  about  8,350  km\u00b2.  Temperature  and  precipitation  vary  widely, \ngiving rise to diverse agro-climatic conditions in a relatively small area. The rural population of \n552,100 is concentrated in the valleys, for an effective population density of nearly 600 persons \nper square kilometer, resulting in increasing pressure on the environment. The area accounts for \nabout  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  official  GDP,  about  77%  of  which  derives  from  agriculture.  Rural \npoverty is widespread: about 40% of the population is designated as poor. Dependent largely on \nsubsistence  agriculture,  the  people  have  few  business  and  employment  opportunities,  and \nmany seek seasonal work abroad, mainly in Russia. \n \n31. \nThe project area comprises (i) 55 collective dekhan farms with an average area of 419 \nha,  (ii)  6,634  private  dekhan  farms  with  an  average  area  of  5  ha,  and  (iii)  69,600  household \nplots ranging in size from 0.15 to 0.30 ha. Of the collective and individual dekhan farms, mainly \nplanted  with  wheat  and  potatoes  and  other  field  crops,  only  about  50%  benefit  from  irrigation. \nHousehold  plots  are  generally  irrigated  at  lower  elevations,  but  are  mostly  rainfed  in  higher \nelevations.  Household  plots  are  planted  with  vegetables,  fruits,  potatoes,  and  wheat,  often \n\n                                                 \n10  More details on the project scope and implementation arrangements are found in Supplementary Appendix A. \n11 These  criteria  and  the  selection  of  the  five  raions  were  agreed  on  between  ADB,  the  project  steering  committee \n\n(PSC), and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) at the start of the project preparatory technical assistance. \n\n\f  7\n\ndouble- or even triple-cropped on at least part of the land. Yields have been increasing but are \nvery low by international standards. \n \n32. \nIn addition, rural-urban linkages and farm support services, such as the supply of seed, \ninputs, and access to credit, are rudimentary near Dushanbe and even less adequate in areas \nfarther away from the capital. \n \n33. \nExcept  for  Rudaki,  all  project  raions  depend  on  budget  subsidies  from  the  national \nGovernment; Faizabod received 85% of its budget from the national Government, Roghun 79%, \nVahdat  43%,  and  Varzob  72%  in  2005.  Raion  governments  do  not  have  enough  resources  to \nensure  adequate  functioning  of  basic  infrastructure,  and  have  limited  administrative  capability \nfor local development.  \n \nNGOs  are  active  in  the  five  project  raions:  Aga  Khan  Foundation  in  Faizobod  and \n34. \nRoghun, Cooperative for Aid and Relief Everywhere in Vahdat and Varzob, and German Agro \nAction in all five raions.  Rudaki has been largely bypassed by NGOs, although the Food and \nAgriculture Organization and Winrock International are active. NGOs provide a broad range of \ndevelopment assistance ranging from the facilitation of mediation in land reform issues, pasture \nmanagement,  farm  advisory  services,  rural  business  development,  and  micro  credit,  to  the \nrebuilding  of  rural  infrastructure.  ADB  is  involved  in  the  irrigation  sector  in  Vahdat,12 and  the \nconstruction  of  the  main  road  and  rural  roads  in  Faizabod,  Rogun,  and  Vahdat.13 The  World \nBank and USAID are working in local governance reform, land reform, and social and economic  \ndevelopment. Further details on the project area are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  has  five  components\u2014four  technical  and  one  project  management\u2014with \nrelated outputs and activities: policy and institutional development and reform; sustainable land \nmanagement  (pasture,  arable,  and  forest);  agriculture  and  rural  business  support;  rural \ninfrastructure development; and project management. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Development and Reform \n\n \nThis component is focused on improving land use security, policies and instructions for \n36. \npasture  land  management,  and  the  administration  and  institutional  aspects  of  business \ndevelopment. This component has three outputs. \n \nTo  improve  the  security  of  land  use  rights  for  farmers  (output  1.1),  the  Project  will \n37. \nimplement  programs  to make  raion officials  more  aware  of their  powers  under  the Land  Code \nand  related  legislation,  and  farmers  more  aware  of  their  rights  and  of  the  available  support \nservices for arbitration and legal redress. Recent and current practices in land registration in the \nproject area will be surveyed to identify the impediments to effective land registration and good \npractices  in  dealing  with  land  registration  disputes,  and  to  discuss  and  agree  with  raion \nadministrations  on  good  practices  to  be  implemented  under  the  Project.  The  results  of  this \nreview  will  inform  the  content  of  the  legal  literacy  and  legal  aid  initiatives  to  make  local \ncommunities in the raions and jamoats more familiar with the rules, processes, and institutions \nrelated  to  the  Land  Code,  particularly  for  land  registration.  After  that,  and  in  association  with \nrelevant organizations and development partners, the Project will facilitate the completion of the \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2004.

This performance will influence the availability and allocation \nof funds for infrastructure investment under the rural infrastructure development component. \n \n \n38. \nPasture  land  management  improvement  activities  (output  1.2)  will  start  with  an \ninternational  conference  to  examine  current  practice  in  Tajikistan,  identify  good  international \npractice relevant to Tajikistan, and raise awareness of management problems. This conference \nwill  be  followed  by  an  assessment  and  the  preparation  of  a  road  map  for  policy,  strategy, \nlegislation, capacity development, and investments in pasture land management. An outline of \nthe sector assessment is shown in Supplementary Appendix C. Finally, the Project will support \nthe  completion  of  a  national  vision,  policy,  strategy,  and  investment  program  for  sustainable \npasture land management, and draft legislation and regulations to facilitate the implementation \nof  the  recommendations  under  component  2.  National  and  regional  workshops  will  be  held  to \nexplain  the  results  and  the  implications  for  raion  administration  of  the  concept  and  process  of \nimproved use of pasture land. \n \n39. \nTo address the varied business environment among the raions  (output 1.3), the Project, \nthrough the project management unit (PMU), will conduct an economic study to demonstrate the \ncosts of administrative interference in farm and business decision making in terms of reduced \ninvestment  and  lost  productivity;  train  raion  and  jamoat  staff  in  the  equitable  and  transparent \ninterpretation of business legislation and help them identify, post, and regularly update a list of \nfines  and  penalties  linked  to  specific  violations  of  laws  and  regulations;  pilot-test  a  simplified \nregistration  procedure,  within  the  existing  legislative  framework,  for  businesses  and  dekhan \nfarms; and monitor changes in the business environment and performance of raion and jamoat \nauthorities. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Sustainable Land Management (Pasture, Arable, and Forest) \n\n \n40. \nThis component comprises a set of linked activities that address the need for better land \nmanagement  by  improving  integrated  pasture  land  and  livestock  techniques,  enhancing \ncapacity, and reversing land degradation. This component has three outputs.  \n \n41. \nThe prioritized recommendations from the pasture land and livestock management study \nand sector assessment (output 1.2) will be pilot-tested in the project area. New techniques and \napproaches  to  grassland  and  livestock  planning  and  management  (output  2.1)  will  be \ndemonstrated  to  improve  pasture  land  conditions  within  an  economically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  framework.  The  pilot  areas  will  serve  as  trial  and  demonstration \nareas preparatory to replication throughout the Project. These activities will be coordinated with \nthe capacity development activities in output 2.2 and the advisory services in output 3.1.  \n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  establish  pilot  sites  with  different  farming  systems  to  demonstrate  the \napplication  of  the  new  pasture  land  and  livestock  planning  and  management  techniques  and \nrehabilitate  and  revegetate  selected  pasture  lands.  Monitoring  protocols  will  be  designed  for \nfarm-level planning and management of livestock production systems in pasture lands, including \nthe impact on social organization. Local specialists will be trained and the monitoring systems \nimplemented  by  concerned  organizations,  with  repeated  surveys  of  indicators  at  appropriate \nseasons  and  points  in  the  production  cycle.  Finally,  the  methodology  will  be  adopted  and \nexpanded within the project area.  \n \n43. \nThe introduction of new concepts of pasture land and livestock management based on \nholistic  thinking  about  economic  goals,  the  social  context,  environmental  conditions  and \nprocesses, animal behavior, and resource constraints requires the establishment of a new cadre \n\n\f  9\n\nof skilled personnel and institutional capacity to provide advice and further training to meet the \nneeds  of  the  country  (output  2.2).  To  address  current  capacity  limitations,  the  Project  will: \nthrough an internationally accredited institution, develop and implement curricula in pasture land \nmanagement  and  train  teaching  staff  at  a  selected  university  or  vocational  institution;  identify \nand support an appropriate organization to establish a network of  cooperating institutions that \nwill disseminate good practice in sustainable land management; use established demonstration \nsites  (output  2.1)  to  give  practical  training  to  students,  demonstrate  successful  practices,  and \nincrease  outreach,  including  links  with  extension  services  (output  3.1);  and  provide  short-term \n(up  to  3  months)  university-level  training  overseas  for  a  number  of  faculty  members  in  the \nselected educational institution.   \n\n \n44. \nThe activities to rehabilitate degraded land will focus on arable, cultivated marginal land, \nand forestry-pasture lands (output 2.3), as pasture land is addressed under outputs 2.1 and 2.2. \nSpecifically, the Project will assess the degradation of these lands at the raion level to identify \nthe  causes,  status,  and  impact  of  land  degradation  to  improve  decision  making  for  land \nmanagement.  This  activity  will  be  carried  out  in  coordination  with  the  Central  Asian  Countries \nInitiative  for  Land  Management  (CACILM),  which  will  be  conducting  a  land  degradation \nassessment  (scheduled  for  2007)  to  gather  baseline  information  for  a  sustainable  land \nmanagement  information  system.  The  Project  will  pilot-test  sustainable  land  management \npractices \ninnovative  onfarm \ntechnologies;  demonstrate  enhanced  agronomic  practices  for  efficient  and  equitable  water \nmanagement;  revegetate  or  rehabilitate  selected  areas;  and  undertake  community  forestry \nactivities  including  selection  and  implementation  of  demonstration  sites,  establishment  of  user \ngroups, training, and workshops. \n \n\nto  develop  and  promote \n\nland  reclamation  and \n\nimproved \n\n3. \n\nAgriculture and Rural Business Support \n\nThis component focuses on establishing farm and rural business advisory services and a \n\n \n45. \nmarket information system. This component has two outputs. \n \n46. \nTo support the establishment and sustainability of the provision of agriculture and rural \nbusiness advisory services (output 3.1), the Project will assess the demand for agricultural and \nrural  business  advisory  services  to  determine  the  number  and  size  of  advisory  centers  to  be \nestablished  and  the  training  and  advice  that  the  centers  should  deliver  to  meet  the  needs  of \nfarmers and enterprises. Advisory centers will be established through contracting NGOs, which \nwill  be  required  to  work  closely  with  other  organizations,  such  as  relevant  research  and \neducational  establishments,  development  partners,  and  other  national  and  international \nagencies.  Each  advisory  center  will  be  staffed  with  specialists;  their  number  and  type  will \ndepend  on  the  need  in  each  raion,  up  to  a  maximum  of  eight  management  and  technical \nspecialists and adequate support staff in each center. The centers will concentrate on providing \ntechnical and economic advice specific to the agricultural and horticultural onfarm activities and \nagriculture  value  chain  services  in  the  project  area  and  in  accordance  with  the  needs  and \nresources  available  to  farmers,  households,  and  businesses.  Training  courses  for  groups  of \nfarmers  will  be  provided  on  crop  and  livestock  production  techniques;  pasture  and  grassland \nmanagement  and  forage  conservation  (in  association  with  activities  under  component  2); \nintegrated  pest  management;  animal  health;  crop  harvesting  and  storage;  sources  and \navailability  of  farm  inputs;  and  current  legislation  affecting  farm  activities.  Demonstration  plots \nwill show farmers practical techniques to improve farm productivity, profitability, and the quality \nof  produce.  The  agricultural  advisers  will  assist  farmers  in  finding  suppliers  of  physical  inputs \nsuch as seed, fertilizer, pesticides, fuel, feedstuffs, and medicines, as well as machinery parts \nand services. Groups of farmers will be formed into informal buying groups to improve access \nto:  inputs,  markets  by  working  with  processors,  and  post-harvest  technology,  transport,  and \nstorage.  Similarly,  the  business  advisers  will  provide  services  to  farmers  and  businesses  on: \ndiversification opportunities; domestic and export marketing; appropriate processing outlets and \n\n\f 10 \n\ncool  chain  facilities;  business  planning;  credit  applications;  the  formation  and  establishment  of \ngroups  for  input  supply,  production,  marketing,  machinery,  processing  etc.;  and  establishment \nand  registration  of  businesses.  The  Project  will  also  develop  and  improve  the  knowledge  and \nskills  base  of  the  advisers.  This  will  initially  be  the  responsibility  of  the  contracted  NGOs.  In \naddition,  the  Project  will  explore  options  for  developing  agriculture  extension  and  farm \nmanagement  programs  at  an  appropriate  educational  institution,  similar  to  the  arrangement \nproposed for pasture land management. \n \n47. \nTo  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  advisory  centers,  the  Project  will  explore \nmechanisms  for  these  centers  to  be  established  as  public  associations  at  start-up  or  within  4 \nyears of their establishment. \n \n48. \nTo address the limited availability and access to micro and rural finance, the Project will \nprovide  a  $4.0  million  credit  line  through  MFIs  for  onlending  to  small  rural  borrowers  in  the \nProject area for working capital and investments.  \n \n49. \nIt  is  expected  that  up  to  three  MFIs  could  participate  in  the  Project.  For  an  MFI  to \nparticipate,  in  addition  to  being  a  microfinance  deposit  organization  or  a  microfinance  lending \norganization, it will have to: (i) have its accounts audited by an international audit company; (ii) \nadhere  to  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  (NBT\u2019s)  prudential  standards;  (iii)  be  prepared  to \nonlend funds in all project raions, unless the Government and ADB agree that full coverage by a \nsingle MFI is not  necessary, and provided that all participating MFIs cover all five project raions; \nand  (iv)  provide  a  business  plan,  acceptable  to ADB,  for  their  proposed  outreach  and  product \ndevelopment  in  the  project  area,  to  demonstrate  their  ability  to  serve  small  farmers  and \nagribusinesses,  and  update  the  plan  annually.  A  competitive  process  will  be  followed  in \nselecting appropriate MFIs, and due diligence of all potentially qualified and interested MFIs will \nbe  undertaken.  MFIs  will  be  required  to  meet  the  following  criteria:  (i)  be  financially  sound; \n(ii) have adequate credit and risk management policies, and operating system and procedures; \n(iii) comply with prudential regulations; (iv) have acceptable corporate and financial governance \nand management practices; (v) have sound business objectives and strategy or plan; (vi) have \nautonomy  in  lending  and  pricing  decisions;  (vii)  have  adequate  policies,  systems,  and \nprocedures \nimpact  of  subprojects;  and  (viii)  have \nenvironmental  screening  processes  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  final  list  of  qualified  MFIs  will  be \nselected and agreed on with ADB. \n \n50. \nTo address the gap in market information, the Project will establish a market information \nunit (MIU) to collect reliable and statistically valid information on prices in markets in the project \narea,  Dushanbe,  and  other  major  urban  areas,  the  cost  of  inputs  and  supply  sources,  and \nmarket trends, and to provide regular information through various media. The establishment of \nthe MIU will be tendered to agencies active in agricultural information dissemination, to enhance \nthe likelihood of its sustainability. Moreover, the Project will assist the MIU in research on import \nsubstitution  and  export  opportunities  and  requirements  by  country  or  destination.  The  unit  will \nanalyze the information, compile it into a readily usable format, and share the information with \nagriculture and rural business advisory services (output 3.1). The MIU will also assist with the \nidentification of foreign buyers and investors. \n \n\nfor  assessing  and  monitoring \n\nthe \n\n4. \n\nRural Infrastructure Development \n\n \n51. \nThis component will strengthen the capacity of raions, jamoats, and communities to plan, \nimplement,  and  maintain  infrastructure,  and  to  support  investments  in  the  small-scale \nconstruction and rehabilitation of local public infrastructure. Eligible investments will include road \n\n\f  11\n\nand  bridge  access,  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  drinking  water  supplies, \nand small-scale electricity generation and distribution.14 This component has two outputs.  \n \n52. \nThe limited planning and maintenance capacity of the raions, jamoats, and communities \nwill  be  improved  in  several  ways  (output  4.1).  Raion  working  groups,  comprising  raion  and \njamoat  officials  and  civil  society  representatives  will  be  established  to:  identify,  prioritize,  and \nplan infrastructure subprojects for rehabilitation or construction in raions and communities; work \nin  partnership  with  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  in  agreeing  on  subprojects  for \nfinancing;  submit  projects  to  the  PMU;  oversee  the  construction  activities;  and  ensure  the \neffective operation and maintenance (O&M) of completed subprojects. CBOs will be established \nto identify and prioritize infrastructure needs, agree on cash or in-kind contributions; determine \nappropriate O&M activities and financing; and work in partnership with the raion working group. \nThe  Project  will  assist  both  raions  and  jamoats  in  preparing  broad-based  plans  for  each \nsubsector in which project proposals will be submitted. These plans will provide an overview of \nthe subsector needs, the current state of assets, existing maintenance programs (including past \nfunding), future infrastructure needs, proposed maintenance plans and funding for existing and \nnew  infrastructure,  and  the  process  of  identifying  and  prioritizing  investment  proposals. \nMoreover,  training  in  planning  processes  and  preparation  of  investment  proposals,  and \nassistance in developing linkages between the investment maintenance proposals and available \nfunding,  will  be  provided.  Each  raion  will  be  provided  with  adequate  equipment  (computers, \nprinters, copiers, and associated software and accessories). \n \n53. \nThe  Project,  through  the  PMU,  will  support  raion  officials  in  ensuring  adequate \nwillingness  and  ability  to  pay  for  the  O&M  of  rehabilitated  or  developed  infrastructure; \nestablishing annual maintenance plans for all infrastructure rehabilitated or developed under the \nProject; ensuring that each community provides the agreed level of financial support (10% of the \ntotal value of labor and materials) or contributions in kind toward maintenance, to remain eligible \nfor  further  works;  establishing  local  maintenance  units  or  user  groups  (e.g.,  water  user \nassociations)  where  these  are  the  most  cost-effective  solution  to  the  problem  of  maintaining \ninfrastructure  in  good  working  condition;  ensuring  that  engineering  drawings,  plans,  and \nspecifications  meet  the  specified  standard;  assisting  with  procurement;  and  supervising  civil \nworks to ensure that they comply with specifications (output 4.2). \n \nFor any raion or community infrastructure subproject to be accepted for funding, it must  \n54. \nbe  demonstrated  that:  (i)  the  level  of  potential  benefits  and  the  number  of  beneficiaries  have \nbeen  assessed;  (ii)  subprojects  have  been  prioritized  in  relation  to  the  quantified  benefits  and \nnumber  of  beneficiaries;  (iii)  communities  have  been  consulted \nidentifying  priority \ninfrastructure;  (iv)  the  subproject  proposal  identifies  clearly  the  associated  O&M  costs  and \nfunding  arrangement  required  to  meet  such  costs  and  includes  an  annual  maintenance  plan; \n(v) the subproject is technically feasible and economically viable, and represents the most cost-\neffective  alternative;  (vi)  an  environmental  impact  assessment  has  been  conducted  in \naccordance  with  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE);  (vii)  adequate  O&M  and  funding \narrangements have been considered, on the basis of consultations with local communities; and \n(viii) all required governmental approvals have been obtained. \n \nFunding  for  each  infrastructure  subproject  will  be  limited  to  $250,000  for  raion \n55. \ninfrastructure  and  $50,000  for  community  infrastructure.  Funding  will  be  provided  in  three \ntranches  in  the  first,  third,  and  fifth  years,  and  will  be  released  to  each  raion  only  when  the \nperformance targets agreed on by the Government and ADB for component 1 have been met. \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n14  Social  infrastructure  projects,  such  as  schools  and  health  services  that  fall  outside  the  broad  definition  of \ninfrastructure supporting the agriculture sector will not be eligible for funding, nor will investments in activities and \nlocations  where  international  funding  agencies  such  as  ADB  have  similar  services  planned  or  under \nimplementation. \n\n\f 12 \n\nThese performance targets will be based on the following indicators: (i) land is allocated through \nan  improved,  transparent  process;  (ii)  registrations  of  farmers\u2019  land  increase  annually;  (iii)  an \neffective  and  fair  system  for  resolving  land  disputes  is  operational;  (iv)  a  simplified  and \ntransparent  registration  procedure  has  been  introduced  and  continues  to  operate  effectively; \nand  (v)  infrastructure  financed  from  earlier  tranches  is  satisfactorily  planned  and  maintained. \nFifty percent of the funds from each tranche will be distributed equally to each of the five project \nraions, and the remaining 50% will be disbursed on a competitive basis to be assessed by the \nPMU  according  to  the  prioritization  assessment,  the  feasibility  of  the  proposed  subproject \ninvestment, the demonstrated physical and financial capacity to maintain the infrastructure, and \nsatisfactory maintenance of previously funded infrastructure. Funds from each tranche release \nwill  be  allocated  twice  yearly  on  the  basis  of  acceptable  proposals  received  from  the  project \nraions.  Proposals  for  infrastructure  subprojects  will  be  submitted  to  the  raion  working  group, \nwhich  will  endorse  subprojects  to  the  PMU  for  final  approval.  The  PMU  will  assess  the \nsubproject  proposals  and  submit  the  prioritized  list  to  the  PSC.  Any  major  deviation  from  the \nPMU recommendations will have to be explained to and approved by ADB. ADB will review the \nprocess of assessing, prioritizing, and approving proposals during regular review missions. \n \nFor  the  community  infrastructure  subprojects,  training  in  priority  setting  for  jamoats  will \n56. \nbe  based  on  simplified  techniques  that  are  appropriate  for  the  scale  of  investment  to  be \nconsidered.  Participatory  decision  making  at  the  local  level  will  be  emphasized.  The  PMU  will \nwork  directly  with  the  raion  working  groups,  jamoats,  and  CBOs  as  appropriate  to  agree  on \ninfrastructure priorities and specific plans. The PMU will also ensure that elite capture does not \noccur  by  working  through  representatives  of  local  community  institutions  and  that  women\u2019s \npriorities are properly reflected in subproject identification and prioritization. \n \nAs  part  of  the  application  process,  local  communities  must  commit  to  meet  the  O&M \n57. \ncosts before subprojects are approved. They will be required to contribute 10% of the total value \nof  labor  and  materials  for  each  subproject.  Labor  inputs  at  current  market  rates  will  be \nconsidered  an  adequate  contribution.  If  labor  inputs  are  likely  to  impose  an  undue  burden  on \nwomen and girls in the project area, the level of community contribution may be adjusted by the \nPMU.  As  far  as  possible,  local  procurement  will  apply.    Local  institutions  and  personnel,  and \nlabor-intensive approaches, where feasible, will be used to complete the work. \n \n \n \n58. \nProject  management  will  be  conducted  through  the  PMU  in  the  MOA.  In  addition, \nmanagement  support  will  be  sought  for  selected  activities  through  cofinancing  arrangements \nwith other development partners, subcontracting of local institutions or NGOs, or service support \nfrom  agencies  that  specialize  in  the  delivery  of  such  services.  Further  details  of  project \nmanagement are described under Implementation Arrangements (section H).  \n \nD. \n \n59. \nPart of the project financing will take the form of a grant. The ADF IX grant will finance \nthe  services  of  international  and  national  consultants,  agricultural  and  rural  business  advisory \nstaff  and  services,  equipment,  vehicles,  training,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  grant \ncomponent  will  increase  awareness  of  land  and  business  rights,  develop  modern  curricula  for \npasture  land  management  and  train  associated  staff,  build  the  capacity  of  raions  to  plan  and \nmaintain infrastructure, and provide the services of international consultants and equipment for \nproject management. See Appendix 4 for further information. \n \n\nADF IX Grant Component  \n\nProject Management \n\n5. \n\n\f  13\n\nSpecial Features \n\nE. \n \nThe Project represents a shift from previous assistance to Tajikistan in that it adopts a \n60. \nmore holistic approach, takes an area focus, shifts assistance away from cotton-growing areas, \ngives emphasis to the development of more effective partnerships, and includes cofinancing. It \nis the first ADB-financed project to be implemented by MOA. \n \n61. \nThe  Project  takes  a  comprehensive,  integrated  approach  to  addressing  fundamental \nconstraints on the shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture, including land security and \nbusiness  environment  limitations.  It  will  undertake  a  nationwide  pasture  land  assessment  and \nprepare  a  road  map  for  policy,  strategy,  legislation,  capacity  development,  and  investment; \nprovide  essential  agriculture  and  business  support  services;  rehabilitate  essential  community \nand  district  infrastructure;  and  address  the  problem  of  increasing  land  degradation\u2014in  each \ncase, to ensure a more effective and coordinated approach to rural development. \n \n62. \nIn  addition,  the  Project  will  build  partnerships  with  ADB\u2019s  development  partners  and \nother organizations. Such partnerships will be enhanced through the contracting out of project \nactivities,  such  as  the  management  information  system  and  agriculture  and  rural  business \nadvisory services, to qualified service providers including NGOs. Moreover, the agriculture and \nrural advisory centers are expected to be legally registered as independent public associations \neither at start-up or no later than the end of the fourth year of the Project. \n \nF. \n \n63. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $23.3 million, including taxes and duties of \n$1.30  million,  $1.16  million  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $0.37  million  in  interest \ncharges  during  implementation.  Cost  estimates  by  project  component  are  summarized  in \nTable 1, while the detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 5 and detailed cost tables in \nSupplementary Appendix D.    \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounts \n  \n\n \nItem \nBase Costa \nA. \n1.

In the event GEF funding is not forthcoming, \n\nADB\u2019s share of financing will increase to 87%. \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n\n The  proposed  ADB  loan  will  finance  37.8%  of  the  total  project  cost  and  will  meet  the \n65. \ncosts of the infrastructure development and the microfinance credit line. The proposed ADF IX \ngrant  will  finance  35.6%  of  the  total  project  cost  and  will  finance  the  consulting  and  advisory \nstaff  services,  training,  surveys  and  monitoring,  vehicles,  and  office  equipment.  The  proposed \nGEF  funds  will  finance  15%  of  the  project  cost,  to  meet  the  costs  of  implementation  of  the \npasture  land  sector  assessment  recommendations,  rehabilitation  of  degraded  land,  consulting \nservices and equipment. The detailed proposal for GEF is in Supplementary Appendix E. The \nGovernment  will  finance  7.1%  of  the  project  cost  in  taxes  and  duties,  and  the  services  of  the \neducation institution staff who will be involved in pasture land curriculum development, teaching, \nand  capacity  development.  Beneficiary  contributions  for  the  community  infrastructure  and \nanticipated  contributions  of  our  funds  to  investments  by  subborrowers  of  the  credit  line  will \nfinance 4.5% of the project cost. The beneficiaries will also contribute to the maintenance of the \ninfrastructure on completion, but these costs have not been estimated. \n \n66. \nADB  has  typically  sought  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of  loan  or  grant  funds \nfrom cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place.  In the case of the proposed \ngrant funding from GEF, the full GEF project proposal is being finalized and submitted to GEF \ntogether  with  this  Report.  To  avoid  any  Project  delay,  the  Board  is  requested  to  approve  the \nadministration of the proposed GEF grant, in the amount of $3,500,000, which is expected to be \nobtained subsequent to the date of Board approval.  Approval of the GEF grant will be reported \nto  the  Board  in  accordance  with  standard  reporting  procedures.  If  GEF  does  not  approve \nfinancing, the Sustainable Land (Pasture, Arable and Forest Land) Management component will \nbe  significantly  affected  with  the  support  for  pasture  management  field  trials,  demonstrations, \nand training; and establishment of a pastures management program at a selected university or \nvocational  level  institution  removed  from  the  Project.  Nevertheless,  the  Agriculture  and  Rural \nBusiness  Support  Component  will provide  some  extension  support  to farmers  in  livestock  and \npasture management. Other aspects of the Project including the pasture sector assessment will \nnot be significantly affected. \n \n67. \n \nH. \n \n68. \nGiven the complexity of the Project, the uniqueness of its approach in Tajikistan, the low \ncapacity  of  local  institutions,  and  the  changing  nature  of  activities  resulting  from  the  ongoing \ntransition  to  a  market-oriented  economy,  a  flexible  approach  to  project  implementation  is \n\nDisbursements will be based on the percentages in the Financing Agreement. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n\f  15\n\nneeded.  However,  more  flexibility  will  require  a  more  concerted  focus  on  the  monitoring  and \nsupervision of the Project by both the Government and ADB.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nThe project management arrangements include a PSC, MOA as Executing Agency (EA), \n69. \nthe State Committee for Land Management (SCLM) as Implementing Agency (IA), and a PMU \nin the EA. See Appendix 6 for the organization chart. \n \nThe implementation of the Project will be guided by a PSC comprising the MOA (chair), \n70. \nand representatives of the office of the President, MOF, SCLM, Ministry of Economy and Trade, \nMinistry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land  Reclamation,  State  Committee  on  Environmental \nProtection  and  Forestry,  Tajikistan  Agricultural  Academy  of  Sciences,  raion  administrations, \nfarmers,  private  sector  representatives,  the  NGO  sector,  development  partners,  ADB,  and  the \nproject manager. The PSC will (i) guide the overall policy and strategic direction of the Project, \n(ii) review and evaluate project performance, (iii) review the audited project accounts, (iv) select \nthe consultants for the implementation through the tender committee; (v) endorse or reject PMU \nproposals  for  rural  infrastructure  improvements  under  component  4;  (vi)  facilitate  interagency \ncoordination as well as coordination of project activities with activities taking place under other \nprojects  financed  by  development  partners  in  the  project  raions;  (vii)  resolve  issues  affecting \nproject  implementation;  and  (viii)  provide  guidance  as  needed.  The  PSC  will  meet  monthly \nduring the first 4 months of the Project, and every 6 months after that, when the Project is well \nestablished, to review progress. The PMU will serve as the secretariat for the tender committee \nthat will review and evaluate all procurement proposals for consulting services, civil works, and \ngoods. The tender committee will be composed of the MOA (chair), MOF, SCLM, the national \nprocurement  agency,  the  PMU  manager,  the  PMU  procurement  specialist,  representatives  of \nthe project raions, and others as deemed necessary by the chair of the tender committee.   \n \n71.  MOA, as the EA, will (i) disburse ADB loan and grant proceeds; (ii) keep accurate and \nduplicate  records  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursements  under  the  project  accounts; \n(iii) submit  to  ADB  progress  and  other  reports  prepared  by  the  PMU;  (iv)  ensure  the  timely \nsubmission  of  audited  accounts  of  the  Project  to  ADB;  (v)  coordinate  communication  and \ninteraction  between  SCLM,  the  raion  administrations,  contracted  service  providers,  and  ADB; \nand  (vi)  provide  necessary  guidance  as  appropriate.  A  project  director  from  MOA  will  be \nappointed  and  funded  by  the  Government  on  a  part-time  basis.  He  or  she  will  oversee  the \nProject and will report to the minister of agriculture and the PSC on major issues. \n \nThe SCLM, as the IA, will be responsible for: (i) policy and institutional arrangements for \n72. \npasture  lands  (output  1.2),  (ii)  improvement  of  pasture  land  and  livestock  planning  and \nmanagement  skills  (output  2.1),  (iii)  development  of  capacity  for  effective  land  management \n(output  2.2),  and  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  degraded  lands  (output  2.3).  In  relation  to  the  foregoing \nactivities,  SCLM  will  (i)  be  responsible  for  direct,  day-to-day  management,  (ii) participate  in  all \ncommittees for procurement and consulting services, and (iii) prepare quarterly monitoring and \nevaluation reports for submission to the PMU, CACILM, GEF, and ADB. The SCLM will provide \nreports to the PMU. \n \n73. \nThe  report  on  the  financial  management  assessment  of  MOA  (see  Supplementary \nAppendix  F)  concluded  that  the  MOA  had  significant  accounting  weaknesses  (lack  of  internal \ncontrol  and  audit;  lack  of  external  audit;  limited  number  of  qualified  staff  and  lack  of \naccountability;  limited  computerization;  lack  of  proper  planning,  effective  operational  analysis, \nand  rational  use  of  funds;  and lack of  proper  communication  with  regional  units  of MOA),  and \nwas  therefore  not  equipped  to  administer  project  funds  directly.  Other  development  partner \nprojects  for  which  the  MOA  was  or  is  the  executing  agency  were  implemented  by  various \nseparate project management or implementation units. The financial management assessment \n\n\f 16 \n\nreport  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  PMU  with  representative  offices  in  the  project \nraions.  \n \n74. \nA  PMU  will  be  established  to  ensure  the  effective  implementation  and  management  of \nthe Project and to ensure the appropriate use of funds to produce the anticipated results under \nthe  Project.  The  PMU  will  include  a  project  manager,  a  procurement  and  consulting  services \nspecialist,  suitably  qualified  accounting  and  bookkeeping  staff,  national  and  international \nconsultants,  and  other  staff.  During  project  start-up  the  PMU  staff  will  work  with  relevant  ADB \nstaff to ensure effective compliance with ADB and government project rules and procedures. \n \n75. \nThe  PMU  will  (i)  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  its  design; \n(ii) ensure  effective  coordination  of all  activities  and  agencies  involved;  (iii)  ensure compliance \nwith  environmental  requirements  and  other  safeguard  measures;  (iv)  maintain  appropriate \naccounts,  including  reports  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursements;  (v)  manage \nprocurement in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines; and (vi) prepare quarterly progress and other \nreports  in  formats  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  At  the  start,  the  PMU  will  have  one  local \nrepresentative  each  for  Rudaki  and  Vahdat,  and  one  for  Faizabod  and  Rogun.  Varzob  will  be \nserved from the PMU in Dushanbe. The local representative, located in the raion administration, \nwill  (i)  monitor  implementation  in  the  raion,  (ii)  support  raion  officials  in  implementation, \n(iii) coordinate  with  local  communities  to  ensure  their  satisfaction  with  the  Project,  (iii)  provide \ncoordination  between  implementing  agencies,  and  (iv)  provide  statistical  data  to  the  PMU. \nDepending on satisfactory progress and need, the possibility of having a representative for each \nraion will be considered during the first major project review (18 months into the Project). \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n76. \nThe Project will be implemented over 7 years, from March 2007. By 31 March 2014, all \nwithdrawal  applications  from  the  loan  must  have  been  submitted,  approved,  and  authorized. \nThe  closing  date  for  disbursements  will  be  30 September  2014.  The  implementation  schedule \nfor the Project is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as \n77. \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  finance  the  procurement  of  vehicles,  materials,  and \nequipment,  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9).  Contracts  valued  at  the \nequivalent of $1 million or more will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). \nContracts valued at less than $1 million equivalent may follow ICB, national competitive bidding \n(NCB),  or  limited  international  bidding,  as  determined  by  the  particular  circumstances  of  the \ncontract  package.  Contracts  below  $100,000  equivalent  may  follow  the  shopping  procedure. \nThe relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption (1998) will be included in all documents \nduring the bidding for, and implementation of, the Project. \n \n78. \nBefore  the  start  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications in the Government\u2019s procedures will be documented in \nthe procurement plan. \n \n79. \nFor the procurement of goods and services to be financed with the subloans to farmers \nfrom  the  MFIs,  the  MFIs  will  demonstrate  that  the  procurement  procedures  are  appropriate \nunder  the  circumstances,  and  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Anticorruption  and  to  established \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n\f  17\n\n80. \nAdvance action is required for consulting services for project implementation to establish \nthe PMU, including the hiring of the project manager, the financial management specialist, and \nthe procurement officer. Retroactive financing of $100,000 equivalent is necessary to cover the \nexpenditures  for  these  activities  incurred  before  loan  and  grant  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier \nthan  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  Financing  Agreement.  The  advance  recruitment  of \nconsultants  must  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  early \nrecruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to approving or otherwise financing the Project. \nAdvance  action  would  enable  the  early  preparation  of  draft  documents  for  the  contracting  of \nvarious  services  required  under  the  Project,  and  would  require  the  Government  to  agree  to \nfinance the PMU and staff before loan and grant effectiveness (March or April 2007).   \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n81. \nThe  Project  will  provide  2,260  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  184 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  and  2,076  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices.  This  high  level  of  consulting  services,  and  particularly  international  technical \nassistance,  is  essential,  given  the  nature  of  the  Project  and  the  gap  between  global  good \npractice  and  current  techniques  used  in  Tajikistan.  This  need  applies  in  particular  to  the \nnationwide pasture sector assessment and the development of sustainable agriculture and rural \nadvisory  services.  Effective  project  management  and  monitoring  will  be  equally  important  to \nensure  the  effective  transfer  of  knowledge  and  conduct  of  the  surveys,  and  continuous \nmonitoring  of  project  outputs  and  outcome.  Institutional  and  capacity  development  has  been \nbuilt  into  the  project  design.  The  consultants  will  provide  project  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment  in  land  use  security;  pasture,  arable,  and  forestry  pasture  land  rehabilitation; \ndevelopment  of  advisory  services  and  market  information;  infrastructure  planning;  O&M;  and \nproject management and monitoring. \n \n82. \nThe  consultants  will  be  selected  under  separate  consulting-firm  contracts,  one  for  the \npasture land sector assessment and implementation (output 1.2), another for the development \nof curricula and capacity in pasture land management at an educational institution (output 2.2), \nand  a  third  for  project  management  (component  5).  The  international  consultants  will  be \nrecruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, with the use of full technical \nproposals  and  quality-based  selection  for  the  pasture  land  sector  assessment  and  the \ndevelopment of curricula and capacity in pasture land management, and full technical proposals \nand quality and cost-based selection for project management. Outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 10 and detailed terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n83. \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998),  as  amended  to  date,  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  of  Tajikistan.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Anticorruption  will  be \nincluded  in  the  loan  and  grant  regulations  and  in  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will specify the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and of all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n84. \nIn  relation  to  the  Project,  the  Government  will  ensure  the  disclosure  of  Project-related \nprocurement  actions,  including  consulting  services  contracts  and  the  procurement  of  major \nequipment and civil works, in local newspapers and on the internet. Such disclosed information \nwill include, among other matters, the list of participating bidders, the winning bidder, reference \n\n\f 18 \n\nto the tender procedures adopted, the amount of the contract awarded, and general terms and \nspecifications of the goods, works, or services procured.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n85. \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  For  consulting  services  and \nequipment  following  ICB  procedures,  loan  and  grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  through  direct \npayment. For civil works following NCB procedures and small expenditures related to the PMU, \nreimbursement  and  imprest  fund  procedures  will  be  applied.  Two  imprest  accounts  will  be \nopened by the EA: one for the loan funds and one for the grant funds. These imprest accounts \nwill be established and managed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial \ndeposit in the loan imprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for 6 months of \nproject  implementation  or  10%  of  the  loan,  whichever  is  less.  The  initial  deposit  in  the  grant \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditure  for  6  months  of  project \nimplementation or 10% of the grant, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) \nprocedure  will  be  applied  when  reimbursing  eligible  project  outlays  and  liquidating  and \nreplenishing the imprest accounts for individual payments of up to $50,000. The EA will submit \nrequests for replenishment to ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nFlow of Funds \n\n \n86. \nApart from the credit line to be provided through participating MFIs, all loan funds will be \nprovided to the EA in the form of a grant. The credit line will be administered under subsidiary \nloan agreements entered into between the Government, through MOF, and the MFIs, and under \nproject agreements between ADB and each MFI. MOF will lend the credit line funds directly to \nMFIs  licensed  by  the  NBT  as  microfinance  deposit  organizations  or  microfinance  lending \norganizations. The MOF will relend these funds in somoni or US dollars for 10 years, with a 2-\nyear  grace  period.  The  interest  rate  under  the  subsidiary  lending  arrangements  between  the \nGovernment and the MFIs will cover the costs of funds from ADB plus an administration charge. \nThe relending initial rate for loan in TJS will be 75% of the interbank lending rate of the National \nBank of Tajikistan. The relending interest rate for loans in dollars will be at a floating rate based \non the 6-month LIBOR for dollars. The MOF will pass the foreign exchange risk on to the MFIs. \n \n87. \nFunds  under  the  credit  line  will  be  onlent  to  farmers  and  agribusinesses  as \nsubborrowers.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  subloans  will  provide  working  capital  and  onfarm  and \nbusiness  investments  for  the  development  of  agricultural  production,  and  the  development  of \ninput  supply,  machinery  services,  storage,  packing,  marketing,  and  related  agribusiness  and \nservice  enterprises.  The  subborrowers  will  prepare  business  plans  and  should  have \ncommercially  viable  subprojects  with  adequate  collateral,  financial  rates  of  return,  and  a \ndemonstrated  repayment  capacity.  MFIs  will  onlend  the  credit  line  to  eligible  subborrowers \nunder separate loan agreements acceptable to ADB. Subject to the procedures agreed on with \nADB, the MFIs will have full authority to select subborrowers, approve subloans, and determine \nlending terms according to their own credit policy. Subloans to subborrowers may be made in \nsomoni  or  US  dollars.  The  lending  arrangements  for  the  subloans  from  MFIs  to  subborrowers \nwill  be  reviewed  regularly,  as  required,  and  adjusted  if  necessary.  All  subloans  exceeding \n$20,000 and the first five subloans of each MFI will be approved by ADB before disbursement.  \nAll MFIs will submit a quarterly loan portfolio report and an annual external audit report to ADB \nby 30 June each year. \n \n88. \nFunding  for  the  infrastructure  subprojects  will  be  channeled  from  MOF  directly  to  the \nloan imprest account managed by the PMU. The PMU will be responsible for all procurement of  \ngoods, works, and services. Local procurement of parts and materials, and the use of local labor \nin  implementation,  will  be  encouraged.  The  PMU  will  report  to  ADB  on overall  progress  in  the \n\n\f  19\n\nimplementation of raion-specific activities, the selection of rural infrastructure proposals, and the \ndisbursement of funds. See Appendix 7 for the flow of funds.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nProject  accounts  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  maintained  by  the  EA  through  the  PMU \n89. \naccording to the provisions of the financing agreement and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB.15 The EA, on behalf of \nthe  Government  and  through  the  PMU,  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  that  will \nallow  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the loan  and  grant  proceeds,  and  government \nfinancing to be identified and its use to be disclosed, following sound accounting principles. The \naccounts will show total expenditures by category of project output. They will record (i) amounts \nspent by the EA, (ii) amounts by project output, and (iii) amounts by loan and grant financing.  \n \n90. \nIndependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  these  accounts  and  records  yearly. \nWithin 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit reports in English, \ntogether  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion,  will  be  submitted  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  audit \nreports  will  include  a  management  letter  and  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccounts and SOE procedure. The Government has been advised that delays in the submission \nof audited financial statements may result in the suspension of loan and grant disbursements by \nADB.  For the external audit of accounts, the loan proceeds may finance the services of private \nsector  auditors  and  the  translation  of  their  reports  into  English,  provided  that  (i)  such  auditors \nare  qualified,  capable,  and  acceptable  to  ADB;  and  (ii)  the  auditors  are  recruited  in  a  manner \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nIn  addition,  internal  audit  procedures  will  be  established.  A  periodic  auditor,  to  be \n91. \nemployed with the use of grant project funds, will spot-check cash, bank account, and all other \nfinancial and related records for the Project at least 1 day per month for the first 3 years. The \nauditor will specifically compare the relative costs of items such as fuel and consumables, and \nof  vehicles  and  equipment,  with  those  under  similar  projects,  and  the  subsequent  use  of  the \nitems, to ensure fair procurement and specific use for project activities. Subject to the findings of \nthe internal audit, this procedure may be extended.  \n \nThe  MFIs  will  be  required  to  maintain  separate  project  accounts  for  the  funds  spent \n92. \nunder the Project. They must also maintain their overall accounts, audits, and financial status as \nrequired by the NBT and ADB. The MFIs\u2019 annual accounts\u2014comprising balance sheets, income \nstatements,  and  fund  flow  statements  at  a  minimum\u2014must  conform  to  international  financial \naccounting  standards.  The  annual  accounts  and  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. Copies of  the accounts and audit reports in English, \ntogether  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  and  management  letter,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6 \nmonths of the close of each financial year.  \n \n93. \nThe EA, through the PMU, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate the progress made, problems encountered, steps taken to remedy the problems, a \nprogram of activities, and expected progress during the remaining implementation period. The \nreports  will  also  incorporate  the  project  performance  monitoring  data  and  all  relevant  financial \ndata. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and quality, and will be consistent \nwith  international  and  local  reporting  standards,  as  well  as  with  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). The EA will also provide such other reports and information relating to \nthe project as ADB may reasonably request, including policy and institutional measures related \nto security of land use, development of pasture land, and the enabling environment for business \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2002.

Within  6  months  after  project \ncompletion,  the  EA,  through  its  PMU,  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  detailing \nloan  and  grant  proceeds,  and \ninformation  on  project \naccomplishments regarding the project outcomes and impact.   \n \n\nimplementation,  use  of \n\nthe \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n94. \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project  in  achieving  the  planned  outputs  and  outcome, \nthe PMU will establish and maintain a project performance monitoring system within 6 months of \nproject  effectiveness.  During  project  inception,  a  matrix  of  sub-indicators  that  substantiate  the \ncore performance indicators in Appendix 1 will be developed in a participatory manner. Where \nfeasible, community-based monitoring mechanisms will be developed to strengthen participation \nand community level decision making. The performance monitoring system will be presented to \nthe PSC during project inception for verification. Baseline data for the agreed indicators will be \ngathered,  and  updated  every  6  months.  These  data  will  be  reported  to  other  development \npartners, interested stakeholders, and the public.  \n \nThe GEF-financed activities will require monitoring, evaluation, and reporting to CACILM \n95. \nand GEF. Information from the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will feed into the \nCACILM  national  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  which  will  cover  all  CACILM  projects  in \nTajikistan  and  will  target  four  types  of  information:  (i)  land  degradation  and  sustainable  land \nmanagement  indicators  for  the  design  and  monitoring  framework;  (ii)  compliance  with \nenvironmental and social safeguards that may be prescribed by the cofinancing agreements of \nthe  Strategic  Partnership  Agreement 16  members;  (iii)  project  implementation,  including  the \nrecording and tracking of work plan progress, all project inputs, and all activities; and (iv) project \nfinances,  including  annual  disbursements,  contracts  awarded,  and  annual  audited  financial \nstatements \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n96. \nSemiannual  reviews  will  be  conducted  in  the  first  few  years  of  project  implementation \nuntil  ADB  determines  that  an  annual  review  will  be  sufficient  for  effective  administration  and \nimplementation.  Besides  these  regular  reviews,  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out jointly by the Government, MOA, SCLM, and ADB after 18 months, and a midterm \nreview  after  3.5  years  of  implementation.  These  reviews  will,  among  other  things,  assess  the \noverall  progress  of  the  Project  and  the  need  for  changes  in  its  design  and  implementation \narrangements.  At  the  end  of  the  Project,  the  EA  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  and \nsubmit it to ADB within 6 months of project completion. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe technical assistance Capacity Development for Planning and Management in Local \n97. \nGovernment  will  improve  economic  and  social  development  in  the  five  raions  of  Faizabod, \nRogum, Rudaki, Vardat, and Varzob. The outcome is improved capacity in economic and social \nplanning. The TA will focus on: (i) approaches to planning and management appropriate to the \ninstitutional and resource capacity of the raions; (ii) coordination strategies and arrangements to \noptimize  the  effectiveness  of  development  activities  in  each  raion  and  in  the  area  of  the  five \nraions,  at  jamoat,  community,  and  national  levels;  (iii)  systems  and  procedures  for  planning, \n\n                                                 \n16 Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  for  United  Nations  Convention  to  Combat  Drought  and  Desertification \nImplementation  in  the  Central  Asian  Countries.

A  grant  of  $600,000  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram  will  finance  the  services  of  international  (12  person-months)  and  national consultants \n(108 person-months). MOA will be the EA for the TA, which will be implemented over 36 months, \nfrom  2007.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases.  Details  of  the  TA  are  shown  in \nAppendix 11. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits17 \n\n \nA. \n \n98.  Without the Project, low incomes and high rates of rural poverty, caused by low crop and \nlivestock yields and an environment that is not conducive to commercial farming, agribusiness, \nand  rural  enterprises,  will  persist.  The  features  of  this  unfavorable  environment  are:  (i)  poorly \ndefined  and  ambiguous  land  use  rights;  (ii)  distortionary  interventions  by  local  government \nagencies in onfarm production and marketing decisions; (iii) very poorly developed input supply \nmarkets;  (iv)  lack  of  functioning  agricultural  extension  and  rural  business  advisory  services; \n(v) lack  of  access  to  credit  for  onfarm  investments,  agribusiness,  and  other  rural  enterprises; \nand  (vi)  deteriorating  farm  and  nonfarm  rural  infrastructure.  The  Project  will  address  all  these \nconstraints  to  increasing  rural  incomes  by  improving  crop  and  livestock  yields,  pasture  land \nmanagement, and opportunities for farmers, agribusinesses, and rural enterprises.  \n\n \n99. \nImproved  land  use  security  for  about  7,000  farmers,  through  facilitation  of  the  ongoing \nfarm  restructuring  and  land  registration  process,  in  collaboration  with  other  development \npartners  working  on  land  reform  issues,  is  a  key  benefit.  This  is  expected  to  stimulate  private \nsector-led growth in the agriculture and agribusiness sectors.  \n\n \n\n100.  Secure  land  use  rights,  together  with  agricultural  extension  services,  credit,  and \nimproved  input  supply,  are  expected  to  improve  crop  productivity  significantly.  The  financial \nanalysis based on crop budgets shows an increase in farm-level gross margins by about 105% \nto 171% for different crops 2 years after the expected completion of the Project. The envisaged \nincrease  in  gross  margins  is  based  on  a  30\u201340%  increase  in  crop  yields.  These  productivity \nincreases are realistic, because yields significantly declined below their natural potential during \nthe post-Soviet era of civil war. Consequently, per capita incomes are expected to increase to \nTJS580  ($171)  for  rainfed  crop  farms  and  TJS804  ($237)  for  irrigated  farms  from  a  current \naverage per capita income of TJS200 ($60).  \n \n101.  Currently, about 140,000 head of cattle and nearly 200,000 sheep and goats are raised \nin the project area on 350,000 ha of poorly managed pasture lands. Livestock production also \nhas  potential  for  productivity  improvement.  Secure  land  use  and  proper  pasture  land \nmanagement,  together  with  necessary  support  services,  can  realistically  increase  annual  milk \nproduction by at least 50%, the total number of calves reared by 100%, lambing percentages by \n100%,  and  kidding  percentages  to  150%.  These  improvements  will  allow  about  35,000  farm \nfamilies  that  currently  have  livestock  in  the  project  area  to  increase  their  incomes  and  assets \nsignificantly.  In  addition,  the  nutrition  of  these  farm  families  will  also  improve  with  increased \nlivestock production. \n \n102.  As shown by the indicative models of financial analysis, the Project\u2019s credit line, together \nwith  rural  business  development  services,  will  generate  significant  benefits  by  supporting \nprofitable agricultural processing and other rural enterprises. The rural infrastructure, prioritized \n                                                 \n17  Supplementary Appendix H contains further details on the financial and economic analysis. \n\n\f 22 \n\nby  the  local  communities  will  remove  existing  physical  infrastructure  constraints.  Indicative \nmodels  of  three  irrigation  rehabilitation  projects  generate  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR)  of  60\u201370%.  The  high  EIRR  is  due  to  the  substantial  sunk  cost  and  low  cost  of \nrehabilitation required to improve the reliability of water supply. For three water supply projects, \nan  analysis  of  the  time  savings  in  water  collection  compared  with  investment  costs  shows \nsignificant and robust returns. \n \n103.  The  results  of  the  Project-wide  economic  analysis,  excluding  the  rural  infrastructure \ncomponent,  show  an  economic  return  of  18%.  According  to  the  sensitivity  analysis,  the \neconomic returns are stable, with either an increase in cost or a reduction in benefits of 20% or \na  3-year  delay  in  project  benefits  reducing  the  EIRR  to  about  14%.  See  Supplementary \nAppendix H for details on financial and economic analysis. \n \n104.  The Project will bring social benefits by improving land use security, the rural business \nenvironment, access to pastures, and livelihood activities. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguard Issues \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n105.  The Project has been classified as category B by ADB. An IEE has been prepared. The \nProject is not likely to cause any significant negative environmental impact. It is likely to have a \nsignificant  positive  impact  on  soil  and  water  resources,  grassland  productivity,  watershed \ncondition,  agricultural  development,  and \ninstitutional  development.  The  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  outlines  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements.  Budgets  for  environmental  staff  and  environment  assessment  and  monitoring \nactivities have been included. The EMP is to be revised, as necessary, during project inception. \nSpecific environmental assessment and review procedures have been developed, and included \nin  the  EMP,  for  the  environmental  assessment  of  rural  infrastructure  projects  during \nimplementation. The IEE is in Supplementary Appendix I and the summary initial environmental \nexamination is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n\n2. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n106.  The investments of the type and size anticipated under the Project are not expected to \nhave any significant land acquisition or resettlement impact. Given the possibility of minor land \nacquisition  for  the  construction  or  rehabilitation of  community  and  raion  infrastructure,  and  the \nlikelihood  of  impact  on  productive  assets,  particularly  on  agricultural  land  through  irrigation \nrehabilitation,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  (Appendix  13).  When  subprojects \nare designed and impacts identified, a short resettlement plan will be prepared according to the \nresettlement framework.  \n \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n \nIn the project area, more than 11% (62,617) of the population is of ethnic minority origin. \n107. \nThe  major  ethnic  minority  is  the  ethnic  Uzbek  group,  which  accounts  for  more  than  98% \n(61,365)  of  the  ethnic  population.  However,  more  than  70%  (43,616)  of  the  ethnic  Uzbek \nminority is found in the non-cotton-growing jamoats of Rudaki, 27% (16,723) in Vahdat, and the \nremaining 3% in Varzob. Other smaller ethnic minority groups include Russians (found in very \nsmall numbers in each of the project raions and primarily married to ethnic Tajik), Kyrgyz, and \nUkrainians. \n \n\n\f  23\n\nGender and Development \n\n108.  A  range  of  specific  actions  targeted  at  ethnic  minority  groups  have  been  designed  to \nensure  they  will  also  benefit  proportionately  from  the  Project.  These  include:  (i)  the  use  of \nfacilitators fluent in the Uzbek language, (ii) the inclusion of at least one ethnic Uzbek facilitator, \nwhere necessary, among community-based facilitators in local communities; (iii) the hiring of a \nnational  gender  and  social  development  specialist  with  an  understanding  of  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment issues, to spend up to 30% of the consulting assignment supporting ethnic Uzbek \ncommunities; and (iv) budget support specifically for the monitoring of project impact on ethnic \nminority groups, including the use of participatory techniques to ensure the active involvement \nof ethnic minority stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation of project benefits. More details \non specific actions for ethnic minorities are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nC. \n \n109.  Key  findings  of  the  gender  analysis  show  the  need  to  address  specific  gender  issues. \nThe Project will take actions to: (i) improve women\u2019s formal access to land, thereby increasing \nland use security; (ii) adopt participatory processes to facilitate the active participation of women \nin  the  Project,  including  demand-driven,  community-based  infrastructure  projects;  (iii)  provide \nbusiness  advisory  services  to  women  and  leverage  access  to  microcredit  through  MFIs  for  a \nrange  of  farm  and  nonfarm  activities;  (iv)  increase  the  agricultural  knowledge  of  women;  and \n(v) promote  gender  responsiveness  among  policy  makers  and  other  stakeholders  involved  in \nthe Project. More specific actions for each project component are contained in the gender action \nplan  (Appendix  14).  To  enhance  participation,  a  participation  plan  has  been  prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix L). \n \nD. \n \n110.  Project sustainability depends on five main factors: (i) land use security, (ii) sustainable \nland management, (iii) continuous provision of agricultural extension and business development \nservices,  (iv)  maintenance  of  rural  infrastructure,  and  (v)  continuous  provision  of  credit  for \nonfarm investments and agribusinesses.  \n \n111.  The  Project  will  facilitate  the  registration  of  farms  and  access  to  legal  services. \nInfrastructure investment will be contingent on the satisfactory performance of raion and jamoat \nofficials in ensuring land use security. \n \n112.  The Project will demonstrate new sustainable land management practices, build capacity \nand demonstrate skills in their use, and rehabilitate degraded lands. The proposed activities will \ncontribute  to  an  enabling  environment,  within  which  land  improvement  and  rural  development \ncan take place in an integrated manner. Resulting improvements in the productivity of land will \ncontribute to increases in farm incomes, further reinforcing project sustainability. \n\nProject Sustainability \n\n \n\n113.  Agricultural  and  business  development  services  will  be  provided  at  the  start  by \ncontracted  NGOs  or  other  organizations  with  the  capacity  to  deliver  these  services  efficiently. \nThese  will  establish  advisory  centers,  which  will  be  registered  as  independent  public \nassociations. \n \n\n114.  A  set  of  criteria  will  be  developed  for  determining  the  feasibility  of  each  rural \ninfrastructure  subproject  proposed  for  funding  under  the  Project.  Among  other  criteria,  the \nproponents should demonstrate the financial, physical, and institutional capacity to maintain the \nproposed  infrastructure.  Subproject  proposals  that  cannot  demonstrate  sustainability  of  O&M \nwill not be funded by the Project. \n \n115.  The  credit  line  will  be  developed  without  any  distortions  in  the  financial  market \nparameters and will be operated under prevailing market conditions. Therefore, the participating \n\n\f 24 \n\nProject Risks \n\nMFIs  are  likely  to  generate  adequate  revenue  to  continue  their  credit  operations  in  the \nagriculture sector after the Project. \n \nE. \n \n116.  There  are  some  risks  associated  with  the  Project.  The  success  of  market-oriented \nprivate farming and agribusiness depends heavily on the provision of secure land use rights to \nfarmers  and  an  improved  enabling  business  environment.  While  appropriate  legislation  exists, \nthese \nlevel.  The \nimplementation of the land use reform and farm restructuring program without any unnecessary \nintervention from regional and local government authorities is important for the success of the \nProject. The Project attempts to reduce this risk through continuous dialogue with higher levels \nof  government,  and  necessary  training  and  capacity  development  for  both  farmers  and  local \ngovernment officials, to facilitate the reform process. \n\ninto  meaningful  actions  at \n\nlaws  are  variously \n\ntranslated \n\nlocal \n\nthe \n\n117.  The  Project  includes  the  implementation  of  existing  land  use  policy  and  legislation, \ninvestments,  capacity  development,  and  the  dissemination  of  technical  and  business-related \nknowledge.  The  knowledge  and  capacity  development  components,  generally,  have  much \nhigher multiplier impact, but the benefits are long-term and mostly intangible. There is a risk that \nthe  investment  components,  particularly  infrastructure  components,  may  assume  a  prominent \nrole  in  the  Project  and  take  resources  away  from  the  policy,  capacity  development,  and \nknowledge components. The Project addresses this risk by applying a cap on the infrastructure \ncomponent of the Project. \n\n118.  The development partner community has noted corruption, fraud, and abuse of funds in \nprevious and current projects. ADB will address these issues by ensuring that proper accounting \nand  procurement  staff  will  be  placed  in  the  PMU.  In  addition,  an  independent  audit  of  the \naccounts by a certified and reputable auditing firm will be conducted to reduce the risk of misuse \nof ADB funds. \n \n\n119.  Poor  financial  management  capacity  of  the  government  agencies  poses  a  financial \nmanagement risk. Adequate capacity will be built in the PMU to reduce this risk.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n120.  Another  potential  risk  to  the  Project  is  a  drop  in  the  prices  of  agricultural  commodities \ndue  to  oversupply.  The  main  market  targeted  by  the  Project  is  Dushanbe,  and  its  growth  in \ndemand  is  limited.  The  Project  plans  to  mitigate  this  risk  through  improved  processing  of \nagricultural  products  by  providing  credit  and  business  development  support  services.  In \naddition, the business development service will explore possibilities for improving the export of \nfresh and processed produce. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n121. \nfollowing assurances in the legal documents: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  include  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  shall  make  available  all  counterpart  funds  required  for  the \nProject  and  on  an  annual  basis  for  each  fiscal  year  make  adequate  budgetary \nallocations  required  to  implement  the  Project,  including  the  requirements  of  the \nIEE,  EMP,  gender  action  plan,  participation  plan,  specific  actions  for  ethnic \nminorities, and resettlement framework; \nThe land use rights of farmers shall be improved by (a) issuing the required land \nuse certificates in all dekhan farms in the project area, and (b) protecting farmers \n\n\f  25\n\n(iii) \n\nfrom  arbitrary  cancellation  of  land  use  certificates  and  eviction  from  farmland \nwithout due process; \nA  simplified  registration  procedure  for  businesses  in  the  project  area  shall  be \nimplemented within 3 years of the effective date, on a pilot basis and within the \nexisting legislative framework; \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Within 2 years of the effective date, the Government shall adopt a national policy, \nstrategy,  and  investment  plan  for  the  management  of  pasture  lands  and \nlivestock.

By  1997,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  had  fallen  by  about  60%  to  $175  per  capita. \nEconomic  recovery  began  in  1997  with  the  end  of  the  civil  war.  The  improved  political  and \neconomic  stability  provided  the  base  for  the  recovery,  which  further  benefited  from  favorable \nprices  for  cotton  and  aluminum,  strong  regional  economic  growth,  particularly  in  Russia,  a \nsubstantial  flow  of  remittances  from  Russia,1  and  increased  support  from  the  international \ncommunity. Agriculture and the service sector benefited most. \n \n2. \nGDP has grown by about 10% yearly since 2000, and the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) expects growth of 6% for 2006\u20132007. Inflation fell from 39% in 2001 to about 7% in 2005. \nThe  fiscal  deficit  has  remained  at  less  than  3%  of  GDP,  despite  a  significant  increase  in \ninternally funded public investment. The current account balance has remained stable at 3.8% \nof  GDP  since  2002,  despite  increased  imports.  External  debt  has  been  halved  since  2001 \nfollowing debt write-offs by Russia and Pakistan. At least 50% of Tajikistan\u2019s GDP is estimated \nto be generated by the informal sector. \n \n3. \nTajikistan has an open trade policy, with an export-to-GDP ratio of 51% in 2003. Tariffs \nare  low,  7.5%  on  average,  and  there  are  few  official  nontariff  restrictions  on  trade.  However, \nmost  goods  are  transported  through  Uzbekistan  or  Kyrgyzstan,  adding  significant  formal  and \ninformal  fees  to  the  transaction  costs  and  also  creating  uncertainty  and  instability  in  trade \nrelationships.  Cotton,  aluminum,  and  electricity  account  for  about  85%  of  exports;  the  narrow \ncommodity export base makes Tajikistan vulnerable to changes in world commodity prices. The \nGovernment  applied  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  May  2001  and  is  negotiating \naccession. \n \n4. \nDespite substantial progress, Tajikistan remains deeply poor (GDP of $311 per capita in \n2004).  The  domestic  market  is  constrained  by  a  small  population  and  low  incomes,  and  the \ncountry\u2019s  high  mountains  and  remote  location  create  formidable  barriers  to  both  internal  and \nexternal trade. Infrastructure development is difficult and expensive, although some progress is \nbeing  made  in  improving  main  national  road  links.  A  major  obstacle  to  continued  economic \nprogress is the large debt of cotton farms (about $300 million). \n \n5. \nA  weak  tax  base  (16%  of  GDP  in  2005)  inhibits  both  public  investment  in  and \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure.  Slow  and  incomplete  structural  reform  continues  to  impede \nprivate sector development, and there are significant capacity constraints in both the public and \nprivate  sectors.  High  transaction  costs  caused  by  widespread  corruption  and  inappropriate \nregulation  further  impede  the  private  sector  and  contribute  to  the  expansion  of  the  informal \nsector. \n \n6. \n Private  investment  is  inhibited  by  the  small  size  of  the  banking  sector  (total  lending  in \n2005 was only 9% of GDP, and deposits were only 4% of GDP), high interest rates, and limited \naccess to medium-term capital. \n\n                                                 \n1   Estimates  of  remittance  income  in  2004  range  from  $433  million  to  $1  billion  per  year,  equivalent  to  21\u201350%  of \n\nGDP (See International Monetary Fund 2005) Article IV Consultation with Republic of Tajikistan. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRole of Agriculture \n\nB. \n \n7. \nAgriculture  is  a  key  sector  of  the  economy,  accounting  for  24%  of  GDP,  66%  of \nemployment, 26% of exports, and 39% of tax revenue. Over 72% of the population, about four \nmillion people, depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture has accounted for one third \nof economic growth since 1997 and has thus made a major contribution to the decrease in rural \npoverty. Rural poverty incidence fell from 83% in 1999 to 64% in 2003. \n \nAgricultural land in Tajikistan covers about 4.6 million hectares (ha), made up of pasture \n8. \n(3.8 million ha), arable land (732,000 ha), and perennial crops (103,000 ha). The total irrigated \narea is about 732,000 ha, of which pump irrigation covers about 338,000 ha, or 46% of the total \nirrigated  land.  Irrigation  serves  504,000  ha  of  arable  land,  122,600  ha  of  household  plots, \n79,500  ha  of  orchards  and  vineyards,  and  25,900  ha  for  other  uses.  The  main  irrigated  crops \nare cotton, grains (wheat and corn), fruits, and vegetables. \n  \n9. \nLand reform has been continuing for several years, with land use certificates issued for \nsome  60%  of  arable  land  by  the  State  Committee  for  Land  Management  (SCLM).2  Generally, \nland  reform  has  failed  to  provide  equitable  and  secure  land-use  rights  to  farmers.  Moreover, \nambiguous  land-use  rights  have  undermined  incentives  to  produce  and  to  invest  in  land \nimprovement.  Despite  their  eligibility  by  law,  some  rural  people  have  been  denied  their  land \nrights. Local government officials have enormous latitude in interpreting land-use rights. \n  \n10. \nFarming  in  the  hills  and  mountains  enjoys  more  freedom  from  interference  by \ngovernment officials.3  Still, the rural population is compelled to follow orders issued by the local \nauthorities.  In  a  variety  of  complex  arrangements,  farmers  are  often  asked  to  produce  and \ndeliver  certain  products  or  provide  certain  services  in  return  for  being  granted  plots  of  land  or \naccess  to  a  pasture,  or  obtaining  tax  relief.  Overall,  these  arrangements  severely  dampen \nincentives and keep the farming population preoccupied primarily with their household plots and \nsubsistence farming. \n \n11. \nThe  rural  population  depends  on  household  plots  for  subsistence.  Household  plots  are \nessential  for  survival  in  the  absence  of  alternative  employment  opportunities  and  formidable \ndifficulties  in  start-ups  of  private  commercial  farming.  These  plots  are  largely  free  of  state \ninterference; farmers can choose what they produce, consume, or sell. The size of household \nplots  is  about  0.10\u20130.15  ha  for  irrigated  land,  and  about  double  that  for  nonirrigated  land, \nusually in higher-rainfall hilly and mountainous areas. Land use is intense and land productivity \nhigh.  Many  irrigated  plots  are  double-  and  sometimes  triple-cropped,  with  potatoes  and  other \ncrops  mostly  for  home  consumption  and  the  rest  (onions,  carrots,  eggplants,  cabbage, \ncauliflower,  etc.)  for  the  market.  Occasionally,  even  wheat  is  grown  on  the  household  plots \nmainly because it stores well and lasts until late winter and early spring, when poor households \ntend  to  run out  of supplies  for  themselves  and  their  livestock.  Nearly  all  household plots  have \nfruit and fuelwood trees. In addition, the plots in part sustain large and small livestock on crop \nresidue. Household plots are also by far the most productive segment of agriculture, accounting \nfor  well  over  50%  of  the  value  of  agriculture  production  on  about  12%  of  arable  land.  Various \n\n                                                 \n2  Land use certificates issued in the project area ranges from 40% in Faizobod to 72% in Rudaki. These estimates \nuse  individual  dekhan  farms  as  a  proxy,  since  all  were  granted  certificates.  Some  members  of  collective dekhan \nfarms  may  have  been  issued  certificates.  However,  there  are  major  data  inconsistencies  between  the  raion \nbranches of SCLM and the SCLM headquarters. \n\n3  For  example,  land  reform  has  been  completed  in  the  Gorno  Badakshan  Autonomous  Oblast  (GBAO),  with  all \nfarmers issued land certificates. GBAO is the most remote area in Tajikistan. Since 1992 it has been supported by \nthe Aga Khan Foundation. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35\n\nsurveys indicate that about 50% of consumption and more than 60% of household income stem \nfrom  these  plots.4  The  gross  value  of  agricultural  production  of  household  plots  is  about \nTJS2,770 ($820) per ha, which is about three times that of dekhan farms and 4.6 times higher \nthan that of old collective farms. \n \n12. \nThe  composition  of  agricultural  output  changed  substantially  after  independence, \nbecause  of  changes  in  cropping  patterns  and  a  fall  in  livestock  numbers.  The  contribution  of \ncrops  increased  from  60%  to  80%  of  gross  agricultural  output.  Crop  yields  have  increased \nsubstantially  since  1998,  although  they  remain  extremely  low  by  regional  and  international \nstandards. Political and economic stability has brought about increased use of fertilizer, which \nhas driven up yields. Still, limited access to good-quality seed (home-saved seed is used most \noften)  and  the  near  absence  of  mechanized  equipment  pose  severe  technical  constraints  on \nagriculture growth. Over 50% of farm equipment is out of order and new equipment is generally \nunaffordable.  As  a  result  of  the  limited  availability  of  mechanized  equipment,  most  agricultural \noperations  are  done  manually  and  mechanized  equipment  is  being  replaced  by  horse-drawn \nimplements. \n \n13. \nCotton is the most important crop in Tajikistan in terms of rural employment (50% of the \nlabor force) and export earnings. Exported mainly as raw fiber, it generates about 17% of export \nearnings and 11% of GDP (2004). The most significant trend in the last few years has been the \nsubstantial increase in wheat production and other food crops, which has improved nutrition and \ncontributed  to  poverty  reduction.  Crop  production  has  grown  much  faster  than  livestock \nproduction, accounting for 80% of sector growth from 1999 to 2003. Crop production has shifted \nfrom  high-value  crops  during  the  Soviet  era  to  lower-value  cereal  crops  partly  because  of  the \nlack of effective domestic and export demand, and also because of food security concerns and \na  drift  to  subsistence  farming.  Increased  cropped  areas,  especially  for  wheat,  encroach  on \nmarginal lands, aggravating soil erosion and causing long-term environmental damage. \n \nProduced  on  about  170,000  ha  of  arable  land,  fruits  and  vegetables  are  a  traditional \n14. \ndomain  of  Tajik  agriculture,  particularly  in  the  hills  and  mountains.  Over  70%  of  horticulture \noutput  (about  one  million  tons  of  fruits  and  vegetables)  is  produced  on  household  plots. \nProduction is mainly for home consumption, barter trade, and opportunistic sales. Orchards and \nvineyards  need  replacement  because  of  neglect,  infestation,  and  disease.  Postharvest  losses \nare large because of poor or even absent storage and processing facilities. The processing of \nfruits and vegetables is divided into canning and drying. The privatized industrial canning sector \ncomprises  about  32  plants,  which  are  deeply  underutilized  (utilization  is  generally  less  than \n30%)  and  obsolete.  Processing  equipment  dates  back  to  the  1930s  with  some  renovations. \nProducing juices, pickles, jams, and tomato paste, most plants have throughput of less than one \nmillion liters a year. Total production is estimated at about 45 million liters. Current margins are \nestimated  at  less  than  5%  of  gross  revenues.  Growers  try  to  avoid  industrial  processing \nbecause  of  low  prices  and  uncertain  payment.  They  prefer  small-scale  natural  sun  drying  or \nother methods. \n \n15. \nAgricultural export is limited to cotton, and fruits and vegetables. Cotton accounts for 85\u2013\n90% of agriculture exports, and fresh and processed fruit and vegetables for the remaining 10\u2013\n15%. The Russian food market is evolving quickly as consumer income grows and international \nsupermarkets expand, making it increasingly difficult for Tajik products to compete. Wheat, flour, \n\n                                                 \n4  For example, see baseline update survey under the World Bank Farm Privatization Support Project, and the Rural \nInfrastructure Rehabilitation Project, unpublished working draft, September 2003 to January 2004, Monitoring and \nEvaluation Unit, Rural Information and Advisory Services. Also, see the Tajikistan Living Standard Survey. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nand edible oils are the main food imports, but these account for less than 5% of total imports. \nMost  fertilizer,  agrochemicals,  and  fuel  are  imported  from  neighboring  countries,  and  quality \ntends to be unreliable. \n \nThe  commercial  livestock  sector  has  essentially  collapsed.  Cattle,  small  stock,  and \n16. \npoultry numbers have declined and livestock ownership has shifted to households, which own \nabout  90%  of  all  livestock,  and  are  the  dominant  suppliers  of  milk,  meat,  and  other  livestock \nproducts.  Sheep  and  cattle  numbers  have  been  recovering  slowly  since  the  Civil  War.  Goat, \nyak,  and  horse  numbers  have  been  steadily  increasing  and  now  exceed  their  numbers  at \nindependence. With the exception of pig production and remittances, cattle and sheep are the \nmain sources of income for those rural households with livestock. Livestock manure is important \nfor garden plots and dried as fuel in winter. Horses are important as a substitute for tractors. \n \n17.  Milk and meat production is low (1,000\u20131,400 kilograms [kg] per dairy cow). Low fertility \n(on  average,  50\u201355  calves  per  100  cows)  adversely  affects  milk  and  meat  production.  The \nweight of animals for meat production has declined on average by about 10\u201315%. Sheep and \ngoats suffer similar problems as cattle. Fine angora sheep reared in mountainous regions used \nto  be  highly  profitable  but  have  now  nearly  vanished.  Annual  average  wool  production  per \nsheep is stable, although total production has dropped. \n \nPoor livestock nutrition is caused mainly by the lack of suitable fodder especially in late \n18. \nwinter and early spring, and limited access to pastures throughout the year. Households have \nvery limited access to pastures, which is a major problem for them and the environment. Often \nthey cannot afford or are unwilling to pay for access to pastures controlled by dekhan farms or \nraion  officials.  They  are  forced  to  have  their  animals  graze  near  settlements,  causing \novergrazing  and  environmental  damage.  Households  control  about  10%  of  cultivated  area  for \nfodder and less than 1% of pastures, although they keep 90% of all livestock and account for \n90% of meat, 90% of milk, and 69% of egg production. Dekhan farms control about 36% of the \narea  cultivated  with  fodder  crops,  and  67%  of  pastures,  although  they  keep  less  than  6%  of \nlivestock  and  produce  2%  of  meat,  2%  of  milk,  and  less  than  1%  of  eggs.  Other  agriculture \nenterprises (e.g., state breeding farms, old collective farms) control over 54% of cultivated areas \nfor  fodder  and  about  33%  of  pastures,  although  they  keep  only  11%  of  livestock  and  produce \n8% of meat, 8% of milk, and 30% of eggs. \n \n19. \nOther major problems in the livestock sector relate to animal diseases. The capacity to \ncontrol diseases has declined considerably because of the reduced reach of veterinary services \nand the low supply of effective drugs caused in part by an inability to pay. Veterinary services \nhave  deteriorated  especially  in  the  more  remote  parts  of  the  country.  Suitable  prophylactic \nmeasures  are  neglected,  and  livestock  disease,  notably  brucellosis,  and  foot  and  mouth \ndisease, is a serious issue. \n \n20. \nLivestock  processing  plants  have  been  privatized  but  operate  at  a  fraction  of  their \ninstalled  capacity,  often  in  unsanitary  conditions  and  with  obsolete  equipment.  Farmers  try  to \navoid these facilities, selling milk directly to consumers and meat mainly through bazaars. \n \n21. \n \n\nTable A2.1 summarizes the main characteristics of farming in Tajikistan in 2005. \n\n\fIncluding irrigated land (ha) \n\n122,607 \n\n397,139 \n\nTable A2.1: Characteristics of Main Farm Categories in Tajikistan, 2005 \n\n \n\nItem \n\nNumber of farms \n\nTotal agricultural land (ha) \n\nAverage by category (ha) \n\nArable land (ha) \n\nPerennial crops (ha) \n\nArable land and perennial crops (ha) \n\nAverage by category (ha) \n\nPastures (ha) \n\nPer landowner (ha) \n\nCrop yields \n\n   Cotton (ton/ha) \n\n    Wheat (ton/ha) \n\nNumber of cattle \n\n% of total \n\nOwnership (%) \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37\n\nState and \nCollective Farms \n\nAll \nFarms \n\n1,439 \n\n24,211 \n\n  2,251,108 \n\n1,669,889 \n\n  4,644,982 \n\nHousehold \nPlots \n\n600,000a \n251,980b \n\n0.20 \n\n153,124 \n\n34,011 \n\n187,134 \n\n0.31 \n\n\u2500 \n\n\u2500 \n\n\u2500 \n\n2.17 \n\n87.1 \n\n74 \n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDekhan \nFarms \n\n18,483 \n\n21.5 \n\n465,938 \n\n59,762 \n\n525,700 \n\n28.4 \n\n32.0 \n\n1.85 \n\n1.90 \n\n3.5 \n\n6 \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n306,670 \n\n213.1 \n\n252,111 \n\n35,836 \n\n287,947 \n\n200.1 \n\n1.82 \n\n1.90 \n\n9.4 \n\n20 \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n732,411 \n\n30.25 \n\n723,672 \n\n102,628 \n\n826,300 \n\n34.12 \n\n\u2500 \n\n\u2500 \n\n100.0 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n  1,700,423 \n\n1,363,994 \n\n  3,773,181 \n\n947.8 \n\n155.84 \n\n  1,062,124 \n\n42,601 \n\n114,254 \n\n  1,218,979 \n\nNumber of sheep and goats \n\n  1,907,884 \n\n146,859 \n\n537,720 \n\n  2,592,463 \n\nGross value of agricultural production \n(TJS \u2019000) \n\nContribution by category (%) \n\nGross value of agricultural production per \nha \n\n540,267 \n\n197,483 \n\n271,119 \n\n  1,009,229 \n\n  2,771 TJS \n\n  822 TJS \n\n600 TJS \n\n  1,138 TJS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n\n51 \n\n12 \n\n100 \n\nCredit \n\nContribution to sector growth: (1999\u2013\n2003) (%) \na  Derived as rural population/family ratio. \nb  Total land area: household plots added to private land. \nSources: Goscomstat and Land Balance of Tajikistan, January 2005. \n \nC. \n \nGrowth is further constrained by limited access to credit. Most farm credit is destined for \n22. \ncotton  production.  Financing  for  this  is  channeled  to  principal  exporters  through  Credit  Invest, \nInc.,  a  specialized  financial  institution,  which  guarantees  cotton  financing  against  the  future \ncrop.  \n \nThe  size  of  the  market  for  microfinance  loans  was  evaluated  in  a  2003  study5 \n23.  \ncommissioned  and  funded  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  and  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  (CIDA).  This  study  estimated  that  the  annual  demand  for \n\n                                                 \n5  Report  on  the  Feasibility  of  Establishing  a  Microfinance  Institution  in  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan,  prepared  by \n\nBearing Point, June 2003. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmicrofinance  was  about  $100  million  and  that  this  level  of  disbursements  would  result  in  an \naverage national portfolio of about $40 million serving about 100,000 clients.  \n \nOfficial  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan  (NBT)  statistics6  show  that  the  total  level  of \n24. \nmicrofinance disbursed in Tajikistan in 2005 was TJS296 million. This is the equivalent of about \n$90  million  at  the  year-end  exchange  rates  and  supports  the  findings  of  the  2003  study. \nHowever,  the  volume  of  lending  may  have  been  larger,  as  not  all  microfinance  programs  are \nregistered with NBT. \n \n25. \nThe  NBT  figures  also  indicate  that  TJS296  million  of  microfinance  lending  represented \n55,000  loans.  This  suggests  an  average  loan  size  of  TJS5,380.  The  majority  of  microcredit  is \nlent  for  livestock  (43%),  followed  by  small  trade  (24%),  crops  (18%),  small  and  medium \nenterprises (8%), and other agricultural activities (7%). \n \n\n                                                 \n6  NBT Bulletin \u2013 Vestnik, No. 1/2, 2006. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE SECTOR  \nas of June 2006 \n\nFunding \nSource \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \n\nProject \n\n1. \n2. \n\n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\nSustainable Cotton Subsector Project \nSupport for Monitoring Policy Reforms and \nImproving Farm and Water Management \n\nAgriculture Rehabilitation \nIrrigation Rehabilitation Project \nRural Development Project \nTechnical Assistance on Farm Analysis and    \nAwareness Raising, Farm Debt Resolution \n\nCommunity-Based Agriculture Sector \nDevelopment for Tajikistan \n\nPro-Poor Agricultural Development in Northern      \nTajikistan \nMonitoring of Progress on Land Reform in \nTajikistan through Establishment of a Participatory \nMonitoring System \n\n10.

From  this  total,  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  is  requesting  an  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  IX  Grant  allocation  of  $8.3  million  to  finance  the  following: \ninternational and national consultants to undertake the national pasture land sector assessment \nand  associated  international  and  national  workshops;  the  contracting  of  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  to  develop  agricultural  and  rural  business  advisory  services;  selected \nequipment and vehicles to support project implementation; and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nA. \n \nFiscal  Weakness  and  Narrow  Economic  Base.  At  the  macro  level,  the  country  has \n2. \naccumulated a massive external debt. Despite improvements in managing the fiscal deficit, the \nGovernment  faces  significant  structural  impediments  that  limit  its  capacity  to  invest  in  basic \nsocial  services  and  infrastructure  and  prevent  the  country  from  initiating  poverty-reducing \nmeasures.  One  major  structural  bottleneck  is  its  limited  revenue  sources.  The  Government \nrelies mainly on its narrow export base (aluminum, cotton, and hydropower) for tax receipts. In \npast  years,  the  cotton  subsector  alone  generated  about  35%  of  tax  revenues.  For  the \nGovernment to address its fiscal situation there is need for the economy to diversify its income-\ngenerating activities and improve the performance of its revenue sources. \n \n3. \nFarmers  and  business  entrepreneurs  have  limited  freedom  to  engage  in  commercial \nfarming  and  rural  business  because  of  the  restricted  enabling  environment.  Most  people  have \nnot  been  adequately  informed  of  their  rights  and  are  dissatisfied  with  the  allocation  and \ndemarcation  of  land  parcels.  In  addition,  authorities  can  take  and  reallocate  land  if  it  is \nconsidered  to  be  used  improperly  or  irrationally.  Moreover,  farmers  are  subject  to  extensive \nadministrative  interference  in  making  production  and  marketing  decisions.  This  creates  a  high \nlevel  of  insecurity  among  the  population  with  respect  to  land-use  rights  and  discourages \ninvestments in land and farming. \n \n4. \nThe  business  environment  is  influenced  by  the  variable  conditions  caused  by  differing \ninterpretations of national legislation and a lack of knowledge on the part of local officials, which \nresult  in  unpredictable  behavior  by  local  government  officials  and  a  lack  of  incentives  for \npotential  farming  and  business  entrepreneurs  to  invest  and  conduct  commercial  business.  A \nmore  favorable  business  environment  is  essential  to  the  development  of  small  and  medium \nenterprises to deliver input supplies, rural services, storage, processing, equipment dealerships, \nfinancial services, and other activities for an emerging market economy.  \n \n5. \nExtensive  Land  Degradation.  The  largest  category  of  land  in  Tajikistan  is  grassland. \nPasture  management  and  livestock  production  systems  have  collapsed  and  social  and \neconomic  conditions  have  changed  dramatically.  Livestock  are  a  key  component  of  most \nhouseholds\u2019 livelihood strategies, with about 90% of cattle owned by households. The sector is \ncharacterized by complex tenure systems and has been effectively bypassed by land reform. In \naddition,  about  50%  of  forest  land  is  also  considered  to  be  under  pasture,  and  a  policy  on \nforestland  management  has  been  formulated.  There  is  a  need  to  reorient  forest  management \ntoward  the  changing  needs  of  local  communities,  toward  comanagement  of  woodlots  and \nshelterbelts,  better  coordination  of  forest  management  and  grazing  inside  and  outside  forest \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nfor \n\nrequirements \n\nlands,  and  more  active  promotion  of  on-farm  and  household  tree  planting.1  It  is  necessary  to \ndemonstrate  land  improvement  techniques  and  measures  to  address  this  land  degradation, \nwhich occurs in a variety of conditions. \n \nFarmers  and  rural  businesses  lack  professional  agriculture  and  business  support \n6. \nservices  and  are  disempowered  as  a  result.  Such  services  are  currently  being  provided  by  a \nnumber of NGOs and institutes. An approach is needed to provide services in a flexible manner \nto meet the needs of farmers without generating the high overhead costs associated with formal \nrecurrent \ninstitutional  arrangements  and  without  creating  additional \ngovernment expenditure.  \n \n7. \nMarket information is crucial to decision making by farmers and business entrepreneurs. \nAt present, while some information exists, it is not timely, often irregular, and not available to a \nwide  audience.  The  aim  will  be  to  build  a  network  that  will  collect,  analyze,  and  disseminate \nmarket information in a form that can be used by advisers, farmers, and entrepreneurs. \n \nEconomic Infrastructure in Disrepair. Road and bridges need rehabilitation to provide \n8. \nmore  reliable  and  improved  access  to  markets  and  services,  irrigation  systems  require  major \nrepair,  drinking  water  is  often  inaccessible,  and  electricity  supply  is  constantly  disrupted, \nparticularly in winter.  \n \n9. \nWeak  National  and  Local  Institutions.  All  central  government  institutions  are \nhampered by lack of financial resources: their budgets cannot cover much more than salaries. \nSimilar  difficulties  exist  at  raion  and  jamoat  levels.  Skills  in  planning,  particularly  involving \ninterrelationships  between  different  parts  of  the  economy  are  lacking.  Clear  accountability  for \nperformance is absent, and controls on performance are based on perceptions of results by the \nraion governor. The budgeting process does not allow for longer-term financial planning. \n \nB.  \n \n10. \n \nThe ADF IX grant will finance the participation of international and national consultants, \n11. \nwho  will  provide  services  to  increase  land  use  security.  They  will  undertake  the  nationwide \npasture land management study; assess and develop more streamlined registration procedures \nfor farms and businesses in rural areas; establish, through NGO contracts, agriculture and rural \nadvisory  service  centers  and  a  management  information  system;  support  the  design  and \nsupervision  of  raion  and  community  infrastructure  and  provide  capacity  development  in  the \nplanning  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure;  and  provide  further  technical,  accounting,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation staff for effective project implementation. \n \n12. \nThe ADF IX grant will also provide vehicles and equipment to support the pasture land \nstudy,  sector  assessment  demonstrations  of  improved  pasture  land  management,  and  the \nproject management unit. \n\nA summary of the cost estimates for the grant is provided in the table.  \n\nProposed Activities \n\n                                                 \n1   Central  Asian  Countries  Initiative  on  Land  Management  (CACILM).  2005.

Lack \nof  local  capacity,  particularly  in  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  means  that  a  higher  than  normal \nlevel  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  national  consultants  in  supporting  roles  will  be \nrequired.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified \nas  a  national  priority  in \ncountry \npoverty \nanalysis?  \n\n \n\n  Yes  \n\n    No  \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority  in  country  poverty  partnership \nagreement?1 \n\n \n\n Yes  \n\n  No  \n\nThe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP 2002) provides the Government\u2019s coordinated framework for addressing \npoverty in Tajikistan. Rural development plays a critical role in reducing poverty by generating a widespread increase in \nfarm  incomes  and  creating  opportunities  for  growth  in  rural  services  and  industry.  To  be  successful,  the  poverty \nstrategy  for  the  sector  should  address  three  areas:  (a)  efficient  use  of,  and  access  of  the  poor  to,  key  resources,  in \nparticular  land  and  water;  (b)  creation  of  a  favorable  framework  for  developing  private  activity  in  the  sector;  and \n(c) reform of the management system in the sector, including intervention in decision making by the private sector. In its \n(draft) National Development Strategy (2006), the Government, while reiterating the critical role of rural development, \nquestions the  efficiency  of  land reform, as  producers (especially those involved in cotton) do  not  exercise full control \nover  production,  sales,  and  land  rights  in  general;  ownership  of  land  in  private  farms  remains  collectivized, \nexacerbating  ineffective  land  use;  and  most  of  the  rural  infrastructure  (rural  roads,  irrigation  systems)  does  not  have \nproper  owners  and  is  not  properly  maintained.  Deteriorating  infrastructure  further  hinders  agricultural  production  with \ndirect impact on poverty reduction. \n\nThe  project  area  covers  about  8,350  square  kilometers  with  a  rural  population  of  552,100  in  five  raions:  Faizobod, \nRoghun,  Rudaki,  Vahdat,  and  Varzob.  This  area  accounts  for  about  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  official  gross  development \nproduct (GDP), 77% of which originates in agriculture. Dependent largely on subsistence agriculture, the people have \nfew business and employment opportunities. Many seek seasonal casual work opportunities abroad, mainly in Russia. \nFarmland  and  pastures  are  the  main  productive  resources.  The  project  area  population  relies  on  agriculture, \nmiscellaneous petty trade, and foreign remittances for their livelihood.  \n\nThere  is  no  official  poverty  line  for  Tajikistan,  but  income  poverty  is  widespread  and  severe  in  the  countryside, \nespecially in the cotton-growing areas. According to the Tajikistan Living Standards Survey, which relies on the World \nBank threshold of $2.15/person/day, absolute poverty was 81% in 1999 and declined to 63% in 2003.  Poverty is more \nprevalent  in  rural  areas,  where  over  84%  of  all  households  in  1999  and  68%  in  2003  were  estimated  to  be  living  in \nrelative poverty. In the five project raions, which are in the Regions of Republican Subordination (RRS), relative poverty \nrates are lower than in other predominantly rural regions. The relative poverty rate was 73% in 1999 and 55% in 2003, \nand is about 45% in 2006. Urban poverty rates are lower: the overall poverty rate for the Dushanbe region was 69% in \n1999 and 49% in 2003, and is about 40% in 2006. These estimates are in sharp contrast to those provided by the five \nproject  raions,  which  show  an  overall  relative  poverty  rate  of  67%,  varying  from  a  high  of  76%  in  Roghun  (with  the \nsmallest  percentage,  at  46%,  engaged  in  agricultural  employment)  to  a  low  of  58%  in  Faizobod  (with  the  largest \npercentage, at 82%, engaged in agricultural employment). Agro-ecological factors and distance from Dushanbe could \npartly explain these differences, but raions closer to Dushanbe (e.g., Vahdat, with a higher estimated GDP per capita of \nTJS460) are, according to local raion estimates, poorer (66% relative poverty rate). It should also be stressed that non-\nincome-related  aspects  of  poverty,  especially  those  relating  to  health  (reproductive  health  indicators  have  seen  an \nincrease in infant mortality rate), sanitation (access to potable water is problematic), and education (participation rates \nfor girls in secondary education have fallen), have also affected the poor, with greatest impact on women and girls. \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                               Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nPoverty statistics nationwide indicate that the incidence of poverty is decreasing and this is also indicated in the project \npreparatory technical assistance Socioeconomic Survey, although the findings of this survey demonstrate there are at \nleast 20% of households living in absolute poverty and another 20% living in relative poverty (slightly less in total than \nthe  estimated  45%  for  the  RRS  region).  During  a  series  of  participatory  rural  appraisals  facilitated  by  the  TA,  poorer \nhouseholds  generally  prioritized  agricultural-type  interventions  lower  than  those  associated  with  improved  access  to \nwater, non-agricultural-based income generation opportunities, access to affordable sources of credit, and a reduction \nin  the  cost  of  access  to  health  services.  In  relation  to  agricultural-type  interventions,  the  emphasis  was  on  access  to \nimproved seed varieties and better knowledge of cropping techniques to increase productivity on household plots. \n \nIn  the  project  area,  the  poor  and  vulnerable  are  relatively  easy  to  identify.  The  major  indicators  are  lack  of  livestock, \nlimited or no access to arable land apart from household plots either through use rights (land certificates) or ability to \nrent  portions  of  land,  poor  diet  (lack  of  meat  on  a  regular  basis  and  limited  consumption  of  dairy  products),  inferior \n                                                 \n\n1   Tajikistan adopted its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP 2002), and is finalizing its PRSP Realization Report \n\n(2002\u20132006). It concluded a Poverty Partnership Agreement with ADB in December 2002. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\nhousing, children\u2019s inability to complete secondary schooling, inability to finance male household members to work in \nother  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS)  countries,  households  with  fixed  incomes  (including  the  grossly \ninadequate pensions paid to older or invalid persons), and high dependency ratios (older people or younger children). \nAmong the better-off households in the project raions are those who have been able to preserve their asset bases from \npre-independence times and have resisted pressure from local raion authorities to make investment decisions on their \nbehalf. Also among the better-off households are those such as the managers of cooperative dekhan farms who have \nbeen  able  to  garner  the  assets  of  former  collectives  (i.e.,  land,  buildings,  or  equipment)  for  their  own  use.  Still  other \nbetter-off households are those where at least one or two household members are working in other CIS countries and \ncan regularly repatriate earnings, although much of these earnings are used for household-based consumption. \n \nThe causes of poverty were generally defined as lack of water for irrigation in the valley areas (and to some extent in \nupland areas such as in Varzob) and lack of drinking water everywhere (especially during winter and summer), lack of \naccess  to  land  whether  it  is  household  plots  of  private  dekhan  farms,  and  a  lack  of  non-agricultural-based  income \ngeneration opportunities. The very poor believe that if they had access to water to grow two household crops per year \ntheir food security would improve their livelihoods dramatically. Similarly, access to potable drinking water would reduce \nthe  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  and  ease  the  burden  on  women  and  girls,  who  are  primarily  responsible  for \nmanaging domestic water resources. The opportunity to become an effective private dekhan farmer\u2014defined as being \nindependent  to  farm  freely  without  interference  from  local  raion  authorities\u2014also  features  prominently  but  is  not \nconsidered  as  a  realistic  option  by  the  poor.  Poorer  women  are  generally  more  interested  in  nonfarm  income \ngeneration opportunities such as baking and weaving, skills that many currently possess but are unable to derive any \nincome from. For the very poor then, off-farm or nonfarm income generation opportunities are valued over farm-based \nincome generation activities. \n \nThe design of the Project addresses the major causes of poverty. Insecure or no access to arable land for the very poor \nis  caused  by  the  non-transparent  and  inequitable  allocation  of  such  land.  The  Project  will  include  raising  public \nawareness of land reform, accelerating the transition to individual farming, expediting the process of obtaining properly \nregistered  land  certificates,  limiting  local  government  to  a  reduced  but  more  transparent  role  in  land  reform,  and \nsupporting  ongoing  processes  developed  by  other  international  donors.  Pasture  land  tenure  reform  will  provide  the \npeople  with  an  opportunity  to  more  effectively  graze  their  livestock  on  pasture  lands,  resulting  in  significant \nimprovements in their individual livestock. \n \nPoorer  households  will  also  benefit  from  an  improved  rural  business  environment  whereby  they  will  have  the \nopportunity  to  finance  micro  and  small  nonfarm  business  enterprises  within  a  facilitation  framework  with  a  range  of \nnonfarm  rural  business  advisory  services  on  a  fee-for-service  basis  (including  development  of  business  plans)  and \nmarket  intelligence.  Rural  infrastructure  improvements  designed  to  rehabilitate  small-scale  public  infrastructure  (e.g., \nroad  or  bridge  access,  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  drinking  water  supplies,  and  electricity  generation  and \ndistribution)  will  benefit  all  people,  including  those  living  in  poverty,  and  the  latter  will  also  benefit  from  seasonal \nemployment to make such improvements. The community infrastructure improvements will be demand-driven although \nwithin a broad context designed to improve the physical capital of the local community. Apart from being pro-poor, the \ndesign of the Project also reflects a pro-gender approach. Women will need to derive opportunities and benefits on an \nequal basis with men.  \n \nThe livelihood improvements envisaged in the project raions will benefit about 30,000 poor households, of which about \n15,000 are living in absolute poverty. Improved land tenure security will benefit about 7,000 households and generate a \n30% increase in household income. Pasture land tenure reform will allow at least 2,000 households to graze at least \n16,000 livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) on better-managed pastures, resulting in better-quality livestock. About 10% \nof poor households will be able to access and benefit from agricultural and rural business advisory services, resulting in \nthe establishment of small business enterprises and the creation of income generation opportunities for the poor. Raion \ninfrastructure development will create local paid employment for poorer beneficiaries. \n \nIndirect  benefits  will  include  increased  opportunities  and  status  for  the  poor,  especially  women  and  ethnic  minority \ngroups where relevant, because of diminished opportunities for local raion authorities to persist with anti-poor practices \nassociated with unreasonable interference in the economic and social lives of the population, including the poor. It will \nalso  be  possible  to  address  intra-household  gender  inequities  that  disempower  women,  by  allowing  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  women\u2019s  priorities  to  be  accorded  the  same  level  of  priority  as  those  of  men  (e.g.,  community \ninfrastructure improvements). \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA series of participatory stakeholder consultations involving women and men and ethnic minority groups were facilitated \nin  a  range  of  jamoats  reflecting  the  different  agro-ecological  and  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  five  project  raions. \nLocal  jamoat  and  raion  officials  were  also  consulted.  Secondary  stakeholders  included  civil  society  groups  actively \ninvolved in the project raions and for whom the Project might seek to enter into a partnership with to effect synergies \nwith  existing  programs  or  projects.  These  consultations  also  included  international  development  partners  undertaking \ntheir  own  projects  in  the  project  raions.  With  primary  stakeholders  at  the  village  level,  consultations  focused  on  the \n\n  Yes               \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nmeaning  of  poverty  (its  causes  and  effects),  realistic  livelihood  improvements,  nonfarm  income  generation  activities, \npolitical  interference  from  local  raion  authorities,  problems  associated  with  labor  migration  to  CIS  countries,  and \nactivities of NGOs. With local raion authorities, the consultations related more to technical considerations such as the \nreliability of local data, problems associated with access to pasture land, assessment of NGOs, and their thoughts on \nrevisiting land allocation.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe Project\u2019s participation strategy will focus on ensuring the involvement of all project beneficiaries, including the poor, \nwomen, and other vulnerable groups (including ethnic minorities), in all phases of project design, implementation, and \nmonitoring.  Both  participatory  processes  and  local  rural  institutions  that  are  socially  inclusive  (e.g.,  the  sozmoni \nmardumi, or village organization)  will be used to carry out these participatory approaches. The processes  will include \n(i) participatory land allocation processes in local communities where this is deemed necessary; (ii) outreach strategies \nfor the agriculture and rural business advisory services targeted at potential clients that are sufficiently pro-poor but also \ndemand-driven; (iii) a participatory and community-based monitoring and evaluation mechanism and processes aimed \nat  strengthening  the  pro-poor  aspects  of  the  Project;  and  (iv)  stakeholder  consultations  involving  local  communities, \nraion  authorities,  relevant  government  agencies,  independent  research  institutions,  civil  society  groups,  and  the \ndevelopment community.  This strategy is reflected in the participation plan that has been prepared.  \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\nD.  Gender and Development \n\n \nIn  the  first  few  years  of  post-Soviet  independence,  large  numbers  of  people  were  forced  to  become  subsistence \nfarmers or at least rural dwellers relying on their household plots to meet basic household food security needs. The civil \nwar and the continuous seasonal male-out migration to other CIS countries contributed to women\u2019s increasing role and \nvisibility in the agricultural sector. Not only do 27% more  women than men work in the agriculture sector, but women \nalso  rely  more  for  survival  on  produce  from  personal  land  plots  (108  women  for  every  100  men).  Women  tend  to \nprovide seasonal unskilled and poorly paid labor during planting and harvesting. These women receive extremely low \nwages that are often not paid regularly or are made \u201cin kind,\u201d putting further pressure on their livelihood. Women do not \nhave  access  to  higher-paid  jobs  that  require  the  operation  of  machinery,  as  this  is  still  considered  to  be  the  men\u2019s \ndomain.  Few  women  have  formal  training  in  the  agriculture  sector,  but  many  have  long  experience  working  on \ncollective  farms  (sometimes  in  positions  of  responsibility)  or  may  be  highly  educated,  with  skills  from  previous \nnonagricultural employment. Despite the experience women have been gaining in recent years in this sector, they are \ncommonly portrayed as unskilled agricultural workers or as contributing only unpaid family labor to household plots. In \nthe  project  areas,  critical  issues  affecting  the  status  of  women  as  identified  by  women  include:  (i)  lack  of  access  to \ncheap inputs for improving the productivity of their household plots; (ii) limited opportunities to secure access to private \ndekhan  farms;  (iii)  disproportionate  representation  as  members  of  largely  nonperforming  cooperative  dekhan  farms; \n(iv) pivotal role in food production because of the absence of adult males, who are working in CIS countries; (v) lack of \naccess to livestock for the very poor; (vi) lack of access to off-farm income generation activities; (vii) lack of access to \naffordable sources of credit; and (viii) lack of free time compared with men, because of the need to juggle household \nactivities with food production and other income generation activities. \n \nDuring project preparation, a detailed social and gender analysis was carried out by the TA consultants. On the basis of \nthe  potential  gender  impact  of  the  Project,  a  Project-specific  gender  action  plan  has  been  developed,  through \nconsultations at the central and raion level, to ensure the equal participation of male and female stakeholders as agents \nand beneficiaries in the proposed loan. \n \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n61\n\nE.

Given the \npossibility of minor land acquisition with respect to the \nconstruction or rehabilitation of community and raion \ninfrastructure, and the likelihood of impact on \nproductive assets, particularly agricultural land through \nirrigation rehabilitation, a resettlement framework or \nshort resettlement plan is required. When subprojects \nare designed and impacts identified, a resettlement \nplan will be prepared according to the resettlement \nframework.  \nProject interventions will not reduce the financial \nburden on farmers with respect to water user fees, but \nwill help ensure that fees are used for their correct \npurpose and not to meet general budget shortfalls. \nGreater participation of farmers in operation and \nmaintenance will reduce costs, and could provide \nsome additional income for poor farmers. \n \nAs a condition for the financing of raion infrastructure \nprojects, raion authorities will be required to give \npreference to poor households for unskilled and \nsemiskilled work in project implementation. Contract \ndocuments will be made up in compliance with the \ncountry\u2019s labor legislation (e.g., minimum wages, safe \nworking conditions). \n \nNon-Tajik ethnic minority groups are present in the \nproject area. The major ethnic minority is the ethnic \nUzbek group. These populations do not face \ndiscrimination and are not considered vulnerable. \nNevertheless, specific actions for ethnic minorities \nhave been prepared to ensure that they benefit \nproportionally from the Project. \n \nIn the five project raions there is a strong possibility \nthat raion authorities will actively interfere with all or \nmost activities planned by the Project, whether this \nrelates to the actual allocation of land, issuance of \nland certificates, business enterprise development, or \ncommunity infrastructure development. The \nparticipation plan is designed to curb such practices. \nSafeguard policies and mitigation measures will be \nmonitored as part of project performance monitoring to \nminimize risks. \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n Yes \n \n  No \n\n Yes \n \n  No \n\nCIS = Commonwealth of Independent States; NGO = nongovernment organization; RRS = Regions of Republican \nSubordination \n \n\nResettlement  \n\nAffordability  \n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous Peoples  \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Rural Development Project will improve the living standards of rural communities in \n1. \nthe  project  raions  by  improving  land  tenure  security  for  individual  households,  carrying  out  a \nseries  of  rural  development  initiatives  associated  with  both  farm  and  nonfarm  business \ndevelopment,  instituting  more  rational  use  of  pasture  lands,  providing  easier  access  to \nmicrocredit, and implementing small infrastructure improvements of a demand-driven nature. To \nachieve all this, the Project has four main components: (i) policy and institutional development \nand reform; (ii) sustainable land management (pasture, arable, and forest);  (iii) agricultural and \nrural business support; (iv) rural infrastructure development; and (v) project management. \n \n2. \nThe rehabilitation and improvement of small-scale irrigation and drainage systems, rural \nwater  supply  systems,  and  intra-raion  roads  in  the  Project  will  have  potentially  very  limited \ninvoluntary resettlement impact. However, because all small-scale infrastructure improvements \nin  the  raions  and  the  communities  are  fully  demand-driven,  safeguards  must  be  provided  for \neven limited involuntary resettlement impact via this resettlement framework. \n \n3. \nAll  land  in  Tajikistan  is  state-owned  and  the  Land  Code  states  that  land  must  be \neffectively used to the benefit of the people (article 2 of the Land Code). Land use is directed by \nthe  State  through  the  local  raion  administrations,  specifically  the  local  offices  of  the  State \nCommittee  for  Land  Management  and  raion  administrative  offices  (hukumat),  although  an \nunderlying objective of the Project is to ensure that land use (especially what is cultivated) is a \ndecision of individual landholders rather than the State. Inheritance land-use rights are provided \nfor in the Constitution (article 13) and the Land Code (article 12), but the process is still at a very \nearly  stage  of  implementation  and  does  not  provide  women  with  rights  and  opportunities  for \ninheritance or reimbursement of land share when getting married or divorced. The Land Code \naddresses  potential  compensation  for  people  who  legally  occupy  government  land  and  are \nforced to relocate (article 15) but does not address compensation for people illegally occupying \ngovernment land and forced to relocate, nor does it address compensation for people who have \nentered into \u201cinformal\u201d renting or leasing arrangements with legally recognized land certificates. \n \n4. \nA  number  of  raion  infrastructure  projects  that  will  benefit  agriculture  were  identified  for \nfinancing  under  the  Project.  These  include  minor  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  systems,  and  the \nrehabilitation  of  jamoat-to-raion  roads.  Community  infrastructure  projects  that  have  been \nidentified  include  water  supply  system  (one  of  which  is  gravity-fed  and  transects  several \ndifferent local communities), a prototype veterinary clinic, and a typical vegetable market. Pre-\nfeasibility studies have not been carried out on any of these proposed projects, and at this stage \nit is not possible to state with absolute certainty that there will not be any resettlement issues. \nHowever, no major resettlement issues are expected, although the minor rehabilitation works on \nirrigation systems could affect the people who now use the land within 5 meters of the irrigation \ncanal (they are permitted to do so on the understanding that the land will revert to the irrigation \nsystem). \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  pre-identified  infrastructure  projects  in  the  raions  and  communities  do  not  involve \nland  acquisition  or  resettlement.  However,  in  the  light  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \npractices  of  some  raion  authorities  in  the  past,  affected  households  must  be  given  adequate \ncompensation for loss of cultivated land or of housing as a result of the Project. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n63\n\nfinanced  by \n\ntechnical  assistance  (TA) \n\nIrrigation  Rehabilitation  Project \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\nC. \n \n6. \nThe  Tajikistan  Land  Code  (article  48)  states  that  if  land  is  taken  from  a  physical  and \njuridical or legal person for state and public needs, those persons will be apportioned the same \nvalue of land, and losses, including income, will be fully compensated. During the preparation of \nthe \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the chief of the Department of International Relations at Tajikistan\u2019s \nState Committee for Land Management stated that the local raion authorities could compensate \npeople  who  are  forced  to  relocate,  but  only  for  loss  of  cultivated  land  (pasture  land  was  not \nmentioned, but relocation is assumed not to take place outside the village) and not for the loss \nof housing or other built structures. The short resettlement plan prepared as part of that TA was \nthe  result  of  extensive  discussions  with  local  raion  authorities  to  clarify  this  matter.  Similarly \nunder  the  TA  for  the  Project,  extensive  discussions  were  undertaken  with  the  local  raion \nauthorities in each of the five project raions. In the most unlikely event that households lose land \nor are forced to relocate, the households will receive full and complete compensation. \n \nThe ADB Policy on Involuntary Resettlement addresses \u201closses of land, resources, and \n7. \nmeans of livelihood or social support systems, which people suffer as a result of ADB projects.\u201d \nThe Project is unlikely to cause any population displacement, but a few households, especially \namong  those  with  no  access  to  other  sources  of  land  (at  present  approximately  90%  of \nhouseholds  are  in  this  category),  might  lose  access  to  a  portion  of  the  land  from  which  they \nderive  a  very  important  source  of  their  livelihood.  This  is  a  global  estimate,  however,  and \nobviously none of the infrastructure projects will affect this number of households. Nevertheless, \nthe resettlement framework ensures that those whose lives and incomes may be affected will be \nassisted  to  ensure  that  they  have  at  least  the  same  (but  ideally,  better)  level  of  material  well-\nbeing after the Project as they did before it. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nBecause affected people have not been identified, there have been no discussions with \nsuch  people.  However,  the  TA  team  held  discussions  with  people  who  have  been  affected  by \nthe  resettlement  practices  of  local  raion  authorities  in  Varzob,  with  local  people  likely  to  be \naffected by attempts at resettlement by local raion authorities in Faizobod, and people who will \nbe affected by hydropower dam construction in Rogun. The Project will need to learn from such \nlessons  and  avoid  repeating  any  mistakes.  Discussions  were  also  held  with  local  raion \nauthorities in the five project raions and at the national level with the State Committee for Land \nManagement and the Ministry of Agriculture in Dushanbe. \n \n9. \nAll  parties  to  the  discussions  have  agreed  in  principle  to  ensure  the  welfare  of  any \npotentially-affected households. Local raion authorities in the five project raions will address the \nappeals  of  any  persons  affected  by  raion  infrastructure  development  projects.  It  has  been \nagreed  that  affected  persons  may  appoint  a  mediator  or  facilitator,  who  will  be  paid  by  local \nraion authorities, to mediate or facilitate on their behalf. Moreover, the project management unit \n(PMU) will have the services of a gender and social development specialist, who will ensure that \nany  people  who  are  affected  are  compensated  according  to  the  principles  of  this resettlement \nframework. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nThere  are  three  key  elements  related  to  compensation,  relocation,  and  income \nrestoration. First, local raion authorities have agreed to provide land of equal or better quality, in \n\nCompensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nfor \n\nraion \n\nPlanning, \n\nimplementation, \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\ninspection,  and  assessment \n\ncompensation for their potential loss of livelihood. Second, local  raion authorities have agreed \nthat during the construction of infrastructure projects, affected people will be accorded priority in \nemployment  where  possible.  However,  the  local  raion  authorities  are  not  in  a  position  to  offer \nfuture employment to affected people and argue that income restoration will need to be linked to \nthe provision of land of equal or better quality. It is, of course, the stated preference of the five \nraion authorities to avoid loss of land. \n \n11. \nThe  five  raion  authorities  have  stated  that  they  do  not  wish  to  invest  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment  projects  leading  to  housing  relocation.  To  this  end,  they  have  instructed  or  will \ninstruct technical specialists to design projects in such a way that housing relocation will not be \nnecessary.  At  the  local community  level,  local  communities  will  be  informed  that  infrastructure \ndevelopment  projects  must  not  result  in  the  loss  of  land  or  the  relocation  of  houses  unless \nindividual households (and all adult household members) agree to the acquisition of a portion of \ntheir  land  or  house,  or  the  relocation  of  other  built  structures  (e.g.,  hay  barn  or  cattle  shed). \nWhere  such  loss  of  land  or  relocation  of  houses  or  other  built  structures  occurs,  the  same \nprinciples in relation to compensation, relocation, and income restoration will need to apply. \n \nF. \n \n12. \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment projects will be the joint responsibility of the local raion authorities and the PMU in \nconsultation with jamoat and community-based groups. The PMU would also provide oversight \nof  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  framework.  Dissemination  of  information  and  any \nnecessary  public  discussions  with  affected  people  would  also  be  undertaken  periodically  to \nensure proper implementation of the resettlement framework. Before local communities call for \nproposals  for  infrastructure  development  projects  to  be  financed  by  the  Project,  information \nabout this resettlement framework will be disseminated by the PMU. Resettlement plans will be \nprepared according to the resettlement framework.  \n \nG. \n \n13. \nFor  households  that  lose  access  to  land  because  of  raion  investments,  local  raion \nauthorities  need  to  ensure  that  replacement  land  will  be  provided  and  that  households  will \nreceive land-use rights on this land. Households in a similar position as a result of community \ninfrastructure investments will need to be provided with replacement land and receive land-use \nrights.  Because  local  raion  authorities  are  responsible  for  issuing  land-use  rights  certificates, \nthey will also need to be involved. There will be minor costs involved in monitoring and providing \nsupport for resettlement, and these costs, as well as any unforeseen costs, will be covered by \nthe Project. \n \nH. \n \n14. \nAny detailed planning and implementation of resettlement would take place well before \nthe start of civil works construction. According to the Project Implementation Schedule, activities \nassociated with the first tranche for the improvements in raion and community infrastructure are \nscheduled to begin in 2007. Subject to project conditions being met, the second tranche will be \nreleased  in  2009  and  the  third  in  2011.  Each  cycle  of  infrastructure  improvement  projects  is \nexpected to take about 2 years. \n \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n65\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nI. \n \n15. \nThe PMU will implement a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan for the entire Project, \nincluding preparation, implementation, and flow-on effects. In relation to resettlement, the PMU \nwill  develop  baseline  data  for  monitoring  indicators  including:  amount  of  land  lost;  amount  of \nreplacement  land  (of  similar  or  better  quality);  number  of  jobs  provided  (temporary  and \nreplacement); compensation payments; and other assistance in moving, training, and household \nincome (or agricultural income or output value) tracking. In support of these activities, affected \npersons will be invited to attend public meetings to discuss resettlement issues.
