The Plain is one of \nthe  most  important  grain  production  areas  in  the  PRC.  Supporting  rich \nbiological  diversity,  which  includes  23  species  listed  in  the  World \nConservation Union as globally threatened, the wetlands in the Sanjiang \nPlain are some of the most species-rich and endemic-rich ecosystems in \nAsia. However, the wetlands and forestlands have shrunk to one fifth of \ntheir  original  size  in  the  last  five  decades  because  of  increasing \npopulation  and  grain  production,  and  flora  and  fauna  in  the  wetland \nnature  reserves  (NRs)  are  threatened  by  farmland  encroachment  and \nwater  resource  exploitation.  To  protect \nthese  ecosystems  while \nsupporting the sustainable development of the area, the Project adopts a \nholistic model framework of watershed management by (i) rehabilitating \nand  protecting  degraded  forests  in  the  upper  watershed  areas,  (ii) \nrestoring  and  protecting  wetlands  NRs  in  the  downstream  areas,  (iii) \nproviding  alternative  livelihood  to  farmers,  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \ncapacities  of  local  agencies  in  charge  of  watershed  wetland  and  NRs \nmanagement.  By  developing  and  pilot-testing  a  model  framework  to \nprotect wetland biodiversity while promoting the sustainable development \nof  the  areas,  the  Project  will  be  instrumental  in  establishing  a  wetland \nprotection  program \nthat  protects  wildlife  biodiversity \neffectively  and  generates  employment  and  income  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. \n  \nIn the PRC, the Sanjiang Plain wetlands are one of the richest areas with \nglobally  significant  flora  and  fauna,  which  are  mostly  concentrated  in \nNRs.  However,  over  time,  they  have  lost  their  self-cleaning  and \ngeneration  capacity  with  a  resultant  decline  in  plant  and  animal \nbiodiversity  of  global  significance.  Further,  the  wetlands'  biodiversity  is \nunder  constant \nlocal  communities  exploiting  biological \nresources for their livelihood through unsustainable farming practices at \nNRs,  and  the  limited  management  capacity  of  NR  staff.  Recent \ngovernment  policies  and  plans  are  aimed  at  halting  and  reversing \nenvironmental  degradation  in  the  area.  However,  the  policies  need \nimprovement  to  achieve  a  \u201cmodel\u201d  for  sustainable  management  of  the \nwetland  ecosystem  as  part  of  an  integrated  river-basin  management \npolicy.  Heilongjiang  is  designated  as  one  of  the  three  environmental \nprovinces in the PRC, and the provincial government (HPG) is looking for \nintegrate  watershed  and  wetland \ndevelopment  opportunities \n\nthreat  by \n\nthe  PRC \n\nthat \n\nin \n\n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\nProject \nDescription \n \n\nRationale \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjectives  \n \n\nCost Estimates \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nthe  Sanjiang  Plain  wetlands  and \n\nmanagement in a sustainable way and that can be replicated throughout \nthe  Sanjiang  wetland  NRs  and  other  areas  with  similar  environmental \nconditions.  The  proposed  Project  will  adopt  integrated  watershed \nmanagement  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  for  wetland  and  forest  conservation, \nbased  on  their  potential  to  support  ecologically  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. It will provide a model framework that can be expanded for \ncomprehensive,  longer-term  management  of  wetlands  and  biodiversity \non a large river-basin scale. \n \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  of  natural \nresources  to  protect  globally  significant  biodiversity  and  to  promote \neconomic development. The immediate objective is to protect the natural \ntheir  watersheds \nresources  of \n(biodiversity,  water,  forests)  from  continued  threats,  and  promote  their \nsustainable use through the integrated conservation and development of \nselected  wetlands  and  forest  areas  of  the  Plain  and  improve  the  well- \nbeing  of  local  communities.  The  project  scope  includes  watershed \nmanagement,  wetland  nature \nreserve  management,  alternative \nlivelihood, and education and capacity building. The project management \ncomponent  will  carry  out  overall  implementation,  administration,  and \nmonitoring.  The  world  will  benefit  from  the  enhanced  conservation  of \nglobally  significant  biodiversity  through  the  Project.  The  project  area \ncovers  18  counties  situated  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain,  in  the  northeast  of \nHeilongjiang Province. \n \nThe Project will cost about $55.55 million equivalent, $9.41 million of this \nin foreign exchange and $46.14 million equivalent in local currency.  \n \n\n \nSource of Financing  \nAsian Development Bank  \nGlobal Environment Facility  \nHeilongjiang Provincial \n\nGovernment \n\nCounty Governments    \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n1.56 \n5.67 \n2.18 \n \n0.00 \n9.41 \n\n($ million equivalent) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n13.44 \n6.47 \n22.19 \n \n4.04 \n46.14 \n\nTotal \nCost \n15.00 \n12.14 \n24.37 \n \n4.04 \n55.55 \n\n \nPercent \n27 \n22 \n44 \n \n7 \n100 \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \nA  loan  to  the  PRC  in  the  amount  of  $15.00  million  from  the  ordinary \ncapital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility.

To \nprovide  implementation  support  to  the  PMO,  international  consulting \nfirms  in  association  with  domestic  firms  will  be  selected  using  ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and-cost-based  selection  method.  The  total  consultant  input  for \nthe Project is estimated at 640 person-months (112 international and 528 \ndomestic)  of  technical  assistance.  Consultants  are  required  in  the \nmanagement  of  water  resources,  wetland  biodiversity,  and  NRs;  eco-\ntourism;  and  conservation  education  and  awareness  subcomponents. \nThe  Project  will  also  recruit  qualified  academic/research  institutes  for \nseveral  studies,  surveys,  and  long-term  training  programs,  including \nthose in water resources. \n \nThe potential global environmental benefits will be (i) increases in areas \nof breeding and foraging habitats for waterfowl and other wildlife, and the \nresultant  increases  in  populations  of  globally  threatened  species; \n(ii) improved  water  resources  management  locally  and  in  watersheds \nleading  to  improved  wetlands  habitat  quality  and  increasing  wildlife \nnumbers; and (iii) reduced threats to globally threatened wildlife through \nincreased public and private awareness of the importance of wetlands for \nenvironmental  conservation.  The  Project  will  result  in  positive  global, \nnational,  and  local  environmental  impacts.  It  is  estimated  that  about \n46,000  forestry  workers  will  have  working  opportunities  during  the \nimplementation  period.

The overall financial internal rate \nof  return  of  these  forest  developments  is  14.9%,  greater  than  the \nestimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  6.1%.  The  high  financial \nreturn is due to low capital costs required in treating existing forests. The \noverall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  on  national  environmental \nbenefits is 24.8% outweighing the social cost of capital of 12%. \n  \nThe  removal  of  threats  to  wetland  biodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain \nrequires  the  following:  (i) cooperation  among  resource  authorities  in \nintegrating  watershed  management  with  development  and  conservation \nplanning, \nthrough  better-trained \npersonnel, (iii) mutually beneficial relationships between protected areas \nand  surrounding  communities,  and  (iv) sustainable  financial  support  to \nNR  management.

After the Project was included in the GEF Council\u2019s Work Program in July 2004, an \nADB  Appraisal  Mission  visited  the  PRC  to  refine  the  Project  design  and  discuss  with  the \nGovernment the project objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, financing plan, \nand  components.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  Mission  in  the  field  and  wide-\nranging consultations with stakeholders. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n1\n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\nAgricultural and food security policies in the PRC in the second half of the 20th century \n3. \nincluded  a  massive  effort  to  expand  grain  production  into  the  last  areas  of  uncultivated  fertile \nsoils. The Sanjiang Plain,\n a vast complex of marshes, meadows, and forests along the Russian \nborder  in  the  northeast  of  Heilongjiang  Province,  was  a  major  area  of  focus.  Extensive \n to  a  fifth  of  their \ndevelopment  over  five  decades  has  shrunk  the  forestlands  and  wetlands\noriginal  size  and  thus  brought  about  various  climatic  changes  (dry  weather,  drought,  and \nfrequent floods). \n\n3\n\n2\n\n4. \nDeforestation and cultivation of hillsides in the Sanjiang Plain have caused deterioration \nof  the  wetlands  due  to  soil  erosion  and  diminished  the  water-retention  capacity  of  uplands. \nForest workers lost income from timber production and often fell into poverty.\n A potentially self-\nsustaining  sector  is  not  realizing  their  growth  and  quality  potential.  Consequently,  potential \nbenefits  of  the  upland  forests  to  the  hydrological  cycle  in  the  watersheds  are  undermined.  As \nthe  Plain  has  become  more  densely  settled  and  reclaimed  as  farmland,  the  water-holding \ncapacity  of  the  wetlands  has  diminished  even  as  flooding  has  become  more  frequent  and \nintense.  To  reduce  economic  damage  to  farmland  and  protect  the  people  from  destructive \nflooding, the Government has built flood control dikes. Wetland drainage and dike construction \non river floodplains have helped increase the cultivated land base, but have also damaged the \nnatural  flood-retention  capacity  of  wetlands  that  support  globally  significant  fauna  and  flora, \n\n4\n\n                                                 \n1\n   ADB.  2002.

The project concept entered the GEF financing pipeline in December 1999. \n\n  Sanjiang  means  \u201cthree  rivers\u201d\u2014the  Heilong,  Wusuli,  and  Songhua  rivers.  The  Songhua  River  runs  through  the \nSanjiang  Plain,  and  the  Heilong  and  Wusuli  rivers  run  along  the  border  between  the  PRC  and  Russia.  The \nSanjiang Plain (with about 8 million people living on 108,900 square kilometers (km2) of land, or slightly bigger than \nthe  Republic  of  Korea)  accounts  for  20%  of  Heilongjiang  Province  (both  in  area  and  population)  and  lies  at  the \nconfluence of the three rivers. Before the agricultural development programs started in the 1950s, almost 50% of \nthe Plain used to be wetlands. \n\n  \u201cWetland\u201d is a general term for marshes, swamps, wet meadows, shallow lakes, and streamside areas. Boundaries \nof  wetlands  are  transitional  and  are  shaped  by  precipitation,  evaporation,  watershed  hydrology,  and  wetland \nvegetation. \n\n  Heilongjiang has a poverty incidence of 9.7%\u201310.3% in the countryside, using official rural poverty indices at the \nnational level, and a per capita net annual income for poor households of CNY1,000. About 10% of households in \nState forest farms are poor. \n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndehydrating  those  wetlands  and  threatening  their  biodiversity.  As  the  population  grows, \ndevelopment  accelerates,  and  the  floodplains  are  more  densely  settled,  the  economic  cost  of \nflood  damage  will  also  increase.  The  Government  has  therefore  integrated  nonstructural \nmeasures  such  as  flood  forecasting  and  development  of  decision  support  systems  to  better \nmanage  flood  emergencies.\n But  these  measures  cannot  fully  reflect  holistic  watershed \nmanagement  approach  as  part  of  an \nfloodplains  and  wetland  ecosystem \nmanagement.  A  new  policy\n emphasizes  the  need  to  move  toward  natural  resource \nmanagement  as  a  long-term,  holistic  way  of  floodplain  management,  which  includes  restoring \nfarmland to wetlands and forest. The sector is challenged to increase the forest cover, to sustain \nagricultural production, as well as to ensure the livelihood of farm and forest workers. \n\nintegrated \n\n6\n\n5\n\nThe  Sanjiang  Plain,  as  one  of  the  PRC\u2019s  richest  in  globally  significant  flora  and  fauna, \n5. \n7\nsupports  about  37  ecosystems,  1,000  species  of  plants,  and  528  species  of  vertebrate  fauna\n \nincluding 23 of the globally threatened species on the World Conservation Union Red List. Ten \nof the globally threatened species are waterfowl such as cranes, storks, and swan geese, which \nrequire  extensive,  undisturbed  wetlands  during  their  migration  and  breeding  seasons.  The \nSanjiang Plain wetlands are an important nesting and stopover location at the northern end of \nthe East Asian\u2013Australian flyway for migratory waterfowl, most notably the white-naped and red-\ncrowned  cranes.  The  wetlands  are also  ranked  as  globally  important  in  the  Directory  of  Asian \nWetlands. The transformation of the Sanjiang Plain into a major grain production field over the \nlast  five  decades  has  therefore  been  achieved  at  considerable  loss  of  plant  and  animal \nbiodiversity,  and  overall  cost  to  the  environment.  As  the  altered  water  cycle  in  the  wetlands \nreduced  their  habitat  size  and  self-cleaning  capacity,  plant  and  animal  biodiversity  of  global \nsignificance has declined. The northeast tiger, red deer, bear, and other large wildlife have been \nkilled  off,  and  formerly  abundant  ducks,  geese,  cranes,  and  other  waterfowl  have  nearly \ndisappeared. Less than one tenth of the original populations of cranes now nest in the Sanjiang \nPlain. For these wetland-dependent wildlife species to survive, the continuing trend toward the \nreduction and degradation of the Sanjiang Plain wetlands must be reversed. \n\n8\nThe Government has adopted several important national policies and legal measures\n\n6. \n to \nguide  and  direct  habitat  restoration  and  biodiversity  conservation.  The  Wild  Animal  Protection \nLaw  of  1988  has  reduced  the  overexploitation  of  wildlife  from  hunting  and  egg  collecting.  In \n1993  the  PRC  ratified  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity,  which  resulted  from  the  Rio  de \nJaneiro Conference on United Nations Environment and Development, and in 1994 it issued the \nBiodiversity Conservation Action Plan. The Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG) issued in \n\n                                                 \n5\n  From 1999 to 2002, the Government invested CNY178.6 billion ($22.3 billion) in building infrastructure for hydraulic \nprojects,  almost  2.5  times  more  than  in  the  previous  five  decades.  About  10%  of  such  investments  went  to \nnonstructural measures; particularly flood detention basins and forecasting and modeling systems. The Australian \nAssistance  for  International  Development  is  funding  the  Yangtze  River  Flood  Control  and  Management  Project \n($12 million), which will improve flood forecasting, flood warning, and the operation of 24 flood detention basins (up \nto 300 km2 in the area) along the middle reaches of the Yangtze. The Canadian International Development Agency \nhas  recently  completed  a  major  hydraulic  modeling  study  to  improve  flood  forecasting  for  Donting  Lake,  in  the \nmiddle reaches of the Yangtze River. ADB\u2019s Songhua and Yellow River flood management projects also adopted \nnonstructural measures\u2014flood forecasting and modeling. \n\n6\n  The policy initiatives, by former Premier Zhu, are written in 32 words in Chinese, but no other formal documentation \nis  available.  The  policy  calls  for  the  following:  enclosing  mountains  to  plant  trees,  transforming  arable  land  back \ninto forests, demolishing polder fields to release floods, transforming farmland back into lakes, supplying labor as \ncontribution,  relocating  people  to  build  townships,  reinforcing  stem  river  levees,  and  dredging  river  channels  and \nlakes. Under the initiatives, the PRC is renewing flood control plans for all major river basins.  \n\n7\n  A  detailed  review  and  analysis  is  included  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A:  Profile  of  Wetlands  Biodiversity  in  the \n\n8\n  A detailed review and analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B: Institutional, Legal, and Policy Analysis. \n\nSanjiang Plain. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n9\n\n1996  the  Regulation  of  Nature  Reserves,  establishing  priority  wetland  NRs,\n and  in  1998  the \nDecision on Wetland Conservation (Document of Heilongjiang Party Committee, No. 21, 1998), \nsuspending  further  conversion  of  wetlands  to  farmland.  In  2002,  the  National  Wetland \nConservation  Action  Plan,  outlining  priority  actions  to  guide  conservation,  use,  management, \nand  institutional  frameworks,  was  approved.  The  plan  was  reinforced  a  year  later  with  the \nissuance of one of the PRC\u2019s first wetland regulations (Regulations on Wetland Conservation of \nHeilongjiang  Province,  HPG,  2003).  The  new  regulations  recognize  the  multiple  values  of \nwetlands,  the  necessity  of  conserving  and  managing  them  through  the  establishment  of  NRs, \nand the reality that wetlands and their wildlife remain threatened by agricultural expansion and \nexploitation of water and land resources. Despite the impressive legal steps, however, wetland \nrestoration and protection are still new concepts in the PRC. Wetland restoration programs have \nbeen  planned,  but  sound  wetland  management  expertise  and  scientific  knowledge,  not  to \nmention familiarity with healthy water resource management, are scarce. \n\n10\n\n7. \nThe  protected  wetland  area  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  now  includes  28  NRs,  which  cover \n10,278 square kilometers (km2), or 9.4% of the Plain. Three of the NRs have been listed by the \nRamsar  Convention  Bureau\n as  wetlands  of  international  importance.  The  NRs  were \nestablished to protect the best remaining wetland habitats and their biodiversity, including most \nof the known sites for waterfowl nesting and migration. Nevertheless, wetland biodiversity is still \nthreatened  by  local  communities  exploiting  biological  resources  for  income,  inappropriate \nfarming practices in NRs, commercial tourism, and the limited management capacity of NR staff. \nWetland  protection  policies  and  laws  should  be  further  strengthened  and  supplemented  with \noperational  tools  and  enforcement  measures.  Moreover,  the  low  community  awareness  of \nwetland  values  still  presents  a  serious  challenge,  preventing  the  NRs  from  attaining  their \nobjectives of habitat conservation and environmental protection through laws. \n\n8. \nDifferent  economic  activities  and  wetland-dependent  wildlife  species  vie  for  land  and \nwater  resources  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain.  Economic  decisions  on  wetland  use  are  fragmented \namong  various  sectoral  agencies  of  the  HPG,  such  as  the  Agriculture  Department,  Water \nResources Department, Forest Department, Environmental Protection Bureau, State farms, and \nState forest farms. The 2003 Heilongjiang Wetland Regulations, however, gave official authority \nand  responsibility  for  wetland  management  to  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Forest  Department \n(HPFD).  An  integrated  water  resource  plan  for  wetland  management  and  biodiversity \nconservation,  with  NRs  playing  a  key  role,  is  needed.  The  various  institutions  must  also \ncoordinate  among  themselves  in  water  and  land  resource  sharing,  as  well  as  in  information \ngathering  and  planning.  Such  coordination  mechanisms  have  yet  to  be  established,  and  roles \nand responsibilities still have to be defined clearly. With funding from the National Development \nand Reform Committee (NDRC), HPFD is about to launch a project that will restore 1,500 km2 of \nfarmland to wetlands and replant 685 km2 yearly from 2006 to 2010. HPG realizes that it must \nimprove its wetlands management approach, knowledge, and capacity to tackle this challenging \ntask.  It  has  therefore  sought  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  developing  a  model  approach  that  could  be \n\n                                                 \n9\n\n10\n\n   Nature  reserves  (NRs)  are  specially  designated  areas  protected  by  PRC  laws  (National  Regulation  of  Nature \nReserves,  effective  1  December  1994)  to  conserve  wetland  habitats.  Current  regulations  based  on  these  laws \ndirect  NR  establishment  and  operation  at  all  levels.  Article  43  of  the  National  Regulation,  however,  requires \nadministrative levels below the State to use these regulations as a blueprint in developing and implementing their \nown regulations. \n The  Convention  on  Wetlands,  signed  in  Ramsar,  Iran,  in  1971,  is  an  intergovernmental  treaty  that  provides  the \nframework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their \nresources. There are now 138 Contracting Parties to the Convention and 1,367  wetland sites, totaling 1.2 million \nkm2,  designated  for  inclusion  in  the  Ramsar  List  of  Wetlands  of  International  Importance.  The  PRC  ratified  the \nRamsar  Convention  on  31  July  1992.  The  Ramsar  sites  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain\u2014Honghe  NR,  Sanjiang  NR,  and \nXingkaihu  NR,  which  is  one  of  the  project  sites\u2014  (i)  support  23  globally  threatened  species  and  16  endemic \nspecies, and (ii) represent 16% of the total area of the Ramsar sites in the PRC.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nB. \n\n \n\nreplicated effectively on a wider scale and in strengthening HPG\u2019s capability to manage wetland \nbiodiversity.   \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nThreats and Constraints \n\n9. \nGlobally  significant  endangered  species  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  rely  on  wetland  habitats, \nand  wetlands  must  have  enough  water  to  maintain  their  saturated  soils  (including  peat), \ndistinctive  vegetation,  and  productivity.  Agricultural  development  has  dramatically  altered  the \nhydrology  of  the  watersheds  in  the  Plain,  desiccating  many  of  the  remaining  wetlands,  even \nwithin NRs. Also, the construction of flood control dikes to protect farmlands, the deforestation in \nthe middle and upper watersheds, and poor conservation practices on sloping agricultural lands \nhave all tended to reduce water retention in entire watersheds in the Plain; accelerating runoff, \nincreasing evaporation, or through soil erosion and sedimentation. These changes in watershed \nnot  only  worsen  flooding  but  also  prolong  droughts  at  critical  times  of  the  year.  As  farming \nexpands  and  HPG  faces  a  future  of  water  scarcity,  it  becomes  more  difficult  to  maintain  or \nincrease  the  forest  and  wetland  areas,  and  to  provide  the  wetlands  with  the  needed  water \nsupplies.  The  proposed  Project  aims  to  remove  the  barriers  to  balanced  environmental \nprotection,  and  to  develop  sustainable  and  replicable  models  to  be  applied  elsewhere  in  the \nSanjiang  Plain  and  other  provinces.  The  key  barriers  (Appendix  2)  that  restrict  wetlands \nprotection and biodiversity conservation in the Sanjiang Plain are as follows. \n\n10. \nUnsound  Local  Planning  Water  Resource  Allocation.  Agricultural,  industrial,  and \ndomestic  water  uses  draw  on  water  supplies  that  are  also  needed  to  sustain  wetlands. \nAgriculture accounts for 70% of water use in Heilongjiang Province. Frequent droughts indicate \nserious  problems  of  groundwater  overdraft  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain.  According  to  the  Five-Year \nComprehensive Water Plans for the Province, the \u201cecological water supply\u201d is a marginal 3.6% \nof  the  total  requirements.  This  is  a  gross  underestimate  that  does  not  adequately  cover  the \nwater  requirements  of  the  Sanjiang  Plain  wetlands.  Water  consumption  for  agriculture  in  the \nProvince is expected to increase as the irrigated area expands from 9,530 km2 to 14,130 km2 by \n2010.  Any  further  expansion  of  irrigation  diversions  or  groundwater  overpumping  would  also \nreduce  the  available  water  for  wetlands,  besides  lowering  the  groundwater  table.  Although \nHeilongjiang Province has formally halted further wetland drainage, agricultural interests in the \n The  great  need  for \nSanjiang  Plain  are  still  active  in  wetland  drainage  projects  near  NRs\narable  land  is  unavoidable  as  the  population  grows.  To  protect  wetland  NRs,  water  resource \nallocation at the local level must be optimized.  \n\n11\n\n.\n\n \n\nPoor  Understanding  of  Nonstructural  Flood  Mitigation  and  Floodplain \n11. \nManagement.  Flood  control  and  management  have  become  a  high-priority  issue  for  HPG, \nespecially  after  the  devastating  floods  of  1998.  Flood  control  measures  are  still  mainly \nstructural\u2014dikes,  pumping  schemes,  and  flood  storage  reservoirs,  which  often  encroach  on \nwetlands  or  obstruct  water  supply  to  wetland  NRs.  Wetland  conservation  has  not  been  a \nsignificant  consideration  in  flood  control  in  the  comprehensive  water  resource  plans  prepared \nevery 5 years. However, flood control agencies of the Government now realize that allowing the \nnatural flow of floodwater can be beneficial for wetlands conservation. An assessment must be \nmade  to  (i)  strike  a  suitable  balance  between  flood  protection  and  wetland  conservation;  (ii) \nanalyze changes in precipitation in the catchment basin and the future seasonal runoff behavior \nof  the  main  watercourses  as  part  of  forecasting;  (iii)  determine  the  factors  for  the  efficient \nimplementation  of  integrated  floodplain  management  in  watersheds;  and  (iv) develop  the  most \nappropriate management model, which can be adapted to suit different watershed conditions. \n\n                                                 \n11\n\n  NRs are legally protected by land use zoning. Thus, threats to NRs from expanding agricultural land are not due to \nthe land use conversion but due to a lowering groundwater table, which further affects the size of wetlands in \nNRs.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nLack  of  Alternative  Livelihood  Enterprises,  Leading  to  Exploitation  of  Nature \n12. \nReserve  Resources.  The  prospect  of  a  net  annual  income  of  $210  to  $256  per  hectare  from \ndryland grain production (wheat-soy-corn) strongly motivates farmers to expand the farmland in \nany way possible, including draining wetlands. Pesticide and fertilizer pollution, burning, grazing, \nand  other  agricultural  practices  within  or  near  NRs  adversely  affect  ecology.  Rural  residents \nexploit  fish,  wildlife  (e.g.,  duck  eggs),  and  other  \u201ccommon  property\u201d  wetland  resources  to \nsupplement  their  diet  and  income.  Alternative  livelihood  enterprises  must  be  provided  to \ndiscourage such harmful natural resource exploitation in wetlands. \n\n13.  Weak  Interagency  Coordination  for  Integrated  Watershed  Management.  Irrigation \nand drainage, flood control, agricultural development, and wetland protection responsibilities in \nthe  Sanjiang  Plain  are  divided  among  agencies  with  little  basis  or  incentive  for  coordination. \nAlthough  HPFD  now  has  formal  authority  for  wetland  protection,  State  farms  and  other \nprovincial  agencies  that  work  in  drainage  and  irrigation  projects  allocate  water  resources  and \nmake  watershed  forest  management  decisions  independently  of  one  another.  Interagency \ncoordination is urgently needed for integrated watershed management.  \n\n14.  Weak  Technical  Capacity  in  NR  Management.  Personnel  responsible  for  managing \nwetland  NRs  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  rarely  have  the  necessary  training  for  duties  such  as \nenforcement,  wildlife  surveys,  natural  resource  monitoring,  and  public  outreach.  Many  staff \nmembers  were  recently  reassigned  to  NRs  from  agricultural  positions  in  State  farms,  reed \nproduction  companies,  or  similar  productive  enterprises.  Moreover,  NR  management  is  a  new \nresponsibility  of  HPFD,  which  has  no  training  program  for  its  wetland  NR  staff  members,  who \nare seriously underprepared for their duties. Thus, a training program for wetland NR staff and \nmanagers is urgently needed.  \n\n15. \nLack  of  a  Replicable  Financing  Model  and  Shortage  of  Available  Capital  to \nReplace  Arable  Farmland.  Wetland  restoration  will  require  converting  farmland  back  to \nwetlands within certain NRs. Farmers on State farms and villagers with agricultural leases within \nthe  NRs  must  be  compensated  for  the  income  lost  and  provided  with  replacement  land  as \nrequired. On the other hand, the financial burden on the Government for replacing lost farmland \nshould be manageable. To address the financial constraints, an alternative model approach that \nprovides  opportunities  for  revenue  generation  (sustainable  livelihood)  and  positive  returns  on \ninvestment, instead of sunk compensation costs, is needed.  \n\n16. \nLow  Public  Awareness  of  Wetland  Values  and  Biodiversity  Conservation. \nBiodiversity  conservation  and  wetland  protection  are  hampered  by  the  lack  of  education  and \ntraining  and  low  awareness  of  the  environmental  values  of  wetlands  among  the  people  in \nvillages  surrounding  the  NRs.  Simply  restoring  farmland  to  wetlands  would  result  in  only \ntemporary protection, which would be unsustainable over the longer term. Thus, an appropriate \ncommunity awareness campaign is required.  \n\nIncorrect  Interpretation  of  Legislation  on  Experimental  Zones.  NR  establishment \n17. \nand management are governed primarily by regulations adopted by the State Council in 1994. \nAs  defined  by  the  Environment  and  Natural  Resource  Protection  Legal  Handbook  (1998), \nprotected wetland NRs comprise three types of zones: core, buffer, and experimental. Human \nactivities in core and buffer zones are clearly prohibited, but activities in the experimental zone \n(the outer portion of the NR surrounding the buffer zone) are permitted subject to interpretation \nof local regulations. Past activities in the experimental zone have disturbed wildlife nesting and \nbreeding,  and  further  unauthorized  use  could  threaten  wetland  biodiversity  conservation \nbecause  of  habitat  loss  and  degradation.  A  clearer  interpretation  of  NR  legislation  and  more \neffective enforcement are required.   \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n18. \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  development  program  was  set  out  by  the  16th  Party  Congress  in \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n2002, the 10th National People\u2019s Congress of 2003, and the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2000\u20132005). \nThe  major  focus  of  national  economic  policy  has  gradually  shifted  in  the  last  few  years  from \nhard economic indicator targets toward quality of growth and sustainable development. Besides \nits continued strong emphasis on market-related reforms and nonstate sector development, the \nGovernment  is  increasingly  emphasizing  the  protection  of  the  environment,  sustained  natural \nresource management, and a better quality of life. National economic priorities include programs \nto  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas,  increase  rural  incomes,  improve  income  distribution,  and \nenable the private sector to create employment. Farmers may now leave their farming business \nby  selling  land-use  rights  or  take  advantage  of  government  land  conversion  programs.  One \nsuch  program  is  the  Farm-to-Forest  Program  of  NDRC,  which  has  converted  vast  areas  of \nmarginal  farmland  to  forestland  in  upper  watersheds  of  northern  PRC.  The  conversion  of \nfarmland to wetlands in Heilongjiang, begun in 2003, is in line with this program. \n\n19. \nAgricultural  Policy  and  Wetlands.  The  PRC\u2019s  Agenda  21  White  Paper  on  China\u2019s \nPopulation, Environment and Development in the 21st Century requires, among others, holistic \ntreatment  of  watersheds  as  fundamental  to  wetland  management.  The  agriculture  sector  has \nincreasingly emphasized environmental protection and sustainable farming since the Agenda 21 \nAgriculture Action Plan of 1998. This document mentions the need for biodiversity conservation \nand  wise  use  of  farmland,  grassland,  and  ecosystems,  as  well  as  monitoring  and  control  of \nagricultural  pollution.  It  sets  the  goal  of  \u201cestablishing  160  conservation  zones  to  cover  a  total \narea  of  25  million  hectares\u201d  (ha)  to  strengthen  the  conservation  of  wildlife,  and  will  conduct \nmonitoring and research in agricultural/pasture/fishery areas.\n\n  \n\n12\n\n20. \nForest  Policy  and  Watersheds.  The  Natural  Forest  Protection  Program  (NFPP)  for \n1998\u20132010  drastically  restricts  the  harvesting  of  natural  forests  nationwide,  allowing  HPG  to \nstrengthen its commercial forests. The Sanjiang Plain has about 1.1 million ha of forests: over \n0.7  million  ha  of  natural  forests  and  almost  0.4  million  ha  of  commercial  forest  plantations. \nHeilongjiang Province has the country\u2019s largest standing timber reserves and timber production. \nHence,  current  national  and  provincial  policy  is  to  replant  forests  on  a  commercial  basis  on \nexcessively  steep,  erodible,  or  unproductive  farmland,  and  compensate  the  farmers  under  the \nFarm-to-Forest Program. The availability of compensation funds limits State forest farms\u2019 ability \nto  carry  out  this  program  only  within  their  own  forestlands,  substantial  portions  of  which  are \ncurrently leased to forest workers for grain production as alternative income sources. \n\n21. \nBiodiversity  Conservation.  PRC\u2019s  Biodiversity  Conservation  Action  Plan  (BCAP), \nissued on 13 June 1994, lists and describes priority biodiversity conservation projects. Project \n18\u2014Establishment of an Integrated Nature Reserve Network in the Sanjiang Plain, Heilongjiang \nProvince\u2014 has been achieved in part by the establishment of 28 national, provincial, and local \nNRs.  The  PRC  is  also  a  signatory  to  the  Convention  on  Wetlands  (Ramsar  Convention). \nComplementing  the  BCAP  is  the  National  Wetland  Conservation  Action  Plan  (NWCAP), \napproved in 2002, which is the key document guiding the conservation, use, and management \nof PRC wetlands. The NWCAP lists among \u201cimportant wetlands in China\u201d several that are part \nof the project area: the Sanjiang Plain in general, the Naoli-Qixing river basin, the lower reaches \nof  the  Muling  River,  Xingkai;  and  the  Small  Xingkai  lakes.  The  NWCAP  calls  for  an  inventory \nand study of the wetlands, as well as \u201ccomprehensive management of wetland and hydrologic \nbasins\u201d  and,  particularly  in  Project  20,  \u201cwetland  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  the \nSanjiang Plain.\u201d  \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP  2004\u20132007)  for  the  PRC  places  strong \n22. \nemphasis on (i) promoting equitable and inclusive growth,  especially in remote rural areas; (ii) \n\n                                                 \n12\n\n Agriculture Action Plan for China\u2019s Agenda 21, Section 7.53, 1998. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nmaking the markets work better; (iii) improving the environment, including dealing with land and \nwater degradation issues; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. CSP 2004\u20132007 thoroughly \nreflects the PRC\u2019s medium- and long-term strategy and is focused on the following sectors: (i) \nagricultural and rural development, including land degradation; (ii) transport and energy; and (iii) \nthe  environment,  including  water  and  soil  management.  Conservation  of  soils,  forests,  and \nwetlands  and  abatement  of  water  pollution  are  recognized  as  critical  environmental \ninterventions  with  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor.  In  this  context,  the  proposed  Project  strongly \nsupports ADB\u2019s principal strategic concerns. The wetlands and forests of the Sanjiang Plain are \nforested \nmajor  environmental  assets.  Appropriate  conservation  of  wetlands  and \nwatersheds  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  flood  management  and  overall  watershed \nmanagement  in  the  river  basins,  while  encouraging  agricultural  interests  to  use  water  more \nwisely.  Project  income-generating  initiatives  are  aimed  at  remote  forest  farms  and  wetland \nareas, supporting ADB\u2019s focus on equitable and inclusive growth. \n\ntheir \n\n \n\n4. \n\nThe Global Environment Facility  \n\n23. \nThe Project addresses both the underlying and proximate causes of wetland habitat loss \nby  creating  a  model  framework  to  protect  high-quality  wetlands,  and  by  building  community \nrelations and NR management capacity to maintain the health of these wetlands. HPG actions \nand  project initiatives  strongly  complement  each  other.  HPG  took  concrete  regulatory  steps  in \n2003  to  clarify  responsibility  for  wetland  management  and  to  emphasize  its  commitment  to \nimproving the management of wetland NRs in the Sanjiang Plain. HPG will implement activities \nspecifically  identified in the  BCAP  and  NWCAP  of  the  PRC.  The  Project  addresses  a national \npriority and therefore meets a GEF criterion. GEF supports only strategic operational program \n(OP) areas with global benefits. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector and Lessons Learned \n\n24.  Wetlands  protection  and  biodiversity  conservation  are  relatively  new  concepts  in  the \nPRC, as well as in HPG, and there has been very little external assistance directly for NRs and \nSanjiang  Plain  wetlands  protection  (Appendix  3).  (One  exception,  a  project  of  the  United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP)/GEF had Honghe and Sanjiang NRs in the Sanjiang \nPlain as two of four pilot study cases.) ADB and World Bank assistance in the natural resources \nand  environment  sectors  has  focused  on  improving  flood  management  and  increasing \nagricultural  production.  ADB\u2019s  forest  development  projects  in  general  provide  lessons  from \nvarious  countries,  indicating  (i)  community  participation  and  (ii)  partnership  between  forest \ndepartment  and  participants,  as  key  factors  in  the  success  of  plantations  and  reforestation. \nMore recently, ADB assistance to the PRC in the environment sector has focused on developing \nthe  institutional  framework  for  combatting  land  degradation  in  the  western  region.  The  $12 \nmillion  UNDP/GEF  project  Wetland  Biodiversity  Conservation  and  Sustainable  Use  in  China, \n2001\u20132006,  may  complement  the  proposed  Project.  However,  this  project  has  taken  an \nengineering  approach  to  restoring  the  hydrologic  regime  at  specific  NRs,  and  its  institutional \narrangements for NR management from the nation\u2019s capital have been complicated and difficult \nto  implement  at  the  local  level.  The  proposed  Project  addresses  these  two  weaknesses  by  (i) \ntreating wetland protection and water resource management holistically at the watershed scale, \nnot  simply  at  the  level  of  NR  sites;  and  (ii)  implementing  and  administering  the  Project  at  the \nprovincial  level  to  improve  coordination  and  minimize  interagency  conflicts.  A  new  initiative  of \nthe  United  Nations  Environment  Programme \nthe  Amur  River  Basin \nTransboundary  Cooperation  Project,  focusing  on  land-based  pollution  along  the  Amur  and \nHeilong  rivers  on  the  boundary  between  the  PRC,  Mongolia,  and  Russia,  falls  under  the \ninternational water issue dealt with in OP 9, Integrated Land and Water Multiple Focal Area. The \nUNEP/GEF  initiative  requires  international  cooperation  for  biodiversity  conservation,  while  the \nproposed  Project  seeks  to  minimize  the  complexities  of  institutional  coordination  in  wetland \nmanagement  by  working  under  one  provincial  government  with  a  strong  sense  of  ownership. \n\n(UNEP)/GEF, \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  exchange  information  and  expertise  with  the  ongoing  UNDP/GEF  project\u2014 \nPeatlands, Biodiversity and Climate Change\u2014which is experimenting with wetland restoration in \nthe Ruoergai marshes, and with the UNEP/GEF Siberian crane project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives  \n\n25. \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Project  is  the  sustainable  management  of  natural  resources  to \nprotect  globally  significant  biodiversity  and  to  promote  economic  development.  The  immediate \nobjective is to protect the natural resources of the Sanjiang Plain wetlands and their watersheds \n(biodiversity, water, forests) from continued threats, and promote their sustainable use through \nthe  integrated  conservation  and  development  of  selected  wetlands  and  forest  areas  of  the \nSanjiang Plain and the improved  well-being of local communities. The Project will give priority \nattention  to  the  protection  of  globally  significant  wetlands  in  contiguous  watersheds,  by \nexpanding  the  upstream  forest  areas  while  protecting  downstream  wetlands  and  NRs.  The \nproject area covers 18 counties, situated in the Sanjiang Plain. These 18 counties are grouped \ninto five contiguous watersheds. Six NRs\n with the greatest concentration of biodiversity in the \nfive  watersheds  will  be  the  focus  of  protection/restoration  models.  Xingkaihu  NR  is  one  of  the \nsites listed by the Ramsar Convention, and the others are all national NRs. Thirteen out of 18 \ncounties  have  investment  proposals  of  reforestation  interventions  in  the  Sanjiang  watersheds \n(Map 2). \n\n13\n\n26. \nThe  proposed  project  intervention  is  based  on  the  need  to  integrate  sustainable \nenvironmental  management  strategies  with  rural  economic  development.  Rather  than  simply \naddress  the  sustainability  of  localized  environmental  issues  in  the  six  selected  pilot  NRs,  the \nProject aims at developing a model framework that can be replicated to provide direct examples \nfor ongoing HPG wetland and forestland restoration programs. The project approach conforms \nto  ADB\u2019s  CSP  (2004\u20132006);  is  fully  compatible  with  the  objectives  of  GEF\u2019s  biodiversity \nconservation focal area; and is consistent with the following strategic priorities indicated in GEF \nBusiness  Planning:  Directions  and  Targets:  Strategic  Priority  Biodiversity  (BD)-1:  Catalyzing \nSustainability  of  Protected  Areas,  BD-2:  Mainstreaming  Biodiversity  in  Production  Landscapes \nand Sectors, and BD-4: Generation and Dissemination of Best Practices for Addressing Current \nand  Emerging  Biodiversity  Issues.  Appendix  4  summarizes  the  rationale  for  GEF  involvement \nand  the  Project  contributions  to  national  sustainable  development  and  incremental  global \nbenefits.\n\n 14\n\n \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n27. \nThe four principal project components will address the main threats to globally significant \nbiodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain.  The  primary  global  benefit  will  be  the  increase  in  the \npopulation  of  globally  endangered  species  through  improved  wetland  habitat  and  wildlife \nmanagement at NRs. The country itself will benefit from strengthened forest development and \nsustainable environmental management. A fifth component, project management, covers project \nimplementation and management support.\n\n  \n\n15\n\nComponent  1:  Watershed  Management.  This  component  will  address  the  threat  to \n28. \nwetlands from competition for water resources and altered water balance in the Sanjiang Plain. \nThe subcomponents are (i) forest Improvement in watersheds, to improve forest management, \n\n                                                 \n13\n\n Supplementary  Appendix  C  discusses  the  site  selection  analysis  and  the  selected  six  NRs,  such  as  Anbanghe, \nDajihe, Naolihe, Qixinghe, Xingkaihu, and Zhenbaodao. \n GEF Executive Summary is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n  Supplementary  Appendix  E  includes  a  summary  table  of  the  Project\u2019s  physical  components  by  location,  and \ndescribes the project\u2019 components in greater detail.  \n\n14\n\n15\n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nreduce  surface  runoff,  and  increase  soil  water  retention  and  groundwater  recharging;  (ii)  local \nNR  water  resource  management,  to  restore  natural  water  balance  within  wetland  NRs;  and \n(iii) water  resource  planning  in  watersheds,  to  enhance  watershed-level  water  resource \nmanagement. Activities include planting 11,900 ha of indigenous poplar and larch on denuded \nslopes or farmland, and improving an additional 43,700 ha of existing plantations; establishing \ninteragency  working  groups  among  stakeholders  at  the  local  level  for  water  resource \nmanagement in targeted NRs; and developing model watershed-level water allocation plans in \nand around watersheds, incorporating flood control impact and wetland protection aspects, and \ninstitutionalizing this process.  \n\n29. \nComponent 2: Wetland Nature Reserve Management. This component is designed to \naddress  the  threats  from  past  wetland  conversion  and  degradation  of  habitat,  and  to  promote \nenhanced  biodiversity  protection  in  wetland  NRs.  The  subcomponents  are  (i)  conservation \nmanagement,  to  develop  monitoring  and  management  plans  and  methodologies;  (ii)  pilot \nwetland restoration, to provide models of well-designed and well-monitored wetland restoration \nin  the  six  project  NRs;  (iii)  wildlife  species  recovery,  to  promote  repopulation  of  NR  wetlands \nwith  globally  threatened  wildlife  species,  especially  high-profile  migratory  waterfowl  (cranes, \nstorks, and swan geese); and (iv) reduction of resource exploitation, by establishing of reliable \ninformation baselines and a geographic information system (GIS); management planning; pilot \nrestoration  of  3,433  ha  of  wetlands,  including  testing  various  restoration  techniques  (natural, \nsupported,  and  engineered  recovery)  as  appropriate  at  different  habitats/sites;  building  the \ncapacity  for  farmland-to-wetland  restoration;  developing  restoration  guidelines;  producing  a \nmanual on farmland-to-wetland restoration; and developing and implementing species recovery \nprograms.  The  model  wetland  restoration  approach  will  be  linked  to  alternative  livelihood \nschemes, to compensate for lost access to farmland and other resources. Seminars, workshops, \nand  conferences  will  be  held  to  share  the  learning  experiences,  to  extract  lessons,  and  to \nidentify core elements for successful replication and scaling up. \n\n16\n\nforest  product  (NTFPs) \n\n30. \nComponent  3:  Alternative  Livelihood  Programs.  In  this  component,  the  Project  will \ndevelop  and  implement  programs  for  sustainable  livelihood  in  villages  affected  by  reverting \nfarmland to legally designated forestlands or NR wetlands,\n to ensure lasting benefits for both \nthe  environment  and  the  affected  communities.  The  subcomponents  are  (i) agroforestry  and \nnontimber \nin  agroforestry \n(intercropping) and NTFPs to State forest farms affected by the reversion program, to increase \nincome-earning  opportunities  for  workers  whose  farming  activities  may  be  curtailed;  (ii)  village \ndevelopment,  providing  compensation  to  villages  affected  by  the  reversion  of  farmland  to  NR \nwetlands, including support for eco-friendly livelihood enterprises, or village development based \non  resettlement  and  village  development  plans;  and  (iii)  sustainable  ecotourism,  including \nmaster planning for NRs, preparation of tourism guidelines, and implementation of pilot projects \n(e.g., construction of basic NR infrastructure such as signboards).  \n\ninterventions,  providing \n\ninvestments \n\nComponent  4:  Education  and  Capacity  Building.  This  component  will  address  the \n31. \nroot  causes  of  overexploitation,  human  disturbances,  and  habitat  degradation  in  NRs  by \nincreasing the capacity of NR staff and building community knowledge about wetlands, wildlife, \nand nature conservation. Where possible and appropriate, there will be gender awareness and \nsensitivity  training  programs.  The  three  subcomponents  are  (i)  conservation  education,  for \nteachers  and  their  students  in  rural  schools  near  NRs;  (ii)  public  awareness,  to  improve \nunderstanding of the importance of conserving wetland resources among rural residents around \n\n                                                 \n16\n\n  Except for 43 households, there will be very little physical resettlement of people, but compensation will be given \nfor  loss  of  access  to  farmland  in  the  wetland  NRs.  Because  the  remaining  land  in  villages  will  be  reallocated, \nvillage  collectives  rather  than  individuals  will  be  affected.  Under  the  subcomponent  intercropping  and  nontimber \nforest products, the farmland to be reverted to forestlands in State forest farms already belongs to those farms and \nso there will be no need to transfer landownership.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nNRs;  and  (iii)  wetland  management  training,  primarily  to  give  NR  staff  practical  skills  and \nknowledge \ninvolve \nthe  wetland  NRs.  The  Project  will  actively \nacademic/scientific communities in building benefit monitoring and evaluation capacity. \n\nto  better  manage \n\n32. \nComponent  5:  Project  Management.  The  consulting  services  in  this  component  will \nstrengthen the coordination of technical support and improve the capacity of the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  to  manage  and  supervise  project  activities.  Project  implementation \ncapability at the provincial, county, and NR levels will be strengthened through technical support \nand  training  for  finance  and  technical  personnel.  Environmental  monitoring  will  also  be \nstrengthened through (i) mitigations, specifically for forestry improvement components, as part \nof  the  integrated  watershed  management  approach;  (ii)  further  environmental  assessment  for \nthe  pilot  wetland,  agroforestry,  and  NTFP  components  and  village  development \nsubcomponents;  and  (iii) monitoring  and  review  activities  of  the  Heilongjiang  provincial \nenvironmental bureaus, as part of mitigation implementation and environmental assessment.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  Project  will  develop  a  model  framework  for  dealing  with  root  causes,  and  adopt  a \n33. \nholistic  approach  for  wider  replication.  The  model  framework  will  incorporate  root  problems  of \ndifferent  scales  at  both  local  and  watershed  levels  by  integrating  the  management  of  upper \nwatershed  forested  areas  and  low-lying  wetland  habitats,  and  will  lay  the  foundation  for \nwidening  the  scale  to  the  river-basin  level  in  later  stages.  To  protect  globally  important \nbiodiversity  resources,  the  landscape  must  be  protected  so  that  globally  threatened  waterfowl \nand mammals have enough room for migration pathways, feeding grounds, and breeding sites. \nHowever, longer-term benefits depend, not only on the simple multiplication of activities but also \non  the  ability  to  scale  up  activities  to  cover  larger  areas.  For  these  reasons,  the  scaling  up  of \nproject interventions  is an  integral part  of  the exit  strategy,\n especially as  HPG  is expected  to \nrestore  150,000  ha  of  farmland  to  wetlands  by  2010  under  the  Master  Plan  for  Heilongjiang \nProvince Wetland Restoration. Thus, the Project will build an exit strategy to strengthen these \nkey  aspects  of  viability  and  sustainability,  and  formulate  target  indicators  for  monitoring  the \nsuccess of its scaling-up efforts.  \n\n17\n\n34. \nKey  elements  of  the  exit  strategy  are  (i)  strengthening  financial  sustainability  by  (a) \nimproving  forest  management  to  increase  the  financial  returns  of  the  sector;  (b)  covering \nrecurrent costs of NR management through successive yearly increases in payments by county \nforest  bureaus  of  CNY0,  2,  4,  6  and  8  ha/yr  during  implementation;  and  (c)  financing  village \ndevelopment  as  part  of  land  compensation  and  resettlement  costs  to  support  sustainable \nlivelihood; (ii) building community participation and awareness of the importance of biodiversity \nto  broaden support;  (iii)  strengthening  institutional  sustainability  through  scaled-up  interagency \ncoordination between local  and provincial water resource management agencies by (a) linking \nwater resource allocation planning by individual agencies and integrating this with development \nand  conservation  planning,  (b) sharing  information,  and  (c)  setting  up  working  groups  as \ncoordinating  committees;  and  (iv) institutionalizing  working  group  arrangements.  Resources \nhave been allocated for workshops and conferences to identify factors for successful scaling up, \nand for training relevant to the exit strategy.  \n\nThe Project\u2019s model approach will guide wetland restoration in more than 150,000 ha of \n35. \nNRs throughout the province. As 3,433 ha of farmland reverts to wetlands, village development \nplans (VDPs) will be attached to the restoration program to ensure that livelihood enterprises in \nvillages  affected  by  the  farmland-to-wetland  program  can  increase  alternative  income \nopportunities in a sustainable manner. Part of the land compensation will be targeted for village \n\n                                                 \n17\n\n The  exit  strategy  is  to  strengthen  these  key  aspects  of  sustainability  and  viability,  namely,  (i)  financing, \n(ii) institutional  framework, (iii) capacity  building, (iv) stakeholder participation, and (v) monitoring  and evaluation. \nFurther details are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ndevelopment. Individuals who give up farmland in the NRs will receive replacement land in their \nvillage, provided by the village collective. Land compensation will be paid to the village collective, \nwhich  will  reallocate  land  use.  Depending  on  the  village,  about  30%  of  resettlement \ncompensation will go to alternative livelihood enterprises, particularly those that are conducive \nto wetland management. Livelihood activities will be approved only after all the affected villagers \nare  consulted  and  consensus  is  reached  on  the  VDPs.  The  VDPs  will  form  part  of  the \nresettlement plans, and will be guided by the environmental management plan (EMP) to ensure \nthat  activities  near  the  NRs  are  consistent  with  wetlands/biodiversity  protection.  For  the \nfarmland-to-forest restoration program, investments will be made in agroforestry and NTFPs, to \nensure that villagers losing farmland retain at least the same standard of living. \n\n36. \nThe  elements  of  the  project  design  will  (i)  ensure  that  the  Project  benefits  the  people, \n(ii) provide a model framework that can be replicated extensively, and (iii) reduce the financial \nburden  of  resettlement  compensation  on  the  Government  from  sunk  cost  into  environmentally \nsustainable investment opportunities for the affected villages. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n37. \nThe  Project  will  cost  about  $55.55  million  equivalent,  with  $9.41  million  in  foreign \nexchange  and  $46.14  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.

The proposed financing plan \nis  justified  given  the  important  pilot  nature  of  the  environmental  protection  strategy  and  goals. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, an annual commitment charge of 0.75%, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. The front-end fee of 1.0% will be waived if the loan is \napproved by ADB before July 2005. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n18\n\nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  GEF  will  cofinance  the  Project \nthrough  a  grant  administered  by  ADB.\n The  GEF  grant  will  be  for  $12.14  million  equivalent \n(22% of the Project cost): $5.67 million in foreign exchange and $6.47 million equivalent in local \ncurrency.  The  Government  will  contribute  $24.37  million  equivalent  (44%  of  project  cost)  to \nfinance interest during construction and commitment charges of $2.18 million in foreign currency \nand $22.19 million equivalent in local currency. Local currency costs will also be financed partly \nby  GEF  and  ADB.  The  remaining  $4.04  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  will  be \nfinanced in kind by the participating beneficiaries and county governments as part of their equity \ncontribution for the income-generating activities.  \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \n1.56 \n 5.67 \n 2.18 \n 0.00 \n 9.41 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n13.44 \n 6.47 \n 22.19 \n 4.04 \n 46.14 \n\nTotal \nCost \n15.00 \n12.14 \n24.37 \n4.04 \n55.55 \n\n \nPercent \n27  \n22  \n44 \n 7 \n 100 \n\n \nSource  \nAsian Development Bank  \nGlobal Environment Facility  \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government \nCounty Governments \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nExecuting  Agency.  HPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  and  will  have \n\n39. \noverall responsibility for coordinating, supervising, and implementing all Project activities. \n\n40. \nProject  Steering  Committee. The Project Steering Committee (PSC), which has been \nestablished, will oversee Project implementation and set general policies related to the Project. \nThe Steering Committee will also be responsible for Project coordination between the PMO and \nall concerned HPG authorities. The Steering Committee will be composed of representatives of \nthe  relevant  HPG  agencies,  and  will  meet  once    every  six  months,  or  more  frequently  if \nnecessary. \n\nProject Management Office. A project management office (PMO) has been established \n41. \nwithin HPFD for the day-to-day implementation of the project, under the guidance of the PSC. \nComposed of professional and administrative staff assigned from government agencies for the \nProject,  the  PMO  will  have  the  capacity  to  carry  out  the  project  activities  in  coordination  with \nHPG agencies. It will be headed by  a full-time project director who will report to HPG through \nthe  PSC.  The  principal  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the  PMO  are  (i) managing  all  Project \nactivities  in  coordination  with  HPG  agencies  and  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  and \nguidelines  of  the  national  government,  HPG,  ADB,  and  GEF;  (ii)  planning  for,  and  monitoring \nand supervising of use of the project funds in coordination with HPFB, including from the State \nfarm bureaus, and (iii) administering, monitoring, reporting, and coordinating all Project activities. \nThe HPG Financial Bureau (HPFB) will be responsible for the administration and supervision of \ndisbursements of the proceeds or counterpart funds, from the loan, the GEF grant, the central \ngovernment, State farm bureaus and Heilongjiang country finance bureaus to the HPG agencies \nunder the Project. \n\n42. \nProject  Implementing  Agencies  and  Implementation  Units.  Besides  the  PMO,  19 \nproject implementation units (PIUs) with adequate professional and technical staffing will carry \nout  field  operations  and  coordinate  the  flow  of  funds  from  county  financial  bureaus  to  the \n\n                                                 \n18\n\n  Cofinancing is subject to the final approval of the Project by the GEF. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nbeneficiaries.  Thirteen  PIUs  will  be  housed  at  the  county  forestry  bureaus,  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  forest  management,  agroforestry,  and  NTFP \nactivities in the 13 project counties. The six other PIUs will be housed at six NRs where wetland \nNR  management  activities  will  be  implemented,  and  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  those \nactivities.  The  PIUs  will  be  staffed by  adequate  professional  and  technical  personnel  provided \nby either the county forestry bureaus or the NRs, depending on the type of PIU. The PIUs will \nprepare  their  annual  operating  plans  detailing  the  physical  and  financial  dimensions  of  their \nprogrammed  activities.  The  PMO  will  consolidate  the  PIU  annual  plans  into  a  project-level \nannual work plan and budget. \n\n43. \nCoordination. PSC will be composed of representatives of the relevant HPG agencies. \nPSC will be responsible for supervision of PMO and for coordination of agencies involved in the \nProject. The PMO will report directly to the PSC, which will be composed of representatives of \nprovincial government agencies, thus ensuring coordination between project management and \nall  concerned  provincial  authorities.  The  HPFD  has  responsibility  for  wetland  management  in \nthe province, as well as the forest management activities in state forest farms in the 13 project \ncounties.  This  will  give  the  PMO  staff  clear  lines  of  authority  for  project  activities  in  both  the \nupland and wetland project sites. Provincial-level coordination will also require close links with \nHPFB,  which  will  be  responsible  for  flow  of  funds  from  ADB  (including  GEF)  and  the  national \nand  provincial  governments.  The  PSC  will  oversee  project  implementation  and  set  general \nproject  policies  relevant  to  the  project.  A  field office  will  be  based in  the  Baoqing County  PIU, \nnear the center of the Sanjiang Plain, to support field activities. Technical working groups, to be \nformed  at  each  NR,  will  include  county-level  staff  of  the  Forestry  Department,  Environmental \nProtection  Bureau,  Water  Resource  Bureau,  and  Tourism  Bureau;  representatives  of  State \nforestry  farms,  State  farms,  or  villages  involved;  and  local  school  teachers.  Watershed-level \ninteragency  coordinating  body  will  be  established  at  the  provincial  level  to  coordinate  the \ncomponent,  water  resource  planning  in  watersheds.  The  project  implementation  organization \nchart is in Appendix 6. \n\nBeneficiary Participation. Since the lands for project components are still owned by the \n44. \nstate  farms,  village  collectives,  or  State  forest  farms,  engagement  and  joint  planning  and \ndevelopment  are  essential.  The  Project  will  support  the  involvement  of  local  communities  in \nproject  design,  implementation,  and  management  through  participation  in  preparing  the  (i)  NR \nmaster plans, (ii) watershed management plans, (iii) VDPs and alternative livelihood programs, \n(iv) ecotourism plans, and (v) employment opportunities related to project implementation (e.g., \ntree plantation and treatment). To promote participation and strengthen a sense of ownership, \nimproved  compensation  and  access  to  alternative  livelihood  development  will  be  provided  to \naffected communities.\n\n  \n\n19\n\n45. \nImplementation  Schedule.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  from  July  2005  to  June \n2010. Year 1 will involve management and implementation arrangements and other preparatory \ntasks. Year 5 will focus more on evaluation, monitoring, sustainability and exit strategy, and the \nhandover of responsibilities. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n\n46. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement. The Project involves the conversion to wetlands \nof  3,433  ha  of  farmland\u20141,433  ha  in  five  NRs  and  2,000  ha  in  Naoli  NR\u2014allocated  for \nconversion in 2002, and the provision of supplementary alternative livelihood support. Since 260 \nfarmers\n from  eight  villages  (in  six  NRs)  will  have  to  abandon  farming  in  the  NRs  and  future \nland  use  will  be  restricted,  the  farmers  will  have  to  be  compensated  for  lost  land  use  and \nnonmovable  assets.  A  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  for  Qixinghe  and \n\n20\n\n                                                 \n19\n\n20\n\n  Supplementary Appendix G discusses the social assessment and public participation plan. \n  Only 43 families will be physically relocated; the rest will require land compensation only. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n21\n\n22\n\nXingkaihu  NRs  have  been  prepared,\n endorsed  by  HPFD  and  approved  by  ADB.    In  the \nalternative  livelihood  component,  RPs  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the  six  NRs,  including \nupdates of the RPs for Qixinghe and Xingkaihu NRs. Each affected village (or State farm) will \nprepare  a  VDP  in  consultation  with  the  affected  farmers  and  county  officials.  The  PIUs  in  the \nNRs  will  review  the  VDPs\n to  ensure  that  the  types  and  locations  of  alternative  livelihood \nschemes and village improvements conform to the master plans for the NRs. Once each plan \nhas been screened for environmental impact, an agreement will be signed between the NR and \nthe  village  committee  or  State  farm.  RPs,  together  with  the  VDPs,  will  be  submitted  to  the \nprovincial PMO and to ADB for approval. After each plan is approved, land compensation and \nvillage  development  costs  can  be  disbursed  by  HPFB  (through  the  County  Financial  Bureau) \nfrom the counterpart fund to the affected village committee or State farm, and farmers will then \nabandon farming in the NRs. The counterpart funds will pay for the land compensation and all \nresettlement activities in the RPs, including the implementation of the approved VDPs. EA will \nset up an account for the resettlement costs (compensation and village development), which will \nbe  managed  by  HPFB.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  conducted  to \nensure compliance with ADB's resettlement policy. The summary resettlement framework is in \nAppendix 8. \n\n47. \nProcurement.  All  supplies,  equipment,  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. For cost efficiency, most items \nwill  be  procured  centrally  (by  the  PMO)  for  distribution  to  the  subproject  areas,  spread  widely \nover  the  13  project  counties.  The  Government\u2019s  domestic  procurement  procedures  will  be \nfollowed, provided they are acceptable to ADB. Equipment or materials for each contract valued \nat  $1,000,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Other  minor \nmiscellaneous equipment and supply packages, each valued below $100,000 equivalent, will be \nprocured through direct purchase. The force-account procedure will be applied to civil works for \nforest  improvement  and  wetland  restoration,  i.e.,  the  county  governments  (the  implementing \nagencies) will use their own work force and equipment, since each contract will have a value of \nless  than  $1  million  equivalent  and  the  locations  are  remote,  making  competitive  bidding \nunsuitable. Also, the implementing agencies can efficiently handle civil works at reasonable cost. \nIndicative procurement packages are listed in Appendix 9.  \n\n48. \nConsulting  Services.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nselecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Consulting  firms  will  be  selected  using  ADB\u2019s \nquality- and-cost-based selection method. The total consultant input for the Project is estimated \nat 640 person-months of consulting services: 112 international and 528 domestic. Consultants \nwill  be  required  for  water  resources,  wetland  biodiversity  and  nature  reserve  management; \necotourism;  conservation  education,  and  public  awareness  subcomponents.  The  Project  will \nalso  engage  the  services  of  qualified  academic/research  institutes  for  studies,  surveys,  and \nshort-  and  long-term  training  programs.  The  institutes  will  be  selected  by  HPG  according  to \ncompetitive selection criteria and procedures acceptable to ADB. The consultant requirements \nare summarized in Appendix 10. The training and education requirements for capacity building \nare summarized in Appendix 11. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Fund Flows. GEF funds will be channeled through \n49. \nADB,  and  ADB  will  disburse  both  ADB  loan  and  GEF  grant  funds  to  HPFB.  To  expedite  the \ndisbursement  of  the  loan  and  GEF  grant  proceeds,  HPG  will  set  up  imprest  accounts  in  a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n\n                                                 \n21\n\n  The full resettlement framework and the RPs for Xingkaihu NR in Mishan City and Qixinghe NR in Baoqing county \nhave been posted on ADB\u2019s web site (Supplementary Appendix H, I, and J, respectively).  \n  The percentage of compensation cost allocated for alternative livelihood schemes will depend on the VDP, but is \nestimated to average 30%. \n\n22\n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nof  January  2001  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial \ndeposit in the imprest account will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditure, or 10% of the \ntotal loan amount, whichever is less. HPG will disburse eligible expenditures under the Project \nthrough either (i) the imprest account, to be set up immediately after the loan agreement takes \neffect  and  managed  by  HPFB;  or  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  direct  payment,  commitment,  force  account,  or \nreimbursement procedures. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be followed \nin  liquidating  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursing  individual  SOE  payments  up  to  $100,000 \nequivalent. \n\nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  NRs  and  county  PIUs  will  keep  records  and \n50. \naccounts according to sound accounting principles and in sufficient detail to identify subprojects \nfinanced  by  the  loan  and  to  disclose  the  use  of  funds  under  the  Project.  The  records  and \naccounts will be forwarded regularly to the provincial PMO. HPFB will be responsible for overall \nproject  accounting  and  will  ensure  that  the  consolidated  provincial  project  accounts  are \nprepared for final consolidation and audited yearly by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe audit report should include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nSOE  procedures.  The  audited  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  9 \nmonths  after  each  fiscal  year.  The  PIUs  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the  PMO  detailing \nimplementation  activities,  physical  and  financial  accomplishments,  problems  encountered  or \nanticipated, and actions taken to resolve the problems.\n The PMO will compile quarterly reports \nfrom  the  PIUs  and  submit  the  compilation  to  ADB  for  review.  Also,  the  PMO  will  prepare \nconsolidated  project  progress  reports  twice  a  year,  following  the  project  performance  report \nformat  proposed  by  ADB  at  inception.  Within  6  months  after  project  completion,  the  PMO  will \nprepare, in coordination with the PIUs, and submit to ADB a completion report summarizing loan \nand  grant  funds  utilization,  project  implementation,  attainment  of  objectives  and  targets, \nimplementation  experience,  project  performance,  actual  costs  incurred,  benefits,  and  other \ninformation requested by ADB or GEF. Copies of annual reports, and other reports as required, \nwill be provided to GEF. \n\n23\n\nProject  Review.  The  PMO  will  submit  an  annual  work  plan  and  annual  reports  to  be \n51. \nreviewed  in  meetings  with  the  PSC,  ADB,  and  GEF,  and  will  also  be  responsible  for  the  final \nreport.  The  PMO  will  prepare  progress  reports  every  6  months,  indicating  progress,  problems \nmet  in  the  past  6  months,  remedies  taken  or  proposed,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and \nprogress expected in the next 6 months. In year 3, ADB and GEF will conduct a comprehensive \nmidterm review and detailed evaluation of the Project, including an assessment of (i) the project \ndesign and scope as formulated at appraisal; (ii) HPFD\u2019s capacity for effective implementation, \nand  PIU  effectiveness  in  implementing  the  Project;  (iii)  physical  and  financial  progress  of \nimplementation  (including  contracts  and  disbursements),  and  performance  of  consultants;  and \n(iv)  beneficiary  participation.  The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)\n will \nsupport  regular  and  timely  feedback  between  components,  as  well  as  project  performance \nreports  updated  every  6  months,  to  guide  the  adjustment  of  project  activities  to  enhance  their \neffectiveness and beneficial impact.  \n\n24\n\n52. \nAdvance  Action  and  Retroactive  Financing.  The  Government  has  requested  and \nADB  has  approved  (i)  advance  procurement  action  for  early  planting  of  seedings,  and \n(ii) retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenses  (i.e.,  ground  preparation,  seedlings  and  planting, \nand  advance  mobilization  payment  for  consultants  preparing  subproject  feasibility  reports), \nincurred  by  HPG  on  or  after  15  September  2004,  up  to  $200,000  equivalent.  HPG  has  been \n\n                                                 \n23\n\n  HPG  can  effectively  manage  its  financial  resources  and  has  already  dealt  with  several  ADB-funded  projects.  To \nstrengthen the project accounting and auditing systems and the Forest Department\u2019s capacity to manage financial \nresources, implementation support includes the services of financial management specialists. \n  The PPMS is described in detail in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n24\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nadvised  that  approval  of  advance  actions  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the proposed Project.  \n\n53. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  the  Government \nand HPG's attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders, \nsuppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standard  of  ethics  in  procuring \nand executing ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS  \n\n54. \nThe  Project  derives  its  overall  economic  rationale  from  the  need  to  protect  globally \nsignificant flora and fauna, reduce natural resource losses, achieve sustainable management of \nwetland  NRs,  and  improve  the  economic  potential  of  forest  areas  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain. \nIncreasing  the  forest  cover  and  improving  water  resource  planning  will  strengthen  wetland \nprotection  and  promote  balanced  agricultural  development  in  an  environmentally  sustainable \nmanner. More balanced allocation and use of water resources will bring local economic benefits, \nas they will help reduce flooding and drought and recharge groundwater. Restoring the wetlands \nand  protecting  endangered  species  will  increase  biodiversity  in  the  Plain.  Institutional \nstrengthening  in  forestry  and  NR  management  activities,  training,  and campaigns  to  make  the \npublic  more  aware  of  the  value  of  biodiversity  will  also  bring  substantial  incremental  global \nbenefits  over  the  long  term.  Alternative  income-generating  opportunities,  including  village \ndevelopment  plan-supported  alternative  livelihood  enterprises,  agroforestry,  and  NTFP  will \nensure  that  the  affected  communities  will  stay  away  from  natural  resources  as  their  primary \nincome  sources,  thus  promoting  sustainable  development.  Project  intervention  at  the  national \nlevel  is  further  justified  as  (i)  converting  barren  lands  to  forests,  and  (ii)  reverting  farmland  to \nlegally assigned forestland with intercropping and NTFP activities are expected to bring higher \nnet benefits. \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits \n\n25\n\n55. \nThe  financial  analysis  for  the  Project  focused  on  revenue-generating  activities:  (i) \nestablishment of new forest plantations of native species of larch and poplar, and treatment of \nexisting  forest  plantations  of  the  same  species;  (ii)  agroforestry  and  intercropping;  and \n(iii) investments  in  NTFPs,  particularly  potherbs,  berry  fruit,  and  wild  grapes.  The  overall \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project is 14.9%, which is higher than the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  6.1%.\n The  overall  project  net  present  value  (NPV)  is \nCNY124.33 million. Therefore, the proposed Project is financially viable. The FIRR and NPV by \nnature of activity and by county were also calculated. The computations show that all types of \nactivities  are  financially  viable,  and  so  are  the  operations  programmed  for  each  county.  The \nFIRR is lowest (8.8%) for new forest plantations of larch because of the long waiting period of \n20 years from planting to harvest. Hegang, Jidong, Linkou, and Qitaihe have lower FIRRs than \nother  counties,  only  slightly  more  than  10%,  because  they  are  programmed  for  planting  more \nheavily  with  larch  (yielding  lower  returns  than  poplar)  in  new  plantations  and  treated  stands. \nSensitivities  for  FIRRs  and  financial  NPVs  were  computed  at  plus  and  minus  10%  of  the  (i) \nwood  price,  (ii) wood  harvest,  (iii) investment  costs,  and  (iv)  total  costs.  The  results  show  that  \nunfavorable changes do not reduce the FIRRs below the WACC, neither in the aggregate nor in \nany particular county. A switching value analysis was conducted for wood prices, which turned \nout to be the most sensitive variable in the sensitivity analysis. A drop of 12% in wood prices will \nstill  allow  for  a  viable  operation  in  the  counties  with  the  lowest  FIRR.  Details  of  the  financial \nanalysis are in Appendix 12.  \n\n                                                 \n25\n\n The FIRR has been computed on an incremental basis, after tax in real terms. The WACC is also computed in real \nterms on an after-tax basis. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n56.   Economic  evaluation  of  the  Project  focused  on  the  economic  benefits  and  costs  of \nforestry  and  NTFP  investments.  The  significantly  positive  annualized  NPV  per  hectare  of  land \nconverted  from  currently  barren  lands  to  legally  required  forestlands  (zero  versus  CNY2,078/ \nha)  gives  strong  economic  justification  for  the  Project.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  current \ncroplands revert to the legally required forestlands, combining forest and NTFP investments to \nreplace crop cultivation opportunities lost may provide economic justification. Economic analysis \nwas  conducted  for  the  project  duration  of  25  years,  including  construction.  The  costs  and \nbenefits  were  expressed  in  yuan  in  constant  2004  prices.  In  the  case  of  economic  NPVs,  a \ndiscount  rate  of  12%  was  applied.  A  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  was  applied  to  all \nfinancial  costs  and  benefits  to  derive  the  economic  cost  and  benefit  streams.  The  economic \nwage rate of unskilled labor is 80% of the financial wage rates. The major benefits from forestry \nplantation were related to timber before tax, expressed in economic prices. Economic benefits \nderived from NTFPs were adjusted to reflect economic values based on the financial benefits. \nIncremental economic costs include investment costs and expenditures expressed in economic \nvalue  for  the  forestry  plantation  components  but  not  the  GEF-supported  investments.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  is  24.8%,  higher  than  the \neconomic  opportunity  costs  of  capital  (12%).  The  economic  NPV,  at  a  12%  discount  rate  is \nCNY93.03 million, which is positive. Therefore, the Project is economically viable. Details of the \neconomic analysis are also in Appendix 12.  \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Benefits  \n\n26\n\nThe  Project  falls  under  environmental  category  B.  An  overall  initial  environmental \n57. \nexamination  (IEE)\n was  undertaken  to  assess  the  generic  impact  of  each  Project  component. \nThe IEE shows that the Project will bring significant environmental benefits and have a positive \nimpact  on  both  the  project  area  environment  and  globally  important  biodiversity  by  increasing \nforest cover, improving wetland hydrology, restoring degraded wetlands, improving the status of \nthreatened  wildlife,  providing  wetland  conservation  education,  and  establishing  wetland \nmanagement  capacity.  The  IEE  also  shows  that  the  potential  negative  effects  on  the \nenvironment  are  localized  and  short-term  but  not  significant,  and  can  be  fully  mitigated. \nTherefore, no full environmental impact assessment is required.  \n\n58. \nThe  six  project  NRs  were  selected  because  they  support  significant  populations  of \nglobally  threatened  species,  whose  survival  depends  on  the  successful  implementation  of \ninterventions  to  remove  the  root  causes  of  problems  and  threats.  The  benefits  of  these \ninterventions\u2014predominantly conservation activities\u2014therefore accrue to the global community. \nThe benefits include (i) expanded breeding and foraging habitats of birds and other wildlife, and, \nhence, increased populations of globally threatened species; (ii) improved management at the \nlocal and watershed levels, leading to secure water resources for wetlands, support for globally \nthreatened biodiversity, and improved habitat quality, and thus to increased wildlife populations; \n(iii) increased carbon sequestration in standing wood and forest soils through reforestation and \nsustainable forest management; and (iv) minimized threats to globally endangered wildlife as a \nresult  of  greater  public  awareness  of  globally  threatened  biodiversity  and  the  importance  of \nwetlands  in  environmental  conservation.  Replicating  and  scaling  up  the  model  framework \nthroughout the Sanjiang Plain will intensify these global environmental benefits. \n\nLocal communities will benefit from restored wetland functions, such as water storage for \n59. \nuse  in  the  dry  season  and  groundwater  replenishment.  In  upland  areas,  barren  lands  and \nmarginal  agricultural  lands  will  be  put  to  more  appropriate  use,  for  forest  plantation.  The \nconversion will reduce erosion, improve water infiltration, and lead to a more reliable supply to \nstreams  and  aquifers  during  the  dry  season.  Because  of  wider  tree  spacing,  agroforestry \nintercropping  as  well  as  the  growing  of  NTFP  crops,  can  be  promoted.  Global  and  national \n\n                                                 \n26\n\n The IEE along with the environmental management plan is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n\n \n\n\fenvironmental benefits will accrue from the establishment of ecotourism guidelines that will help \nreduce adverse effects, limit inappropriate development, and ensure sustainability. Both NTFP \nenterprises  and  ecotourism  development  will  stimulate  local  employment.  The  promotion  of \nenvironment-friendly \nto \ncommunities and heighten the demonstration potential of the Project. \n\nlivelihood  enterprises  will  provide \n\nfinancial  benefits \n\nlong-term \n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty \n\n60. \nThe Project will provide employment opportunities to state farm forestry workers in tree \nplanting, stand treatment, logging, and wood transport. During the implementation period, there \nwill be work opportunities for 7 months for about 36,000 forestry workers on larch plantations, \nand for 6 months for about 10,000 forestry workers on poplar plantations. Preferential access to \nemployment and intercropping agroforestry opportunities will increase incomes for the Project\u2019s \nbeneficiary  forestry  workers.  Investments  in  various  NTFPs  such  as  potherbs,  berry  fruit,  and \nwild grapes will increase off-season income and employment benefits. \n\n61. \nIn  accordance  with  resettlement  and  village  development  plans,  about  30%  of \nresettlement  compensation  from  the  counterpart  funds  will  finance  village  development \ninvestments in alternative livelihood activities. The actual mix and scale of alternative livelihood \noutputs  in  each  village  are,  by  intent,  not  predetermined,  as  the  Project  aims  to  be  both \nparticipatory  and  flexible.  Farmers  and  villages  affected  by  wetland  restoration  activities  can \nthemselves decide the most suitable types of alternative livelihood investments, instead of being \nprovided  with  a  blueprint.  The  farmers  are  mostly  concerned  with  the  yields  and  price  of  their \ngrain  crops.  Village  development  can  add  value  to  their  farm  outputs  through  support  for \nagroprocessing businesses. The benefits of alternative enterprises under VDPs are expected to \noutweigh  simple  cash  resettlement  compensation,  as  that  result  will  (i) ensure  longer  term \nproject  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries,;  (ii)  provide  a  model  framework  that  can  be \nreplicated beyond project implementation, and (iii) assist the Government in adopting a model of \ncompensation, not as sunk cost but as sustainable investment opportunities. \n\nImpact  on  Poverty.  Poverty  incidence  is  9.7%  in  Heilongjiang  and  about  10%  in  the \n62. \nproject areas. Of the 13 project counties in the Sanjiang Plain, 4 are nationally designated poverty \ncounties (Fuyuan, Huanan, Raohe, and Tongjiang), with a slightly higher poverty incidence (15%). \nOverall, the Project will enhance livelihood enterprises in agriculture and create new economic \nopportunities  for  state  forest  workers  through  intercropping,  NTFPs,  and  VDPs.  Benefit \ndistribution  and  poverty  impact  analysis  shows  that  the  poverty  impact  ratio  of  the  Project  is \nabout 22%. The Project is classified as a \u201cGeneral intervention\u201d (Appendix 13).  \n\nEthnic Minorities. The Project\u2019s components and locations have all been identified, and \n63. \nno  significant  adverse  impact  on  ethnic  minority  villages  or  groups  is  envisaged.  Ethnic \nindividuals  who  may  be  affected  by  project  activities  will  be  compensated  and,  if  required, \nspecial measures will be included in the RPs. Based on ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, a \nfull  plan  is  not  required  but  a  specific  action  for  indigenous  peoples  is  included  in  the \nresettlement framework. \n\n64. \nGender.  Women  in  the  Project  areas  are  actively  involved  in  both  productive  activities \nand  household  chores,  except  where  physical  strength  is  required  (e.g.,  for  logging  or  wood \ntransport).  Men  and  women  have  equal  access  to  land  resources.  However,  women  are  less \nwell-represented than men are in decisions on public affairs and are burdened with household \nchores, and may, for these reasons, receive less awareness training in the value of wildlife or \nwetlands  biodiversity  conservation.  The  project  strategies  intended  to  promote  gender \nawareness and sensitivity in training and awareness programs should therefore have a positive \nimpact on women. \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nD. \n\nProject Risks \n\n65. \nThe  removal  of  threats  to  wetland  biodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  requires  the \nfollowing: (i) cooperation among resource authorities in integrating watershed management with \ndevelopment  and  conservation  planning,  (ii)  improved  NR  management  through  better-trained \npersonnel,  (iii) mutually  beneficial  relationships  between  protected  areas  and  surrounding \ncommunities,  and  (iv) sustainable  financial  support  to  NR  management.  The  project  design \nrecommends measures to minimize the risks of failure.   \n\nCooperation to Integrate Resource Management. Integrated watershed management \n66. \nis a new concept in the Sanjiang Plain. The UNDP-GEF Sustainable Use of Wetlands in China \nProject established provincial wetland management authorities (WMAs) in an attempt to foster \ncross-sector  contribution  to  wetland  biodiversity  management.  The  WMAs  were  only  partly \neffective because of their geographic and institutional distance from the wetlands. The proposed \nProject will establish local working groups in the target pilot NRs. Working group members will \nrepresent all local stakeholders in water and biodiversity resource management. \n\nImproved  NR  Management.  Barriers  to  the  success  of  the  5-year  Project  must  be \n67. \nremoved  early  on.  NR  management  standards  are  low  at  present,  partly  because  equipment \nand materials for basic functions, such as field surveys, long-term monitoring, data analysis and \nreporting, and patrol and enforcement, are lacking. NRs should be supported with appropriate \ntechnologies and their capacity should be enhanced through short- and long-term training.  \n\n68. \nAlternative  Livelihood. If the proposed activities were to impoverish or disenfranchise \nlocal communities, the Project would be less likely to succeed. To foster community support, the \nProject  will  address  the  need  for  alternative  livelihood  enterprises  at  both  forest  and  wetland \nsites. Communities will also be involved in programs to reduce NR resource exploitation and will \nparticipate in local watershed working groups. A public awareness and conservation education \nprogram will make the communities more aware of the relationship between resource protection \nand community welfare. \n\n69. \nSustainable  Financial  Support  to  NR  Management. Several factors will contribute to \nthe  sustainability  of  project  benefits  beyond  the  life  of  the  Project.  One  is  the  financial \ncommitment  of  the  Government  to  conserve  the  wetlands. Innovative  approaches  to  providing \nalternative livelihood for forest workers and the adoption of VDPs as part of RPs will enhance \nbenefits  from  investment  alternatives  rather  than  burden  the  Government  with  sunk  cost.  To \nstrengthen the financial sustainability of NR management, HPG will improve the financial returns \nfrom  forest  sector  development  through  better  management  of  existing  forests,  and  will \nsuccessively increase its yearly budget for recurrent costs of NR management from CNY0 to 2, \n4, 6, and 8 /ha during implementation.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nA.  \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the PRC Government and HPG have given the \n\n70. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\nEnvironmental issues. The HPG will ensure that  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nthe  Project  complies  with  applicable  PRC  environmental  laws  and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). \n\nHPFD,  HPG  and  county  environmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs) \nimplement \nthe  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements  as  outlined  in  the  IEE  and  the  environmental  management \nplan  (EMP);  further,  HPG  will  ensure  that  an  appropriate  budgetary \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(including  vehicles,  materials  and  equipment,  operating \nallocation \nexpenses, and staff) is provided to HPFD, HPEPB, and the county EPBs \nto  fulfill  their  responsibilities  for  implementing  mitigating  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements as outlined in the IEE and EMP; \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nbefore  starting  activities  in  components  1,  2,  and  3,  the  preparation  of \ncounty-  level  environmental  plans  for  siting  and  establishing  of  new \nplantations and operating new and existing plantations, the environmental \nmanagement  plans \nindividual \nsubprojects  will  be  subject  to  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures for subprojects outlined in the IEE and EMP; and \n\nin  each  NR,  and  all \n\nfor  recoveries \n\nadequate  budget  and  human  resources  are  made  available  for  the \nimplementation  of  EMPs  and  any  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements that may arise for the environmental assessment and review \nof subprojects. \n\nExperimental  zone  of  nature  reserves.

In converting farmland to forest, the HPG will \nensure, among others, that (a) a new forest plantation is not adjacent to or near \n(within 1 kilometer) a NR; (b) an appropriate buffer zone is maintained between \nthe  plantation  and  any  riparian  zones  or  sensitive  habitats;  (c)  affected  forestry \nworkers  and  villagers  receive  wage  income  from  tree  planting;  (d)  an  area \nequivalent to 20% of the converted farmland is used for planting NTFPs to benefit \naffected workers or villagers; (e) for the first 3-5 years, intercropping is allowed at \na  nominal  annual  contract  fee  (around  CNY6\u2013CNY7  per  mu);  and  (f)  the \nremaining  farmland  is  recontracted  to  all  workers  or  villagers  within  each  forest \nfarm, so that they share equally in the benefits. \n\nEcotourism.  In  consultation  with  ADB,  HPG  will  prepare  a  comprehensive \necotourism  master  plan  and  detailed  planning  and  environmental  guidelines  for \nthe project NRs, and make the plan and guidelines publicly available, for possible \nreplication elsewhere. \n\nEndangered species. The HPG will develop and implement a public awareness \nprogram  regarding  endangered  species,  and  strengthen  the  enforcement  of \npenalties for violations of the relevant laws and regulations. \n\nResettlement.  HPG  will  ensure  that  any  resettlement  conforms,  in  a  timely \nmanner,  to  the  relevant  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995), and the resettlement framework agreed between HPG and \nADB. The activities will include (a) preparing subproject RPs acceptable to ADB \nbefore any subproject activities and before award of civil works contracts for each \nsubproject (for the six NRs with farmland-to-wetland restoration); (b) submitting to \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n(vii) \n\nADB  for  approval  any  NR  RPs  and  VDPs  before  farmers  are  displaced  and \nbefore award of civil works contracts for each subproject; (c) submitting to ADB \nupdated  RPs  for  Qixinghe  and  Xingkaihu  after  subproject  detailed  design  and \nlivelihood development plan for ADB review and approval; (d) consulting with and \ndisclosing  subproject  RPs  to  affected  persons  and  the  public,  and  on  the  ADB \nweb site; (e) making provisions for compensation eligibility, compensation rates, \nrehabilitation measures, institutional arrangements, resettlement costs, grievance \nredress,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (f)  ensuring  that  in  relevant \nsubprojects,  compensation  and  allowances  are  paid  and  assets  are  replaced \nbefore displacement of affected people. \n\nVillage  development.  HPG  will  ensure  that  (a)  a  portion  of  the  land \ncompensation  and  resettlement  costs  under  the  Project  is  used  for  village \ndevelopment;  and  (b)  village  development  plans  for  alternative  livelihood \nschemes  and  community  infrastructure  improvements,  and  their  activities  and \nlocations  are  compatible  with  the  master  plans  for  the  NRs.  Once  a  plan  is \napproved  by  the  provincial  PMO  and  ADB,  counterpart  funds  for  village \ndevelopment will be disbursed by HPFB through the County Financial Bureau to \nthe  affected  village  committee  or  State  farm.  Financing  for  village  development \nwill  be  subject  to  guidelines  and  procedures  including  the  following:  (a)  the \nalternative  livelihood  investments  were  identified  with  the  participation  of  the \naffected persons (APs), and are eco-friendly according to the evaluation criteria \nin the EMP and compatible with the master plans for the NRs; (b) APs and then \nthe  hosts  will  have  priority  with  respect  to  use;  and  (c)  training  and  technical \nassistance for alternative livelihood schemes and environmental protection will be \nprovided  if  the  investment  proposals  fit  the  \u201cgreen,\u201d  eco-friendly  investment \ncriteria in the EMP. \n\n(viii)  Pilot  testing  and  replicability.  HPFD  will  pilot-test,  monitor,  and  evaluate  the \nfarmland-to-wetland  model  and  forestland  restoration  subprojects.  HPG  will \nensure  that  manuals  are  prepared  based  on  pilot  testing,  and  these  manuals \nincorporate  lessons  learned,  so  that  they  can  be  used  for  other  wetland \nrestoration.  HPG  will  ensure  that  such  subprojects  (including  intercropping, \nNTFPs,  and  village  development  as  part  of  resettlement  compensation)  are \nreplicable and can be scaled up, particularly in connection with the Master Plan \nfor Heilongjiang Province Wetland Restoration. \n\n(ix)  Master  Plan  for  Heilongjiang  Province  Wetland  Restoration.  HPG  will  take \nthe necessary actions to promptly obtain NDRC endorsement of the Master Plan \nand then apply the model approach developed under the Project more widely to \nrestorations under such plan, as appropriate to specific sites. \n\n(x) \n\nParticipation.  HPG  will  ensure  that  stakeholders  in  the  project  area  (including \nwomen, minority groups, and the poor) participate in project design, management, \nand implementation, including the formulation of the NR master plan, watershed \nmanagement  plan,  alternative  livelihood  programs,  ecotourism  planning  and \ndevelopment,  and  project  employment  opportunities.  HPG  shall  implement  an \nincentive  framework  to  encourage  and  maintain  stakeholder  ownership  and \nsupport  for  the  Project,  in  particular  for  the  alternative  livelihoods  development \ncomponent and conservation management activities. \n\n(xi) \n\nExit  strategy.    In  consultation  with  ADB,  HPG  will  implement  the  exit  strategy \ndeveloped under the Project to refine policy measures and carry out activities in \nintegrated watershed and wetland NR management following Project completion. \nThe  strategy  will  be  carried  out  during  Project  implementation  to  strengthen  the \n\n \n\n\foverall  sustainability  of  financing  requirements  and  sources,  capacity  building, \nand institutional mechanisms for local and intersectoral planning and cooperation. \nFor  the  financial  sustainability  of  NR  management,  HPFD,  county  forestry \nbureaus,  and  State  farms  will  successively  increase  budget  amounts  by  CNY2 \nha/yr from CNY0 ha/yr in year 1 to CNY8 ha/yr in year 5. \n\n(xii)  Counterpart  funds. The HPG will ensure the timely provision of all counterpart \nfunds  required  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,  including \nincremental  recurrent  costs,  land  compensation,  resettlement  costs  and  post \ncompletion  recurrent  costs.  The  HPG  will  ensure  that  the  counterpart  funds  for \nthe  land  compensation  and  resettlement  costs  for  the  State  farms  are  provided \nfrom the funds allocated by the central and local governments. \n\n(xiii)  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  In  consultation  with  ADB,  HPG  will  establish  and \nimplement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system,  including  performance \nindicators  relating \nforestry  development,  wetland  restoration,  NTFPs, \nresettlement and alternative livelihood schemes, counterpart financing for village \ndevelopment, ecotourism, and beneficiary participation.  HPG and ADB will carry \nout a midterm review in 2008 on issues including the implementation of the exit \nstrategy, incentive framework, and beneficiary participation. \n\nto \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n71. \nEffectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement  will  be  subject  to  the  following  special  condition: \nconfirmation  of  GEF  financing  through  the  endorsement  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the \nGEF Secretariat. \n \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n72. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\nVI. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan of $15,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Sanjiang Plain \nWetlands Protection Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard; and  \n\nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $12,140,000 \nto  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Sanjiang  Plain \nWetlands Protection Project to be provided by the Global Environment Facility. \n\n                                                                                                                  President \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \n\n \n15 February 2005 \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1         23    \n\n \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK  \n\nPerformance Indicators/Targets \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions/Risks \n\nConservation status of eight key globally \nthreatened species in the Sanjiang Plain \nlifted from the lists of endangered-to-\nvulnerable species \n\nWorld Conservation Union \nbiodiversity surveys \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nGoal: \n\nImproved management of \nnatural resources to protect \nglobally significant species \nand to sustain economic \ndevelopment \n\nPurpose: \n\nAchieve an integrated \nconservation and \ndevelopment model to \nprotect natural resources of \nthe Sanjiang Plain wetlands \nand their watersheds \n(biodiversity, water, forests), \nfrom continued threats, and \nto improve the well being of \nlocal communities \n\nBy 2010, populations of native species \nin 6 target NRs up by at least 10% \n(improved biodiversity)  \nBy 2010, nature reserve (NR) and \nwatershed water resource management \nmechanisms in the Sanjiang Plain \nestablished and/or integrate wetland \nwater requirements  \nIncome status of affected villages \nmaintained or increased through \nenvironmentally sustainable alternative \nlivelihood mechanisms \nBy 2010, wetland restoration model  \nreplicated in 5-6 additional Sanjiang \nPlain wetland NRs  \n\nOutputs: \n1.

To facilitate project design, an analysis \nidentified  the  immediate  threats  to  biodiversity,  along  with  underlying  and  root  causes  and \npossible avenues for addressing them. The outcome of the analysis is illustrated in Figure A2. \nThe indicative threats analysis is summarized in Table A2. An extensive discussion, history of \nthese threats, and an account of current threats are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n2. \nThe  indicative  threats  analysis  identified  four  main  threats  to  globally  significant \nbiodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain:  as  (i)  changes  in  hydrology/desiccation;  (ii)  conversion  to \nfarmland;  (iii)  inappropriate  practices  in  the  use  of  resources  (overexploitation  of  resources, \ndisturbances, and habitat degradation); and (iv) limited conservation awareness and capacity of \nnature  reserve  (NR)  staff  and  adjacent  communities.  Underlying  causes  of  water  pollution  are \nclosely related to incorrect use or overuse of agricultural fertilizers in their farming activities and \nfarmers\u2019 awareness on conservation. Following this analysis and the logical framework, the four \nmain  threats  (and  their  underlying  causes)  are  targeted  by  four  closely  linked  project \ncomponents, each with a set of subcomponents that address various aspects of the underlying \ncauses.   \n \nSome of the underlying causes will not be addressed by the present Project, as they are \n3. \nalready  the  focus  of  another  project  or  beyond  the  scope  of  a  GEF  intervention.  One  of  the \nunaddressed  underlying  causes  pertains  to  NR  legislation,  regulations  and  zoning,  and \ndifferences  in  how  they  are  applied  or  interpreted  at  national  and  provincial  levels.  An  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance,1  being  developed  at  present  that  will  address \nenvironmental  legislation.  The  underlying  cause  of  pressures  on  natural  resources  due  to \nincreases  in  the  human  population  is  regarded  as  being  outside  the  scope  of  a  GEF \nintervention.  \n \n\nTable

Because  of \nthis late development, threats and risks are high on some of the last remaining tracts of wetland \nand native forests with their associated biological diversity, including many endangered and rare \nspecies.   \n \n2. \nThe  PRC  gives  high  priority  to  wetland  biodiversity  conservation,  watershed  protection \nand sustainable management of natural resources. By the end of 2000 the PRC had established \n1,276 nature reserves (NRs) covering 123 million hectares (ha), or 12.4% of the national land \narea. Some 12 million ha of the total protects wetlands, representing nearly half of the estimated \ntotal of 25 million ha of natural wetlands in the PRC. The PRC ratified the Ramsar Convention \non  31  July  1992,  and  three  wetland  NRs  (Honghe,  Sanjiang,  and  Xingkaihu  NRs)  in  the \nSanjiang Plain are listed as wetlands of international importance (i.e., Ramsar sites). The PRC \nsubsequently  ratified  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  on  5  January  1993,  followed  by \nnotification  of  participation  in  the  restructured  GEF  on  16  May  1994.  The  PRC\u2019s  Biodiversity \nConservation Action Plan gives conservation of the Sanjiang Plain highest priority.  \n \n3. \nThe Sanjiang Plain (or Three Rivers Plain) is located in Heilongjiang Province in the far \nnortheastern part of the PRC. The Plain formerly extended over 108,900 (km\u00b2), with half forest \nand half wetlands, but these forest and wetlands have been reduced to one fifth of their original \narea, mainly due to the expansion of agriculture. Key wetlands and globally threatened species \nare now primarily found in NRs, but management of these areas is beset with challenges. Given \nthe presence of key populations of globally important species in the Sanjiang Plain, the Project \nis expected to have significant global environmental benefits.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  Sanjiang  Plain  has  some  of  the  PRC\u2019s  most  important  and  largest  (almost  one \nmillion ha, or 10,000 km2) floodplain wetlands. Located on this plain are 28 of Heilongjiang\u2019s 58 \nwetland  NRs  of  which  the  6  key  NRs  (Anbanghe,  Dajihe,  Naolihe,Qixinghe,  Xingkaihu,  and \nZhenbaodao) will be targeted by the Project. The six NRs support key populations of 23 species \nlisted  by  the  International  Union  for  the  Conservation  of  Nature  (IUCN)  as  globally  threatened \n(i.e.,  endangered  or  vulnerable),  and  include  breeding  populations  of  Oriental  stork,  red-\ncrowned  crane,  white-naped  crane,  Baikal  teal  and  Chinese  softshell  turtle.  The  six  support \nunique wetland habitats that have largely disappeared in the region, nowadays. \n \nIn  1998,  the  Heilongjiang  provincial  government  (HPG)  issued  a  decree  suspending \n5. \nwetland  development  in  the  province  and  preventing  further  conversion  to  farmland;  the \nsuspension  was  reinforced  in  June  2003  with  the  adoption  of  the  Regulation  on  Wetland \nConservation of Heilongjiang Province. To address losses, HPG developed plans for restoring \nof >150,000 ha (or 1,500 km2) of farmland to wetlands within wetland NRs in the Sanjiang Plain, \nand in 2003 the provincial Forestry Department began implementing of the restoration program.  \n \n6. \nThe  Project  aims  at  sustainable  management  of  natural  resources  to  protect  globally \nsignificant  species  and  promote  economic  development.  The  Project\u2019s  global  biodiversity \nobjective  is  to  protect  the  Sanjiang  Plain  wetland  ecosystems  and  their  associated  globally \nsignificant biodiversity by relieving threats and associated root causes of their decline. Globally \nsignificant  biodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  faces  four  main  threats,  namely,  (i)  changes  in \n\nRationale for GEF Involvement \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nhydrology/desiccation,  (ii)  conversion  to  farmland,  (iii)  inappropriate  land  use  practices,  and \n(iv) limited conservation awareness and capacity of NR staff and adjacent communities. These \nthreats and their underlying causes will be targeted by four interdependent Project components \n \n\nComponent 1. Outcome: NR watershed management improved. The Project \nwill increase forest cover, improve forest management (to reduce surface runoff, \nand  increasing  soil  water  retention  and  groundwater  recharge),  and  enhance \nwatershed-level water resource management.  \n\nComponent 2. Outcome: Biodiversity protection in wetland NRs enhanced. \nThe  Project  will  develop  models  and  the  capacity  for  wetland  NR  conservation \nmanagement, and embed component outputs in NR management plans.  \n\nComponent 3.  Outcome: Alternative livelihoods developed and sustained. \nThe  project  will  develop  and  implement  programs  for  sustainable  livelihood  in \nvillages  affected  by  the  reforestation  program  (under  component  1)  and \nfarmland-to-wetland  restoration  (under  component  2)1  to  ensure  that  the \nrestoration programs have lasting beneficial effects.  \n\nComponent  4.    Outcome:  Conservation  awareness  and  capacity  for \nsustainable management of wetland NR biodiversity increased. The Project \nwill  develop  and  implement  conservation  education  at  local  schools,  public \nawareness  programs  for  State  farms  and  communities  in/around  NRs;  and  a \ntargeted training program for NR staff and other stakeholders. This will be directly \nlinked  to  component  2;  for  example,  development  of  the  NR  management  plan \nand  species  recovery  plans  will  be  incorporated  into  the  long-term  training \nprogram. \n\n \nThe  Project  is  fully  compliant  with  the  GEF  operational  strategy  in  the  focal  area  of \n7. \nbiodiversity  and  consistent  with  GEF\u2019s  Operational  Program  2  (OP#2)  aimed  at  conservation \nand sustainable use of biological resources in coastal, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. The \nproject  may  further  have  linkages  with  the  other  OPs  as  sustainable  development  activities. \nHowever,  efficiencies  are  achieved  in  the  Project  by  combining  complementary  baseline  and \nincremental activities as an integrated package. Individual programs alone would contribute to \nonly  local  and  national  benefits.  But  when  integrated,  the  linkages  provided  by  sustainable \ndevelopment activities will further enhance global incremental benefits, which largely contribute \nto the objectives of OP#2. The Project will also enhance the objectives of \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOP#3 Forest Ecosystems, as a total of 11,900 ha of new forest plantations will be \nplanted  on  degraded,  unproductive  farmland  and  deforested/eroding  areas.  In \naddition, 43,700 ha of existing forestry plantations will be subjected to improved \nmanagement and upgrading; \nOP#12 Integrated Ecosystem Management, as it takes an integrated, basin wide \napproach  to  the  management  of  water  and  other  natural  resources,  and  will \nestablish an institutional framework (based on existing structures) to achieve this; \nand  \nOP#15  Sustainable  Land  Management,  as  management  of  catchments  will  be \nupgraded  and  vastly  improved  via  the  forestry  program  (i),  and  also  assist  with \n\n                                                      \n1  No physical resettlement of people is involved, but the compensation is for loss of access to farmland in the NRs. \n\nDue to readjustment of villages' remaining land, village collectives rather than individuals are affected. \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nidentifying,  developing,  and  promoting  sustainable  land  management  in  areas \nadjacent to/near the wetland protected areas.  \n\n \n8. \nThe Project aims at developing models that can be replicated to provide much-needed \nexamples for ongoing provincial programs. This approach is fully compatible with the objectives \nof  GEF\u2019s  Strategic  Priority  BD-1:  catalyzing  sustainability  of  protected  areas;  BD-2: \nmainstreaming  biodiversity  in  production  landscapes  and  sectors;  and  BD-4:  generation  and \ndissemination  of  best  practices  for  addressing  current  and  emerging  biodiversity  issues.  The \nProject will significantly contribute to BD-1, BD-2, and BD-4, as outlined in Project Contribution \nto Operational Programs and Strategic Directions of GEF Business.2  \n \n9. \nSustainability  of  benefits  and  achievements  beyond  the  completion  of  the  GEF  Project \nwill  be  positively  affected  by  (i)  promulgation  of  the  Regulation  on  Wetland  Conservation  of \nHeilongjiang Province, which took effect on 1 August 2003, and lays a solid foundation for long-\nterm  improvement  in  wetland  conservation  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain;  (ii)  financial  commitments \nconfirmed  by  HPG  for  implementing  of  the  farmland-to-wetland  and  farmland-to-forest \nrestoration  programs;  (iii)  availability  of  already  ongoing  financial  assistance  by  National \nDevelopment  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  for  affected  communities  from  the  farmland-to-\nwetland program, rather than the simple provision of funds directly as compensation; (iv) strong \ncommitment  of  the  PRC  Government  to  improve  water  resource  management,  among  others, \nby improving watershed management; (v) development of practical/workable models for wetland \nrestoration  (including  restoration  of  local  livelihood  schemes)  that  are  targeted  to  the  local \nsituation  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain;  (vi) strong  emphasis  of  the Project  on capacity  building;  this  is \nincluded  in  each  of  the  components,  especially  component  4,  which  is  entirely  focused  on \neducation, awareness education, and training, along with development of training modules and \ncurricula; (vii) emphasis on interagency collaboration under a single provincial government and \nin all project areas under the jurisdiction of Heilongjiang Province,  increases sustainability.   \n \nHPG  has  agreed  to  utilize  wetland  restoration  models  (including  livelihood  restoration) \n10. \ndeveloped  by  the  Project  in  its  farmland-to-wetland  restoration  program,  under  which  over \n150,000  ha  will  be  restored  to  wetland  NRs  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  alone.  Funds  have  been \nallocated for this replication by NDRC. The Project will facilitate the program by providing much-\nneeded examples of how restoration can be achieved successfully, and maximizing benefits to \nbiodiversity  conservation.  The  watershed-level  water  resources  management  approach  will \nprovide a model for water resources management (and allocation for conservation) to the Song-\nLiao Water Resources Commission, allowing replication in subcatchments in the entire Songhua \nRiver basin and much of northeast PRC. The production of training manuals and development \nof  training  curricula  will  facilitate  further  replicability  of  the  model  framework.  In  particular,  the \nProject will be led by one provincial government, facilitating interagency coordination of water, \nforestry, agriculture, and environmental protection departments. Thus, lessons learned will be of \ngreat  value in  the course  of  replication  in  other contexts  under  the  broader  framework  of  river \nbasin management. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nGEF  funds  the  incremental  costs  of  activities  required  to  secure  global  environmental \nbenefits  that  would  not  normally  be  undertaken  as  part  of  national  sustainable  development \n(SD) intervention. Therefore, GEF involvement is justified for activities aimed at achieving global \nenvironmental objectives (OP#2) over and above national SD costs. \n\nQuantification of GEF Contribution \n\n                                                      \n2  Supplementary Appendix O: Project Contribution to Operational Programs and Key Indicators of GEF Business \n  Plan. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nGlobal  benefits  from  the  Project  will  be  derived  from  (i)  protection  of  endangered \n12. \nspecies,  (ii)  conservation  of  ecosystems  that  are  under  threat,  and  (iii)  improved  watershed \nmanagement and wetlands habitat quality, leading to increased number of wildlife. Replicability \nof  the  project  model  framework  throughout  the  Sanjiang  Plain  will  enhance  the  global \nenvironmental benefits. Quantification of incremental costs in achieving global benefits over and \nabove  national  SD  costs  is  presented  in  Annex  B  of  the  GEF  Executive  Summary \n(Supplementary Appendix D). The key approach in quantifying GEF contribution is summarized \nbelow.  \n\nBusiness as Usual (BAU) Baseline.  The BAU baseline assumes continued investment \n13. \nby  the  Government  and  aid  agencies  in  watershed  and  water  resource  management,  nature \nconservation,  and  further  expansion  of  the  protected  area  system.  It  also  assumes  continued \n(but modest) investment by the Government in wetland restoration and reforestation, but under \nthe  following  practices:  (i)  There  will  be  an  established  network  of  wetland  NRs  and  annual \ngovernment allocations of funds to manage them. (ii) NRs would, however, continue to operate \nwithout  management  plans  and  use  approaches  that  have  proved  to  be  less  effective  at \nstemming the decline of globally important species. (iii) Recovery of globally threatened species \nwould not be accelerated unless projects are specially designed for that purpose. (iv) Existing \nprograms would restore some farmlands to wetlands, but compensation payments to displaced \nfarmers  would  not  be  designed  to  yield  long-term  economic  benefits,  nor  would  there  be  any \nincentives  for  adopting  environment-friendly  approaches  compatible  with  wetland  protection. \n(v) Water resources would be allocated first to municipalities, then to industry and agriculture; if \na  surplus  remained,  it  would  be  available  for  NR  use.  (vi)  Commercialized  tourism  facilities \nwould  be  developed  in  the  experimental  zone  of  NRs  due  to  incorrect  interpretation  of \nregulations, but this would come at a cost in terms of disturbing wetland habitat.  (vii) Lack of \ntraining  and  education  would  continue  to  hamper  NR  personnel  in  performing  their  duties. \n(viii) Communities  surrounding  NRs  would  not  be  aware  of  the  importance  of  conservation \nmanagement.  (ix)  Populations  of  globally  threatened  species  would  continue  to  decline  or  at \nbest  show  only  marginal  recovery.  (x)  Sufficient  funds  would  not  be  allocated  and  trained \npersonnel would not be available to fully protect wetland biodiversity or carry out the mandates \nof the various conservation action plans. The cost of the baseline scenario has been calculated \nat $39,850,000.  \n\nSustainable  Development  (SD)  Alternative.  The  SD  alternative  adds  to  the  BAU \n14. \nbaseline  investments  by  the  government  (including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  loan)  in \nreforestation,  and  investments  in  economic  development  in  villages  affected  by  both  the \nfarmland-to-forest  and  the  farmland-to-wetland  restoration  programs.  The  investments  will \nimprove  environmental  management  and  conditions,  but  will  be  mainly  of  national  benefit. \nImplementation  of  the  SD  alternative  over  the  5  years  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  cost \napproximately $79,510,000.   \n\nGEF Alternative.  The GEF alternative scenario adds to both the BAU baseline and SD \n15. \nalternative activities that are designed to achieve the Project\u2019s global biodiversity objectives, and \nthat  are  expected  to  generate  significant  global  benefits.  Implementation  cost  of  the  GEF \nalternative scenario over the 5 years of the Project (July 2005\u2013June 2010) is as follows. \n\nIncremental  Cost  of  GEF  Alternative.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  BAU  baseline  is \n16. \n$39,850,000;  that  of  the  SD  alternative,  $79,510,000;  and  that  of  the  GEF  alternative, \n$90,557,000. The incremental cost is $11,047,000.3 If contingencies ($1,100,000) are included, \nthe amount requested from GEF is $12.14 million.  \n\n                                                      \n3  $90.5 million minus $79.5 million equals $11.0 million, which is the base cost of the GEF financing portion. Then, \n\n$90.5 million minus $39.8 million equals $50.7 million, which is the total baseline cost of the Project. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nComponent \n1.  Watershed Management \n\n  1.

Environmental  policies  in \nHeilongjiang  Province  require  restoration  of  ecological  conditions,  especially  in  the  Sanjiang \nPlain.  Environmental  policies,  in  general,  have  substantial  impacts  on  farming  activities  in \nwetlands,  and  involve  significant  cost  implications  for  resettlement  compensation.  This  issue \nhas delayed the Government\u2019s environmental programs for wetland and forest restoration. The \nProject  will  pilot  a  livelihood  development  approach  that  will  ensure  income  opportunities  are \nrestored or improved at lower cost to the Government, and will benefit community relations with \nthe  NR  management.  The  success  of  the  approach  depends  on  the  participation  of  affected \npersons  (APs)  and  NRs  in  planning,  and  implementing  viable  and  sustainable  alternative \nlivelihood options. \n\n2. \nThe  resettlement  impacts  induced  by  the  Project  are  mainly  associated  with  the  sub-\ncomponent of farmland-to-wetland restoration. Of the total 3,433 hectares (ha) to be converted \nfrom farmland to wetland, about 1,433 ha (1,183 ha in core zones and 250 ha in experimental \nzones) will be in 5 NRs and will affect 820 persons, of whom 186 are State farm workers. Along \nwith  land  acquisition,  1,950  square  meters  (m2)  of  houses  owned  by  the  State  farm  will  be \ndemolished.  The  demolition  will  necessitate  the  physical  relocation  of  about  43  households  or \n136  individuals  who  occupy  these  shelters  during  the  farming  season.  The  other  2,000  ha  of \nfarmland in Naolihe NR has already been abandoned, but the wetland still needs to be restored. \nIn  2001,  about  318  workers  from  the  Honqiling  State  farm  were  affected  and  provided \nreplacement  farmland  in  nearby  villages.  An  assessment  of  the  situation  found  that  the  state \nfarm  has  already  restored  the  livelihood  schemes  and  incomes  of  these  people.  Under  the \nProject,  the  abandoned  land  would  be  restored  to  wetland,  and  the  State  Farm  (or  villages \naffected)  would  be  eligible  for  compensation  funding  for  alternative  livelihood  development.  In \n13 counties, 10,800 ha of land will revert to its original legal use as commercial forest, of which \n4,300  ha  is  currently  being  farmed  by  1,770  forest  workers  in  28  State  forest  farms  and  447 \nfarmers in 12 villages; these workers are employees of State forest farms and are contracted to \nattend to the lands with salary payments. No minority villages or groups will be affected by the \nProject.  However,  the  subproject  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  will  verify  whether  any  individual \nethnic minority people will be affected by resettlement. \n \nB.  \n\nLegal Framework \n\n3. \nPeople are strictly prohibited from living in the core zone of wetland NRs. Those who are \npresently  farming  in  the  core  zone  of  the  wetland  NRs  will  be  relocated  immediately  and  all \nproductive activities will stop. Those who live in the buffer zone should move out step by step.4 \nAccording to the Chinese Land Administration Law, land acquisition caused by an infrastructure \nproject will require the developer to pay compensation to the current land owners/users. For this \nProject,  the  impacts  caused  by  ecological  restoration  are  in  accordance  with  the  wetland \nprotection  regulation  by  which  land  use  rights  are  restricted,  and  there  may  be  no  transfer  of \n\n                                                 \n1  The  13  counties  are  Baoqing,  Boli,  Fuyuan,  Hegang,  Huanan,  Hulan,  Jixian,  Linkou,  Luobei,  Mishan,  Ningan, \n  Qitahe, and Raohe. \n2  The six prefectures are Hegang, Jiamusi, Jixi, Mudanjiang, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan. \n3  Anbanghe NR, Dajiahe NR, Naolihe NR, Qixinghe NR, Xingkaihu NR, and Zhenbaodao NR. \n4  The Heilongjiang Provincial Wetland Protection Regulation (2003). \n\n\f44 \n\n   Appendix 8 \n\nlandownership. The Nature Reserve Protection Regulation of PRC, Article 27 states, \u201cFor those \npeople who live in the core zone of nature reserve, the local government should resettle them \nappropriately.\u201d  But  there  is  no  detailed  regulation  of  land  compensation  rates  about  farmland \nrestoration to wetland. According to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement, if any project causes individuals or a community to lose all or part of their land, \nhousing,  infrastructure,  resources, income  sources,  and  services,  they  will  be  compensated  in \ncash or kind so that their economic and social circumstance will be at least restored to the pre-\nproject level. Thus, all compensation is based on the principle of replacement cost.5 \n\nFor  the  farmland-to-forest  restoration,  there  is  potential  for  loss  of  incomes  during  the \n4. \nyears that the trees are growing. The standard practice in the People's Republic of China is to \nprovide  an  annual  subsidy  of  100  kilograms  of  grain  and  CNY20  in  cash  to  local  farmers  for \neach mu (1/15 ha) of farmland converted to forestland, for 8 years for natural forest or 5 years \nfor commercial forest.6 This practice is considered costly and welfare oriented, and may not fully \nrestore  lost  incomes.  Therefore,  under  this  Project,  a  different  approach  has  been  taken\u2014the \nProject will finance the planting of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for people affected by the \nconversion.  They  will  receive  replacement  forestland  and  wages  for  tree  planting,  and \nsimultaneously  implement  intercropping  for  3-5  years  on  the  newly  planted  forest  area  at  a \nnominal fee of CNY6-7/mu/year (or land contracting fees may be  waived). In this manner, the \naffected people will be able to maintain or even increase their income from the land. The project \nwill finance the NTFP for these people at the estimated cost of CNY35.92 million ($4.34 million). \n\n5. \nThe Heilongjiang Provincial Government (HPG) will ensure that any resettlement under \nthe Project is carried out in accordance with relevant PRC laws and regulations, ADB's Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  and  the  resettlement  framework \nagreed  upon  by  HPG  and  ADB  (including  the  provisions  on  eligibility  for  compensation, \ncompensation  rates,  rehabilitation  measures,  institutional  arrangements,  resettlement  costs, \nconsultation, disclosure and grievance redress, and monitoring and evaluation). For the six NRs \nwith farmland-to-wetland restoration, RPs with village-level resettlement and development plans \nmust  be  disclosed  to  APs,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  the  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts or displacement of farmers. \n \nC. \n\nEligibility for Compensation \n\n6. \nAll APs, regardless of their legal status, will be compensated and rehabilitated. Lack of \nlegal  documents  of  their  customary  rights  or  occupancy  certificates  will  not  bar  them  from \nobtaining  compensation.  The  resettlement  policy  will  apply  to  all  components  of  the  Project \nregardless of whether or not they are directly financed by ADB. Particular attention will be paid \nto  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups  among  those  affected,  especially  the  poor,  the  elderly, \nwomen, and children. Based on the principle of replacement cost, the annual income loss from \nland will be the annual net output value. The dry land compensation rate is CNY2,500/mu, and \nthe  paddy  compensation  rate  is  CNY3,500/mu.  The  compensation  rates  for  houses  will  be \nCNY700/m2. \n \nD. \n\nRehabilitation Measures \n\nAfter  land  acquisition,  the  affected  villages  or  State  farms  will  readjust  the  farmland \n7. \nwithin  the  groups,  thus  ensuring  that  the  APs  obtain  adequate  farmland  to  replace  lost  crop \nproduction. Development of alternative livelihood programs will be encouraged as part of the RP \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

The affected houses belong to the State Farm, so the house compensation will be paid to \nthe farm directly, and the farm will select the new site outside the NR, rebuild the new houses, \nand  then  allocate  them  to  all  affected  families.  In  addition,  a  transfer  and  transportation \nallowance and cash compensation for loss of other private properties will be provided to each \nhousehold. Xingkaihu State Farm will be responsible for site preparation, electricity connection, \nwater supply, and road construction.  \n \n9. \nFor those who will be affected by farmland conversion to forestland, landownership will \nnot  be  transferred.  The  affected  workers  or  villagers  will  receive  wages  for  tree  planting  and \nmaintenance and can share in the profits of forestry. Due to the long period for trees to mature, \nthe APs will be permitted to practice intercropping between the seedlings for 3-5 years. Also, the \nProject will develop at least 860 ha of NTFPs for the APs to ensure incomes will be maintained \nor increased. In addition, villagers can benefit from the subsidy policy (footnote 6) of the central \nGovernment and the provincial governments. \n \nE. \n\nResettlement Cost and Funding \n\n10. \nAbout $9.16 million (CNY75.8 million) of the $24.37 million government counterpart fund \nwill  be  required  to  pay  for  resettlement,  i.e.,  compensation,  physical  resettlement,  and  village \ndevelopment. HPG will set up an account for the resettlement costs (compensation and village \ndevelopment),  which  will  be  managed  by  the  Heilongjiang  Province  Financial  Bureau  (HPFB). \nAfter  the  VDP  is  approved,  HPFB  will  disburse  the  fund  to  the  affected  village  committee  or \nState  farm  through  the  County  Financial  Bureau.  The  funds  for  land  compensation  and \nresettlement have been guaranteed by HPG. The proposed funding sources are the Provincial \nWetland Restoration Fund and the central Government fund of the State Farm Bureau.  \n \nF. \n\nInstitutional Arrangement for Resettlement \n\nConsultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\n11. \nCounty-level project implementation units (PIUs) under the Forestry Department will be \nset up and be responsible for supervising RP preparation and implementation. The county land \nadministration bureaus will assist the county management office to implement the RP, and will \nbe responsible for land inventory and acquisition approvals.  \n \nG. \n \nConsultation with the APs has taken place in the early process of resettlement planning. \n12. \nThe draft RPs have been disclosed to the county and township offices and the affected villages. \nA  resettlement  information  booklet  for  two  draft  RPs  has  been  distributed  to  the  affected \nvillagers.  Further  information  will  be  provided  to  all  APs  before  implementation.  Such \nconsultation  and  participation  will  be  continued  throughout  the  planning  and  implementation \nprocess. A formal mechanism for grievances will be established, in addition to standard informal \nprocedures. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Tentatively, 30% will be utilized for livelihood development. \n\n\f46 \n\n   Appendix 8 \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nProcedural Guidance for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n\nH. \n \n13. \nFollowing  the  requirements  of  ADB,  there  will  be  both  internal  and  external  monitoring \nand  evaluation  of  both  the  farmland-to-wetland,  and  the  farmland-to-forestland  programs.  The \naim is to ensure that all APs are compensated adequately and timely, and assess whether their \nincomes and livelihood are restored after resettlement and rehabilitation. Each county PIU will \ncarry out internal monitoring and report to the project management office (PMO) and ADB. For \nexternal monitoring and evaluation, the PMO will engage an independent institution such as a \nuniversity  or  a  social  research  institute.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  cover  the  progress  of \nimplementation,  compliance  with  resettlement  policies,  delivery  of  compensation  funds, \nallocation of replacement land, changes in income and livelihood among APs, consultation, and \nparticipation.  \n \nI. \n \n14. \nFor  the  farmland-to-wetland  restoration  component,  a  resettlement  framework  and  two \npreliminary RPs for Xinkaihu NR and Qixinghe NR have been prepared for ADB approval. The \nreason for the resettlement framework is the need for a community-based process to formulate \nalternative livelihood schemes as the basis for resettlement. Further consultation with the APs \nand  with  the  NR  PIUs  will  be  carried  out  to  formulate  VDPs.  This  approach  will  ensure  that \nviable and sustainable alternative livelihood schemes are developed to offset lost income from \nfarming, especially activities that are compatible with wetland protection. It will take time to set \nup  the  PIUs,  strengthen  the  staff  of  NRs,  and  prepare  VDPs  for  the  affected  villages.  The  six \nsubprojects RPs (two draft RPs and four new RPs) will require further community consultation \nand  participation  of  villagers,  local  officials,  and  NR  staff  to  identify  and  agree  on  alternative \nlivelihood  schemes.  VDPs  will  specify  (i)  where  the  compensation  funds  will  be  invested,  (ii) \nwhat  activities  will  be  established  under  resettlement  compensation  counterpart,  according  to \nthe  VDP  agreed  upon,  and  (iii)  how  the  village  collectives  and  affected  farmers  will  share  the \nbenefits  from  the  planned  village  development  activities.  The  proposed  activities  should  meet \nenvironmental  and  income-generating  criteria.  The  VDPs  should  be  approved  by  the  PMO  of \nHPG  and  ADB,  before  the  State  farm  or  village  committee  receives  the  compensation  and \nbefore  displacement  of  farmers  from  the  NRs.  The  Project  will  provide  some  technical \nassistance in formulating VDPs and consultations.  \n \nJ. \n \nThe project implementation schedule will be refined during the first year of the Project. \n15. \nHowever,  resettlement  planning  will  be  carried  out  once  the  Project  is  approved.

The Project has five components: (i) watershed management, \n(ii)  wetland  nature  reserve  management,  (iii)  alternative  livelihood,  (iv)  education  and  capacity \nbuilding,  and  (v)  project  implementation.  Wetland  nature  reserve  management  is  largely \nassociated with global environmental benefits, while subcomponents of watershed management \n(forest improvement) and alternative livelihood (nontimber forest product [NTFP] intercropping) \ncomponents  will  generate  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  based  mainly  on  the  benefits \nand costs associated only with national benefits. The financial cash flows and economic value \nflows were estimated on an incremental basis. \n\n2. \nThe proposal is to use 55,600 hectares (ha) of land for forestry improvement\u201411,900 ha \nfor  new  plantations  and  43,700  ha  for  treatment  of  existing  stands\u2014and  2,380  ha  for  NTFPs. \nAbout 25% of forestry improvement will involve poplar, and the rest, larch. The plantations will \ncost  CNY55  million;  treatment,  CNY129  million;  and  NTFPs,  CNY35  million.  The  Project  will \nhave  a  total  cost  of  CNY420  million,  excluding  contingencies,  and  a  construction  period  of  5 \nyears (from mid-2005 to mid-2010). The Project will use funds from ADB, Global Environment \nFacility (GEF), and the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), as well as labor \ninputs from State forest farm workers. These sources can be categorized into three: debt (ADB \nloan), equity (GEF and labor input), and government funds. GEF and labor input are treated as \nequity  because  they  are  assumed  to  have  the  same  required  rate  of  return.  The  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC)\u2014the  weighted  sum  of  estimates  of  the  cost  of  debt,  cost  of \ngovernment funds, and cost of equity\u2014is 6.11%. \n \nB.  \n\nLeast Cost Analysis of Alternatives \n\nThe  Project  provides  a  major  opportunity  to  examine  the  possibility  of  reducing  tree \n3. \nplanting  density,  thereby  improving  the  economic  efficiency  of  forest  plantations  over  current \npractices.  Both  provincial  and  county  reports  were  reviewed  very  thoroughly,  and  numerous \ndiscussions  were  held  with  technical  staff  of  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Forestry  Department. \nForest plantation practices in Heilongjiang Province are based on traditional standards, which in \nthis particular case involve narrow spacing with one thinning for larch and no thinning for poplar. \nTwo options with varied spacings and tending costs were compared, and the spacing distance \nof 2 meters (m) x 2.5m for larch (2,000 stems/ha) and poplar (1,250 stems/ha) was selected to \nallow wider spacing between trees\u2014and therefore lower plantation and tending costs\u2014with one \nthinning for both larch (at age 12) and poplar (at age 6). The financial and economic analyses \nare based on this option, as it lowered plantation and tending costs and added the opportunity \nfor NTFPs. \n \nC.  \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n4. \nFocusing on Revenue-generating Activities. The activities include (i) establishing new \nforest plantations of native species of larch and poplar, (ii) treating of existing forest plantations \nof  the  same  species,  and  (iii)  producing  NTFPs.  The  assumptions  in  computing  the  financial \ninternal  rate  of  returns  (FIRRs)  and  net  present  values  (NPVs)  and  the  results  of  the  financial \nanalysis  are  as  follows.  The  incremental  cash  flow  for  the  financial  analysis  includes  sales \nrevenue from commercial forestry and NTFP development. Final harvest volume projections per \nhectare are based on a 20-year rotation (with one thinning at age 12) for larch, and a 10-year \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51\n\nrotation  (with  one  thinning  at  age  6)  for  poplar.  The  Faustmann  model1  was  used  to  estimate \noptimal  rotation  years  for  poplar  and  larch,  using  the  WACC  as  a  discount  rate  for  maximum \nNPV with a single rotation during the Project. Net thinning volumes removed are 9 cubic meters \n(m3)/ha for larch and 22 m3/ha for poplar, while final harvest net volume removals are 115 m3/ha \nfor  larch  and  99  m3/ha  for  poplar.  These  volume  parameters  were  applied  to  both  new  and \nexisting plantations. New forest plantations and stand treatment operations will take place in all \n13 project counties. It is assumed that most of the total net volume of larch and poplar will be \nold to pulp mills, while some will be sold as mine pit props and as raw material for other wood \nproducts.  County  reports  and  additional  surveys  indicate  larch  prices  of  CNY400/m3  at  final \nharvest  and  CNY300/m3  at  thinning,  and  poplar  prices  of  CNY380/m3  at  final  harvest  and \nCNY350/m3 at thinning. \n\nEstimated  Costs  and  Expenditures  for  Plantations.  Per  hectare,  cost  structures  for \n5. \nnew  forest  plantations  add  up  to  CNY5,200  for  larch  and  CNY4,600  for  poplar,  and  treatment \ncosts for existing plantations total CNY3,500/ha for both larch and poplar. These cost structures \ninclude overhead costs based on general and administrative expenses directly connected to the \nplantation operations under the proposed project. Additionally, the cost of goods sold includes \nlogging and transportation costs. Logging cost is assumed at CNY170/m3 for larch thinning, and \nCNY140/m3  for  felling;  and  CNY140/m3  for  poplar  thinning  and  CNY  110/m3  for  poplar  felling. \nTransportation  cost  is  assumed  at  CNY12.5/m3  for  both  species.  Additional  financial  charges \ninclude a plantation fund surcharge and a sales tax. The plantation fund surcharge is estimated \nat 10% of sales revenue, which is the current effective in the PRC. Sales taxes for timber raw \nmaterial and surcharges are estimated at 5% of sales revenue. Price contingencies and interest \nduring the construction period are excluded from the financial analysis. In treatment of existing \nplantations,  it  is  assumed,  on  the  basis  of  the  with  and  without  principle,  that  untreated \nplantations  would  have  30%  of  the  harvest  value  of  a  healthy  plantation  on  account  of  much \ndeadwood, small diameters, trees with poor form, and damage from insects and diseases. \n\n6. \nFinancial Assumptions for NTFPs. In addition to timber products, three NTFPs (berry \nfruit,  wild  grape,  and  potherbs)  will  be  planted  in  the  commercial  forestry  plantations.  While \nforestry  operations  will  take  place  in  all  13  project  counties,  only  those  counties  with  new \nplantations  will  participate  in  NTFP  production.  These  are  Boli  for  berry  fruit;  Huanan  for  wild \ngrape; and Baoqing, Hulin, Linkou, and Luobei for potherbs. The NTFP yields are projected very \nconservatively in light of spotty information obtained in the field. A price of CNY2/kg for all three \nproducts  was  assumed.  The  cost  of  harvesting  has  been  projected  at  CNY1/kg  and \ntransportation  cost  at  CNY42/metric  ton,  assuming  an  average  distance  to  markets  of  50 \nkilometers NTFP sales are subject to a 7% sales tax on agricultural products. The project life is \nreleased at the end of the Project for commercial forestry and NTFP development. The WACC \nwas calculated as 6.11%, which is used for calculating the financial NPV of the Project. \n\n7. \nResults  of  Financial  Analysis.  The  overall  FIRR  of  the  Project  is  14.93%.  Detailed \ncalculations  are  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  P.  The  NPV  evaluated  at  the  WACC  is \nCNY124 million, which is greater than zero. Since the FIRR is higher than the WACC and the \nNPV  is  positive,  the  proposed  Project  is  financially  viable  under  the  above  assumptions.  The \nFIRR  and  NPV  by  activity  and  by  county  were  also  calculated  and  the  results  are  shown  in \nTable A12.1. An important conclusion from the calculations is that all types of activities included \nare financially viable, and so are the operations programmed for each county. Treating existing \nplantations has a higher FIRR than establishing new ones. The main reasons are that existing \nplantations have the advantage of a sunk cost from their original planting, treatment costs are \n\n                                                 \n1  The Faustmann analysis shows that larch can reach maximum NPF at 20 years as the optimal rotation year. For \n  poplar, the optimal rotation year is chosen at 20 years from the analysis, since there are not enough historical data \n \n\nto show the maximum output level. \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nlower  that  plantation  costs,  volume  outputs  from  treatment  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  as \nthose from new plantations, and benefits are reaped more quickly from treated plantations than \nfrom  new  ones.  Additionally,  the  FIRR  for  treat  poplar  is  higher  than  that  for  treating  larch, \nmainly  because  the  waiting  period  with  poplar  is  shorter.  This  is  so  even  after  considering  an \nopportunity cost of 30% of harvest value if the stand were left untreated. Among the counties, \nHegang, Jidong, Linkou, and Qitahe show FIRRs slightly in excess of 10%, while Raohe has the \nhighest FIRR, at more than 29%. The first four counties are heavy in larch and new plantations \nand  treatment,  while  Raohe  has  major  areas  of  poplar  treatment.  The  three  NTFPs  are  also \nshown  to  be  profitable,  with  FIRRs  from  12.2%  to  22.78%,  based  on  the  current  market  data \nanalysis. \n\n8. \nFIRRs  and  financial  NPV  sensitivities  were  tested  at  plus  and  minus  10%  for  the \nfollowing  variables:  (i)  wood  prices,  (ii)  wood  final  harvest  volumes,  (iii)  investment  costs,  and \n(iv)  all  costs.  The  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  major  components  shows  that  the  10%  changes, \nwhen unfavorable, do not reduce the FIRRs below the WACC, neither in the aggregate nor in \nany particular county. While the Project is most sensitive to wood prices, it remains quite robust \nat  a  10%  change  in  any  of  these  variables.  The  sensitivity  analysis  is  summarized  in  Table \nA12.2.  Switching-value  analysis  was  conducted  for  wood  prices,  which  turned  out  to  be  the \nmost sensitive variable in the sensitivity analysis. Even with a drop of 12% in wood prices, the \ncounties with the lowest FIRR could still have a viable operation. \n \nD.  \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n9. \nThe GEF-supported activities emphasize global environmental values such as protection \nof  globally  endangered  species.  Various  components  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  generate \neither  global  environmental  benefits  national  environmental  benefits,  or  both.  However,  the \neconomic  evaluation  of  the  Project  is  conducted  from  the  perspective  of  national  benefits  to \nassess its investment rationale.  \n\nEconomic Benefits Related to Forestry and NTFP Investments. The major economic \n10. \nbenefits  from  forestry  plantation  are  the  cash  inflow  from  timber  production,  expressed  in \neconomic prices, as well as plantations, new seedlings, and maturing trees providing improved \nsoil cover. Other related benefits include watershed improvement, flood control, protection from \nsoil  erosion,  and  potential  production  of  other  NTFPs.  Flood  control  benefits  may  often  be \nestimated on the basis of flood damage avoided or minimized, especially in public and private \ninfrastructure  and  in  industrial  and  agricultural  outputs.  In  the  proposed  Project,  flood  control \nbenefits can take the form of reduction in losses of agricultural output. The proposed plantations \nwill  also  help  the  PRC  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  while  protecting  watershed  and \nwetland biodiversity.2 However, these other benefits are not easily quantified and for this reason \nwere  not  included  in  the  economic  analysis.  Economic  benefits  derived  from  NTFPs  were \nconverted from financial benefits, but valued at prices before tax. \n\nInvestments.  The \n\nEconomic  Benefits  Related  to  GEF-Supported \n\nfour  other \n11. \ncomponents are designed to improve global environmental values through various interventions, \nincluding  those  that  will  produce  marketable  products  as  well  as  secondary  benefits. \nRehydrating the wetlands will recharge the groundwater, moderate stream flows (thus mitigating \nfloods and drought), reverse changes in the microclimate, and protect the water supply, among \nother  benefits.  Recreational  activities  can  include  nature  observation,  bird  watching,  and \ncamping.  But  biodiversity/and  critical  habitat  benefits,  although  they  could  be  substantial,  are \n                                                 \n2 Like other trees, larch and poplar sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during their natural growth. It has \n  been  estimated  that  forests  can  sequester  more  than  0.5  million  tons  of  carbon  over  their  rotation  periods. \n  However,  the  value  of  sequestered  carbon  is  highly  variable  since  the  market  for  this  commodity  has  not  been \n  established, and is therefore not used in this analysis. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n53\n\nnot  easily  valued,  especially  since  they  are  based  on  non-use  values.  Hence,  only  economic \nbenefits related to plantation, treatment, and NTFPs are included in the economic analyses. \n\n12. \nEconomic  Costs  and  Other  Technical  Parameters.  Basic  costs  and  prices  are  the \nsame  as  those  used  in  the  financial  analysis.  However,  all  financial  values  were  adjusted  to \nreflect  economic  values.  A  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  was  applied  to  all  costs  and \nbenefits other than labor. For labor, a shadow wage rate of 0.8 was applied. Taxes (5% sales \ntax  on  timber,  10%  plantation  fund  surcharge  on  total  timber  revenue,  and  7%  sales  tax  on \nNTFPs)  were  excluded  from  the  economic  calculations.  In  the  case  of  economic  NPVs,  a \ndiscount  rate  of  12%  was  applied.  Incremental  economic  costs  of  the  Project  include \nexpenditures  expressed  in  economic  values  for  forestry  plantations,  but  not  for  the  GEF-\nsupported  investment  costs  and  subsequent  cash  outflows.  The  analysis  was  conducted  for  a \nproject life of 25 years, including the construction period, which is conservative for the types of \nenvironmental benefits. Costs and benefits are expressed in yuan, in constant 2004 prices. \n\n13. \nOpportunity  Cost  of  Land  Converted  to  Forest  Plantation.  Two  types  of  land  are \nacquired  to prepare  sites  for  plantations.  One  is  barren  land  owned  by  the  State  forest  farms, \nwith  an  opportunity  cost  of  zero.  The  second  type  is  land  in  State  forest  farm  territory  but \ncurrently  being  cultivated  for  crop  production,  mainly  to  provide  partial  welfare  as  off-season \nwork  to  employees,  or  to  retired  former  employees  of  the  State  forest  farms.  Nevertheless, \ncurrent  regulations  severely  restrict  crop  production  on  forestlands.  These  lands,  if  cultivated, \nmust  revert  to  forests.  The  opportunity  cost  of  these  lands  reverting  to  forests  is  lost  crop \nproduction.  In  the  Sanjiang  Plain  the  marginal  loss  of  crop  production  has  been  estimated  at \nCNY938/ha, or RMB63/mu. NTFP production was designed to offset this lost crop revenue for \nthose who previously cultivated the land. Table A12.3, which compares the NPVs of plantation, \nNTFP production, and crop production (per year on average), shows that NTFP is sufficient to \noffset lost crop revenue and that plantation forests have positive NPV. \n \n\nTable A12.3: NPV Per Hectare for Various Land Use Options (yuan; 12% discount rate) \n \n\nLand Use Options \nBarren land \nPlantation \nNTFP \nTotal Forestry (Plantation + NTFP) \nCrop Production \nNPV = net present value, NTFP = nontimber forest product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimate \n \n\nNPV/ha \n0 \n2,078 \n8,939 \n11,017 \n7,406 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n14. \nEIRR  and  ENPV  Calculations.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the \nProject  as  a  whole  is  24.8%,  which  is  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \n(12%).  The  economic  net  present  value  (ENPV)  at  12%  discount  rate  is  CNY93.03  million, \nwhich  is  positive.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  viable  from  the  economic  point  of  view.  The  EIRR \nand ENPV for different activities and for all the counties are summarized in Table A12.1. \n\n15. \nSensitivity  Analysis  for  EIRR  and  ENPV.  Sensitivity  analyses  conducted  in  the \neconomic analysis of the same variables as in the financial analysis show that the Project is not \nonly  financially  but  also  economically  robust.  All  the  counties  continue  to  have  economically \nviable operations despite unfavorable changes of up to 10% in the variables considered. (Table \nA12.2). Additionally, switching-value analysis indicates that, to reduce the EIRR to below 12% \nfor  the  lowest-performing  counties  (Hegang,  Jidong,  Linkou,  and  Qitahe),  wood  prices  would \nhave to drop by more than 15%. \n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nLabor  and  Impact  on  Poverty.  In  addition  to  the  cited  economic  benefits,  the  Project \n16. \nalso provides farmers with employment opportunities in tree planting, stand treatment, logging, \nand  wood  transport.  Once  the  plantations  are  mature,  there  will  be  further  employment \nopportunities in harvesting, conversion, and use of forest products, especially wood. Assuming \n55,600 ha of forestry operations (both new plantations and treated plantations remain under tree \ncover and labor-intensive methods are used for forestry operations), about 10,000 full-time jobs \ncan be created in planting, treatment, logging, and transport to woodyards (7 months for about \n36,000 forestry workers on larch plantations, and 6 months for about 10,000 forestry workers on \npoplar plantations). \n \n\nTable A12.1: Summary of FIRR and EIRR by Investment Type and by County \n\nEconomic NPV \n(CNY million) \n\n \n\nEIRR (%) \n\n    FIRR (%)  Financial NPV (CNY) \n\nItem \n Plantation \n     Larch \n     Poplar \n Treatment \n     Larch \n     Poplar \n NTFP \n     Berry Fruit \n     Wild Grape \n     Portherb \nTotal \n \nCounty \nBaoqing \nBoli \nFuyan \nHegang \nHuanan \nHulin \nJidong \nJixian \nLinkou \nLuobei \nMishan \nQitaihe \nRaohe \nTotal \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, \nNTFP = nontimber forest product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n \n12.62 \n29.74 \n \n17.50 \n74.17 \n \n35.33 \n24.39 \n25.38 \n24.77 \n \n \n36.60 \n25.82 \n38.87 \n16.15 \n27.14 \n33.06 \n16.18 \n24.79 \n16.02 \n17.24 \n33.31 \n15.92 \n51.39 \n24.77 \n\nTable A12.2 Summary of the Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\nFIRR (%) \n\nFNPV (CNY million)\n\nEIRR (%) \n\nENPV (CNY million)\n\nItem \n\nWood Price -10% \n\nWood Harvest Volume -10% \nInvestment Cost +10% \nTotal Costs +10% \n\n11.34 \n\n13.76 \n14.02 \n11.07 \n\n65.72  \n\n103.01  \n117.11  \n70.26 \n\n21.66 \n\n23.69 \n23.61 \n21.16 \n\n64.80 \n\n81.42 \n89.11 \n69.10 \n\n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value, FIRR = financial economic \ninternal rate of return, FNPV = financial net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n55\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of  the  sector  or  subsector  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC):  Through \nplantation,  treatment  of  existing  plantations,  development  of  nontimber  forest  products,  many  employment \nopportunities and diversified and more sustainable livelihood opportunities will be available to poor forest workers and \nfarmers, as well as minority groups and women. The development of alternative livelihood schemes will also help the \npoor shift to sustainable use of natural resources while generating income, thus reducing the poor households' wanton \ncultivation  of  environmentally  fragile  areas  of  the  Sanjiang  Plain.  In  the  medium  to  long  -term,  they  can  also  benefit \nfrom the high returns from forest plantations when these reach maturity. With farmland conversion to wetland and the \nestablishment and rejuvenation of natural reserves, the  local vulnerable  environment  will be  improved,  which  in turn \nwill  reduce  the  occurrence  of  natural  disasters  such  as  flooding,  and  will  improve  the  yield  performance  of  poor \nhouseholds  that  are  producing  nontimber  products.  The  proposed  Project\u2019s  good  practices  in  the  development  of \nsustainable  livelihood  options,  plantation  of  forest  products,  treatment  of  existing  plantations,  and  sustainable \ndevelopment of nature reserves can serve as models that may be replicated in the PRC\u2019s other environmentally fragile \nareas with a poor population base. \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe national-level official rural poverty lines for Heilongjiang Province are RMB1,300 per capita net annual income for the \npoverty villages and RMB1,000 RMB per capita net annual income for the poverty households (which is comparable to \nthe ADB\u2019s poverty threshold for the country). Of the 13 cities and counties of the Project in the Sanjiang Plain, there are \nthree  nationally  designated  poverty  counties  (Raohe,  Huanan,  and  Fuyuan).  The  rural  poverty  population  in  these \ncounties  is  388,692  persons,  accounting  for  15%  of  the  total  poverty  population  of  the  province.  Poverty  incidence  is \n9.7% in Heilongjiang and 9.19% in the directly affected project area. Therefore, there is no severe poverty issue in the \ndirectly affected project areas, and this Project is classified as \u201cgeneral intervention.\u201d \n \nCompared with the average household in the province, poor households in the poverty villages of the project area obtain \ntheir income from farming and have less income from livestock and migrant labor. Many of the poor farmers in the project \narea live in and around the nature reserve (NR). They depend primarily on earnings from the cultivation of land from the \nnature reserve that have been converted to farmland or from work in the state forestry/agricultural farms that are located \nin  or  adjacent  to  the  NRs.  Some  of  these  farmers  (referred  to  as  permanent  residents)  have  obtained  long-term  user \nrights of arable land that have been allocated to them by the village committees. Other farmers (or contract farmers) who \nare not recognized by the local governments as local residents of the area obtained short-term contracts to farmland plots \nowned by state forest and agricultural farms. Aside from these poor farm households, about 10% of the total households \nin the state forest and agriculture farms can be considered poor. The income sources of these poor households are 60% \nfrom  farming,  10%  from  collecting  agarics,  mushrooms,  and  wild  vegetables  gathered  from  the  NR  area,  10%  from \nforest/agriculture farm salaries, and 20% from other sources such as animal husbandry and fruit trees. Because of the \nvarious  national  and  provincial  policies  to  protect  forestry  and  wetland  resources,  incomes  of  forest  workers  have \ndeclined  through  the  years  as  their  tasks  have  been  limited  largely  to  tending  the  trees  and  to  tree  planting. \nUnderemployment  is  high,  with  a  typical  farm  worker  providing  about  3-4  months  of  work  in  a  year  and  earning \nRMB2,500 for that work.   \n \nThough poverty is not extensive, a key cause of income poverty is the limited livelihood opportunities both on-farm and \noff-farm. Where there is work in the state forest/agriculture farms, these are more and more being constrained by public \npolicies that protect and conserve the already fragile and limited forestry and wetland areas of the Sanjiang Plain. With \nlimited skills for other income-earning activities and constraints to credit access, poor farm households and workers tend \nto be averse to changing their farming work, which at present provides them secure and stable income, despite the more \nfrequent occurrence of natural disasters (like drought,  waterlogging, flood, early forest, and soil erosion) that adversely \nimpact their farm income. \n \nThe  other  disadvantaged  groups  in  the  project  area  include  women  and  minority  groups.  Not  only  do  women  perform \nhousehold chores; they are also engaged  in productive activities.  Women contribute 50%, 70%, and 60% of  forest,  \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nagarics,  and  crop  production.  In  crop  (mainly  rice,  corn,  and  soybeans)  production,  women  take  about  60%  of  the \nworkload  in  preparing  the  land  planting,  weeding,  applying  fertilizer,  and  harvesting.  In  logging  operations,  women  are \nresponsible  for  cutting  limbs,  preparing  fuelwood,  and  tending  trees.  About  two  thirds  of  those  employed  in  the  paper \nprocessing  and  other  agroprocessing  facilities  are  women.  Because  of  their  huge  contribution  to  farming  and  forestry-\nrelated  activities,  women  often  make  decisions  in  their  respective  households  over  the  sale  of  most  of  the  products. \nHowever,  within  the  villages  and  the  state  forestry/agriculture  farm  levels,  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  planning  and \ndecision-making  process  is  still  limited;  they  are  constrained  to  borrow  funds;  and  they  have  limited  access  to  skills-\nenhancing activities.  \nRaohe is the main county with a small group of ethnic minority.  Currently, there is no project component in the vicinity \nof Hezhe minority villages in Raohe. Koreans in the villages of Yongfeng and Dongsheng in Raohe might be affected \nby conversion of 300 ha of farmland to wetlands in the Dajiahe NR if the selected areas are confirmed. Loss of land \nand related income from paddy farming will affect 37 households. The adverse impacts on the two Korean villages can \nbe  compensated  under  the  resettlement  plans  and  mitigated  under  the  village  development  plans  to  develop \nalternative livelihoods schemes.  \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nStakeholder analysis: A stakeholder analysis was conducted during the project preparatory TA (technical assistance) \nand  roles  of  each  stakeholder  were  well-defined.  The  stakeholders  at  each  level  were  consulted  during  the  TA: \ngovernment ministries/agencies at the national to local levels, local governments from provincial down to village levels, \nstate-owned  and  local  forest/agriculture  farm  leaders,  workers,  women,  rural  community  leaders,  the  poor  farmer \nhouseholds, minorities, and nongovernment organizations. Their expectations and needs were identified, the potential \nproject impacts on them were identified, and the resettlement plans, gender development plans, minority development \nplans, and public participation plans were developed in consultation with the stakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nParticipation strategy: To strengthen the project design and enhance the sustainability of the Project, a community-\nbased approach to project planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation will be emphasized during all phases \nof implementation. To enhance the sense of ownership, three community-level project working groups will be set up: \nproject  planning  working  group,  project  implementation  group,  and  project  monitoring  group.  The  groups  will  play \ndifferent  roles  throughout  the  Project.  Each  group  will  include  community  leaders,  women,  and  the  poor.  The  social \nassessment and public participation plan is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender  Analysis:  Division  of  labor  by  gender  is  evident  in  the  project  area\u2014men  are  more  inclined  to  conduct \noutside activities, operate as migrant labor, and conduct heavy physical activities, while women are more responsible \nand  tend  to  carry  out  farming  and  household  chores.  Women  have  lower  education  levels  than  men  and  have  less \nrepresentation in community affairs. Other features of women are participation and involvements in economic activities \nhave been detailed above. \nGender  and  development  plan:  Project  will  not  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  women,  but  equal \nrepresentations  of  both  gender  in  development  planning  and  implementation  have  been  strengthened  in  the  project \ndesign, given the fact that local project staff have low gender sensitivities and lack the knowledge and skills for gender \nanalysis  and  incorporation.  The  gender  development  action  will  facilitate  and  encourage  women\u2019s  involvement \nthroughout  project  implementation,  ensure  tangible  benefits  for  both  female  and  male  community  members,  and \naddress the gender impact on the proposed activities in the project areas. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.
