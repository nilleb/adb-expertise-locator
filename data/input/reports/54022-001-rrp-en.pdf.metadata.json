The program \nis  aligned  with  the  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132022  in  supporting  the  integration  of \ndisaster  resilience  in  various  sectors  of  the  economy  and  increasing  preparedness  for  health-\nrelated emergencies by upgrading healthcare facilities and building human resource capacity in \nthe health system, particularly in light of the vulnerabilities exposed by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19)  pandemic. 1 The  program  is  also  aligned  with  the  second  strategic  pillar  of  the \nPhilippines  country  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132023,  which  promotes \nlocal  economic \ndevelopment.2 The program supports Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities  on  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities  (operational  priority  1); \naccelerating progress in gender equality (operational priority 2); tackling climate change,3 building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (operational priority \n3);  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  (operational  priority  6);  and  fostering \nregional cooperation and integration (operational priority 7).  \n \n\n  \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3.  \nDisaster  risk.  The  Philippines  is  widely  regarded  as  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  disaster-\nprone countries,4 with a high likelihood of its economy being severely impacted by disasters.5 It \nis  located  along  the  so-called  Pacific  Ring  of  Fire,  making  it  susceptible  to  earthquakes  and \nvolcanic eruptions.6 The country also experiences frequent tropical cyclones (typhoons), floods, \nlandslides, and droughts. Seventy-four percent of the population is vulnerable to multiple natural \nhazards.  The  average  annual  cost  of  disasters  is  estimated  at  0.7%\u20131.0%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP).7 Disaster risk modeling indicates that the country faces average annual losses of \n\u20b143.5 billion due to earthquakes and \u20b1133.2 billion due to tropical cyclones.8 Most notable was \nTyphoon Yolanda (Haiyan; 2013) with over 6,000 fatalities, 16 million affected people, and losses \nof  4.7%  of  2013  GDP. 9  More  recently,  Typhoon  Ompong  (Mangkhut;  2018),  the  Mindanao \nearthquakes (2019), Typhoon Tisoy (Kammuri; 2019), and the Taal volcano eruption (2020) have \ncollectively  affected  about  6  million  people  with  damages  estimated  at  approximately  \n\n \n\n1   National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\u20b144.13 billion.10 These events have worsened poverty, and the typhoon-prone provinces located \nalong the eastern seaboard are among those with the highest poverty rates in the country.11 \n \n4. \nRecognizing  these vulnerabilities,  the  government  enacted  the  Philippine  Disaster  Risk \nReduction and Management Act of 2010 (Republic Act No. 10121),12 which: (i) strengthened risk \nreduction and management by taking a whole-of-government approach; and (ii) institutionalized \nthe Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan and associated appropriation of funds. The \ngovernment adopted its Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) Strategy in 2015.  \n \n5. \nPublic health management and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Philippines has made \nsignificant improvements in the health status of its people, with life expectancy at birth improving \nfrom 63.7 years in 1980 to 71.1 years in 2018.13 About half of the provinces in the Philippines are \nmalaria-free, and the country has achieved the Millennium Development Goal for tuberculosis.14 \nPolio-free status was maintained for 3 decades before the disease returned in 2019 because of \nparents\u2019  aversion  to  having  their  children  vaccinated.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  presents  an \nunprecedented health challenge for the Philippines. The first case of COVID-19 was detected on \n30 January 2020, and by March 2020 the rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases reflected \nthe extent of community transmission. As of 13 August 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases was \n147,526  with  2,426  deaths  and  70,387  recovered. 15  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  put \nconsiderable stress on the health system, with exposed frontline health workers at particular risk \nof contracting the disease.  \n \n6.  \nGovernment  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  On  8  March  2020,  Presidential \nProclamation No. 922 was issued declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the \nPhilippines due to COVID-19,16 which intensified government reporting and enforced quarantine, \ndisease control, and prevention measures. This was followed by a temporary closure of schools \nin  Metro  Manila.  Further,  on  16  March  2020,  Presidential  Proclamation  No.  929  was  issued \ndeclaring  a  state  of  calamity  nationwide,  together  with  enhanced  community  quarantine  in \nLuzon.17 On 24 March 2020, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal \nas  One  Act,  which  enabled  measures  to    address  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  These  included:  \n(i) augmenting operational budgets, financial assistance programs, and food programs of national \ngovernment  agencies,  the  National  Disaster  Risk  and  Reduction  Management  Fund,  and  the \nQuick Response Funds of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Social Welfare \nand  Development;  and  (ii)  authorizing  local  government  units  (LGUs)  to  utilize  more  than  the \nmandated 5% allocated for their local disaster risk and reduction management funds, subject to \nfunding  from  the  national  government.  On  22  May  2020,  Inter-Agency  Task  Force  Resolution  \n\nfrom national government agencies. \n\n \n\n10 Estimates provided by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), citing sources \n\n11 These  include  some  of  the  most  vulnerable  rural  fishing  and  agricultural  provinces\u2014Albay,  Camarines  Sur, \nCatanduanes, and Sorsogon in the Bicol region (Region V)\u2014with a total population of 5.8 million, and the largely \nrural coastal provinces of Eastern and Western Samar and Leyte in the Eastern Visayas Region (Region VIII) with a \ntotal population of 4.0 million.  \n\n12 Republic Act No. 10121. http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/45/Republic_Act_10121.pdf \n13 World Bank.

On  23  April  2020,  ADB  approved  the  $1.5  billion  \nCOVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  (CARES)  Program  to  support  the \ngovernment response.20 In May 2020, 900,000 units of personal protective equipment (PPE) were \nprocured, 90-day forecasts for required PPE are regularly calculated, and local production of PPE \nhas been initiated. Polymerase chain reaction and GeneXpert21 testing capacity has increased \nwith a maximum of 36,567 daily tests performed by a total of 102 laboratories as of 11 August \n2020,  with  capacity  to  administer  up  to  90,694  tests  per  day.  The  national  health  insurance \nagency,  the  Philippine  Health  Insurance  Corporation,  has  expanded  insurance  coverage  to \ninclude polymerase chain reaction testing, isolation services, and treatment of COVID-19. Income \ntransfers  have  helped  to  provide  basic  livelihood  support  to  families  engaged  in  the  informal \nsector. As of 12 August 2020, 24.5 million families had received emergency cash subsidies of \n\u20b1142.2  billion.22 Under  the  government\u2019s  small  business  wage  Enhanced  Community  subsidy \nscheme,  3.1  million  formal  workers  in  small  businesses  unable  to  work  during  the  Quarantine \nperiod received wage subsidies totaling \u20b146 billion.23   \n \n8. \nPrior to the pandemic, the economy grew by 6.3% per year on average during 2010\u20132019, \ndriven  by  robust  domestic  investment  and  strong  performance  in  agriculture  and construction.  \nThe  economy  was  initially  forecast  to  grow  by  6.2%  in  2020;  however,  with  the  COVID-19 \noutbreak, it is now forecast to contract by 3.8%.24  The real sector has been severely impacted \nas most businesses are unable to operate, together with significant disruptions to global supply \nchains and the sharp decline in tourist arrivals. Livelihoods have been adversely affected. The \nApril 2020 labor force survey showed the unemployment rate at 17.7%. The pandemic will reverse \nthe gains in poverty reduction. An additional 5.5 million Filipinos are expected to fall into poverty, \nwith poverty incidence estimated to rise to 20.7% in 2020 (footnote 20). In its COVID-19 recovery \nplanning, the government also needs to address the long-standing problem of income inequality. \nThe  degree of  income  inequality  in the  Philippines  exceeds that  of  its  regional  peers,  with the \nnational average masking significant regional disparities within the country.25  \n \nDevelopment  constraints.  The  Philippines  faces  four  development  constraints.  First, \n9. \ndisaster  resilience  policy  making  and  coordination  at  the  national  level  are  fragmented  across \nmultiple  agencies,  and  there  is  insufficient  support  to  build  resilience  in  the  most  vulnerable \nprovinces  and  urban  areas.  Second,  there  is  inadequate  integration  of  disaster  risk  reduction \n(DRR) and climate change adaptation in local government planning and infrastructure investment \nplanning, which ultimately delays the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Third, \nthere are no clear and cohesive policy frameworks or protocols in the health and social assistance \nsystems to prepare for and proactively respond to epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, \nalthough  the  government  reacts  with  speed  within  its  constraints.  These  undermine  levels  of \npreparedness, result in delays in early recovery and rehabilitation, and exacerbate the economic \nand social impacts of physical losses following a disaster. They also place a strain on the health \n\nNO-38.pdf \n\n \n\n18 IATF Resolution No. 38. https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2020/05may/20200522-IATF-RESOLUTION-\n\n19 Philippine News Agency. https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1105226  \n20 ADB. 2020.

Asian Development Outlook Supplement 2020. Manila. \n25 The Philippines\u2019 Gini coefficient is 0.44, compared with 0.38 in Thailand, 0.39 in Indonesia, and 0.34 in Viet Nam. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fand social  assistance  systems,  as allocated  resources  are inadequate for  healthcare  facilities, \ntesting, and social services. Fourth, disaster risk financing capacity is insufficient, as evidenced \nby  the  limited  use  of  traditional  and  innovative  risk  retention  and  risk  transfer  instruments.  \nPost-disaster  financing  constraints  restrict  the  opportunities  to  build  back  better  and  enhance \nresilience to future hazard events. \n \n10. \nADB  engagement  and  lessons  learned.  ADB  has  extended  significant  post-disaster \nsupport  to  the  Philippines  dating  back  as  far  as  Typhoon  Sisang  (Nina;  1987),26  with  a  total \npresent  value  of  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  public  assets  at  $1.78  billion.27 \nHowever,  support  had  been  primarily  reactive (ex  post)  and  ADB  began  to  explore  viable  risk \ntransfer  solutions  for  financing  reconstruction,  to  enable  the  government  to  access  rapid  \npost-disaster liquidity and spread the costs of recovery and reconstruction over time.28 The speed \nof the response of the contingent financing instruments provided by the World Bank and Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) to the Philippines after Typhoons Yolanda and Ompong \nalso demonstrated the importance of an instrument such as the CDF for disaster preparedness \nand response.29 The proposed CDF will form an integral part of the Philippines\u2019 broader disaster \nrisk  financing framework  under  its  DRFI  Strategy,  support rapid provision  of  liquidity  for timely \ndisaster  and  health  emergency  response,  and  help  the  government  to  manage  the  fiscal  risk \narising from disasters triggered by natural hazards and pandemics.30 \n \n As a policy-based instrument, the proposed program provides an opportunity for ADB to \n11. \nengage in policy dialogue with the government and also build on ongoing reform programs. ADB \nis currently engaged with the government to strengthen local governance in the Philippines,31 and \nis expanding support to the employment program of the Department of Labor and Employment \n(DOLE) to include child labor prevention programs, including addressing increased vulnerability \nto child labor resulting from the economic impact of disasters and pandemics on poor families. \nThrough  its  reforms,  the  proposed  program  can  also  address  disaster  risk  management  and \nhealth policy bottlenecks in investment projects in these areas.32  \n \n12.   Development partner coordination on disaster risk management. The Department of \nFinance (DOF) leads development partner coordination through its DRFI Strategy, as it seeks to \nrefine its approach and achieve an adequate and cost-effective portfolio of disaster risk financing \ninstruments. With development partner support, the government has taken further measures to \nimprove its financial preparedness for disasters, utilizing contingent credit facilities and innovative \ninsurance  and  insurance-linked  securities.  The  World  Bank  and  JICA  have  been  active  in this \n\n \n\n26 ADB assistance includes $500.0 million emergency assistance loan for Typhoon Yolanda (ADB. 2013.

A  dedicated  city-level  disaster  insurance  project  may  follow  the  Disaster  Resilience \nImprovement Program reform which supports a GSIS pilot of the city-level insurance scheme. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\farea. The World Bank provided a $500 million development policy loan facility with a catastrophe \ndeferred drawdown option (Cat DDO) in 2011 and another $500 million Cat DDO in 2015, $496.25 \nmillion of which was released in October 2018 in response to Typhoon Ompong. The second Cat \nDDO  closed  in  March  2020  (footnote  29).  In  2014,  JICA  provided  a  \u00a550  billion  Post-Disaster \nStand-by  Loan  (footnote  29).The  government  launched  a  pilot  in  August  2017,  with  technical \nsupport  from  the  World  Bank,  to  provide  $206  million  in  modeled  loss  parametric  insurance \ncoverage through the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) against losses from tropical \ncyclones  and  earthquakes  to  national  government  assets  and  25  provinces  located  along  the \neastern  seaboard.  Premiums  were  funded  through a \u20b11 billion  ($19.8 million)  allocation  in the \n2017 General Appropriations Act, under the National Disaster Risk and Reduction Management \nFund.33 In  November  2019,  the  World  Bank  issued  two  tranches  of  3-year  catastrophe-linked \nbonds to provide the Philippines with financial protection of up to $75 million against losses from \nearthquakes and $150 million against losses from tropical cyclones.34 On 15 April 2020, the World \nBank approved its $500 million Third Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan.35 \n \n13.   Development partner coordination in response to COVID-19. Since the onset of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, ADB has coordinated with the United Nations agencies \nand  other  development  partners.  Following \nthe  World  Health  Organization\u2019s  Strategic \nPreparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, the Philippines has adopted a whole-of-society \ncoordination  mechanism,  comprising  the  DOH,  the  World  Health  Organization,  the  National \nDisaster  Risk  Reduction  and  Management  Council  (NDRRMC),  government  stakeholders,  the \nprivate  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations  such  as  the  Philippine  Red  Cross.  The \ngovernment  has  also  committed  to  working  collectively  with  its  neighbors  in  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN).36 \n \nB. \n \n14. \nProposed  program.  To  complement  ADB\u2019s  previous  and  ongoing  support  to  the \nPhilippines, including the CARES Program,37 the policy actions under the proposed program will \nstrengthen  disaster  resilience  of  Philippine  institutions  and  communities  and  the  government\u2019s \nresponse  to  pandemics  through  three  reform  areas:  policy  and  institutional  arrangements  for \ndisaster risk management and health-related emergencies, including social protection; resilience \nof national government assets and LGUs to disaster and climate risks; and disaster risk financing. \nThe outcome of the program is that the disaster resilience and pandemic response of institutions \nand communities will be strengthened, and financial preparedness for disasters improved.  The \nCARES Program supported the government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program, which included the \nprovision  of  laboratories  and  health  facilities,  and  expanded  the  essential  unconditional  cash \ntransfer support to 18 million families. The Disaster Resilience Improvement Program supports \nmedium-term pandemic response reforms beyond the government\u2019s immediate COVID-19 needs \nsupported by the CARES Program. The proposed program responds directly to the COVID-19 \npandemic with support for urgent response measures required by the government to prepare for \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \n\n33 This program was renewed with a \u20b12 billion allocation in 2018 and discontinued at the end of 2019. \n34  World  Bank.  https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/11/25/world-bank-catastrophe-bond-transact-\n\nion-insures-the-republic-of-philippines-against-natural-disaster-related-losses-up-to-usd225-million. \n35 World Bank. 2020.

Under  this  reform  area,  a  consolidated  bill  to  establish  the \nDepartment of Disaster Resilience was submitted to Congress. The new department will merge \nthe functions of the NDRRMC and Office of Civil Defense to develop policies and implement DRR \nand management programs. Creating one department will help to integrate efforts that address \nthe concerns and needs of segments of the population with special needs or vulnerabilities such \nas women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and indigenous peoples with respect to \ndisaster  resilience  and  disaster  management.  It  will  also  result  in  a  speedier  response  by  the \ngovernment by considerably reducing coordination difficulties and bureaucratic inefficiencies.  \n \n16. \nBecause  disasters  disproportionately  affect  women  and  children,  their  occurrence  \ncorrelates  with  increases  in  child  labor.39  To  address  this,  DOLE  implemented  its  Child  Labor \nPrevention and Elimination Program (CLPEP). CLPEP profiled 275,614 children at risk of child \nlabor in 2018 and 2019, and provided (i) referral services for mothers and child laborers to support \nservices  (such  as  education,  employment,  and  medical  assistance)  and  (ii)  monitoring  and \nremoval from child labor. The DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program40 administers the livelihood \nassistance grants for CLPEP. Between 2019 and March 2020, the DOLE Integrated Livelihood \nAssistance  Program  provided  \u20b1712.4  million  of  livelihood  grants,  a  portion  of  which  benefited \n32,475 women. The DOLE has submitted a budget of \u20b11.5 billion to the Department of Budget \nand  Management  for  inclusion  in  the  2021  national  budget,  of  which  \u20b1145.5  million  will  be \nallocated  for  livelihood  assistance  to  parents  of  child  laborers.    Providing  essential  livelihood \nsupport to poor families reduces their vulnerability to child labor resulting from the socioeconomic \nimpact of disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n17. \nThe government has also developed an innovative and timely Risk Resiliency Program to \nestablish climate-  and  disaster-resilient communities within  17  provinces and  four major  urban \ncenters, all of which are highly vulnerable to drought, flooding, landslides, and storm surge.41 This \nprogram  supports  vulnerable agriculture  and fishing  communities,  ensures  resilience of  critical \ninfrastructure, and enhances knowledge and access to information through capacity building of \nnational and local government agencies. To increase women\u2019s adaptive and coping capacities, \nthe  Risk  Resiliency  Program  allocated  \u20b137.5 million  for  2020\u20132022  to  create  opportunities for \nwomen\u2019s  enterprises  and  empowerment  in  priority  landscapes  and  provinces.  Institutionalizing \nnational and local government climate change and disaster risk policies will prioritize and expand \ninvestment in climate and disaster resilience, in line with the national DRFI Strategy. \n \n18.   Policy and institutional arrangements for health-related emergencies. In the absence \nof a globally and commercially available COVID-19 vaccine in the short term, a comprehensive \nand  systematic  approach  to  testing,  as  well  as  improvement  in  the  country\u2019s  testing  capacity, \n\n \n\n38 ADB. 2020.

COVID-19 impact on child labour and forced labour: The response of the \n\nIPEC+ Flagship Programme. Geneva \n\n40  The  DOLE  Integrated  Livelihood  Program  or  Kabuhayan  seeks  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  to  risks  of  the  poor, \nvulnerable, and marginalized workers  by  providing  them  with  access  to  grant  assistance for  capacity  building  on \nlivelihood  ventures,  either  for  individual  or  group  undertakings.  Eligible  beneficiaries  include  marginalized  fishing \ncommunities, women and youth, parents of child laborers, and elderly workers. \n\n41 The 17 provinces are Masbate, Sorsogon, Negros Oriental, Samar, Sarangani, Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte, \nDinagat Islands, Eastern Samar, Southern Leyte, Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Bukidnon, Maguindanao, \nNorth Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and Sulu. The four major urban centers are Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, Metro Iloilo, \nand Metro Davao. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fbecome  critical  factors  in  getting  the  economy  back  to  normal.  First,  in  March  2020,  the \ngovernment  adopted  the  Philippine  National  Contingency  Plan  for  COVID-19  that  provides a \nframework to strengthen its capacity for detection, equip and train national rapid response teams, \nand strengthen infection prevention and control among healthcare workers. This includes training \nLGU healthcare workers on case investigation and contact tracing procedures to ensure effective \ncase  management  and  continuity  of  essential  health  services.  Second,  in  April  2020,  the \ngovernment  adopted  a  testing  capacity  policy  to  complement  the  establishment  of  a  new \nmolecular  diagnostics  laboratory  (footnote  46).  This  will    allow  the  government  to  establish \nguidelines for testing targets, including: (i) prioritizing the testing of frontline healthcare workers, \nof which 75% are women; (ii) allowing all subnational laboratories to allocate up to 30% of their \ndaily testing capacity to healthcare workers; and (iii) testing procedures for complete lockdown \nscenarios. Third, in June 2020, the government prepared a draft of the Philippine Health Facility \nDevelopment Plan, 2020\u20132040 to strengthen hospital resilience and inclusiveness and to better \nmanage  pandemics through  healthcare  facilities.  Upgrading  of  government  hospitals  is  under \nway,  with  a focus  on  capacities  that  will  strengthen  COVID-19  and  other  pandemic  resilience. \nFinally,  the  Philippine  Commission  on  Women  issued  guidelines  that  require  government \nagencies to address COVID-19-related gender issues in their annual gender and development \nplans and budgets, collect disaggregated data on personnel and beneficiaries, prevent gender-\nbased violence and discrimination against women, and regularly inform men and women about \nawareness programs to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n \n19. \nReform  area  2:  Resilience  of  national  government  assets  and  local  government \nunits to disaster and climate risks. Under this reform area, the government has mainstreamed \nclimate change adaptation and DRR in the comprehensive development plans of LGUs (provinces, \ncities,  and  municipalities).  In  addition,  the  government  enhanced  existing  LGU  assessment \nsystems by: (i) developing the Local Resilience Readiness Monitoring Framework, the disaster \naudit  component  of  the  Local  Governance  Performance  Management  System\u2013Seal  of  Good \nLocal Governance (LGPMS-SGLG); and (ii) strengthening the assessment criteria in the LGPMS-\nSGLG  through  social  protection  mechanisms  for  gender  and  development  plans  to  address \nviolence  against  women  and  to  introduce  maternal  care  insurance  packages.42  The  LGPMS-\nSGLG  enables  LGUs  to  access  the  Performance  Challenge  Fund  to  finance  their  local \ndevelopment  initiatives  and  other  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG) \nprograms. The Local Resilience Readiness Monitoring Framework serves as an assessment tool \nfor  evaluating  LGUs  and  broadens the  scope  of disaster  preparedness  expected  for  long-term \nrisk,  imminent  threats,  and  disaster  recovery.  It  also  serves  as  a  way  for  LGUs  to  track  their \nprogress and for the DILG and development partners to provide more focused interventions to \nidentify gaps and build local DRR capacity.  \n \n20. \nReform area 3: Disaster risk financing. Under this reform area, the GSIS approved the \nestablishment of a voluntary city-level parametric disaster insurance scheme on a pilot basis for \nearthquake  and  typhoon  cover,  with  the  possibility  of  an  additional  flood  risk  model.  The  pilot \nscheme will help inform the city-level insurance scheme before it is mainstreamed, as the GSIS \nintends to  learn from  such an  experiment  on  a  smaller scale.  The  pilot  will  target the  17  cities \nengaged  under  the  ADB-led  proposed  Philippine  City  Disaster  Insurance  Pool  project,  across \nMetro Manila, Mindanao, Visayas, and Luzon.43 This pilot insurance scheme will be the first of its \nkind  in  Southeast  Asia  and  will  help  inform  similar  ADB-designed  projects  in  the  future.  The \nparametric disaster insurance scheme provides participating cities with timely financial resources \n\n \n\n42 Assessment criteria for provinces and cities include a gender and development (GAD) focal point system, an updated \nGAD code, a GAD database, GAD accomplishment reports, plans, and budget; and for cities, 100% of barangays \nwith Violence Against Women and Children desks and reports. \n\n43 ADB. 2018. Concept Paper: Philippines: City Disaster Insurance Pool Project. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffor  early  economic  recovery.  It  bolsters  their  fiscal  resilience,  and  provides  predictable  payout \nexpectations  and  a  solution  to  narrow  the  funding  gap  between  available  resources  and  post-\ndisaster  response  costs for  severe  events.  Finally,  in light  of the  January  2020  eruption  of  the \nTaal volcano, the GSIS extended its indemnity disaster insurance coverage to include storm surge \nand  volcanic  eruptions.  GSIS  engages  in  institutional  dialogue  through  its  members  forum  to \naddress arising gender issues as part of its client-focused gender and development mandate.  \n \n21.   Post-program  partnership  framework.  To  ensure  the  continuity  of  reforms  through \nstructured  policy  dialogue,  the  program  incorporates  a  post-program  partnership  framework \n(PPPF). The framework will support climate tagging of expenditures and DRR tagging of national \nagency  and  LGU  budgets,  including  expenditures  that  relate  to  gender  and  women\u2019s \nconsiderations in the implementation of programs and policies. It will support the update of: (i) the \nNational  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and  Management  Plan,  2011\u20132028;  (ii)  the  Climate  Change \nAdaptation, Mitigation, and Disaster Risk Reduction Road Map to reflect revisions to the National \nDisaster  Risk  Reduction  and  Management  Plan;  and  (iii)  the  National  Climate  Change  Action \nPlan,  including  efforts  to  improve  the  resilience  of  healthcare  systems  to  address  disease \noutbreaks. In  addition, the  PPPF will  help implement  the  government\u2019s  testing capacity  policy, \nincluding  data  sharing  with  its  neighbors  in  ASEAN.  A  comprehensive  gender-responsive  and \nsocially  inclusive  training  module  and  a  training-of-trainers  program  will  be  rolled  out  to  state \nuniversities  and  colleges.  The  government  will  develop  an  enhanced  project  development  and \nevaluation manual of the National Economic and Development Authority to incorporate climate \nand disaster risk parameters in project preparation and appraisal. Finally, the program will support \nthe implementation of a city-level parametric disaster insurance scheme covering earthquake and \ntyphoons,  with  a  target  to  recruit  up  to  20  cities  per  year  during  2021\u20132023,  and  to  build  the \ncapacities  of  LGU  beneficiaries  to  address  gender  and  social  inclusion  issues  in  the  use  of \ninsurance proceeds. ADB will secure funding for the technical assistance that will support priority \nactivities during 2020\u20132023. \n \n22.   ADB\u2019s value addition in disaster risk management. The proposed program fulfills the \ndual objectives of supporting fundamental DRR reforms and providing quick-disbursing financing \nfor  disaster  preparedness  and  response  (recovery  and  reconstruction).  Working  closely  with \ndevelopment  partners,  ADB  has  provided  substantial  inputs  to  several  damage,  loss,  and  \npost-disaster  needs  assessments  of  natural  hazards,  which  formed  the  basis  for  all  ADB \nassistance. A $1 million technical assistance grant supported the assessment of DRF needs of \n17 cities across four regions in the country, DRF capacity building of local DRR and management \noffices,  and  a  parametric  insurance  pool  design.44  ADB  provided  legal  support,  financial \nstructuring,  actuarial  and  economic  modeling,  and  the  development  of  an  asset  exposure \ndatabase for a city-level parametric disaster insurance scheme. ADB has also supported several  \nknowledge-sharing  initiatives  through  national  workshops,  and  the  ASEAN  and  Asia-Pacific \nEconomic  Cooperation  conferences  participated  in  by  Philippine  representatives  from  cities \nselected to pilot the parametric disaster insurance scheme and national government agencies. \nADB\u2019s support for the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (Kalahi-CIDSS) \nprogram  has  been  instrumental  in  building  capacity  of  local  communities  in  the  aftermath  of \ndisasters (footnote 26). \n \n23.   ADB\u2019s value addition in COVID-19 response. ADB has mobilized significant advisory \nand  financial  support  for  the  government\u2019s  pandemic  response.  In  addition  to  the  $1.5  billion \nCARES Program loan (footnote 20), ADB approved: (i) $200 million of additional financing to the \nSocial Protection Support Project to support emergency cash assistance to poor and vulnerable \n\n44 ADB. 2018. Philippine City Disaster Insurance Pool Rationale and Design. Manila. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fImpacts of the Reform \n\nhouseholds;45 (ii) a $3 million Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant to procure and establish \na  modern  laboratory  at  the  J.B.  Lingad  Memorial  Regional  Hospital  in  San  Fernando  City, \nPampanga;46  (iii)  the  $5  million  Bayan  Bayanihan emergency  grant  for  food  distribution;47 and  \n(iv) policy advisory support on the design of wage subsidies, setting up a social unemployment \ninsurance scheme, and tax and financial relief for small- and medium-sized enterprises. ADB is \ncarrying  out  a  survey  of  business  establishments  to  collect  quantitative  data  on  output, \nemployment, and revenues. This will support a better understanding of the pandemic\u2019s impact on \nthe economy and enable ADB to help the government design an effective recovery strategy. ADB \nwill provide a bespoke coordination and monitoring framework to support effective implementation \nof the CARES Program and establish synergies with ADB CARES programs for other developing \nmember countries. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe impact of the program is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 \n(footnote 1) with regard to reduced vulnerability to climate change and disaster risk, strengthened \nintegration  of  disaster  resilience  in  various  sectors  of  the  economy,  and  improved  access  to \nhealthcare. The impact of the program is demonstrated through the performance indicators in the \ndesign and monitoring framework.48 The program impact assessment concludes that the reform \nachieved under the program is expected to mitigate $692.4 million\u2013$1,275.7 million of damage \nand losses from natural hazards at present value, accrued during 2020\ua7f72025.49 Meanwhile, the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is estimated to cause economic losses of about $25.6 billion or 7.7% of GDP \nin 2020. The benefits result from the government\u2019s rapid access to resources that would enable \nthe government to initiate a timely response, thereby mitigating the indirect economic and social \nimpact of disasters and pandemics. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement.  The  government  has  chosen  option  1  of  the  CDF  policy  where,  upon  loan \neffectiveness, the committed CDF amount will be available for disbursement immediately after a \ndisaster occurs.50 The government will pay a one-time front-end fee of 0.25% of the committed \nloan amount, which may be financed out of the loan proceeds. If the undisbursed loan amount is \nrenewed for an additional 3-year loan availability period (up to four times), the borrower will pay \na fee of 0.25% of the renewal amount (up to the undisbursed loan balance) each time, which may \nalso be financed out of the loan proceeds. The loan size is based on the Philippines\u2019 development \nfinancing needs. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, overall financing needs will reach record \nlevels, with the government requiring $58 billion for 2020.  \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n45  ADB.

The DOF will be the program\u2019s executing agency and will \noversee and coordinate the timely implementation of the  program. The implementing agencies \nare  the  National  Economic and Development  Authority,  DILG,  the  Department  of  Environment \nand Natural Resources, DOLE, the Office of Civil Defense (which serves as the implementing arm \nof  the  NDRRMC),  the  Climate  Change  Commission,  GSIS,  the  Philippine  Commission  on \nWomen, and the DOH. The program will be completed in 2023. Renewal of the program is subject \nto reconfirmation of the adequacy of the macroeconomic environment, the Philippines\u2019 continued \nprogress  toward  the  PPPF,  and  an  updated  PPPF  with  mutually  agreed  objectives  for  the \nsubsequent  availability  period.  The  renewal  may  also  be  affected  by  changes  in  country \nclassification during the program period. \n \n27.   Disbursement  triggers  and  approach.  Disbursement  triggers  will  not  be  applied \nretroactively. For natural hazards, withdrawal requests will be deferred until the President of the \nPhilippines  has  declared  a  state  of  calamity  in  accordance  with  Republic  Act  No.  10121  (first \nparagraph,  Section  16)  or  taken  equivalent  measures.  For  health-related  emergencies, \nwithdrawal requests will be deferred until one of the following three conditions is satisfied: (i) the \nborrower has enacted a law in response to a public health emergency; (ii) the President of the \nPhilippines has declared a state of public health emergency in accordance with Republic Act No. \n11332, Section 7; or (iii) the President of the Philippines has issued a proclamation or an executive \norder  (or  other  equivalent  Presidential  instruments)  declaring  or  describing  a  worsening  health \nsituation,51  or  imposing  an  enhanced  community  quarantine  or  its  functional  equivalent.  The \nPresident of the Philippines may authorize the Inter Agency Task Force for the Management of \nEmerging  Infectious  Diseases  to  impose  an  enhanced  community  quarantine  or  its  functional \nequivalent,  and  under  such  a  circumstance,  a  resolution  by  the  Task  Force  will  be  deemed \nequivalent  to  imposition  by  the  President  himself/herself.  The  terms  \u201cimposing\u201d,  \u201cimpose\u201d,  or \n\u201cimposition\u201d in this paragraph shall refer to (i) a new imposition, (ii) a reinstatement after a period \nof a break, or (iii) an extension of an enhanced community quarantine, which is imposed after the \ndate  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  government  may  withdraw  the  loan  proceeds  partially  or \nentirely, depending on its assessment of the severity of the disaster or health-related emergency \nand resulting need. Only a single withdrawal may be requested per disaster or health emergency \nevent, and the request must be received by ADB within 90 days of the declaration of a state of \ncalamity or emergency. Any unutilized funds at the conclusion of the loan availability period may \nbe  disbursed  to  the  Philippines  under  the  deferred  disbursement  option,  subject  to  ADB \nreconfirming the Philippines\u2019 continuation of policy actions and the PPPF through submission of \na  progress  report.  Funds  will  be  spent  through  national  budget  processes  for  eligible  items. \nProceeds of the CDF will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will periodically monitor the continuing implementation \nof the policy targets and the PPPF during the availability period. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n28.   Safeguards.

The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts \nwithin the meaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n29. \nGender.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Women  are \ndisproportionately affected by climate change and disasters because of gendered vulnerabilities. \n\n51 The list of proclamations and executive orders can be found in the Official Gazette.  \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fAs  such,  women  and  children  are  14  times  more  likely  to  succumb  to  disasters  compared  to \nmen.52 Key issues Filipino women face during disasters are: (i) increased vulnerability to gender-\nbased violence (footnote 52) (in normal times, one in four women aged 15\u201349 has experienced \nphysical, sexual or emotional violence committed by their husband or partner);53 (ii) compromised \nsexual  and  reproductive  health  services,  and  psychosocial  counseling;  (iii)  a  lack  of  gender-\nresponsive facilities and products; (iv) increased unpaid care and community work; and (v) limited \nmobility and skills typically taught to men, such as swimming and climbing, thereby hindering their \nself-rescue and self-defense capabilities. With this, children of vulnerable women are more likely \nto  drop  out  of  school  and  become  child  laborers  to  help  the  family  to  survive  through  an \nemergency. The program addresses these issues through legislation, creating the Department of \nDisaster  Resilience,  which,  among  others,  addresses  the  needs  of  segments  with  increased \nvulnerabilities,  such  as  women,  children,  the  elderly,  persons  with  disabilities,  and  indigenous \npeoples.  \n \n30. \nThe  program  also  provides  guidance  for  all  national  government  agencies  to  integrate \nmeasures to address COVID-19-related gender issues in their annual gender and development \nplans and budgets, and to allocate budgets to create opportunities for women\u2019s enterprises and \nempowerment as part of the government\u2019s Risk Resiliency Program. This includes dialogue to \naddress gender issues in government-issued indemnity insurance policies, prioritizing testing of \nfrontline healthcare workers (of which 75% are women), and directing all subnational laboratories \nto  allocate  20%\u201330%  of  their  daily  testing  capacity  to  healthcare  workers  and  training  LGU \nhealthcare workers in case management and contact tracing procedures. DOLE is implementing \nits Child Labor Prevention and Elimination Program, providing livelihood assistance to mothers \nand families of child laborers who are particularly vulnerable during disasters and pandemics. The \ngovernment  is  also  enhancing  performance  indicators  for  LGUs,  which  include  gender  and \ndevelopment mechanisms to encompass LGUs\u2019 existing hazard profiles and disaster risks. \n \n31.   Governance.  While  the  2016  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  report  is \nbeing  updated,  the  government  has  set  an  aggressive  reform  agenda  to  promote  better \ngovernance. The framework of the Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap, 2017\u20132022 \naims to strengthen the foundation of the public financial management system.54 Key reforms aim \nto  improve  costing,  cash  management,  planning  and  budgeting,  and  procurement.  The \ngovernment's performance relative to international fiscal transparency standards and indicators \nof  corruption  has  improved.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, including the DOF.  \n \n32.   Poverty and social. The program supports sound policy frameworks at the national and \nlocal  government  level,  based  on  pro-poor  and  gender-sensitive  development  strategies,  to \nsupport  poverty  eradication.  The  government\u2019s  policies  ensure  mobilization  of  resources  from \nvarious sources to provide adequate and predictable financing for disaster insurance for the poor \nand  vulnerable.  The  policies  also  build  resilience  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  by  reducing  their \nexposure and vulnerability to extreme weather and geophysical events; epidemics; pandemics; \nand other economic, social, and environmental shocks. These policies, combined with the delivery \n\n \n\n52  United  Nations  Office  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction.  2016.

To improve fiscal resilience of local governments and narrow the \nfunding gap between available resources and post-disaster \nresponse costs for severe events, the GSIS will (i) implement a \ncity-level parametric disaster insurance scheme covering \nearthquake and typhoons, with a view to recruit up to 20 cities per \nyear between 2021 and 2023, and (ii) build the capacities of LGU \nbeneficiaries to address gender and social inclusion issues in the \nuse of insurance proceeds.
