THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the COVID-19 Rapid Response Program under the Countercyclical Support Facility \nCOVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1  \n \n2.  COVID-19 is triggering a severe economic slowdown in Mongolia. The country\u2019s limited \neconomic diversification and dependence on mining expose it to external shocks, particularly to \nswings in commodity prices. The current turmoil in the global economy and commodity markets \nhas reduced revenues, increased balance of payment pressures, and accentuated financial \nsector risks. The most vulnerable groups in Mongolia are impacted most, as social transfers \naccount for about 40% of the poor\u2019s income. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecasts gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth in 2020 at 2.1%, down from an earlier estimate of 6.1%.2  \n \n3.  The  spread  of  COVID-19  also  poses  a  serious  public  health  threat  to the  country. \nMongolia\u2019s proactive response to the outbreak3\u2014strict border closures, a suspension of  air \npassenger travel, enforced quarantine for arriving passengers, and restrictions on daily life\u2014has \nkept the number of COVID-19 cases low, but vulnerabilities remain.4 The government has \nidentified 20% of the population at high risk in the context of a strained health system already \nsuffering from a shortage of beds, essential medical equipment, and health care professionals.  \n \n4.  The proposed program will help the Government of Mongolia mitigate the severe negative \nhealth and economic impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will support \nthe government\u2019s ongoing initiatives, including (i) a National Emergency Response Plan to contain \nthe spread of COVID-19 and strengthen the health system; and (ii) a countercyclical development \nexpenditure program5 (CDEP), which contains cash transfer schemes and other social protection \nmeasures  targeting  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  households,  and  businesses. 6 Table  1 \nsummarizes Mongolia\u2019s compliance with the access criteria of the CPRO.7 \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \n \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1.  Adverse impact of  ADB forecasts growth will fall to between \u20130.4% and 2.1% in 2020 from \nexogenous shocks   5.1% in 2019. Employment loss is estimated at 16%\u201320% of total \nemployed. Financing needs have largely increased as revenues will fall \nby 9.2%, expenditures will increase by 11.7%. The fiscal balance will \ndeteriorate from 1.4% of GDP in 2019 to -2.7% of GDP in 2020.  \n2.  Countercyclical  The government announced plans to spend $1.8 billion under a targeted \ndevelopment expenditure  CDEP to support public health ($71.8 million), social protection ($474 \nmillion), and economic measures to mitigate the adverse impact of the \npandemic  ($1.3  billion).  The  CDEP  targets  the  most  vulnerable \nindividuals and companies. \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2020.

Pre-shock record of  Annual average growth was 5.9% during 2017\u20132019. Macroeconomic \ngenerally sound  management  pre-COVID-19  was  generally  sound.  Mongolia  has \nmacroeconomic management  reduced debt by 30 percentage points since end 2016 and ran fiscal \nsurpluses in both 2018 and 2019.8 Inflation has been below target (8%) \nsince 2017. Despite weaknesses in the banking sector, macroeconomic \nindicators were robust in 2019. Exports hit a historic high of $7.6 billion \nin 2019, and FDI remained stable at $2.1 billion.  The balance of \npayments recorded a surplus of $0.5 billion, bringing gross foreign \nexchange reserves up to $4.4 billion (5.8 months of imports) in 2019. \n4.  Structural reforms  The National Emergency Response Plan includes quarantine protocols, \ntravel restrictions, school closures, border closures, and imports of \nessential  equipment.  The  government  is  also  planning  several \nmeasures to strengthen the health sector\u2019s response over the medium-\nterm.  These  include  strengthening  national  standards  for  infection \nprevention and control, improving national standards to manage severe \nacute respiratory infections patients, and increasing the speed at which \nsuspected cases are confirmed.  \n5.  Debt sustainability  ADB\u2019s baseline scenario shows that the public debt\u2013GDP ratio will rise \nby 7.3 percentage points to 86.4% in 2020 (slightly above the 2019 \nlevel). Debt-to-GDP is expected to resume its pre-COVID-19 downward \ntrajectory in 2021. This scenario is consistent with the IMF\u2019s views.  \n6.  Coordination with  To support macroeconomic reforms in Mongolia, the IMF established \nInternational Monetary Fund   an EFF in May 2017, which will close in May 2020. The EFF also \nprovides  a platform for coordination and dialogue among international \nfinancial institutions and major development partners. ADB is in close \ndialogue with the IMF on macroeconomic monitoring, particularly on the \nimpact  of  COVID-19  on  the  economy,  fiscal  responses,  and  debt \nsustainability. The IMF has provided an assessment letter.   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CDEP = countercyclical development expenditure program, CPRO = COVID-19 \nPandemic Response Option, EFF = Extended Fund Facility, FDI = foreign direct investment, GDP = gross domestic \nproduct, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints  \n \n5.  Mongolia\u2019s narrow economic base makes it vulnerable to external shocks across \nmultiple sectors. Mining alone accounts for 24% of GDP and almost 90% of exports, with two \ncommodities\u2014copper and coal\u2014representing more than 60% of exports.9 Mongolia is heavily \ndependent on trade with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), which receives 89.1% of \nMongolia\u2019s exports. The deceleration of the PRC\u2019s economy has triggered a sharp fall in export \nprices in Mongolia (Figure 1), the ramifications of which have depressed economic activity in the \ntransport,  tourism, retail  trade,  and  services sectors.  Mobility  restrictions  and  supply chain \ndisruptions have severely impacted trade. When compared with 2019, March 2020 merchandise \nexports contracted by 41.5%, resulting in a loss of about $700 million in export revenues (Figure \n2) and dragging on the current account and balance of payments in the first quarter of 2020 \n \n8  The debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from 109.1% in 2016 to 79.1% in 2019. \n9  Copper makes up 24% of exports, and coal makes up 40% of exports, according to ADB estimates that are based \non statistical data from the Customs General Administration of Mongolia (2020). \n ", "3 \n(Figure 3). Budget revenues for 2020 are expected to be 9.2% lower than in the originally \napproved budget.10 \n  \nFigure 1: Export Price Index,  Figure 2: Export Value, \nYear-Over-Year   Year-Over-Year  \n(%) (%) \n \n40% 100%\n30%\n20% 50%\n10%\n0%\n0%\nTotal exports\n-10%\n-50%\nCoal\n-20%\nCopper concentrate\n-30% -24.1% -100%\n81-naJ 81-raM 81-yaM 81-luJ 81-peS 81-voN 91-naJ 91-raM 91-yaM 91-luJ 91-peS 91-voN 02-naJ 02-raM 81-naJ 81-raM 81-yaM 81-luJ 81-peS 81-voN 91-naJ 91-raM 91-yaM 91-luJ 91-peS 91-voN 02-naJ 02-raM\n   \nSources: Customs General Administration of Mongolia,  Sources: Customs General Administration of Mongolia, \nBank of Mongolia statistics, and 2020 Asian  Bank of Mongolia statistics, and 2020 Asian \nDevelopment Bank estimates.

Despite Mongolia\u2019s early response to the outbreak, poor and \nvulnerable groups are especially at risk. The peri-urban ger (traditional tent) settlements in \nUlaanbaatar are highly exposed, with cramped and poorly ventilated houses, limited access to \nwater and sanitation, and inadequate health facilities. Poor air quality in Mongolia means a high \nincidence of chronic respiratory diseases, adding to the underlying vulnerability of the country. \nThe 20% of the population identified to be at high risk include the elderly (400,000 people); people \nwith chronic diseases (350,000); and people with cancer, immunocompromised people, and those \nrequiring hemodialysis. The health system in Mongolia is poorly equipped to respond to a massive \ninflux of COVID-19 patients. Testing capacity for COVID-19 is inadequate, and there is a lack of \nessential health care equipment and trained medical personnel. There are 18,669 hospital beds \n \n10 Ministry of Finance. 22 April 2020. Draft Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. \n ", "4 \nin Mongolia, but isolation wards and intensive care services are limited. Nursing care centers are \nalso at high risk because they lack the capacity to respond properly.  \n \n7.  Women and small businesses are particularly vulnerable. Women are facing greater \nhardship because of (i) the increased burden of unpaid care work; (ii) their predominant role in \nhealth care (82% women); and (iii) their active participation in family and sole-entrepreneur-owned \nbusinesses (nearly 60% of entrepreneurs are women), which have been affected by the economic \nslowdowns and mobility restrictions. Further, the crisis has had an impact on gender-based \nviolence, as evidenced by the large increase in the number of hotline calls and women resorting \nto shelters since the start of the pandemic.  \n \n8.  Mongolia  has  a  pre-pandemic  record  of  generally  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement following a difficult economic period before 2017. Given its dependency on \ncommodity prices, Mongolia suffers from a pronounced boom-bust economic cycle. Following the \nlast episode of economic slowdown, Mongolia entered into an International Monetary Fund (IMF) \n3-year extended fund facility (EFF) in May 2017. Economic growth has been robust since then, \ngrowing by 5.3% in 2017, 7.2% in 2018, and 5.1% in 2019. Mongolia\u2019s other key macroeconomic \nperformance indicators were positive and/or stable in 2019. The overall fiscal balance was 1.4% \nof GDP, the second consecutive year of an overall fiscal surplus. The structural budget deficit was \na modest 1.7% of GDP and consistent with the Law on Fiscal Stability.11 Total exports hit a historic \nhigh of $7.6 billion, foreign direct investment (FDI) remained stable at $2.1 billion, and the balance \nof payments recorded a surplus of $0.5 billion. This brought gross foreign exchange reserves up \nto $4.4 billion (5.8 months of imports) in 2019.  \n \n9.  Fiscal policy tightening and growth recovery in recent years have reduced debt, but \nchallenges remain. Revenues have steadily increased since 2017, supported by improved tax \nadministration and stronger demand for Mongolia\u2019s exports. Expenditures have been more tightly \ncontrolled, and the public investment program has been strengthened. This has reduced public \ndebt (including central bank liabilities) from 109.1% of GDP in 2016 to 79.1% of GDP in 2019. It \nhas also turned a fiscal deficit of 15.3% of GDP in 2016 into surpluses of 2.6% in 2018 and 1.4% \nin 2019. The less favorable economic outlook is combining with a considerable amount of external \ndebt repayments, including maturing bonds during 2020\u20132024, to present important challenges \nfor fiscal policy.12 Average inflation increased from 6.8% in 2018 to 7.3% in 2019 but remains \nbelow the inflation target of 8.0%. The Bank of Mongolia gradually tightened its monetary policy \nstance from the end of 2018 because of increased downward pressure on the currency and the \npass-through  to  inflation.13 Underlying  issues  in  the  banking  sector  around  asset  quality \ndeterioration remain, and bank recapitalization is still incomplete. These issues were identified in \nthe IMF program and constitute important policy priorities going forward.  \n \n10.  The CDEP and monetary policy easing demonstrate Mongolia\u2019s comprehensive \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 27 March 2020, the government launched the CDEP, \nannouncing its intention to introduce $1.8 billion worth of measures to counter the negative \nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Planned financing will come from budget savings (24%), \nforgone government revenue (23%), and the public investment program (53%). Under the current \nfinancing scenario, the overall fiscal balance for 2020 will deteriorate by 4.1 percentage points of \n \n11  Under the law, the structural budget deficit shall not exceed 2% of GDP. Law of Mongolia on Fiscal Stability      \n(certified translation): http://www.iltod.gov.mn/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Law-of-Mongolia-on-Fiscal-Stability.pdf \n(last accessed on 16 April 2020). \n12  Total external debt repayment during 2020\u20132024, including international bonds, external loans, and government \nguarantees, is forecast to be $5.9 billion. \n13  More information on monetary policy and inflation is included in Appendix 6. \n ", "5 \nGDP from the 2019 level to \u20132.7%. The Bank of Mongolia reduced the policy rate twice (in March \nand  April  2020),  by  2  percentage  points  to  9.0%.  It  also  lowered  the  mandatory  reserve \nrequirements for local currency liabilities, reduced the minimum prudential requirement on liquidity \nratios by 5 percentage points to 20%, and waived consumer and housing mortgage credit \nrepayments. The CDEP covers three areas (Appendix 5):14 \n \n(i)  Measures supporting citizens. At least 1.8 million people will benefit from social \nprotection support for vulnerable households and individuals affected by the crisis. The \nplanned spending is $474 million.  \n(ii)  Support to vulnerable businesses and fiscal stimulus measures. An estimated \n30,000 companies and 233,000 herder households will be reached by measures to \nsupport vulnerable businesses. Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) \nwill receive financial support to protect jobs. This package includes (a) fiscal stimulus \nmeasures, such as support for enhanced preparation at border crossing points to \nfacilitate  exports  (e.g.,  through  vehicle  disinfection);  and  (b)  increased  financial \nassistance for heightened monitoring  of manufacturing, service, and catering facilities \nin their efforts to comply with regulations aimed at preventing the spread of infection. \nSpending equivalent to $1.3 billion is planned, although this package is not yet fully \nfinanced. \n(iii)  Public health protection. Planned spending of $71.8 million will finance measures that \nprotect lives, health, and safety by (a) preparing for and responding to a potential \nCOVID-19  epidemic  within  the  country;  and  (b)  investigating  and  controlling  case \nclusters with testing, contact tracing, and isolation. The added expenditure will increase \nhealth sector spending in 2020 by 14.9% over 2019. \n \n11.  The CDEP is aligned with the country\u2019s macroeconomic framework, and public debt \nremains sustainable. The government\u2019s expenditure program is consistent with the Law on \nFiscal Stability. The government aims to use existing programs (such as the Child Money \nProgram) and channels (such as income tax, sales tax, and social security contributions) to deliver \nthe program, ensuring that the funds can reach intended targets quickly and efficiently. As \nMongolia has been under an IMF program since 2017, it was subject to regular IMF reviews until \nthe end of 2018. The IMF conducted a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) as part of the Article IV \nConsultation in September 2019.15 The DSA indicates that, although debt is high, positive \ndynamics related to high nominal growth, access to concessional financing, and strong fiscal \nperformance mean that the debt ratio has been declining and is expected to fall significantly up \nto 2024. Updated analysis conducted by ADB indicates that public debt will rise by 7.3 percentage \npoints to 86.4% in 2020 (slightly above the 2019 level) before resuming its downward trajectory \nin 2021 and decreasing steadily through 2025.16 The planned assistance under this program of \n$100 million, at 0.9% of current public debt, increases the debt\u2013GDP ratio by 0.7 percentage \npoints and falls within a sustainable fiscal framework to manage the potential impact on debt and \nfiscal sustainability. Further, the spread on Mongolian government bonds in international bond \nmarkets has widened by 5.76%\u20138.72% since 27 February 2020, indicating that other sources of \nexternal finance are not currently cost-effective options.  \n \n \n14  Further details are provided in section B.  \n15  IMF. 2019.  Mongolia 2019 Article IV Consultation. Washington, DC (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n16  Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ADB has consulted \nwith the IMF on this matter. \n ", "6 \nB.  Rapid Response to COVID-19 Pandemic and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.  Mongolia has taken  prompt and decisive  actions to respond to the COVID-19 \npandemic and remains on high alert.17 Shortly after the initial outbreak in the PRC, the National \nSecurity Council imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and limit regional \ntransmission. A $4.3 million allocation from the state budget in February 2020 was used to procure \nmedical equipment and supplies to ensure that dedicated hospitals and health institutions can \nprevent transmission and respond to COVID-19 cases. The National Emergency Commission \nissued six directives between 21 February 2020 and 22 March 2020 that imposed bans on \ninternational travel\u2015currently no commercial air routes are available to enter or exit Mongolia. \nGiven Mongolia\u2019s strategic location in connecting the PRC and the Russian Federation, the \ncountry\u2019s control of the spread of COVID-19 and subsequent efforts to strengthen testing and \ndisease control protocols will have important benefits for its neighbors and for East Asia and \nEurope. The CDEP contains measures that will support economic recovery through trade and \nsafeguard critical supply chains, thus planting the seeds for a recovery based on regional trade \nand integration. The government has formulated the National Emergency Response Plan, which \nidentifies that $240 million is required to support the procurement of 10,000 units of priority \nemergency  medical  equipment,  increase  surveillance  capacity,  ensure  adequate  supply  of \nmedicines,  strengthen  laboratory  and  testing  protocols,  and  provide  essential  support  to \nvulnerable populations including food, fuel, and medical support.  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition. As Mongolia\u2019s largest development partner, 18 ADB has a major \nrole to play in convening all stakeholders. ADB\u2019s COVID-19 support is consistent with pillar 1 \n(economic  and  social  stability)  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia19 and \noperational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030.20 The  program  supports  implementation  of  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration \noperational plan under Strategy 2030\u2014 particularly its pillar on promoting regional public goods, \nwhich include joint control of transboundary health risks.21 It is also aligned with the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) 2030 operational cluster on human development, \nwhich highlights \u201caddressing pandemic risks and control of communicable diseases\u201d as critical \nregional public goods with significant positive externalities.22 \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s package of support for COVID-19 in Mongolia includes rapid response measures \nsuch as reallocating $1.4 million in early February under an existing health sector operation to \nsupport the procurement of emergency health equipment, preparing a small-scale technical \nassistance project for emergency response systems in the health sector, and approving a $1.0 \nmillion grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Facility to support further procurement of \nemergency medical equipment.23 It also includes short- and medium-term responses, such as a \n \n17  The initial outbreak has led to a United Nations resolution on global solidarity on COVID-19 that emphasizes the \nneed for regional and global cooperation. \n18  ADB  represents  35%  of  all  official  development  assistance  flows  to  Mongolia.  2018  data  taken  from \nhttps://stats.oecd.org/.

ADB is also repurposing $24 million under ADB\u2019s support to the Credit Guarantee \nFund to directly support small and medium-sized enterprises in distress. 24 The proposed COVID-\n19 Rapid Response program under the pandemic response option will support these efforts by \nhelping the government manage the economic impact and respond to the health and social \nprotection needs the pandemic has created.   \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s experience in each of these sectors can help the government translate these \nresponses into permanent structural improvements. ADB has long been a major development \npartner in Mongolia\u2019s health sector, supporting systemic reforms (notably the Health Law of 2016 \nand laws related to health insurance, medicines, and medical devices) and medical care and \nservices. ADB has combined this support with investment lending, including a $163.51 million \nmultitranche financing facility committed in 2019.25 ADB\u2019s engagement in social protection has \nincluded support for the design and financing of social welfare programs, as well as ADB\u2019s first-\never stand-alone operation to combat domestic violence. ADB is also deeply involved in helping \nMongolia strengthen disaster response and resilience and is planning its first lending operation in \nthis sector for 2021. ADB is supporting Mongolia\u2019s efforts to diversify the economy and become \nless dependent on mining through investments in agriculture and tourism. Finally, ADB\u2019s long-\nstanding engagement with the government on fiscal and macroeconomic management is a major \nadvantage. This enabled ADB to help the government shape its response to the COVID-19 \npandemic and the CDEP, including the policies to reduce expenditures and raise revenues to help \nfinance the CDEP. ADB has also worked with the government to sharpen the CDEP\u2019s focus on \nwomen, including more explicit targeting, and to strengthen the arrangements for monitoring the \nimplementation of both the CDEP and the proposed ADB COVID-19 rapid response program.  \n \n16.  Coordination with IMF and other development partners. Close coordination with the \nIMF is facilitated by the presence of the EFF, which provides a regular mechanism for coordination \nand dialogue among international financial institutions and major development partners. To \nensure that COVID-19 pandemic responses are well-aligned and complementary, ADB is also \nworking on an almost daily basis through the resident mission with the IMF and the World Bank, \nother development partners, and various United Nations agencies, including the Humanitarian \nCountry Team. This operational coordination has been complemented by high-level discussions \nwith the IMF, the World Bank, and the government at a senior management level. The result is \nthat all development partners share a common understanding with the government of the impact \nof  COVID-19  and  the  required  response.  The  World  Bank  has  approved  a  $26.9  million \ninvestment loan in the health sector. Other development partners, including the United Nations, \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, have all made contributions to the COVID-19 response. The Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank (AIIB) has expressed an interest in budget support; discussions are ongoing, \nand ADB teams have shared their experience.

Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n17.  The impact of the proposed program will be that the adverse effects of the COVID-19 \npandemic on the economy are mitigated and poverty is alleviated. The outcome will be negative \nhealth and economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis on vulnerable groups mitigated. The program \nwill have the following three outputs:  \n \n18.  Output 1: Measures and increased fund allocation for social protection programs \nfor the most vulnerable groups implemented. This output will provide social protection support \nto vulnerable households under the CDEP. The CDEP will increase the allocation under the Child \nMoney Program by 50% to MNT30,000 per child per month, and this is expected to reach 1.1 \nmillion children. Private sector workers will be exempt from personal income tax for 6 months \nstarting from 1 April 2020. This is targeted at employees at risk of losing their jobs, so public sector \nworkers are not included. As women are overrepresented in the public sector (60.4%), which is \nnot covered by the program, the target is to ensure that at least 45% of the beneficiaries are \nwomen. Companies whose activities have been stopped because of the government restrictions \nfor  controlling  the  spread  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  will  receive  a  monthly  stipend  of \nMNT200,000 per employee retained by such companies. Individuals will receive reimbursement \nof the value-added tax (VAT) paid in the first quarter of 2020. This is expected to benefit 860,000 \ncitizens, with each gaining an average of MNT47,000. Until September, households will not be \ndisconnected or penalized if their electricity bills are not paid on time.  \n \n19.  Output 2: Measures to safeguard productive sectors and micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises from the downturn implemented. To protect jobs, support will be provided \nto MSMEs, including those engaged in international trade, particularly the import of critical food \nand medical supplies. These measures will not apply to any public or semipublic company or any \nprivate  company  that  is  implementing  public  procurement  contracts.  Businesses  whose \noperations have been impacted will be eligible for a 6-month exemption from the payment of social \ninsurance. At least 50% of these businesses will be owned or run by women. The businesses will \nbe exempt from interest and penalties due on unpaid social insurance premiums before 1 April \n2020. Companies with annual sales of less than MNT1.5 billion will be exempt from paying \ncorporate income tax for 6 months. This is expected to benefit 30,448 vulnerable MSMEs. \nBaseline data suggests that 34.2% of MSMEs are women-owned or run, so a target of reaching \nat least 34.0% of businesses owned by women has been set. Entities that voluntarily reduced \nlease rates for businesses affected by the economic situation will receive tax exemptions on lease \nrevenue. There will a 2-month deferment of customs duties and VAT due on staple products, \nincluding imported goods such as rice, wheat, sugar, and vegetable oil. MSMEs will be provided \nwith increased access to guarantees on loans of less than MNT30 million. Cashmere producers \n(one of the most affected industries) will receive concessional loans, benefitting 233,000 herder \nhouseholds and 47 companies. Agri-companies will receive a 50% reduction on the purchase of \nagricultural equipment, assisting 1,500 companies.  \n \n20.  Output 3: Measures to strengthen infection prevention and control established. \nThese measures will include (i) procuring and supplying essential health care equipment, as well \nas hospital supplies for disinfection and decontamination; (ii) increasing surveillance capacity; (iii) \n \n26  IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nstrengthening laboratory and testing protocols; (iv) enabling the health authorities to increase the \navailability of frontline health workers to promptly respond to the crisis; and (v) exempting drugs \nand health products used for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 from customs duties and \nVAT. These short-term responses will be complemented by a set of medium-term measures \noutside of the CDEP, targeting 2022 achievement, proposed in the government\u2019s  National \nEmergency  Response  Plan.  These  include  (i)  strengthening  35  hospitals  to  meet  national \ninfection prevention and control standards, (ii) improving 210 hospitals to meet national standards \nto manage Severe Acute Respiratory Infection patients, and (iii) enhancing testing capacity and \nensuring  that  75%  of  samples  from  suspected  cases  of  COVID-19  and/or  Severe  Acute \nRespiratory Infection are confirmed within the standard time.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n \n21.  In addition to the pandemic\u2019s effect of reducing government revenues, the CDEP response \nto the crisis will raise expenditures by 11.7% over 2019 (Table 2). The overall fiscal balance will \ndeteriorate by 4.1 percentage points to \u20132.7% ($379 million), and the structural fiscal balance by \n3.4 percentage points to \u20135.1%. According to the Law on Fiscal Stability, the government is \nrequired to finance the structural deficit. This results in financing needs of $713 million. The \ngovernment plans to increase external borrowing by $495 million to finance 69.4% of the structural \ndeficit. The remainder is to come from the stabilization fund and other sources now under \nconsideration, including mobilizing domestic financing. The proposed program will account for \n20.2% of the government\u2019s planned external borrowing. The government is in discussions with \nother development partners, including the IMF, the World Bank, the European Union, and the AIIB \non meeting the remaining external financing needs. \n \nTable 2: Revised Budget Forecasts and Domestic Financing Needs \n2019 Budget  2020 Revised Forecast \n(Pre-COVID-19)  (Post-COVID-19)  \nItem  (% of GDP)  (% of GDP)  ($ million) \nTotal revenues  32.4  30.3  4,231 \nTotal expenditures  31.0  33.0  4,610 \nOverall balance    1.4  (2.7)  (379) \nStructural balancea  (1.7)  (5.1)  (713) \nFinancing plan    5.1  713 \nExternal loans     3.5  495 \nADB CPRO    0.7  100 \nOther ADB COVID-19b    0.2  30 \nOther development partnersc    1.6  227 \nExternal financing gapd    1.0  138 \nStabilization Fund    0.3  36 \nOther (under consideration)    1.3  182 \n() = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = Coronavirus disease, CPRO OVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse Option, GDP = Gross Domestic Product \na The structural balance refers to structural revenue minus total expenditure.

The government has requested a regular loan of $100,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method, \nthe average maturity is 10.9 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.27  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n23.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for the program. The proceeds \nof the loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time). As the CDEP is part of the government budget, it will be subject to \naudit by the National Audit Office. This audit will be finalized and shared with ADB for monitoring \npurposes in June 2021. The program will be implemented in coordination with the ongoing and \nplanned regional technical assistance under the CAREC framework, especially for policy dialogue \nand information sharing on the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The loan will be withdrawn as \na single tranche. The implementation period is 1 March 2020\u201330 June 2021. \n \n24.  Monitoring and evaluation. Several of the initiatives under the CDEP are using existing \ngovernment mechanisms, such as the Child Money Program and the tax administration system. \nThese mechanisms are subject to their own monitoring arrangements, which will be used to \nassess the effectiveness of the CDEP. The MOF has also requested that ADB help strengthen \nmonitoring of the CDEP, including sex-disaggregated data monitoring, under an existing technical \nassistance project.28 The MOF will monitor, evaluate, and regularly report to ADB on areas that \nwill include (i) developments in its macroeconomic and fiscal conditions, including the CDEP; (ii) \nimpacts of the CDEP on poor and vulnerable groups, disaggregated by sex, including the number \nof  beneficiaries  of  cash  transfer  schemes  and  other  social  assistance  programs;  (iii) \nimplementation of its National Emergency Response Plan; and (iv) progress on gender-related \ntargets and indicators in the design and monitoring framework and gender monitoring matrix. In \naddition, there are several instruments for health status monitoring in Mongolia, including the \nannual reports and statistics produced by the Ministry of Health, the annual United Nations \nSustainable  Development Goals  monitoring  undertaken  by the  government  and the  United \nNations Development Programme, as well as the monitoring of health status by the World Health \nOrganization. Finally, ADB\u2019s East Asia Department is preparing a specific tool in the form of a \nregularly updated monitoring report to track the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on key \nindicators,  such  as  employment  and poverty. ADB  will  also  establish  a  platform  approach \ninvolving regular engagement with government, civil society, the private sector, and development \npartners to monitor the situation and assess the effectiveness of the CDEP.29  \n \n \n27  Assessment on risk-bearing capacity has been completed by the Office of Risk Management, and this is reflected \nin ADB. 2020.

DUE DILIGENCE   \n \n25.  Safeguards. No adverse environmental, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples \nimpacts under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) have been identified. The program is \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \n26.  Governance. Mongolia has strong financial management legislation (e.g., Integrated \nBudget Law and the Law on Development Planning), governance structures, and operational \npublic financial management systems in place, including a functional Treasury single account, a \nunified and consistent chart of accounts, and an integrated government debt and financial \nmanagement information system. Despite this, there remain areas for improvement related to the \nefficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of the public financial management system.30 To \naddress this, MOF has adopted the Public Financial Management Reform Strategy, 2018\u20132020, \nsupported by ADB, the World Bank, the European Union,31 and the IMF.32 The strategy aims to \nstrengthen alignment of expenditures and revenue outputs with the originally approved budget, \nimprove the quality of cash flow forecasts and unpredictability in availability of funds, strengthen \nbudget credibility to support public policy effectiveness, and enhance accounting policies and \nreporting frameworks. Over the medium term, ADB will continue to stay engaged.33 \n \n27.  The revised Public Procurement Law adopted in 2013 introduced significant changes in \nthe  public  procurement  system.  Responsibility  for  procurement  was  transferred  to  the \nGovernment Procurement Agency (GPA), now a division of the State Property Administration \nAuthority  after  internal restructuring.  Local  governments  were  given more responsibility  for \nprocurement. The revised law also includes provisions that genuflect to the need to make \nprocurement  processes  more  transparent  and  participative.  The  implementation  of  these \nambitious reforms is ongoing. The Public Procurement Law was amended in 2019 with the aim \nof strengthening transparency and accountability. ADB supported the preparation of this amended \nlaw by providing technical assistance.34 While it is well documented that vulnerability to corruption \ncan undermine accountability throughout the economic and political sphere, Mongolia has also \naddressed these vulnerabilities, e.g., through its active membership of the Anticorruption Initiative \nfor Asia and the Pacific, which is supported by ADB and the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development.35 The main governance risks and (proposed) mitigation measures \nare summarized in Table 3.    \n \n28.

Adverse Impact of Exogenous  Mongolia has taken decisive actions to contain the spread of the \nShocks  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  the  country  but  the \nsocioeconomic impact and the pressure on the country\u2019s health \nsystems are severe.  \n \nMajor slowdown in economic growth. ADB has revised the 2020 \ngrowth  forecast  down  from  6.1% to  2.1%.  A  protracted  global \neconomic crisis because of the COVID-19 pandemic further worsens \nthis outlook considerably. Mongolia was already vulnerable coming \ninto this crisis with growth in Q4 2019 affected by falling growth in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and moderating commodity prices. \n \nThe  slowdown  puts  a  fiscal  strain  on  the  country.  Total \ngovernment revenue has fallen by 10.6% year over year as of \nFebruary 2020. Government revenue will drop by at least 9.2% for \n2020 from the approved 2020 budget. This will result in a budget \ndeficit equal to 2.7% of GDP (or $379 million), an increase of 4.1 \npercentage points from the 2019 budget.  \n \nThe balance of payments is also under severe pressure. In the \nfirst quarter of 2020, the current account balance deteriorated by \n92.7% mainly because of lower inflows of merchandise exports in \nFOB terms (\u201349.2%) and tourism receipts (\u201356.6%). Net foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and portfolio investment decreased by 5.0% \nand 85.2%, respectively, resulting in the shrinkage of the financial \naccount  surplus  by  26.1%.  As  a  result,  the  overall  balance  of \npayments deteriorated by 259.5% to $350 million in deficit, and this \nextremely negative trend is expected to continue.  \n   \nSocial Impacts. The government estimates that about 20% (over \n772,000 persons) of the population are at \u201chigh risk\u201d. These include \nelderly people (250,000), people with chronic diseases (350,000), \nand other categories of people, including those dealing with cancer, \nhemodialysis, and immunosuppression. There are 18,669 hospital \nbeds in Mongolia, of which 2,916 beds (including only 633 intensive \ncare beds) are dedicated to COVID-19 treatment. The health system \nin Mongolia is poorly equipped to respond to a massive influx of \nCOVID-19 patients.  Given that many people have respiratory pre-\nconditions because of the poor air quality in Ulaanbaatar and other \nurban areas in the country, this would quickly overburden health \nfacilities and lead to a disproportionally high level of deaths  \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  21 \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n  Significant  job  losses  and  increased  poverty.  The  national \npoverty line was 28.4% in 2018, and the pattern in Mongolia shows \nthat poverty is impacted significantly by economic downturns and \nrecovers slowly. A further 14.9% of people live just above the poverty \nline and are highly vulnerable to shocks. According to the annual \nsurvey of Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry \n(MNCCI) (released in April), business confidence in Mongolia is \nmuch weaker in 2020 than it was last year. The survey results show \nthat businesses expect a rising trend in unemployment and poverty, \nand  a  two-fold  decline  in  expected  earnings.  The  MNCCI  also \nestimates that as many as 20% of all jobs could be lost.  Micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) will bear the brunt of these \ndifficulties,  which  will  have  a  knock-on  impact  on  employment. \nDespite limited data on social and gender impacts of the COVID-19 \nfor Mongolia, women are facing greater hardship because of an \nincreased burden of unpaid care work and their predominant role in \nthe health sector operations (82% women). Women comprise more \nthan 60% of entrepreneurs in the country. Most of them run micro \nand family-owned businesses in industries that have been adversely \naffected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such \nas wool, cashmere, farming, services, and retail.  \n \n2.  Countercyclical  development  Government  has  introduced  a  major  countercyclical \nexpenditures  development expenditure program (CDEP) to respond to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The CDEP includes three areas of support:  \n \nMeasures supporting citizens \nThe CDEP increases income support to poor and vulnerable groups \nand households. Particularly, it will increase the allocation under the \nChild Money Program by 50% to MNT30,000 ($11) per child per \nmonth. It will reach 1.1 million children. The CDEP also supports a \nfull exemption for private sector workers of personal income tax from \n1 April 2020 for 6 months. This is targeted at employees deemed at \nrisk of losing their jobs (public sector workers have not been included \nin this measure). Companies whose activities were stopped because \nof the government restrictions for controlling COVID-19 will receive \na monthly stipend of MNT200,000 ($72 equivalent) per employee. \nIndividuals will receive reimbursement of the VAT paid in Q1. This \nwill benefit 860,000 citizens, each gaining an average of MNT47,000 \n($17 equivalent). Households will not be disconnected nor will they \nreceive a penalty in case their electricity bill is paid late. This \nmeasure is in place until September 2020.  \n \n  Support to MSMEs and wider economic stimulus measures. \nBusinesses whose operations have been impacted will be eligible for \na 6-month exemption from the payment of social insurance. These \ncompanies will be exempt from interest and penalties due on unpaid \nsocial insurance premiums before 1 April 2020. Companies with \nsales lower than MNT1.5 billion ($541,000 equivalent) will be exempt \nfrom paying corporate income tax for a duration of 6 months. This is \nexpected  to  benefit  28%  of  private  sector  entities  or  30,448 \ncompanies.  Entities  that  voluntarily  reduced  lease  rates  for \nbusinesses  affected  by  the  economic  situation  will  receive  tax \nexemptions on lease revenue.  \n \n ", "22  Appendix 4 \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n  There will be a 2-month deferment of customs duties and VAT due \non staple products, including such imported goods as rice, wheat, \nsugar, and vegetable oil. The purpose of this support is to help and \nincentivize these companies to retain their employees to minimize \nthe impact on unemployment in the country. \n \nThe economic stimulus measures include enhanced preparation at \nborder crossing points, such as vehicle disinfection, to facilitate \nexports; as well as provision of increased support to and heightened \nmonitoring of manufacturing, service, and catering facilities in their \nefforts to comply with regulations related to the prevention of the \nspread of infection. A large number of public capital projects (1,500) \nwill be brought forward to aid more than 15,000 contractors and \n150,000 employees. MSMEs will be provided with an increased \naccess to guarantees on loans of less than MNT30 million ($10,000 \nequivalent).  Cashmere  producers,  one  of  the  largest  affected \nsectors, will receive concessional loans. This is expected to benefit \n233,000 herder households and 47 companies. Agri-companies will \nreceive 50% reduction on the purchase of agriculture equipment. \nThis is expected to assist 1,500 companies. \n \nPublic  health  protection.  Under  this  package,  measures  that \nprotect human  lives, health, and safety will be implemented. It \ncomprises a significant increase of funding in the health sector, \nwhich will be under strain because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \nadditional funding will be used for (i) the procurement and supply of \nessential  health  care  equipment,  and  hospital  supplies  for \ndisinfection  and  decontamination;  (ii)  increasing  surveillance \ncapacity; (iii) strengthening laboratory and testing protocols; (iv) \nenabling the health authorities to increase the availability of front line \nhealth workers to promptly respond to the crisis; and (v) exempting \ndrugs and health products used for the diagnosis and treatment of \nCOVID-19 from customs duties and VAT.  \n \n3. Pre-shock record of generally  In  2019,  Mongolia\u2019s  key  macroeconomic  performance \nsound  macroeconomic  indicators were positive and/or stable. The overall and primary \nmanagement  fiscal balances both recorded surpluses\u2014for the 2nd consecutive \nyear\u2014equal to 1.4% and 3.7% of GDP, respectively. The structural \nbudget deficit was a modest 1.7% of GDP and thus consistent with \nthe Law on Fiscal Stability. Total exports hit a historical high at $7.6 \nbillion, FDI remained stable at $2.1 billion, and the balance of \npayments had a surplus of $0.5 billion, enabling an increase of gross \nreserves to $4.4 billion. GDP growth remained robust at 5.1%.  \n \n  Fiscal performance has greatly improved since 2017. Revenues \nhave steadily increased since 2017, supported by measures to \nimprove tax administration and benefitting from stronger demand for \nMongolia\u2019s exports. Expenditures have been more tightly controlled, \nand efforts have been made to strengthen the public investment \nprogram. This positive performance has allowed the government to \nreduce  government  debt  (including  central  bank  liabilities)  from \n109.1% of GDP in 2016 to 79.1% of GDP in 2019 (a 30 percentage \npoint reduction) and to turn the fiscal deficit of 15.3% of GDP in 2016 \nto a surplus of 2.6% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019. Challenges remain  \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  23 \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n  over the composition of expenditure, optimization of expenditures \nstructure, and fiscal governance.  \n \nMonetary  policy  was  consistent  with  promoting  external \nbalances, restoring confidence, and enabling increasing net \ndomestic credit. Although average inflation increased from 1.1% in \n2017 to 7.3% in 2019, this was still below the Parliament-approved \ninflation target of 8%.   The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) cut the policy \ninterest rate from 11.0% to 10.0% in March 2020, reduced the \nreserve requirement for MNT by 2 percentage points to 8.5%, and \nnarrowed the interest rate corridor to plus and minus 1% from the \npolicy interest rate. The BOM also made amendments to the Asset \nClassification  and  Provisioning  Procedure  to  (i)  extend  loan \nclassification terms from 15 days to 90 days for consumer loans, \nfrom 31 days to 91\u2013120 days for past-due arrears, and from 90 days \nto 121 days for non-performing loans; (ii) ease requirements on \nimpaired consumer and business loans; (iii) waive conservation \nbuffer  requirements  on  the  banks\u2019  capital;  and  (iv)  reduce  the \nminimum liquidity ratio from 25% to 20%. Further, all banks were \nasked to reduce small transaction fees by 20%\u2013100% during the \nemergency  period.  In  April  2020,  the  BOM  allowed  banks  to \npostpone  housing  mortgage  loan  (impaired)  repayments  by  3 \nmonths. The BOM also cut the policy interest rate by a further \npercentage point to 9.0% and allowed banks to postpone consumer \nloan (impaired) repayments by up to 12 months. \n \nChallenges remain in the banking sector. The following three \nstructural benchmarks under the IMF program in the banking sector \nwere not met: (a) Banks will book the provisioning gap identified by \nthe asset quality review (AQR) and reclassify their assets to the non-\nperforming category in line with the AQR; (b) Based on the AQR \nfindings and advice provided by external experts, regulation on asset \nclassification and provisioning to be further improved in consultation \nwith  IMF  staff;  (c)  Financial  Stability  Council  finalization  and \npublication of an non-performing loan (NPL) resolution strategy. The \nrecapitalization of the banks is still incomplete. Banking sector reform \nwill therefore be an important policy area going forward. Recently, \nthe BOM submitted a draft Banking Sector Reform Program for \n2020\u20132023 for parliamentary discussion. This medium-term program \nincludes 5 core objectives and 49 reform actions, including the \nrecapitalization. The draft program will address (i) bank ownership \nconcentration  and  governance,  (ii)  modernization  of  bank \nsupervision, (iii) the IMF program, (iv) improvement of the AML-CTF \nsystem, and (v) modern banking operations and FinTech.  This \nprovides some confidence that these issues are at the top of the \npolicy reform agenda. \n \n4. Structural Reforms  Mongolia has taken decisive action to respond to the COVID-19 \nsituation. Shortly after the initial outbreak in the PRC, the National \nSecurity Council (comprising the President, the Prime Minister, and \nthe  Speaker  of  Parliament)  imposed  restrictions  on  air  travel \nmovements  across  borders  and  nationwide  school  closures  to \nprevent community transmission. \n \n \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n  The National Emergency Commission (chaired by the Deputy Prime \nMinister)  was  convened  and  is  currently  the  responsible  body \noverseeing  the  government\u2019s  response.  It  issued  six  directives \nbetween 21 February 2020 and 22 March 2020, which imposed \nadditional  restrictions  on  international  travel  to  the  point  where \ncurrently no commercial air routes are available to enter or exit \nMongolia.  Further  measures  included  the  cancellation  of  public \nevents, mandatory quarantine measures, and restrictions on retail \nservices. The government has assigned the highest possible risk \nrating to the emergency under the Law on Disaster Protection. It has \nallocated $4.3 million from the state budget to respond to urgent \nneeds.  The endorsed National Emergency Response Plan  requires  \naround  $240  million  to  support  the  procurement  of  emergency \nmedical equipment, increase surveillance capacity, ensure adequate \nsupply of medicines, strengthen laboratory and testing protocols, \nand provide  food, fuel, medical and other essential support to \nvulnerable populations including.  \n \nThe  country  remains  in  a  state  of  high  preparedness.  \nRespiratory diseases make up a high proportion of the burden of \ndisease in Mongolia; the Ministry of Health (MOH) has identified 20% \nof the population (over 772,000 citizens) to be at high risk. The $4.3 \nmillion allocated from the state budget in the first quarter of 2020 has \nbeen used to procure medical equipment and supplies to ensure that \ndedicated hospitals and health institutions can prevent transmission \nand respond to COVID-19 cases. In anticipation of the worsening \nemergency, the  government is planning to further  increase the \nexpenditure in the health sector to strengthen the response capacity \nof local health authorities and medical facilities. In Ulaanbaatar as \nwell as provincial level hospitals, there is a shortage of essential \npriority equipment and medical supplies. Overall, 10,000 units of \npriority medical equipment and supplies nationwide are needed to \nrespond to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nThe government is planning medium-term improvements to the \nhealth sector. As part of the National Emergency Response Plan, \nthe government will enhance testing, diagnosis, and disease control \nsystems in the country. In addition, ADB is preparing additional \nfinancing  under  an  existing    operation,a  which  will  increase \ndiagnostic and treatment capacity of hospitals to manage Severe \nAcute Respiratory Infection  patients, establish a national medical \ncountermeasures stockpile in Ulaanbaatar , and expand the project \nsites  for  upgrading  sterilization  departments  in  tertiary  and \nsecondary hospitals nationwide. \n \n5. Debt Sustainability  The countercyclical expenditure plan does not affect the overall \nsustainability  of  Mongolia\u2019s  debt.  The  International  Monetary \nFund (IMF) conducted a debt sustainability analysis as part of the \nArticle IV Report produced in September 2019.b  \n \nAccording to the IMF, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio under the baseline \nscenario is forecast to fall significantly by 16 percentage points from \n2018 to 2024. The baseline scenario for 2020\u20132024 assumed and \nreflected the following:  \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  25 \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n   \n(i)  high nominal GDP growth around 12.5% per annum, based \non a moderate and stable level of real GDP growth of around \n5.4% per annum;  \n(ii)  a  moderate  level  of  annual  inflation  of  6.7%,  which  is \nconsistent with the Bank of Mongolia (central bank) current \ninflation target of 8.0% and the medium-term target of 6.0%, \nand a stable exchange rate;  \n(iii)  The primary fiscal balance is projected to remain in the range \nof \u20130.5%\u20133.0%, showing no significant and adverse pressure \non the overall fiscal position; and  \n(iv)  Mongolia  would  retain  access  to  concessional  budget \nsupport and project loans so that annual average effective \ninterest rate remains low at 2.7% over 2020\u20132024. \n \nThe IMF assessment  also highlighted that the  public  debt and \nfinancing needs are sensitive to shocks to (i) GDP growth, (ii) \nexchange  rate  depreciation,  and  (iii)  financial  sector  contingent \nliabilities related to banking sector recapitalization. \n \nSince this assessment was conducted last year, growth forecasts for \nMongolia have fallen significantly, and fiscal revenues will decline. \nThe Government of Mongolia\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program \nwill result in an increase in expenditure by 11.7% over the 2019 level. \nConsequently,  the  overall  and  structural  fiscal  balances  will \ndeteriorate by 4.1 percentage points and 3.4 percentage points, \nrespectively,  to deficits of 2.7% ($379 million) and 5.1% ($713 \nmillion).  \n \nADB, in close consultation with the IMF, has calculated the public \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio for two scenarios and has assumed no change in \ncentral bank liabilities. Both scenarios show a temporary increase in \nthe debt\u2013GDP level in 2020 before a return from 2021 to 2025 to the \nprevious trend and downward trajectory. This assumes that an \neconomic recovery would start in 2021, and that there is a stable \ngrowth trajectory from 2022\u20132025. The ratio remains sensitive to \nrisks associated with GDP growth, balance of payments shocks and \ntheir  impact  on  exchange  rate  and  fiscal  balances,  and  the \nrealization of contingent liabilities. For more detail, please refer to the \nDebt Sustainability Analysis (Linked Document 11). \n \n6. Coordination with the IMF  The IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) provides for a regular \nmechanism  for  coordination  and  dialogue  among  international \nfinancial institutions and major development partners. The IMF is in \ndiscussion with the government for a loan from its Rapid Financing \nInstrument designed to provide support in the event of balance of \npayment challenges. ADB maintains a close ongoing dialogue with \nthe IMF, and this has continued since the onset of the pandemic with \nregular sharing of analysis on the economic situation.  \n \nThe Article IV of September 2019 highlighted the vigorous recovery \nof Mongolia\u2019s economy from the recent downturn. Economic growth \naccelerated to 8.6% in the first quarter of 2019, overall fiscal balance \nturned into surplus in 2018,   Gross \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n  international reserves have increased by $2.5 billion since 2016. The \nrecovery stems from a stronger policy framework, significant official \nfinancing, and a rebound in external demand. Notwithstanding the \nprogress, Mongolia remains vulnerable to external shocks given its \nhigh debt levels and the economy\u2019s dependence on mineral exports. \n \nThe IMF has provided an assessment letter to ADB that updates the \nassessment of Mongolia\u2019s economic conditions and policies since \nthe 2019 Article IV consultation. As a result of slowing growth in the \nPRC and a fall in commodity prices, the Mongolian economy had \nalready decelerated in 2019 and now faces strong headwinds due to \nthe global COVID-19 outbreak. To mitigate the negative impact, both \nfiscal and monetary policies are poised to loosen materially. The \nchallenge  will  be  to  support  economic  output  while  preserving \nmacroeconomic stability. Key challenges include large near-term \nexternal refinancing needs and limited international reserves. The \nsixth review under the EFF remains delayed, and the program is \nscheduled to expire in May 2020. \n \na   ADB. 2012.

The \nResponse Plan  plan  is  overseen  by  the  State  Emergency  Commission,  and  the  National \nEmergency  Management  Agency  leads  the  implementation.  The  plan\u2019s  key \nmeasures include the setting of the level of quarantine needed; closures of borders; \nthe  conduct  of  surveys  of  the  current  situation;  the  importation  of  essential \nequipment,  food,  and  fuel;  the  training  of  health  personal  on  emergency \npreparedness; the creation of a database on the health conditions of people aged \n60 and above; and the improvement of health facilities. The protocols are divided \ninto pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases. Initial estimates from the \nNational Emergency Response Plan suggest overall needs are currently about \n$240 million, of which $50 million is required for the health sector alone.  \nSocial distancing  The  governments  has  introduced  social  distancing  measures  to  contain  the \nprotocols  disease, such as a ban on mass gatherings and celebrations, the closure of schools \nuntil 1 September, partial closure of restaurants and bars, encouragement to \ncompanies to work from home, and guidance on the use of face masks and \nhandwashing. A hotline has been established by  the government to support \nsurveillance measures. \nTravel  No commercial airlines can travel to Mongolia. Initial restrictions were imposed on \ntravel from the People\u2019s Republic of China in February and have gradually been \nextended to cover all destinations in March. The current ban lasts until 31 May but \nmay be extended further. Some government-organized charter flights have been \narranged to facilitate the return of Mongolian nationals living abroad. Restrictions \nare also in place on internal travel between aimags (provinces). A total of 51,742 \nvehicles and 70,981 passengers have been checked at border points (as of 17 April \n2020). Disinfection and observation protocols are in place at border points. \nObservation and  Since the outbreak, almost 5,000 people have been put under observation.

Historically, Mongolia has experienced high inflation (often double-digit inflation) mainly \ndue to commodity boom and bust cycles, procyclical fiscal expansions, supply shocks, balance \nof  payments  crises  and  their  negative  transmissions  to  inflation  through  exchange  rate \ndepreciation. However, inflation has been below the Bank of Mongolia (BOM)\u2019s target since July \n2015 and has remained consistent with the target since the (Figure A6.1).  \n \n2.  In 2018 and 2019, annual inflation moved closer to the BOM target due to economic \nrecovery, supply-side factors, and exchange rate pass through on imported goods and services. \nInflation moderated towards the end of 2019 and in 2020 in response to slower economic growth, \nsignificantly lower credit growth, the fading impact of supply shocks and a more stable exchange \nrate. The continued increase in foreign exchange reserves since 2017 has enabled reserves to \nreach 5.8 months of merchandise goods and services import cover, which has positively affected \nforeign exchange market expectations (Figure A6.2).  \n \n3.  As of March 2020, inflation reached 6.4%, and annual average inflation is expected to \nmoderate from 7.3% in 2019 to 6.6% in 2020 according to Asian Development Bank ADB \nforecasts1 as the economy slows, demand-pull inflationary pressure falls, and the demand for \nforeign exchange decreases in line with reduced imports of goods and services. The International \nMonetary Fund, World Bank, and the BOM\u2019s inflation forecasts in 2020 all remained lower than \nthe targeted level of inflation.   \n \nFigure A6.1: Inflation and policy rate (%)  Figure A6.2: Exchange rate and FX reserves \n16 2900 5\n14 MNT/USD \nexchange rate, \n2600 4\n12 Policy rate LHS\n10\nCentral bank target 2300 3\n8\nGross FX \n6\n2000 reserves, RHS  2\n4 Annual ($ billion)\ninflation\n2 12-month\u2026  1700 1\n0\n-2 1400 0\n5 6 7 8 9 0 5 6 7 8 9 0\n1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2   2 2 2 2 2 2  \nSources: The Bank of Mongolia. 2020.
