Mechanisms  to \nachieve  this  objective  will  include:  (i)  removing  legal  and  regulatory  constraints  inhibiting  rice \ncommercialization, (ii) improving productivity of paddy crops and consistency in quality of milled \nrice,  (iii)  enhancing  rice  value  chain  support  services,  and  (iv)  addressing  risks  of  climate \nchange through mitigation and adaptation.5 The program is consistent with (i) ADB\u2019s Operational \nPlan  for  Sustainable  Food  Security  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific; 6 (ii)  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Cambodia,  2011\u20132013;7 and  (iii)  the  agriculture  sector  assessment,  strategy  and \nroadmap.8 The  program  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Cambodia, \n2011\u20132013.9 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nAgriculture  remains  the  dominant  sector  in  the  Cambodian  economy, contributing \n32% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employing 60% of the workforce, while 80% of the \npopulation depends  on the  sector for their  livelihood.10 The  agriculture sector  has  been  one  of \nthe  main  engines  of  economic  growth,  achieving  steady  growth  during  2002\u20132012.11 Within \nagriculture, rice accounts for over 90% of the cropped area, the production from which is mostly \nconsumed  domestically.  The  rice  subsector  accounts  for  about  50%  of  the  agriculture  sector \noutput.  The  government  considers  that  there  is  an  opportunity  within  the  rice  subsector  for \nsocioeconomic  development,  and  articulated  its  intentions  in  the  Rice  Policy  to  transform \nCambodia into a \u201crice basket\u201d and a major rice exporting country. In this regard, the government \nhas set three important objectives for 2015: (i) the paddy surplus will exceed 4 million tons, (ii) \n                                                \n1   Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF). \n2   Established by International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as trustee. \n3   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4   Government of Cambodia. 2010.  Policy on Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export. Phnom Penh. The \nRice  Policy  elaborated  short  and  medium  term  measures  stated  in  the  2010-2013  Strategy  on  Water  and \nAgriculture (SAW), which aims to achieve enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainable economic growth in \nrural areas through agriculture and water sector programs.  \n\n5   The design was based on the feasibility study in 2012 financed by ADB.

Manila (updated in 2013). \n9   A  sector  modality  is  proposed  for  the  program  to  support  measures  stated  in  the  SAW  and  Rice  Policy.  Line \nministries have the institutional capacity to implement these measures, following significant experience in a large \nnumber of previous sector development projects financed by ADB and other development partners.  \n\n10   Agriculture sector includes crop production, forestry, fisheries and animal husbandry. \n11   Sector Assessment (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\nmilled  rice  exports  will  be  at  least  1  million  tons,  and  (iii)  Cambodia  is  to  be  recognized \ninternationally as a rice exporting country. \n \n4. \nCambodia  reported  a  paddy  surplus  estimated  at  3.3  million  tons  in  2010.  Despite  the \nsurplus, nearly one-quarter of the provinces face food deficit. Eleven percent of all households \nare considered food insecure, with many facing a deficit for 1\u20132 months each year. This figure \nrises  during  the  dry  season  to  an  estimated  18%.  Furthermore,  90%  of  all  food-insecure \nhouseholds  are  found  in  rural  areas. 12  Price  fluctuations  across  provinces  are  frequently \nobserved  due  largely  to  (i)  supply  and  demand  imbalances;  and  (ii)  the  movement  of \nunprocessed  paddy  to  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  after  each  harvest  because  of  the  lack  of  in-\ncountry  storage  and  processing  capacity,  limited  marketing  channels,  and  distribution \ninfrastructure. The quality of Cambodian rice for export is variable, and this can be attributed to \ninappropriate production technologies, lack of post-harvest infrastructure, and varied processing \ntechnologies used by a large number of small-scale producers and processors.  \n \n5. \nGiven  the  dominant  position  of the  rice  subsector  in  the  economy, transforming it \nfrom a subsistence into a commercially oriented subsector is a strategic option for Cambodia as \nthis  provides  the  best  opportunity  to  improve  national  food  security  and  expand  rice  exports, \nresulting in reduced poverty. These twin objectives of food security and export expansion will be \nmutually  reinforced  by  paddy  surplus  marketed  increasingly  within  the  country  and  in \ninternational  markets.13 However,  to  achieve  this  outcome  several  critical  binding  constraints \nmust be addressed. \n \n6. \nLack  of  an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory  foundation  for  rice  commercialization. \nFirst, the seed industry is seriously underdeveloped because of the absence of legislation that \ncan protect the interests of and provide incentive for seed developers to produce quality seeds \nfrom  new  genetic  material  available  elsewhere.  Second,  land  and  water  productivity  has  been \nlow,  partly  aggravated  by  the  absence  of  a  legal  framework  for  land  use  planning  and  zoning \nand  the  lack  of  soil  productivity  mapping  and  land  leveling.  Third,  an  inadequate  legal  system \nand  structure  governing  agriculture  associations  and  contract  farming  has  inhibited  the \nopportunity  for  farmers  to  engage  in  cooperative  action  to  achieve  production  efficiencies  and \nimprove  their  bargaining  power.  These  inadequacies  have  also  hampered  efforts  to  link \nproduction  to  the  quality  required  by  domestic  and  international  markets.  Fourth,  the  lack  of  a \nquality  grading  system  and  regulations  on  phytosanitary  measures,  pesticides,  and  fertilizers \nreduces  the  credibility  of  Cambodian  rice  in  international  markets  because  buyers  lack \nconfidence  in  receiving  the  quality  ordered  compared  with  alternative  supply  from  other  rice \nexporting countries. \n \n7. \nSuboptimal use of land and water resources for paddy production. Use of land and \nwater  for  rice  production  is  influenced  by  local  natural  features  and  precipitation  patterns. \nAnnual inundation and subsequent recession of flood waters occur over a large area of flat land \nsurrounding  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  and  the  Mekong  River  flood  plains.  Increased  incidence  of \nflooding and the availability of short maturation rice varieties have given rise to four complex rice \ncropping systems that are continuously shifting in location.14 In response to the need to supply a \ngrowing  domestic  market  and  higher  rice  prices,  farmers  have  extended  the  cultivated  rice \nareas, sometimes into environmentally sensitive areas such as the inundated forest areas.  \n\n                                                \n12 World Food Program. 2008. Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis\u2014Cambodia. Phnom Penh. \n13 The largest market for Cambodian rice is Europe, where 90% of Cambodia\u2019s export went in 2012. Cambodia\u2019s rice \nmarket share in Europe is estimated at about 10%, which is a solid foundation for Cambodia to advance further. \n14  The four rice cropping systems are upland fields, rain-fed lowland fields, deep water paddy fields, and dry season \n\npaddy fields. \n\n \n\n\fInadequate capacities of post-harvest infrastructure to handle increasing volumes \n8. \nof  paddy.  Surplus  paddy  has  mainly  been  exported  wet  to  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  for \nsubsequent drying and processing. Much of this trade has resulted from the lack of post-harvest \ninfrastructure in Cambodia.15 Quality deterioration of moist paddy occurs after harvest if it is not \ndried  to  14%  moisture  content.  While  volumes  of  paddy  supplied  to  markets  have  increased \ndramatically  at  peak  delivery  times,  the  infrastructure  to  handle,  dry,  store,  and  transport  the \nvolumes is not sufficiently developed. As a result, the surplus at peak times is cleared, often at \ndiscounted prices, across the border for processing to prevent quality deterioration and, hence, \nin-country value retention is limited.   \n \n9. \nPaddy production increasingly vulnerable to the changing climate. Cambodia ranks \n8th  among  the  top  15  countries  with  highest  risk  of  impact  from  climate  change. 16  Climate \nchange  has  increased  the  number  of  extreme  climate  events  such  as  floods  and  droughts  in \nCambodia.  These  events  have  driven  farmers  to  consider  alternate  cropping  systems,  and, \nwhere  water  is  available,  dry  season  irrigated  rice  production  is  adopted  as  an  alternative. \nNevertheless, some of these changes are detrimental to the sustainable use of land resources. \nGreater  focus  on  the  early  wet  season  crop  allows  farmers  to  avoid  the  most  severe  flooding \nperiod  as  crops  can  be  harvested  before  its  onset.  Recession  and  late  wet  season  crops \nrespond well to increased fertilizer applications. However, such inappropriate practices will have \na detrimental effect on the structure of certain soil types.  \n\n \n10. \nThe program design was informed by lessons learned and recommendations from ADB's \ncountry  and  sector  assistance  and  program  evaluations.17 Cross-sectoral  linkages  will  also  be \nmaximized  with  urban  development,  energy,  finance,  and  public  sector  projects  in  ADB's \nongoing and planned initiatives. The geographic focus of interventions will (i) enable integration \nwith development initiatives in the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Economic Corridor, (ii) \nleverage the proximity to population centers and export nodes,18 and (iii) facilitate the targeting \nand  strengthening of  value  chains.  Programmatic  synergies  and  coordination  with initiatives of \ndevelopment partners are integrated in the design and result framework and validated based on \nsector-wide  consultations  anchored  through  the  joint  government-donor  Technical  Working \nGroup  on  Water  and  Agriculture  and  Technical  Working  Group  on  Land  Management. 19 \nLessons learned from these consultations and recent project experience include: (i) the need to \ntackle  constraints  in  agricultural  value  chains,  including  farm  productivity  through  strategic \ninterventions  and  high  priority  measures;  (ii)  enhancing  use  of  sector  development  program \nmodality  to  optimize  sector  outcomes;  (iii)  adopting  a  medium-term  approach  informed  by  a \ngreater understanding of the complexity of reforms and the capacity of institutions to implement \nreforms; and (iv) ensuring continuity in capacity building support.20 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  program  comprises  a  policy-based  loan  and  a  project  loan.  The  impact  of  the \n11. \nprogram will be increased net incomes of stakeholders along the rice value chain. The outcome \nwill  be  enhanced  production  of  quality  rice  in  Cambodia  while  preserving  the  natural  resource \nbase.  \n\n                                                \n15  Wet paddy is defined as grains containing 25%\u201330% moisture. \n16  Alliance Development Works. 2012.

In an effort to increase paddy \nfor  export,  these  provinces  have  prioritized  (i)  improving  efficiency  of  land  and  water,  (ii) \nincreasing postharvest handling capacities, and (iii) enhancing resilience of the rice ecosystems. \nAll  three  provinces  are  located  along  the  GMS  Southern  Economic  Corridor  along  which  rice \ncan  be  conveniently  transported  to  Thailand,  Viet  Nam,  and  all  provinces  in  Cambodia.  By \nfocusing on these provinces, there are good opportunities to enhance national food security by \nimproving availability of milled rice for both export and potentially addressing domestic demand \nand supply imbalances. The project will support development priorities of the three provinces to \ncapitalize on legal and regulatory reforms. The project will be scaled up in 2016 and hence will \nhave  significant  implication  for  nationwide  replication  and  consolidating  impacts  of  the  Rice \nPolicy. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  A  conducive  legal  and  regulatory  environment  established  to  facilitate \nclimate-resilient  rice  commercialization.  This  output  will  focus  on  legal  and  regulatory \nreforms  that  (i)  promote  local  seed  production  and  distribution,  (ii)  strengthen  agricultural  land \nmanagement,  (iii)  strengthen  farmers\u2019  organizations  and  promote  contract  farming,  and  (iv) \nfacilitate domestic trading and export of milled rice. The reform initiatives are in the development \npolicy letter (Appendix 3) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \nOutput  2:  Agricultural  land  use  zoning  improved.  This  output  comprises  (i) \n14. \nestablishing  land  use  zones;  (ii)  updating  rice  ecosystems  and  soil  classification  maps  for \nidentification  of  higher  yielding  rice growing  areas;  (iii)  incorporating  agro-ecosystem  analyses \ninto commune land use plans; and (iv) capacity building of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry \nand  Fisheries  (MAFF)  and  Ministry  of  Land  Management,  Urban  Planning  and  Construction \n(MLMUPC)  to  jointly  undertake  agricultural  land  use  planning.  Activities  under  this  output  will \nhelp identify areas that are better suited to rice production for maintaining ecosystem diversity. \nLinked to the zoning initiative, technical procedures will be modified to accommodate guidelines \nfor paddy production to ensure sustainable cultivation practices. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Climate-resilient  rice  value  chain  infrastructure  developed.  This  output \nincludes  high-priority  investments  in  three  major  rice-producing  provinces\u2014Battambang, \nKampong Thom, and Prey Veng and comprises (i) rehabilitating and climate proofing irrigation \nsystems;  (ii)  constructing  paddy  drying  and  storage  facilities;  and  (iii)  constructing  seed \ncleaning,  drying,  grading,  and  storage  facilities.  The  investments  have  been  identified  and \nprioritized  based  on  provincial  development  priorities. 21  Irrigation  rehabilitation  and  climate \nproofing will help increase productivity and cropping intensities. Establishment of paddy drying \nand storage facilities will accommodate paddy supplies at peak periods after harvest to ensure \nbetter  quality  for  processing  and  retained  added  value  in  Cambodia.  Construction  of  seed \ncleaning, drying, grading, and storage facilities will contribute to increased availability of quality \nrice seed\u2014an  integral  component  of rice quality  improvement  and  a  necessary  prerequisite  to \nsupplying export markets with rice of consistent quality. \n \nOutput  4:  Rice  value  chain  support  services  enhanced  to  improve  quality  of \n16. \nCambodian rice. This output comprises (i) improving availability and quality of commercial rice \n\n                                                \n21 List of Prescreened and Eligible Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nOutput  6:  Efficient  program  management  and \n\nseed; (ii) upgrading technical extension material to guide production in various rice ecosystems; \n(iii) capacity building (technical and financial) of mill managers and operators; and (iv) facilitating \naccess  to  credit  by  farmers,  traders,  and  millers.  Activities  under  this  output  will  improve  the \nquality of milled rice and enhance Cambodia\u2019s participation in export markets. \n \n17. \nOutput  5:  Weather-indexed  crop  insurance  piloted.  This  output  comprises  (i) \nundertaking  a  detailed feasibility  study  to  determine  the  appropriateness  of  a weather-indexed \ncrop insurance scheme; (ii) designing the operational parameters, product penetration plan, and \ninstitutional  arrangements;  and  (iii)  piloting  the  scheme  in  selected  areas  in  three  project \nprovinces.

It will tackle these issues by (i) expanding capacity for drying \npaddy in target provinces by 2,000 tons per day by 2018, thereby improving quality and quantity \nof domestically milled rice; (ii) increasing the capacity for paddy storage in target provinces by \n40,000  tons  by  2018;  and  (iii)  facilitating  access  of  millers  to  finance  through  diversified \ncollateral arrangements to increase in-country milling and storage. \n \n25. \nThe  program  will  increase  the  availability  of  quality  seed,  improve  on-farm  land  water \nmanagement  technologies,  improve  drying  and  storage  capacities,  and  improve  resilience  of \nrice cultivation systems. These initiatives are expected to increase crop yields by 25% by 2019. \nAs a result, the program facilitates increased paddy production from 8.0 million tons in 2012 to \n9.5  million  tons  by  2018,  and  increased  milled  rice  exports  to  1.2  million  tons  in  2017  from \n200,000 tons in 2011. By 2017 and beyond, annual rice export revenue is expected to be $600 \nmillion (4.3% of GDP) or value added to the national economy of $120 million (0.9% of GDP).28  \nIncreased  export  revenue  will  help the government  reduce  its  budget  deficit (which  was 6%  in \n2012), replenish official foreign exchange reserves, and increase capacity for servicing external \ndebts.  Moreover,  the  inflow  of  foreign  exchange  will  enable  importation  of  production  inputs, \nwhich will have a significant multiplier impact on production, income generation, and nutrition.29 \nEconomic internal rate of returns of three representative subprojects are estimated in the range \nof 29%\u201331.2%, suggesting that investments under the program are economically viable.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nThe program is aligned with the government's public financial management reform and \nits  decentralization  and  deconcentration  initiatives  that  promote  good  governance  and  reduce \ncorruption. A governance risk assessment and risk management plan was prepared to ensure \nchecks  and  balances  are  in  place. 30 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the MEF, MAFF, MIME, MLMUPC, and MOWRAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe  program  will  promote  inclusive  economic  growth.31 An  improved  rice  value  chain \n27. \nand increased productivity will induce price transmission gains from rice trade. These gains will \ntrickle down to about 1 million rice farming households, the majority of which are categorized as \nlow-income and food insecure. Since women comprise the majority working on farms, they will \nalso benefit the most from these gains.

Limited  involuntary  resettlement  is  envisaged  under  the \nprogram  because  the  screening  process  for  subprojects  prioritized  those  with  insignificant \nresettlement impacts. Rehabilitation of irrigation systems will not cause significant resettlement \nimpacts  since  works  will  be  along  existing  rights  of  way.  Development  of  paddy  drying  and \nstorage  facilities  will  be  located  based  on  the  availability  of  land  for  purchase  on  the  open \nmarket.  A  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  for  two  representative  subprojects \nprepared by the executing agency were endorsed by the government and approved by ADB.33 \nThe  resettlement  framework  and  plans  included  a  well-defined  consultation  mechanism,  an \nentitlement matrix, and a rigorous monitoring mechanism.34 \n \n30. \nprovinces indicate that there were no indigenous peoples living around subprojects locations. \n \n31. \nEnvironmental  safeguards  (category  B).

Takehiko Nakao \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank \n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City \n1550 Metro Manila, the Philippines \n\nDevelopment Program \n\nYour Excellency, \n\nSubject:  Development Policy Letter- Climate Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector \n\n~~-\n\nOn  behalf of the  Royal  Government  of Cambodia  (the  Government),  I  am  writing  to  request  a \n1. \npolicy-based loan and an investment loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a  loan and grant from \nthe  Strategic  Climate  Fund  under the  Pilot  Program  for  Climate  Resilience,  and  a  grant  from  the  Global \nAgriculture and Food Security Program to  implement the Climate Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector \nDevelopment Program (Rice-SDP).  Rice-SDP is  designed to  operationalize the government's  policy on the \nPromotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export (the Rice Policy) approved by the Council of Ministers on \n25  July  2010.  It  is  one  of the  major  policy-based  initiatives  of the  Government,  stimulating  growth  and \npromoting Cambodia as a more significant participant in the international rice market while simultaneously \naddressing  domestic  rice  distribution.  Both  policy  development  and  subproject  investments  have  been \nformulated  through extensive discussions between ADB,  the Government,  and  key sector stakeholders and \nare  consistent  with  the  Government's  agri-cultural  development  strategies .  Moreover,  we  note  a  thematic \nand strategic convergence of a number of recent ADB-financed projects and programs culminating in  Rice \nSOP  such  as  the  Emergency  Food  Assistance  Project,  the  Tonie  Sap  Poverty  Reduction  and  Smallholder \nDevelopment Project, the Water Resources Management Sector Development Program,  and the Emergency \nFlood Protection Project,  each focusing on,  amongst others,  Cambodia's agricultural  sector- and  within  it, \nthe development of the rice sub-sector. \n\n2. \nThe  Government  has  identified  the  rice  sub-sector  as  a  major  engine  for  socio-economic  growth \nthrough  export  expansion.  However,  a  wide  range  of  physical,  climatic,  agro-ecological  and  socio \neconomic  factors  influence  rice  production  and  export.  the future  is  also  confounded  by  the  threat  from \nclimate change to  which Cambodia and  its  agriculture sector,  in  particular is  most vulnerable as  evidenced \nby  recent floods,  drought,  salinity intrusion,  land degradation,  and  loss  of soil  fe1tility.  We recognize  there \nremain  areas  where  agricultural  policy  should  be  strengthened,  together  with  the  institutional  framework \nnecessary  to  support  such  policies  that  should  be  addressed  if the  target  of one  million  tons  of rice \nexports  by  2015,  set  by  the  Government,  is  to  be  achieved.  The  Government  is  fully  committed  to \n\ntlttrua 51\u00a3J  wtniih'iii aru1tlsmm  nt:lmsiimm  !'itrt:ll \nSt,92, Sangkat Wat Phnom, khan  Daun Penh , Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA. \n\nav \n\nn a \n\n~ \n\nn \n\nn \n\na \n\n\" \n\nfU \n\n91fi1~ :  cW~-1\u00a3Jm - t1li\u00a3J<S  Q:lQ:l<S  mum : r::I~~-I\u00a3Jm-<SI\u00a3Jt1l t1l5r::l \n;hon: : 855-23-724 664 \n\nFax: 855-;3-427 7~ 4/ \n\n\fimplement the  policy  and  institutional  development outcomes agreed  under Rice-SDP  as  elaborated  in  the \nPolicy  Matrix  and  ensure that  maximum  leverage  will  be  obtained  from  the  implementation  of associated \ninvestment subprojects. \n\n3. \nThis  letter  is  intended  to  show  Cambodia  as  a  country  eager  and  capable  of addressing  these \ndevelopment challenges - by  increasing resilience to  adversities,  man-made or natural,  internal  or external \neconomic shocks,  and  to  forge  ahead taking the necessary measures for accelerated broad-based growth  led \nby  the  private  sector.  We  believe  that Cambodia's economy  has  the  potential  to  grow  at 7-8%  per  annum \nover  next  20  years  and  beyond.  The  vision  is  to  offer  equal  opportunity  to  all,  whilst  consolidating \nagriculture  as  a  key  economic  sector,  through  the  diversification  of  rice  into  a  more  commercially \norientated  sub-sector  complemented  by  industrial  development,  trade  and  market  liberalization  policies. \nGiven the  limited  size of the  domestic  market,  much of the growth stimulus  will come from  exploiting the \nrising demand  for  Cambodian rice  on  export markets.  The  interventions  outlined  in  Rice-SDP  design  will \nsimultaneously  enhance  rice  productivity  destined  for  domestic  markets  to  ensure  food  security,  reduce \npoverty and malnutrition, and conserve Cambodia's natural resource base. \n\n4. \nWe  believe  that  a  coherent  national  planning  and  strategic  framework  is  needed  for  the \nimplementation  of a  major sector  program  initiative such  as  Rice-SDP.  The Government has  launched  the \nRectangular  Strategy  on  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency  (Phase  2),  which  has  agriculture \ndevelopment  among  its  priorities.  The  four  strategic  \"growth  rectangles\"  are:  (i)  enhancement  of the \nagricultural  sector,  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  infrastructure,  (iii)  private  sector \ndevelopment and employment generation, and (iv) capacity development and  human resource development. \n\n5. \nThe Government has  adopted the Updated National  Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) (2009-13) \nwith milled rice as  a major export item.  It directs 62.4% of resources to rural areas,  with  increased attention \nto  production  activities  including  agriculture  (which  is  dominated  by  rice)  and  rural  development,  and  to \nhealth  and  education  for  human  capital  development.  With  this,  Cambodia  will  make  rapid  progress \ntowards  achieving its  Millennium Development Goals.  The Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry and  Fisheries \n(MAFF) has  prepared the Agricultural Strategic Development Plan 2009-13  in  line with the updated NSDP. \n\n6. \nIn  the  past  decade,  Cambodia  grew  rapidly,  reducing  poverty,  largely  due  to  macro-economic \nstability  and  public  financial  management  reform  whilst  maintaining  a  private  sector  focus.  Fiscal  and \nmonetary policies have been prudent. Cambodia's gross domestic product growth averaged  11% per annum \nduring  the  period  2004-07  before  declining  with  the  financial  crisis.  The  government-driven  stimulus \nprogram  and  proactive  measures  supported  by  ADB-financed  projects  and  those  of other  development \npartners  helped  the  Government  through  the  financial  crisis.  The  resultant  economic  recovery  has  been \nstrong  with  impressive  growth  being  recorded  in  agriculture  (through  rice  commercialization),  tourism, \ngarments,  real  estate,  trade  and  the  services  sector,  that  are  dominated  by  small  and  medium  enterprises. \nEconomic  growth  for  2012  is  estimated  at  7.3%  while  the  medium-term  projection  is  7-8%  per  annum. \nDuring  the  boom  period,  poverty  levels  (as  measured  by  the  recently  revised  poverty  line)  declined  from \n4 7.8%  in  2007, to  19.8%  in 2011. Notwithstanding slight inflationary pressure of recent months,  prices and \nexchange rates have been stable. Interest rates have declined due to  increased competition among banks and \nmicrofinance institutions . \n\n7. \nThe  Government's  Rice  Policy  elaborates  short,  medium  and  longer-term  measures  to  improve \npaddy production,  collection and  processing,  logistics,  marketing and  institutional  mechanism and  is  being \nimplemented  through  the  relevant  ministries  and  agencies.  MAFF  has  prepared  an  Action  Plan  to \nimplement this  Policy. Other ministries  and  agencies  including the  Ministry  of Land  Management,  Urban \nPlanning  and  Construction,  the  Ministry  of Commerce,  the  Ministry  of Environment,  the  Ministry  of \nIndustry,  Mines  and  Energy,  and  the  Ministry  of Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  each  have  identified \ntheir responsibilities under the Rice Policy. \n\n8. \nRice-SDP  will  support  the  Government  in  addressing  two  areas:  (i)  enhancing  capacities  for \nachieving  conducive  policy  and  enabling  environment  for  rice  commercialization,  and  (ii)  strengthening \nvertical  linkages  and  horizontal  clusters  along,  and  within,  the  rice  value  chain.  Strengthened  vettical \n\n2 \n\n\flinkages  between  rice  producers,  processors  and  marketing  agents  will  provide  a  valuable  means  for \norganizing  and  delivering  quality  seed  material  (a  necessary  pre-requisite  for  improved  quality  of paddy \nbeing delivered for processing), technical support services, and aggregated marketing activities. \n\n9. \nSeed quality,  production capacity, prices paid and distribution channels are areas of concern for the \nGovernment.  Seed  quality  is  the  initial  critical  input  in  the  rice  value  chain  that determines  future  quality \npotential with all  subsequent activities  being dependent upon farmers'  ability to access  adequate quantities \nof quality  seed.  Cambodia  Agriculture  Research  and  Development  Institute  (CAROl),  MAFF  research \nstations, commercial seed producers, and farmer associations have  limited capacity to  produce high quality, \ncertified  and  commercial  seed  in  sufficient quantities.  Many  seeds  are  retained  from  the  previous  season's \ncrop  while  significant  quantities  are  still  imported.  The  Government  is  concerned  with  export  of  rice \nvarieties  based  on  imported  seed due to  intellectual  property rights  issues.  The Government wishes to  build \nthe sub-sector on the high quality indigenous Cambodian rice varieties for export. \n\nThe  Government  will  put  in  place  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  seed  production \n10. \ncertification  and  distribution.  Recognizing  that  an  umbrella  seed  policy  will  strengthen  local  seed \nproduction and  distribution,  the  Government (MAFF- the responsible  agency)  has  drafted  a  'Seed Policy' \nprior to  the  release  of the  first  tranche  of the  policy-based  loan.  The  second  tranche  condition will  be the \nissuance of the draft Seed Policy by MAFF. \n\nConsistent with  this  Seed  Policy,  we  recognize the  need  for  MAFF to  (i) draft the  'National  Seed \n11. \nStandards,'  (ii)  draft  the  'Prakas  on  Procedures  for  Providing  Seed  Quality  Certification,'  (iii)  draft  the \n'General  Introduction  to  the  Examination of Distinctiveness, Uniformity and  Stability of New Varieties  of \nPlants,'  and (iv) draft the 'Guidelines for the Conduct of Tests for Distinctiveness, Uniformity and  Stability \nof Rice'. All these four documents have  been drafted as  pre-conditions for the release of the first tranche of \nthe  policy  loan.  The  second  tranche  condition  will  be  the  approval  of these  draft  documents  by  the \nrespective authorities. We believe,  in  non-emergency situations, seed should be produced and distributed on \na  commercial  basis  to  encourage  private  investment  in  the  seed  industry.  The  Government  will  also  take \nrelated  actions  supp011ed  by  Rice-SOP  including strengthening capacity for quality assurance through  seed \ntesting and certification. \n\nWe  recognize  that  efficient  and  sustainable  land  management  is  an  important  aspect  of  rice \n12. \ncommercialization. The Government is  concerned about agricultural land-use inefficiency due to the lack of \nadequate  zoning,  poor  land  management  practices,  and  inadequate  agricultural  land-use  planning.  Soil \nproductivity mapping,  land classification and  land-use zoning remain  incomplete. The legal  framework for \nland-use  is  the stat1ing  point,  based  on  the existing 2001  Land Law which  itself,  is  currently under review. \nThe Government has issued a National  Policy on  Spatial Planning and  is  keen to ensure that land  is  used  in \naccordance with  its  potential and  longer-term  balance between socio-economic development and  protection \nof the environment.  Within this  framework,  a  subordinate Land  Policy \"White Paper\",  including a chapter \non  Land  and  Gender  Policy  has  been  drafted  as  the  condition  for  the  release  of the  first  tranche  of the \npolicy-based  loan.  The \"White Paper\" will  be  issued  as  a condition for the release  of the second tranche of \nthe policy-based loan. \n\nWith  the  above  as  guiding  documents,  it  is  necessary  for  MAFF  to  prepare  and  submit  to  the \n13. \nCouncil of Ministers, a draft Law on  Management and  Use of Agricultural Land,  focusing  inter alia,  on (i) \nwomen's  access  to  information  on  land  administration,  management  and  distribution;  (ii)  women's  equal \nparticipation  and  representation  in  all  commissions  and  committees;  and  (iii)  equal  benefits  for  women  in \nland related  initiatives.  The Government is  committed to  promoting sustainable land  management, and  will \nensure  that  MAFF  prepares  and  the  Government  adopts  a  national  action  program  to  combat  land \ndegradation  in  Cambodia.  To assist in  this  matter,  MAFF will  issue  guidelines for establishing agricultural \nland-use zones,  incorporating measures and targets for involving women in planning and decision making. \n\n14. \nThe Government believes farmer  organizations will  play  a  vital  role  in  the  implementation of rice \ncommercialization  strategies,  policies  and  investments.  The  Government  is  therefore  committed  to \nstrengthen  agricultural  cooperatives.  MAFF,  through  its  extension  staff,  will  assist  in  the  formation  of \n\n3 \n\n\ffarmer  cooperatives.  The  Law  on  Agricultural  Cooperatives  has  been  drafted  by  MAFF  (a  first  tranche \ncondition)  to  assist  in  registration  of existing  cooperatives  and  in  the  establishment  of new  ones,  training \ncooperatives to  become well  managed  business  entities.  Rice-SDP supp01t  is  available to  broaden the  base \nof  farmer  organizations  and  strengthen  their  capacities.  The  second  tranche  condition  requires  the \nsubmission of the draft Law to the National Assembly. \n\n15 . \nWe  recognize  contract  farming  arrangements  offer  potential  to  achieve  quality  and  dependable \nsupplies  if it  is  established  over  a  period  of time  building  long-term  relationships.  The  Government  has \nissued  a  Sub-decree  on  Contract Fanning.  Under Rice-SDP,  paddy producers  and  associations  (especially \nfemale  headed  households)  will  receive  assistance  to  enter  into  contracts  with  interested  parties  on \nfavorable terms, regularize (register) the contract and enforce compliance with  its  provisions. \n\n16. \nThe  Government  will  take  measures  to  establish  Cambodian  milled  rice  standards  and  facilitate \ndomestic  trading  and  export  of rice.  The  Ministry  of Industry,  Mines  and  Energy,  in  consultation  with \nrelevant  ministries  and  the  private  sector,  has  issued  the  general  standard  specifications  for  milled  rice  (a \nfirst  tranche  condition).  This  will  be  extended  to  10  varieties  of Cambodian  rice  as  a  second  tranche \ncondition. The capacities of MAFF and the Institute of Standards of Cambodia will  be enhanced to  ce1tify \nrice standards. \n\n17. \nWe recognize the importance of maintaining and  improving competitiveness  of Cambodian rice  in \nthe  international market.  To this end, the Government will  address sanitary and  phyto-sanita1y concerns by \nhaving  drafted  (a  first  tranche  condition)  the  Law  on  Plant  Protection  and  Phyto-sanitary  Measures  and \nsubmitting  the  draft  Law  to  the  National  Assembly  (a  second  tranche  condition).  On  a  related  matter, \nchemical  residues  from  the application of agricultural  chemicals to  growing crops  can  seriously affect the \nacceptance of produce from  such crops on  international  markets.  In  order to  maintain competitiveness and \nguard  against  such threats,  the Law on the Management of Pesticides  and  Fertilizers was  recently  adopted \n(a first tranche condition). \n\nWe believe implementation ofthe reform package and  investment subprojects under Rice-SDP will \n\n18. \ngo  a long way to realize objectives of the Government's Rice Policy. \n\n'.-:::::L,'sm!t~l'!m. on \n\nDeputy Prime Minister \nMinister of Economy and Finance \n\n4 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPOLICY MATRIX \n \n\nPolicy \ninitiative/objective \n\nPolicy Actions for the Release of the First Tranche \n\nPolicy Actions for the Release of the Second \nTranche \n\nOutput: A Conducive Legal and Regulatory Environment Established to Facilitate Rice Commercialization \n1.1.
