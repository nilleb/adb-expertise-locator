Outputs will be new transmission substations and high \nvoltage transmission  lines.  A  capacity  development  component  will  benefit  the  state\u2019s recently \nformed,  stand-alone  transmission  utility,  H.P.  Power  Transmission  Corporation  Limited \n(HPPTCL), and thus assist the state to achieve its power sector reform objectives, which include \nthe formation of an independent transmission utility.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\nBackground. Himachal Pradesh, a small mountainous state with a population of slightly \n3. \nover 6.8 million, has abundant water resources in the five major rivers flowing through the state \nfrom  the  western  Himalayas.  The  hydropower  generation  potential  of  Himachal  Pradesh  is \nabout  23,000  megawatts  (MW)\u2014about  one-fourth  of  the  total  hydropower  potential  of  India. \nPower generation capacity located within Himachal Pradesh consists solely of hydropower, with \nabout 6,256 MW of capacity installed as of December 2010. In its Hydropower Policy, 2006,3 the \nGovernment  of  Himachal  Pradesh  (GOHP)  targets  its  comparative  advantage  in  hydropower \nwith the goal  to  become  the  \u2015hydropower  state\u2016 of the  country. This  development  will  not  only \nbenefit  Himachal  Pradesh,  but  will  provide  a  clean  indigenous  source  of  energy  to  assist  in \nmeeting the country\u2019s rapidly increasing energy demand resulting from its high economic growth \nand aim to provide electricity for all its citizens. \n \nSector road map and investment program. The state\u2019s power sector road map covers \n4. \npower generation, transmission and distribution, regulatory matters, and capacity building. The \nroad  map\u2019s  emphasis  is  to  encourage  investment  in  hydropower  generation\u2014the  majority  of \nwhich  are  run-of-river  type\u2014and  articulates  that  Himachal  Pradesh  must  build  out  its  electric \ntransmission infrastructure so that the additional hydropower can be efficiently transmitted within \nand  outside  the  state.  As  Himachal  Pradesh  is  one  of  the  few  states  in  India  with  100% \nelectrification  at  the  village  level,  additional  hydropower  capacity  will  not  just  serve  the  state\u2019s \ngrowing demand, but will serve the national grid through interstate power flows.  As a subset of \nthe  overall  sector  road  map,  and  with  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nHPPTCL  has  prepared  a  power  system  master  plan  to  articulate  a  transmission  network \nexpansion  plan  for  Himachal  Pradesh.  4  This  plan,  endorsed  by  India\u2019s  Central  Electricity \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Project preparatory TA for the investment program was provided.

Hydro Power Policy, 2006. Shimla. \n4  ADB.  2010.  Capacity  Building  -  Power  Sector  Agencies  -  A  Power  System  Master  Plan  for  Himachal  Pradesh. \nManila\u2014funded  under  a  component  of  ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Capacity  Building  for \nHimachal Pradesh Power Sector Agencies. Manila (TA 7181-IND). \n\n\finvestment  program\u2019s \n\ntransmission  capacity  additions  support \n\nAuthority  (CEA),  provides  a  sound  basis  for  investment  in  transmission  facilities,  and  is \nexpected to engender confidence among existing and potential private hydropower developers \nthat  sufficient  transmission  capacity  will  be  available  to  evacuate  power  from  hydropower \nfacilities  to  markets  outside  of  Himachal  Pradesh.  The  investment  program  thus  consists  of \ntransmission system investments required through 2016, and a capacity development program \nfor  HPPTCL  to  help  corporatize  the  state  transmission  utility  as  a  stand-alone  entity\u2014a \nrequirement of the Electricity Act, 2003. \n \nStrategic  context.  The  road  map  and  investment  program  are  consistent  with  the \n5. \ndevelopment  goals  and  strategies  of  the  Government  of  India  and  ADB.  The  government\u2019s \nEleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012, includes increased infrastructure investment as a key for \npromoting  broad-based  economic  growth,  and  advocates  expanded  use  of  renewable  energy \nresources  to  increase  energy  security  and  improve  energy  efficiency  in  the  economy.  ADB\u2019s \nEnergy  Policy5 includes  increasing  energy  security  needs  and  facilitating  a  transition  to  low \ncarbon economies by promoting increased renewable energy in the region\u2019s energy mix.  Since \nthe \nfurther  hydropower \ndevelopment in Himachal Pradesh, the investment program indirectly contributes to a reduction \nin the carbon intensity of India\u2019s power supply mix. The road map and investment program are \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132012, which supports expanded \nand optimized transmission systems and institutional strengthening.6 \n \n6. \nPolicy framework. The Integrated Energy Policy, 2006 advocates optimizing the power \nsupply  mix,  including  greater  use  of  indigenous hydropower  resources  and  renewable energy. \nPolicies  specifically  related  to  hydropower  promotion  include  the  50,000  MW  Hydropower \nInitiative,  2003  and  the  New  Hydro  Policy,  2008.  At  the  state  level,  the  GOHP\u2019s  Hydropower \nPolicy,  2006  targets  the  hydropower  resources  in  the  state  and  promotes  hydropower  project \ndevelopment and its enabling infrastructure, including the transmission system. \n \nThe Electricity Act, 2003 is the cornerstone legislation for the power sector in India, and \n7. \nrequires  integrated  utility  companies  to  unbundle  into  separate  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  entities.  In  2006,  the  GOHP  formed  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation \nLimited as the state\u2019s generating company, and in 2008 formed the HPPTCL as a stand-alone \ntransmission utility company. The old Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board  has become a \ncorporation  and  will  serve  as  the  state\u2019s  distribution  utility.  While  this  process  has  been \nprogressing since 2006, the legal order issued on 10 June 2010 formally recognized HPPTCL \nas  the  state  transmission  utility.  The  state  also  has  an  independent  regulator  since  2000, \nHimachal  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (HPERC),  which  determines  tariffs  and \nregulates these new entities in accordance with regulatory guidelines from the Central Electricity \nRegulatory Commission. \n \nRationale  for  ADB  partnership  and  multitranche  financing  facility.  The  MFF \n8. \nsupports a well-defined investment program underpinned by continued institutional reform and a \ndelineated  sector  road  map.  The  state\u2019s  investment  program  objectives  require  a  flexible \nmodality  that  allows  financing  of  individual  investments  as  projects  and conditions  warrant,  by \nlinking financing to project readiness and capacity. The MFF is a suitable modality as it provides \nup-front  support  to  the  GOHP  for  its  substantial  development  program,  but  with  financial \ncommitments  sequenced  to  match  project  readiness.  As  the  sequenced  investments  are \nimplemented, expertise will build over time and will allow future projects to benefit directly from \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nimplementation  experience  gained  from  the  initial  investments  and  from  the  capacity \ndevelopment  component.  It  also  allows  ADB  to  engage  with  the  GOHP  in  a  continuous  long-\nterm dialogue consistent with the clean energy policies of the Government of India and ADB. \n \nLessons.  A  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  on  the  energy  sector  in  India, \n9. \nconducted in 2007, identifies lessons learned from previous ADB assistance.7 Lessons identified \ninclude (i) ADB\u2019s approach to lending at the state level has worked well and should be used as \na  model  for  future  assistance,  (ii)  sustained  TA  is  needed  to  support  state-level  sector  goals, \nand (iii) corporatization is providing benefits similar to those normally attributed to privatization \nby  introducing  commercially  and  financially  sustainable  principles  and  better  governance  into \nstate  entities.  These  experiences  are  reflected  in  the  design  and  preparation  of  the  proposed \nMFF, including TA and capacity development for the state transmission utility. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  investment  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  that  the  Himachal  Pradesh  power  sector \ntransmits clean energy to end users in Himachal Pradesh and the rest of India. The outcome will \nbe  that  HPPTCL  has  sufficient  assets  and  capacity  to  support  its  mandate  as  the  state \ntransmission utility company. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe investment program\u2019s outputs will include two major areas: (i) physical investments \nin  transmission  infrastructure,  including  high  voltage  lines  and  transmission  substations; 8 and \n(ii) capacity development for the state transmission utility company. The additional transmission \ncapacity to be added by this investment program is sufficient to transmit power to electrify  over \n456,000  homes  in  India,  and  includes  about  125  kilometers  of  transmission  lines  and  over \n12,000  MW  of  additional  substation  capacity.  Specifically,  the  first  project  of  the  investment \nprogram will fund the four investment components shown below. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n66/220/400 kilovolts (kV) gas insulated switchgear (GIS) substation at Wangtoo, \nDistrict Kinnaur; \n220/400 kV GIS substation near Pragati Nagar, District Shimla; \n66/220 kV GIS substation at Bhoktoo, District Kinnaur; and \na  transmission  line  of  about  28  kilometers  (220  kV  double  circuit  line)  from \nHatkoti to Pragati Nagar, District Shimla. \n\nto \n\nFuture \n\ntranches  are  expected \n\ninclude  nine  additional  substations  and \n\n \n12. \nfour \ntransmission lines. Substations include (i) 132/220 kV pooling station at Naggar, (ii) 33/220 kV \npooling station at Lahal, (iii) 66/22 kV pooling station at Kilba, (vi) 132/220 kV pooling station at \nSunda,  (v)  220  kV  switching  station  at  Hatkoti,  (vi)  220/400  kV  pooling  station  at  Lahal,  (vii) \n132/220 kV pooling station at Koti, (viii) 33/220 kV pooling station at Naggar, and (ix) 33/132 KV \nsubstation at Pandoh. Transmission lines include (i) 220 kV line from Sunda to Hatkoti, (ii)  400 \nkV  line  from  Lahal  to  Chamera,  (iii)  220  kV  line  from  Koti  to  Koria,  and  (iv)  220  kV  line  from \nNaggar to Banala. \n \n\n                                                \n7 ADB.  2007.

It will \nalso  fund  a  computerized  enterprise  resource  planning  solution  covering  accounting  and \nmanagement  information  system  applications;  and  will  finance  the  purchase  of  software, \nhardware, training, and initial system maintenance. \n \nD. \n \nThe  GOHP\u2019s  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  about  $438  million.  The \n14. \nGovernment  of  India  has  requested  an  MFF  in  an  amount  up  to  $350  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance part of the investment program. The MFF is expected \nto have three tranches, with tranche 1 ($113 million) scheduled for 2011, and two more tranches \nestimated  at  $80  million  and  $157  million  each  for  2012  through  2014,  subject  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  the  related  loan \nand  project  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and \nundertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. Individual loans will include taxes \nand  duties  for  the  investment  components,9 as  well  as  imbedded  costs  in  supply  and  erection \ncontracts such as transport (including local transport), freight, and insurance costs. The central \ngovernment  will  make  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  in  each  tranche  available  to  the  state \ngovernment, which will relend the proceeds to HPPTCL, in each case on terms and conditions \nconsistent with Indian legislation and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n\n \nMFF \n \n\nAmount \n \n \n\n \n \nItem \n \nBase Costa \nA. \n \n1.

For  these  purposes,  HPPTCL  has  established  a  project \nmanagement unit located at HPPTCL\u2019s headquarters in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. The project \nmanagement unit is headed by a project director, and includes staff located at headquarters and \nin the field at project sites. As HPPTCL was established in 2008 as part of the unbundling of the \nformer  state  integrated  utility  company  (Himachal  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board),  HPPTCL \nretains  staff  and  considerable  transmission  system  planning  and  operational  experience  from \nthe  Himachal  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board,  and  currently  has  130  employees.

The TA is attached to the \nloan  and  will  support  HPPTCL  in  the  preparation  of  future  subprojects  under  the  investment \nprogram, provide technical support, and assist in project implementation.12 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n19. \nAll investment projects under the investment program will be subject to rigorous scrutiny, \nas they are first examined by HPPTCL and then by the CEA for their technical, economic, and \nfinancial  feasibility.  ADB  will  also  review  all  aspects,  including  visiting  sites,  reviewing  all \navailable  reports,  and  undertaking  a  comprehensive  due  diligence  assessment,  including \nsafeguard aspects, and technical, financial, and economic viability. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20. \nAll proposed transmission system components within the investment program are part of \nthe power system master plan (footnote 4), which was endorsed by the CEA. This plan included \nseveral  interrelated  elements,  including  forecasting  power  demand  growth,  distribution  system \nplanning, formulating the generation expansion plan, the river basin plan, and the transmission \nsystem expansion plan. The design of the electricity infrastructure considered the security and \nreliability of the electricity supply via the transmission system, and involved a long-term view in \ndetermining least-cost options for optimizing the system. \n \nADB  has  reviewed  and  confirmed  the  technical  viability  of  the  tranche  1  loan \n21. \ninvestments. Project designs are consistent with overall least-cost expansion plans; and reflect \nbest-practice design, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) features. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  principles set  by  HPERC  as  the  regulatory  agency  define  the \nbasis  on  which  revenue  will  be  generated  from  transmission  assets.  The  transmission  tariff \npricing  regime  (the  aggregate  revenue  requirement  or  \u2015aggregate  revenue  requirement\u2016 \napproach)  transfers  all  but  operational  risk  away  from  the  transmission  licensee  (HPPTCL)  by \nensuring  that  costs  are  recovered  against  approved  investments  and  that  investments  earn  a \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2011\u20132013.

Volume  risk  is  borne  by  transmission  customers  (i.e.,  distribution \nlicensees  and  ultimately  end-use  customers  at  the  state  level).  The  aggregate  revenue \nrequirement, which will be confirmed by HPERC, will recover the full cost of loan capital by way \nof  accelerated  depreciation  (to  cover  the  bulk  of  principal  repayments  over  12  years)  and \ninterest, return on equity, O&M expenses, and interest on working capital. \n \n23. \nFinancial  analysis  of  all  tranches  under  the  investment  program  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.13 Financial viability will \nbe  examined  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  \u2015with-investment\u2016  and \n\u2015without-investment\u2016  scenarios.  Cost  streams  used  for  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR) \ndetermination  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated  benefits,  and  include  capital \ninvestment,  income  tax,  and  O&M.  Benefits  flow  to  HPPTCL  through  revenue  accruing  from \ntariffs earned from transmission of electricity through the transmission assets. The investment\u2019s \nFIRR will be compared to the weighted average cost of capital of the proposed investments to \nHPPTCL. Sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying assumptions will also \nbe assessed. For the tranche 1 project, the FIRR of 6% exceeded the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 4.3%, so the tranche 1 investments are deemed financially viable.14 \n \n24. \nEconomic analysis. Projects financed by the investment program, as part of the state\u2019s \npower  system  master  plan,  are  integral  components  of  the  least-cost  plan  to  achieve  desired \nlong-term  outcomes  for  power  system  expansion  in  Himachal  Pradesh.  A  time-slice  approach \nwas adopted for detailed economic cost\u2013benefit analysis, considering the entire power system \nmaster  plan\u2019s  generation  and  transmission  investment  plans,  2012\u20132016.  This  was  done  to \navoid  the  difficulties  inherent  in  allocating  costs  and  particularly  benefits  to  individual \ntransmission components in an increasingly interconnected network. \n \n25. \nElectricity  generated  and  transmitted  from  hydropower  assets  built  under  the  master \nplan  will  be  used  to  meet  any  unserved  demand  for  electricity  in  Himachal  Pradesh  and  the \nnorthern  region  of  the  national  grid.  When  there  is  no  unserved  demand,  this  electricity  will \ndisplace more expensive sources of generation in the northern region\u2014primarily diesel captive \nplants and coal-fired plants. Non-incremental outputs from the investment program are valued at \nthe  resource  cost  savings  that  would  accrue  if  the  investment  plan  proceeds.  Incremental \noutputs  are  valued  using  Himachal  Pradesh  and  northern  region  consumers\u2019  estimated \nwillingness  to  pay  for  incremental  consumption,  adjusted  for  medium  voltage  and  low  voltage \nlosses as appropriate. The basis for economic evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs \nbetween  the  with-  and  without-investment  scenarios.  Investment  is  assumed  to  take  place \nduring  2012\u20132016,  and  benefits  are  assumed  to  be  realized  progressively  from  2013.  The \ndetailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show that the overall investment master plan is economically \nviable,  with an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  24.9%. This  robust return  reflects \nthe high economic value of hydropower in India.15 \n \nC. \n \n26. \nA  governance  assessment  of  HPPTCL \nprocurement activities, and anticorruption measures. \n \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nincluded  public \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2005.

The  financial  management  assessment  evaluated \n27. \nHPPTCL\u2019s  ability  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  investment  program.  The \nassessment  was  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects \nusing  the  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  and  field  interviews.  HPPTCL \naccounts  are  audited  by  the  comptroller  and  auditor  general  of  India,  the  supreme  audit \nauthority in India. In addition, HPPTCL has engaged a chartered accounting firm as an internal \nauditor  since  2009.  The  accounts  personnel  are  familiar  with  accounting  and  different  control \naspects  in  power  sector  financial  management.  HPPTCL\u2019s  present  accounting  system  in  the \ncorporate office is a computerized commercial accounting package. However, as the company \ngrows,  further  computerization  will  be  required.  The  tranche  1  loan  will  fund  a  computerized \naccounting  management  information  system  that  will  meet  HPPTCL\u2019s  increasing  corporate \naccounting  and  financial  reporting  requirements  as  well  as  the  project  level  accounting  and \nreporting  requirements  under  the  investment  program.  Staff  will  be  trained  in  the  new \ncomputerized  accounting  systems;  corporate  accounting  procedures;  and  in  all  appropriate \naccounting,  reporting,  and  audit  functions.  Furthermore,  HPPTCL  staff  have  participated  in \nADB-sponsored loan disbursement seminars. As a consequence of the existing capacity, hiring \nplans, recommended training, and proposed upgrading and computerisation of accounting and \nmanagement  information  systems,  the  project  financial  management  arrangements  are \nconsidered satisfactory. \n \nProcurement. HPPTCL has a procurement unit with a full-time staff of eight personnel, \n28. \nheaded  by  a  procurement  professional  with  20  years  of  procurement  experience.  Its  tender \ncommittee,  which  will  evaluate  bids  and  make  recommendations  for  award,  consists  of  one \nrepresentative  each from  (i)  the  Contract  Services  Department;  (ii)  the  Materials  Management \nthe  Finance \nServices,  Engineering,  Erection,  and  Construction  Department;  and  (iii) \nDepartment. Proper record-keeping procedures are in place, and HPPTCL\u2019s board of directors \ngrants  final  approval  of  all  procurement  transactions.  HPPTCL  staff  have  participated  in  ADB-\nsponsored procurement seminars, and ADB provided support to HPPTCL in preparing bidding \ndocuments in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  HPPTCL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM (footnote 10). \n \nD. \n \n30. \nAdequate  power  supply  is  essential  to  sustain  economic  growth,  and  regular  and \nefficient power supply is correlated to poverty reduction. Indian states like Gujarat, Haryana, and \nPunjab,  with high  levels  of  power generation  and  consumption,  also  have lower  poverty  rates. \nThe benefits of improving the power sector are manifold. Technical developments and reforms \nthat lead to sector sustainability can free up resources for other pro-poor initiatives. Greater and \nmore reliable power supply helps bolster social services, as hospitals, schools, and other social \nentities  often  suffer  most  from  low-quality  power  supply  and  load  shedding.  Socially,  efficient \npower  supply  increases  access  to  electronic  media  such  as  television  and  radio,  allowing  a \ngreater understanding of civic affairs and better informed choices. For the economy of India, a \ndeveloped  power  sector  boosts  farm  mechanization  and  agricultural  yield,  and  benefits  the \ncommercial  and  industrial  sectors  through  business  expansion  and  more  employment \nopportunities. With regular electrification, household and cottage industries would also increase \nand improve. During construction, the investment program is expected to generate employment \nin Himachal Pradesh of both skilled and unskilled labor, which can include women workers. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n31. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  a  resettlement  framework,  and \nindigenous peoples planning framework outline the governing environment and social safeguard \nprinciples and requirements for the projects financed by the investment program.16 HPPTCL will \nundertake  environmental  and  social  safeguard  due  diligence  on  all  projects  based  on  these \nframeworks and submit annual reports on implementation of environmental management plans \n(EMPs) and resettlement plans for projects, and if required, indigenous peoples plans. HPPTCL \nhas  its  own  board-approved  safeguards  policies:  (i)  the  Environment  and  Social  Safeguards \nPolicy; and (ii) the Resettlement, Relief, Rehabilitation and Compensation Policy. These policies \nwere taken into consideration in preparing the environmental assessment and review framework \nand resettlement framework. \n \n32. \nThe tranche 1 project is environment category B. The civil construction work is limited to \nbuilding  foundations  for  the  transmission  towers,  and  substations,  and  the  tranche  1  project \ndoes  not  come  within  any  environmentally  sensitive  area.  Based  on  the  environmental \nassessment and surveys, associated potential adverse environmental impacts are minimal and \ncan  be mitigated through  implementation  of the EMP.  An adequate  budgetary  provision  in the \ntranche  1  project  covers  the  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  requirements,  and  the \nEMP is part of the construction contracts. HPPTCL will supervise the construction contracts and \nEMP  implementation,  and  semiannual  progress reports  of  its  implementation  will  be  submitted \nto  ADB.  Overall,  the  major  social  and  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  tranche  1 \nproject  are  limited  to  the  construction  period  and  can  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level  by \nimplementation  of  recommended  engineering  measures  and  environmental  practices.  Future \ntranches are expected to be environment category B based on investigations conducted to date, \nwhich will be confirmed during detailed due diligence conducted for each tranche. \n \n33. \nThe  tranche  1  project  is  involuntary  resettlement  category  B  and  indigenous  peoples \ncategory  C.  Census  surveys  and  consultations  were  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Indicative  and  expected  categorization  for  all  future \ntranches  is  involuntary  resettlement  category  B  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C  based  on \nsubproject reviews to date, which will be confirmed during investment program implementation. \nThe  tranche  1  project  will  entail  minimum  private  land  acquisition.  Of  the  three  proposed \nsubstations,  two  are  to  be  built  on  government  land,  and  the  third  requires  2.5  hectares  of \nprivate  land.  The  transmission  line  will  have  76 towers,  out  of  which  63  will  be  located  on \nprivately  owned  land,  10  towers  will  be  placed  on  government  land,  and  the  remaining  three \ntowers  will  be  placed  on  community  land.  No  structures  or  buildings  will  be  affected  and  no \nphysical displacement is foreseen. In total, the tranche 1 project includes the acquisition of 3.65 \nhectares  of  private  land.  Regarding  gender  issues,  the  loan  agreements  include  a  standard \nassurance related to core labor standards for contractors (including equal pay for equal type of \nwork), and an awareness program on HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.17 \n \nF. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The risks are manageable and appropriate \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n16 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17 Resettlement Plan: Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nmitigation measures are incorporated in the investment program design. Overall, the integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDelays in completion of hydropower \nprojects could cause some \ninvestment program transmission \nfacilities to sit idle, not earning \nrevenue, until the generating facilities \nare completed. \n\nMitigating Measures \nHydropower projects take 4\u20135 years to construct, while transmission assets \ntake 12\u201318 months to construct, such that transmission asset construction \nonly starts once hydropower projects are in advanced construction. The \ntiming of the transmission construction under this investment program is \nsequenced to match the schedules of known hydropower projects in \nadvanced construction. The investment program\u2019s projects are thus \nrequired as soon as possible to meet known systemic needs. In addition, \nminimal expenses are associated with such temporarily idle facilities \n\nWeather-related construction delays \ncould occur due to some system \ninvestments located at high altitudes \nwhere work is not possible during the \nwinter because of excessive snow. \n\nTiming of contract awards is sequenced to take into account the constraints \ncaused by the winter months. This is a common issue in the Himachal \nPradesh power sector and HPPTCL engineers have worked around this \nconstraint for their entire careers. \n \n\nLand acquisition for transmission \ntowers could cause delays. \n\nDelays in project administration could \nbe caused by lack of enough \nHPPTCL staff.  \n\nHPPTCL has sufficient personnel on the ground at the subproject sites to \ncarry out this work, and actual land requirements are minimal. \n \nLoan covenants require the hiring of key financial management and other \npersonnel by specified dates. Capacity development loan funds as well as \nattached TA funds provide consulting services to support HPPTCL. \n \n\nHPPCL = imachal Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n35. \nThe government and HPPTCL have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram  shall  conform  to all  applicable  ADB  policies  including those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \nThe government and HPPTCL have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which \n36. \nare  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.
