The  project  will  expand  on  infrastructure  development  being  undertaken  in \nNuku\u2019alofa \nIntegrated  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Project.2 \n \n\nthe  Nuku\u2019alofa  Reconstruction  Project  and \n\nthrough \n\nthe \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nUrban  growth.  Nuku\u2019alofa,  Tonga\u2019s  capital,  has  a  population  of  34,058  (34%  of  the \n3. \nnational population) and is forecast to grow to 45,000 (or about 40% of Tonga's population) by \n2030. Migration to Nuku\u2019alofa from Tonga\u2019s outer islands is significant. Urban growth in Tonga \nhas  not  been  matched  by  the  provision  of,  or  improvement  in  the  delivery  of,  urban  services. \nLiving  conditions  for  many  Nuku\u2019alofa  residents  are  deteriorating,  and  demand  for  improved \nurban infrastructure is increasing. \n \n4. \nDevelopment pressure in Nuku\u2019alofa is increasing as a result of population growth. The \nexisting  urban  infrastructure  is  already  insufficient  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  current  urban \npopulation.  Upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure  is  being  undertaken  through  the  Nuku\u2019alofa \nReconstruction  Project  and  the  Integrated  Urban  Development  Sector  Project.  However,  the \nscope  of  these  projects  is  limited  and  they  will  not  meet  all  immediate  infrastructure  needs. \nFurther investment in urban infrastructure is required. Land for urban expansion of Nuku\u2019alofa is \nlimited to peripheral agricultural and ecologically sensitive areas. \n \n5. \nGovernment policy and strategy. The Government of Tonga\u2019s development aims and \nprogram  are  presented  in  the  Tonga  Strategic  Development  Framework  (TSDF).3 The  TSDF \nspecifically  targets  infrastructure  and  has  four  priority  themes  for  economic  infrastructure: \n(i) renewable energy and stable electricity prices, (ii) improved access to markets, (iii) improved \nmanagement  of  the  water  and  waste  cycle,  and  (iv)  improved  asset  management.  ADB\u2019s \nCountry  Partnership  Strategy,  Tonga,  2007\u201320124 supports  implementation  of  the  TSDF.  The \ndraft  National  Spatial  Planning  and  Management  Act  2011  (NSPM)  pending  in  the  legislature, \nwhen  enacted,  will  provide  the  framework  for  land  use  planning  and  development.  Urban \nplanning  objectives  articulated  in  the  NSPM  include  the  creation  of  an  urban  structure  with \nequitable  access  to  employment,  transportation,  recreational  and  other  opportunities,  and  to \nprotect  public  utilities  and  other  assets  and  enable  the  orderly  provision  and  coordination  of \npublic utilities and other facilities for the benefit of the community. \n \nThe  government  has  prepared  costed  and  prioritized  infrastructure  development  plans \n6. \nfor  Tonga,  the  Tonga  National  Infrastructure  Investment  Plan  (TNIIP),  and  for  Nuku\u2019alofa,  the \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Nuku\u2019alofa  Reconstruction  Project  is  funded  through  a  CNY440  million  loan  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina and was approved in 2007. The Integrated Urban Development Sector Project was approved by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in March 2008. (ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Asian Development Fund Grant, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga \nfor the Integrated Urban Development Sector Project. Manila .) \n\n3  Government of Tonga. 2011. Tonga Strategic Development Framework 2011\u20132014. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n4  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: Tonga, 2007\u20132012. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nin \n\nterm \n\nthe  short \n\nfor  Nuku\u2019alofa \n\nUrban  Infrastructure  Development  Plan  (UIDP).  The  UIDP  will  guide  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment \n(FY2011 FY2013),  medium-term \n(FY2014 FY2016),  and  long-term  (FY2017 FY2031).  The  infrastructure  investments  identified \nin the UIDP are generally aligned with urban infrastructure investments identified in the TNIIP. \n \n7. \nFurther  assistance  is  required  to  improve  planning  and  the  sustainability  of  urban \nservices. The Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA) of the Ministry of Transport will \nbe responsible for implementing the NSPM. Capacity development will be required within PUMA \nto  implement  and  enforce  the  NSPM  and  to  establish  the  National  Spatial  Planning  Authority \nadvisory committee. The policies for water supply and solid waste services tariffs are obsolete \nand  require  amendment  to  enable  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance (O&M)  costs  in  the \nshort term  and full  cost recovery  of O&M,  depreciation,  and financing  costs  in the  medium- to \nlong-term. Planned and preventative maintenance for urban infrastructure are neither prepared \nnor implemented, with the exception of Tonga Power Limited, resulting in the rapid dilapidation \nof urban assets. \n \nWater supply.  About 98% of households in Nuku\u2019alofa have access to the piped water \n8. \nsupply  provided  by  Tonga  Water  Board  (TWB),  a  state-owned  enterprise.  Water  for  the  TWB \nwater  supply  is  pumped  from  the  Mataki\u2019eua  Tongamai  well  field  and  is  chlorinated  prior  to \ndistribution. Currently, only 32 of the 40 production wells are operating. Water quality monitoring \ndata  indicate  increasing  salinity  of  the  Mataki\u2019eua  Tongamai  acquifer,  particularly  in  the  wells \nclosest  to  Faga\u2019uta  Lagoon.  The  construction  of  additional  production  wells  to  the  west  of  the \nexisting  wells  will  reduce  the  risk  of  further  saline  intrusion.  Diesel-powered  pumps  at  the \nwellfield are a source of soil contamination and potential water contamination and have higher \nO&M costs than electric pumps. \n \n9. \nNonrevenue  water  (NRW)  in  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  water  supply  network  is  estimated  to  be \n30%\u201350%.  Unmetered  usage  from  fire  hydrants  and  leakage  from  consumer  service \nconnections  are  considered  to  be  substantial.  Current  average  daily  production,  estimated  at \n7,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  day,  is  inadequate  to  meet  demand  and  the  system  losses. \nDemand is projected to increase from the current level of 4,800 m3 per day to 6,600 m3 per day \nby  2016.  Reduction  of  NRW  is  essential  to  reduce  the  required  production  rates  at  the \nMataki\u2019eua Tongamai well field and water production costs. \n \n10. \nThe  financial  performance  of  TWB  has  steadily  improved  since  FY2008,  with  the \noperating  loss  falling  from  T$820,000  in  FY2008  to  T$167,000  in  FY2010.  This  trend  is \nexpected  to  continue  in  FY2011.  Preliminary  results  for  the  year  to  date  in  March  FY2011 \nindicate an operating surplus of T$1.1 million. This improvement is attributed to increased water \nrevenue, which grew by 35%, and improved bill  collection, which increased from 88% to 94%. \nTotal  operating  costs  during  the  same  period  increased  by  16%.  TWB  charges  its  customers \nT$2.97  per  1,000  liters.  TWB  does  not  receive  subsidies  from  the  government  and  relies  on \nexternal grants to finance capital works. \n \n11. \nSanitation.  Most  households  in  Nuku\u2019alofa  rely  on  individual  septic  tank  systems  for \nwastewater disposal. Many septic tanks are undersized, improperly constructed, and maintained \nonly  when  full  or  overflowing.  Septic  tanks  are  the  main  source  of  contaminants  in  aquifers \nwithin  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  area.  Contaminated  groundwater  discharging  to  the  coastal  fringe  and \nlagoon  areas  causes  excessive  algal  growth,  and  there  are  concerns  about  impacts  on  the \naquatic  ecosystems.  Monitoring  wells  to  assess  groundwater  quality  have  been  constructed, \nand a water quality monitoring program commenced in June 2010. \n \nSolid  waste  management.  In  2007,  a  new  landfill  was  commissioned  at  Tapuhia;  a \n12. \nhousehold  solid  waste  collection  system  was  implemented  on  Tongatapu;  and  the  Waste \n \n\n\f3 \n\nAuthority Limited (WAL) was established to take control of solid waste collection and disposal. \nThis  includes responsibility  for  disposal  of  septage  at the Tapuhia facility.  The  performance of \nWAL  over  the  past  3  years  has  been  poor.  In  particular,  billing  and  revenue  collection  are \nineffective.  The  replacement  of  the  WAL  board  and  chief  executive  officer  in  May  2011  is \nexpected  to  result  in  improved  management.  The  revenue  collection  rate  for  solid  waste \ncharges is about 27% of billings. A revenue collection rate of about 70% is required, based on \ncurrent  solid  waste  charges,  for  recovery  of  O&M  costs.  WAL  is  not  financially  viable,  and \ndespite  a  maintenance  fund  provided  by  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  is \nunable to fund adequate maintenance and repairs, and has a growing maintenance backlog that \nplaces  the  provision  of  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal  services  at  risk.  Capacity \ndevelopment within WAL is urgently required to (i) provide robust financial management and for \ntariff  setting,  billing,  revenue  collection,  and  accounting;  (ii) provide  a  sustainable  asset \nmanagement  system,  including  the  preparation  of  a  5-year  asset  management  plan;  and  (iii) \nstrengthen governance and management. \n \n13. \nRoads.  Traffic  growth  in  Nuku\u2019alofa  has  resulted  in  congestion  of  the  main  approach \nroads to the  urban  area and  roads  in the town  center.  Limited traffic  management  at  strategic \nlocations,  particularly  regarding  parking,  contributes  to  traffic  congestion.  The  absence  of \nadequate road drainage and the poor maintenance of existing drains result in frequent flooding \nof  roads.  The  surfaces  of  most  local  residential  access  roads  are  gravel,  and  they  are \nimpassable  during  wet  weather.  Limited  provisions  for  pedestrians  (i.e.,  footpaths)  result  in \npedestrian\u2013vehicular  traffic  conflicts,  particularly  after  heavy  rainfall,  when  roadside  flooding \nforces pedestrians onto the main roadways. \n \nDrainage. Tongatapu is flat and low-lying, the highest elevation being 70 meters above \n14. \nsea  level.  Most  of  the  urban  area  of  Nuku\u2019alofa  is  only  1\u20132  meters  above  sea  level  and  is \nsubject  to  periodic  flooding  during  heavy  rain.  Most  floodwater  eventually  infiltrates  into  the \nlimestone substrata, but extensive low-lying areas within the urban area are frequently flooded \nand  provide  ideal  conditions  for  mosquitoes  and  transmission  of  waterborne  diseases. \nDevelopment  of  residential  subdivisions  on  the  fringes  of  Nuku\u2019alofa  is  constrained  by  large \nareas of undrained surface water, requiring substantial filling of properties and raising of roads. \nThe  piecemeal  raising  of  road  levels  and  filling  of  properties  has  altered  the  natural  drainage \npatterns,  and  created  additional  swamps  and  open  water  bodies,  resulting  in  flood  damage  to \nproperty and a loss of access to unfilled properties. \n \n15. \nAsset  management.  Management  of  existing  and  new  urban  infrastructure  is  a  high \npriority.  Government  policy  specifies  that  the  cost  of  O&M  of  economic  infrastructure  must  be \nfunded from user charges. The government intends to work closely with public enterprises, the \nprivate  sector,  and  development  partners  to  lift  the  overall  performance  of  the  economic \ninfrastructure  sector,  and,  as  a  minimum,  to  achieve  self-funding  of  sustainable  O&M  by  the \ngovernment and public enterprises. \n \n16. \nSector  financing.  The  project  meets  the  criteria  for  sector  financing  as  (i)  the \ngovernment  has  prepared  a  prioritized  and  costed  urban  sector  development  plan  for \nNuku\u2019alofa,  the  UIDP,  and  the  TNIIP;  (ii)  Tonga  is  implementing  the  Integrated  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Project (IUDSP)5, which has a sector loan modality, and has the capacity \nto  implement  both  the  UIDP  and  the  TNIIP;  and  (iii)  the  policies  for  development  of  Tonga\u2019s \nurban  sector  as  provided  in  the  IUDSP  are  appropriate,  are  supported  by  infrastructure \ndevelopment  polices  articulated  in  the  TNIIP  and  the  TSDP  and  will  undergo  further \nimprovement.  The  NSPM  will  provide  the  framework  for  planning  and  coordinating  urban \n                                                \n5   ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund  Grant,  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  for  the  Integrated  Urban  Development \nSector Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ndevelopment.6 The estimated investment cost to implement the UIDP is $186 million comprising \n$87.5  million  for  short-term  (high  priority)  investments,  $48.5  million  for  medium-term \ninvestments, and $50 million for long-term investments. The project will assist the government in \nimplementing the UIDP and the NSPM and to reform tariff and asset management policies for \nTWB  and  WAL.  Lessons  from  previous  relevant  ADB  and  development  partner  operations  in \nTonga have been incorporated in the project design. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe impact of the project is improved living conditions for the population of  Nuku\u2019alofa. \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  Nuku\u2019alofa  residents  have  access  to  improved  municipal \nservices. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nOutput  1:  Strengthened  policy  environment  for  delivery  of  urban  services.  The \nproject  will  strengthen  the  policy  environment  for  delivery  of  urban  services  in  Tonga  by \n(i) building  capacity  within  PUMA  to  develop  urban  planning  and  management  policies  and  to \nimplement  the  NSPM  for  improved  planning  and  coordination  of  urban  services  and  urban \ninfrastructure development; (ii) reforming TWB and WAL tariffs for recovery of water supply and \nsolid  waste  services  O&M  costs,  and  (iii)  building  capacity  to  develop  and  implement  urban \ninfrastructure asset management plans. \n \n19. \nOutput 2: Effective, efficient, and sustainable water supply services in Nuku\u2019alofa. \nThe core subproject will (i) increase the water production at the Mataki\u2019eua Tongamai well field; \n(ii)  increase  the raw  water  storage  capacity;  (iii) improve the  management  of the  water  supply \nnetwork  through  the  creation  of  supply  zones  and  improved  bulk  supply  metering;  (iv)  reduce \nNRW from the current level, estimated at about 50%, to less than 25%; (v) develop consumer \nwater  meter  replacement  policies  and  replace  defective  consumer  meters;  and  (vi)  improve \nrevenue collection, billing, and financial management capacity. \n \n20. \nOutput  3:  Sustainable  solid waste  services  in  Nuku\u2019alofa. This core subproject will \nassist  WAL  to  improve  its  service  delivery  to  the  residents  of  Nuku\u2019alofa  by  improving  waste \ndisposal  operations  at  the  Tapuhia  landfill,  improving  and  expanding  solid  waste  collection \nservices, and strengthening financial management capacity in WAL. \n \nOutput  4:  Other  municipal  services  within  Nuku\u2019alofa  improved.  Other  municipal \n21. \nservices  will  be \nimplementation  of  selected  high-priority  urban \ninfrastructure  components  identified  in  the  UIDP  and  the  TNIPP  (candidate  subprojects), \nincluding  at  least  one  sanitation  subcomponent  such  as  a  sanitation  and  wastewater  master \nplan  for  Nuku\u2019alofa.  Candidate  subprojects  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  agreed \nselection  criteria  and  due  diligence  requirements  set  out  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual \n(PAM) and will be approved by the project steering committee and ADB. \n \nOutput 5: Raised community awareness of municipal services. The project will raise \n22. \ncommunity  awareness  of  municipal  services  issues  including  planning  and  development \nconsent  requirements;  household  responsibilities  for  managing  solid  waste  (reduce,  recycle, \nreuse); and public health benefits of safe waste handling and disposal. The project will improve \ncustomer  complaints  mechanisms  in  the  TWB  and  WAL,  and  conduct  public  consultation  on \nservice  standards,  water  conservation,  and  demand  management.

The  financial  costs  of  the  core \nsubprojects  were  used,  including  the  recurrent  replacement  costs  of  capital  equipment  items, \nbut  excluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction. \nResettlement  and  consulting  costs  were  included  in  the  analysis.  The  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn for the water supply core subproject is 13%, and the financial internal rate of return for the \nsolid waste core subproject is 20%. \n \n28. \nEconomic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  water  supply  and  solid  waste  core \nsubprojects by comparing the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project \nscenarios  over  2012\u20132032  in  constant  2012  prices.  The  without-project  case  represents  a \ncontinuation  of  the  existing  situation,  and  the  with-project  case  represents  the  project \ninvestment  scenario.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  water  supply  core \nsubproject is estimated at 13%, slightly higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%) and the \nEIRR for the solid  waste  core  subproject  is  31%.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  undertaken  on  the \neconomic  results  to  examine  the  impacts  of  key  assumptions  and  project  risks  as  follows: \n(i) total costs increased by 10%, (ii) total revenue reduced by 10%, (iii) total costs increased by \n10%  and  total  revenue  reduced  by  10%,  and  (iv)  construction  period  lengthened  by  1  year. \nUnder these scenarios, the viability of the water supply core subproject falls, with EIRRs of 9%\u2013\n11%. 10 While  Tonga  is  not  a  fragile  state  per  se,  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach  considers  small \nisolated  Pacific  states,  including  Tonga,  as  fragile  and  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  fragile \nstates  apply  including  relaxation  of  expected  economic  rates  of  return.  The  solid  waste  core \nsubproject  remains  economically  viable  under  these  adverse  scenarios,  with  EIRR  values \nremaining well above the opportunity cost of capital, the lowest value being 24%. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nFinancial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nexecuting agency, the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP), will open an imprest \naccount  for  the  ADB  grant  and  an  imprest  account  for  the  Government  of  Australia  grant, \nimmediately  after  grant  effectiveness  to  be  used  exclusively  for  the  ADB  and  the  Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  shares  of  eligible  expenditures.  A  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) performance assessment conducted in 2010 concluded that Tonga\u2019s PFM \nsystem  is  based  on  a  solid  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  underpinned  by  a  set  of  well \nestablished expenditure control procedures covering wages and salaries, non-salary items and \nprocurement.  11  The  MFNP  is  administering  the  imprest  account  for  the  Integrated  Urban \nDevelopment  Sector  Project  (footnote  5)  using  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  with  a \nceiling  of  $100,000.  Annual  independent  audits  of  the  Integrated  Urban  Development  Sector \nProject  imprest  account  for  FY2009  and  FY2010  are  satisfactory  and  show  no  anomalies  in \nmanagement.  Statements  of  expenditure  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  and  verified  by  the \nMFNP. \n \n30. \nProcurement.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  MFNP  was  performed  and \nconcluded  that  Tonga\u2019s  procurement  regulations  and  procedures  are  comprehensive  and  that \nthe  MFNP  procurement  unit  is  functioning  well  but  has  limited  procurement  experience  and \nqualifications.12 Procurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ncontracts  for  works  will  be  awarded  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \n\n                                                \n10  ADB.  2007.

Project consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-based \nselection  procedures.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  assist  in  recruiting  the  project \nimplementation assistance consultants. ADB will assist by selecting the consultants on behalf of \nthe executing agency (MFNP). However, MFNP will be responsible for negotiating the contract \nwith the consultants and supervising their services. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n31. \nwith the government and MFNP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nA  social  survey  conducted  in  April  2011  concluded  that  communities  in  Nuku\u2019alofa \nidentify  the  poor  as  those  facing  hardship.  Lack  of  employment  and  other  income-earning \nopportunities  are  the  main  causes  of  hardship.  Other  causes  included  too  many  dependents, \nlandlessness,  the  burden  of  family,  community  obligations,  poor  health,  and  poor  family \nbudgeting.  Specific  groups  most  vulnerable  to  hardship  include  children,  youth,  women,  the \ndisabled, and the elderly. The project will address hardship by fostering equitable, reliable, and \nquality water and waste management services and other urban services. \n \n33. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective gender  mainstreaming,  with  the majority  of  project \noutputs  having  specific  gender  design  features  to  facilitate  and  ensure  women\u2019s  participation \nand  access  to  project  benefits.  Significant  concerns  of  women  in  Nuku\u2019alofa  include \n(i) affordability  of  urban  services,  (ii)  improving  water  and  power  usage  (conservation), \n(iii) improving the health and well-being of households and the community, (iv) greater access to \ninformation  on  urban  services  and  urban  planning,  (v)  greater  involvement  in  developing \nsolutions  for  communities  through  women\u2019s  committee  support,  and  (vi)  involvement  in \nconsultation  and  decision  making.  The  project  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  will  address  these \nconcerns  and  ensure  that  any  potential  harmful  effects  on  women  are  avoided.  The  GAP \nincludes specific actions that will allow women to benefit from the project.13 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  environmental  category  B.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  for  the  water  supply  and  solid  waste  subprojects  and  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009).14 The water supply core subproject provides a positive environmental \nbenefit  through  sustainable  water  resource  management.  The  solid  waste  core  subproject  will \nexpand  the  environmentally  safe  waste  disposal  capacity  of  the  Tapuhia  landfill,  and  will  re-\nimplement  and  deliver  more  effective  waste  collection  services  and  landfill  operations.  No \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  will  result  from  the  implementation  of  the  solid  waste  core \nsubproject. \n \n35. \nThe  EARF  will  guide  the  assessment  of  subsequent  subprojects.  PUMA  will  receive \nsupport  from  the  project  implementation  assistance  consultants  in  (i)  preparing  IEEs  for \nsubsequent  subprojects,  (ii)  monitoring  of  contractor  compliance  and  of  ongoing  impacts,  and \n(iii) reporting on environmental monitoring. The EARF includes a reporting outline to guide the \n                                                \n13 ADB  Guidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  projects.  http://www.adb.org/gender/gender-\n\ncategories.asp.

The  government  has  endorsed  the  IEEs  for  the \nwater supply and solid waste subprojects and the EARF. \n \n36. \nClimate  change.  A  climate  risk  profile  for  Tonga,  prepared  by  ADB  in  2008,  indicates \nthat the main impacts of climate change are expected to be high sea levels, extreme winds, and \nextreme  high  air  and  water  temperatures.  Best  estimates  of  long-term,  systematic  changes  in \nthe  average  climate  for  Tonga  indicate  that  sea  level  is  likely  to  have  increased  by  36 \ncentimeters  and  the  frequency  of  severe  short  sea  level  rise  resulting  from  storm  surge \n(2.2 meters above mean sea level) will increase from a one in 580-year event to a one in 5-year \nevent  by  2050.  The  project  will  provide  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  water  supply  with  greater  resilience  to \nclimate  change  through  the  development  of  water  supply  wells  located  further  from  Faga\u2019uta \nLagoon and less likely to be subject to saline intrusion as a consequence of sea level rise. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B.  A  resettlement \n37. \nframework  (RF)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  a \nresettlement plan (RP) was prepared for the water supply core subproject. The government has \nendorsed  the  RF  and  RP.  The  solid  waste  core  subproject  is  not  expected  to  require  land \nacquisition and a resettlement plan was not prepared for the subproject. The water supply core \nsubproject will involve the construction of 12 new wells requiring long-term leases of small plots \nof land from three households and one farming enterprise. There will be no temporary impacts \non private or public assets as a result of construction or new easements, as all additional works \nare  on  existing  rights-of-way.  A  total  of  19  people  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  for  the \nproject. However, no relocation of dwellings or other structures will be required.  No acquisition \namounts to more than 10% of a household\u2019s total land holding. Therefore, none of the impacts \nare considered significant. \n \n38. \nThe  solid  waste  core  subproject  consists  of  three  components:  (i)  upgrading  Tapuhia \nlandfill,  (ii)  a  pilot  community  waste  bin  project  in  five  peri-urban  villages,  and  (iii)  financial \nmanagement  and  accounting  support.  Components  1  and  3  have  no  land  acquisition \nrequirements or resettlement impacts. Component 2 will be implemented in select communities \nwhere  land  acquisition  for  community  waste  bins  is  not  required.  Selection  of  sites  for \ncomponent  2  activities  will  not  occur  until  project  implementation.  Additional  due  diligence  will \nthen  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  no  resettlement  impacts  result  from  component  2.  No \nconstruction  activities  under  component  2  will  be  undertaken  until  ADB  confirms  it  has  no \nobjection to the proposed sites.15 \n \n39. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  indigenous  peoples  as  category  C.  The \npeople in Tonga are Polynesian and consider themselves indigenous in terms of ethnic origin. \nThe project is not expected to have a negative impact on any distinct and vulnerable group of \nindigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  .  While  a  separate \nindigenous  peoples  plan  is  not  needed,  all  project  outputs  will  be  delivered  in  a  culturally \nappropriate and participatory manner to meet the needs of various beneficiaries. \n \n40. \ncapacity development within the executing and implementing agencies to manage safeguards. \n \nE. \n\nAll  safeguard  documents  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.
