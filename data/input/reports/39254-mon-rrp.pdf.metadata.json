The Project will support the \nGovernment  to  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  primary  and \nsecondary  education  with  a  view  to  shifting  to  a  12-year  education \nsystem.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  improving  education \nplanning,  management,  and  budgeting;  (ii)  strengthening  pre-service \nteacher  training  (PSTT);  (iii)  enhancing  the  quality,  affordability,  and \nlevels  of  provision  of  textbooks  and  other  teaching  and  learning \nmaterials, including enhanced innovation in the use of information and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  in  the  classroom;  and  (iv)  providing \nbetter  learning  conditions  by  upgrading  the  physical  infrastructure  of \nteacher training institutes (TTIs). \n \n \nProgress has been made in the education sector over the past decade, \npartly  as  a  result  of  effective  working  relationships  between  the \nGovernment and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the other key \ndevelopment  partners.  However,  support  is  still  needed  to  reform  and \ntransform the education system and to upgrade essential services and \nfacilities. ADB has supported the Government to move from an 11-year \nto  a  12-year  education  system,  which  will  align  Mongolia\u2019s  education \nsystem  with  international  standards.  Successful  implementation  of  this \npolicy  will  require  a  comprehensive  reform  of  the  PSTT,  reducing  the \ncost  and  improving  the  provision  of  textbooks,  streamlining  education \nfinance,  budgeting  and planning,  introducing  innovative  approaches  to \neducation  by  enhancing  the  use  of  ICT  for  education,  and  improving \nTTI facilities in support of comprehensive reforms in PSTT. The Project \nwill  support  the  Government  to  implement  this  policy  effectively  and \nefficiently and to ensure it is sustainable. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  quality,  access,  efficiency, \nand effectiveness of the 12-year education system. The outcome of the \nProject will be an effective 12-year education system. \n \n\nRecipient \n \nClassification \n\nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $10,830,000,  of  which \n$10,000,000  will  be  financed  from  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \ngrant  funds  and  $830,000  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  in  the \nform of taxes and duties. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Mongolia \n\nTotal \n10.00 \n 0.83 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n% \n92.34 \n7.66 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  10.83 \n\n   100.00 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund \nresources to finance 92.34% of the total project cost. \n\nUntil 30 September 2013 \n \nUntil 31 March 2013 \n\n \nMinistry of Education, Culture, and Science (MECS) \n \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the  state  secretary  of \nMECS, will include senior officials of the Ministry of Finance and MECS, \nand  project  aimag  representatives  will  provide  overall  guidance.  The \nPSC  will  provide  strategic  guidance,  monitor  implementation,  and \nensure  funding  agency  coordination.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  and \nwill be responsible for approving the annual project budget and activity \nplan  and  for  reviewing  and  advising  on  implementation  progress.  The \nProject will be implemented through the current project implementation \nunit  (PIU)  established  under  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram, Second Education Development Project, and Third Education \nDevelopment Project, staffed by a  project manager and five additional \nstaff, who will be responsible for the overall implementation of activities. \nThe  PIU  will  report  to  the  project  director  and  provide  quarterly  result-\nbased progress reports to the PSC, MECS management, and ADB.  \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nProcurement  of  civil  works  will  be  carried  out  through  national \ncompetitive  bidding.  Procurement  of  equipment  will  be  performed \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  and  national  competitive \nbidding satisfactory to ADB, and shopping. \n \nA total of 18 person-months of international consulting services and 150 \nperson-months of national consulting services will be contracted under \nthe  grant  funds.  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  have \nexpertise \nfinance,  management,  and  planning; \n(ii) textbook provision systems, cost reduction strategies, and textbook \n\nin  (i)  education \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nGrant Amount  \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\niii\n\npublishing  skills;  (iii)  development  and  implementation  of  national \nstrategies  for  ICT  in  education,  the  use  of  ICT  as  a  learning  and \nteaching  tool,  and  local  language  educational  software  development; \n(iv) all aspects of PSTT; and (v) monitoring and evaluation. Consultants \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nStudents  enrolled  in  primary  and  secondary  schools  will  be  direct \nbeneficiaries of the modernization of the education system. Nationwide, \nabout  540,000  students  and  their  parents  will  gain  from  the  improved \naffordability,  cost,  and  durability  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials. \nAbout  110,000  students  from  poor  families  will  benefit  from  better \ntargeting  of  free  textbook  provision  under  the  Project.  About  10,000 \nstudent  teachers  and  1,200  teacher  educators  throughout  the  country \nwill benefit from improvements to PSTT in five TTIs and from upgraded \nteaching  and  learning  facilities.  Graduates  of  these  TTIs  entering  the \nteaching  labor  force  will  be  able  to  improve  education  quality  and  to \nclose  the  urban\u2013rural  gap  in  education  achievement.  Students  and \ncommunities in rural areas will benefit from ICT centers of excellence. \nOther  specific  project  benefits  will  include:  increased  planning  and \nmanagement capacity of MECS and local education staff, leading to an \nimproved  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp);  and  better  planning  and \nimplementation of ICT investments. \n \nSuccessful implementation of the Project rests on the assumption that \nthe Government will (i) maintain a high level of budget allocation for the \neducation  sector;  (ii)  be  committed  to  improving  funding  agency \ncoordination  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the \ndelivery of education services; (iii) maintain its commitment to carry out \neducation reforms, including national curriculum reform; (iv) provide an \nadequate  budget  to  provide  PSTT;  and  (v)  reform  the  textbook \nprovision  system.  To  achieve  its  impact,  the  Project  assumes  that \nfurther  steady  economic  growth  in  Mongolia  will  create  new  job \nopportunities  for  graduates.  The  managerial  and  technical  capacity  of \nMECS  is  limited  in  some  areas  and  this  might  affect  the  smooth \nimplementation  of  the  extension  of  the  school  system  to  a  12-year \nsystem and the introduction of the new textbook provision and reforms \nin  PSTT.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  training  and  capacity \nbuilding under the Project. A high turnover of officials and senior staff in \nkey  agencies,  resulting  in  slow  progress  or  resistance  to  reforms,  is \nalso  a  risk.  That  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  assurances  confirming \nthe Government\u2019s commitment to education reforms and by adopting a \nstakeholder  participatory  approach,  and  building  core  technical  and \nmanagement  capacity  in  MECS  through  the  Project  and  the  ADB-\nfunded SWAp technical assistance. \n \n\n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\n111  00'Eo\n\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\n\nMONGOLIA\nEDUCATION SECTOR REFORM PROJECT\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaanbayshint\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel\n\nTsagaannuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nOlgiy\n\nTudevtey\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nBULGAN\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nErdenet\n\nSelenge\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nHOVD\n\nUyench\n\nYarantay\n\nTayshir\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nARHANGAY\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBaganuur\n\nBatnorov\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nLun\nZuunmod\nTOV\n\nNalayh\n\nMaanit\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nArvayheer\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nNariynteel\nOVORHANGAY\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nChoyr\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nSaynshand\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\n50  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n8\n-\n3\n1\n8\n6\n \nE\nG\n\n96  00'Eo\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n111  00'Eo\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nMongolia for the Education Sector Reform Project. \n \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant to \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  Mongolia  considers  improving  the  quality  of  the  education  system, \nenhancing  access  to  basic  education,  and  improving  higher  education  to  be  key  instruments  to \nreduce poverty, accelerate economic growth, and  reduce disparities in the development process, \nparticularly  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  In  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  development \nstrategy,  the  Project  is  included  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  country  operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2008\u20132010.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  \n \n3. \nIn 1990, immediately before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Mongolia had a high gross \nenrollment  ratio  and  adult  literacy  rate.  Cessation  of  Soviet  financial  and  technical support  had  a \ndramatic impact on educational provision, quality, and standards and by 1995 the gross enrollment \nratio  had  fallen  to  81%.  Since  this  low  point,  Mongolia  has  made  notable  progress  toward  re-\ndeveloping  its  education  sector.  In  2006,  the  gross  enrollment  rate  had  recovered  to  95%  for \nprimary and secondary education, and the adult literacy rate had been maintained at 97%. Annual \npublic expenditure on education is high (about 7% of gross domestic product) in comparison with \nthat of many neighboring countries.  \n \nThe  ongoing  partnership  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  other  major  funding \n4. \nagencies  (notably  the  Embassy  of  Japan  in  the education  sector)  has  been  a  major  factor  in  the \nspeed of the education sector\u2019s recovery. ADB assistance for the education sector began with the \nEducation Sector Development Program (ESDP), which was approved in 1996. ESDP succeeded \nin  implementing  measures  to  rationalize  the  education  system,  improve  cost  recovery,  support \nprivatization  and  private  sector  provision,  strengthen  management  capabilities,  and  upgrade \neducation  content.  It  contributed  significantly  to  increasing  enrollment  rates  from  81%  in  1996  to \n91%  in  2002,  to  decreasing  dropout  rates  from  3.5%  to  2.3%  over  the  same  period,  and  to \nimproving  the  effectiveness  of  the  system  and  the  quality  of  education  services.  A  post-project \nperformance  evaluation  in  April  2007  rated  the  program  \u201chighly  successful\u201d.  Under  the  Second \nEducation  Development  Project  (SEDP)  and  Third  Education  Development  Project  (TEDP), \napproved in 2002 and 2006 respectively, key initiatives supported by ADB have included in-service \nteacher  training,  development  of  curriculum  and  state  education  standards,  enhancing  education \nmanagement  and  planning,  and  rehabilitation  of  schools  and  learning  spaces.  ADB\u2019s  recent \ncountry  assistance  program  evaluation  report  for  Mongolia2  rated  assistance  to  education  as  the \nbest  performing  part  of  ADB\u2019s  portfolio.  The  proposed  Project  and  the  ongoing  TEDP  are \ncomplementary:  (i)  TEDP  supports  the  development  of  curriculum  and  education  standards  and \nthe proposed Project will support development and provision of textbooks that incorporate the new \ncurriculum; (ii) TEDP supports the national accreditation of teacher training institutes (TTIs) and the \nproposed Project will enhance overall quality of pre-service teacher training (PSTT); and (iii) TEDP \nsupports  in-service  teacher  training  centers  (focusing  on  moving  from  lecturing  to  interactive \nlearning,  using  computer-based  problem  solving  techniques)  and  the  proposed  Project  supports \nthe use of information and communication technology (ICT) for education and the establishment of \nICT centers of excellence (focusing on training and strengthening the skills of teachers to integrate \nICT as a teaching and learning tool). \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010): Mongolia. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Mongolia. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n5. \nAlthough  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  expanding  access  to  education  and \nimplementing  reforms  that  strengthen  the  sector,  further  focused  support  is  needed  in  some  key \nareas  to  improve  and  sustain  education  quality.  Despite  achievements  in  Mongolia\u2019s  education \nsector,  a  significant  proportion  of  children  in  rural  areas  still  do  not  attend  primary  or  secondary \nschool.3 In the countryside, 8% of all children aged 7 to 15 have never enrolled in school, 19% drop \nout  before  completing  grade  8,  and  only  55%  of  students  (45%  in  rural  areas)  complete  upper \nsecondary education.  Improving net enrollment rates in rural areas remains a challenge, and there \nare significant gaps in performance on student achievement tests and progression rates in school \nfor students from rural areas.4 Rural\u2013urban migration has brought new challenges in the education \nsector,  as  schools  in  urban  centers  have  seen  demand  for  services  increase  substantially,  while \nsome rural schools are now operating below capacity as a result of outflows from their catchment \nareas. \n \nThe  Mongolian  education  system  is  currently  undergoing  a  major  change  to  align  it  with \n6. \ninternational standards. According to Clause 7.2 of the Law on Education, with effect from school \nyear (SY) 2008\u20132009, the school system will move from an 11-year to a 12-year system, and the \nschool entry age will be lowered from 7 to 6 years. Approximately 43,000 6-year-olds are expected \nto  join  the  formal  education  system  in  2008.  The  change  will  increase  total  enrollments  by  about \n9%  and  place  greater  demands  on  school  and  classroom  capacity,  teaching  skills,  and  the \nprovision  of  a  range  of  teaching  and  learning  materials.  In  addition,  this  transition  will  require \nadjustments  to  the  curriculum,  PSTT  programs,  teaching  and  learning  materials,  and  age-\nappropriate  school  facilities  for  6-year-old  pupils.  The  Government  has  a  plan  in  its  budgetary \nframework  to  finance  school  facilities  for  6-year-old  pupils  in  primary  schools,  and  has  allocated \nfunds in the 2009 budget for school facilities for this age group. The Government\u2019s commitment is \nreflected in the Letter of Assurance in Supplementary Appendix F. There will also be an impact on \nrelated recurrent costs, budgeting, and management requirements. An overview of the Mongolian \neducation sector and its performance is in Appendix 2. The planned transition to a 12-year school \nsystem has  brought a new range of concerns about access and quality of education in Mongolia \nand the key constraints noted above, which are critical to efforts to improve the access and quality \nof  education  services,  need  to  be  addressed.  A  timely  opportunity  now  exists  for  the  Education \nSector Reform Project to support the Government to move to a 12-year education system in 2008 \nand to help project beneficiaries (educators, pupils, and parents) to meet the new challenges under \nthe new system. \n \nB.  \n \n7. \nThe  Mongolian  education  system  still  faces  rural\u2013urban  disparities  in  educational \nachievement;  low  quality  of  PSTT;  inefficiencies  in  educational  planning  and  management;  and \nchallenges  in  the  provision  of  low-cost,  high-quality  textbooks  and  other  learning  materials, \nincluding the introduction and effective use of ICT in primary and secondary education across the \ncurriculum. The physical infrastructure of TTIs is in urgent need of repair, which reflects shortages \nin government financing of higher education institutions.  \n                     \n8. \nPoverty  and  Education  Costs  to  Parents.  Poverty  continues  to  be  a  major  national \nproblem,  with  32.2%  of  the  population  officially  categorized as  below  the  poverty  threshold.5  The \npoverty  levels  are  much  higher  in  rural  than  in  urban  areas,  although  inward  migration  to  urban \nareas  has  created  growing  pockets  of  poverty  in  ger  settlements.  While  the  percentage  of  the \npopulation below the poverty threshold is decreasing in urban areas, the gap between urban and \nrural poverty is widening and in the Western Region, 51% of the population is below the poverty \n                                                 \n3  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2007. MDG Implementation. Second National Report. Mongolia. \n4  World Bank. 2008. Mongolia: Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review. Washington, DC.  \n5  Established at $2.00 per day, and based on the World Bank Living Standard Measurement Surveys (1998\u20132002 and \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n2006). \n\n \n\n\f3\n\nfinancing \n\nin  2002,  but \n\ninconsistencies \n\nthreshold.  Poverty  has  a  significant  impact  on  school  attendance  and  on  school  quality.  Focus \ngroup  discussions  conducted  in  seven  aimags  with  parents,  teachers,  and  aimag  education \nofficials  revealed  that  in  every  aimag  the  costs  of  education  to  parents,  including  the  costs  of \ntextbooks, stationery, school uniforms, and travel to school are major concerns. The World Bank\u2019s \nHousehold  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  (2002/2003)  indicates  that  textbooks  are  the  highest \nexpenditure item in household spending on education, accounting for 46% of educational spending \nat  the  primary  level  and  43%  at  secondary  level.  For  the  poorest  segment  of  the  population, \ntextbook  costs  account  for  59%  of  educational  expenditures  for  primary  education  and  58%  for \nsecondary education. The Government\u2019s policy of free textbook allocations to 20% of the students \nis insufficient given the national poverty level of 32%. It is also not well targeted, and is reported to \nbe  administered  inefficiently.  For  families  with  more  than  one  child  of  school  age  to  educate, \nmigrants  to  Ulaanbaatar,  and  families  in  rural  areas  education  may  be  unaffordable,  resulting  in \nlower participation in education and higher dropout rates.  \n \n9. \nGovernment  Financing  of  Education.  School  surveys  and  focus  groups  revealed  that \nteachers and school principals are concerned about inadequate capital investment and operational \nbudgets.  Funding  for  maintaining  fixed  assets  is  inadequate,  leading  to  shorter  asset  life  cycles \nand the poor condition and degradation of school buildings and other infrastructure. The guidelines \non  fixed  costs  need  to  be  revised  to  ensure  that  the  ceilings  sufficiently  cover  all  relevant \nexpenditure  items  to  minimize  cost  underruns  experienced  by  most  schools.  The  Government \nrecentralized  education \nin  budget  approval  and \ndisbursement remain, as recentralization has not occurred in one-third of schools (those located in \nUlaanbaatar).  The  shift  to  the  12-year  education  structure  has  far-reaching  implications  for  the \nGovernment's  recurrent  costs,  budgeting,  and  management  requirements.  Increased  education \nenrollments  by  over  40,000  (9%)  per  year  will  also  require  investments  in  additional  facilities  for \nvery young children. An overview of financing in education is in Appendix 2. \n \n10. \nRural\u2013Urban Discrepancies in Education Quality. A significant proportion of the children \nin  rural  areas  still  do  not  attend  primary  or  secondary  school.6  Despite  improvements  in  school \nattendance  over  the  past  5  years,  rural  students  are  still  at  a  disadvantage.  In  particular,  many \nrural  schools  closed  their  upper  secondary  classes  during  the  school  reorganization  and \nrationalization reform in 1997, while provincial center complex schools have only limited numbers \nof upper secondary spaces. There is a widespread public perception that the quality of education in \nrural areas is inferior to that in urban areas, which is confirmed by significant gaps in performance. \nThe  prospect  of  moving  nearer  to  better  education  facilities  and  opportunities  in  urban  areas  is \nreported to be a major cause of migration to urban areas, especially for women.7  \n \nCurriculum  Reform  and  the  Provision  of  Teaching  and  Learning  Materials.  The  11-\n11. \nyear  education  system  launched  in  2005  was  accompanied  by  the  development  of  new  state \neducation  standards.  However,  these  standards  need  to  be  simplified  as  teachers  and  teacher \neducators find them difficult to translate into clear student competencies. The curriculum remains \noverloaded  with  content  and  the  assessment  system  does  not  test  the  new  skills  and \ncompetencies that have been added to the existing content requirements. The shift to the 12-year \nstructure will require further reform of the curriculum and a new set of state education standards. A \nnew  curriculum  is  being  developed  under  the  ADB-funded  TEDP  and  it  will  be  completed  during \nSY2008\u20132009 and piloted during the following year. The state education standards date from 2004 \nand will be revised in 2009. This will require the revision and/or re-publication of all textbooks and \nteachers\u2019  guides  from  2010.  The  development  of  textbooks  and  teachers\u2019  guides  was  liberalized \nand  privatized  from  2005  and  currently  private  publishers  compete  in  the  supply  of  course \nmaterials,  which  are  selected  by  individual  schools.  However,  the  new  system  is  not  working \n                                                 \n6   UNDP. 2007. MDG Implementation. Second National Report.

Mongolian Journal of Social Sciences  45 (4): 82\u2013112. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\neffectively  as  school  administrators,  teachers,  and  parents  have  expressed  concerns  about \ntextbook cost, durability, and availability. Full ownership of a complete set of textbooks is achieved \nby only 37% of students.8 Teachers have to purchase their own copies of students\u2019 textbooks and \nthe  associated  teachers\u2019  guides.  Many  cannot  afford  to  do  this,  which  has  implications  for  the \nquality of the education offered. There also are reported problems with textbook content and with \nthe textbook submission, evaluation, and approval systems. Corruption is reported to be prevalent \nin  the  selection  and  procurement  of  textbooks,  uniforms,  and  school  lunches,  and  textbook \nprocurement  is  not  covered  by  the  Public  Procurement  Law.9  The  current  curriculum  and  the \nassociated textbook problems must be resolved if access to good textbooks is to improve. \n \n12. \nPre-Service  Teacher  Training.  One  of  the  main  constraints  on  improving  educational \nquality is the inadequacy of the PSTT system. The teaching profession has suffered a demotion of \nstatus,  resulting  in  a  shortage  of  qualified  teachers,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  distribution  of \nteachers is unequal among regions, with disadvantaged areas typically receiving less well-trained \nteachers. Overall, only 40% of the graduates from TTIs go to work in schools, and fewer still go to \nwork  in  rural  schools,  although  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science  (MECS)  has \nintroduced  financial  incentives  for  teachers  in  rural  areas.  University  admission  requirements  for \nteachers are much lower than for other professions, and are particularly lower for teacher training \ncolleges  in  provincial  cities,  compared  to  TTIs  in  Ulaanbaatar,  as  demand  for  teacher  training \ncourses has declined in the provinces.10 Low entry standards have lowered the standard of teacher \ngraduates. The financing system for higher education, in which all revenues come from tuition fees, \nmeans TTIs lack incentives to offer teacher training programs and some have opted to offer other \nprograms that generate more revenues. The adoption of a new student-centered curriculum puts a \nhigh premium on effective teacher training and requires pre-service training institutions to provide a \nrange of professional skills required by schools to launch an effective student-centered curriculum. \nAn overview of TTIs is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n13. \nPoor  Maintenance  of  Teacher  Training  Institutes.  Higher  education  has  undergone \nprofound changes since Mongolia\u2019s independence, including deregulation and a rapid increase in \nprivate  higher  education  institutions,  a  considerable  increase  in  student  enrollments  over  the  last \n15 years, and significant changes in government funding of higher education. Faced with priorities \nfor  funding  primary  and  secondary  education,  the  Government  has  cut  spending  on  higher \neducation  and  introduced  fees,  which  institutions  used  to  offset  the  loss  of  direct  state  funding. \nFrom 1997, only heat, water, and electricity costs have been covered by the Government but from \n2001  to  2007  even  this  funding  has  been  limited,  despite  the  1998  education  law,  which  made \nspecific provision for it. The impact of current funding policies on the quality of provision of PSTT \nhas been significant. Mongolia\u2019s TTIs have received very little maintenance and repair for over a \ndecade. Many provide substandard learning environments and spaces. They are in urgent need of \ninvestment in laboratories, libraries, ICT, and refurbishment, and such investments are needed to \nsupport the proposed reforms in PSTT under the Project. Very little funding is allocated to teaching \nand  learning  facilities  (for  example,  to  books  and  journals  in  the  library  or  to  the  Internet  and  e-\nlearning facilities). A generally perceived view is that the physical working environment is not \u201cfit for \npurpose\u201d, with outdated facilities and equipment being the major concern.  \n \n14. \nICT  in  Education  Policies  and  Strategies.  The  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  (ESMP) \n2006\u20132015 confirmed that MECS intends to develop ICT capacity and usage across the curriculum \n\n                                                 \n8   UNICEF Learning Achievement Study (2008) and project preparatory TA School Survey (2008). \n9  ADB.  2008.  Risk  Assessments  and  Risk  Management  Plans  for  National  Systems  and  the  Education  and  Urban \n\nInfrastructure Sectors in Mongolia. Manila. \n\n10 At the Mongolian State University of Education (MSUE), the admission requirement for teachers is 350\u2013450 points out \nof a maximum of 800 in the general education state examinations. The entry level can be as low as 200\u2013250 points in \nTTIs  outside  Ulaanbaatar.  In  contrast,  journalism  and  economics  and  statistics  programs  offered  at  MSUE  require  a \nminimum score of 600 points. \n\n \n\n\f5\n\n(i.e., in all subjects and at all grade levels). ESMP sets targets for levels of computer provision at \nprimary schools (1 computer per 250 students), secondary schools (1 computer per 50 students), \nand high schools (1 computer per 5 students). In addition, the Government is experimenting in a \nnumber of pilot schools with the use of the XO low-cost laptop for all pupils in grades 2\u20135 as part of \nthe  one-laptop-per-child  scheme.  However,  at  present  there  is  no  clearly  defined  national  ICT \nstrategy and no forward projections or calculations have been undertaken to estimate the total cost \nimplications (total cost of ownership) of any of these targets, nor is there a strategy for the use of \ncomputers across the curriculum. Schools complain that their operational budgets are insufficient \nto  pay  for  recurrent  ICT  costs  (power,  telecommunications,  maintenance  and  servicing,  and \nconsumables) and there is inadequate investment in teacher training in the effective use of ICT as \na  teaching  and  learning  tool  and  in  the  development  of  appropriate  software  in  the  Mongolian \nlanguage.  Research  studies  by  ADB  indicate  the  potential  high  cost  and  low  effectiveness  of \nunplanned approaches to ICT provision, the importance of a comprehensive national strategy for \nICT in education, and a clear understanding of the downstream cost implications.11 \n  \n15. \nGender Imbalances in Education. Girls outnumber boys in school in every aimag and in \nUlaanbaatar. Eighty percent12 of students completing secondary education are female, as are 63% \nof tertiary undergraduates. Girls outnumber boys in every higher education discipline except for art, \narchitecture, and engineering. The disparity between boys and girls is highest in rural areas where \ndropout rates for boys are much higher than for girls. Boys are expected to undertake herder roles \nwhile  families  encourage  and  support  girls  to  enter  education  as  a  means  of  providing  for \nthemselves.  The  sharp  increase  in  the  direct  costs  of  education  has  increased  these  gender \ndisparities,  since  the  cost  of  boys\u2019  education  is  now  a  direct  charge  on  families  rather  than  a \ncharge on the state as it was during the central planning period.13 \n \nProject Rationale. Despite progress in the education sector over the past decade, in part \n16. \nbecause  of  the  effective  working  relationship  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  continuing \nsupport  for  reform,  transformation  of  the  education  system,  and  upgrading  of  essential  services \nand facilities are needed. The demands of transition and the loss of Soviet financial support have \ncreated  budget  problems  in  educational  financing,  which  in  turn  have  been  exacerbated  by \nsubstandard  financial  planning  and  management  systems.  Schools  and  higher  education  suffer \nfrom a lack of both capital investment and recurrent budget allocations from the Government and \nthere has been a sharp increase in the direct and the indirect costs of education for parents. These \nhave  reduced  participation  rates,  particularly  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  and  for  boys.  The \ndeterioration  in  educational  provision  in  rural  areas  is  one  of  the  major  reported  causes  of \nmigration to the cities, which in turn brings pressure to bear on urban educational institutions.  \n \nIn this context, the key issues in the current Mongolian education system are the need for \n17. \n(i) reform in education finance, planning, budgeting, and management; (ii) strengthening teaching \nqualifications  and  skills  through  PSTT;  (iii)  improving  quality,  relevance,  affordability,  and \nsustainability in the provision of textbooks and other learning materials, including the effective and \ninnovative  use  of  ICT  for  education,  and  in  view  of  the  introduction  of  student-centered  learning; \nand (iv) improving the education infrastructure, particularly facilities, in TTIs. The Project will build \non the policy platform established by previous projects and continue the reform agenda in tandem \nwith the government\u2019s ESMP and National Development Strategy.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2008.

The  development  of  a  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp)  is  a  key \nplatform  of  the  ESMP  2006\u20132015,  which  was  prepared  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  in  2005.  An \neducation donors\u2019 consultative mechanism (EDCM), co-chaired by MECS, ADB, and the Embassy \nof  Japan,  was  established  in  2005  and  it  guides  collaboration  between  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment  partners.  In  2007,  ADB  supported  a  TA  project  for  the  Development  of  a  SWAp  in \nEducation.14  Under  this  TA,  the  Government  has  made  progress  in  developing  an  effective \napproach to sector-wide planning. The EDCM prepares and monitors annual implementation plans \nto track the significant progress being made in integrating the SWAp into the Government\u2019s internal \nplanning  process  and  the  fiscal  cycle.  The  key  projects  in  the  education  sector  in  Mongolia  are \nbeing  implemented  by  one  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  an  important  step  toward \nharmonization. For example, the ADB PIU for the TEDP is also in charge of the Education for All-\nFast  Track  Initiative15  (EFA-FTI)  implementation.  ADB  TA  support  for  the  SWAp  has  been \nextended to 2008\u20132009 and aims to strengthen MECS\u2019s core technical and management capacity \nto take a phased approach to establishing a SWAp in education. The Project complements other \nfunding  agencies\u2019  efforts  by  supporting  areas  they  are  not  addressing,  e.g.,  provision  of  cheaper \ntextbooks  and  comprehensive  reforms  in  PSTT.  The  development  of  a  national  ICT  strategy \ncomplements other funding agencies\u2019 investments in computer hardware, including the one-laptop-\nper-child initiative, funded by several funding agencies. The project concept was presented at the \ngeneral EDCM meeting. Appendix  3 summarizes external  assistance to the Mongolian education \nsector. \n \nLessons  Learned.  Lessons  learned  from  previous  ADB-funded  education  projects16 \n19. \ninclude the need for (i) close funding agency coordination, particularly in areas where there may be \noverlapping  inputs  (e.g.,  school  buildings),  and  a  comprehensive  working  partnership  between \ndevelopment  partners  and  the  Government;  (ii)  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nbudgets to support investments in equipment and facilities and to ensure effective usage (this is a \nmajor issue, for example, in the development of a national ICT strategy); and (iii) an approach that \nbuilds  on  experience  gained  in  past  projects  rather  than  shifting  focus  to  new  areas  of  activity. \nThus, the grant assistance for ICT for Innovating Rural Education in Mongolia (IIREM) provides a \nmodel for using ICT to develop content, new teaching approaches, and access to information for \npoor  rural  schools.  It  will  serve  as  the  starting  point  for  sustainable  and  cost-effective  ICT \ndevelopments  under  this  Project.  Similarly,  the  expense  of  learning  and  teaching  materials  will \nhave an adverse impact on the curriculum reform currently being undertaken by the ADB-funded \nTEDP, unless this issue is addressed by the Project. Detailed lessons learned are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Education  Sector  Reform.

The  outcome  of  the  Project will  be  an  effective  12-year  education \nsystem. \n \nB.  \n \n21. \nThe  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  improved  education  planning,  management,  and \nbudgeting;  (ii)  strengthened  PSTT;  (iii)  improved  quality,  affordability,  and  levels  of  provision  of \ntextbooks and other teaching and learning materials, including enhanced innovation in the use of \nICT  in  the  classroom;  and  (iv)  improved  learning  conditions  in  TTIs  through  support  for  the \nupgrading of the physical infrastructure. The outputs were derived through extensive consultation \nwith  stakeholders  from  public,  private,  and  nongovernmental  sectors  at  central  and  local  levels, \nincluding in remote locations, school visits, school surveys, and focus groups.  \n \n \n\nImproved  Educational  Planning,  Management,  and \n\n1. \n \n\nComponent  1: \nBudgeting \n\n \nThis component will (i) strengthen the institutional capacity of MECS to enable it to carry out \n22. \nmore efficient planning, management, and delivery of education services; and (ii) improve existing \neducation finance policies to promote autonomy, transparency, and accountability at all levels.  \n \nStrengthening  Information  Systems.  Under  the  SEDP,  ADB  funding  was  allocated  to \n23. \nfinance  the  procurement  of  hardware  and  software  for  the  education  management  information \nsystem  (EMIS).  Project  preparatory  TA  assessments  indicate  that  continued  TA  is  needed  to \nimprove both the technical and operational aspects  of the existing system. Currently, there are a \nnumber of management information systems within MECS, including the EMIS in the Department \nof  Information,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation;  the  human  resource  MIS  in  the  Department  of  Public \nAdministration;  and  the  financial  MIS  in  the  Department  of  Economics  and  Finance.  Various \ndepartments maintain subsets of the MIS for their own operational and professional disciplines. A \nschool infrastructure MIS subset and better integration of the various systems are urgently needed. \nThe  Project  will  support  MECS  to:  (i)  assess  the  current  education  planning  and  management \nsystem;  (ii)  establish  guidelines  for  the  use  of  information  for  education  planning  and  developing \nannual  implementation  plans;  (iii)  design  an  MIS  system  that  fully  integrates  all  data  sources, \nincluding those that may be developed in future; (iv) provide the software and hardware required to \ncarry out data collection and analysis at aimag, bagh, and soum levels; (v) strengthen the capacity \nof  staff  in  gathering  and  analyzing  statistics,  performance  and  quality  indicators,  reporting,  and \nforecasting;  and  (vi)  ensure  the  use  of  gender-disaggregated  data  and  the  inclusion  of  means  to \naddress  gender  issues  in  primary  and  secondary  education  through  a  synchronized  EMIS.  The \nProject will also help to ensure that the financial MIS subset is compatible with the existing system \nat the Ministry of Finance.  \n \nImproving  School-Based  Financial  Policies.  The  Government\u2019s  recentralization  of \n24. \neducation financing in 2002 has not achieved its objective of simplifying processes and increasing \ntransparency  in  school  accounting.  The  process  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  not  uniform \nthroughout the country despite the fact that the Public Sector Management and Finance Law has \nclear provisions on transparency, accountability, and control. The Project will support school-based \nfinancial  reforms  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  conducting  assessments  of  education  finance \nrecentralization and reinforcing compliance in all schools throughout the country, including those in \nUlaanbaatar; (ii) reforming the public investment system so that fixed asset investments and O&M \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nin  order \n\nbudgets  are  closely  linked;  (iii)  adjusting  school  budgeting  systems  to  enable  them  to  allocate \nappropriate amounts for operational expenses (a block grant system based on a funding formula is \nstrongly recommended); (iv) conducting a study on reforming the school teacher salary system and \nappointment  of  school  and  preschool  principals \nto  enhance  responsibility  and \naccountability in schools; (v) preparing a school management handbook and ICT support systems \nfor school management; and (vi) strengthening the capacity of MECS staff, aimag finance officers, \nschool administrators, and accountants in budgeting and financial management. With regard to the \npublic  investment  system,  the  Project  will  support  the  Government  by  (i)  building  capacity  to \nassess  and  monitor  investments  in  infrastructure  and  facilities  in  educational  institutions;  \n(ii)  developing  appropriate  and  practical  criteria  for  the  allocation  of  annual  O&M  funding;  and  \n(iii)  setting  up  a  functional  MIS  to  enable  adequate  monitoring  and  assessment,  to  ensure  the \nlinkage  between  investment  and  recurrent  costs,  and  hence  sufficient  allocations.  In  accordance \nwith the gender action plan in Appendix 9, the Project will support (i) development and inclusion of \nfunding  criteria  to  include  gender,  poverty,  and  indigenous  considerations;  (ii)  preparation  of \ninclusive  social  development  plans  that  incorporate  an  analysis  of  gender  issues  and  plans  for \naddressing them, including identifying barriers to boys\u2019 participation in education; and (iii) a study \nof policies targeting dormitory subsidies and cash transfers at poor rural households, in particular, \nfor boys.  \n \n25.  Midterm  National  ICT  Strategy.  The  experience  of  other  countries  suggests  that  ICT  is \noften more expensive than governments realize and that unplanned ICT developments may divert \nmoney away from other areas of educational need. Failure to provide sufficient operational budgets \nto  cover  hardware  replacement,  consumables,  and  other  recurrent  costs  could  lead  to  the \nwidespread  non-use,  under-use,  or  misuse  of  facilities.  In  addition  to  the  important  planning  and \nfinancing aspects mentioned above, the ICT strategy for the sector should help to guide teaching \napproaches  and  ICT  arrangements  suitable  for  effective  use  in  Mongolian  schools.  Studies \nincreasingly emphasize the need to contextualize these arrangements to suit the circumstances of \neach  individual  country.17  Technologically  highly sophisticated  ICT  arrangements  may  not  always \nbe the most cost-efficient in terms of improving teaching and learning. Often less sophisticated, but \ninnovative and more appropriate approaches can add more value to learning, and be more cost-\nefficient and sustainable.  \n \n26. \nThe scale of the financial implications of ICT provision for the education system mean there \nis an urgent need for an ICT midterm strategy (5 years), detailing the cost implications for primary \nand  secondary  education.  This  should  include  (i)  the  legal  framework;  (ii)  ICT  objectives  and \noutputs; \nICT  skills  and \ncompetencies;  (iv)  short-  and  medium-term  ICT  policy  and  strategy;  (v)  minimum  profiles  and \ntarget  ratios18  for  computer  hardware  and  peripherals;  (vi)  connectivity;  (vii)  content  development \nstrategy\u2014software  and  websites  in  Mongolian  and  the  use  of  basic  applications  software  in \nsupport  of  subject  teaching  and  learning;  (viii)  teacher,  technician,  and  school  management \ntraining;  (ix)  maintenance  and  servicing  strategies;  (x)  teacher  support  services;  (xi)  school  local \narea network management requirements; (xii) school EMIS specifications; and (xiii) budget support \nand  operational  and  replacement  financing  requirements.  The  Project  will  finance  technical \nassistance  and  training  in  the  techniques  of  national  strategy  development  and  the  available \noptions; and the operational costs of a national ICT strategy working group, including a series of \nstrategy development workshops. \n \n \n\n(iii)  curriculum  and  assessment\u2014encouraging  and  developing \n\n \n\n                                                 \n17  An  IIREM  project  (TA  on  Innovative  ICT  in  Education  and  Its  Potential  in  Reducing  Poverty  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific \n\nRegion) in 2008 presented case study reports on several countries, including  Mongolia.  \n\n18  E.g.,  the  minimum  ICT  hardware  specifications  such  as  number  and  type  of  computers,  printers,  UPS,  scanners, \n\nprojectors, digital cameras, and minimum acceptable ratio of hardware to students. \n\n \n\n\f9\n\nComponent 2 : Strengthened Pre-Service Teacher Education \n\n2.  \n \n27. \nThis component will improve the quality of provision and the outputs of the PSTT system to \nsupport  to  the  launch  of  the  new  12-year  curriculum.  An  overview  of  TTIs  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n \n28. \nCurriculum  Reform.  The  current  teacher  education  curriculum  has  not  been  reviewed  or \nupdated  since  2005\u20132006.  It  is  overloaded  and  theoretical,  with  only  15%  of  the  total  credits \nrequired for bachelor programs being allocated to teaching practice. There are few opportunities to \nreinforce  ideas  and  concepts  across  subjects.  The  Project  will  (i)  initiate  a  teacher  education \ncurriculum review to ensure conformity with the newly developed teacher standards, and (ii) assist \nMECS and TTIs to increase school-based teaching practice and the use of ICT in the curriculum.  \n \nComprehensive  Quality  Assurance  System  in  TTIs.  Low  student  entry  qualifications  in \n29. \nTTIs  affect  the  quality  of  teacher  graduates.  Furthermore,  the  student  assessment  system  is \npredominantly  through  written  tests  and  oral  examinations  conducted  by  individual  institutions \nwithout  reference  to  national  standards.  These  tests  focus  on  students\u2019  ability  to  remember  facts \nrather than to demonstrate skills gained during study and practice. The Project will assist TTIs and \nrelevant  departments  of  MECS  to  (i)  put  in  place  national  minimum  admission  standards  and \nprocedures  for  all  TTIs,  (ii)  implement  a  national  student  teachers  assessment  framework,  and  \n(iii) support teacher educators in five TTIs to implement the quality assurance system. The Project \nwill  also  help  to  ensure  that  the  quality  assurance  system  is  understood  and  applied  across  the \nsector. The Project will ensure that TTIs (i) take gender into account in teacher training curricula, \nmaterials, and courses; (ii) deliver gender-sensitive teaching to all student teachers in TTIs and to \nall  teacher  educators;  (iii)  develop  selection  criteria  that  include  a  focus  on  gender  equity  and \nencourage men to be student teachers in TTIs; and (iv) attract top students to TTIs and teachers to \nthe profession by ensuring attractive salaries and social benefits are in place, including incentives \nfor teachers in rural areas. \n \nContinuous Professional Development (CPD). Increasing workloads and lack of funding \n30. \nfor CPD and research have affected teacher educators\u2019 professional development. Lack of foreign \nlanguages  (particularly  English)  makes  it  difficult  for  them  to  learn  about  recent  innovations  in \nteacher training and new teaching methodologies, ideas, and approaches. The Project will help to \nstrengthen  the  CPD  of  teacher  educators  by  (i)  helping  MECS  and  TTIs  to  adopt  a  funding \nmechanism  for  providing  CPD  to  teacher  educators;  (ii)  assisting  TTIs  to  develop  a  professional \ndevelopment  planning  system,  including  conducting  training  needs  analysis;  (iii)  training  TTI \nadministrators  and  heads  of  departments  in  professional  development  planning;  and  (iv)  training \nteacher educators in student-centered learning methods and assessment of student teachers\u2019 skills \nand competencies and using ICT. The Project will also support international institutional links and \nstaff attachment schemes.  \n \nTeaching  Practice.  International  experience  indicates  that  teaching  practice  and  school-\n31. \nbased  training  should  be  the  cornerstone  of  teacher  education.  This  is  not  the  case  in  teacher \neducation  programs  in  Mongolia,  where  content  knowledge,  educational  theory,  and  practice  are \ndelivered  separately  with  an  assumption  that  effective  integration  of  these  components  will  take \nplace in the minds of the students at a later stage. To support school-based teaching practice, the \nProject  will  (i)  develop  a  conceptual  and  regulatory  framework  for  a  new  school-based  teaching \npractice  model,  (ii)  develop  operational  guidelines  for  the  new  model,  (iii)  pilot  the  model  in  two \nTTIs in school years 2010\u20132011 and 2011\u20132012, and (iv) support full- scale implementation of the \nnew school-based teaching practice model starting in SY2012\u20132013. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n\n \n\n3. \n \n\nComponent  3:  Improved  Affordability,  Quality,  and  Availability  of  Teaching \nand Learning Materials \n\n \n32. \nThis  component  will  (i)  reduce  the  costs  and  improve  the  quality  and  availability  of \ntextbooks  and  teachers\u2019  guides  in  primary  schools;  and  (ii)  build  on  the  work  of  IIREM  by \ncontinuing the delivery of content, teaching methods, and information to poor schools in rural areas \nvia the cost-effective use of ICT.  \n \n33. \nDesign and Implementation of a Pilot Project. The pilot project will test the effectiveness \nof a textbook rental scheme and revolving fund in primary grades. The object will be to reduce the \nparental costs of education significantly and to increase textbook quality and durability. Adequate \navailability  of  textbooks  is  one  of  the  most  important  factors  in  ensuring  learning.  Experience \nworldwide,  and  particularly  in  other  countries  in  transition,  has  demonstrated  that  textbook  rental \nsystems,  combined  with  long  textbook  life  achieved  through  mandatory  minimum  production \nspecifications,  enables  textbook  origination  and  production  costs  to  be  amortized  over  at  least  4 \nyears,  significantly  reducing  costs  to  parents.  Well-run  textbook  rental  schemes  are  widely \nacknowledged  to  be  the  least  costly  and  the  most  effective  and  equitable  form  of  textbook \nprovision.  These  systems  also  underpin  rapid  development  of  private  textbook  publishers  in \npartnership  with  Government  by  creating  a  reliable  and  predictable  textbook  market.  When \ncombined with a simple computerized textbook ordering system, the system eliminates the risk of \nwaste  through  lack  of  sales,  thus  reducing  publishers\u2019  costs  and  hence  prices  to  the  schools. \nAppendix 11 contains an overview of textbook rental schemes and revolving funds.  \n \n34. \nA  textbook  rental  scheme  and  revolving  funds  will  begin  as  a  pilot  in  primary  schools  at \nselect aimags and, if successful, will be scaled up to other aimags. The component will (i) support \nthe  design  and  implementation  of  a  pilot  textbook  rental  scheme  and  revolving  funds  in  primary \ngrades;  (ii)  improve  the  targeting  and  transparent  administration  of    MECS  support  for  poor  and \nvulnerable  children;  (iii)  provide  training  in  all  aspects  of  textbook  conceptualization,  authorship, \ndesign, and specification, including the specific requirements of textbooks and teachers\u2019 guides to \nsupport  student-centered  learning;  (iv)  review  and  reform  the  competitive  textbook  submission, \nevaluation,  and  contract  award  system  to  provide  a  transparent  and  timely  system,  oriented  to \nproviding the highest quality and durability at the best prices; (v) provide financial support for the \ncompetitive procurement through school-based decision making of about 2 million textbooks for a \ncost reduction and quality upgrading pilot project, with a view to extending the pilot to the whole of \nthe  primary  sector  if  successful;  (vi)  fund  consulting  services  and  training  to  support  the  pilot \nproject;  (vii)  fund  fully  participatory  meetings  with  parents  and  schools  in  all  aimags  in  order  to \ngenerate  grassroots  understanding  and  support  for  new  textbook  provision  strategies;  and  (viii) \nfund the design and development of a simple computerized ordering system.   \n \n35. \nInformation Access to Poor Schools in Rural Areas. IIREM has made a good start on \ndeveloping strategies and materials specifically oriented to the needs of poor rural schools and it is \nproposed  that  the  Project  should  build  on  these  foundations.  The  Project  will  support  the \nestablishment of ICT centers of excellence in selected schools in rural and peri-urban  ger areas, \nwith a focus on training and strengthening the skills of teachers to integrate ICT as a teaching and \nlearning  tool,  rather  than  on  the  ICT  hardware.  The  ICT  centers  of  excellence  will  facilitate \nunderstanding  among  teachers  of  the  benefits  of  technology  in  planning  their  lessons.  The \ncomponent  will  develop  and  disseminate  locally-applicable  models  using  student-centered \nmethodologies  and  technology.  Such  centers  will  encourage  communities  of  educators  to  bring \ninnovation  to  teaching  and  learning.  The  component  will  build  on  the  IIREM  mentor  schools  and \nteachers\u2019 teams and will provide hands-on training and workshops to develop local capacity. It will \nalso support the authorship of manuals, guidelines, users\u2019 guides, and simple standard operating \nprocedures; the provision of some basic software applications; and the provision of basic hardware \npackages  to  enable  schools  to  develop  e-materials.  It  will also  develop  ICT  in  rural  schools  as  a \n\n \n\n\f11\n\nmanagement  tool  and  provide  community  access  to  ICT,  particularly  for  nonformal  education \npurposes.  For  this  component,  two  groups  of  schools  will  be  targeted.  First,  schools  that  were \nbeneficiaries of the IIREM project will be given priority, to ensure continuity of ICT training. Second, \nthe  component  will  target  schools  where  school  management  and  MECS  provide  evidence  that \nadequate budget will be made available for ICT operational expenses, and which have an existing \ntechnological infrastructure. This second group of schools will include schools in rural areas with at \nleast 30% of enrolled students from poor families and cluster schools, and at least one school in \naimags  with  a  high  proportion  of  ethnic  minorities,  such  as  Bayan-Olgiy.  In  order  to  keep \nadministration costs low, a maximum of five aimags will participate in the pilot. Project preparation \nincluded  an  investigation  into  Mongolian  law  relating  to  charities  and  charitable  trusts  and  it  is \nunderstood that a secure textbook revolving fund will qualify for charitable status.  \n \n36. \nThe  component  will  support  (i)  extension  of  the  use  of  ICT  in  the  delivery  of  new \napproaches to teaching and learning targeted at poor rural situations, including ICT training on the \nuse of the common software applications across all grades (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets, \npresentation software, and databases); (ii) development of software in Mongolian aimed at teacher \ndevelopment through ICT skills upgrading; (iii) creation of a website to encourage collaboration and \nthe exchange of ideas and experiences between rural teachers; (iv) establishment of ICT centers \nof excellence which focus on strengthening the skills of teachers to integrate ICT into their teaching \nand on creating communities of educators; (v) development of a disk delivery system for schools \nwithout easy access to the Internet; and (vi) the inclusion of the pilot project as an integral part of \nthe  national  ICT  strategy  development  under  component  1.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  \n(i) textbooks, supplementary materials, ICT applications, and software do not stereotype genders \nor ethnic groups; and (ii) free textbooks are provided for poor and vulnerable families. \n \n\n4.  Component  4:  Upgraded  Facilities  at  Teacher  Training  Institutes  to  Support \n\nReforms in Pre-Service Teacher Training \n\nincluding \n\n(ii)  supplying \n\nlaboratory  equipment; \n\nfurniture  and  equipment, \n\n \n37. \nThis  component  will  improve  facilities  in  selected  TTIs  by  (i)  developing  technical \nspecifications  for  laboratory  equipment  and  instructional  manuals,  holding  workshops,  and \nsupplying \nICT;  \n(iii)  rehabilitating  facilities;  and  (iv)  improving  provision  of  teaching  and  learning  resources.  TTI \nlibraries  lack  modern  materials  on  new  teaching  technologies,  education  journals,  and  other \nresources that would facilitate and support independent learning of student teachers. The Project \nwill support: (i) a needs analysis of teaching and learning materials in four TTIs and the Mongolian \nState  University  of  Education;  (ii)  authorship,  design,  and  publication  of  a  new  generation  of \nteacher  training  course  materials;  (iii)  production  and  supply  of  new  teacher  training  course \nmaterials;  (iv)  provision  of  Mongolian  language  abstracts  of  articles  in  international  journals;  and  \n(v) support for library stocks and ICT facilities. To improve the quality of teaching and learning in \nTTIs, some facilities will be upgraded and classroom furniture and ICT equipment will be provided \nto selected TTIs. Selection of the TTIs will prioritize: (i) state-run TTIs, (ii) TTIs in Ulaanbaatar and \nremote  aimags,  and  (iii)  TTIs  that  are  not  included  in  any  present  or  future  expansion  or \nrehabilitation program sponsored by any other agency. \n \n38. \nProject  Management  Capacity  Enhanced.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  with \nprescribed monitoring and evaluation arrangements will oversee project operations. Transparency \n(with  appropriate  guidelines  and  processes)  will  be  built  into  all  project  activities  including  \n(i)  competitive  and  open  selection  procedures  for  consultants  and  project  staff,  (ii)  rigorous \ntendering arrangements for infrastructure and equipment contracting, (iii) mandatory performance \nand  financial  reporting,  (iv)  public  reporting  requirements  for  project  activities,  and  (v)  external \naudits  and  reviews.  A  website  on  project  activities  and  outputs  will  be  established  and  regularly \nupdated to ensure openness and public disclosure. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nC.  \n \n39. \nInnovative Approach to Education. Reforms in the management of educational financing \nwill improve efficiency and quality by ensuring that recurrent budgets are adequate, and will enable \nschool facilities and equipment to be used to their full potential. The focus on PSTT will create a \nstream of well-trained teachers with skills relevant to the new curriculum. The Project\u2019s innovations \nwill  include  (i)  lowering  costs  and  upgrading  quality  of  learning  and  teaching  materials,  thereby \nreducing parental costs, increasing access, and improving education quality; and (ii) supporting the \neffective  and  innovative  use  of  ICT  in  education,  particularly  in  rural  areas,  by  developing  a \nnational  ICT  strategy  for  primary  and  secondary  education  and  by  establishing  ICT  centers  of \nexcellence in selected schools in rural areas.   \n \n40. \nPoverty  Focus.  The  Project  has  a  strong  focus  on  poor  and  otherwise  disadvantaged \npupils in  remote  rural  areas.  The  cost  of  textbooks is  a  major  reason for  children not  enrolling  in \nschool  or  dropping  out  and  the  Project  will  significantly  reduce  these  costs  for  parents.  It  will \nestablish adequate recurrent budgeting, which will reduce school demands for additional parental \ncontributions,  another  cause  of  dropouts  among  poor  families.  The  ICT  component  will  focus  on \nthe use of ICT in poor schools in rural areas and ger districts in peri-urban areas.  \n \nD.  \n \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $10,830,000,  of  which  $10,000,000  will  be \n41. \nfinanced from Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant funds and $830,000 by the Government in the \nform of taxes and duties (Table 1). \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n\nBase Costa \n1.  \n2. \n3. \n\nImproved Educational Planning, Management, and Budgeting \nStrengthened Pre-service Teacher Education \nImproved  Affordability,  Quality,  and  Availability  of  Teaching  and \nLearning Materials \nUpgraded Facilities at Teacher Training Institutes to Support \nReforms in Pre-Service Teacher Training \nProject Management \nSubtotal (A) \nContingencies \nPhysical Contingenciesb \nPrice Contingenciesc \nSubtotal (B) \n \n\nTotal (A+B) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nB. \n \n \n \n \n\n4. \n\n5. \n \n \n1. \n2. \n \n \n\nAmounts\n \n\n0.58\n1.78\n \n\n4.86\n\n \n\n2.19\n0.75 \n10.17\n\n0.50\n0.15\n0.65\n   10.83d\n\ninflation rate at 14.9% in 2009, 9.5% in 2010, 9%  in 2011, and 8% in 2012 and onwards. \n\n           a  In early 2008 prices, including taxes and duties of $0.83 million financed by the Government. \n           b  Computed at 10% for all civil works and 5% for equipment. \n           c  Computed based on foreign exchange inflation rate of 8.0 % in 2008 and onwards, and local currency    \n \n       d   Totals may not tally due to rounding. \n       Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nProject Financing Plan \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  grant  financing  of  $10  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \n42. \nresources, representing 92.34% of the total project cost.

MECS  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  The  implementation  structure  will  be \nbased on the project implementation arrangements established under the ESDP and subsequently \nused successfully for the SEDP and TEDP. The PSC chaired by the state secretary of MECS will \ninclude  senior  officials  of  MOF  and  MECS  and  project  aimag  representatives  will  provide  overall \nguidance.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  and  will  be  responsible  for  approving  the  annual  project \nbudget  and  activity  plan  and  for  reviewing  and  advising  on  implementation  progress.  Working \ngroups to advise on and assist with project implementation will be established centrally and in pilot \nareas.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  responsible  for  the  daily  operation  of  the  TEDP  will \noversee and manage the work undertaken by the implementing agencies, overall management of \nproject finance, and project implementation. The PIU has been in place since the mid-1990s and \nthe  staff  are  very  experienced  in  procurement,  consultant  recruiting,  and  overall  project \nimplementation.  New  PIU  staff  whose  salaries  are  paid  from  the  grant  will  be  selected  and \ncontracted individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Given  the  evolving  SWAp  in  Mongolia\u2019s  education  sector,  project \nmanagement needs to be well coordinated with financial planning and management at MECS. In \nthe  long  term,  MECS\u2019s  capacity  to develop  and  manage  an  effective  SWAp  should  increase  and \nthere should be less dependence on traditional PIUs and more on the use of MECS\u2019s structures. \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over a period of 4 years from 2009 to 2013. The detailed \n\n2.   \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n44. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3.   \n\nProcurement \n\n \n45. \nAll  procurement  shall  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  for  goods  estimated  to  cost  $0.5  million  or  more  and \ncontracts  for  works  estimated  to  cost  $1  million  or  more  shall  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost less than \nthe  above  ICB  thresholds  but  more  than  $100,000  shall  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  Public  Procurement  Law  of \nMongolia, subject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to \ncost  $100,000  or  less  shall  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  For  ICB  invitations  for  bids, \nfor  prequalification,  draft  prequalification  documents,  draft  bidding  documents, \ninvitations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nprequalification,  and  bid  evaluation  reports  are  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  prior  review  and \napproval. For NCB, the first draft English language version of the procurement documents should \nbe submitted for ADB review and approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. The ADB-\napproved  procurement  documents  should  then  be  used  as  a  model  for  all  NCB  procurement \nfinanced by ADB for the Project, and need not be subjected to further review.  ADB will review the \nbid evaluation report and award of contract on a post-review basis. For shopping, ADB will review \nthe  award  of  the  contract  on  a  post-review  basis.  MECS  will  develop  distribution  systems  for \ntextbooks  and  learning  materials  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB  that  will  ensure  transparent \ndistribution  of  these  goods  to  project  beneficiaries,  before  disbursing  the  project  funds  for  these \nitems. The procurement plan is in Appendix 6.  \n \n46. \nAdvance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  ADB  has  approved  advance \ncontracting  to  expedite  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts  and  recruitment  of  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation consultants. It has also approved a request for retroactive financing for civil works and \nrehabilitation of TTI facilities and equipment. This is due to an urgent need to initiate these works \nas  the  construction  season  in  Mongolia  is  short  and  to  the  currently  dilapidated  state  of  TTI \nfacilities as a result of limited government funding over the last 10 years. The requested retroactive \nfinancing is for eligible expenditures up to $1 million (equivalent to 10% of the ADB grant) incurred \nin  relation  to  civil  works  and  recruitment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants  within  a \nmaximum of 12 months before the signing of the Grant Agreement. \n \n\n4.    Consulting Services \n \n47. \nThe Project will require a total of 18 person-months of international consulting services and \n150 person-months of national consulting services financed under the ADB grant. A consulting firm \nwill  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  the \nstandard  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  (80%  quality  and  20%  cost)  and  a  simplified \ntechnical  proposal.  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  education \nfinance, management, and planning; (ii) textbook provision systems, cost reduction strategies, and \ntextbook  publishing  skills;  (iii)  development  and  implementation  of  national  strategies  for  ICT  in \neducation, the use of ICT as a learning and teaching tool and local language educational software \ndevelopment;  (iv)  all  aspects  of  pre-service  teacher  training;  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nCapacity  building  for  the  EA  and  the  PIU  will  be  achieved  through  consultant  inputs,  training \ncourses  provided  by  universities,  specialized  institutes,  and  firms,  and  acquisition  of  additional \nequipment  financed  from  the  grant.  To  assist  the  EA  and  the  PIU  in  expediting  project \nimplementation, 3 person-months of national consulting services for monitoring and evaluation will \nbe  engaged  individually  prior  to  recruitment  of  the  consulting  firm.  MECS  requested  ADB  for \nretroactive  financing  of  up  to  $40,000  equivalent  for  expenditures  incurred  in  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Advance  contracting  will  include  advertising  the \npositions,  review,  and  evaluation  of  candidates  on  a  competitive  basis,  and  clearance  of  the \nevaluation  and  the  proposed  selection.  The  Government  was  advised  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  Indicative \nconsultancy requirements are in Appendix 7 and outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n5.  \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n48. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  executing  agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \n\n \n\n\f15\n\n6.  \n\n7.  \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n \n \n49. \nThe grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through the timely release of \ngrant proceeds, the PIU will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. \nDisbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal \napplication and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other things \nthat  the  goods  and/or  services  are  (i)  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries  and (ii)  eligible  for \nADB  financing.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the \nestimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower. \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  or  replenish \neligible  expenses  that  do  not  exceed  $100,000.  In  addition,  grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  using \ndirect payment to the consultants or suppliers for civil works and equipment. \n \n \n \n50. \nThe  Government,  through  the  PIU,  will  (i)  maintain  separate  financial  accounts  for  the \nProject,  and  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB in accordance with the provision of the Grant Agreement \nand  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Reporting  and  Auditing  of  Projects  Financed  by  the  Bank.19 \nThe  auditors  should  have  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be part of the annual audit \nand a separate audit opinion will be submitted. The Government will submit to ADB certified copies \n(in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements and the related reports to auditors, \nwithin  6  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  For  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the \nrequirements for the annual audited financial statements, the proceeds of this grant may be used \nto  finance  expenditures  for  private  financial  statements,  sector  auditors,  and  translations  of \nauditor\u2019s reports into English. The PIU will submit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB \n(in  English)  and  to  the  Government  on  all  aspects  of  project  implementation.  The  reports  will \ninclude  details  of  overall  implementation  progress,  problems  encountered  during  the  reporting \nperiod,  measures  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of \nactivities for the following quarter. Within 3 months of project completion, the PIU will prepare and \nsubmit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on (i) the utilization and \nimpact  of  the  grant;  (ii)  performance  of  the  project;  (iii)  economic  and  social  benefits  generated; \nand (iv) details about implementation, costs, and other information requested by ADB. \n \nG. \n \n51.  MECS  will  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS) \nacceptable to ADB. The PPMS will (i) assess project performance; (ii) evaluate delivery of planned \nactivities;  (iii)  measure  project  impacts;  (iv)  measure  education,  social,  and  economic  benefits, \nfocusing on disadvantaged students from poor, remote, and rural areas; and (v) monitor progress \ntoward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  other  government  targets.  PPMS  indicators  will \nserve  as  a basis  for  reports  on  project  implementation  and  the  reform  process, education  quality \nand  access  to  education,  and  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Some \nindicators will be monitored by routine administrative and financial data. Where feasible, indicators \nwill be disaggregated by socioeconomic level and gender.

For the textbook reform component, \nbaseline  and  follow-up  information  will  be  collected  from  beneficiaries  and  non-beneficiaries  to \nmeasure impact and assess the costs and benefits of reforms.  \n \nH. \n \n52. \nADB and the Government will jointly undertake reviews of the Project at least once a year. \nThe  reviews  will  assess  progress  in  each  component,  identify  issues  and  constraints,  and \ndetermine necessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted during \nthe  third  year  of  implementation.  This  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements  and  identify  adjustments  required;  (ii)  assess  implementation  progress  against \nperformance \nimplementation \narrangements, if necessary.   \n\nindicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes \n\nthe  design  or \n\nin \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n53. \nProject  Benefits.  The  targeted  outcome  of  the  Project  is  an  effective  12-year  school \nsystem  that  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  human  capital  development,  poverty  reduction,  and \ninclusive  social  development.  The  close  link  between  educational  development  and  poverty \nreduction,  productivity  improvement,  economic  growth,  and  an  improvement  in  general  living \nconditions  is  well  established.  The  Project  focuses  on  quality  improvements  to  the  national \neducation  system  that  will  complete  the  transition  of  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  and  improve \nenrollment  and  retention  rates.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  modernization  of  the  education \nsystem will be all students enrolled in primary and secondary schools. Nationwide, about 540,000 \nstudents  and  their  parents  will  benefit  from  the  improved  affordability,  cost,  and  durability  of \ntextbooks and learning materials. About 110,000 students from poor families will benefit from better \ntargeting  of  free  textbook  provision  under  the  Project.  About  10,000  student  teachers  and  1,200 \nteacher educators throughout the country will benefit from improvements to PSTT in five TTIs and \nupgrading  of  teaching  and  learning  facilities.  Graduates  of  TTIs  entering  the  teaching  labor  force \nwill be better equipped to improve education quality and to close the urban\u2013rural gap in education \nachievement.  Students  and  communities  in  rural  areas  will  benefit  from  the  ICT  centers  of \nexcellence. Better targeting of textbook provision and cheaper textbooks will enable poor students \nto  improve  their  educational  achievements.  It  will  also  reduce  dropout  rates  and  increase \nenrollment  rates.  Sound  budgeting,  planning,  and  financing  in  the  education  sector  will  enable \nmore  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  services  to  overcrowded  schools  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  to \ndeprived rural schools. Other specific project benefits include stronger planning and management \nat  MECS  and  among  local  education  staff,  leading  to  an  improved  SWAp,  and  more  capacity  to \nplan and implement ICT investments. \n \n54. \nEconomic  Impacts.  The  Project  supports  the  education  system\u2019s  efforts  to  improve \neducation  quality,  access,  effectiveness,  and  efficiency.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  were \nderived for the Project; the main quantifiable benefits were future earnings and capacity. The most \nsignificant economic benefit will come from increases in future earnings of better educated school \ngraduates.  Capacity  building  assistance  for  MECS  in  areas  related  to  financial  analysis, \nmanagement,  and  budgeting  will  help  to  improve  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  the  delivery  of \neducation services and will reduce transaction costs. Public expenditure on education as a share \nof  gross  domestic  product  is  projected  to  average  6.5%  in  the  period  2009\u20132012.  It  can  be \nassumed that the budget will be sufficient to continue education service delivery at the current rate \nand to finance the modernization of the system. The Government\u2019s share in the Project is included \n\n \n\n\f17\n\nin the budget. Based on a projection of education expenditure, it can be assumed that the Project \nis financially sustainable (Appendix 3 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n55. \nPoverty Reduction and Social Dimensions. Poverty and education are strongly related, \nand better education services are an important contribution to human and economic development. \nOne  of  the  most  persistent  issues  in  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  is  a  rural\u2013urban  gap  in \neducation  quality,  educational  achievement,  school  participation,  and  dropout  rates.  Children  in \nrural  areas  tend  to  be  left  out  of  upper  secondary  schooling  because of  a  combination  of  lack  of \naccess and limited household funds. Poverty contributes to dropout rates directly, through out-of-\npocket  and  opportunity  costs,  and  indirectly,  through  parental  background.  Rural  students  who \ntend to perform worse and drop out after the 8th grade are highly likely to be poor. High dropout \nrates  reinforce  the  vicious  cycle  of  inter-generational  transmission  of  poverty.  Dropout  rates  for \nboys at secondary level are high among poor families in urban areas while, in rural areas, children \ndrop out even at primary level. Specific pro-poor and social development measures of the Project \ninclude lower education costs for parents and greater use of ICT as a teaching and learning tool, \nparticularly  in  rural  schools.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  support  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to \nimprove the existing system to reduce urban\u2013rural disparities. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 8. According to the ADB and World Bank Mongolia country gender \nassessment  (2005),20  schoolgirls  outnumber  schoolboys  in  every  aimag,  including  Ulaanbaatar. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  all  teachers  through  its  training  programs,  which  are  expected  to \nenhance  the  attractiveness  of  the  teaching  profession.  Over  90%  of  teachers  are  female  so  the \nProject will encourage more men to work as basic education teachers. This will enable children to \nbroaden  their  role  models,  which  is  particularly  important  given  the  poor  school  attendance  and \nhigher dropout rates of boys. The Project will also help to present gender roles and issues under \nthe  PSTT  component.  The  gender  action  plan  is  in  Appendix  9.  More  generally,  the  Project  will \nencourage  parents  to  send  their  children  to  school  through  the  provision  of  textbooks,  more \nqualified teachers, and lower costs for parents.  \n \n56. \nEthnic Minority Issues. Kazakhs are the most significant ethnic minority in Mongolia and \naccounted for 4.4% of the total population in 2002. They retain a distinct cultural identity, which is \nrecognized under Article 8 of the Mongolian Constitution, which allows Kazakhs to use their native \nlanguage  in  education,  communication,  and  the  pursuit  of  cultural  and  scientific  activities.  At  the \nsame  time,  Kazakhs  practice  a  pastoral,  nomadic  lifestyle  similar  to  the  ethnic  majority  Khalk  in \nrural  areas.  Basic  education  and  literacy  rates  are  similar  across  ethnic  groups,  although  some \ndifferences  in  levels  of  secondary  school  attendance  are  beginning  to  emerge.  Geographical \nisolation  and  poverty  appear  to  affect  ethnic  minorities\u2019  educational  attainment  rather  than  their \nmembership  of  a  minority  culture.  Improvements  in  educational  provision  under  the  Project  will \ntherefore  be  similar  for  ethnic  minorities  and  the  Khalk  majority.  The  Project  will  (i)  support \ntranslation of textbook and educational software into the Kazakh language; and (ii) select at least \none school in Bayan-Olgiy aimag for the ICT subcomponent, as reflected in the gender action plan, \nin Appendix 9. \n \n57. \nEnvironmental  Aspects.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  existing  TTI  buildings  and  facilities. \nNo land acquisition is required and there will be no negative environmental or resettlement impact. \nThe Project is classified as category C for the environmental aspect. \n \n58. \nunlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy.  \n \nProject Assumptions. The major project assumptions are (i) favorable economic growth in \n59. \nMongolia; (ii) continued funding and support of education by the Government; and (iii) acceptance \n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  With  no  planned  land  acquisition,  the  Project  is \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB and World Bank. 2005. Mongolia: Country Gender Assessment. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nof  policy  and  legislative  changes  by  decision  makers,  key  stakeholders,  and  the  community  at \nlarge.  Other  assumptions  include:  (i)  staff  trained  under  the  Project  will  remain  in  the  education \nsystem  after  their  qualifications  have  been  upgraded;  and  (ii)  an  improved  curriculum,  better \nteachers, and lower costs for parents will increase enrollment and attendance rates. \n \nRisks and Mitigation Measures. At present, managerial and technical capacity at MECS \n60. \nis  limited  and  this  may  affect  the  smooth  transition  to  a  12-year  school  system.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated  through  training  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project.  High  turnover  of  officials  and \nsenior staff in key agencies resulting in slow progress or resistance of reforms is also a risk. The \nrisk  of  high  turnover  of  officials  will  be  mitigated  through  government  assurances  that  confirm  its \ncommitment  to  education  reforms  and  by  adopting  a  stakeholder  participatory  approach  and \nbuilding  core  technical  and  management  capacity  in  MECS  through  the  Project  and  the  ADB-\nfunded  SWAp  TA.  Allegations  of  corruption  in  the  selection  and  procurement  of  textbooks, \nincluding the approval, publishing, and distribution of textbooks may pose another risk. However, \nthis  will  be  mitigated  through  training  and  consultative  workshops  with  key  stakeholders  and  by \ncapacity building under the Project.    \n \n\nV.    ASSURANCES \n\n \n61. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  all  necessary  counterpart \nfor  project \nimplementation  on  time.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual \nbudgetary  appropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriate \nfunds during each year of project implementation. \n\nfunds \n\n(ii)  Within  2  years  of  grant  effectiveness,  MECS  will  have  developed,  approved,  and \nintroduced a new PSTT curriculum. The Government will ensure that all curricula in \nthe  five  TTIs  will  conform  to  the  same  program  standards  and  will  not  vary  in \nstructure. \n\n(iii)  Within  2  years  of  grant  effectiveness,  MECS  will  have  approved  budgeting  and \nplanning reforms, including its related MIS and have prepared a time-bound action \nplan  for  these  reforms,  and  that  by  the  midterm  review,  implementation  has \nprogressed to full institutionalization of these reforms.  \n\n(iv)  Within 6 months of the effectiveness of the Grant Agreement, the Government will \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nensure that the PPMS will have been established. \nThe Government will ensure that (a) evaluation, selection, and performance criteria \nfor bidders and contractors respectively have been clearly identified in a consultative \nmanner and rigorously applied; (b) tender and evaluation committee members have \nappropriate  procurement,  professional,  or  technical  qualifications  or  experience  to \nevaluate the tenders and have been provided with relevant and appropriate training \nin  evaluation  techniques;  (c)  inspection  and  supervision  of  contractor  performance \nwill  be  strengthened  and  only  products/works  that  fulfill  the  contract  requirements \nwill  be  accepted;  and  (d)  the  anticorruption  action  plan  and  codes  of  ethics  and \nintegrity are  developed and implemented. \nThe Government will ensure that the Project will be implemented in accordance with \nthe gender action plan. \nBy the end of the second year of project implementation, MECS will have developed \na 5-year strategy and policy for ICT in education and relevant authorities will have \napproved such a plan. The approved plan will include clear budgetary allocations for \nthe total costs of ownership of ICT hardware investments in the education sector. By \nthe end of the second year of project implementation, MECS will have developed a \n\n \n\n\f19\n\ntime-bound  action  plan  for  implementation  of  the  ICT  strategy  in  the  education \nsector. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  By the end of the first year of project implementation, MECS will have developed a \ntime-bound  action  plan  for  enhancing  textbook  production  and  provision,  by  the \nsecond  year,  MECS  will  have  commenced  implementation  of  the  action  plan  for \nenhancing textbook production and provision based on the pilot system, and within \nthe  6  months  after  the  pilot  implementation  for  the  textbook  enhancement  is \ncompleted, MECS will have evaluated the pilot project. Based on the results of the \npilot  implementation  of  the  textbook  rental  scheme  and  revolving  funds,  the  pilot \nshall  be  scaled  up  if  successful;  or  revised  for  further  pilot  implementation;  or  if \nunsuccessful, alternative solutions may be considered. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  disbursements  will  be  made  based  on  achieving \nmilestones in the Project, such as establishment of the textbook rental scheme and \nrevolving  funds  trust  fund  for  the  textbook  provision  and  the  approval  of  the  ICT \nnational policy for the ICT subcomponent. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  an  appropriate  management  authority  is \nestablished  as  for  the  pilot  textbook  rental  scheme  and  revolving  funds.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  appropriate  legal  charters  and  operational  rules  and \nregulations  are  established  for  the  operation  of  the  textbook  rental  scheme  and \nrevolving funds. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  resources  for  training  supplies  and \nmaterials,  and  repair  and  O&M  of  facilities  and  equipment  are  made  available  to \nproject-supported  public  PSTT \nthe  project \nimplementation period. \nThe  Recipient  shall  ensure  that  adequate  budget  be  provided  to  the  schools  for \nelectricity,  access  to  the  Internet,  and  other  basic  infrastructure  to  operate  ICT \nfacilities and training equipment provided under the Project. \n\nthroughout  and  after \n\ninstitutions \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\nVI.  \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n62. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $10,000,000 to Mongolia from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Education \nSector Reform Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \n\nPresident \n\n \n28 October 2008 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nImproved quality, \naccess, efficiency, \nand effectiveness \nof the education \nsector \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOutcome \nEffective 12-year \neducation system  \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n \nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\n \n\u2022 Gross enrollment rate among school age \npopulation maintained at 95% and net \nenrollment rate increased from 89.9% in \n2007 to 95% by 2015 \n\n\u2022 Improved performance on assessment \n\nexams for graduates from TTIs (baseline \ndata to be established) by 2015 \n\n\u2022 Improved financial policies in schools, \nresulting in increased recurrent budget \nallocations and capital investment \n(baseline data collected during the project \npreparatory TA) by 2015 \n\n\u2022 Parental costs of education reduced by \n\n15% in real terms (baseline data collected \nduring the project preparatory TA) by 2015 \n\n \n \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \n\u2022 National statistics  \n\u2022 MECS baseline \nand/or research \nstudies on \nenrollment, grade \nprogression, school \ngraduation, \ntextbook provision, \nand pre-service \nteacher training \n\n\u2022 Progress reports on \n\nMillennium \nDevelopment Goals \n\u2022 School surveys and \nparent focus groups \ncollected during the \nproject preparatory \nTA \n\n \n\u2022 Enrollment of 6-year-olds increased from \n\n \n\u2022 MECS annual \n\n75% in 2008 to 95% by 2014 \n\n\u2022 Student transition from lower to upper \n\nsecondary education increased from 81% \nin 2003 to 85% by 2014 \n\n\u2022 Transition from grade 11 to grade 12 \n\nincreased to 60% by 2014 (baseline data \nto be collected in 2009) \n\n\u2022 Completion rates of boys in  secondary \n\neducation increased from 45% in 2007 to \n65% by 2014 \n\nreports generated \nthrough EMIS \n\n\u2022 Grade 10 national \n\nexamination results \npublished by MECS \n\n\u2022 Grade 12 \n\nexamination results \npublished by MECS \n\nOutputs \n1.

According \n1. \nto  Clause  7.2  of  the  Law  on  Education,  with  effect  from  school  year  (SY)  2008\u20132009,  the \nsystem will move to a 12-year school system, and the school entry age will be lowered from 7 to \n6  years.  About  43,000  6-year-olds  are  expected  to  join  the  formal  education  system  in  2008. \nPrimary and lower secondary education is compulsory. Primary education will include grades 1\u2013\n6.  Lower  secondary  education  will  include  grades  7\u201310  and  upper  secondary  education  will \ninclude grades 11\u201312. The Constitution stipulates free basic education to all children. \n \nOnly  half  of  Mongolian  children  receive  any  form  of  early  childhood  education1  and \n2. \nenrollment of children in rural areas and children from herder families in preschool programs is \nparticularly  low.  In  2006,  58.1%  of  children  2\u20136  years  of  age  were  enrolled  in  preschools  and \nkindergartens.  In  2007\u20132008,  92.7%  of  the  primary  school  age  group  was  enrolled  in  primary \nschools.  Secondary  education  enrollment  was  86.8%.  Net  enrollment  rate  for  primary  and \nsecondary education was 89.9%. \n \n3. \nIn  SY2007\u20132008  there  were  754  general  education  schools  in  Mongolia  with  a  total \n542,505  students.  According  to  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science  (MECS)  statistics \nthere were 23,778 teachers employed in general education schools, of which 22,891 were full \ntime  teachers.  The  average  teacher  to  student  ratio  is  25.5.2  The  shortage  of  teachers  in \nSY2006\u20132007  was  479  with  the  highest  number  of  vacancies  in  Ulaanbaatar  schools.  Of  the \n754  general  education  schools  in  SY2007\u20132008,  210  were  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  the  remainder \nschools were located in aimags. Of the total, 71 schools were primary only, 167 were grades 1\u2013\n10,  and  516  were  grade  1\u201311.  Most  schools  taught  in  Mongolian,  although  in  Bayan-Olgiy \nschools offered instruction in the Kazakh language. \n \n4. \n A total of 495 boarding schools enrolled 44,037 students in SY2007\u20132008 (about 8% of \nthe overall student population), of which 38,255 were herders\u2019 children. Overall, 51,118 students \nwere willing to live in dormitories, although demand exceeded supply and many students were \nforced to live in rented accommodation or with relatives in order to attend school. \n \n5. \nMECS administers vocational education and training and the Ministry of Social Welfare \nand  Labor  administers  short  courses  that  offer  vocational  and  specialization  certificates. \nAccording  to  MECS  statistics,  in  SY2007\u20132008,  there  were  56  technical  and  vocational \ninstitutions, with a total of 29,906 students, of whom 13,835 were female. In primary vocational \ninstitutions  29,109  students  were  enrolled,  of  whom  13,498  were  female.  In  secondary \nvocational institutions 797 students were enrolled, of whom 337 were female. \n \n6. \nIn academic year 2007\u20132008, there were 162 higher education institutions in Mongolia \ncomprising  43  state-owned  higher  education  institutions  and  four  state-owned  vocational \neducation and training centers, 109 private institutions, and six branches of foreign universities. \nStudent  enrollments  have  tripled  from  about  33,000  to  over  150,000  since  the  withdrawal  of \nSoviet  financial  support  in  1991.  Over  the  last  3  years  about  66%  of  students  were  in  state-\n\n                                                 \n1  Nettleton,  Steve.  2007.

The  gender  differential  in  both  state  and  private \ninstitutions has not changed, with 61% of students being female. The percentage of women in \nstate institutions has remained constant at about 60%.  \n\n \n\nChallenges and Constraints in the Education System \n\nB. \n \n7. \nMongolia began a standards-based curriculum reform in 1998 and began standardized \ntesting a year later. Secondary education standards were introduced in 2003. These emphasize \nthe importance of comprehensive skills\u2014learning to know, learning to perform, and learning to \nsocialize.  General  subject  areas  include  science  and  technology  and  English.  While  these \nstandards  are  consistent  with  the  acquisition  of  skills  that  are  needed  for  work  and  life,  the \ncurrent curriculum and teaching practices are not very consistent with these goals.  \n \n8. \nThe school curriculum and teaching methods have not kept up with the new demands in \nthe  labor  market.  The  curriculum  continues  to  be  too  theoretical  and  is  focused  on  traditional \nacademic  subjects,  while  teaching  continues  to  be  teacher-centered  rather  than  interactive.  It \nencourages memorization rather than critical and creative thinking and individual learning rather \nthan teamwork. While information and communications technology (ICT) and English language \nsubjects  are  part  of  the  curriculum,  teachers  are  generally  not  well  prepared  to  teach  these \nsubjects. In many cases, the teaching of ICT is limited by the poor availability of computers in \nschools and inadequate operational budgets. The teaching of thinking and behavioral skills can \nbe integrated into every aspect of the curriculum through discovery-oriented teaching methods \nthat include interactive learning, applying knowledge to real-life problems, integrating teamwork \nand  peer  tutoring  into  the  learning  process,  and  inviting  student  input  into  the  structure  and \nsubject  matter  of  lessons.  However,  these  methodologies  require  trained  teachers  and \nadequate  classroom  facilities  to  make  them  effective  in  terms  of  delivery  new  educational \noutputs. \n \nThe  implementation  of  student-centered  learning  will  take  time  and  require  substantial \n9. \ninvestments  in  pre-  and  in-service  training.  In  the  short  run,  teaching  life  skills  as  a  separate \nsubject  (e.g.,  health,  citizenship,  or  financial  literacy  education)  may  be  a  practical  option.  To \nimprove  teaching,  teachers  also  should  have  adequate  materials  and  should  conduct  routine \nassessments of student progress, focusing on their ability to use the knowledge acquired. The \nGovernment is currently developing such a national assessment system for primary education.  \n \n10. \nRationalizing  Education  Sector  Facilities.  A  systematic  restructuring  of  education \ninstitutions was undertaken under the ADB-funded Education Sector Development Project. This \naimed  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  cost-effectiveness  of  the  education  system  during  the \n1990s,  the  most  severe  period  of  transition.  In  the  mid-1990s  school  attendance  was  poor, \nmany  schools  were  dysfunctional,  and  teachers  were  not  paid  for  months  (at  that  time  the \nmaximum monthly salary was MNT24,500).3 A nationwide school mapping study was completed \nin  April  1997  and  a  plan  was  prepared  for  comprehensive  school  rationalization.  Of  the  171 \nschools identified for restructuring, 136 (80%) were restructured by August 1998 and 35 (20%) \nwere  restructured  by  June  2002.  One  of  the  major  outputs  was  the  development  of  \u201ccomplex \nschools,\u201d  a  rationalization  initiative  that  brought  several  adjacent  neighborhood  schools  under \ncommon management. In 2007, about 20% of students and 21% of teachers and school service \nstaff of Ulaanbaatar were in complex schools. The model is now considered to be a blueprint for \nthe development of primary and secondary education services in urban areas, as these schools \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

At  the  same  time,  rural  students  do  not  have  equal  access  to  upper  secondary \neducation.  A  number  of  rural  schools  closed  their  upper  secondary  classes  during  the  school \nreorganization  and  rationalization  reform  in  1997,  while  aimag  complex  schools  have  only \nlimited  numbers  of  upper  secondary  spaces.  An  assessment  of  the  outcomes  from  the \nrationalization and reorganization reform suggests that these reforms may have perpetuated the \nwidening gaps in educational outcomes between urban (aimag center and capital city) and rural \n(soum and bagh) schools, exacerbated the problems of access to senior secondary education, \nand possibly contributed to migration from rural areas.  \n \n11. \nTeacher Training Institutes. The Mongolian State University of Education (MSUE), the \nMongolian National University, the University of Social Sciences, and four teachers colleges are \nthe  major  teacher  training  institutes  (TTIs)  of  Mongolia.  In  rural  areas  there  are  universities  in \nKhovd,  Bayan-Olgiy,  Arkhangai,  and  Dornod  aimags.  These  universities  and  colleges  prepare \nabout  2,800  teachers  annually  and  over  40%  of  them  will  continue  to  offer  teacher  training  in \nearly  childhood  education,  primary  and  secondary  schools,  and  the  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  sector.  The  MSUE  is  the  largest  TTI  in  Mongolia.  It  consists  of  12 \nschools and four teacher training colleges.4 Two TTIs are in Ulaanbaatar; one trains teachers for \nprimary schools and the other specializes in preschool education. MSUE is the only institution \nthat covers all levels of teacher training including preschool, primary and secondary education, \nand  higher  education.  Currently  8,000  students  are  enrolled  in  MSUE,  of  whom  600  are  in \nmaster  programs  and  300  in  doctoral  programs.  MSUE  employs  450  lecturers  and  200  non-\nteaching staff. About 50% of faculty members hold advanced academic and scientific degrees. \nMSUE offers 4-year bachelor programs in more then 50 specializations. About 70% of teachers \ncurrently working in primary and secondary schools are MSUE graduates. MSUE and two of the \nteacher  training  colleges  annually  produce  about  1,400  graduates,  about  50%  of  the  total \nnumber  of  teacher  graduates  from  TTIs  in  Mongolia.  The  Preschool  Teacher  Training  College \ncurrently has 952 students and 26 teaching staff. It offers a 2-year course called Teacher and \nMethodologist. About 100 students graduate every year, and according to the management of \nthe TTI, 70% of them continue with a teaching career.  \n \n12. \nThere  is  a  decreasing  interest  in  teacher  training  courses  in  the  TTIs  outside \nUlaanbaatar, which now have problems in recruiting sufficient numbers of students to continue \nrunning  teacher  training  courses.  As  a  result,  provision  of  teacher  education  programs  is  no \nlonger considered to be a profitable or sustainable business.  \n \nVocational  Education.  Vocational education  does  not  yet  serve  the  real  needs  of the \n13. \nlabor  market.  Upper  secondary  and  tertiary  education  need  to  accommodate  diverse  student \nneeds,  interests,  and  capabilities.  Vocational  education  therefore  should  be  part  of  a  diverse \nsystem  of  learning  options.  Vocational  education  can  be  accessed  after  completing  lower \nsecondary  or  upper  secondary,  while  technical  education  requires  an  upper  secondary \neducation.  Vocational  and  technical  education  in  Mongolia  accounts  for  only  9%  of  total \nenrollment in post-basic education, which reflects the heavy bias of post-basic education toward \nacademic  university  degrees.  The  system  also  needs  sufficient  flexibility  to  allow  students  to \nexperiment  and  develop  their  full  potential.  While  technical  education  is  fully  integrated  with \nhigher education, vocational education in Mongolia has no connection with technical colleges or \nthe academic education track (secondary and higher education). \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Originally,  five  teacher  training  colleges  were  attached  to  MSUE  but  the  TTI  in  Dornod  has  now  become  an \n\nindependent HEI.  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nNew 12-Year Education Structure \n\nHigher Education. Currently, higher education institutions do not fully serve the needs \n14. \nof  the  knowledge  economy.  Universities  have  been  subject  to  an  accreditation  system  since \n1998,  but  this  system  is  not  obligatory  and  is  considered  to  be  weak  in  terms  of  the \nassessments  performed.  In  addition  to  introducing  more  student-centered  teaching  practices \nand  more  practical  programs,  the  higher  education  system  needs  to  be  more  flexible.  Open \nsystems  can  facilitate  student  mobility  by  recognizing  relevant  prior  experience,  degree \nequivalences,  and  credits  earned  elsewhere.  A  well-designed  and  unified  system  of  higher \neducation  admission  tests  is  beneficial,  because  educating  the  most  capable  students  can \nfoster innovation, thus driving reforms and progress in the economy. \n \nC. \n \nThe new 12-year education structure was introduced into schools in September 2008. It \n15. \nreplaced the previous 11-year structure, which itself was introduced only in 2005. The new 12-\nyear structure will bring Mongolia in line with an increasing number of former socialist countries \nwho are now opting for 12-year systems. \n \n16. \nThe  new  12-year  system  poses  a  number  of  challenges  for  the  education  system  in \nMongolia.  For  example,  there  are  many  who  complain  that  the  system  has  not  yet  properly \nadjusted to the introduction of the 11-year system in 2005 and that introducing a 12-year system \nin 2008 may be too hasty. The many problems that need to be resolved include the following.   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nlavatory  and  washing \n\nThe  need  to  provide  additional  classroom,  kitchen,  and  dormitory  facilities  that \nare  both  age-  and  gender-sensitive.  Because  the  education  structure  will  be \nexpanded  downwards  and  6-year-olds  will  be  accepted  into  primary  schools  for \nthe  first  time,  there  is  a  need  to  provide  additional  classroom  and  dormitory \nspace  plus  chairs,  desks,  shelving,  and \nfacilities \nappropriate to the age and size of the children concerned. \nThe  enrollment  of  young  children  (7-year-olds  from  2005  and  6-year-olds  from \n2008) requires a substantial program of both in-service and pre-service teacher \ntraining to prepare teachers with new skills in (a) early childhood education and \nthe  development  of  early  literacy  in  particular,  (b)  the  demands  of  the  new  12-\nyear  curriculum,  (c)  new  teaching  methods  and  approaches  to  deliver  the  new \nmethodological approaches specified as part of the new curriculum, and (d) the \nachievement of new skills and competency based learning outputs.  \nThe  12-year  system  requires  the  previous  curriculum  to  be  amended  to \naccommodate 6-year-olds. Teacher training is dependent upon the availability of \nthe new curriculum.   \nNew  learning  and  teaching  materials  and  supplementary  reading  books  are  all \nrequired and have to be written and delivered on schedule. \n\n \nD.  \n\nFinancing of Education \n\n1. \n\nEconomic and Budget Forecasts \n\n17. \nBest  practices  in  transitional  economies  have  indicated  that  expenditure  for  the \neducation  sector  ranges  between  4%  and  8%  of  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and \nbetween  10%  and  20%  of  total  public  expenditure.  Using  these  comparative  indicators, \nMongolia  can  be  regarded  as  having  paid  significant  attention  to  its  education  sector.  Actual \neducation  sector  expenditure  accounted  for  5.1%  of  total  national  GDP  in  2006  and  4.9%  in \n2007. It accounted for 15.3% of total public expenditure in 2006 and 13.4% in 2007. Education \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nexpenditure increased from  MNT189 billion in 2006 to MNT234 billion in 2007 (an increase of \n24%), see Table A2.1. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Education Budget Expenditure (Historic, Planned, and Projected) \n\nHistoric \n\nPlanned \n\nProject Implementation \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n3,715 \n\n4,807 \n\nYear 0 \n2008 \n\n5,779 \n\nYear 1 \n2009 \n\n6,644 \n\nYear 2 \n2010 \n\n9,543 \n\nYear 3 \n2011 \n\n11,231 \n\nYear 4 \n2012 \n\nYear 5 \n2013 \n\nYear 6 \n2014 \n\n12,915 \n\n14,853 \n\n17,080 \n\n33.6 \n\n29.39 \n\n20.22 \n\n14.96 \n\n35.65 \n\n17.68 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n1,237 \n\n1,749 \n\n2,564 \n\n2,476 \n\n3,167 \n\n3,598 \n\n3,875 \n\n4,456 \n\n5,124 \n\n33.3 \n\n36.4 \n\n44.4 \n\n37.3 \n\n33.2 \n\n32.0 \n\n30.00 \n\n30.00 \n\n30.00 \n\n189 \n\n5.1 \n\n234 \n\n4.9 \n\n386 \n\n425 \n\n467 \n\n514 \n\n646 \n\n743 \n\n854 \n\n6.7 \n\n6.4 \n\n4.9 \n\n4.6 \n\n5 \n\n5 \n\n5 \n\n15.3 \n\n13.4 \n\n15.1 \n\n17.2 \n\n14.7 \n\n14.3 \n\n16.7 \n\n16.7 \n\n16.7 \n\nExpenditure \nGDP in Current \nPrices (MNT billion) \n\nGDP Growth Rate  \n(% nominal) \nPublic Expenditure  \n(MNT billion) \nPublic Expenditure as \n% of GDP \n\nEducation Sector \nBudget (MNT billion) \n\nEducation Sector \nBudget as % of GDP \n\nEducation Sector \nBudget as % of Public \nExpenditure \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on Ministry of Finance data.  \n\n \n18. \nBased  on  the  current  economic  outlook,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  submitted \nthe national 2008 budget to the parliament, which has approved it. The budget for the education \nsector in 2008 is MNT386 billion, accounting for 15.1% of total public expenditure and 6.7% of \nnational  GDP.  Discussions  with  the  MOF  indicated  that  the  budget  was  based  on  the \nassumption  that  (i)  prices  of  copper  and  gold  in  international  markets  will  remain  high,  and  \n(ii) the nominal GDP growth rate will be 20.2% at year-end 2008. \n \nFor  the  proposed  period  of  implementation  of  the  Education  Sector  Reform  Project \n19. \n(assuming  4  years  between  2009  and  2013)  and  thereafter  (2014\u20132021),  a  nominal  annual \nGDP  growth  rate  of  15.0%  has  been  assumed by  the  project  preparatory  TA  team  in  order  to \nestimate the national nominal GDP, while local economists and policy makers revealed that they \nwould  be  more  optimistic.  Based  on  this  assumption,  education  sector  expenditure  would \nremain at an acceptable and maintainable level, at about 5% of national GDP and in the range \nof 14.3%\u201317.2% of total public expenditure during and after project implementation (See Tables \nA2.2 and A2.3). \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nExpenditure \nGDP in Current Prices  \n(MNT billion) \nGDP Growth Rate  \n(% nominal) \nPublic Expenditure  \n(MNT billion) \nPublic  Expenditure  as  %  of \nGDP \n\nEducation  Sector  Budget \n(MNT billion) \n\nEducation  Sector  Budget \nas % of GDP \n\nEducation  Sector  Budget \nas % of Public Expenditure \n\nTable A2.2: Education Budget Expenditure (Post-Project Implementation) \n\nPost-Project Implementation \n\nYear 7 \n2015 \n\n19,643 \n\nYear 8 \n2016 \n\n22,589 \n\nYear 9 \n2017 \n\n25,977 \n\nYear 10 \n2018 \n\nYear 11 \n2019 \n\nYear 12 \n2020 \n\nYear 13 \n2021 \n\n29,874 \n\n34,355 \n\n39,508 \n\n45,434 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n15 \n\n6,089 \n\n7,916 \n\n10,291 \n\n13,378 \n\n17,391 \n\n22,609 \n\n29,391 \n\n30 \n\n982 \n\n5 \n\n30 \n\n30 \n\n30 \n\n30 \n\n30 \n\n30 \n\n827 \n\n910 \n\n1,001 \n\n1,101 \n\n1,211 \n\n1,333 \n\n5 \n\n5 \n\n16.1 \n\n10.4 \n\n8.8 \n\n5 \n\n7.5 \n\n5 \n\n6.3 \n\n5 \n\n5.4 \n\n5 \n\n4.5 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the Ministry of Finance\u2019s 2008 draft budget. \n\n \n\n20. \nRecentralization  of  Education  Financing.  The  Government  recentralized  education \nfinancing in 2002. The tasks of consolidating school budgets and preparing the sector\u2019s budget \nproposal were assigned to MECS, and budget disbursement was assigned to MOF, through a \nnewly  created  treasury  office.  As  a  result  of  these  changes,  education  finance  officers  were \nappointed  as  provincial  representatives  of  the  Economics  and  Finance  Department  of  MECS, \nbased  at  aimag  education  and  culture  departments.  Treasury  officers  from  MOF  were \ntransferred to aimag treasury offices. In addition, schools were allowed to have only one budget \naccount  to  which  the  aimag  treasury  offices  would  have  direct  access.  The  purpose  of  this \nreform was to simplify processes and increase transparency in school accounting. \n \n21. \nRecentralization has not occurred in one-third of schools (those in Ulaanbaatar). This is \ninconsistent with the law, which was meant to restructure education financing nationally. While \nin other aimags, MECS and MOF provincial staff have separate roles in budget preparation and \ndisbursement respectively, the treasury office in Ulaanbaatar still performs both functions. As a \nresult,  the  treasury  office  submits  aggregate  information  on  school  budgets  directly  to  MECS. \nUnlike the provincial offices, the treasury office in Ulaanbaatar is accountable to the office of the \nmayor  (rather  than  to  MECS  or  MOF).  Schools  in  Ulaanbaatar  are  also  waived  from  applying \nthe  revised  school  funding  formula.  The  case  of  Ulaanbaatar  is  less  a  problem  of  education \nfinance and more of accountability and control. The chances of leaks are greater in a system in \nwhich approval and disbursement are administered by the same agency, and where there are \nno uniform processes of monitoring and evaluation in place.  \n \n22. \nSchools  prepare  3-year  budget  strategies  in  the  spring  of  every  year,  and  submit  a \ndetailed budget proposal based on the current fiscal year\u2019s budget norms to the finance officer \nof  the  aimag  Education  and  Culture  Department  by  1  July  every  year.  The  requirement  for  3-\nyear  budget  proposals  to  be  submitted  by  schools  is  likely  to  be  removed  because  it  is \nconsidered  to  be  unrealistic.  Discussions  with  MOF  and  MECS  officials  revealed  that  school \nprincipals  and  accountants  need  to  be  trained  to  prepare  these  budgets  and  to  receive  a \nrefresher course every 2 years. In particular, they need to be trained to account for both variable \nand  fixed  costs  in  the  school  expenditure  line  items.  In  July  of  each  year,  all  finance  officers \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nmeet for 2 weeks in the finance office of MECS in Ulaanbaatar to prepare budget proposals in \nthe  official  format.  At  this  stage,  and  based  on  student  numbers,  reallocations  may  occur, \naffecting how the budget is distributed between variable and fixed costs. School budgets for the \nfollowing fiscal year are based on budget norms formulated in the fourth quarter of the previous \nyear.  Since  the  budget  norms  are  adjusted  upwards  annually,  overall  budgets  for  schools \nprepared at the central level are often higher than those submitted by the Education and Culture \nDepartment finance officers.  \n \n\n2. \n\nApproved 2008 Budget \n\n23. \nThe expenditure on education, culture, and science in 2008 was approved at MNT386.6 \nbillion,  an  increase  of  MNT151.8  billion  or  65%  compared  with  2007.  Of  this  amount,  17% \n(MNT64.3 billion) is for preschool education, 48% (MNT185.4 billion) for general education, 7% \n(MNT27.7  billion)  for  vocational  education,  10%  (MNT39.5  billion)  for  higher  education,  6% \n(MNT23.4  billion)  for  culture  and  arts,  3%  (MNT12.8  billion)  for  science,  and  9%  (MNT33.4 \nbillion) for other educational organizations (Table A2.3).  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Budget Composition of the Education, Culture, and Science Sector \n\n2006 (actual) \n\n2007 (actual) \n\n2008 (approved) \n\nSubsector \nNursing schools \nKindergartens \nGeneral education schools \nVocational training centers \nUniversities and colleges \nOther educational organizations \nCulture and arts organizations \nScientific organizations \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n\n519.4 \n29,177.5 \n96,447.6 \n8,791.7 \n24,633.9 \n21,293.0 \n11,289.0 \n6,679.5 \n198,831.6 \n\n693.6 \n39,778.0 \n119,792.6 \n15,110.2 \n0.0 \n36,071.5 \n15,645.5 \n7,706.4 \n234,797.8 \n\n64,345.2 \n\n185,397.1 \n27,761.2 \n39,491.6 \n33,391.7 \n23,482.7 \n12,816.7 \n386,686.2 \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Implications of the 12-Year General Education Structure  \n\n24. \nAs  from  SY2008\u20132009,  according  to  Clause  7.2  of  the  Law  on  Education,  MECS  will \nshift  from  the  11-year  school  system  to  a  12-year  system,  with  the  enrollment  of  6-year-old \nchildren  into  grade  1.  This  will  require  additional  finance  to  cover  building  of  schools, \ndormitories,  classroom  and  dormitory  furniture,  and  related  facilities;  training  teachers;  and \nprinting more textbooks and teaching materials. Operational costs for schools (both variable and \nfixed) are also expected to increase. \n \n25. \nBecause MECS financial projections were not made available to the project preparatory \nTA team, a rough estimation of the incremental cost of moving to a 12-year system is outlined in \nTable A2.4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n \nNo. \n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n4 \n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\nNumber of \nClassrooms to be Built \nNumber of Table and \nChair Sets \nDormitory Rooms \nDormitory Beds \nToilets (for school and \ndormitories) \nSinks (for school and \ndormitories) \nTeacher Training \nCosts \nTextbooks (for socially \ntargeted groups) \nTeaching Manuals for \nTeachers \n\nTable A2.4: Estimates of Incremental Costs of Moving to a \n12-Year School System (2008\u20132015) \n\n \n \nItems \n\n \n \nUnit \nRoom \n\n \n \nQuantity \n\nUnit \nCost \n($) \n\n1,107  7,000 \n\n \n2008\u2013\n2009a \n7,752 \n\n \n2009\u2013\n2010 \n\n \n2010\u2013\n2011 \n\n \n2011\u2013\n2012 \n\n \n2012\u2013\n2013 \n\n \n2013\u2013\n2014 \n388 \n\n \n2014\u2013\n2015 \n\nSet \n\n43,029 \n\n50 \n\n2,151 \n\nRoom \nBed \nToilet \n\n1,312  7,000 \n100 \n6,504 \n60 \n3,422 \n\n9,184 \n650 \n205 \n\nSink \n\n3,554 \n\n60 \n\n213 \n\nTeacher \n\n738  3,000 \n\n2,213 \n\n17,212 \n\n1,229 \n\n15 \n\n50 \n\n258 \n\n61 \n\nSet \n\nSet \n\n% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n459 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10  Operational Costs \n(variable and fixed \ncosts) \n\nAnnual Incremental Costs ($\u2019000) \nAnnual Incremental Cost (MNT million) \n\na One-off. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n22 \n\n \n\n4,978 \n\n4,978 \n\n4,978 \n\n4,978 \n\n4,978 \n\n5,825 \n\n4,978 \n\n \n \n\n  27,667 \n  32,370 \n\n4,978 \n5,824 \n\n4,978 \n5,824 \n\n4,978 \n5,824 \n\n4,978 \n5,824 \n\n6,672 \n7,806 \n\n4,978 \n5,824 \n\n \n26. \nIt is forecast that in SY2008\u20132009, grade I enrollment will be 68,803, including 43,029  \n6-year-old  children  and  25,774  7-year-old  children.  The  43,029  6-year-old  children  will  need \n1,229 classrooms and 1,229 teachers, based on the MECS target of 35 pupils per class and per \nteacher. The public investment program is financing the construction of 122 classrooms in 2008. \nThe  remaining  1,107  classrooms  will  need  to  be  constructed  at  a  unit  cost  of  $7,000  per \nclassroom. It is estimated that only 40% of the 1,229 teachers needed are readily available for \n6-year-old pupils in 2008. The other 60% (738 teachers) will need to be trained at an average \ncost per teacher of $3,000. It is assumed that 40% of the 6-year-old children will be from poor \nand  disadvantaged  households  will  therefore  be  provided  with  books  at  the  Government's \nexpenses. The cost of items such as dormitory rooms, beds, and sinks were estimated as per \ndiscussions with MECS and validated by market data. Incremental operational costs, including \nvariable  and  fixed  costs,  were  estimated  at  22%  of  the  total  2008  one-off  incremental  costs, \nbased on historic cost. \n \n27. \nThe  projections  were  made  from  2008  to  2015,  the  end  of  the  transitional  period.  The \ntotal  incremental  cost  of  shifting  to  the  12-year  system  is  estimated  to  be  $27.7  million \n(MNT32.4  billion),  including  $22.7  million  as  an  incremental  one-off  cost  and  $4.9  million  as \nincremental  operational  costs  for  2008.  The  incremental  operational  costs  are  projected  to \nremain  unchanged  in  most  of  the  other  years,  except  that  for  SY2013\u20132014  when  capital \nreplacement costs are included for classrooms and dormitories that will have been in operation \nfor 5 years. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  Transition to \n\n12-year \ncompulsory \neducation \nsystem \n\n\u2022  Need to reflect \nthe new state \neducation \nstandards and \nthe curriculum \nin the teaching \nand learning  \nmaterials \nincluding \ntextbooks \n\nFigure A2: Problem Tree Analysis: Mongolia\u2019s Education System  \n\nSlower Economic Growth \n\nSlower Human Development \n\nWeak Labor Force \n\nLack of General Knowledge and \nQualifications of Graduates \n\nLack of Quality and Relevance of Primary \nand/or Secondary Education \n\n \n\n \n\nSchool \nStructure \n\nEducation \nFinancing \n\nGovernance \nand \nManagement \n\nLearning \nResources and \nInputs \n\nSchool \nFacilities \n\n \n\nPre-Service \nTeacher \nTraining \n\n\u2022  Insufficient school \noperation and \nmaintenance budget \n\u2022  High-cost investments \nin information and \ncommunications \ntechnology (ICT) \nhardware without \nmidterm ICT strategy \nand budget \n\n\u2022  Inconsistencies in \n\nbudget approval and \ndisbursement following \nrecentralization in \n2002 \n\n\u2022  Inadequate capital \n\ninvestments \n\n\u2022  Need to further \nimprove sector \nstrategic \nplanning and \nmanagement \n\u2022  Need to better \n\ntarget \ndisadvantaged \ngroups including \npupils in poor, \nrural areas, and \nboys \n\n\u2022  Need to calculate \n\ntotal cost of \nownership of ICT \nand make \nadequate budget \ninvestments in \nICT \n\n \n\n\u2022  Inadequate \n\nschool facilities \nfor 6-year-olds, \nincluding lack of \nage-appropriate \nwater and \nsanitation \nfacilities  \n\u2022  Insufficient \ndormitory \nspaces and the \nneed to improve \ndormitory \nspaces to \naccommodate \nyounger pupils \n\n\u2022  Poor quality \nlearning \nenvironments \n\n\u2022  Increasing \nparental \ncontributions to \nschooling \n\n\u2022  High cost and low \n\ndurability of \ntextbooks \n\n\u2022  Poorly organized \ndistribution of free \ntextbooks to poor \nstudents \n\n\u2022  Need to develop \n\neducational \nsoftware in \nMongolian \nlanguage \n\n\u2022  Need to enhance \n\ninnovation in \neducation by \nfurther introducing \nICT as a teaching \nand learning tool \n\n \n\n\u2022   Pre-service \n\nteacher training \ncurriculum \nneeds to be \nmodernized \n\u2022  Need for quality \nassurance at \nteacher training \ninstitutes (TTIs)  \n\n\u2022  Need to \nenhance \ncontinuous \nprofessional \ndevelopment for \nteacher \neducators in \nTTIs \n\u2022  Need to \n\nincrease and \nimprove \nteaching \npractice policy \nand \nimplementation \nstrategy \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n2\n \n\n3\n1\n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE MONGOLIAN EDUCATION SECTOR \n\n \n1. \nThe Government of Mongolia has been receiving external assistance for the education \nsector since early 1990s. The Government of Japan is a major bilateral donor, providing grants \nfor renovation and upgrading of primary and secondary schools, strengthening teacher training, \nand  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  education.  The  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) is continuing to support education sector reforms through concessional loans and \ntechnical  assistance.  The  Government  has  signed  the  largest  compact  in  the  history  of  the \nMillennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC),  part  of  which  will  be  devoted  to  developing  the \nvocational training system in Mongolia. Under the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative, in joint \ncollaboration  with  World  Bank  and  ADB,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science \n(MECS) is improving access to basic education and enhancing the quality of its services. The \nWorld  Bank  is  helping  to  establish  classroom  libraries  in  383  soum  and  bagh  schools, \nconducting teacher training through professional development networks and improving national \nmonitoring of quality and efficiency under the Rural Education Support Project financed from an \nInternational  Development  Association  grant.  The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF) \nand  World  Vision  are  active  in  preschool,  primary,  and  secondary  education.  The  European \nCommission  and  Save  the  Children  UK  are  supporting  quality  preschool  and  basic  education \nand  building  the  capacity  of  civil  society  to  advocate  for  access  to  education  for  children  with \ndisabilities.  German  technical  cooperation  provides  assistance  for  demand-oriented  vocational \ntraining,  especially  for  the  building  trade  (in  cooperation  with  ADB  and  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction).  Overall,  external  assistance  to  the  education  sector  development  has \nsignificantly increased in the last few years. Most has been in the form of grants.  \n \nTo  enhance  harmonization  and  coordination  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  external \n2. \nassistance,  the  Government  and  the  donor  community  agreed  to  establish  a  sector-wide \napproach  (SWAp)  in  the  education  sector.  The  Education  Donors\u2019  Consultative  Mechanism \n(EDCM) is now is fully operational and is co-chaired by ADB and the Government of Japan. One \nof  the  key  components  for  implementing  the  SWAp  in  the  education  sector  is  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive  short-term  plan  reflecting  key  objectives  and  strategies  of  education  sector \ndevelopment and enhance the integration of the Government\u2019s education initiatives and those of \nfunding agencies. To implement the Master Plan to Develop Education in Mongolia, the SWAp \nteam has developed a comprehensive 2008 annual implementation plan, in close consultation \nwith EDCM and MECS. This plan highlights partnership arrangements between the Government \nand funding agencies and provides a detailed outline of priority investment areas and targeted \nactivities within the framework of the new master plan.  \n \n3. \nTotal current external funding to the education sector is estimated at $179.6 million, with \n$26.7  million  projected  to  be  spent  in  2008.  Financing  is  provided  by  10  funding  agencies \nthrough 20 outstanding projects. Of the total financing, 57% is expected to come from bilateral \nagencies,  23%  from  international  organizations,  16%  from  the  Education  for  All-Fast  Track \nInitiative, and 4% from international nongovernment organizations. The Government of Japan is \nproviding  62%  of  all  bilateral  assistance  and  MCC  financing  accounts  for  25%.

The procedures to be followed for national competitive \nbidding shall be those set forth in the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia of 1 December 2005, \neffective since 1 February 2006, as amended (Attachment 1 dated 6 February 2007), with the \nclarifications  and  modifications  described  in  the  following  paragraphs  required  for  compliance \nwith the provisions of the Procurement Guidelines. \n \n\n(i) \n\nApplicable procurement procedure. Bidding shall be conducted in accordance \nwith  the  Open  Bidding  Procedure,  as  defined  in  Chapter  Two  of  the  Public \nProcurement Law of Mongolia subject to the provisions stated in paragraph ii (c) \nbelow. \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nParticipation in bidding and preferences \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nGovernment-owned enterprises in Mongolia shall be eligible to participate \nin  bidding  only  if  they  can  establish  that  they  are  legally  and  financially \nautonomous,  operate  under  commercial  law,  and  are  not  a  dependent \nagency  of  the  procuring  entity,  or  the  project  executing  agency  (EA)  or \nimplementing agency (IA). \nProspective  bidders  shall  be  permitted  to  request  bidding  documents \neither  in  person  or  by  mail  upon  submission  of  a  written  application. \nBidding  documents  shall  be  sold  to  anyone  who  is  willing  to  pay  the \nrequired fee for the bidding documents, and no other conditions shall be \nimposed  on  the  sale  of  the  bidding  documents.  The  bidding  documents \nshall be delivered, at the prospective bidders' preference, either by hand \nor by mail or courier, provided that the bidder is willing to pay the mail or \ncourier  delivery  charges,  which  should  be  specified  in  the  bid  invitation. \nEach  bidder  shall  be  allowed  to  purchase  only  one  set  of  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  a  given  tender.  No  limitations  shall  be  imposed  on  any \nbidder  as  to  the  number  of  tenders  in  which  it  may  participate  during  a \ngiven period of time, but the bidder\u2019s qualification (financial and technical \ncapabilities) for award of contract(s) shall be assessed on the basis of its \ncapacity to meet the aggregated qualifying requirements for the award of \ncontracts  for  which  it  has  submitted  the  lowest  evaluated  substantially \nresponsive bids.  \nInterested  foreign  bidders  from  eligible  countries  shall  be  allowed  to \nparticipate without being required to associate or form joint ventures with \nlocal  bidders.  Foreign  bidders  shall  be  eligible  to  participate  in  bidding \nunder the same conditions as local bidders. Mongolian bidders and goods \nmanufactured  in  Mongolia  shall  be  given  no  preference  over  foreign \nbidders  and  goods  manufactured  outside  Mongolia,  either  in  the  bidding \nprocess or in the evaluation of bids. \nPrior registration shall not be a requirement for any bidder to participate in \nbidding. \nPre-qualification of contractors shall not be required, except in the case of \nlarge or complex works and with the prior written concurrence of ADB.  \n\n(iii) \n\nAdvertising.  Invitations  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  the  Mongolian  national \nlanguage  in  at  least  one  widely  circulated  national  daily  newspaper  and  freely \naccessible, nationally-known website in accordance with Article 21.1 of the Public \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n45 \n\nProcurement  Law  of  Mongolia.  Bidding  of  NCB  contracts  estimated  at  (a) \n$500,000 or more for Goods and related services, and (b) $1,000,000 or more for \nWorks shall be advertised concurrently with the general procurement notices on \nADB\u2019s website. \n\n \n(iv) \n\nStandard  bidding  documents.  Standard  bidding  documents,  acceptable  to \nADB,  shall  be  used.  The  bidding  documents  shall  provide  clear  instructions  on \nhow bids should be submitted, how prices should be offered, and the place and \ntime for submission and opening of bids. Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids \nby hand, by mail, or by courier. \n\n \n\n(v) \n\nQualification criteria and evaluation criteria \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\nQualification  criteria  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding  documents, \nand all criteria so specified, shall be used to determine whether a bidder \nis  qualified.  The  evaluation  of  the  bidder\u2019s  qualifications  should  be \nconducted separately from the technical and commercial evaluation of the \nbid.  When  post  qualification  is  applied,  the  assessment  of  bidders' \nqualifications  shall  be  carried  out  only  after  the  preliminary  and  detailed \nevaluation of bids has been completed by the EA/IA and, in doing so, the \nqualifications  of  the  bidder  who  has  submitted  the  lowest  evaluated \nsubstantially  responsive  bid  shall  be  assessed  first.  The  evaluation  of  a \nbidder\u2019s  qualifications  shall  only  take  into  account  the  bidder\u2019s  capacity \nand  resources  to  perform  the  contract,  in  particular  its  experience  and \npast  performance  on  similar  contracts,  capabilities  with  respect  to \npersonnel,  equipment,  and  construction  or  manufacturing  facilities,  and \nfinancial  position.  In  carrying  out  the  post-qualification  assessment,  the \nEA/IA shall exercise reasonable judgment in requesting, in writing, from a \nbidder  only  missing  factual  or  historical  supporting  information  related  to \nthe bidder's qualifications and shall provide a reasonable time period (that \nis, a minimum of 7 days) to the bidder to provide his response.  \nEvaluation  criteria  to  be  used  in  the  evaluation  of  bids  shall  be  clearly \nspecified  in  the  bidding  documents,  and  evaluation  criteria  other  than \nprice  shall  be  quantified  in  monetary  terms.  All  evaluation  criteria  so \nspecified, shall be taken into account in bid evaluation. Merit points shall \nnot be used in bid evaluation.  \n\nBids shall be opened in public, immediately upon the stipulated deadline \nfor  submission  of  bids.  Bidders'  representatives  and  the  Project's \nbeneficiaries  from  the  concerned  local  community  who  choose  to  attend \nshall  be  allowed  to  attend.  The  name  of  the  bidder  and  total  amount  of \neach bid, including discounts, shall be read aloud and recorded in the Bid \nOpening Record.

This  will  support  employment  and  income-generating \nactivities and supporting sustainable human development. In implementing these activities, the Government will ensure \nthat the poor and other vulnerable groups have equal access to basic social services, supporting their opportunities for \nemployment and participation in economic activities. The objective will be for each person to reach satisfactory levels of \neducation, food availability, and health.1  \n \nThe  Project  was  designed  to  closely  reflect  national  priorities  defined  in  the  National  Development  Strategy.  In \nparticular, the Project will: \n \n\n(i)   contribute  to  an  improvement  in  the  quality  of,  and  access  to  education  at  all  levels  by  (a)  reducing  the \nannual  costs  of  education  to  parents,  currently  estimated  to  be  equivalent  to  50%\u201370%  of  the  monthly \nminimum subsistence level set by the National Statistical Office; (b) improving the targeting of free textbook \nsupport  to  the  poorest;  (c)  improving  access  to  information,  skills,  and  training  in  poor  rural  areas  by \ndeveloping  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)-based  education  services  pioneered  by  the \nICT for Innovating Rural Education in Mongolia (IIREM) project; (d) improving the efficiency and use of ICT \nin  primary  and  secondary  schools  through  support  for  the  development  of  a  national  strategy  for  ICT  in \nbasic  education;  (e)  providing  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  rationalize  the  existing  education  planning, \nmanagement,  implementation,  and  monitoring  systems  at  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science \n(MECS) in order to improve the provision of funding to aimags and schools and thus to improve educational \nefficiency  and  quality;  (f)  improving  pre-service  teacher  training  (higher  education)  in  an  effort  to  improve \nquality inputs into the basic education subsector; and (g) improving the teaching and learning environment \nthrough rehabilitation and upgrading of teacher training institute facilities; \n\n(ii)   contribute  to  education  sector  development  by  (a)  providing  technical  assistance,  training,  and  support  in \nplanning,  management,  implementation,  technical,  and  professional  issues,  including  the  coordination, \nsynchronization,  and  upgrading  of  existing  management  information  systems  to  MECS  and  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) staff, including aimag education staff, who will be supported to strengthen their capacity to \nplan, manage, administer, and regulate the system; (b) supporting activities to improve pre-service teacher \ntraining, which will directly and indirectly enhance the quality of professional staff, teacher training courses, \nand assessment of teacher trainees, and will attract a higher quality of applicants and ensure that a higher \nproportion  of  graduates  continue  into  the  teaching  profession;  (c)  addressing  textbook  provision  and  ICT \ninvestment  and  usage,  both  of  which  are  closely  associated  with  quality  and  student  performance. \n(textbooks  represent  the  biggest  single  cost  that  parents  incur  in  sending  their  children  to  school  and  a  \nnational ICT strategy for education will ensure optimum usage and impact of existing and future investments \nin  ICT);  and  (d)  improving  efficiency  through  investments  in  new  and  rehabilitated  facilities  such  as \nclassrooms, dormitories, libraries, learning equipment, textbooks, and instructional materials. \n\n(iii)   contribute to poverty reduction by increasing access to better basic education services, particularly in rural \n\nand peri-urban areas, and by improving opportunities for increased financial earnings.  \n\n \nB.  \n                                                                                                                        non-income Millennium Development Goals \n1.  \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                      Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention-  \n\nKey Issues \n\nThe World Bank Mongolia Poverty Assessment (2006) found that \u201ca composite profile of a poor Mongolian is a person \nwho  lives  in  rural  areas,  has  many  children,  works  with  livestock  and  has  a  lower  secondary  or  lesser  standard  of \neducation.\u201d  There  are  important  differences  in  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  and  poverty  incidence  between \nUlaanbaatar and the rest of the country: Ulaanbaatar has the highest per capita income and lowest poverty rate and \nrural areas have the lowest per capita income and highest poverty rate. Poverty incidence in rural areas is higher than \nin urban areas (43% versus 30% in urban areas in 2002 and 37.9% against 27.9% in 2006). The lowest poverty levels \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nare in Ulaanbaatar (about 27% in 2006), where half of the population lives. The highest levels (51% in 2006) are in the \nWestern  Region.  Until  1998,  poverty  was  more  significant  in  urban  than  in  rural  areas  (in  1998,  39.4%  of  urban \nresidents  and  32.6%  of  rural  residents  were  below  the  poverty  threshold)  but  from  2002  that  situation  has  been \nreversed. From 1998 to 2006 urban poverty levels have declined from 39.4% to 27.9%, but over the same period rural \npoverty  has  worsened  from  32.6%  to  37.9%.  The  differential  poverty  gap  between  urban  and  rural  areas  has \ndeteriorated by 15.4% to the  detriment of rural areas between 1995 and  2006. Between 2002  and 2007 the national \npoverty  thresholds  calculated  by  the  National  Statistical  Office  increased  by  over  300%,  although  the  combined \nconsumer price index and dollar exchange rates decreased the value of the MNT by only 180% over the same period. \nIt is significant that the poverty thresholds have been increased far more in rural areas than in urban areas. Thus, the \npoverty threshold in Ulaanbaatar increased by only 297% between 2002 and 2007 whereas the poverty thresholds in \nCentral, Khangai, and Western Regions have been increased by approximately 370%. This is a clear indication that it \nis  becoming  more  expensive  to  live  in  rural  areas.  In  2007  there  was  an  11%  differential  between  the  poverty \nthresholds  for  Ulaanbaatar  and  the  Eastern  Region.  The  National  Statistical  Office  poverty  threshold  is  based  on  an \nestimate  of  the  income  necessary  to  purchase  a  2,100  kilocalorie  diet,  with  adjustments  for  essential  non-food \nexpenditures.  \n \nThe  World  Bank  analysis  of  the  Living  Standards  Measurement  Survey  of  1998  and  2002  found  that  the  negative \nimpact  of  poverty  on  school  dropout  rates  is  significant  at  every  level  of  schooling\u2014even  at  primary  level  where \ncompletion  rates  are  normally  close  to  universal\u2014and  poverty  has  the  largest  effect  on  upper  secondary  dropouts. \nPoverty affects children\u2019s educational outcomes directly (out-of-pocket and opportunity costs) and indirectly (family or \nparental background). Educational quality (measured by 2006, 2007 basic education examination results conducted by \nthe Education  Evaluation  Center) is significantly lower  in rural  areas. One of the major  causes  of high dropout rates, \nwhich is of specific significance to the poor, is the high parental cost of education. A 100-school survey conducted by \nthe project preparatory technical assistance (TA) indicates that the national average annual cost of sending a child to \nschool varies from MNT83,000 in grade 1 to MNT115,000 in grade 8. However, there are significant regional variations \nand  education  costs  to  parents  are  generally  higher  (up  to  MNT150,000)  and  the  quality  of  education  lower  in  rural \nareas than in Ulaanbaatar. The regional average monthly poverty threshold income was established at MNT54,500 in \n2007 so that the parental costs of education can represent between 1.5 and 2 times the monthly income for a person \non the poverty threshold. Textbooks represent the highest single cost followed by travel to school, school uniforms, and \nstationery.  Textbook  availability  is  rated  as  the  most  important  indicator  of  student  performance  by  parents  and \nteachers and a reduction in the cost of textbooks to parents will have an impact on access to education for the poor.  \nAlmost 30% of schools surveyed indicated that they did not receive the free textbook allocation for poor and vulnerable \nchildren  and  most  schools  indicated  that  in  any  case  it  was  insufficient  to  meet  needs  and  poorly  administered. \nImproving the targeting of the free textbook allocation and the efficiency of the Government\u2019s flagship social assistance \nprogram,  the  Child  Money  Program,  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  affordability  of  education  to  the  poor, \nparticularly  in  rural  areas.  Starting  from  2006,  the  Child  Money  Program  has  provided  MNT3,000  per  month  and \nMNT25,000  per  quarter  to  all  children  aged  0\u201318  regardless  of  household  income.  Early  findings  of  the  ADB-funded \nParticipatory Poverty Assessment and Monitoring Project indicate that the these payments are an important source of \nincome for very poor families, although the informal charges levied by many schools and the overall parental costs of \neducation (see above) are too high for the poor, even with Child Money Program support. Migration from rural to peri-\nurban  areas  has  grown  as  migrants  seek  better  education,  health,  and  other  services,  and  income-generating \nopportunities. This has caused overcrowding in urban schools. High migration rates can also be associated with poor \nstudent performance in soum and bagh schools, and the indirect cost of schooling in relation to household per capita \nexpenditure  increases  significantly  above  grade  8.  As  a  result,  poorer  families  are  under-represented  in  upper \nsecondary education in both rural and urban areas. In effect, poverty is an important factor in determining  whether a \nchild is enrolled in school and also whether a child can progress to senior secondary and higher education. Yet, without \nunhampered access to quality education, opportunities for earning a reasonable income and rising above the poverty \nline are restricted; graduates of at least secondary education are significantly less likely to be poor. \n2.  \n\nDesign Features \n\nWhile the Project aims to improve education sector efficiency as a whole, there will be an emphasis on strengthening \ninstitutional capacity in education sector planning, management, implementation, monitoring, and resource allocation. \nAs far as poor and disadvantaged families and/or areas are concerned, the intended and expected results will ensure \nlower  costs  for  parents,  better  targeting  of  pro-poor  subsidies,  more  inclusiveness,  transparency,  and  efficient \nmonitoring, which will improve access, relevance, quality, and equity in education. The Project will establish rural pilot \nschools  to  continue  the  educational  initiatives  of  ICT  pioneered  in  the  IIREM  project  and  to  pilot  teacher  upgrading \nthrough  distance  education.  These  pilot  schools  will  also  be  benefit  from  the  management  information  system  and \nbudgeting  initiatives  resulting  from  the  finance  system  components.  The  project  design  has  taken  into  account  the \nfollowing factors that hinder basic education enrollment and attainment levels in disadvantaged areas: (i) high levels of \npoverty; (ii) high costs for parents in sending children to school, a particular issue for poor families and families in ger \nsettlements in urban areas; (iii) poor targeting of educational subsidies for the poor; (iv) distant location of the school; \n(v) lack of effective use of ICT investments; and (vi) lack of qualified teachers in some rural areas. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n51\n\nC. \n      \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable. \n\n \nA. \n\nFindings of Social Analysis \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nAs far as targeted beneficiaries are concerned, social problems related to education are largely a rural phenomenon, \nalthough  overcrowding  in  urban  areas  resulting  from  inward  migration  from  rural  areas  is  a  growing  problem  and \ndropout rates and failures to enroll are increasing in ger areas around cities.  First, children tend to be left out of upper \nsecondary  schooling  because  of  a  combination  of  lack  of  access,  poor  educational  quality,  and  limited  household \naffordability.  Despite  general  progress  in  school  attendance  over  the  past  5  years,  rural  students  are  still  at  a \ndisadvantage. In particular, rural students in bagh and soum do not have equal access to upper secondary education \nbecause  rural  schools  closed  senior  secondary  grades  during  the  reorganization  and  rationalization  reform  in  1997, \nwhile  provincial  center  schools  have  only  limited  spaces.  Attrition  rates  are  significantly  higher  among  rural  children, \nand educational quality, measured by exam results, is significantly worse in rural schools. Poverty directly, through out-\nof-pocket  and  opportunity  costs,  and  indirectly,  through  parental  background,  contributes  to  dropout  rates.  Rural \nstudents who tend to perform worse and drop out after the 8th grade are highly likely to be poor. High dropout rates are \na  concern  because  of  their  long-term  implications  for  inter-generational  transmission  of  poverty.  Second,  there  are \nshortcomings  in  implementing  systems  of  teachers'  incentives,  resource  allocation,  and  public  assistance  to  rural \nschools. An assessment of the outcomes from the rationalization and reorganization reform indicated that the reform \neffort seems to have perpetuated the widening gaps in educational outcomes between urban (aimag center and capital \ncity)  and  rural  (soum)  schools.  Third,  the  tendency  to  migrate  from  rural  areas  to  aimag  centers  and  eventually  to \nUlaanbaatar  has  been  very  strong.  According  to  findings  of  the  survey  Children  on  the  Move:  Rural-urban  Migration \nand  Access  to  Education  in  Mongolia,  the  major  reasons  for  households  to  move  were  to  find  jobs  (34.3%),  to  give \nchildren better education (31.2% overall but the most important reason among women), and to get closer to services \nand  information  (20.6%).  During  the  last  10  years,  30%  of  migrants  coming  to  Ulaanbaatar  have  been  school-age \nchildren. As a result of this additional burden, some urban schools have to organize classes in three shifts with up to 60 \npupils per class. School-age migrant children are more than three times more likely to be out of school than children of \nlong-term  residents.  A  third  of  migrant  children  have  dropped  out  of  their  schools  mainly  because  of  registration \nproblems,  discrimination  at  school,  and  family  poverty.  This  situation  not  only  contradicts  the  expectations  of  many \nmigrants,  who  came  to  the  city  to  get  their  children  a  better  education,  but  also  negatively  affects  the  quality  of \neducation  in  areas  of  both  origin  and  destination.  If  the  trend  continues,  it  will  create  serious  burdens  on  the  capital \ncity\u2019s  schooling,  housing,  infrastructure,  environment,  and  social  services.  If  the  impacts  of  migration  are  not \nconsidered more systematically, national goals for access to education will probably not be achieved. \n \nMore access to high-quality  and relevant basic education for rural students is a priority for equitable  and sustainable \ndevelopment in Mongolia. Therefore the Project will assist the Government (both directly and indirectly) in addressing \noptions  to  improve  access  for  rural  children,  including  (i)  reducing  costs  for  parents,  (ii)  improving  targeting  of \neducational subsidies, (iii) increasing the efficiency of planning and budgeting, (iv) improving the availability and usage \nof key quality inputs into the education system, (v) focusing on improved quality in rural schools, and (vi) improving the \nefficiency and quality of pre-service teacher education.  \n \nB. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\nThe  assessment  and  consultation  were  done  jointly  with  the  Government  to  ensure  participation  by  all  relevant \nstakeholders. All the executing agencies (EAs) and other stakeholders were consulted. The Project was designed in a \nparticipatory  process  involving  major  government  and  nongovernment  stakeholders  at  national  and  provincial  levels, \nschool  directors  and  teachers,  community  leaders,  and  development  partners  through  regular  consultations, \nworkshops, and presentations. During the project preparatory TA, interviews were conducted with all of the above, plus \nall development partners and foreign and local NGOs actively involved in the education sector. Field visits were made \nto  schools  and  education  departments  in  seven  aimags  in  addition  to  school  visits  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  of \nUlaanbaatar. Focus group discussions with teachers and parents were organized in five aimags and a comprehensive \nschool  survey  was  administered  in  100  schools  in  five  aimags  (over  13%  of  the  total  number  of  Mongolia  schools) \nbased on a preliminary test survey organized in 20 schools in two other aimags. A total of 18 schools were visited by \nproject  preparatory  TA  consultants  and  were  studied  in  detail  through  visits  to  dormitories,  classrooms,  libraries, \ncomputer  labs,  kitchens,  washing  and  toilet  facilities,  and  sports  halls.  Written  submissions  were  invited  from  higher \neducation and teacher training institutes and a survey of selected higher education institutions was also undertaken.  \n \nDuring implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in all of its activities. It will encourage \n(i)  nationwide  consultation  in  the  rationalization  of  the  planning,  management,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nresource allocation in the education sector; (ii) partnership between education and training institutions and industry in \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ndeveloping and delivering market-oriented training curricula and programs; (iii) greater parental involvement in school \nmanagement; (iv) active consultation and participation of parents in the design of low-cost textbook rental schemes and \nrevolving  funds;  and  (v)  greater  school  and  parental  involvement  in  administration  and  decision-making  on  subsidy \nschemes for the poor. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing         \n\n  Consultation        \n\n  Collaborative decision making    \n\n  Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.      Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nThis Project was designed jointly with the Government and other stakeholders and all of the executing agencies were \nconsulted.  They  agreed  to  ensure  participation  by  relevant  stakeholders  by  following  a  participatory  approach  during \nproject  implementation,  especially  in  the  implementation,  operation  and  maintenance  of  improved  facilities,  and  civil \nworks.  The  project  steering  committee  set  up  under  the  Second  and  Third  Education  Development  Projects  will  be \nused to provide policy guidance for this Project to coordinate consultation and participation, and to ensure consistency, \nharmonization, and continuity of activities in the context of the sector-wide approach.  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. According to the ADB/World Bank Mongolia country gender assessment (2005), more girls than boys \nare enrolled in school in every aimag, including Ulaanbaatar city. This pattern emerged in the immediate post-transition \nperiod, although the gap has narrowed in recent years. Dropout rates for boys at secondary level are high among poor \nfamilies  in  urban  areas,  while  in  rural  areas,  children  drop  out  even  at  primary  level.

(ii) develop strategies to \naddress  gender  stereotyping  in  curriculum  and  textbook  development;  (iii)  reduce  gender \ndisparities by making textbooks cheaper and encouraging good teachers to teach in rural areas; \nand  (iv)  assist  in  reducing  the  dropout  rates  of  boys  in  rural  areas  by  targeting  dormitory \nsubsidies at poor rural households.  \n \n\nTable A9: Gender Action Plan \n\nProject Component \nOutput 1: Strengthening planning, \nbudgeting, and management of \neducation \n\u2022  Strengthening information \n\n\u2022 \n\nsystems \nImproving planning and school-\nbased financial strategies  \n\u2022  Ensuring adequate school-\n\nbased operational budgets that \nare sufficient to ensure the \neffective delivery of curriculum \nobjectives and outcomes  \n\n \n\nTasks \n\n\u2022  Ensure use of gender-disaggregated data and \nmake sure gender issues are addressed in \nprimary and secondary education through \nsynchronized education management information \nsystems \nInclude gender, poverty, and indigenous \nconsiderations in funding criteria  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Ensure that male and female staff of Ministry of \n\nEducation, Culture, and Science (MECS), district \neducation administrations, and schools have equal \nopportunities to participate in capacity building \ntraining \n\n\u2022  Develop MECS staff capacity to identify barriers to \n\nboys\u2019 participation in education \n\n\u2022  Create conditions in schools to encourage the \n\nemployment of more men in teaching positions  \n\u2022  Prepare inclusive social development plans that \nincorporate an analysis of gender issues and \nplans to address them \n\n\u2022  Study potential policies for targeting dormitory \nsubsidies and cash transfers at poor rural \nhouseholds, and, in particular, for boys  \n\n\u2022  Ensure baseline surveys consider gender specific \n\nquestions \n\n \n\u2022 \n\nOutput  2:  Enhancing  quality  and \nrelevance  of  pre-service  teacher \ntraining \n\u2022  Reforming the curricula of \n\nteacher training institutes (TTIs) \n\n\u2022  Developing implementing a \ncomprehensive quality \nassurance system in TTIs \nImproving continuous \nprofessional development for \nteacher educators \n\n\u2022 \n\nInclude components in the pre-service teacher \ntraining curricula, to help teachers identify and \novercome barriers to boys\u2019 participation in school \n\n\u2022  Develop all teacher training curricula, materials, \n\nand courses from a gender perspective \n\n\u2022  Ensure that selection criteria for TTIs include a \n\nfocus on gender equity and the encouragement of \nmen as student teachers in TTIs \n\n\u2022  Deliver gender-sensitive teaching to all student \n\nteachers in TTIs \n\n\u2022  Ensure training in gender-sensitive teaching is \n\n \n\n\fProject Component \n\u2022  Reforming teaching practice \npolicy and implementation \nstrategy \nImproving teaching and \nlearning resources provision \n\n\u2022 \n\nOutput  3:  Better  affordability, \nquality,  availability,  and  effective \nusage  of  teaching  and  learning \nmaterials \n\u2022  Creating a textbook rental \n\n\u2022 \n\nscheme and revolving fund for \nprimary schools \nImproving content, teaching, \nand information access to poor \nschools in rural areas \n\n\u2022  Developing a midterm national \n\nICT strategy \n\n \nOutput 4: Upgrading facilities in \nTTIs  \n\nProgram Management \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n55\n\nTasks \n\nprovided to all teacher educators \n\n\u2022  Promote men\u2019s participation in the teaching \n\nworkforce \n\n\u2022  Ensure provision of scholarships for teacher \n\ntraining for rural teachers \n\n \n\u2022  Develop gender-neutral textbooks and \n\nsupplementary materials (i.e., avoid  gender \nstereotyping)  \n\n\u2022  Develop gender-appropriate information and \n\ncommunication technology (ICT) applications, \nsoftware, and learning objects \n\n\u2022  Ensure that free textbooks for poor and vulnerable \n\nfamilies reach boys, girls, and members of ethnic \nminorities \n\n\u2022  Translate textbooks into the Kazakh language  \n\n\u2022  Ensure that the selection of schools for the ICT \n\nsubcomponent includes schools in aimags with a \nhigh concentration of ethnic minorities, e.g., \nBayan-Olgiy \nIn evaluating bidding proposals for rehabilitation of \nschools and school facilities, ensure preference is \ngiven to construction companies owned or \noperated by ethnic minorities \n\n \n\u2022  Create gender sensitivity among all stakeholders \n\u2022  Ensure gender disaggregated data, analysis and \nreporting on all project activities and components  \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLessons \n1.

The  objective  of  the \nSWAp TA is to support a gradual shift to pooled funding \nand budget support in the education sector. The Project \nwill  support  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and \nScience  to  enhance  funding  agency  coordination  by \nstrengthening  technical  and  management  capacity  to \ntake  a  phased  approach  to  establishing  an  advanced \nalignment mechanism in education.  \nUnder component 1, the Project will support streamlining \nof budgetary and financial guidelines to ensure adequate \noperation and maintenance budgets for facilities.

Textbooks  are  currently  produced  using  expensive  four-color  printing  but \n1. \ninadequate binding. The use of four-color printing for textbooks that are expected to last for only \n1 year is wastage of scarce resources and an additional cost to parents. Consideration should \nbe given to using four-color printing on one side of the printed sheet but one-color printing on \nthe reverse side, which would probably reduce printing costs by around 20\u201325%. However, this \nrequires editorial and design skill to make sure that all the color work is correctly positioned. \n \n2. \nDistribution  and  Durability.  Publishers  confirm  that  textbooks  that  are  not  bought  by \nparents represent a considerable waste, which has to be built into textbook costs. Pre-ordering \nsystems  would  reduce  wastage  but  maintain  competition  and  school-based  choice.  It  would \nreduce  textbook  costs,  although  the  biggest  textbook  cost  reduction  possibilities  would  come \nfrom extending book life.   \n  \nB. \n \n3. \nA  considerable  body  of  international  evidence  demonstrates  that  durable  textbooks \nenable the longest reasonable textbook life consistent with the need to provide regular revision, \nreview, and updating. A target book life of 4 to 5 years was regularly achieved during the central \nplanning  period  and  is  also  a  reasonable  period  for  review  and  updating  of  both  curriculum \nrequirements and textbook content. A long book life combined with an efficient textbook rental \nsystem is the most cost-effective system. \n \n4. \nIf parental contributions are to remain the main  source of textbook financing, there are \ntwo basic approaches. These are (i) parental purchase of textbooks, and (ii) parental payment \nof  rental  fees  for  books,  which  are  loaned  to  the  student  from  the  school  textbook  library. \nParental  purchase,  which  implies  ownership  of  textbooks,  has  three  fundamental  problems:  \n(i)  it  is  not  equitable,  since  rich  parents  can  buy  more  new  textbooks  than  poor  parents;  (ii) \nschools  find  it  difficult  to  manage  the  optimum  usage  of  incomplete  textbook  supplies,  since \nparents who have purchased textbooks may object to a textbook being borrowed or used by a \nstudent who has not; and (iii) it is usually more difficult for parents to afford than rental systems.  \n \n5. \nIn a rental system, textbooks are owned by the school, so poor and rich students benefit \nequally.  School  ownership  also  allows  the  equitable  distribution  of  available  books  if  there  is \nless than 100% provision. Under a rental system, parents who can afford to may also buy their \nown  copies  of  textbooks  for  use  at  home.  Perhaps  the  most  important  advantage  of  a  rental \nsystem over a purchase system is that the full costs of provision do not necessarily have to be \npaid in advance by the parent. They can be spread over a 4- or 5-year period and can even be \npaid on a quarterly basis. This significantly reduces the periodic investments that parents make \nin textbooks and makes it possible even for poor parents to support the scheme. Focus group \ndiscussions with teachers made it very clear that a most parents find it very hard too afford to \nbuy  all  the  textbooks  at  one  time  at  the  beginning  of  the  school  year.  They  would  strongly \nwelcome a system that reduced the size of their financial outlay, and allowed costs to be spread \nover several quarters rather than paid all at once every September.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n59\n\nSetting-up a Textbook Rental Scheme and Revolving Fund \n\n \nC. \n \n6. \nA textbook rental scheme is a method of providing textbook sets on loan to students in \nreturn  for  an  annual  rental  fee.  Rental  fees  paid  by  parents  are  held  and  accumulated  in  a \ntextbook  revolving  fund  which  is  used  to  purchase  replacement  copies  when  textbooks  reach \nthe  end  of  their  targeted  useful  classroom  life.  The  fund  \u201crevolves\u201d  because  expenditures  on \nreplacement copies are replaced by continued rental fee contributions from parents. The rental \nfee  income  has  to  be  calculated  and  managed  to  ensure  that  there  is  sufficient  funding  to \nguarantee full replacement supplies. Textbook rental schemes and revolving funds work best if \nworking  capital  can  be  made  available  to  supply  all  textbook  requirements  free  of  charge  to \nschools on a staggered basis over a period of 4-5 years. In this scenario the Government and/or \nfunding agencies would fund the initial supplies to schools. The accumulated rental fees would \nfund  replacement  costs  and  would  provide  the  basis  of  a  sustainable,  parent-funded  system. \nThis is the textbook revolving fund. \n \nTextbook  rental  fees  are  normally  held  in  dedicated  interest-bearing  school  bank \n7. \naccounts  controlled  by  elected  management  committees  of  parents  and  staff.  This  means \nparents  can  see  that  the  funds  are  used  entirely  for  the  benefit  of  the  children  in  their  own \ncommunity. Bank statements should be posted on school notice boards to demonstrate that the \nfunds have not been diverted. If the national textbook provision system operates on the basis of \na 4-year book life, funds should ideally be accumulated without expenditure over 4 years. At the \nend of this period, the funds can be used to purchase replacement copies for textbooks that are \nworn out, or need to be replaced by new approved editions.  \n \n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  current  policy  of  free  textbook  allocations  to  20%  of  the  students  is \ninsufficient  given  the  national  poverty  level  of  32%,  is  not  well  targeted,  and  is  reported  to  be \nadministered  inefficiently.  If  the  Government  wishes  to  continue  to  provide  support  to  the \npoorest through a rental system it can remit cash payments directly into these school textbook \nbank  accounts,  enabling  schools  to  offer  the  poorest  students  free  books  of  lower  rental \ncharges.  Transferring  cash  directly  into  school  textbook  bank  accounts  is  more  efficient  and \ncheaper than physically transferring books. It also prevents the diversion of free textbooks away \nfrom schools at the aimag level and ensures that the free textbooks are those selected by the \nschools,  which  is  not  the  case  at  the  moment.  In  order  to  ensure  the  proper  and  efficient \nmanagement  of  the  system,  it  is  normal  to  establish  a  national  trust  or  nongovernment \norganization  (NGO)  to  manage  the  system  (this  is  what  is  done  in  Armenia  and  Uzbekistan). \nEvery  school  textbook  fund  would  be  a  voting  member  of  the  trust  or  NGO  and  would  be \nrequired  to  operate  according  to  the  rules  and  regulations  it  establishes.  Legal  charters  and \noperational  rules  and  regulations  that  exist  in  other  countries  can  be  adapted  for  use  in \nMongolia. Every school in the aimag would vote to appoint an aimag representative on the trust \nor  NGO  board,  which  would  comprise  senior  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Education, \nCulture,  and  Science  (MECS),  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and  the  aimag  representatives. \nThere would also be a small group of permanent trust or NGO management staff funded from \nan agreed percentage of the interest earned on accumulated rental fees in each school account. \nThis would be automatically transferred to the trust or NGO every year. \n \n9. \nThe  charter,  rules,  and  regulations  would  prevent  any  transfer  of  funds  away  from \nschools (with the exception of the transfers noted above). They would prevent the use of funds \nfor any purpose other than the procurement of textbooks. All decision-making would be made by \nthe school textbook fund committees. The charter would guarantee that the collected rental fees \nbelong to the schools and not to the MECS or MOF. Each school bank account would normally \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n \n\nAppendix 11 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nbe  established  on  a  \u201cdeposit  only\u201d  basis  for  the  initial  4  years  to  guarantee  that  funds \naccumulate. All school bank account details would automatically be copied to the trust or NGO \n(for  information  only,  not  for  withdrawals)  and  simple  software  programs  would  enable  school \naccounts  to  be  monitored  so  problem  schools  (e.g.,  those  with  unacceptably  low  rental  fee \ncollection rates) would be identified early and helped by the local aimag inspectorate.  \n \n10. \nTextbook  rental  fees  should  be  calculated  annually  by  the  trust  or  NGO  and \ncommunicated to schools and parents. Simple and cheap aimag-based computerized ordering \nsystems  would  enable  schools  to  place  their  order  requirements  early  each  year  using \nelectronic  order  forms  and  price  lists  prepared  by  the  trust  or  NGO  operating  on  behalf  of \nMECS.  The  orders  would  be  stored  electronically  at  the  aimag  level  and  consolidated  by  the \ntrust  or  NGO.  This  means  publishers  can  be  provided  with  accurate  print  runs  and  lists  of \nschools  to  which  they  should  deliver  books  direct.  This  avoids  waste  and  publishers\u2019  risk  and \nwill  ultimately  reduce  costs.  It  also  means  that  schools  have  books  delivered  direct  and  that \nparents are spared the cost of traveling to aimag centers to buy books.  \n \nThe  system  of  textbook  loans  from  school  textbook  stores  to  students  operated \n11. \nsuccessfully in Mongolia for many years. The concept is therefore very familiar. What is needed \nto  move  to  a  rental  fee  and  revolving  fund  system  is  the  addition  of  rental  fee  collections,  the \nopening  and  management  of  textbook  fund  bank  accounts,  and  the  establishment  of  the \nmanaging  trust  or  NGO.  The  development  of  a  rental  fee  and  revolving  fund  system  is  not \nunduly  complex,  although  considerable  careful  preparation  is  required.  Assurances  will  be \nrequired  from  the  Government  to  establish  the  trust  or  NGO  as  the  management  authority  for \nthe  pilot  textbook  rental  scheme  and  textbook  revolving  fund.  All  Mongolian  schools  already \noperate their own bank accounts, so there will be no problem in opening an additional dedicated \ntextbook rental scheme and revolving funds account. Existing NGO legislation in Mongolia can \nbe used to establish a textbook rental scheme and revolving funds trust and new legislation is in \npreparation that is aimed solely at enabling the operation of charitable trusts. \n \nD. \n \n12.  MECS  policy  supports  the  development  of  competing  textbooks.  An  effective  textbook \nrental  scheme  will  provide  a  predictable  textbook  market,  which  will  support  the  rapid \ndevelopment of private sector publishing and printing. Armenia, for example, with a population \nalmost  identical  to  that of  Mongolia,  has  competing  alternative  textbooks  for  each  subject  and \ngrade level. The MECS would be responsible for selecting a list of textbooks from competitive \nsubmissions  by  publishers  against  defined  content  and  methodological  requirements. \nEvaluation  and  selection  will  be  transparent  and  according  to  established  criteria.  Individual \nschools may then choose whichever title they wish from the list of approved textbooks. Genuine \nand  significant  improvement  in  textbook  content,  design,  and  teaching  approach  will  only \ndevelop when there is creative competition between publishers.
