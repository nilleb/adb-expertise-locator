I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China (PRC)  for the  Yunnan  Pu\u2019er  Regional  Integrated  Road \nNetwork Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will alleviate poverty and promote regional integration through improved rural \naccessibility.  It  will  enhance  trade  between  Yunnan  Pu\u2019er  and  neighboring  countries  by \n(i) upgrading regional roads serving national borders; (ii) improving roads, road maintenance, \nand public transport services in rural areas; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity.2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Yunnan Province, located in southwest PRC, is one of the country\u2019s least developed \nprovinces. Due to road network limitations the rural population suffers from lack of access to \nmarkets and economic opportunities. High transport costs limit the extent of regional trade and \nconstrain residents\u2019 income-earning potential. With better road connections, Yunnan could serve \nas a gateway for transport and trade with neighboring countries.  \n \n4.  Pu\u2019er is a mountainous prefecture in southern Yunnan with a land area of 45,385 square \nkilometers (12% of Yunnan\u2019s total). Bordering Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam, it had a gross domestic product per capita of CNY11,795 in 2011, \n62% of the Yunnan average and about half the national average. Rural gross domestic product \nper capita was one-third of the prefecture average (CNY4,338). Of 2.56 million inhabitants (5% \nof Yunnan\u2019s total), 950,000 were below the government\u2019s official poverty line,3 representing a \n37.1% poverty rate, with all nine counties designated as national poverty counties.4 \n \n5.  Road transport is the dominant transport mode in Pu\u2019er. It is an important enabling factor \nin economic development and poverty reduction. In 2011, total transport in Pu\u2019er amounted to \n3.8 billion ton kilometers and 2.8 billion passenger kilometers,5 mostly carried by road.6 Pu\u2019er \nhas 615,900 registered vehicles,7 and 73 transport service enterprises employing over 11,000 \npeople. \n \n6.  The road network in Pu\u2019er has a total length of 19,424 kilometer (km), comprising 2,504 \nkm of national and provincial roads and 16,291 km of county, township, village, and special \nroads. The proportion of unclassified roads in Pu\u2019er (34%) is relatively high compared with the \nYunnan average (23%), and although the proportion of unpaved roads is similar to the rest of \n                                                                                       \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Yunnan Pu\u2019er \nRegional Integrated Road Network Development Project (TA 8149).  \n3  Defined as an annual income of below CNY2,300. \n4  A national poverty county designation represents an average rural per capita net income of less than CNY2,300. \n5  Government of the People's Republic of China, Statistical Bureau of Yunnan Province. 2012. Yunnan Statistical \nYearbook. Kunming. \n6  Water transport in Pu\u2019er for 2011 involved 600,000 passengers (6% of Yunnan\u2019s total) and 160,000 tons (3% of \nYunnan\u2019s total). In 2009, water transport serviced less than 1% of total passenger-kilometers and freight ton-\nkilometers. There are no railways in Pu\u2019er.

Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Statistical Bureau of Yunnan Province.  2012. Yunnan \nStatistical Yearbook. Kunming. ", "2 \nthe province, a larger percentage of these are earthen roads (about 34% of the network in Pu\u2019er \ncompared with 20% for Yunnan Province). \n \n7.  The Yunnan Highway Administration Bureau is responsible for administering most of the \nnational  and  provincial  roads  in  Pu\u2019er  prefecture.8 The  Pu\u2019er  Municipal  Transport  Bureau \n(PMTB) administers just under a third of provincial roads, along with all county, township, \nvillage, and special roads, accounting for about 90% of the classified road network. The PMTB \nmanages  road  construction  and  large-scale  maintenance  works,  in  part  through  the  Pu\u2019er \nHighway Maintenance and Management Company.9 County transport bureaus, supported by \nstaff in townships and villages, maintain roads below the provincial level. \n \n8.  Poor  transport  access  is  strongly  associated  with  higher  poverty  levels  in  Pu\u2019er. \nAgricultural trade volumes are limited because many agricultural products are perishable.10 This \ncontributes to the vulnerability of farmers during periods when roads are impassable. Limited \naccess has also led to the prevalence of monopoly transport intermediaries that suppress farm-\ngate prices. Poor transport provision limits interaction with more advanced areas, and reduces \nthe effectiveness of government-led agricultural and rural development programs. Villagers in \nmountain areas are less aware of the employment and service opportunities available in urban \nareas, making them less likely to migrate and contribute to rural incomes through remittances.  \n \n9.  Cross-border trade and transport. Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, is the \nnorthern  anchor  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  that \nconnects the PRC to Thailand via routes through both the Lao PDR and Myanmar. It is a hub for \ntrade between the PRC and countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and also \nIndia and Bangladesh. Yunnan\u2019s external trade is growing rapidly. The total value of imports and \nexports has risen from under $2 billion in 2001 to $12.3 billion in 2011, representing an average \nincrease of 20% per annum over 10 years. In 2011, the values of imports and exports were \nroughly equal (a little over $6 billion each), but imports are growing substantially faster than \nexports. \n \n10.  Despite being the only prefecture in Yunnan bordering Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet \nNam, international trade generated in Pu\u2019er was $100 million in 2011 (less than 1% of the \nYunnan total). This reflects a lack of high-quality border crossings and road connections. Of the \nprefecture\u2019s 20 existing border crossings, only three are class I crossings (one with Myanmar \nand two with the Lao PDR).11 A fourth class I crossing is needed to serve the border with Viet \nNam  at  Longfu  in  Jiangcheng  county.  This  requires  investment  in  upgrading  the  Ning\u2019er\u2013\nJiangcheng\u2013Longfu road to connect the border and the provincial expressway network. This \nimprovement, along with the newly constructed Menkang crossing to the Lao PDR, will place \nJiangcheng  county  at  the  center  of  Yunnan\u2019s  trade  with  neighboring  countries,  since  it  is \nequidistant from the nearest trading centers in Yunnan (Pu\u2019er), Lao PDR (Phongsali), and Viet \nNam (Dien Bien Phu). \n \n11.  In 2005, the Pu\u2019er Municipal Government (PMG) commissioned development of a border \neconomic cooperation zone at Meng\u2019a to serve trade with Myanmar\u2019s Shan State. Between \n                                                                                       \n8  Responsibility is assigned to the Simao General Section, supported by a maintenance center (heavy equipment), \ncounty-level  maintenance  sections  (management  staff),  maintenance  stations  (maintenance  workers),  and \nequipment stations (equipment and workers). \n9  This company is owned by the Pu\u2019er Municipal Government, but placed under the authority of the PMTB. \n10 Fruit, tobacco, tea, sugar cane, and meat. \n11 Of the 20 border crossings, 17 are with Myanmar, 2 with the Lao PDR, and 1 with Viet Nam. \n ", "3 \n2007 and 2012, total trade through Meng\u2019a increased from $59 million to $271 million,12 at an \naverage annual growth rate of 35%.13 However, trade facilities and road connections to Meng\u2019a \nare inadequate to service demand and are constraining growth in trade volumes. To meet \ndemand it is necessary to expand transit and storage facilities at Meng\u2019a and improve road \nconnections from Meng\u2019a to the provincial highway network at Lancang via Menglian. \n \n12.  Rural access. About 94% of the province\u2019s land area is covered by mountains and hills, \nwhich pose a great obstacle to the provision of basic access to rural roads. At present, Pu\u2019er\u2019s \nrural roads provide communities with access to (i) markets for sale and purchase of produce \nand agricultural inputs; (ii) collection or processing stations for the sale of cash crops; (iii) towns \nand  cities for  seasonal  employment  opportunities;  and  (iv) social  services.  Although  some \nlimited services and facilities exist in or around the administrative villages (clinic, processing \nstations, and primary schools), most are located in the townships (markets, hospitals, primary \nand middle schools, banks, police, coffee collection stations, and tea processing plants). Some \nservices and facilities are only available in the county towns (major markets, large hospitals, and \nsecondary schools). Demand for rural transport is substantial\u2014between the villages and the \nnearest townships up to five times a month for each household, to the county town once or \ntwice a month, and to the prefecture capital a few times a year. \n \n13.  Better  approaches  to  road  maintenance  planning  and  management  are  required  to \nprotect Yunnan\u2019s growing stock of rural road assets. Annual funding levels for the different road \ntypes vary according to the county, from CNY1,200 per km for village roads to CNY11,200 per \nkm  for  county  roads.  Nearly  half  this  funding  is  used  for  financing  maintenance  stations \n(construction and maintenance of buildings, and equipment purchases), and about 32% is spent \non servicing pension liabilities, leaving only 25% for actual maintenance work. \n \n14.  The lack of a consistently applied road maintenance system results in underutilization of \nfunding  allocations.  In  some  areas  along  the  township  and  village  road  network,  no \nmaintenance is organized. Local villages then assume responsibility, with households voluntarily \ncontributing a few work days a year. In practice, the burden is carried disproportionately by \nwomen and the poor. The system has failed to improve road conditions. The voluntary nature \nresults in low productivity, less than optimal timing, and a lack of investment in technical skills, \nall of which compromise maintenance quality. A community-based maintenance system needs \nto be introduced, with (i) remuneration to ensure timely performance; (ii) training in management \nand maintenance practices; and (iii) provision of tools, safety equipment, and construction \nmaterials. A practical, cost-effective system could generate jobs and serve to reduce poverty. \n \n15.  Road safety. Yunnan\u2019s road crash fatality rate per 100,000 persons is 4.1 (3.9 in Pu\u2019er), \ncomparable to the rates in France and the United Kingdom. However, the fatality rate per \n10,000 vehicles or per billion vehicle-kilometers is 3\u20135 times higher, implying that low overall \nfatality  rates  are  due  to  the  low  number  of  vehicles,  not  to  high  road  safety.  As  rapid \nmotorization continues, fatality rates are likely to rise unless more attention is given to road \nsafety. A road safety emphasis needs to be an integral part of the engineering design process. \n \n16.  On lower-class rural roads, fatality rates are much lower due to low driving speeds, and \ncollisions are not common. Many of the fatalities that do occur involve vehicles rolling over \nsharp declines (47%). Crashes resulting in multiple casualties are largely due to people using \n                                                                                       \n12 Includes the value of international trade from all origins in PRC external to Pu\u2019er prefecture. \n13 The main imports are ore sands, rubber, timber, sugar cane, and fruit. The main exports are construction \nequipment, building materials, commodities, fuel oil, vehicles, and electrical products. \n ", "4 \ninappropriate  and  overloaded  vehicles.  This  is  partly  because  rural  village-based  public \ntransport  services  either  do  not  exist  or  are  inadequate.  School  children  are  routinely \ntransported to and from school on motorcycles or tractor-trailers, which offer little protection in a \ncrash. There is a need to establish sustainable models of safe rural public transport services.  \n \n17.  Lessons. ADB has supported six road projects in Yunnan since 1994.14 Several lessons \nhave informed the present project design, most notably the need to (i) carefully plan and monitor \nland acquisition and resettlement, (ii) establish a focused project performance and monitoring \nsystem, (iii) consult widely with key stakeholders during the design stage, and (iv) incorporate \npost-project maintenance planning.  \n \n18.  Strategic relevance. Connecting rural villages to regional transport and trade systems \nis in line with the government\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan,15 which attaches importance to regionally \nbalanced growth. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s assistance to the PRC under the 2011\u20132015 \ncountry partnership strategy16 in the areas of (i) inclusive growth and balanced development and \n(ii) regional cooperation and integration. The project provides a replicable model that fits well \nwith  ADB's  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative, 17  which  identifies  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration, road safety, and social sustainability as priorities for ADB operations. This project \nwill alleviate access constraints and ensure that benefits from the expanding regional road \nnetwork extend to rural areas. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The impact of the project  will be enhanced regional integration and trade  between \nYunnan  Pu\u2019er  and  neighboring  countries.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  improved \naccessibility between rural and border areas, and an improved regional transport network in \nYunnan Pu\u2019er.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n20.  The project will include three outputs for ADB financing: (i) regional roads development, \n(ii) rural access improvement, and (iii) institutional development. \n \n21.  Output 1: Regional roads development. This involves (i) upgrades to or construction \nof 234 km of class III, IV, and III highway between Ning\u2019er\u2013Jiangcheng\u2013Longfu;18 (ii) upgrades \nto or construction of the 48.75 km Menglian\u2013Meng\u2019a section of the Lancang\u2013Menglian\u2013Meng\u2019a \nclass III and IV border road, mainly to class II standard; (iii) introduction of road safety measures \n                                                                                       \n14 ADB. 2013.

Output  2:  Rural  access  improvement.  This  will  provide  all-weather  access  to \nadministrative villages and links with higher-level roads. It comprises (i) upgrading to class IV \nstandard of 600 km of village earthen or gravel roads selected in accordance with the rural road \nassessment criteria,20 (ii) spot improvements on up to 1,200 km of connecting lower-level village \nroads, (iii) introduction of five new village bus service routes on a pilot basis, and (iv) a gender-\nfocused rural road maintenance program.21  \n \n23.  Output 3: Institutional development. This will strengthen the implementation capacity \nof  the  PMG.  A  project  management  consultant  will  assist  the  PMG  in  implementing  and \nmonitoring the project in accordance with ADB procedures. The project will finance a 3-year \nprogram  of  international  and  domestic  training  in  financial  and  project  management,  road \nmaintenance  engineering,  road  maintenance  practices,  road  safety,  environmental \nmanagement, social safeguard management, and enforcement of laws that ban the trafficking of \nhumans, drugs, and wildlife. \n \nD.

The financing of taxes and duties related to \nconsulting services is acceptable as (i) the amount is within the reasonable threshold identified during preparation \nof the country partnership strategy, (ii) the amount does not represent an excessive share of the project investment \nplan, (iii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iv) the financing of taxes and duties is \nmaterial and relevant to the success of the project.   \nb  In mid-2014 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies are 5% of base cost. Price contingencies were computed on foreign exchange costs at \n1.0% in 2015, 1.4% in 2016, 1.4% in 2017, and 1.4% in 2018. Price contingencies were computed on local \ncurrency costs at 3.0% in 2015, 3.0% in 2016, 3.0% in 2017, and 3.0% in 2018. \n                                                                                       \n19 The ChinaRAP design methodology uses road attribute risk factors, often called crash modification factors, to \nrelate road attributes to crash rates. These factors assess the likelihood that a crash will occur, and the severity of \nthose that do occur, for both existing roads and for road designs. The methodology involves an economic analysis \nof road safety countermeasures, with benefits expressed in the value of deaths and injuries prevented.  \n20 Rural road assessment criteria shall include the following: (i) the road connects multiple village groups and \nadministrative villages; (ii) the road connects to a national or provincial highway or an important county road; \n(iii) the road will not have a dead end or stop between village groups; (iv) the road will not involve new construction \nor major impacts on environment and resettlement (safeguards category B or C); and (v) there will be a balance in \ninvestment among the nine counties. \n21 The project uses the implementation manual developed for the community-based routine maintenance of roads by \nwomen\u2019s groups in Dehong Yunnan Province that was financed by ADB\u2019s Gender and Development Cooperation \nFund  in  2010.  The  Dehong  pilot  provided  a  boost  to  household  incomes  and  demonstrated  that  routine \nmaintenance can be performed effectively by women\u2019s groups.  \n ", "6 \nd  Interest during construction on ADB loan computed at 2.164%, being the sum of the 5-year US dollar swap rate on \n3 December 2013 plus 0.5% spread and a maturity premium of 0.2%.

The PRC requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, 98.8% \nof which will finance civil works with the remaining 1.2% financing consulting services. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, a maturity premium of 0.2%, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government requested that \nrepayment follows the annuity 10% repayment option and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government will finance contingencies to \ncover any finance shortfall that may arise during implementation. \n \n26.  The borrower is the PRC. The PMG will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate \nrisks for the ADB loan. The borrower has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and \n(ii) assurances that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n27.  The borrower will relend the loan proceeds to the Yunnan Provincial Government (YPG) \non terms and conditions acceptable to ADB, and the YPG will make the proceeds of the loan \navailable  to  the  PMG.  Unless  ADB  agrees  otherwise,  the  terms  for  such  onlending \narrangements  shall  include  (i)  commitment  charge  and  interest  at  rates  identical  to  those \napplied to the loan, (ii) a grace and principal repayment period identical to that applied to the \nloan, and (iii) the PMG bearing the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks. \n \n28.

The PMO will be directly in charge of procurement and \nsupervision of the project under PMTB oversight. County transport bureaus will have day-to-day \nmanagement  responsibility  for  the  outputs  concerning  rural  access  and  institutional \ndevelopment, under PMO guidance. A project management consultant, a procurement agent, \nand external environmental, resettlement, and ethnic minority monitors will support the PMO. \n \n ", "7 \n30.  Procurement  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The \nimplementation schedule incorporates procurement action before loan effectiveness. The PMG \nrequested  advance  contracting  and retroactive financing for  the  regional  roads  output  and \nrecruitment of the project management consultant. Advance contracting does not commit ADB \nto subsequently approve the project or finance the procurement costs. Retroactive financing will \napply to 20% of the loan proceeds, for expenditures incurred and paid for not earlier than \n12 months before the signing date of the loan agreement. \n \n31.  Five  of  the  10  Ning\u2019er\u2013Longfu  road  subgrade  contracts  and  the  Menglian\u2013Meng\u2019a \npavement contract will be government financed and tendered with the ADB-financed contracts. \nADB financing and procurement guidelines will be adopted for at least 150 km of rural roads that \nwill  be  designed,  tendered,  and  implemented  first.  The  remaining  rural  roads  will  be  fully \ngovernment funded and will follow the design, management, scheduling, and implementation \nprocedures used for the ADB-financed rural roads, and use domestic bidding procedures. \n \n32.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.22 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2014\u2013September 2020 \nEstimated completion date  30 December 2020 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Pu\u2019er Municipal Leading Group  \n(ii)   Executing agency  Pu\u2019er Municipal Government \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Pu\u2019er Municipal Transport Bureau \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management office; 6 staff \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  10 contracts  $186.7 \nmillion \nNational competitive bidding  Rural road packaging to be  $10.9 million \ndetermined \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  80 person-months   $2.0 million \nselection (80:20) \nIndividual consultant selection  50 person-months  $0.4 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting and retroactive financing is proposed for the consulting \nadvance contracting  services recruitment and the regional roads procurement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with Asian Development \nBank's (ADB) Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n33.  The project includes roads of class I, II, III, and IV. Road designs will be based on PRC \nstandards, with site-appropriate adjustments, particularly for road safety features.23 Road safety \naudits conducted during and after construction will ensure compliance with loan covenants and \nthe required road safety standards. \n                                                                                       \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 PRC Road Classification Information (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n34.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate \nof return of 14.5% and net present value of CNY706 million at a 12.0% discount rate. Costs \ninclude  investment  in  civil  works  and  equipment,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and \noperation and maintenance. Benefits include savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time, \nand improved road safety. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated robust economic viability. \n \n35.  Financial evaluation. The project has no revenue-generating components. Construction \nand incremental operating costs do not represent a substantial financial burden on the PMG, \nwhich has sufficient financial capacity to provide the required counterpart funds, cover operating \ncosts, and service the ADB loan. Financial management risks were assessed to be moderate. \nC.  Governance \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 22). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n37.  The  project  will  benefit  a  population  of  405,000.  Pu\u2019er\u2019s  nine  counties  are  national \npoverty counties. The average poverty incidence along the project roads is 36.9%, higher than \nthe 34.8% Pu\u2019er average. The project roads will serve the poor and non-poor by (i) reducing \ntransport  costs  and  increasing  profitability  of  cash  crops, (ii) increasing  access to  nonfarm \nemployment, and (iii) improving access to economic and employment opportunities and social \nservices. The project will stimulate investment, promoting growth of cash crops and the livestock \nindustry. An estimated 6,130 skilled and unskilled jobs will be created during construction, \ndirectly benefiting local people. The project is designated effective gender mainstreaming. The \ngender action plan identifies a lack of convenient transport services, and constraints imposed by \nlimited access, as the issues faced by women. The gender action plan responds by ensuring \n(i) women\u2019s equitable participation, and promotion of employment and income opportunities; \nand (ii) gender-responsive designs targeting village access and road safety improvements.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n38.  Environment (category A). A consolidated environmental impact assessment (EIA), \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), and environmental assessment and review framework \nhave  been  prepared  for  the  project.  These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC\u2019s  regulatory \nrequirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 13 June 2014. Public consultations informed the project design and EIA process, \nand will continue throughout project implementation. Anticipated environmental impacts and \nrisks are mostly modest and can be limited to an acceptable level through EMP implementation \nand  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The  EMP  outlines  potential  impacts,  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures,  institutional  arrangements,  training  requirements,  and  EMP \nimplementation budgets. The EMP implementation budget is 0.21% of the project budget. The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  sets  out  procedures  for  screening  and \nassessment  of  the  rural  roads  (output  2)  to  be  considered  after  loan  approval.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  strengthening  are  proposed  to  minimize  environmental  risks. \nEnvironmental complaints will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism. \n \n ", "9 \n39.  The project will result in the permanent loss of 925 hectares of land and temporary loss \nof 136 hectares, mostly modified habitats of limited value.24 Other negative impacts including \nnoise, dust, sedimentation, and erosion are short-term and localized. Road improvements will \nminimize dust and inefficient driving practices but overall, there will be increases in traffic noise, \npollutants, and greenhouse gas emissions during operation. Aggregate carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nemissions from projected traffic will be 278,375 tons per annum by 2030. This exceeds the \nSafeguard Policy Statement\u2019s emission threshold and requires annual reporting. \n \n40.  Regional road improvements will enhance border access. A due diligence study on \nwildlife trafficking concluded that increased trafficking could be an induced project impact. A \nrange of mitigation measures\u2014such as capacity building of border control staff, awareness \nraising, and improvement of coordination mechanisms between government agencies\u2014will be \nimplemented through the institutional development output. \n \n41.  Climate change. Initial climate risk screening determined that the project is at high risk \nfrom climate change effects. A detailed climate risk and vulnerability analysis determined the \nnature and level of project risks and specified design features to mitigate the project risks.25 \n \n42.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR) \nimpacts are attributable to the regional roads component. The two full resettlement plans for the \nregional roads address the LAR impacts.26 The estimated permanent land acquisition is 4,265.5 \nmu, including paddy land, non-irrigated farmland, forestry land, house plots, and other land.27 \nPermanent land acquisition will partially affect 3,998 households with 15,127 people. The total \narea of house and building demolition amounts to 83,155 square meters, involving residential \nhouses and simple structures, and will affect 600 households with 2,368 people. Overall, an \nestimated 17,495 persons from 4,598 rural households will be affected. Rural roads are unlikely \nto result in significant LAR impacts. To ensure LAR impacts are managed, a resettlement \nframework  with  two  short  sample  resettlement  plans  was  prepared.28 These  documents \nadequately deal with LAR impacts. \n \n43.  LAR costs are estimated at CNY358.54 million and include land compensation, house \nrelocation, livelihood support, taxes, fees, and contingency funding. The PMG confirmed that \nadequate counterpart funding will be made available for LAR. Resettlement implementation will \nbe monitored internally and externally. The PMO social safeguard unit will (i) coordinate internal \nsupervision, (ii) report on plan implementation, and (iii) engage an independent external monitor \nfor  semiannual  monitoring  and  reporting.  Public  consultations  will  continue  throughout  the \nproject cycle. Capacity development and institutional strengthening will minimize LAR risks. A \ngrievance redress mechanism will be established before LAR starts. Grievances will be resolved \nand documented in a timely manner. \n \n44.  Indigenous  peoples  (ethnic  minorities)  (category  A).  About  71%  of  the  project \nbeneficiaries represent ethnic minorities. The PMG prepared an ethnic minority development \nplan to ensure the project does not adversely impact ethnic minority communities and that \nethnic minorities actively participate and benefit in a culturally appropriate way. Investigations \n                                                                                       \n24 These estimates were from the feasibility study report and EIA report and include land use types over and above \nthose considered in the resettlement plan. Following detailed design and finalization of the resettlement plan, these \nfigures should be updated. \n25 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement\u20141 hectare = 15 mu; 1 mu = 666.7 square meters.  \n28 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nfound that improved access may increase the Wa and Lahu ethnic minorities\u2019 vulnerability to \nhuman and drug trafficking risks. Measures are incorporated in the ethnic minority development \nplan to complement the government\u2019s existing programs. The plan adequately deals with the \nidentified risks. The plan is posted on the ADB website and has been disclosed to the ethnic \nminority communities in the project area. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n45.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The integrated benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Further analysis and detailed descriptions are \nprovided in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInexperience of  Training on ADB requirements and procedures will be undertaken at loan inception.

Through a loan assurance, the PMG has agreed \ncounterpart financing  to ensure timely provision of counterpart funding. \nProject may induce  Targeted project interventions will enhance community awareness and develop \ncross-border trafficking  enforcement capacity to combat human, drug, and wildlife trafficking. Cooperation with \nADB regional technical assistance will increase the effectiveness of project interventions \naimed at combating wildlife trafficking. Representatives from provincial authorities \nresponsible for trafficking control will be represented on the project steering committee. \nThe executing agency has committed to provide budget allocations to finance the project \ntrafficking mitigating measures. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMG = Pu\u2019er Municipal Government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n46.  The government and the PMG have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan and project documents. The \ngovernment and the PMG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Yunnan Pu\u2019er Regional Integrated Road \nNetwork  Development  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \nTakehiko Nakao \n                                                                        President \n17 November 2014\n                                                                                       \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nRegional integration and  Value of trade at Meng\u2019a and  Yunnan Pu\u2019er Statistical  Supportive trade \ntrade between Yunnan  Longfu border crossings  Yearbook  agreements established \nPu\u2019er and neighboring  increased by 100% by 2023  PRC Customs Office  between the PRC and \ncountries is enhanced.
