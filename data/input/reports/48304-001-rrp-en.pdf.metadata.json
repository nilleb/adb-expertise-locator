They play an indispensable role in helping lower-income people obtain access \nto  finance  and  mitigate  the  adversities  stemming  from  the  unreliability  of  their  income.  MFIs \nhave  become  vital  in  delivering  credit  and  financial  services  to  the  smallest  and  remotest \nsegments  of  the  lower-income  population,  i.e.,  those  deemed  least  creditworthy,  who  do  not \nhave direct access to credit from commercial banking systems in developing member countries \n(DMCs). This microfinance ecosystem comprises (i) consumers or end-borrowers who rightfully \nexpect sustained access to financial services on fair and transparent terms; (ii) MFIs with vastly \nvarying business and operating models which deliver these services; (iii) a divergent set of MFI \nfinanciers, ranging from commercial lenders and for-profit investors to multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment  banks,  and  aid  and  donor  agencies  with  some  overlapping  interests;  and  (iv) \nregulators,  which  bear  the  overwhelming  responsibility  of  setting  the  standards  and  crisis \nprevention rules, while allowing generally unhindered entry to players in the sector. \n \n3. \nWhile the prominence and outreach of MFIs has increased, this has also resulted in an \nexcess  lending  capacity  within  certain  countries  and  sub-locations,  increasing  competition, \nfocus  on  short-term  profitability  and  growth,  and  inadequate  attention  to  internal  processes \nrelating  to  client  evaluation,  arrears  and  recovery  practices,  and  risk  management.  These \nfactors  have,  in  some  instances,  resulted  in  over-indebtedness,  heightened  systemic  risks  of \ncontagion, and strict regulatory actions in some DMCs.2  \n\n \nMFIs are also required to perform several critical functions and adhere to standards that \n4. \ncan extend substantially beyond the requirements stipulated by local regulators to sustain their \nlending  operations.  The  challenges  faced  by  MFIs  and  the  spill  over  effect  of  these  into \naccessing  institutional  finance  are  well  captured  in  the  annual  Microfinance  Banana  Skins \nsurveys.3  These  reports  have  consistently  found  unregulated  operations,  weak  credit  control, \ninadequate quality of management and governance, and mismanagement of market competition \nto be key industry risks. At the other end in this ecosystem, financiers can also face significant \nchallenges  in  dealing  with  MFIs.  The  increasing  variability  in  MFI  operating  models, \nunsophisticated  accounting  and  disclosure  practices  in  certain  instances,  and  portfolio \nmanagement and data quality issues can pose unanticipated credit and reputational risks. This \n\n                                                 \n\n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.  Faster Approach to Small Nonsovereign Transactions.  Manila. \n2   For example, the measures introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in August 2012 and July 2014,  which \nplaced caps on interest rates and loan processing fees, loan amounts, tenors, and maximum allowable loans per \nborrower, were undertaken to limit over-indebtedness and ensure fair practices.  \n\n3   The  survey  is  conducted  by  the  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Financial  Innovation.  Microfinance  Banana  Skins  2014 \ndescribes the risks facing the microfinance industry as seen by an international sample of practitioners, investors, \nregulators,  and  observers.  This  survey  was  conducted  in  January  and  February  2014  and  is  based  on \n306 responses from 70 countries. It updates previous surveys carried out in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012. \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nwidening  gap  between  the  financier\u2019s  understanding  of  MFI  operations;  and  the  latter\u2019s \nsometimes  limited  abilities  to  enhance  their  operating  and  disclosure  standards,  creates  the \nbusiness  opportunity  for  specialized  unbiased third-party  advisory  and rating service providers \nlike M-CRIL.  \n \nThe investment identification process for the project attempted to bridge these separate \n\n5. \nbut  intertwined  issues  and  strengthen  the  ecosystem  of  microfinance  thereby  increasing   \nprivate sector investment in this sector.4 The investment opportunity was selected after detailed \ncomparative  assessments.  Micro-Credit  Ratings  International  Limited  (M-CRIL)  was  selected \nbecause  of  its  relative  advantages  and  competitive  strengths  as  compared  with  other  micro-\ncredit  ratings  agencies  serving  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  M-CRIL  is  a  specialized  advisory, \nratings, policy-research, and training company of global repute. There are 3 global specialized \nmicrofinance  rating  agencies  and  M-CRIL  together  with  Microfinanza,  actively  covers  Asia.  It \nfocuses  on  the  financial,  social,  and  developmental  aspects  of  the  microfinance  ecosystem.5 \nInvesting  in  M-CRIL  will  help  strengthen  the  microfinance  system  in  countries  in  which  it  is \ncurrently operational (India and Myanmar, where M-CRIL has established offices) and assist it \nto expand elsewhere in emerging Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, and the People's Republic \nof China [PRC] markets  which are presently being covered from the existing offices). In India, \nADB\u2019s investment is critical for M-CRIL to obtain registration with the Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India (SEBI) and accreditation from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a credit rating \nagency (CRA).6 M-CRIL\u2019s rating activities are currently limited to select MFIs and their specific \nloan  portfolios,  as  permitted  by  applicable  regulations. While  commercial  banks  which  lend  to \nMFIs (or purchase securities) in India can still benefit from M-CRIL\u2019s ratings, the ratings cannot \nbe utilized for banks\u2019 capital-allocation decisions, posing a severe limitation on their application \nand on the overall business model of M-CRIL.   \n \n6. \nThe proposed investment builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing and previous engagement with MFIs. \nOver the past 3 decades, the involvement of ADB's Private Sector Operations Department with \nMFIs  has  largely  been  a  subset  of  its  work  on  enabling  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprise financing, which primarily involves extending long-term credit lines for on-lending to \nspecified  borrowers  such  as  MFIs;  a  pillar  in  this  initiative  was  the  Microfinance  Risk \nParticipation  and  Guarantee  Program.7  The  investment  in  M-CRIL  will  strengthen  institutional \ncapacities  within  the  sector,  which  will  substantially  supplement  ongoing  funding  and  will \nultimately broaden access to finance for lower-income borrowers. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n4   The  critical  consideration  for  lenders  and  financiers  here  is  not  limited  to  commercial  and  credit  risk-related \naspects,  but  on  the  fairness  and  transparency  with  which  MFIs  handle  their  borrowing  clients.  The  incidence  of \nMFIs  exploiting  the  vulnerability  of  borrowers  can  be  severely  detrimental  to  their  lenders  or  financiers  from  a \nreputational aspect.   \n\n5  In  several  countries,  private  and  state-owned  banks  that  are  unable  or  ill-positioned  to  cover  this  underserved \ncategory now use MFIs as agents or independent channel to deliver credit, savings, insurance, and other financial \nproducts and services.   \n\n6   Applicable SEBI regulations require that a CRA have a minimum net worth of Rs50 million, in addition to which the \nCRA must have a promoter shareholder (holding at least 10% of the CRA) meeting certain eligibility criteria, one of \nwhich is a minimum net worth of Rs1 billion. In the absence of CRA accreditation, M-CRIL is unable to rate public \nsecurities, and its ratings cannot be used by banks for capital adequacy purposes. It is expected that  M-CRIL will \nmeet these and other applicable requirements once ADB\u2019s investment enables M-CRIL to serve these markets. \n7   ADB.  2010.  The  Microfinance  Risk  Participating  and  Guarantee  Program.  Manila.  The  $190  million  program \nprovides  guarantees  and  risk  participations  for  loans  made  by  commercial  banks  for  MFIs  in  South  Asia.  An \nadditional amount of $50 million was approved under this program in October 2015. As of 2016, the program has \nsupported 19 MFIs, and approximately $370 million of loans were facilitated, supporting over 2 million borrowers, \n97% of whom are women.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nits \n\nfocus  on \n\nB. \n \n7. \nGiven  the  long-dated  track  record,  client-profile  consisting  of  eminent  commercial  and \ndevelopmental institutions, and its prominent coverage in Asia; M-CRIL is considered to be one \nof the most reputable and established independent agencies for microfinance related advisory, \nratings,  policy-research,  and  publication-focused  services  in  the  region.  It  offers  a  well-\ndiversified  range  of  products  while  simultaneously  maintaining \nits  core \ncompetencies of MFI assessments and ratings, which cover financial performance, governance \nand  transparency,  operations  and  portfolio  quality,  and  social  performance.  As  a  pioneer  in \ndeveloping  rating  frameworks  and  related  assessment  services,  M-CRIL  has  completed  over \n1,500 microfinance ratings, assessments, portfolio audits, evaluations, business planning review \nexercises,  risk-diagnostic  assessments,  and  microfinance-related  sector  reviews  and  financial \nadvisory  assignments  across  32  countries.  ADB  also  has  a  long-standing  relationship  with  M-\nCRIL,  utilizing  the  company\u2019s  research,  training,  and  rating  expertise  in  supporting  ADB\u2019s \nmicrofinance lending operations.  \n \nM-CRIL  has  a three-pronged  strategy  that  will  be  facilitated  by  ADB\u2019s  investment. This \n8. \nentails  (i) \nits  parent,  EDA  Rural  Systems  Private  Limited  (EDA); \n(ii) strengthening  the  company\u2019s  staff,  resources,  and  internal  processes  to  expand  outreach \nand  market  share  in  India  once  it  obtains  CRA  accreditation;  and  (iii)  utilizing  its  current \nexperience,  skills,  competence,  and  client  relationships  to  widen  its  geographic  coverage  by \nestablishing more permanent operations in the identified key markets of Cambodia, Indonesia, \nMyanmar, Nepal, and the PRC. It is expected that M-CRIL will complete its overseas expansion \nbetween  fiscal  year  (FY)  2017  and  FY2020,  and  will  prioritize  Myanmar,  Indonesia,  and  the \nPRC8 in the first phase.  \n \n9. \nAfter  the  investment  and  subsequent  to  CRA  accreditation,  it  is  estimated that  M-CRIL \nwill  regain  market  share  in  its  domestic  MFI  ratings  business\u2014from  its  current  level  of  7%  to \nabout  20%.9  Growth  is  forecast  to  be  more  pronounced  in  2017\u20132018,  after  which  it  would \nnormalize to more moderate levels of 12%-15% per annum. Similarly, revenue growth in the key \nnon-rating  segments,  chiefly  the  Client  Protection  Principles  (CPP)10  and  the  social  impact \nratings  or  assessment,  which  constitute  50%  of  the  total  revenue  base,  is  expected  to \naccelerate  after  the  investment.11  The  proportion  of  its  domestic  and  overseas  revenues  is \nexpected to become equal (now 80% of revenues come from overseas operations).  \n\nthe  merger  with \n\n                                                 \n\n8    M-CRIL  has  some  experience  in  these  markets,  with  a  joint  venture  initiated  in  the  PRC,  which  later  had  to  be \ndissolved  because  of  an  internal  decision  of  its  partner.  M-CRIL  is  now  in  discussion  with  the  Fangzhun  Credit \nAnalysis Company of Shanghai for a new partnership. The timing for executing the expansion plans also depends \non obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.   \n\n9  This  is  a  conservative  estimate.    Prior  to  the  changes  in the  RBI\u2019s  accreditation  policies for  CRAs  (announced in \n2013), M-CRIL held a nearly 60% share of the MFI credit ratings business in India, which migrated to other CRAs \nafter  this  regulatory  change. M-CRIL  is  expected  to  re-attract  its  previous  clients,  which  are  still  dealing  with  the \ncompany  for  its  non-rating  services  (such  as  implementing the  Client  Protection  Principles  (CPP)  and  assessing \nsocial impacts), and are very familiar with M-CRIL\u2019s ratings approach, expertise and reputation, and understand the \nvalue that M-CRIL\u2019s work adds to their operations.  \n\n10 The CPP are defined in the Smart Campaign for Microfinance, which supports full transparency in pricing, terms, \nand  conditions  of  all  financial  products  offered  by  MFIs  to  their  lower-income  client  base.  Smart  Microfinance  is \nworking with clients  to prevent over-indebtedness  or purchase  of products they do not need or understand. CPP \nalso  involves  employing  respectful  collection  practices  and  adopting  high  ethical  standards  in  the  treatment  of \nclients.  \n\n11  This  business  segment  is  forecast  to  grow  at  a  faster  pace  in  2017\u20132018,  responding  to  new  staff  hiring  and \nopening  of  permanent  offices  in  other  DMC  markets.  This  will  increase  M-CRIL\u2019s  capacity  and  broad-base  its \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nEDA is engaged in the nonfinancial ratings-related businesses of microfinance and rural \n10. \ndevelopment, such as social performance ratings, assessment of financial inclusiveness, social \nimpact studies, and adoption of and training in CPP. With the merger of EDA and M-CRIL, the \nbusiness, product, and client portfolio of the combined entity will benefit from both revenue and \ngeographic  diversification,  lower  operating  costs,  and  reduced  organizational  redundancies, \nwhile still retaining overall focus and specialization. \n \nC.  \n \n11. \nOwnership. M-CRIL was established in 1999 in response to the need for performance \nassessments  of  small  microfinance  service  providers.  M-CRIL  was  developed  through  EDA, \nwhich  was  established  in  1983  and  holds  about  91%  of  M-CRIL;  the  balance  is  owned  by  M-\nCRIL  employees.  M-CRIL  and  EDA  are  about  to  merge  under  a  process  expected  to  be \ncompleted  by  July  2016.  M-CRIL  will  be  the  surviving  entity  carrying  on  the  combined \nbusinesses of M-CRIL and EDA. The founders of M-CRIL, Sanjay Sinha and Frances Sinha, are \nthe predominant owners of EDA, together holding almost 100% (with a small minority share held \nby  a  key  employee).  M-CRIL  has  one  wholly  owned  subsidiary  incorporated  in  Myanmar, \nestablished to carry on its operations there.12 Due diligence was conducted in accordance with \nthe  Integrity  Due  Diligence  Guidelines  for  Nonsovereign  Operations,  and  no  significant  or \npotentially significant integrity issues were identified.13 \n\n \n12. \n Completion  of  the  merger  between  M-CRIL  and  EDA  will  be  a  condition  precedent  to \nADB\u2019s investment and will result in the creation of a full-service entity covering both the financial \nand the social aspects of microfinance. The merged entity will have  a wider revenue, product, \nand client  base with  unaudited  combined revenues  of  about  Rs90  million  and  a  combined net \nworth of about Rs85 million as of FY2016. The founders have also initiated measures to transfer \nownership  of  part  of  the  company  to  key  staff  pursuant  to  an  employee  stock  option  plan.  By \nFY2020, after the merger and after full deployment of ADB\u2019s investment, ownership of M-CRIL \nis expected to be shared by the founders (60%), ADB (25%), and employees (15%). \n \n13.  Management  and  governance  structure.  M-CRIL  is  professionally  managed,  with  a \nstrong  team  of  experienced  and  well-qualified  staff  in  various  positions  across  its  business \ndevelopment,  analytical  and  financial  analysis  functions,  operations,  and  research  and \npublications.  M-CRIL  understands  the  need  to  further  strengthen  the  management  team, \nstreamline  its  internal  processes,  and  bring  greater  specialization  and  decentralization  to  its \noperations as a critical part of its post-investment activities.  \n \n14. \nDespite  its  historically  closely  held  ownership,  M-CRIL  follows  high  standards  of \ntransparency  and  governance  and  has  established  a  board  with  strong  backgrounds  and \nexperiences  in  finance  sector  regulation,  MFI  industry  operations,  rural  and  commercial \nbanking,  and  academia,  to  oversee  its  operations.  Five  of  the  seven  board  members  are \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                             \n\npresence  for  such  assignments.  As  these  services  are  also  often  bundled  with  financial  ratings,  these  will  likely \nincrease in tandem. \n\n12  Sanjay Sinha directly owns 0.004% (1 share) of M-CRIL Myanmar Limited.  \n13 In March 2016, the United States Treasury issued an advisory that Myanmar had made progress in substantially \naddressing  the  FATF  action  plan  at  a  technical  level.  Consequently,  FATF  removed  Myanmar  from  the  FATF \nPublic  Statement  and  now  includes  the  jurisdiction  in  its  Improving  Global  Anti  Money  Laundering  (AML)  and \nCountering  Financing  of  Terrorism (CFT)  Compliance  ongoing  process.  Myanmar  is  not a  member of  the  Global \nForum  on  Transparency  and  Exchange  of  Information  for  Tax  Purposes  and  has  thus  not  been  rated.  Due \ndiligence  in  relation  to  M-CRIL's  relatively  minor  Myanmar  operations  has  been  undertaken  and  no  material \nintegrity risks were identified.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nindependent; the chairman (Malcolm Harper) is a globally renowned expert in microfinance and \nsocial  development.  The  board  meets  at  least  four  times  a  year  to  oversee  the  company\u2019s \noperations;  assesses  and  helps  direct  key  businesses,  reviews  the  human  resource  strategy \nand  policies,  and  decisions  related  to  investment  or  expansion;  and  provides  independent \noversight of the analytical rigor and consistency of M-CRIL\u2019s products and services.  \n\n15.  M-CRIL  follows  a  well-established  protocol  in  the  conduct  of  its  social  and  financial \nratings  and  assessments.  The  rating  process  starts  with  desk  analysis  of  information  and  a \nsubsequent field visit to the head office and operational branches, and the borrowers of the MFI. \nUnlike  mainstream  rating  agencies,  intensive  field  visits  and  interaction  with  clients  are  at  the \ncore of the M-CRIL approach. The M-CRIL ratings team prepares a detailed assessment report, \ncross-checks  the  data  with  the  specific  MFI  (without  discussing  or  disclosing  the  rating),  and \nsubsequently  ensures  an  adequate  quality  review  by  its  senior  management.  As  M-CRIL  has \nperformed reviews, assessments, and diagnostics on MFIs in the same geographic region, it is \nwell placed for a comparative analysis and performance benchmarking. The final report, along \nwith additional factual details and data provided by the rated institution, is submitted to the rating \ncommittee, composed entirely of independent microfinance experts. \n \nD.  \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \n\n \n\n16.  M-CRIL\u2019s  financial  performance  is  characterized  by  stable  revenue  growth,  which \nbenefits substantially from the wide range of services and a diverse client profile. As discussed, \nthe effect of the rapid tapering in its ratings-related business was offset by rising contributions \nfrom CPP assessments, client certifications, and social performance ratings of MFIs (Table 1). \nThe technical assistance and advisory work, which is usually linked to larger-scale projects with \nlonger  completion  cycles,  also  mitigated  this  impact.  Notwithstanding  this  variability,  M-CRIL\u2019s \nrevenues grew by an average of 15% in 2008\u20132015, with a tapering effect in the latter years. \n\n \nTable 1: Revenue Share by Segment \n\nRevenue Share by Segment\nCredit Rating\nResearch/Assessment/Social Performance\nTechnical Assistance, Advisory \nOthers\nTraining\nLivelihoods Programs\nConsolidated revenue\n\n2010-11\n41.9%\n20.0%\n8.5%\n5.9%\n7.1%\n16.6%\n100.0%\n\n2011-12\n60.6%\n17.1%\n5.9%\n0.2%\n0.0%\n16.2%\n100.0%\n\n2012-13\n22.2%\n18.9%\n33.7%\n3.1%\n1.3%\n21.0%\n100.0%\n\n2013-14\n12.6%\n39.1%\n28.6%\n0.4%\n12.1%\n7.2%\n100.0%\n\n2014-15\n10.4%\n43.4%\n21.0%\n2.4%\n4.0%\n18.9%\n100.0%\n\n \n\n \n17.  M-CRIL has maintained relatively steady operating and earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation,  and  amortization  margins  since  FY2010,  after  bringing \nthe  requisite \nadjustments.  M-CRIL\u2019s  cost  base  primarily  consists  of  salaries  for  staff  and  fixed  operating \nexpenses (about 80% of costs), making the number and client-profile of completed assignments \na  key  driver  of  operating  profitability.  The  overseas  assignments  tend  to  have  better  payment \nterms and make a dominant contribution to profits, although they typically block staff resources \nfor  longer  periods.  The  domestic  assignments,  specifically  ratings,  are  on  more  price-\ncompetitive terms, but tend to be shorter engagements and allow for higher staff rotation. Given \nthat  the  share  of  these  two  markets  will  remain  roughly  equal,  the  earnings  before  interest, \ntaxes,  depreciation,  and  amortization  margin  is  expected  to  improve  to  18%\u201320%  (from  a \ncurrent average of about 15%), with a build-up in domestic ratings.  M-CRIL\u2019s move to its own \npremises  in  the  second  quarter  of  2015  removed  the  drag  of  rental  payments.  M-CRIL  has \nconsistently  ploughed  back  all  earnings,  declaring  no  dividends,  which  reflects  the  founders\u2019 \napproach to building the organization.  \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n18. \nGiven  its  relatively  simple  business  model  and  conservative  accounting  treatment,  M-\nCRIL\u2019s  balance  sheet  position  reflects  (i)  substantial  liquidity  (current  ratio  in  excess  of  5x); \n(ii) consistent  debt-free  position;  (iii)  deployment  of  profits  into  liquid  investments  (cash  and \nbank  balances  average  20%  of  assets);  (iv)  M-CRIL\u2019s  office  premises  (book  value  of  about \nRs30 million, current market value higher); and (v) a reasonably managed working capital cycle.  \nThe deposits and investments are a source of interest or dividend income to the company. \n\n19.  M-CRIL\u2019s  historical  focus  has  been  on  delivering  outstanding  work  quality  and \npositioning itself as a practice leader in microfinance activities in the region, rather than pursuing \nmarket share and higher volumes of assignments. M-CRIL\u2019s founders and staff actively pursue \nseveral  publication  and  representation  activities,  which  showcase \ntechnical \ncompetence  and  build  its  brand  equity  even  if  these  may  not  be  directly  revenue-accretive. \nDespite its focus on setting eminent standards through its work, M-CRIL\u2019s 5-year average return \non  assets  is  at  9%,  and  return  on  equity  is  at  13%.  Given  the  sustained  profitability  and \nreinvestment of all earnings, the book value of M-CRIL\u2019s shares increased by 1.7x over a 5-year \nperiod. In the context of the company\u2019s business, a liability-free status and clear capital structure \nare good indicators of the shareholder value created by the company.  \n \n\nfirm\u2019s \n\nthe \n\nIII. \n\nTHE ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe ADB assistance consists of an equity investment of the Indian rupee equivalent of \nup to $1.5 million in the form of new shares to be issued by M-CRIL after its merger with EDA. \nThis is expected to constitute 25% of the share capital of the company.14 ADB will have the right \nto  nominate  a  board  member,  and  minority  protection  rights  consistent  with  those  usually \nobtained by ADB for such investments.  \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  investment  will  (i)  bolster  M-CRIL\u2019s  balance  sheet  to  enable  it  to  pursue  its \nexpansion in the DMCs outlined above; (ii) assist with institutional strengthening to enhance its \ndomestic  operations;  and  (iii)  facilitate  M-CRIL\u2019s  transition  to  an  accredited  CRA.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment  plan  will  follow  a  phased  approach  matched  to  achieving  CRA  accreditation, \nimplementing the employee stock option plan, and ensuring compliance with ADB\u2019s investment \nlimits. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n14 ADB\u2019s investment will not exceed 25% of M-CRIL\u2019s issued share capital nor result in ADB being the single largest \n\n                                                 \n\nshareholder of M-CRIL. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nB. \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  monitor  the  project.  M-CRIL  will \nprovide  ADB  with  financial  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals.  These  will  include \n(i) quarterly reporting of key financial parameters, (ii) audited financial statements on an annual \nbasis,  and  (iii)  annual  reporting  on  selected  development  indicators  agreed  by  ADB  and  M-\nCRIL.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  regularly  and  at  least \nannually.15 The first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \nAs  a condition  precedent  to ADB\u2019s  investment,  M-CRIL  will  be  required  to provide  a  business \nplan  that  outlines  the  next  steps  toward  (i)  regulatory  approvals  for  accreditation  in  India; \n(ii) regional  expansion  in  the  pre-specified  markets  by  opening  regional  or  in-country  offices; \nand  (iii)  strengthening  the  organizational  resources  and  skills  base  by  hiring  staff,  providing \ntraining, and upgrading its information technology.  \n \nC.  \n \n23. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB is expected to provide the following value additions: \n(i) \n\nSupport financial inclusion. ADB\u2019s funding will help  M-CRIL further expand in \nIndia and across Asia, creating opportunities to service a much wider client base \nof MFIs that lend to lower-income borrowers.   \nStrengthen  microfinance  industry  and  catalyze  private  sector  funding  for \nmicrofinance  institutions.  Providing  uniform  and  transparent  credit  ratings \nagainst industry benchmarks and across multiple countries is expected to provide \ncomfort  to  private  sector  financiers,  thereby  directing  incremental  capital  to  this \nindustry.  \nCreate  value  as  a  strategic  shareholder.  The  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  investment \nwill  help  support  M-CRIL\u2019s  capital  requirements  until  FY2019.  As  a  strategic \npartner,  ADB  will  provide  value  through  a  nominee  director  to  the  board  and \npotentially  attract  future  funding.  Importantly,  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  enable  M-\nCRIL to qualify as an accredited CRA in India.   \nSupport  women  borrowers.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  help  improve  access  to \nfinance for  women,  who  are  the  predominant  borrowers from  MFIs.  The project \nhas  been  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  will  further  boost \nsupport to women. \n\nKey risks of the proposed project are:   \n(i) \n\nCapacity  risks.  The  founders\u2019  and  management\u2019s  ability  to  scale  up  M-CRIL\u2019s \noperations  and  execute  them  under  the  proposed  business  plan  is  a  key  risk. \nHowever, M-CRIL\u2019s track record in these markets, its ability to attract and retain \nstaff, the employee stock option plan, and the institutional links with ADB will help \nminimize this risk. \nRegulatory  risks.  The  microfinance  sector  remains  exposed  to  regulatory \nchanges,  particularly  as  various  regulators  seek  to  strengthen  their  supervisory \noversight  of  MFIs.  Historically,  however,  the  alignment  between  the  regulators\u2019 \npriorities  and  M-CRIL\u2019s  role  in  strengthening  the  microfinance  ecosystem  has \nbeen high.  \n\n                                                 \n\n15 ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(ii) \n\n \nD.    Risks \n \n24. \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSector  concentration  risk.  M-CRIL  has  acquired  noteworthy  competencies, \nreputation,  and  a  position  of  expertise  in  the  microfinance  ecosystem,  but  it \nremains  focused  on  this  segment.  Historically,  however,  M-CRIL  has  shown  its \nability to grow its relevance  in line  with the evolving priorities of stakeholders in \nthe MFI sector.  \nKey  person  and  transition  risks.  Given  the  long  history  of  the  founders\u2019 \ninvolvement and the strong brand association, a key person risk exists. However, \nthis risk should decline over time as the founders are transitioning M-CRIL to an \neven  more  professionally  managed  and  employee-owned  company.  The \nfounders  are  also  implementing  decentralization  initiatives.  The  founders  have \ncommitted  to  retaining  the  majority  ownership  of  M-CRIL  while  ADB  remains  a \nshareholder. \nReputational  risk.    ADB\u2019s  investment  will  allow  M-CRIL  to  graduate  to  an \neligible  CRA  status  in  India.  Various  funders  or  other  stakeholders  supporting \nfinancial  inclusion  initiatives  may  associate  ADB\u2019s  name  with  the  company  and \nits  products.    Should  the  company  be  unsuccessful  in  its  business  plan,  there \nmay be an implied expectation of additional support from ADB, given its visibility \nas a large institution.  The most important safeguard against reputational risk is \nthe long-run track record of M-CRIL\u2019s and EDA\u2019s operations. \nExit  risk.  The  entry  valuation  assumes  an  adequately  conservative  growth \nprojection, which lowers the risk of ADB overpaying on its investment. However, \ninvesting in a small organization in a specialized field limits the exit options. ADB \nhas  sought  to  minimize  this  risk  by  negotiating  a  broad  range  of  exit  rights, \nincluding buyback arrangements for its stake.  \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA.  \n \n25. \nProject output and outcome. The core outputs of ADB\u2019s investment of growth capital \ninto  M-CRIL  are  the  (i) establishment  of  M-CRIL  as a regional,  professionally  managed  entity, \noffering  a  diverse  suite  of  MFI  assessment,  advisory,  and  social  and  financial  rating  services; \nand (ii) establishment of M-CRIL as an accredited CRA in India.   \n \n26. \nThe core outcome will be sustained poverty reduction in the region through MFI lending \nthat is pro-poor, protects client interests, and is undertaken in a socially responsible manner. A \nwider  application  of  services  by  M-CRIL  and  associated  improvements  made  by  the  MFIs  will \nlead to sustained access to funding from financiers, resulting in an expansion of the coverage \nareas and client  base of  these entities.  The proposed investment  sets  a good example of  the \nFinance++ approach, a step in fostering transfer of knowledge and skills within the Asian region. \nM-CRIL  will  also  have  an  opportunity  to  extensively  capitalize  on  ADB\u2019s  internal  knowledge \nbase and long-established support and involvement in developing rating agencies in Asia.16 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n16 This investment will utilize the expertise developed through the Office of Regional Integration and  its work with the \nAssociation  of  Asian  Credit  Rating  Agencies, along  with  ADB\u2019s  balance-sheet-based  investing capacity,  to  foster \nregional expansion of locally developed institutions like M-CRIL. \n\n\f \n\n \nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nB. \n \nFinance  sector  development  is  listed  as  one of five core  specializations for  operational \n27. \nfocus  under  Strategy  2020,  and  re-emphasized  in  the  midterm  review  of  April  2014.17  This, \nalong  with  the  related  midterm  review  objectives\u2014consumer  protection,  financial  literacy, \ndevelopment  of  regulatory  and  supervisory  frameworks,  as  well  as  investment  in  risk \nmanagement  policies,  for  covering  the  unserved  and  underserved  populations\u2014fits  very \nstrongly with the core objectives of the proposed equity investment in M-CRIL.   \n \n28. \nAccording to the country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign \noperations  will  continue  to  support  the  infrastructure  and  finance  sectors  by  undertaking \nselective  projects  for  physical  and  social  infrastructure  and  financial  infrastructure.18  The \nproposed transaction will support the development of microfinance in India, one of the financial \ninfrastructures  identified  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  a  high  priority  for  the \ngovernment with growing emphasis on including private sector financing. Within this domain, the \ngovernment  and  regulators  have  strongly  emphasized  better  standards  of  transparency, \ngovernance,  risk  management  and  reporting  for  MFIs,  which  is  the  key  thematic  focus  of  the \nproposed  investment.19  This  investment  also  supports  various  other  country  partnership \nstrategies related to the project.20 \n\n \n29. \nIn  2000,  recognizing  that  the  financial  landscape  had  changed,  ADB  formulated  and \napproved  the  Microfinance  Development  Strategy,  which  identifies  inadequate  financial \ninfrastructure,  more  specifically  regulatory  and  supervisory  systems,  as  a  constraint  to  further \ngrowth of MFIs. The Microfinance Development Strategy also names investing and \u201cdeveloping \nfinancial  infrastructure\u201d  as  a  key  component  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy.  Investing  in  M-CRIL \naligns  very  well  with  these  recommendations,  by  delivering  a  very  high  multiplier  impact  from \nthe  investment.  This  positive  attribute  was  also  very  well  established  in  the  previous  three \ninvestments by ADB\u2014in CRISIL India, Rating Agency Malaysia, and Thailand Rating Services \nLimited,  which  became  pillar  institutions  in  their  local  markets  and  yielded  very  positive \ndevelopmental  results  for  ADB.  Since  the  microfinance  client  base  consists  predominantly  of \nwomen  and  the  investment\u2019s  objective  is  sustained  and  fair  access  to  credit  and  financial \nservices for MFI borrowers, M-CRIL also links well with the priorities identified in ADB\u2019s Gender \nEquality and Women's Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.21  \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  proposed  investment  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \n30. \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).

M-CRIL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards.22  M-CRIL  will  report  regularly  to ADB  on  its  compliance with \nsuch laws and the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements. \n \n31. \nThe  investment  in  M-CRIL  is  expected  to  result  in  greater  access  to  finance  for  low-\nincome borrowers, comprising 90% women in mostly rural and semiurban areas, and has been \ncategorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  M-CRIL  has  prepared  and  is  committed  to \nimplementing  a  gender  action  plan  outlining  the  activities  and  targets  to  achieve  greater \nfinancial access for low-income borrowers, predominantly women.  \n \nB. \n \n32.  M-CRIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.

MFIs play an indispensable role in helping the poor obtain access to \nfinance and mitigating the adversities stemming from the unreliability of their income. MFIs have \nbecome  essential  in  delivering  credit  and  financial  services  to  the  smallest  and  remotest \nsegments of lower-income populations, i.e., those deemed least creditworthy, who do not have \ndirect access to credit from the commercial banking systems in DMCs.1 \n \n2. \nMFIs  rely  on  wholesale  sources  of  debt  or  subordinated  funding\u2014principally  through \ncommercial banks, DFIs, foundations, trusts, and private equity or capital asset managers\u2014to \nfund  their  onlending  operations.  Most  DMCs  and  their  banking  sector  regulators  do  not  allow \nMFIs to access retail deposits, which arguably is the correct approach since MFIs\u2019 capitalization \nlevels,  access  to  liquidity,  and  overall  risk  management  and  governance  standards  are  still \nevolving, making them financially susceptible and less creditworthy for directly accessing public \nsavings.2 Further, while regulatory oversight of MFIs is steadily improving, it is often as a sharp \nresponse to MFI credit-risk and governance crises,3 usually constraining liquidity and access to \nfunding  for  even  the  better-managed  and  better-governed  MFIs.  Figure  1  shows  the  capital-\nstructure  profile  of  a  regionally  diverse  sample  of  MFIs,  which  underscores  the  point  about \ndependence  on  institutional  debt,  and  the  diminishing  contribution  of  public  or  client  savings. \nThe immediate future is likely to reflect further reliance on external debt since access to equity \nand  contributions  of  earnings  have  been  constricted,  and  MFI  earnings  have  generally  come \nunder pressure from greater competition and more credit losses. This trend highlights the role \nand  contribution  of  the  kind  of  risk  assessment  work  undertaken  by  Micro-Credit  Ratings \nInternational Limited (MCRIL) for the debt providers. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  In several countries, where private and state-owned banks are ill-positioned to cover the vast market, they now use \nMFIs as a strategic choice\u2014as agents or an independent channel to deliver credit, savings, insurance, and other \nfinancial products and services to the underserved client category. This model of \u201ccorrespondent banking\u201d is using \nthe more nimble and widely present MFIs to widen coverage and source clients (borrowers and depositors) for the \nlarger commercial banks.  \n\n2  A recent example of this transition is the case of Bandhan Financial Services Private Limited in India, which was \ngranted an approval to start commercial banking operations and access to public deposits, although it will need to \nmaintain stringent capital, liquidity, and governance standards. Bandhan has a 15-year track record and relatively \nstrong governance and reporting standards; such qualities are not seen often in MFIs. \n\n3   The  MFI  crisis  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  India,  which  impacted  access  to  funding  for  all  institutions  across  India,  was \noften  cited  as  an  outcome  of  changes  in  the  external  operating  environment.  Similar  MFI  crises  of  individual \ninstitutions, and their sector-wide impact, were seen in the PRC, Indonesia, and the Philippines. \n\n\f \n\n75.0%\n\n60.0%\n\n45.0%\n\n30.0%\n\n15.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n \n\nFigure 1: Capital-Structure Profile \n\n%\n5\n.\n4\n6\n\n%\n5\n.\n3\n6\n\n%\n7\n.\n0\n6\n\n%\n7\n.\n4\n6\n\n%\n3\n.\n5\n6\n\n%\n7\n.\n2\n6\n\n%\n7\n.\n1\n1\n\n%\n1\n.\n2\n1\n\n%\n9\n.\n5\n\n%\n8\n.\n5\n\n%\n0\n.\n2\n1\n\n%\n7\n.\n0\n1\n\n%\n0\n.\n9\n\n%\n9\n.\n4\n\n%\n3\n.\n4\n1\n\n%\n8\n.\n1\n1\n\n%\n6\n.\n9\n\n%\n6\n.\n3\n\n%\n2\n.\n3\n1\n\n%\n4\n.\n2\n1\n\n%\n3\n.\n7\n\n%\n5\n.\n2\n\n%\n6\n.\n3\n1\n\n%\n0\n.\n2\n1\n\n%\n6\n.\n6\n\n%\n4\n.\n2\n\n%\n7\n.\n3\n1\n\n%\n6\n.\n2\n1\n\n%\n4\n.\n7\n\n%\n7\n.\n3\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\nDebt\n\nEquity\n\nGrant\n\nGuarantees\n\nStructured Finance\n\n \n\nSource: International Financial Inclusion Financing Data, 2015, Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). \n\n \n \nUniversally, both across emerging and well-established DMC markets, concerns persist \n3. \nregarding  disclosure,  governance,  and  accounting  standards  and  risk  management  in  the \ndevelopment of MFIs.4 While the very few larger and developed institutions have progressed to \nbetter  standards,  the  gap  in  the  requirements  of  the  risk  takers  (i.e.,  the  commercial  lenders) \nand  the  borrowing  MFIs  remains  vast.  This  information  gap  is  most  significant  for  portfolio \nquality  assessment,  which  is  often  not  adequately  and  transparently  evident  from  published \naccounts, and has generally been weakening, which only adds to the lenders\u2019 concern. Figure 2 \nprofiles  the  key  countries  or  markets  that  are  likely  to  be  vulnerable  to  loan  portfolio  quality \nconcerns,5 as reflected in high growth (y-axis) and penetration (x-axis) rates. For a majority of \nthe  DMCs,  it  is  forecast  that  loan  portfolios  will  weaken  from  current  levels  while  penetration \nrates increase, which directly signifies the importance and value addition of specialized MFI risk-\nassessment services.  \n\n                                                 \n4 Several independent assessments have consistently highlighted these concerns as the foremost DMC microfinance \nrisk  factor\u2014among others,  (i) the  Microfinance  Banana  Skins  reports  of 2012,  2013,  and 2015,  which are  global \nsurveys  of  microfinance  risks  as  seen  by  an  international  sample  of  practitioners,  investors,  regulators,  and \nobservers;  (ii) MicroRate  2013,  a  survey  of  microfinance  investment  vehicles;  (iii)  ResponsAbility  \u2013  Microfinance \nMarket Outlook 2014; (iv) The Impact Investor\u2019s Handbook \u2013 Lessons from the World of Microfinance (2011, 2014); \nand (v) Microfinance in South Asia \u2013 Towards Financial Inclusion for the Poor (World Bank). \n\n5 A PAR30 (which implies the value of all loans outstanding that have one or more installments of principal past due \nfor more than 30 days) is a standard indicator of portfolio quality, and levels above 5%\u20137% (of total portfolio) are \ngenerally considered risky.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Countries with Substantial Deterioration in the Quality of Microfinance \nInstitution Portfolios  \n\n \n\nThis anticipation further distorts risk assessment, increases risk aversion and transaction \n4. \ncosts  for  lenders,  and  negatively  impacts  the  MFIs\u2019  access  to  a  sustained  flow  of  long-term \nfunding to their onlending operations. The ability of a specialized agency such as MCRIL to offer \nthese risk advisory, assessment, and measurement services; reduce the transaction costs; and \nprovide a wider reference base for lenders is the key economic rationale for MCRIL's business \nand a core rationale for this investment.  \n \n5. \nRegulations. The regulations governing microfinance  activities  have  generally  focused \non reporting requirements and on setting minimum standards, which typically would allow a vast \narray of MFIs to continue their operations. Among the South Asian countries, Bangladesh, India, \nNepal, and Sri Lanka regulate MFIs by law. India, as the largest country in South Asia, has the \nmost  diversified  microfinance  service  providers\u2014banks,  nonbanking  financial  companies \n(NBFCs),  societies,  trusts,  and  cooperatives.  The  Microfinance  Institutions  (Development  and \nRegulation) Bill, 2012 was tabled in Parliament in May 2012 and was examined by the Standing \nCommittee  on  Finance,  but  is  still  to  be  enacted.  However,  considering  the  importance  of  the \nsector  and  the  lessons  from  the  Andhra  Pradesh  crisis,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  created  a \nseparate category of NBFCs, NBFC-MFIs, for extending loans to the microfinance sector. Since \nNBFC-MFIs  contribute  more  than  80%  of  the  outreach  and  microfinance  portfolio,  are  directly \nsupervised by the Reserve Bank, and operate under its directives, it can be said that the Indian \nmicrofinance sector is well regulated.  \n \n \n\n\fOWNERSHIP, MANAGEMENT, AND GOVERNANCE \n\nThe Company, Sponsors, and Management \n\n \nA. \n \nCompany ownership and history.  Micro-Credit Ratings International Limited (MCRIL) \n1. \nis engaged in the financial and social ratings of microfinance institutions (MFIs). It was one of \nfour  agencies  globally  that  first  specialized  in  microfinance  ratings.  MCRIL  was  established  in \n1998,  in  response  to  the  need  for  performance  assessments  of  small  microfinance  service \nproviders. It provides standard comparisons of the financial, management, and mission-oriented \nperformances  of  MFIs  to  facilitate  the  decision-making  process  of  investors  and  lenders.  The \nfoundation  for  MCRIL\u2019s  activities  was  laid  by  its  parent  company,  EDA  Rural  Systems  Private \nLimited  (EDA),  which  was  set  up  in  1983  and  has  undertaken  livelihood  assessments,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation of microfinance programs for over 25 years across Asia. MCRIL was \namong  the  first  agencies  to  be  accredited  by  the  IDB\u2013CGAP  Rating  Fund1  and  The  Rating \nInitiative of ADA, Luxembourg.2 \n \nAs a pioneer in developing rating frameworks and related assessment services, MCRIL \n2. \nhas  completed  over  1,500  microfinance  ratings,  assessments,  portfolio  audits,  evaluations, \nbusiness  planning  review  exercises,  risk-diagnostic  assessments,  and  microfinance-related \nsector  reviews  and  financial  advisory  assignments  across  32  countries,  and  has  undertaken \naround 420 school assessments. Since MCRIL has completed assignments and assessed MFIs \nin various regional markets over the past 8\u201310 years (specifically in DMCs such as Cambodia, \nIndonesia,  and  Nepal,  and  more  recently  in  markets  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC)  and  Myanmar),  it  is  now  well  placed  to  implement  its  strategic  plan  to  establish  a \npermanent presence and local operating base  in PRC. MCRIL\u2019s major  clients include : Asian \nDevelopment  Bank;  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom;  Food \nand  Agriculture  Organisation  of  the  United  Nations;  Ford  Foundation;  International  Finance \nCorporation;  Mekong  Private  Sector  Development  Facility;  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and \nRural  Development  in  India;  Pakistan  Microfinance  Network;  Rural  Microfinance  Development \nCentre  ,  Nepal;  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation;    United  Nations  Capital \nDevelopment Fund; World Bank, among others.  \n \n\n \nKey Services \n\nMCRIL \n\n \n\nEDA \n\nMicrofinance institutional ratings \nLoan portfolio audits \nClient protection assessments (SMART \nCampaign) \nSocial ratings, Truelift assessment \n\nValue chain assessments \nRatings of producer organizations \nEvaluations of microfinance program \nsupport \nSocial performance management  \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Inter-American  Development  Bank  (IADB)  and  the  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poorest  (CGAP)  have \nlaunched a joint initiative\u2014the Microfinance Rating and Assessment Fund (the Rating Fund)\u2014aimed at improving \nthe  quality,  reliability,  and  availability  of  information  on  the  risk  and  performance  of  MFIs.  The  Rating  Fund \nprovides partial financing of rating and assessment services for MFIs. It finances both financial and social impact \nratings or assessments of MFIs. \n\n2   The  Rating  Initiative  was  launched  by  the  Luxembourg  microfinance  agency  ADA  (Appui  au  D\u00e9veloppement \nAutonome),  in  collaboration  with  the  Government  of  Luxembourg,  Microfinance  Initiative  Liechtenstein  (MIL), \nSwiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Oxfam Novib, \u00d6sterreichische Entwicklungsbank (OeEB), the Principality \nof Monaco, responsAbility, BlueOrchard, and the Social Performance Task Force (SPTF). The project operates as \na  public\u2013private  partnership  and  part-finances  ratings  of  MFIs,  and  allows  MFI  lenders  and  investors  access  to \nspecific rating-related details.  \n\n\fStrategic business planning \nNGO assessments \nLow-cost school assessments \nFinancial inclusion studies  \nResearch and evaluation of microfinance and financial inclusion programs  \n\nsupport \nTraining of MFI managers, regulators, \npolicymakers, donor staff \nDocumentation of programs \n\n \n \n3. \nSponsors  and  founders.  EDA  owns  about  91%  of  MCRIL,  the  balance  is  owned  by \nMCRIL employees. MCRIL and EDA are merging under a process expected to be completed by \nJuly  2016.  MCRIL  will  be  the  surviving  entity  carrying  on  the  combined  businesses  of  MCRIL \nand  EDA.  The  founders  of  MCRIL,  Sanjay  Sinha  and  Francis  Sinha,  are  the  predominant \nowners of EDA, together holding almost 100% (with a small minority held by a key employee). \nMCRIL  has  one  wholly  owned  subsidiary  incorporated  in  Myanmar,  established  to  carry  on  its \noperations  there.  EDA  is  an  operating\u2013holding  entity  and  has  been  engaged  in  nonfinancial \nrating activities for the microfinance industry, such as social performance ratings, assessment of \ninclusiveness,  social  impact  studies,  adoption  of  the  Client  Protection  Principles  of  the  Smart \nCampaign, and training.  \n \n4. \nThe  ownership  structure  of  MCRIL  is  expected  to  evolve,  resulting  in  a  greater \nproportion  of  employee  shares  and  a  reduction  in  the  founders\u2019  ownership,  which  will  help \nfurther align the stakeholder interests in this very skills- and people-intensive business, and will \nstrengthen  the  long-term  commitment  of key  staff to  the  organization.  This  approach  has  also \nworked very effectively for most global and domestic Asia-based credit rating agencies (CRAs). \n \n5. \nManagement. MCRIL is professionally managed, with a strong team of experienced and \nwell-qualified  staff  in  the  areas  of  business  development,  rating  services,  financial  analysis, \nbusiness  and  organizational  process  analysis,  operations,  and  research  and  publications.  A \nsummary profile of MCRIL\u2019s senior management is given below. MCRIL understands the need \nto comprehensively strengthen the management team, streamline its internal processes further, \nand bring in greater specialization and decentralization to its operations as a critical part of their \npost-ADB investment activities. ADB draws comfort from the management\u2019s and the founders\u2019 \nreceptivity  to  these  needs,  and  the  willingness  to  structure  this  formally  in  the  proposed \nbusiness and investment plan. \n \n6. \nSwetan  Sagar,  chief  operating  officer.  Swetan  Sagar  graduated  as  a  master  of \nbusiness administration (MBA) from the Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal. He has \nmore  than  15  years  of  professional  experience  across  nine  countries  in  South  Asia  and \nSoutheast Asia. He leads the research initiatives at MCRIL and EDA. His key areas of expertise \ninclude  designing  large-scale  research  projects;  conducting  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nprograms;  promoting  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs);  and  developing \nBDS markets. He also has significant experience in capacity and risk assessment of MFIs. \n \n7. \nGunjan  Grover,  senior  vice  president.  Gunjan  Grover  holds  an  MBA  in  rural \nmanagement from  the  Institute  of  Rural  Management,  Anand  (IRMA),  India  (gold  medallist); a \ncompany secretary degree (ACS) from the Institute of Company Secretaries of India, New Delhi; \nand  is  a  CFA  charter  holder.  He  has  more  than  10  years  of  experience  and  has  worked  in \n14 countries  across  Southeast  Asia,  South  Asia,  Commonwealth  of  Indipendent  States,  and \nAfrica  in  credit  ratings,  capacity  and  risk  assessments,  systems\u2019  evaluation,  and  loan  portfolio \nassessments of MFIs. \n \n8. \nBoard  profile.  Despite  its  shareholding  profile  and  accumulation  of  ownership  by  the \nfounders, MCRIL follows high standards of transparency and governance, and has established \n\n\fa board of directors with strong backgrounds and experiences in finance sector regulation, MFI \noperations, rural and commercial banking, and academia, to oversee its operations. Five of the \nseven  board  members  are  independent;  the  chairman  is  a  globally  renowned  expert  in \nmicrofinance  and  social  development.  These  are  strong  indicators  of  the  governance  and \ntransparency standards that form the backbone of MCRIL\u2019s operations. MCRIL\u2019s expertise and \nauthority give it a competitive edge over other its peers. \n \n9. \nThe board oversees the company\u2019s operations; helps assess and direct its key business; \nguides  decisions  on  human  resources,  investments,  and  expansion;  and  provides  an \noverarching  and  independent  oversight  of  the  analytical  rigor  and  consistency  of  MCRIL\u2019s \nproducts and services. \n \nBoth  founders  are  members  of  the  board,  with  equal  voting  rights  to  the  independent \n10. \nmembers, but do not have a formal veto, control or blocking right on any matter,3 which ensures \ncollective decision-making and alignment of interests between the founders, the management, \nand the board. The members of the board are profiled below: \n \n11.  Malcolm  Harper,  chairman.  A  professor  emeritus  of  the  Cranfield  School  of \nManagement in the United Kingdom, Harper is an internationally renowned expert in the field of \ndevelopment  theory,  microenterprise  promotion  and  microfinance,  financial  inclusion,  and \nlivelihoods of low-income families. His research and consultancy work has been supported by a \nwide  range  of  national, \ninternational,  and  nongovernment  development  agencies.  His \nexperience and knowledge in these fields stretches across Asia and Africa. \n \nYogesh Chand Nanda. An alumnus of Delhi School of Economics, he began his  career \n12. \nwith  the  State  Bank  of  India  and  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI).  He  later  joined  India\u2019s \nNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and eventually was appointed \nmanaging  director  and  chairman  of  NABARD.  He  is  also  a  former  chairman  of  Agriculture \nFinance Corporation. After his retirement, he was appointed a full-time member of the National \nCommission  of  Farmers  by  the  Government  of  India.    During  integrity  due  diligence  in \npreparation  of  the  proposed  project,  Nanda  was  identified  as  politically  exposed  person  in \nMCRIL\u2019s  structure.  However,  Nada  is  a  career  bureaucrat  and  has  been  selected  to  these \npositions  by  independent  selection  panels  that  do  not  have  political  affiliations.  Further,  his \ninvolvement with MCRIL came only after his retirement from all these institutions and as one of \nthe  five  independent  board  members;  he  has  no  power  to  influence  the  operations  or  key \ndecisions of the company. \n \nBrij Mohan. Brij Mohan started his career in the Indian Statistical Service and the Department \nof Company Affairs of the Government of India before joining the Industrial Development Bank \nof  India  in  1986.  In  1990,  he  opted  to  join  the  Small  Industries  Development  Bank  of  India \n(SIDBI) upon its formation. As a senior member of SIDBI\u2019s management he played a pivotal role \nin SIDBI\u2019s extensive engagement with the microfinance sector in India.  \n \n \nExecutive Director, Indian Institute of Banking and Finance \n \n                                                 \n3  \n\nIn the event of a dispute or unresolved matter at board level, the shareholders (i.e., the founders) can exercise \ntheir rights and proceed with their preferred decisions, but this, as stated by the founders, has never occurred in \nthe  company\u2019s  history.  The  ADB  investment  documentation  will  revise  the  board  and  shareholder  consent \narrangements to ensure that ADB has the benefit of minority protection provisions consistent with those usually \nobtained for similar investments. \n\n\fHK  Pradhan.  Pradhan  is  professor  of  finance  and  economics  at  XLRI  Jamshedpur, \n13. \nwhere  he  also  serves  as  the  member  of  the  Board  of  Governors  and  chairs  the  Doctoral \nProgramme.  He  is  at  present  a  member  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India\u2019s  Technical  Advisory \nCommittee on Money, Foreign Exchange, and Government Securities Markets; an independent \ndirector of the SBI Mutual Fund; and a member of the Index & Option Committee of the National \nCommodity  and  Derivative  Exchange,  Mumbai. He  has  worked  as the  Pacific  regional  advisor \nfor  the  Commonwealth  Secretariat,  London,  while  serving  concurrently  as  the  resident  debt \nadvisor with the Ministry of Finance, Government of Fiji Islands, during 2005\u20132007.  \n  \n14. \nFrances  Sinha,  managing  director,  EDA.  A  graduate  of  Oxford  University  and  the \nLondon  School  of  Economics,  Frances  Sinha  has  led  EDA  for  the  past  30  years  (she  is  a \ncofounder  and  board  member  of  EDA).  She  contributed  to  the  development  of  MCRIL  as  an \nassociate  company  of  EDA  and  led  the  teams  for  impact  assessment,  social  performance \nmanagement,  and  market  research  with  a focus  on  cost-effectiveness, gender  issues,  poverty \nanalysis,  and  practical  reporting  throughout  India  and  in  various  countries  of  Asia  and  Africa. \nFor  MCRIL,  she  pioneered  the  development  of  a  social  rating  methodology  to  complement \ncredit ratings.  \n \n15. \nSanjay  Sinha,  managing  director,  MCRIL.  An  alumnus  of  Oxford  University,  Sanjay \nSinha earned his master of philosophy degree in economics from Jesus College. He has over \n35  years  of  experience  in  the  areas  of  microfinance,  financial  inclusion,  and  rural  livelihoods.   \nHe pioneered the financial rating tool, making MCRIL one of the first organizations worldwide to \ninitiate  the  rating  of  MFIs.  He  has  provided  consultancy  and  advisory  services  to  numerous \nagencies  such  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  BRAC  Bank,  DFID,  CGAP,  Ford  Foundation, \nWorld Bank, among others. He is an internationally acclaimed authority on inclusive finance; in \nrecognition  of his  contribution  he  served  as  a  Member  of the  UN  Advisors Group  on  Inclusive \nFinancial Sectors during the Advisor Group\u2019s tenure, 2006\u20132008. \n \nB. \n \n16.  MCRIL  is  arguably  the  most  reputed  and  established  regional  agency  specialized  in \nadvisory  and  rating  services.  It  offers  a  well-diversified  range  of  products  and  services  to  its \nclients  while  simultaneously  maintaining  its  focus  on  its  core  competencies\u2014MFI  risk \nassessments,  governance  and  transparency,  operations  and  portfolio  quality  analyses,  social \nperformance  assessments  and  ratings,  sector  and  policy  reviews  centered  on  financial \ninclusion,  and  MFI-related  regulations  and  policy  reforms.  After  the  integration  of  EDA  into \nMCRIL, the business, product, and client portfolio of the combined entity will benefit from both \nrevenue and geographic diversification while still retaining overall focus and specialization.  \n \n17. \nOperations. MCRIL follows a well-established protocol in the conduct of its ratings and \nassessments. The rating process starts with a desk analysis of information and subsequent field \nvisits to the head office, operational branches, and the borrowers of the MFI. Unlike mainstream \nrating  agencies,  intensive  field  visits  and  interaction  with  clients  are  at  the  core  of  the  MCRIL \napproach. Its rating team prepares a detailed assessment report, cross-checks the data with the \nspecific  MFI  (without  discussing  or  disclosing  the  rating),  and  subsequently  ensures  adequate \nquality review by its senior management. As MCRIL has performed reviews, assessments, and \ndiagnostics  of  MFIs  within  the  same  geographic  region,  it  is  well  placed  for  a  comparative \nanalysis and benchmarking performance. \n \n18. \nThe  final  report,  along  with  additional  factual  details  and  data  provided  by  the  rated \ninstitution, is placed before the rating committee for a decision. Uniquely among all specialized \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n\fadvisory  and  rating  service  companies,  MCRIL\u2019s  rating  committee  consists  entirely  of \nmicrofinance experts who are independent of MCRIL\u2019s management and its founders. It is made \nup  of  senior  bankers,  commercial  lenders,  regulators,  and  chartered  accountants,  each  with \nindependent sources of income and none significantly dependent on earnings from MCRIL. The \nfounders participate in but are not voting members of the committee. Each report is referred to a \nsubcommittee consisting of two members of the rating committee; recusal is applied whenever a \nmember of the rating committee has any existing business relationship with the MFI to be rated. \nIt  is  only  after  discussion  with  the  rating  team  (and,  if  necessary,  after  seeking  further \nclarification  from  the  MFI)  that  the  committee  decides  the  final  rating  for  the  MFI.  These \npractices  are  born  out  of  the  significance  attached  by  MCRIL  to  analytical  rigor,  objectivity, \nindependence of judgment, transparency, and avoidance of conflicts of interest. MCRIL also has \nadequate procedures to handle conflict-of-interest situations with those MFIs that are its clients \nfor  risk  advisory,  risk-assessment,  and  process-review  engagements.  These  make  up  a \nsignificant proportion of its client base, but MCRIL observes a cooling period of 3 years before \nsuch  entities  are  considered  as  clients  for  ratings.  This  arrangement  also  works  well  from  a \nbusiness perspective because most MFI prefer an initial diagnostic input, followed by a plan to \nimprove  their  governance  and  disclosure  and  operating  procedures,  which  enhances  their \nprospects for a better risk assessment or rating.  \n \n19. \nFuture  strategy.  MCRIL  intends  to  follow  a  medium-term  three-pronged  strategy  to \ncapitalize  on  emerging  opportunities  and  realize  the  proposed  investment  objectives.  This  will \ninvolve (i) consolidating the activities of EDA and MCRIL into a single entity, as a precondition of \n(ii) strengthening the organization\u2019s staff, resources, and internal processes to expand outreach \nand  market  share  in  India  once  MCRIL  is  accredited  as  a  CRA  by  RBI;  and  (iii)  utilizing  its \ncurrent experience, skills, competence, and client relations to widen its geographic coverage by \nestablishing  more  permanent  operations  in  the  identified  key  markets.  MCRIL  has  already \nshown its commitment to the regional expansion strategy by setting up a subsidiary in Myanmar \nand looking at a possible joint venture in the PRC.  \n \n20. \nThe overall strategic plan\u2014which was discussed extensively with ADB and aligned with \ncommon  objectives\u2014benefits  from  a  phased  investment  approach  and  an  ability  to  track \nprogress, outcomes, and capital requirements against a plan and to time ADB\u2019s proposed equity \ninfusion  accordingly.  The  approach  also  helps  diversify  risks  since  MCRIL  is  well  placed  to \ncapitalize on the market opportunities after being accredited by the RBI, when the incremental \ncash flows and earnings from its India operations can help partly bear the initial investments and \nthe start-up expenses of the overseas operations, as well as deliver interim financial returns to \nshareholders. MCRIL will also deploy its existing cash flows and cash reserves to part-fund the \nproposed strategy. \n\n \n\nThe  existing  MFI  borrowing  base  in  India  (globally  the  largest  microfinance  market) \n21. \noffers  MCRIL  an  opportunity  to  scale  up  its  business,  which  will  yield  more  predictable  cash \nflows for supporting the early market expansion into key countries such as Cambodia, the PRC, \nIndonesia,  and  Nepal,  where  microfinance  penetration  is  expected  to  increase  with  greater \naccess to long-term funding. India leads the Asian market in terms of active MFI borrowers with \n49  million;  Bangladesh,  19  million;  Viet  Nam,  8  million;  Philippines,  5  million;  Pakistan,  3.7 \nmillion; China, 2.7 million; Cambodia, 2.3 million; Indonesia, 1.3 million; Nepal, 1.2 million; and \nSri Lanka, 0.6 million.4  \n                                                 \n4 Source: Microfinance Information Exchange Market (MIX Market), gathered on 4 April 2016  \n\n \n\n\fDETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n\n \n1. \nGiven the strong track record of Micro-Credit Ratings International Limited (MCRIL) with \nregard to its operations, rigor in internal procedures, good governance and disclosure practices, \nand the oversight by an independent board, the project team is of the opinion that the operating \narrangements  for  this  investment,  in  its  post-approval  (holding  period)  stage,  will  not  require \nsubstantial amendments and changes to MCRIL\u2019s current practices. The business plan for the \nproposed  investment  captures  the  next  steps  in  (i)  seeking  regulatory  approvals  for \naccreditation  in  India,  (ii)  pursuing regional  expansion  in  the  pre-specified  markets  by  opening \nregional or in-country offices, and (c) strengthening the organizational resources and skills base \nby hiring new staff, providing training, and upgrading the information technology.   \n \n2. \n\nThe milestones to be tracked in the post-approval stage involve \n(i)  compliance with all terms and the specific conditions precedent; \n(ii)  the  progress  of  approvals  from  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI) \nand  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  for  MCRIL\u2019s  accreditation  as  a  credit  rating \nagency (CRA). \n\n(iii) the company\u2019s regional expansion activities, capital spending, and staff hiring plan. \n \n3. \nBecause some of the milestones require a longer execution period and are sensitive to \nchanging business conditions and market opportunities, the availability period for ADB\u2019s equity \ninvestment was kept at 3 years from the date of first disbursement. Some milestones relating to \nthe  hiring  of  new  staff,  staff  training,  realignment  of  the  organizational  structure,  and \nestablishment of overseas offices cannot be pegged to rigid timelines. An extended availability \nperiod  will  give  MCRIL  an  opportunity  to  pace  its  activities  and  progress  around  specific \nopportunities, and will also allow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to review progress and to \ntime the disbursement of the second tranche accordingly.   \n \nMerger.  The  merger  of  MCRIL  with  its  parent  company,  EDA  Rural  Systems  Private  Limited \n(EDA), is a condition precedent to ADB\u2019s investment. Given the merits of this restructuring, the \nsponsors had already planned the merger, and the inclusion of ADB as an institutional investor \naccelerated its execution. \n \n4. \nThe  merger  is  at  an  advance  stage  and  awaiting  the  issuance  of  the  final  approval \ndocuments  by  the  courts  in  India.  Since  MCRIL  and  EDA  have  functioned  collectively  as  one \norganization,  often  servicing  a  common  set  of  clients  and  frequently  rotating  or  interchanging \ntheir  staff,  the  operational  issues  in  managing this  merger  are minimal. The  expected  benefits \nrelate  to greater client focus  and  synergies  in  the  new  markets;  streamlining  of  some  costs of \nsupport functions (e.g., audit, finance, information technology); reduction in statutory obligations \n(audits, separate board meetings); and overall efficiency gains for the merged entity (MCRIL).   \n\n \n\n5. \nAccreditation.  ADB  will  invest  its  first  tranche  of  investment  in  the  merged  entity  to \nallow MCRIL to be considered eligible for CRA accreditation by RBI and SEBI. ADB will qualify \nas an eligible promoter-investor for these purposes, and additionally MCRIL will meet minimum \nnet  worth  requirements  (applicable  SEBI  regulations  require  that  a  CRA  have  a  minimum  net \nworth  of  Rs50  million,  and  have  a  promoter-shareholder  holding  at  least  10%  of  it).  It  is \nexpected that it will take at least 8\u201310 months between ADB\u2019s first-tranche investment and the \n\n\fcompletion  of  the  SEBI  and  RBI  approval  process,  i.e.,  the  accreditation  of  MCRIL.1  The \ninvestment of the second tranche is expected to be made after the accreditation process, within \nthe limits of 25% of the merged company\u2019s total equity, or a $1.5 million investment limit. The \ninvestment  outlays  in  the  interim  would  be  partly  deployed  toward  funding  the  India-focused \noperations. \n\n \n6. \nOverseas  expansion  and  staff  hiring.  MCRIL  will  be  utilizing  a  substantial  part  of \nADB\u2019s proceeds for its overseas expansion, largely to fund initial set-up expenses, payments for \noffice premises and physical infrastructure, and for hiring on-site staff. These expenses will be \noutlined in MCRIL\u2019s annual budget plans and part-funded by ADB\u2019s equity infusion. \n \n7. \nOperating  arrangements  relating  to  staffing  will  include  hiring  for  the  new  positions; \nwidening  the  analytical  staff  pool  and  increasing  specialization  in  new  markets  and  products; \nand  centralizing  certain  administrative  and  support  functions  around  new  staff  roles  (such  as \ncompany secretary and chief financial officer). It is anticipated that ADB\u2019s equity investment will \nfurther elevate  MCRIL\u2019s  stature as an employer, and  will help attract a wider and better talent \npool.2 This will also be reinforced by the employee share option plan arrangements, which ADB \nhas structured into the terms of investment. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The process laid out by SEBI is transparent and the guidelines and requirements are well defined. MCRIL, which \nhas  been  in  the  business  of  microfinance  institution  (MFI)  ratings  for  several  years,  has  already  adapted  and \npracticed the internal processes and control arrangements that are recommended for CRAs.  \n\n2 MCRIL still is seen in high regard amongst fresh graduates from specialized premiere schools like the Institute of \nRural Management at Anand, where MCRIL is a preferred employer; largely drawn in by the profile and reputation \nof the Sponsors. \n\n\fCONTRIBUTION TO THE ADB RESULTS FRAMEWORK \n\nNo.  Results Framework Indicators  \n\nTargets \n\n(Level 2) \n\n1  Microfinance loan accounts opened  \n\nor end borrowers reached  \n\nMethods or \nComments \n\nTotal number of microfinance \nborrowers increased by 1.5 million \nby 2022 \n \nTotal number of female \nmicrofinance borrowers increased \nby 1.35 million by 2022 \n\n \n \n \n \n90 percent of total \nmicrofinance \nborrowers are women \n\nSource: Asian Development Ban \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n1.  \nBackground. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) proposes to invest the lesser of the \nIndian  rupee  equivalent  of  $1.5  million  or  25%  of the  net  worth  in  the  merged  entity  of  Micro-\nCredit  Ratings  International  Limited  (MCRIL)  and  EDA  Rural  Systems  Private  Limited  (EDA); \nMCRIL  will  be  the  post-merger  entity.  The  proposed  pre-money  valuation  of  the  investment  is \nbased on the reported book value of the merged entity, to be calculated with the latest available \naudited results, prior to the investment. The following factors are considered in ADB\u2019s proposed \nvaluation:  \n(i) \n\nThe book-value approach is considered more appropriate for this investment, given \n(a)  MCRIL\u2019s  simple  business  model  and  cash-flow  pattern;  (b)  its  consistently \nconservative  accounting  policies;  (c)  the  absence  of  any  third-party  or  external \nliabilities; (d) its asset base consisting almost entirely of the company\u2019s own office \npremises (fixed assets), and cash and good-quality receivables as current assets; \nand  (e)  assets \nthe  sponsors  contribution  (initial \nthrough \ncapitalization)  and  accrued  profits  or  retained  earnings  of  the  company  over  the \npast  20  years.  In  summation,  given  the  absence  of  any  financing  complexity  and \nthe  company\u2019s  conservative  accounting,  the  reported  book  value  is  a  very  good \nindicator of the fair value of MCRIL. \n\nfunded  entirely \n\n(ii)  ADB\u2019s  valuation proposal factors in (a) the strong reputation of the Sponsors and \nthe  highly  regarded  stature  of  MCRIL  globally\u2014as  a  specialized  advisory,  rating, \ntraining,  and  research-focused  entity\u2014built  over  20  years  of  operations; \n(b) MCRIL\u2019s  track  record  in  India,  and  its  focus  and  alignment  with  ADB\u2019s  DMC \nmarkets;  (c)  minimal  start-up  risk  for  ADB,  since  MCRIL  has  staff  resources  and \nproven  management  competence  to  expand  its  client  and  product  coverage  to \nthese  markets;  (d)  a  well-established  trend  of  operating  profitability  (since \ninception) and reinvestment of all its earnings in its core business; (e) willingness \nto  work  with  ADB,  demonstrated  by  the  sponsors  agreement  to  some  onerous \nconditions  specified  by  ADB;  and  (f)  the  expected  rate  of  return  from  the \ninvestment,  even  after  assuming  moderate  growth  and  a  tempered  impact  of \nADB\u2019s  investment,  and  the  reasonably  visible  prospects  of  both  annual  dividends \nand capital gains from an exit. \n\n(iii)  The investment plan structured by ADB is substantially de-risked, since the equity \ninfusion  will  be  in  at  least  two  tranches,  with  high  visibility  of  the  improving \nbusiness and earnings prospects of the investee. The valuation factors in the exit \narrangements structured by ADB, which allow for a clear path to divestment within \na  reasonable  holding  period,  if  other  options  like  a  third-party  trade  sale  do  not \nmaterialize.  \n\n(iv)  The  proposed  valuation  is  in  the  lower  range  of  the  fair  value  estimated  in  the \n\nindependent valuation exercise.  \n\n(v)  This exercise should also be viewed in the context of materiality, e.g., in view of the \ninvestment size ($1.5 million equivalent) as well as the business-plan and funding \nrequirements  of  the  company.  Any  excessive  reengineering  of  assumptions, \nvaluation approaches, and multiples will not translate into any meaningful reduction \nin  ADB\u2019s  exposure.  On  the  other  hand,  it  may  leave  MCRIL  in  the  suboptimal \nsituation of a partially funded business plan.  \n\n \n2. \nWith  ADB  having  a  25%  stake,  estimated  to  be  acquired  by  fiscal  year  (FY)  2018,  the \nsponsors\u2019 holdings will be reduced to 60%. The employees\u2019 stock options, a critical element of \nADB\u2019s  investment  terms,  will  increase  to  nearly  15%  within  2  years  of  ADB\u2019s  entry  as  an \ninvestor.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth Strategy, and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\n \nSupporting  finance  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of  development  assistance  for  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB), in line with the tenets detailed in ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy and in its enhanced \npoverty  reduction  strategy.a  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy  refers  specifically  to  ADB\u2019s  role  in \nstrengthening the finance sectors in its developing member countries (DMCs). The investment also aligns with \nthe  country  partnership  strategies  for  India,  where  Micro-Credit  Ratings  International  Limited  (MCRIL)  will \npotentially  expand  its  operations,  and  for  other  regional  DMCs  (Cambodia,  People's  Republic  of  China, \nIndonesia, Myanmar, and Nepal) that are targeted in MCRIL\u2019s phased expansion approach. Improving access \nto  finance,  especially  for low-income  borrowers  in rural  and  semiurban  areas,  facilitated  through  microfinance \ninstitutions  (MFIs),  is  an  integral  part  of  the  national  poverty  reduction  and  growth  strategies  in  the  regional \nDMCs where MCRIL plans to expand its operations.  \n\n \n \nB. Results from the Poverty and Social Analysis during Project Preparation or Due Diligence  \n \n\n1.  Key poverty and social issues. The microfinance sector targets borrowers at the bottom of the pyramid \nwho  often  rely  on  informal  channels  (friends,  family,  and  informal  moneylenders)  for  credit.  Access  to \nfinance, and assistance in mitigating the adversities from the unreliability of their incomes, is a key issue for \nlower-income  households.  As  private  and  state-owned  banks  are  unable  or  ill-positioned  to  deliver  credit \nand  financial  services  to  the  smallest  and  remotest  segments  of  low-income  populations  (those  deemed \nleast creditworthy), direct access to credit is a major challenge. MFIs generally lack established procedures \nfor  consumer  protection,  transparency,  and  fairness,  which  has  resulted  in  some  of  them  exploiting  the \nvulnerability  of  borrowers.  The  financing  constraints  are  more  severe  in  less-developed  countries,  where \nfinancial  markets  are  not  well  developed,  regulatory  and  legal  frameworks  are  weak,  informational \nasymmetries are persistent, and risk management systems are not as robust. A developed finance sector \nhelps mobilize and allocate resources, and manage risks, contributing to private sector development. \n\n2.  Beneficiaries.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  MCRIL  will  strengthen  the  institutional  capacities  of  the  microfinance \nsector  and  will  improve  access  to  microfinance  in  ADB  DMCs.  It  will  allow  MCRIL  to  widen  its  market \ncoverage  for  risk  advisory,  assessment,  and  rating  services  to  MFIs,  create  opportunities  for  MFIs  to \nservice a much wider client base, and provide commercial and institutional lenders with a more transparent \nand consistent basis for MFI evaluation. \n\nImpact  channels.  A  wider  application  of  services  by  MCRIL  and  associated  improvements  made  by  the \nMFIs  will  lead  to  sustained  access  to  funding  from  financiers,  resulting  in  an  expansion  of  the  coverage \nareas and client base of these entities.  \n\n \n4.  Other social and poverty issues. \u2013 None. \n\n \n3. \n\n \n\n5.  Design  features.  The  investment  will  impact  MFI  activities  nationally  and  regionally  through  (i)  better \naccess to MFI advisory, assessment, and rating services in ADB DMCs, which will help MFIs access long-\nterm funds from institutional and commercial lenders; (ii) greater ability for responsible MFIs to expand their \ncoverage and loan portfolio; and (iii) greater access to finance for low-income borrowers.  \n\n \nC.

Any gaps with the standard social practices will have to be bridged by the MFIs, \nand will be monitored.  \n2.

Key issues.  \nOpportunities  for  business  expansion,  employment  growth,  and  innovation  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (MSMEs)  are  severely  limited  because  of  substantial  unmet  financing  needs  in  most  DMCs,  including \nthose  where  MCRIL  proposes  to  expand:  Azerbaijan,  Cambodia,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Indonesia,  Myanmar, \nand  Nepal.  Across  these  developing  countries,  women  entrepreneurs  have  less  access  to  finance  than  male \nentrepreneurs.b  This  not  only  impedes  women\u2019s  ability  to  grow  their  businesses,  it  can  also  restrict  the  types  of \nbusinesses they can start and thus their future potential. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that \nas many  as  70%  of  women-owned  small  enterprises in  the  formal sector  in  developing countries are not served or \nunderserved by financial institutions\u2014a financing gap of $260 to $320 billion.c  \n \nB. Key actions.  \n      \n   \nMCRIL  commits  to  implement  the  following  activities  to  promote  gender-inclusive  access  to  finance  to  low-income \nborrowers, as part of its expansion into new markets: (i) provide broader access to institutional credit for 60 MFIs that \naim to improve gender inclusion, based on ratings by MCRIL; (ii) support 75 MFIs in expanding their coverage and \nloan portfolio to improve access for women-owned MSMEs in rural and semiurban areas; (iii) provide better access to \nfinance  from  MFIs,  and  benefit  1.5  million  lower-  or  marginal-income  borrowers,  which  includes  200,000  first-time \nborrowers,  of  whom  at  least  90%  will  be  women;  (iv)  support  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of \n50 MFIs  on nonfinancial aspects,  targeting  fairness  and  protection of  interests  of  end-borrowers  (90% of  whom  are \nwomen), apart from training of 650 women staff in dealing with end-borrowers, mostly women MSMEs; and (v) carry \nout  research  and  evaluation  studies  that  contribute  to  sector  awareness  of  gender  issues  and  barriers  to  women\u2019s \naccess to finance. The gender action plan (Appendix 7) details the proposed activities.  \nIV.

(22 June 2016) \n\n\fSAFEGUARDS AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS SUMMARY \n\n \nA.  \n\nto  microfinance \n\nSafeguards \n \nThe  equity  investment  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  Micro-Credit  Ratings \n1. \nInternational  Limited  (MCRIL)  will  allow  the  company  to  widen  its  market  coverage  for  risk \nadvisory,  assessment,  and  rating  services \ninstitutions  (MFIs),  create \nopportunities  for  MFIs  to  service  a  much  wider  client  base,  and  provide  commercial  and \ninstitutional  lenders  with  a  more  transparent  and  consistent  basis  for  evaluating  MFIs.  This  in \nturn will improve overall access to finance in ADB developing member countries. The activities \nassociated with MCRIL\u2019s operations are expected to have negligible environmental impacts, and \nare unlikely to trigger impacts related to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The \ninvestment  is  categorized  as  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n   \nB. \n \n2. \nMCRIL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.1  MCRIL  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  its  compliance  with  such  laws  and  the \nmeasures taken. The investment in MCRIL is expected to result in greater access to finance for \nlow-income borrowers, 90% of which are typically women, in mostly rural and semiurban areas, \nand has been categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plan proposes \nthe implementation of the following actions to give women in rural and semiurban areas greater \naccess  to  credit:  (i)  expand  access  to  MCRIL\u2019s  advisory,  assessment,  and  rating  services  in \nnew  markets;  (ii)  Increase  and  improve  access  to  institutional  credit  for  MFIs,  so  they  can \nexpand their coverage and loan portfolio; (iii) provide broader access to finance for low-income \nborrowers;  (iv)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacities  of  MFIs,  consistent  with  industry  best \npractices; and (v) document and disseminate good practices from MCRIL operations. \n\nOther Social Dimensions \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.Social Protection Strategy.
