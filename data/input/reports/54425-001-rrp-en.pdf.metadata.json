The project will provide Bio Farma with financing for vaccine \nprocurement and logistics based on an agreed list of eligible expenditures to vaccinate priority \npopulations against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The rapid response component (RRC) \nunder the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) will be utilized. The project is aligned with \nthe following operational priorities of Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) fostering regional cooperation \nand  integration.1  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024, as it will improve the well-being of Indonesians by \nstrengthening the health system and preventing the spread of COVID-19.2     \n \n2. \n\nThe project fulfills all APVAX access criteria as shown in Table 1.   \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility  \n\nAccess Criteria \n1.

Established \neffective \ndevelopment \npartner \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nCOVID-19 has infected more than 1.3 million Indonesians, causing about 35,000 fatalities, \nincluding more than 840 fatalities of health care workers. Health services have suffered \nsevere disruption. Women have been exposed to greater risk than men because of their \nprofessional  affiliations  and  roles  within  households.  COVID-19  caused  real  gross \ndomestic product to contract by 2.1% in 2020, down from an original growth forecast of \n5.2%. Approximately 30 million people have experienced reductions in work hours or job \nloss, worsening the incidence of poverty.  \nThe  government  has  assessed  vaccine  needs  using  the  Vaccination  Introduction \nReadiness Assessment Tool developed by WHO and UNICEF, which has identified gaps \nin \nlogistics,  service  delivery,  pharmacovigilance,  and  vaccine  acceptance.  The \ngovernment has started to strengthen cold chain storage and distribution capacity, train \nvaccinators, develop guidelines for adverse effects following immunization, and scale up \nrisk communication and community engagement. \nPresidential  Regulation  No.  99/2020,  as  amended  by  Presidential  Regulation  No. \n14/2021,  provides  the  legal  basis  for  Indonesia\u2019s  Vaccination  Allocation  Plan,  which \ncomprises,  among  others,  access  prioritization  criteria,  a  procurement  plan,  and \nincluding  a  medical  waste  management  plan. \nimplementation  arrangements, \nRecommendations from the Indonesian Technical Advisory Group on Immunizations and \nthe WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization are incorporated into the \nVaccination Allocation Plan, which consists of government-funded and employer-funded \nprograms. Given the devastating impact of the pandemic on the health care system and \nthe economy, the government is seeking to vaccinate 181.5 million Indonesians, or 67% \nof the population. Vaccinations under the government-funded program are free of charge \nand mandatory. In parallel, the employer-funded program seeks to accelerate vaccination \ncoverage  by  allowing  businesses  to  pay  for  the  free  provision  of  vaccinations  to  their \nemployees and families.  \nStandard operating procedures for collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical \nwaste, overseen by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, \nhave been strengthened in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nADB  has  received  the  Governor\u2019s  letter  confirming  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimplement  its  VAP  and  comply  with  vaccine  eligibility  criteria  under  the  Asia  Pacific \nVaccine Access Facility. \nThe  Committee  for  Handling  COVID-19  and  National  Economic  Recovery,  through  its \nproject  management  office,  regularly  engages  with  development  partners  on  the \nVaccination  Allocation  Plan  and  the  needs  assessment.

COVID-19  continues  to  spread  widely  in  Indonesia,  with  more  than  1.3 \nmillion people infected and about 35,000 fatalities as of early March 2021.3 In February 2021, the \ndaily  positivity  rate  (the  percentage  of  individuals  who  tested  positive  out  of  the  total  number \ntested) stood at over 20% which is significantly higher than the 5% benchmark set by the World \nHealth Organization (WHO). Surveillance systems and volunteers have been deployed to carry \nout contact tracing, but a wide gap remains between the number of cases suspected and tested.4 \n \nImpact on the health system.5 COVID-19 has affected the delivery of health services in \n4. \nIndonesia  and  hampered  the  attainment  of  universal  health  coverage.  With  more  than  840 \nfatalities  among  health  care  workers,  COVID-19 has  hindered  the  delivery  of  health services,6 \nreducing working hours and service provision in around half of the country\u2019s 10,000 community \nhealth centers.7 Fear of contracting the virus is reported to have depressed public utilization of \nhealth  services  in  92%  of  community  health  centers.8  Disruption  to  routine  health  services, \nincluding immunization, could raise the incidence of communicable disease, which would further \nstrain a health system already struggling to cope with COVID-19.9  \n \n5. \nImpact  on  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  COVID-19  has  had  a  severe  impact  on \nIndonesia\u2019s economy, causing real gross domestic product to contract by 2.1% in 2020, the first \ncontraction in over 2 decades. The pandemic also reversed some hard-won development gains. \nApproximately  30  million  people  have  experienced  reduced  work  hours  or  job  loss,10  and  the \npoverty rate rose from 9.2% in September 2019 to 10.2% in September 2020.11 Regional inequity \nin  health  outcomes  has  been  exacerbated  (footnote  7),  partly  because  17%  of  the  population \nlacks national health insurance coverage, which impedes health care access.12 As older people \nare particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, people aged 60 and over account for more than 48% of \ndeaths related to COVID-19 in the country.13  \n \n\n2021). \n\n \n\n3    Government of Indonesia.

COVID-19 has put women\u2019s health at greater risk because of reduced \n6. \naccess  to  sexual  and  reproductive  health  services.  Moreover,  women  are  at  higher  risk  of \nexposure to COVID-19 than men as they comprise the majority of health and social workers (68%) \nand nurses and doctors (74%) and are more likely than men to be caregivers in the home.14 A \nrecent survey reported that about 65% of women have spent more time on unpaid domestic work \nsince the pandemic began than previously.15 An estimated 39% of female informal workers have \nlost  their  jobs,  with  only  20%  of  them  receiving  government  support.16 Further,  the  number  of \nreported cases of violence against women and girls has increased during the pandemic.17  \n \n7. \nGovernment coordination for COVID-19 vaccination. The government has established \na robust set of mechanisms to coordinate its response across different levels of government. The \nCommittee for Handling COVID-19 and National Economic Recovery, headed by the coordinating \nminister for economic affairs, oversees COVID-19 response, including the vaccination program. \nThe executive chair of the committee is the Minister of State-owned Enterprises, who has been \nclosely  coordinating  vaccine  procurement  efforts.18  Vaccination  implementation  teams\u2014\ncomprising  central,  provincial,  and  district  officials\u2014have  been  assigned  to  ensure  strong \ncoordination  of  vaccination  administration  activities.  Provincial  and  city  and/or  district \ngovernments will assume responsibility, through their health offices, for service delivery including \nvaccine administration, while local government units, especially in subdistricts and villages, will \nsupport registration and community engagement efforts. Presidential Regulation No. 99/2020, as \namended  by  Presidential  Regulation  No.  14/2021,  sets  out  implementation  arrangements  for \nvaccine procurement and distribution.19 It authorizes the Minister of Health to assign the 100% \nstate-owned  vaccine  manufacturer,  Bio  Farma,  and  its  subsidiaries,  PT  Indofarma  Tbk \n(Indofarma) and PT Kimia Farma Tbk (Kimia Farma), to procure vaccines.20  \n \n8. \nThe  Minister  of  Health  assigned  to  Bio  Farma  and  Indofarma  lead  roles  in  procuring \nCOVID-19 vaccines for three reasons. First, Bio Farma is the sole supplier of vaccines  for the \nNational Immunization Program, and has a track record of delivering vaccines expeditiously to \nsuppress  past  disease  outbreaks.21  With  annual  production capacity  of  approximately  2  billion \ndoses and 12  WHO-prequalified  vaccines,  Bio Farma has  played  an  integral  role  in bolstering \nnational, regional, and global health security. Second, since its establishment in 1890, Bio Farma \nhas  acquired  deep  expertise  and  a  broad  network  in  the  global  vaccine  industry,  which  has \npositioned  it  well  to  source  COVID-19  vaccines  quickly  and  negotiate  cost-effective  purchase \n\n \n\n14   Australia  Indonesia  Partnership  for  Economic  Development.  2020.

These  plans  are  supported  by  various  decrees23  and  guidelines,24  incorporating \nrecommendations from the Indonesian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization.25 The VAP \nconsists of government- and employer-funded programs. To attain herd immunity as quickly as \npossible  to  aid  economic  recovery,  the  government  seeks  to  vaccinate,  free  of  charge,  181.5 \nmillion Indonesians, or 67% of the population.26 Eligible target groups and their order of priority \nare summarized in Table 2. The order of priority is consistent with the recommendations of the \nWHO  Strategic  Advisory  Group  of  Experts  on  Immunization,  as  it  first  protects  health  care \nworkers, public officers, older people, and people at high risk of infection.27 Vaccination began on \n13 January 2021.

Exemptions and postponements are permitted for medical \nreasons.29  Service  providers  carry  out  pre-vaccination  screening,  with  additional  screening  for \nthose  over  60  years  old,  to  determine  whether  exemptions  or  postponements  apply.30  Under \nPresidential  Regulation  14/2021,  failure  by  eligible  recipients  to  participate  in  the  vaccination \nprogram  may  result  in  imposition  of  administrative  sanctions  by  ministries,  agencies  and \nsubnational  governments  in  accordance  with  their  respective  authorities.31  Further,  eligible \nrecipients who do not participate in vaccination and also obstruct the implementation efforts to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19 may incur sanctions pursuant to Law No. 4 of 1984 on Infectious \nDisease  Outbreaks.32  The  government  expects  that  vaccination,  together  with  comprehensive \nsocial  assistance  programs,  can  shield  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  negative  impacts  arising \nfrom COVID-19.33 Presidential Regulation 14/2021 also provides for the cost of medical care and \ncompensation in case of any adverse events following immunization (AEFI) to encourage vaccine \nuptake.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  some  evidence  that  government  advocacy  efforts  are \ncontributing to one of the highest vaccine acceptance rates in the world,34 with one Indonesia-\nspecific  survey  showing  an  acceptance  rate  of  80%.35  There  is  clear  recognition  within  the \ngovernment  that  awareness  building  campaigns  and  advocacy  will  drive  the  success  of  the \nvaccination program with sanctions being a last resort. In the rollout of the vaccination program, \nthe government\u2019s first and foremost focus is to achieve early success and provide a high degree \nof assurance to the people that collective action is critical to ensure positive health outcomes and \nrestoration of livelihoods.  \n \n11. \nEmployer-funded vaccination program. This program seeks to accelerate vaccination \ncoverage  by  allowing  businesses  to  purchase  COVID-19  vaccines  from  Bio  Farma  or  other \nentities  authorized  by  the  Minister  of  Health  to  vaccinate  employees  and  their  families  free  of \ncharge. Bio Farma and Kimia Farma will procure vaccines for the employer-funded program. To \nringfence human resources and logistics capacity for the government-funded program, vaccines \nprocured  through  the  employer-funded  program  must  differ  from  those  procured  for  the \ngovernment-funded program, and health facilities that administer vaccinations under this program \nmust similarly differ from those under the government-funded program. The central government \nwill regulate and oversee the implementation of vaccination under the employer-funded program \nby  establishing  (i)  minimum  standards  for  health  facilities  providing  vaccination  services,  (ii)  a \nprice ceiling for the vaccination that covers vaccines and associated services, and (iii) reporting \nrequirements.

Medical waste management plan.37 The government anticipates an increase in medical \nwaste such as syringes, vials, and personal protective equipment from vaccinators because of \nCOVID-19  vaccinations.  Prior  to  COVID-19,  standard  operating  procedures  were  in  place  for \ncollection, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical waste, overseen by the MOH and Ministry \nof Environment and Forestry. These procedures were strengthened in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic  (para.  36).  Currently,  20  of  34  provinces  have  at  least  one  licensed  medical  waste \ntreatment  facility,  and  provinces  lacking  one  send  their  waste  to  neighboring  provinces  for \ntreatment and disposal. To enhance waste management capacity, the government is installing \n\n36   At present, these vaccines are those manufactured by AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech, \n\nSinovac Life Sciences, Sinopharm, and Bio Farma. \n\n37   Due Diligence of Indonesia\u2019s Medical Waste Management System (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\n \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nadditional centralized waste treatment facilities and procuring more equipment for sterilization and \ndisposal, including autoclaves and incinerators.  \n \n14.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). To ensure the successful implementation of the VAP, \nthe government is putting in place the One Data system, an integrated data management system \nfor M&E. The One Data system tracks the vaccination process at each stage (pre-, during, and \npost-immunization) under the supervision of relevant agencies and ministries. The government \nwill collate data on eligibility and basic personal details, monitor and record coverage (including \nfollow-up for second doses) and certification, monitor service quality and pharmacovigilance, and \nreconcile demand and supply logistics data. To improve accountability, reports for M&E purposes \nproduced from the One Data system will be made publicly available.   \n \nNeeds  assessment.38  Using  the  Vaccination  Introduction  Readiness  Assessment  Tool \n15. \n(VIRAT) developed by WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), MOH regularly \nassesses readiness for COVID-19 vaccination introduction and administration with support from \ndevelopment  partners  and  the  Indonesian  Technical  Advisory  Group  on  Immunization.39 \nIndonesia has made good progress so far, but challenges remain. In the area of logistics, a recent \nUNICEF assessment of 9,750 health facilities showed that 27 of 34 provinces need to upgrade \ntheir cold chain equipment, and 447 of 514 districts lack adequate equipment to accommodate \nthe expected volume of COVID-19 vaccines. At minimum, 110 walk-in cold rooms and 5,400 ice-\nlined refrigerators are required.40 To address these gaps, discussions are under way with MOH \nfor  Bio  Farma  to  enter  contractual  arrangements  with  private  logistics  companies  to  provide \nadditional cold-chain storage and distribution capabilities, while the government will procure and \nupgrade or repair equipment for health facilities. Bio Farma\u2019s logistics management information \nsystem monitors the location of vaccines and temperature conditions.  As of early March 2021, \nmore than 13,000 service points that fulfill minimum standards for vaccination had been identified, \nand at least 30,000 vaccinators had been trained. Simulation exercises to check the service flow \nand  procedures  have taken  place  at  four  health  centers.  Further  training  for  health  workers  is \nexpected, and incentives for vaccinators are being planned. Regarding pharmacovigilance, the \nIndonesian  Food  and  Drug  Supervisory  Authority  will  issue  approvals  for  all  vaccines  prior  to \nadministration.  Guidance  for  AEFIs  has  been  developed,  and  national  and  provincial  AEFI \ncommittees  have  been  established.  While  a  recent  survey  shows  vaccine  acceptance  to  be \naround  80%,41  in  the  past  Indonesia  has  experienced  challenges  relating  to  hesitancy.42  To \naddress  vaccine  hesitancy,  development  partners  have  supported  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of communications and advocacy strategies, and the government has undertaken \ncommunication campaigns to build public confidence and address misinformation. MOH oversees \nthe implementation of VIRAT activities, with support from ministries, agencies, and development \npartners including ADB. \n \n16. \nFinancing needs. To finance vaccine procurement and rollout, the government has so \nfar  allocated  $3.98  billion  in  budgetary  resources.43  Bio  Farma  and Indofarma  have the  public \nmandate for procuring COVID-19 vaccine doses (Table 3) under the government-funded program \namounting to more than $1.5 billion in 2021\u20132022. Bio Farma and Indofarma require immediate \nfinancing  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  to  meet  payment  obligations  under  existing  vaccine  purchase \n\n \n\n38   Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39   The needs assessment is informed by the VIRAT. \n40   UNICEF. 2021.

ADB \nleads  meetings  of  key  partners  providing  vaccine-related  support  to  Indonesia,  including \nAustralia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, the United \nStates Agency for International Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control \nand  Prevention.  Immediate  financing  support  is  expected  from  (i)  the  World  Bank,  which  is \nplanning to provide additional financing of $500 million to the government for vaccine deployment \nand  COVID-19  public  health  response  more  generally,  including  scaled  up  testing  and  health \nworker capacity building, with approval expected in May 2021; and (ii) the Islamic Development \nBank through the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation, which is planning to provide a \nworking capital facility of $100 million to Bio Farma, to be guaranteed by the sovereign.   \n  \nB. \n \n18. \nImpact and outcome. The government, through the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises \nand  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  Bio  Farma  have  requested  ADB  support  for  COVID-19  vaccine \nprocurement  and  logistics  under  APVAX  to  help address  Indonesia\u2019s  urgent  public  health  and \neconomic challenges associated with COVID-19. The project is aligned with the following impacts: \ntransmission of COVID-19 reduced, public health improved, and economic productivity restored \n(footnote  23);  and  SARS-CoV2\u2019s  spread,  morbidity,  and  mortality  reduced;  and  confidence  of \ncitizens restored.45 The project will have the following outcome: priority populations vaccinated \nagainst COVID-19, with the target of vaccinating at least 27 million people assuming a minimum \nwastage rate of 15%.46  \n \n19. \nOutput:  COVID-19  vaccines  procured  and  deployed  to  provinces.  The  project  will \nprovide financing for vaccine procurement by Bio Farma and/or its subsidiary Indofarma through \nthe RRC of APVAX for the delivery to MOH-designated locations of at least 65 million doses of \nCOVID-19 vaccine under the government-funded program. The agreed eligible expenditure items \nunder the RRC are (i) vaccines that meet any of the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria,47 including \nfor  any  advance payments;  and  (ii)  international  logistics  and  related  services  required  for  the \ntransportation of vaccines from the place of purchase to designated delivery points in Indonesia. \nBio  Farma  and Indofarma  have  entered  into  agreements  with  a  number  of  COVID-19  vaccine \nsuppliers, and the potential pathways for such vaccines to satisfy the eligibility criteria have been \nidentified.48  \n \nADB  technical  assistance  (TA)49  will  assist  smooth  distribution  of  COVID-19  vaccines. \n20. \nSupport will be given to (i) upgrade Bio Farma\u2019s vaccine logistics management information system \nto  incorporate  predictive  analytical  features  that  can  forecast  vaccine  demand  and  support \n\n \n\n44   Development Partner Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n45   ADB. 2020.

First,  knowledge  work  undertaken  by  ADB  helped \ninform the government\u2019s prioritization of vaccine access and deployment plans.50 Second, the low \nfinancing cost of the proposed ADB loan to Bio Farma for vaccine procurement will result in lower \nvaccine prices for the government as it seeks to vaccinate its citizens free of charge. Third, ADB \nTA support to upgrade Bio Farma\u2019s vaccine logistics management information system and provide \nrelated training and certification, including to women, will ensure that vaccines are deployed to \nappropriate locations expeditiously and with minimal risk of wastage. Fourth, ADB is supporting \nthe MOH to establish a new strategic delivery unit that will be closely involved in coordinating and \nmonitoring the implementation of the VAP.51 To ensure that Indonesia is adequately prepared for \nthe  next  pandemic,  ADB  is  planning  to  provide  financing  support  to  Bio  Farma  to  expand  its \ncapacity  to  produce  non-COVID-19  vaccines  through  a  project  tentatively  planned  for  Board \nconsideration later in 2021. ADB will support Indonesia\u2019s health sector reform strategy, and the \nalignment  of  national  vaccine  activities  and  COVID-19  recovery  plans  with  those  of  other \nmembers of Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \n \n22. \nIn 2020, ADB worked closely with MOH and UNICEF on the delivery of critical medical \nequipment and supplies through a $3.0 million grant under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response \nFund.52  In  April  2020,  ADB  committed  $1.5  billion  under  the  COVID-19  Active  Response  and \nExpenditure  Support  Program  to  provide  budget  support  for  urgent  public  health,  social,  and \neconomic assistance.53 In September 2020, ADB approved the $500 million Disaster Resilience \nImprovement  Program  to  help  manage  fiscal  risks  arising  from  future  disasters  triggered  by \nnatural  hazards  and  pandemics.54  The  following  lessons  from  these  interventions  have  been \nincorporated in to project design: (i) the need to leverage the knowledge and expertise of leading \nhealth sector agencies, such as WHO and UNICEF, in formulating the needs assessment and \nrisk mitigation measures, (ii) the importance of having a robust coordination mechanism among \nrelevant ministries through establishment of a steering committee, and (iii) the critical need for \nstrong data analytics capability in driving sound policy making through investments in information \ntechnology systems.      \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $795  million  (Table  4).

Because of its unique financing needs, Bio Farma has also requested that the loan \nhave  a  3-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  2  years.  This  is  because  Bio  Farma  has \ndetermined a 3-year loan term to be sufficient for it to complete the procurement and deployment \nof  COVID-19  vaccines  and  receive  full  payment  from  the  government  for  the  sale  of  such \nvaccines, the proceeds of which will be used to repay the loan. Since APVAX policy prescribes a \n10-year term for the RRC component (footnote 45), a Board waiver will be required for the shorter \nterm of 3 years.56 Such a waiver is justified on the basis that it better meets the financing needs \nof  Bio  Farma,  while  also  benefiting  ADB  through  lower  capital  utilization  and  liquidity \nrequirements. The loan will have its annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. For this loan, \nbased on a custom-tailored loan amortization schedule, the average maturity is 2.8 years, with no \nmaturity premium payable to ADB. Bio Farma has made its own independent decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility.  \n \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 5. In the event Bio Farma chooses to utilize loan \n25. \nproceeds to procure COVID-19 vaccine from the Serum Institute of India through Indofarma, then \n(i)  Bio Farma  shall  enter  into  an  onlending  agreement  with Indofarma,  and (ii)  Indofarma shall \nenter into a project agreement with ADB. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nBio Farma and Indofarma \n \n\nOrdinary capital resources (APVAX RRC loan) \n\nAPVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, RRC = rapid response component. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Bio Farma, and Indofarma estimates.  \n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n450.0 \n345.0 \n795.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n \n57 \n43 \n100 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n56   APVAX policy sets the terms for regular ordinary capital resources loans to Group C developing member countries \nat (i) up to the first $500 million, 10 years including a grace period of up to 3 years; and (ii) above $500 million, 5 \nyears including a grace period of up to 3 years. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n26. \nProcurement  will  be  carried  out  in  a  manner  consistent  with  simplified  and  expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nFollowing the APVAX policy (footnote 45), ADB member country procurement eligibility restriction \nwill be waived, and universal procurement will apply.

The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, \n28. \ncausing loss of lives and a major economic downturn. The achievement of herd immunity from \nCOVID-19 through vaccination will allow the resumption of economic activities that generate jobs \nand build human capital, and promote trade and investment domestically and internationally. \n \nFinancial  analysis.57  Bio  Farma  is  financially  strong  and  capable  of  absorbing  the \n29. \nadditional debt to be incurred to finance vaccine purchases. Financial covenants covering debt\u2013\nequity,  current,  and  debt  service  coverage  ratios  are  included  in  the  loan  agreement  with  Bio \nFarma for monitoring and compliance during project implementation. Indofarma, however, may \nencounter challenges in managing its debts once it borrows from Bio Farma to purchase vaccines \n\n57  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nfrom  the  Serum  Institute  of  India  because  of  the  large  size  of  the  loan  relative  to  Indofarma\u2019s \nequity base. Under the financial management action plan, ADB will require quarterly submission \nof debt\u2013equity, current, and debt service coverage ratios at Indofarma and consolidated group \nlevels for monitoring purposes.58  \n \nB. \n \n30. \nFinancial management. Based on the assessment, it is concluded that the overall pre-\nmitigated financial management risk of the project is substantial, partly because of Bio Farma\u2019s \nlack  of  experience  in  managing  and  administering  projects  funded  by  international  financing \ninstitutions  and  the  extraordinary  scale  of  COVID-19  vaccine  procurement  and  distribution. \nActions identified to mitigate risk include (i) supporting Bio Farma and Indofarma with a financial \nmanagement consultant; (ii) providing training to accounting and finance staff of Bio Farma and \nIndofarma on ADB\u2019s financial management and disbursement guidelines and policies; (iii) using \nthe One Data system to track vaccines and monitor implementation; (iv) ensuring independent \ninternal  audit,  oversight,  and  supervision  by  Indonesia\u2019s  Central  Financial  and  Development \nSupervisory Agency; and (v) annual audits conducted by Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Agency.  \n \nProcurement.59  Bio  Farma  and  Indofarma  have  experience  procuring  vaccines  from \n31. \ninternational  vaccine  suppliers.  In  2020,  Bio  Farma  and  Indofarma  bilaterally  negotiated  and \nsigned agreements with AstraZeneca Indonesia and Sinovac Life Sciences, and with the Serum \nInstitute of India, respectively, to purchase COVID-19 vaccines. These existing agreements were \nreviewed,  and  findings  documented  by  ADB  (footnote  59).  Procurement  risk  is  assessed  as \nmedium,  as  ADB\u2019s  support  is  based  on  its  review  of  the  existing,  and  any  future,  bilaterally \nnegotiated  agreements,  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  APVAX  policy  including  the  vaccine \neligibility criteria. The scale of procurement by Indofarma under the project is significantly larger \nthan its regular operation. To address possible resource constraints at Indofarma, Bio Farma will \nprovide administrative and logistical support as required.  \n \n32. \nAnticorruption.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  completed  in  respect  of  Bio  Farma  and \nIndofarma, and no significant integrity risks were identified. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  Bio  Farma,  and \nIndofarma. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote 55). \n \nC. \n \nKey  poverty  and  social  issues.60  The  project  will  have  positive  social  benefits  by \n33. \nincreasing the availability of vaccines and the chance for the population to be immunized, resulting \nin better health outcomes and enabling people to restore livelihoods, increase productivity, and \nimprove economic outcomes. Vulnerable men and women will be prioritized for vaccination in line \nwith the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization equity principles (para. 9). \nBio Farma employees, particularly women, will benefit from upskilling and certification through the \nproject.  \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n58   Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The project is categorized as some gender elements, considering Bio Farma\u2019s \n34. \ncommitment to undertake actions that benefit women. It seeks to accelerate progress in gender \nequality by supporting greater participation of women for skills development and certification in \nlogistics system management, a nontraditional profession for women in Indonesia. Further actions \nwill  be  identified  during  project  implementation.  ADB  will  recruit  a  gender  and  social  inclusion \nspecialist  to  support  Bio  Farma\u2019s  implementation  and reporting  on  gender  actions  through  the \ncollection and analysis of disaggregated data where appropriate. The government will ensure that \nwomen and all vulnerable population groups receive vaccinations in line with the VAP.  \n \nD. \n \n35. \nare as follows.61 \n \n36. \nEnvironment  (category  C).  The  administration  of  COVID-19  vaccines  will  result  in  a \ntemporary  increase  in  immunization  waste.  Immunization  waste  management  is  stipulated  in \nMinister Decrees 56/201562 and 18/2020,63 and technical guidelines (footnote 23). Current and \nplanned arrangements for the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of incremental \nmedical waste were reviewed and confirmed to be adequate.  \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for \n37. \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. None of the project activities will involve land acquisition and \ninvoluntary resettlement, and thus no resettlement plan is required for the project. In the event \ninvoluntary resettlement issues are identified during project implementation, a specific mitigation \nplan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n38. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples  safeguards,  and  there  is  no  need  to  prepare  an  indigenous  peoples  plan.  Indigenous \npeoples\u2019 culture, beliefs, and livelihood systems will not be negatively affected by the project.   \n \nE. \n \nConsidering that risks and required mitigation measures will evolve as vaccines continue \n39. \nto be rolled out, ADB will work with Bio Farma,  Indofarma, MOH, other relevant ministries and \nagencies,  other  development  partners,  and  civil  society  organizations  to  monitor  vaccination \nprogram rollout. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 7 and described \nin detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.64  \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nVaccine hesitancy \nincluding due to \npotential backlash \ncaused by \npronouncement of \nsanctions  \n\nTable 7: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\u2022  MOH  and  MCIT,  supported  by  UNICEF,  have  launched  tailored  communication \n\ncampaigns for health-workers and community and religious leaders. \n\n\u2022  UNICEF  is  supporting  the  government\u2019s  media  engagement  efforts  to  emphasize \npositive messaging on vaccinations, ensure responsible coverage of adverse effects \nfollowing immunization, and avoid misinformation on social media platforms. \n\n \n\n61  ADB.
