PROJECT DESCRIPTION \nA.  Rationale \n1.  The West Bengal north\u2013south transport corridor extends from Haldia port via Kolkata to \nthe northern parts of West Bengal. The corridor divides into routes to Nepal and Sikkim in the \nwest; and Assam, Bhutan, and the northeastern states of India in the east.1 A large portion of \nthe West Bengal corridor and the eastward links to Bangladesh were in deteriorated two-lane, \nintermediate lane, and single-lane standard. The National Highway 34 (NH-34), which forms the \nspine of the transport system in the corridor, provides the nearest access to ports (Kolkata and \nHaldia) for the northeastern states of India and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal. Two state \nhighways provide links from the border with Bangladesh to the north\u2013south corridor and the \nIndian national road network. An efficient transport system along the north\u2013south corridor would \nprovide  the  basis  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  West  Bengal  and  have \nsignificant implications for improving subregional economic cooperation. Connectivity through \nimproved  transport  has  important  implications  for  poverty  reduction,  as  new  economic \nopportunities  through  improved  market  linkages  and  employment  possibilities  could  be \ngenerated. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President: Proposed Loan to India for the West Bengal Corridor \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n ", "2   \n2.  At the time of project preparation, road transport, the dominant mode of transport in the \nstate of West Bengal, had a primary network of 17,623 kilometers (km) consisting of 1,966 km of \nnational highways, 3,388 km of state highways, 5,833 km of major district roads, and 6,436 km \nof other district roads. Of the primary network, 95% was paved. The state had a village and \nurban road network of 35,600 km, with 47% of the villages connected. Most of the primary \nnetwork was constructed before the 1980s. According to the report and recommendation of the \nPresident  (RRP),  \u201cthe  capacity  constraint  of  the  road  network  has  been  exacerbated  by \ninadequate attention to, and funding for, network maintenance, which hastened the deterioration \nof the state road system\u201d. Funding for road maintenance was less than 50% of the requirement \nin the last decade. There was a need for the funding gap for maintenance to be progressively \nreduced. Likewise, there was a need for the development of an effective road management \nsystem to maintain the existing road assets. \n \n3.  A 1998 Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) was provided to the \nGovernment of West Bengal (GWB) for the preparation of a strategy and investment plan to \ndevelop the north\u2013south corridor. It was completed in June 2000. It identified a number of high-\npriority multimodal transport infrastructure components for financing and implementation, with \nNH-34  as  the  highest  priority  component  in  terms  of  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction  impact,  strategic  importance,  and suitability for  public funding. Two  other  priority \ncomponents  were  the  connections  between  Haldia  and  Kolkata  and  the  national  highway \nnetwork, which were preparing detailed feasibility studies.  \nB.  Expected Impact  \n4.  The project was expected to reduce poverty in the project area by promoting economic \ngrowth and subregional cooperation. The impact indicators were economic development and \nimproved infrastructure in the north\u2013south corridor and subregional economic growth and social \ndevelopment. \nC.  Objectives or Expected Outcome  \n5.  The project\u2019s expected outcome was a developed transport infrastructure in the north\u2013\nsouth corridor. The outcome indicators were: (i) reduced transport costs by 15%, (ii) reduced \ntravel time by 34%, (iii) decrease in traffic congestion in urban areas, (iv) reduced occurrence of \naccidents, (v) increased rural incomes and reduced unemployment rate, and (vi) improved \naccess to health services and schools. The other expected project outcome was an improved \npolicy environment for the efficient delivery of transport infrastructure. The outcome indicators \nwere: (i) institutional development strategy for the Public Works Department, (ii) options for \nimproved road financing, (iii) improved corridor and transport sector management, and (iv) \nprivate  sector  development  through  a  pilot  public\u2013private  partnership  project  and  policy \nframework for private participation. \nD.  Outputs \n6.  The project was designed to improve the two-lane standard in 370 km of NH-34 from \nBarasat\u2013Raiganj (a corridor access component). Also, about 150 km of state highways from SH-\n1: Chakda\u2013Bangaon and SH-10: Gajol\u2013Hilli (subregional connectivity) were to be rehabilitated \nand improved to two\u2212lane standard with asphalt concrete pavements and paved shoulders. The \nthird output\u2014rural access roads (RARs)\u2014was improvement on roads, small bridges, and other \nrural infrastructure, which was to provide rural communities access to major roads.  \n ", "3 \n \nE.  Provision of Inputs \n7.  The initial project design was prepared through three TA projects with a combined value \nof  $450,000  (i.e.,  0.13%  of  the  appraisal  project  cost  and  0.34%  of  actual  project  cost) \nconducted  in  2001.2  At  appraisal, the  estimated  project  cost  was  $323  million  equivalent. \nForeign exchange cost was estimated at $204 million (63%), while local currency cost, including \ntaxes and duties, was estimated at $119 million equivalent (37%). The Government of India \nrequested and ADB agreed to provide a $210 million (65% of total project cost) loan to finance \nthe entire foreign exchange cost of $204 million and $6 million equivalent of local currency cost. \nThe central government and the GWB were to provide the remaining local currency cost of $113 \nmillion equivalent. The portion of the loan relating to the state highways and RAR components \nfor $61.3 million, was to be onlent to GWB. At project completion, the actual total project cost \nwas $133.6 million, of which $79.2 million was a loan from ADB and $54.4 million in government \ncontribution. \n \n8.  The project environmental impact was assessed as Category B. The initial environment \nexamination  report  at  appraisal  indicated  the  project  would  not  have  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  (RRP,  Appendix  9).  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  was \nstrengthened with environmental staff, and an environmental monitoring cell was established to \nimplement the environmental mitigation and monitoring plan. Resettlement plans were prepared. \nAll statutory environmental clearances and approvals for the subprojects were obtained, and the \nenvironmental clearance conditions were complied with. The project completion report (PCR)3 \nindicated that  there were no complaints received from the public on environmental issues. \n \n9.  Consulting  services  were  provided  to  assist  the  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and \nHighways (MORTH) implement the improvement works at NH-34, and the GWB implement the \nimprovement of state highways 1 (SH-1) and 10 (SH-10) and the RARs. For Contract 1\u2013NH-34, \n375 person-months of international and 2,385 person-months of domestic consultants were \nestimated. For Contract 2\u2013SH-1, SH-10, and RARs, 90 person-months of international and \n1,530 person-months of domestic consultants were to be utilized (RRP, Appendix 8, Table \nA8.3).  At  project  completion,  5,877.5  person-months  of  consulting  services  were  provided, \nincluding  162.9  person-months  for  international  and  5,714.6  person-months  for  domestic \nconsultants (PCR, para. 20). \n \n10.  The  project  was  to  be  implemented  over  60  months,  inclusive  of  design  and  pre-\nconstruction activities, with planned completion by June 2007. The project\u2019s actual completion \nwas June 2011, 4 years after the planned completion date. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n11.  MORTH  was  the  executing  agency  for  the  national  highway  component,  and West \nBengal  Public  Works  (Roads)  Department  (WBPWRD)  for  the  state  highway  and  RAR \ncomponents.  The  PCR  noted  both  MORTH  and  WBPWRD  had  previous  experience  in \nimplementing ADB projects in the road subsector. PIUs were established to implement the \n                                                \n2  The three TAs were: (i) TA 3538-IND: Preliminary Engineering for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project \nfor $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000; (ii) TA 3539-IND: Resettlement and Environmental Assessment for \nthe West Bengal Corridor Development Project for $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000; and (iii) TA 3540-\nIND: Economic and Poverty Analysis for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project for $150,000, approved on \n13 November 2000. \n3  ADB. 2012. Completion Report: West Bengal Corridor Development Project in India. Manila. \n ", "4   \nproject,  to  be  staffed  with  experienced  personnel,  and  were  to  be  delegated  sufficient \nadministrative  authority.  The  staff  received  contract  management  and  social  development \ntraining, including resettlement under two ADB advisory TA projects. \n \n12.  The  PCR  noted  that  the  PIU  for  the  state  highway  and  RAR  components  was \nestablished in 1997 to implement a World Bank project and it was subsequently designated to \nimplement the project in 2002. With the assistance of consultants, the PIU implemented all \naspects of the project including preparation, contract and financial management, construction \nsupervision, and environmental and safeguard measures, among other things.  \n \n13.  The project had significant delays as WBPWRD was unable to fully mobilize the PIU \nand  procure  consultants  even  with  advance  action  approved  by  ADB.  Some  civil  works \ncontracts were terminated due to poor performance and re-procurement contributed to the \ndelays. In addition, land acquisition for some road sections was delayed due to court cases \nand disputes (PCR, paras.13\u201314). Of the 15 loan covenants, 12 were complied with and three \nwere partially complied with. The covenant on benefit and monitoring and project performance \nmonitoring system was partially complied with. The GWB had partially complied with the \ncovenant on formulating a comprehensive, fully integrated road infrastructure development \nstrategy and road financing master plan, and the covenant on addressing vehicle overloading. \n \n14.  In 2005, MORTH, in consultation with GWB, informed the Department of Economic \nAffairs and ADB of the government\u2019s decision to upgrade NH-34 to four lanes. This change was \nintended to align NH-34 with the government\u2019s overall strategy of upgrading major national \nhighways to four lanes. The change would require new detailed designs and other pre-project \nactivities, including additional land acquisition and resettlement plans. The PCR indicated this \noption was not considered to be practical under the loan, given the loan closing schedule and \nthe time that already elapsed. Therefore, ADB agreed to cancel this component of the loan \ntotaling $116.3 million (PCR, para. 6).  \n \n15.  During project preparation, a detailed social analysis was carried out in accordance with \nADB guidelines. The principal adverse social impact was the dislocation of the roadside small \nbusiness enterprises. A 2001 census generated a full inventory of assets and nature of losses \nby those to be relocated. A total of 9,200 small business enterprises,1,300 households, and 452 \ncommunity properties were to be affected. These parties were largely informal settlers and \nencroachers on the right-of-way, particularly around bus stops, road intersections, rural markets, \nand town centers. \n \n16.  The PCR indicated that at appraisal, the resettlement plans were prepared mainly based \non  the  preliminary  socioeconomic  assessment,  which  resulted  in  a  large  variation  in  the \nestimated number of affected people and utility relocations during implementation. The PCR \nindicated that compensation and assistance were provided even to people with no land titles but \nwere considered to be affected by the project in accordance with ADB guidelines. Compensation \nand special assistance to vulnerable people was also monitored. \n \n17.  As of 2012, the PCR noted the following: (i) 5.7 hectares of land was acquired for the \nstate highways (no land acquired for the RARs); (ii) 7,141 people were affected, including 1,576 \nlegal land title holders and 5,565 informal dwellers and small business enterprises; (iii) 399 legal \nland title holders made voluntary land donations of 2.48 hectares for the RARs; (iv) 102 common \nproperty resources were restored or replaced; (v) total costs were Rs113.47 million, including \nRs73.35 million for the acquisition of land and assets, and Rs40.12 million for resettlement and \nrehabilitation; (vi) all compensation and assistance costs for affected people were disbursed; ", "5 \n \nand (vii) most of the affected people (98%) rebuilt their shops and business establishments and \nare earning their livelihood in the same place (PCR, para. 38). \n \nII.  EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE AND RATINGS \nA.  Relevance of Design and Formulation \n18.  The PCR rated the project highly relevant. It noted the project was consistent with the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction by developing highways and \nRARs. India\u2019s 9th to 12th five-year plans (FYP) consistently aimed to achieve a balanced \ndevelopment  of  the  road  network\u2014comprising  the  primary  (national  highways  and \nexpressways), secondary (state highways and major district roads), and rural roads.4 The plans \naimed at phased removal of deficiencies in the existing NH network with emphasis on upgrading \nhigh-density corridors into four lanes, and improving the quality of life in rural areas. These were \nintended to ensure balanced regional development by achieving the PMGSY target of providing \nconnectivity through all-weather roads to all habitations with a population of over 500 persons \n(as per the 2001 census).5  \n \n19.  The PCR noted the ADB country partnership strategy (CPS) for India supported the \ngovernment's efforts addressing some of the constraints identified in the 9th, 10th, and 11th \nFYPs, including strengthening the infrastructure development of the poorer states, regional \ncooperation,  and  promoting  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  infrastructure.  The  ADB  Country \nPartnership  Strategy  2013\u20132017  for  India  supported  India\u2019s  12th  FYP  by  focusing  on \ninfrastructure development to support more rapid growth, attract private investment, improve \nconnectivity, and create and improve access to jobs and investments anchored on the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation program with emphasis on economic corridors.6 Road \ntransport is the dominant mode of transport in the state of West Bengal (para. 2). The project \nresponded to the needs of the existing system by improving the quality of state highways and \nrural roads.  \n \n20.  The validation notes that ADB funding for the corridor access component was cancelled. \nAt  appraisal,  about  370  km  of  NH-34  were  proposed  for  upgrading  to  two-lane  standard. \nHowever, in December 2005, during implementation, the government decided to upgrade NH-34 \nto four lanes using its own funds, to align NH-34 with the overall national strategy of upgrading \nmajor  national  highways  to  four-lane  standards.  The  cancellation  resulted  in  a  significant \nreduction in project outputs (removal of 370 km highway) and loan size (cancelled $231 million \nof $323 million). It also meant initial works for land acquisition and resettlement under NH-34 \nduring January 2003\u2013December 2005 were foregone. The total cost reduction was Rs41.5 \nmillion (PCR, footnote 8).  \n \n                                                \n4  Planning Commission, Government of India. 9th Five Year Plan, 1996\u20132001; 10th Five Year Plan, 2002\u20132007; 11th \nFive Year Plan, 2007\u20132012; 12th Five Year Plan, 2013\u20132017. New Delhi. \n5  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojanawas (PMGSY) was launched in October 2000. Its primary objective is to \nprovide connectivity, by way of all-weather roads, to the unconnected habitations in the rural areas, so that \nhabitations with a population of 1,000 and above are covered in a span of 3 years (2000\u20132003). All unconnected \nhabitations with a population of 500 persons and above are to be covered by the end of the 10th plan period \n(2007). As to the hill states (north\u2013east, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttaranchal) and the \ndesert areas, the objective is to connect habitations with a population of 250 persons and above. The program, as \na related objective, also aimed to achieve an equitable development of the rural roads network in different states \nand/or districts so as to fully exploit the latent potential for rural growth. The PMGSY is being implemented as a \n100% centrally sponsored scheme (Planning Commission, Government of India. 2007. 10th Five Year Plan, 2002\u2013\n2007. New Delhi). \n6   ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2013\u20132017. Manila. ", "6   \n21.  During the validation process, the South Asia Regional Department (SARD) explained \nthat a four-lane option was considered at appraisal but was not adopted because it was not \neconomically viable and the two-lane alternative was found to be the least cost solution at that \ntime. Also, government was not ready to conceptualize the entire road development plan during \nthat period. The upgrade of NH-34 was expected to be done incrementally by widening from two \nto four-lanes after 2015 when the two-lane road reaches its capacity (RRP, Appendix 11, \nfootnote 1).  \n \n22.  The validation recognizes the decision to upgrade NH-34 to four lanes ahead of time was \nmade by the government. Also, as explained by SARD, given the remaining project time, it was \nnot possible for ADB to finance the four-lane upgrade and therefore the NH-34 component was \ncancelled from the loan. However, the validation is of the view that the government\u2019s plan to \nupgrade the NH-34 to four lanes just 3 years after the project was approved should have been \ngenerally anticipated during the project preparatory stage since the NH-34 was the spine of the \nnorth-south transport system and the government\u2019s strategy to upgrade major national highways \nto four-lane standards was already indicated in the 9th Five Year Plan of India for 1997\u20132002.7 \nThe cancellation of the project\u2019s main component reduced more than two thirds of the target \noutputs. At completion, the $323 million project became $133.6 million (41% of original design) \nand ADB\u2019s loan reduced from $210 million to $79.3 million (38% utilization), largely due to the \ncancellation of the NH-34 component. This huge reduction in the project scope implied an \ninadequate sector assessment during preparation and a significant shortcoming in the project \ndesign. The validation agrees with the PCR that the state highways and the RAR components \nremained relevant to the objectives of boosting economic development in the project area. On \nthese bases, the validation considers a highly relevant rating unjustified and assesses the \nproject relevant.8  \n \nB.  Effectiveness in Achieving Project Outcome and Outputs \n \n23.  The PCR rated the project effective in achieving its purposes and outcomes. It indicated \nthat the project improved 149.2 km of the state highway, some 9.2 km more than the 140 km \ntarget. It also indicated that vehicle travel speeds on the project roads improved to about 60\u201380 \nkm per hour (from 20\u201350 km per hour before the project), resulting in travel time savings (PCR, \npara. 27). For the RAR component, the PCR indicated that 81.7 km was improved out of a \ntarget of 100 km. Most roads were in very poor condition before the project with some sections \nprone to disruption during the rainy season. It indicated that the average vehicle travel speed of \n40\u201360 km per hour reduced both travel time and transport costs, and stimulated transport \nrelated services. Rural incomes increased by 10%\u201315% per year upon completion of the project \nroads (PCR, para.27).  \n \n24.  The  PCR  indicated some gains  in  reducing  transport  costs  and  travel  time for the \nremaining components. Based on the traffic counts, the annual average daily traffic in 2011 was \n2,382 vehicles on SH-1 and 2,934 on SH-10 (PCR, Appendix 10, Table A10.1). These traffic \nflows were about two thirds of the 2010 traffic forecasts of 3,228 and 4,575 for SH-1 and SH-10, \nrespectively (RRP, Appendix 11, Table A11.3). The PCR claimed improved access to health \nservices and schools, but did not provide supporting data. In addition, the validation notes that \nat project completion, 12 of the 15 loan covenants were complied with, while the other three \ncovenants were partially complied with (PCR, Appendix 8). These were: (i) the covenant on \n                                                \n7 Government  of  India.  1997.  9th  Five  Year  Plan  Document.  Planning  Commission.  New  Delhi. \nhttp://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/9th/vol2/v2c7-1.htm \n8  The regional department disagrees with the downgrade of the PCR rating.  ", "7 \n \nperformance  monitoring  data  (the  report  submitted  in  2012  was  too  simple  for  future \nmonitoring);  (ii)  the  covenant  on  road  infrastructure  development  strategy  including  road \nmaintenance strategy and road financing master plan (as at PCR preparation, work to formulate \nthe strategy was still ongoing); and (iii) the covenant on vehicle overloading on RARs (concrete \nmeasures did not seem to have been undertaken). The validation is of the view that the project \nunderperformed in the remaining components and that the project\u2019s overall expected outputs and \noutcomes were not fully achieved. On these bases, the validation assesses the project less than \neffective.9 \n \nC.  Efficiency of Resource Use in Achieving Outcome and Outputs  \n \n25.  The PCR rated the project efficient, given the results of the economic reevaluation, \ndespite  an  extended  project  implementation  period.  The  PCR  noted  that  after  project \ncompletion,  traffic  flow  increased  and  better  traffic  flows  are  expected  once  the  NH-34  is \nupgraded into four lanes. Traffic on SH-1 and on SH-10 had increased, but was lower than \nforecast at appraisal (para. 24). Since the appraisal did not make any forecast on RAR traffic, \nno comparison was made for the RAR component.  \n \n26.  The validation notes a four-year delay in project completion (Target: June 2007; Actual: \nJune 2011). Implementation activities were delayed by the shortage of PIU staff and procedural \ndelays.  Some  civil  works  contracts  were  terminated  due  to  poor  performance  resulting  in \nrepeated procurements. Land acquisition for some road sections was delayed due to court \ncases and disputes. Civil works were completed in January 2010 for SH-1, June 2011 for SH-\n10, and between August 2008\u2013June 2011 for the RARs. Moreover, the actual cost for the \nremaining components and, despite the under achievement of RAR km, was 45% higher than \nthe estimated cost at appraisal (Appraisal: $92 million; Actual: $133.6 million). In addition, as a \nresult  of  the  cancellation  of  NH-34,  the  GWB  incurred  a  cost  of  Rs41.5  million  for  land \nacquisition and resettlement (PCR, footnote 8). The implementation delays had resulted in the \ninvestment cost flow of over 9\u201310 years and delayed the benefit flows by several years. \n \n27.  The  PCR  recalculated the  economic  internal rate  of  return (EIRR)  using  the  same \nmethodology at appraisal, but it added 20% to the vehicle operating cost and time cost savings \nto  reflect  other  benefits  such  as  socioeconomic  development  in  the  project  area,  poverty \nreduction, and maintenance cost savings (PCR, Appendix 10, para. 4). The validation considers \nsuch added benefits arbitrary and not justified. Moreover, the PCR did not adjust the benefit \nflows to the actual opening to service of the project roads. To correct the EIRR for these factors, \nthe validation recalculated the EIRRs using the data provided in the PCR (Appendix 10, Table \nA10.3-Table A10.6), assuming no additional benefits and adjusting for civil works completion \nconservatively by 2 years based on the work schedule provided in Appendix 6 of the PCR,. The \nresulting EIRRs for the whole project, SH-1, SH-10, and RARs were 11.2%, 9.8%, 12%, and \n9.6%, respectively, compared to 17.1%, 15.9%, 16.9%, and 19.3% as reported in the PCR \n(PCR, para. 30). The project turned out hardly economically viable and therefore, the validation \nassesses the project less than efficient.10 \n \nD.  Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability  \n \n28.  The PCR rated the project likely to be sustainable. In West Bengal, the WBPWRD is \nresponsible for  road maintenance.  It  has  a  well-developed  institutional framework for road \n                                                \n9  The regional department disagrees with the downgrade of the PCR rating. \n10 The regional department disagrees with the downgrade of the PCR rating. ", "8   \nmaintenance,  with  routine  maintenance  undertaken  by  its  regional  field  offices,  and  large \nmaintenance  projects,  including  periodic  maintenance  implemented  through  procurement \nmanaged at its headquarters. The state government constituted a road advisory board that will \nformulate  state  road  policy  and  strategic  planning,  prepare  a  sector  road  map,  and  set \nbenchmarks for quality standards. To enhance financing for road development, the government \npassed the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Fund Act 2002. The revenue \ncollected is shared between the WBPWRD and the State Transport Department on a 60:40 \nbasis. According to the WBPWRD, the current allocation for road maintenance is higher than \nthe  average  allocation  for  the  past  5  years  and  adequate  funds  will  be  provided  for  the \nmaintenance of project roads (PCR, para. 32). To control overloaded vehicles, the WBPWRD \ncoordinates with district administrations to check axle load, in consultation with the Transport \nDepartment. The PCR noted that the loan covenant on a road infrastructure development \nstrategy was partially complied with. Likewise, the formulation of the strategy, including a road \nfinancing master plan, was ongoing at the time of PCR preparation (PCR, Appendix 8). \n \n29.  This validation notes that the PCR did not show whether or not road maintenance funds \nhave  been  provided  after  project  completion.  However,  according  to  the  India  Resident \nMission,11 the road stretches, as improved by ADB funding under the project, were all turned \nover to the concerned local divisions of the Public Works Department. As reported by the \nconcerned local officers, the pavement conditions are good and are being maintained by the \nbudgetary provision of the department. Releases of the West Bengal budget for 2014\u20132015 \nindicated that nearly Rs17.8 billion were allocated to the Public Works Department and Rs4 \nbillion to the Transport Department.12 In view of these findings, this validation assesses the \nproject likely sustainable.  \nE.  Impact  \n30.  The PCR mission conducted a quick survey and consultations with stakeholders during \nsite visits. It indicated the project: (i) stimulated rapid socioeconomic development in the project \narea; (ii) significantly improved transport conditions and connectivity; (iii) sharply increased \ncross-border traffic; (iv) increased land prices along the project roads by about 3\u20135 times; (v) \nprovided additional employment opportunities during and after the project; and (vi) increased \naccess to various services, such as education, hospitals, banking, and grain markets (PCR, \npara. 39). It also indicated the project has contributed to economic development in the project \narea by improving the state road infrastructure in the north\u2013south transport system. Cross-\nborder connectivity with Bangladesh improved. Socioeconomic development in West Bengal \nwas  rapidly  improving.  During  2009\u20132010,  the  gross  state  domestic  product  was  Rs3,989 \nbillion, with an 8.4% annual growth rate. Local people have better access to social centers and \nfacilities, like hospitals, schools, banks, and others (PCR, Appendix 1). Based on these findings, \nthe validation rates the project\u2019s impact significant. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n11 Based on an email exchange between the resident mission and IED on 27 June 2014. \n12 Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt.

OTHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS \nA.  Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency \n31.  The PCR rated the performance of the borrower and executing agency satisfactory. The \nborrower was the Government of India while the executing agencies were the MORTH for the \nnational highway component, and the WBPWRD for the state highway and RAR components. \nWith the cancellation of the national highway component, only the Ministry of Finance, the \nFinance Department of West Bengal, and the WBPWRD participated in the coordination and \nmonitoring of project implementation. The GWB provided $54.4 million equivalent of counterpart \nfunding for the project. The state government and the PIU supported all ADB missions.  \n \n32.  Project completion was delayed significantly by a total of 4 years. The PIU was not fully \nmobilized and the recruitment of consultants started only 2 years after loan effectiveness due to \nshortage  of  staff  and  procedural  delays.  Some  civil  works  contracts  were  terminated  and \nrequired new procurement due to poor performance. In addition, land acquisition for some road \nsections was delayed due to court cases and disputes (PCR, paras.13\u201314). Of the 15 loan \ncovenants, three were partially complied with (PCR, Appendix 8). This validation views the \noverall performance of the borrower and the executing agency less than satisfactory. \nB.  Performance of the Asian Development Bank  \n33.  The PCR rated the performance of ADB satisfactory. The project was processed at the \nresident mission, which was responsible for project administration. ADB was closely involved in \nidentifying and resolving issues and conducted capacity building on operations-related themes \nfor project officials. It provided inputs to the PIUs in preparing detailed action plans to expedite \nfield  progress.  ADB  conducted  10  regular  loan  review  missions  and  five  special  review \nmissions,  including  the  midterm  review.  Approval  of  documents  at  the  processing  and \nimplementation  stages  and  claims  for  payment  were  processed  and  disbursed  without \nunreasonable delays. The government recognized the role of the ADB missions in providing \ntimely advice on project matters. This validation considers ADB performance satisfactory. \nIV.  OVERALL ASSESSMENT, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS  \nA.  Overall Assessment and Ratings \n34.  The validation rates the project less than successful. The project\u2019s strategic importance \nwas well established. However, the project was not fully implemented as planned at appraisal. \nThe adjustment made by the government in the technical specification of the NH-34 resulted in \nthe cancellation of more than two thirds of the project\u2019s design outputs and loan. On balance, the \nvalidation rates the project relevant. The project\u2019s remaining components achieved some gains in \nreducing transport costs and travel time, but underperformed in RAR outputs as well as some \nother outcome indicators. The validation considers that the project\u2019s overall expected outputs and \noutcomes were not fully achieved, and therefore, as a whole, rates the project less than effective. \nOn efficiency, implementation activities extended and project completion was delayed by four \nyears. The actual cost of the remaining components was 45% higher than estimated. The PCR\u2019s \nrecalculated EIRRs added 20% as additional benefits without sufficient justification and did not \nadjust for the delays in the benefit streams. A partial amendment for these flaws shows that the \nproject was hardly economically viable. Given these findings, the validation rates the project less \nthan efficient. The validation agrees that the project is likely sustainable, given the institutional \nframework for road maintenance and the availability of financial resources from road user fees. ", "10   \nThe GWB had the required institution that had responsibility over road maintenance, although its \ncapacity needs enhancement. \nOverall Ratings \n  Criteria  PCR  IED Review  Reason for Disagreement  \nand/or Comments \nRelevance  Highly relevant  Relevant  The cancellation of the project\u2019s main \ncomponent NH-34 reduced by more \nthan two thirds the appraisal outputs \nand loan, and implied an inadequate \nsector assessment during preparation \nand shortcoming in the project design \n(paras. 20-22).  \nEffectiveness in  Effective  Less than  The project underperformed in the \nachieving outcome and  effective  remaining components, and the \noutputs  project\u2019s overall expected outputs and \noutcomes were not fully achieved.  \n(paras. 23\u201324). \nEfficiency in achieving  Efficient  Less than  Implementation activities extended and \noutcome and outputs  efficient  completion was delayed by 4 years. \nActual cost of remaining components \nwas 45% higher than estimated.

The executing agency did not \nmobilize the PIU and recruit \nconsultants on time. Some civil works \ncontracts were terminated and required \nnew procurement. Land acquisition \nwas delayed due to court cases and \ndisputes. Overall, the completion was \nsignificantly delayed. Three of the 15 \nloan covenants were partially complied \nwith at loan closing. \nPerformance of ADB  Satisfactory  Satisfactory   \nQuality of PCR    Satisfactory  Refer to para. 39. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  IED  =  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment, NH = national highway, PCR = project completion report, PIU = project implementation unit. \nNote: From May 2012, IED views the PCR rating terminology of \"partly\" or \"less\" as equivalent to \"less than\" and \nuses this terminology for its own rating categories to improve clarity. \nSource: ADB Independent Evaluation Department. \n \n \n \n ", "11 \n \nB.  Lessons \n35.  The PCR identified four lessons from the project in the areas of: (i) project readiness,  (ii) \ncapacity of the implementation agency, (iii) tight monitoring and control, and (iv) land acquisition \nand resettlement. The validation generally agrees with these lessons. In addition, the validation \npoints to the need to keep abreast of the government\u2019s medium-term plan during the project \nappraisal. The cancellation of the NH-34 component could have been avoided if the government \nhad been forthright about its plans. However, the existing 9th Five Year Plan of India during \nappraisal had already indicated the upgrading of major national roads to four lanes, and this \nshould have raised concerns and brought to the attention of the Government of India so that \ncancellation could have been avoided. \n \nC.  Recommendations for Follow-Up  \n \n36.  The  resident  mission  should  follow  up  with  the  GWB  on  actions  taken  on  the \nrecommendations to update the project benefits monitoring and evaluation survey. There is a \nneed to conduct the necessary follow-up surveys for future use. \n \n37.  Also, the resident mission should follow up on the compliance of the GWB in completing \na comprehensive, fully-integrated road infrastructure development strategy, including a road \nmaintenance strategy and a road financing master plan that will review the mechanisms for the \nincreased domestic funding of the road requirements, including the option for establishing a \nstate road fund. This will help ensure the sustainability of project roads. \nV.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP \nA.  Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization \n38.  The ADB completion review mission determined that the follow-on survey to the baseline \nsurvey  was  inadequate.  Given  that  the  resident  mission  was  responsible  for  project \nadministration, action to improve the survey results should have been taken immediately. The \nmeasurement of the socioeconomic impacts and findings was superficial. \n \nB.  Comments on Project Completion Report Quality \n \n39.  The validation rates the PCR quality satisfactory. However, it notes a few areas that the \nPCR could improve. The update survey of the PCR was inadequate and did not demonstrate the \nproject\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. The methodology used in the PCR to quantify project benefits \nwas not consistent with established practices in valuation and estimation of economic benefits. \nThe recalculation of EIRR did not adjust the benefit streams for the actual opening to service of \nthe project roads (para. 27).    \n \nC.   Data Sources for Validation \n \n40.  Data sources for the validation include the project\u2019s report and recommendation of the \nPresident; PCR; ADB loan review missions to India; 9th Five Year Plan, 1997\u20132002; 10th Five \nYear Plan, 2002\u20132007; 11th Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012; 12th Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017; ADB \nCountry Assistance Plan for India, 2001\u20132003; ADB Country Partnership Strategy, 2003\u20132006 \nfor India; and ADB Country Partnership Strategy, 2009\u20132012 for India. \n \n ", "12   \nD.  Recommendation for Independent Evaluation Department Follow-Up \n41.  The validation recommends the preparation of a project performance evaluation report \nonly after sufficient time has elapsed in the upgrading of the NH-34 to four lanes. This report \nwould evaluate the project\u2019s impact on the remaining road projects (SH-1 and SH-10) and \nmeasure the impacts of the RARs, which were not reviewed well in the PCR.
