Roshan is the clear \nleader in Afghanistan\u2019s mobile telecommunications market. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas assisted Roshan\u2019s growth in a phased manner. In November 2004, ADB approved a loan of \n$35 million to finance the phase I expansion of Roshan\u2019s mobile cellular telephony network and \nrestructuring of its capital base very shortly after it started operations.2 To cater for tremendous \nconsumer demand for mobile telecom services,  ADB provided a further loan of $50 million (of \nwhich  $15  million  was  funded  by  commercial  banks  under  a  B-loan),  and  a  political  risk \nguarantee of $10 million to finance phase II expansion toward the goal of countrywide coverage \nin June 2007.3 The loans are fully drawn, repayments have started on schedule, and Roshan is \nin compliance (subject to waivers granted by ADB) with all loan covenants, including reporting \nrequirements. Roshan has exceeded its growth targets since its launch on 27 July 2003 and has \nweathered  a  degree  of  recent  market  dislocation  caused  by  vigorous  competition  (itself  a  key \nsignal of the success of this sector of the Afghan economy), a situation that is now normalizing.    \n \n3. \nPhase  III\u2014Substantial  Unmet  Demand.  Roshan  has  consistently  maintained  its \nposition  as  the  largest  mobile  telecom  company  in  Afghanistan,  with  over  40%  of  the  market \nshare (about 12% more than its nearest competitor). The proposed phase III expansion aims at \nensuring  that  mobile  telecom  services  reach  almost  all  semi-urban  and  major  rural  areas\u2014\nachieving significant levels of population coverage, adding and upgrading network capacity, and \nenhancing economies of scale for more affordable mobile telecom services in the face of strong \ncompetition.  Currently,  Roshan\u2019s  network  covers 4  17  million  Afghans,  about  54%  of  the \npopulation.5  Financing will also support the deployment of new services such as the innovative \nmobile banking, M-Paisa6, and the use of green technology in the form of solar panels in place \nof diesel generators. \n \n4. \nRoshan\u2019s  Request  for  Financing.  To  finance  this  phase  III  expansion,  Roshan  had \ninitially  requested  an  additional  aggregate  debt  funding  of  about  $105  million  from  ADB  and \nother current and prospective senior lenders, together with additional funding from shareholders. \nThe concept of this Project was cleared on 16 May 2008, and due diligence was carried out in \n\n                                                 \n1   Opening speech to the ADB 2008 Annual Meeting in Madrid. \n2  ADB. 2004.

Roshan\u2019s phase I expansion in 2004 was the first private \nsector intervention of its kind in recent Afghan history. The nation had not seen any significant \nprivate  sector  investment  in  almost  30  years  because  of  its  difficult  political  and  security \nsituation. Notwithstanding the challenges, over the past 4 years Roshan has become the largest \nsingle  taxpayer  in  Afghanistan,  accounting  for  about  6%\u20137%  of  domestically  generated,  non-\ndonor,  government  revenue.  It  is  considered  one  of  the  soundest  private  sector  companies  in \nAfghanistan, with the highest standards of corporate governance and the most profound impact \non the lives of Afghans throughout the country and throughout society. As a result of its success, \nthe telecom market in Afghanistan has become one of the most openly competitive sectors of \nthe economy, receiving far more foreign direct investment than any other. The telecoms market \nis  touted  as  one  of  the  great  successes  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  economic  liberalization  and \nrenaissance, and an example for the rest of the economy.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE, SECTOR PERFORMANCE,  \nISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nTelecommunications Services Sector in Afghanistan \n\n6. \nLeapfrogging  into  Mobile  Telephony.  After  more  than  two  and  a  half  decades  of \nconflict,  Afghanistan  had  no  basic  transport  and  communication  infrastructure.  However,  the \nAfghanistan telecom market has grown at an unprecedented pace since Roshan\u2019s entry. In the \ntelecoms  market,  1  Afghan  year  is  considered  equivalent  to  as  many  as  10 years  in  other \ncountries,  since  the  rate  of  adoption  has  been  so  explosive  and  transformational.  The  less \ncapital-intensive  nature  of  mobile  telephony,  and  the  lower  rollout  complexity,  has  allowed  the \nAfghanistan  telecom  market  to  leapfrog  the  conventional  development  stages  of  fixed  line \ntelephone systems.  \n \n7. \nA  Vital  Element  of  Life.  Mobile  telephony  is  regarded  as  the  only  viable  means  of \nproviding  reliable,  nationwide  communication  capacity  in  Afghanistan.  This  is  evidenced  by \nalmost  universal  dependence\u2014including  the  foreign  security  and  donor  communities,  the \nGovernment,  and  business\u2014on  the  cellular  network  for  the  most  basic  operations.  Recent \nservice  interruptions  caused  by  Taliban  insurgents,  and  the  strong  reaction  to  these \ninterruptions  by  the  affected  communities,  demonstrate  how  vital  mobile  telecommunications \nhave become in the everyday lives of the Afghan people.  \n \n8. \nEssential  for  Afghanistan\u2019s  Development.  In  a  war  torn  country  with  45%  of  the \npopulation under 15 years old, the need to gain knowledge, exchange ideas, and connect with \nothers is vital for the nation\u2019s development. ADB-commissioned studies show that the economic \nbenefits of telecommunications (particularly in rural areas) are broader, and benefit-cost ratios are \nhigher, than indicated by usual project economic analyses.7  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Telecommunications Projects. Manila; and ADB. 1995. Technical \nAssistance  to  Thailand  for  a  Socioeconomic  Impact  Study  of  Rural  Telecommunications.  Manila  (TA  2381-THA). \nThese studies conclude that the economic benefits of telecommunications are at least twice what subscribers pay for \nthe  service,  and  much  higher  for  some  user  groups.  Additional  benefits  are  derived  in  education,  employment, \nagriculture, environment, health, and safety. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\n  \n\nMobile  Telephony  and  its  Development  Impact.  The  widely  cited  example  of \n9. \nBangladesh\u2019s GrameenPhone expansion financing8 is worth repeating, as it has a similar profile \nand rationale to the Roshan phase III expansion with its focus on semi-urban and rural areas. \nThe  identified  development  impacts  for  the  GrameenPhone  financing  were:  (i)  continued \nexpansion  of  the  telecommunication  sector,  which  had  large  unmet  demand  and  un-serviced \ngeographical  regions;  (ii)  the  expanded  role  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME) \nservice  providers,  which  are  subcontractors  of  GrameenPhone;  (iii)  expansion  of  village  pay \ntelephones \nfor  GrameenPhone\u2019s  unique \ncontributions to good governance in the Bangladesh telecommunications sector.  \n \nB. \n\nto  un-serviced  rural  areas;  and  (iv)  support \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nLow  Penetration.  Coverage has grown remarkably in the last 4 years, but it is still far \n10. \nfrom  nationwide.  Significant  additional  investment  is  required,  particularly  to  reach  the  more \ndispersed  and  underserved  segments  of society.  Afghanistan\u2019s  penetration  rate9 is  only  a  little \nover  12%.  Compared  to  similar  size  markets  (Table  1),  Afghanistan  has  significant  growth \npotential  (e.g.,  the  penetration  rate  in  Kenya  is  32%).  Kenya\u2019s  relatively  high  penetration  rate, \nnotwithstanding  relatively  low  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita,  has  been  boosted  by \nan  innovative  mobile  payment  system  called  M-Pesa  which  was  launched  in  March  2007  by \nSafaricom,  Kenya\u2019s  largest  mobile  operator  and  an  affiliate  of  Vodafone.  Vodafone  is  teaming \nup with Roshan introducing a similar product called M-Paisa in Afghanistan.  \n \n\nTable 1: Penetration Rate of Similar Markets \n\n \n\nEconomy \nAfghanistan \nYemen \nKenya \nTanzania \n\nPopulation \n(million) \n31.9 \n22.4 \n37.5 \n40.5 \n\n< Age 15 \nYears  \n(%) \n  48 \n45 \n43 \n44 \n\nGDP Per \nCapita \n($) \n1,000 \n1,010 \n1,344 \n837 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Roshan and Asian Development Bank estimates (2007 data). \n \nC. \n\nAnalysis of Key Issues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nDynamic Market Environment \n\nSubscribers \n(million) \n4.0 \n4.1 \n11.5 \n8.4 \n\nOperators \n4 \n3 \n3 \n6 \n\nPenetration \n(%) \n12.4 \n18.2 \n31.9 \n21.7 \n\nInvestment in the Afghan Mobile Telecom Market\u2014Largest Revenue Generator.

As  described  in  the  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy, 10  private  sector \ndevelopment plays a key role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The rapid development of the \ntelecommunications sector has acted as a prime example of how a relatively effective enabling \nenvironment  can  spur  private  sector  development  in  Afghanistan.  The  sector  has  generated \nabout  15%\u201320%  of  the  Government\u2019s  domestically  generated  revenues  (not  including  the \n$90 million generated in license fees). \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2003.

The  Afghan  mobile \ntelecom market saw 55% growth in 2007 alone, reaching 4 million subscribers by the end of the \nyear.  However,  about  45%  of  the  population  is yet  to  be  covered,  especially  outside  the  main \npopulation areas. Of the 366 districts in Afghanistan, Roshan currently has the highest levels of \ncoverage,  reaching  211.  All  the  urban  districts  are  covered.  The  155  remaining  districts  are \nmainly  rural  and  require  significant  additional  investment,  particularly  to  reach  the  more \ndispersed and underserved segments of Afghan society. Moreover, there is significant potential \nfor  growth  in  the  youth  and  female  segments,  which  are  being  strongly  targeted  by  Roshan.11  \n(Appendix 2 provides a summary of the telecom market.) \n \n13. \nSignificant Investment Requirements. The Government forecasts that penetration will \nreach  35%  by  2015.12 The  current  penetration  rate  of  12.4%  was  achieved  by  investment  of \naround  $1  billion  in  mobile  networks.  Based  on  these  statistics,  Roshan  estimates  that \ncontinued growth will require incremental investments in Afghanistan of about $200 million per \nyear as all operators continue to grow and expand into more costly rural areas.  \n \n14. \nCompetitive  Landscape. Given the demand for mobile telephones and the success of \nRoshan,  the  Government  tendered  two  new  licenses,  and  two  new  private  cellular  network \noperators  (Areeba/Investcom  and  Etisalat)  have  entered  the  market.  This  has  dramatically \nchanged the competitive landscape to the benefit of consumers. Currently, the market is served \nby  four  global  system  for  mobile  communications  (GSM)  network  operators  (Table  2).  After \nAfghan  Wireless  Communications  Company  (AWCC)  (November  2002)  and  Roshan  (January \n2003),  Areeba/Investcom  (subsequently  taken  over  by  the  South  Africa-based  MTN  Group) \nobtained  the  third  GSM  license  in  September  2005  and  launched  operations  in  July  2006. \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)-based and state-owned Etisalat13 obtained its license in May 2006 \nand launched in August 2007. Prepaid subscriptions, which constitute over 99% of  the mobile \nphones in the Afghan market today, ensure low entry barriers although high rollout costs provide \na relatively strong first-mover advantage.  \n \n\nTable 2: Comparison \n\nRoshan \nJanuary 2003 \n$5 million \nJuly 2003 \n54% \n6% \n33 provinces \n\nAWCC \nNovember 2001 \n$3.5 million \nApril 2002 \n46% \n3.2% \n33 provinces \n\nMTN/Areeba \nSeptember 2005 \n$40 million \nJuly 2006 \n42% \n3.5% \n25 provinces \n\n \nItem \nLicense  \nLicense Fee \nCommercial Launch \nCovered Population \nPenetration \nPresence \nAWCC = Afghan Wireless Communications Company  \nSource: Roshan.

Due to its better coverage, better quality of calls, price competitiveness, \nand  capacity  to  deliver  a  wide  range  of  services,  Roshan  leads  the  market  with over  40% \nmarket  share,  equaling over 1.8  million  subscribers  (end  of  2007).   Roshan  commands  a  12% \n                                                 \n11 Roshan plans to introduce two new products, \u201cyouth and students package\u201d and \u201cwomen and family package\u201d. The \nformer provides SMS and internet on a handset with lower rates, and the latter is intended to promote freedom and \nindependence but will be provided under a family bundle preprogrammed to make calls within the family as a start. \n\nEtisalat \nMay 2006 \n$40 million \nAugust 2007 \n16% \n0.1% \n11 provinces \n\n12 Ministry of Communications. 2007. Annual Report. Kabul.  \n13 The Ministry of Communications conducted a competitive bidding process for two national GSM licenses in 2005. \nInvestcom  and  Watan  Telecom,  an  Afghan  telecommunications  service  provider,  were  awarded  the  licenses  but \nWatan Telecom was unable to raise the license fee. Etisalat subsequently negotiated the acquisition of the fourth \nnational  GSM  license  in  May  2006.  There  was  considerable  industry  speculation  that  Etisalat  had  expressed  an \nintention to purchase a stake in Afghan Telecom, the government-owned fixed-line and fixed-wireless operator.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\n  \n\nmarket share lead over its nearest competitor, which is significant considering the following: (i) it \nis easier for newer entrants to set up communication towers as Roshan had paved the way; and \n(ii)  Roshan  has  positioned  itself  as  the  quality  telecommunications  provider,  not  the  cheapest \nproduct provider. Roshan\u2019s focus on the development and reconstruction of Afghanistan makes \nit the best positioned operator to continue to extend coverage beyond the major cities into rural \nareas with less population density and with less profit potential. \n \n16.  Market  Evolution.  Market  growth  in  2007  was  driven  by  high  demand,  increased \ncompetition, and dramatic declines in both tariffs and SIM prices. The two new entrants came \ninto  the  market  with  very  aggressive  strategies  for  market  penetration  that  brought  intense \ncompetition  and  eroded  earnings  for  all  operators.  Subsequently,  Etisalat  announced  in  May \nthat it will double its price. Such signs of market corrections are encouraging and the operators\u2019 \nability to quickly respond to market dynamics are becoming increasingly important. Because of \nfierce  competition,  and  operators  aiming  to  achieve  economies  of  scale,  the  price  of  the \nsubscriber identity module (SIM) card has fallen since early 2003 from $129 per SIM to as low \nas $2 per SIM in early 2008. Further, the introduction of per second billing by MTN/Areeba and \nsubsequently Roshan, has made users more price-sensitive and less loyal. More than a quarter \nof  users  have  multiple  SIMs, 14  making  market  share  less  relevant  in  gauging  profitability \nbetween  operators.  Moreover,  the  rate  of  multiple  SIM  users  in  the  market  has  increased \nsignificantly, shifting the battle to wallet share rather than merely market share. Roshan\u2019s share \nof revenue is about 5 percentage points higher than its market share at about 46%, indicating \nan  even  wider  lead  over  its  competitors.  Moreover,  with  the  comparative  advantage  of  better \nmarket  knowledge,  Roshan  is  focused  on  maintaining  market  leadership.  Value-added  \u201ckiller \napplications\u201d such as M-Paisa, which aims to capture more wallet share, are being launched to \ncontinue to drive market growth and ensure Roshan\u2019s leadership position.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulatory Environment  \n\n17. \nLiberalization  and  Privatization  Efforts  by  the  Government.  Since  late  2002,  the \nMinistry  of  Communications  (MOC)  has  largely  succeeded  in  the  implementation  of  an \naggressive  program  of  sector  liberalization,  reform,  and  legal  and  regulatory  framework \ndevelopment.  After  AWCC15 and  Roshan,  two  GSM  licenses  were  awarded  in  a  short  span  of \ntime  (October  2005  and  May  2006).  The  Arreba/Investcom  and  Etisalat  licenses  raised \n$40 million each for the Government.  \n\n \n18. \nPrivatization  of  Afghan  Telecom.  In  a  further  move  of  liberalization,  MOC  recently \ncommenced the process to dispose of an 80% shareholding in Afghan Telecom.16 As the holder \nof  a  unified  license,  Afghan  Telecom  is  permitted  to  offer  its  customers  any  range  of  services \n(voice,  data,  and  3G).17 Fierce  market  competition  has  taken  place  since  the  entry  of  the  last \ntwo participants.  \n \n Implementation  of  the  Telecom  Law.  In  December  2005,  the  Telecom  Services \n19. \nRegulation Act of Afghanistan (Telecom Law) was enacted. It provided for the formal regulation \n                                                 \n14 Largely  because  of  SIM  price  drops  (75%  in  2007),  network,  and  coverage-related  issues.  Roshan  offers  three \ntypes of SIMs (business user, average user, and low-income grade user) while others only offer one type of SIM.  \n\n15  Some 20% is owned by MOC. \n16 Afghan Telecom operates (i) a legacy fixed and digital fixed line network, which is estimated to have no more than \n50,000\u201380,000  phone  lines  across  the  country;  and  (ii)  a  code  division  multiple  access  (CDMA)  network,  which \nmay  be  operated  on  a  mobile  basis.  It  will  own  a  fiber  optic  cable  ring  that  will  eventually  link  the  main  cities  in \nAfghanistan.  The  completion  of  the  ring,  which  is  being  built  by  Zhong  Xing  Telecommunication  Equipment \nCompany Limited on a turnkey basis, is delayed but is nonetheless expected to be completed in 2010\u20142011.  \n\n17 Third generation mobile communication, which is capable of providing higher data transfer rates and services such \n\nas high-resolution video and multimedia services through spectral efficiency. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n  \n\nthe  creation  of \n\nof  the  sector  and  codified  the  role  and  authority  of  ATRA,  the  quasi-independent  sector \nregulator.18 The Telecom Law, together with the Private Investment Law, 2005, and the Income \nTax Law, 2005, offered a higher level of predictability.  \n \nTelephony  Operators  Association.  In an effort to address sector-wide issues from an \n20. \nindustry  standpoint,  Roshan  spearheaded \nthe  Telephony  Operators \nAssociation19  among the operators earlier this year. Parliament is currently reviewing the law. \nLicensees  have  jointly  submitted  proposed  amendments  to  the  law  and  have  held  several \nmeetings with the parliamentary subcommittees responsible for telecommunications to lobby for \nthe  amendments.  Roshan  has  worked  hard  to  develop  a  close  working  relationship  with  the \nparliamentary  telecommunications  subcommittees.  Strategically,  the  subcommittees  are  an \neffective check on potentially arbitrary decision making and actions within ATRA and MOC\u2014this \nis particularly important given the lack of an effective ability to appeal ATRA decisions, although \nsome developments are made by creating a forum  within DAB to address dispute resolutions. \nADB  is  assisting  through  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  many  of  these  sector-wide  issues \nand  will  continue  to  press  for  fair  and  independent  regulation  and  tax  treatment.  Generally, \nissues  are  being  resolved  and  progress  is  being  made,  but  guidance  needs  to  be  provided \nconsistently.  \n \nD. \n\nADB Operations in the Country and Sector \n\n1. \n\nIn Afghanistan  \n\n \n21. \nADB  Support.  Since  the  resumption  of  its  activities  in  Afghanistan  in  2002  through  to \nthe  end  of  2007,  ADB  had  approved  nearly  $1.3  billion  in  loans,  grants,  technical  assistance, \nand  private  sector  investments  to  support  Afghanistan\u2019s  development;  and  is  administering  a \nfurther $133.4  million in funding agency-financed or cost-shared activities, including assistance \nthrough the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. Appendix 3 provides further detail.  \n \nADB Activities. ADB funds have helped rebuild important road and power infrastructure \n22. \nand  irrigation  systems  in  northern  Afghanistan,  and  have  promoted  agricultural  growth  and \npoverty reduction by contributing to the development of a sound policy framework and efficient \nsector  institutions.  At  the  2006  London  Conference  on  Afghanistan,  ADB  pledged  to  consider \nassistance of about $1 billion over 2006\u20132010. ADB\u2019s projects are on track, although contract \nawards and disbursements are lagging because of weak government capacity and poor security. \nAt the 2008 Paris International Conference in Support of Afghanistan, ADB pledged up to $1.3 \nbillion  assistance  over  the  2008\u20132012  ADF  X  period,  subject  to  overall  availability  of  ADF  X \nfunding and country performance. This assistance would include loan and equity investments of \nup to $100 million in partnership with local and foreign investors, and guarantees of about $100 \nmillion to catalyze private investments. \n \n \n\n2. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n23. \nSector  Strategy.  While  more  modest  than  that  of  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \ninstitutions, ADB\u2019s role in the information and communication sector is to (i) support the private \nsector,  which  is  expected  to  lead  in  developing  information  technology  (IT)  networks; \n(ii) encourage  governments  to  create  a  predictable,  transparent,  and  nondiscriminatory  policy \nand regulatory environment; and (iii) ensure that IT-related rules and practices are responsive to \n                                                 \n18 Prior to enactment of the law, an ad hoc body\u2014the telecommunications regulatory board\u2014had been established \n\nby presidential decree to regulate the sector.  \n\n19 The association is being registered with the Ministry of Justice prior to a formal press announcement.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\n  \n\nthe  emerging  revolutionary  changes  in  the  way  people  conduct  business  using  IT.20 To  date, \nADB  has  made  private  sector  loans  to  telecommunications  companies  in  Afghanistan, \nBangladesh, India and the Philippines. Appendix 4 provides further details.  \n \nE. \n\nCorporate Overview of Roshan \n\n1. \n\nCorporate History  \n\n \n24. \nRemarkable Track Record. Roshan has had significant commercial success as market \nleader.  It  easily  overtook  the  first  entrant  and  has  climbed  to  and  remained  the  leader  by \ncapitalizing on its comparative advantages of highly qualified staff and in-depth understanding of \nthe market, a reputation for quality of service, greater national coverage, innovative marketing, \nand being a first mover in new business and services. Roshan is expected to continue to be the \nfrontrunner in the Afghan telecom market, with one of the most recognized brand names in the \ncountry. It has outperformed its own expansion plans consistently, reaching subscriber targets \nmuch faster than anticipated. Table 3 gives an overview of Roshan\u2019s corporate development.  \n\n \n\nTable 3: Roshan Summary Operational History \n\nEvent \n\nDate \nJan 2003 \nJan 2003 \nJul 2003 \nDec 2003 \nJan 2004 \nDec 2004 \nJun 2005 \nDec 2005 \nOct 2006 \nDec 2006 \nDec 2007 \nGSM = global system for mobile communications. \nSource: Roshan. \n \n\nTelecom Development Company Afghanistan established  \nAwarded a 15-year nationwide GSM license following an international license tender \nLaunched commercial services in Kabul \nReported 49,779 subscribers  \nOffered commercial services in Herat, Jalalabad, Kunduz, Mazar-e-Sharif \nReported 313,192 subscribers across 25 cities \nReached 500,000 subscribers \nReported 716,832 subscribers across 42 cities \nReached 1,000,000 subscribers \n1,066,676 subscribers in 145 cities and 31 provinces across the country \n1,644,456 subscribers in 207 cities and 32 provinces across the country \n\n2. \n \n\nOwnership and Management \n\n25. \nAga  Khan  Fund  for  Economic  Development\u2014Aga  Khan  Development  Network. \nThe  majority  shareholder  (51%  stake)  is  AKFED,  the  economic  development  arm  of  the  Aga \nKhan  Development  Network  (AKDN),  a  group  of  private,  nondenominational  development \nagencies  seeking  to  improve  opportunities  and  living  conditions  in  specific  regions  of  the \ndeveloping  world,  especially  Africa  and  Asia.  AKFED  also  owns  a  minority  in  a  GSM  mobile \ncommunications venture in neighboring Tajikistan. On 30 January 2008, AKDN and ADB signed \nan  agreement  aimed  at  expanding  the  partnership  between  the  two  institutions  with  a  private \nsector  focus.

Monaco Telecom International and TeliaSonera. MTI, indirectly controlled by Cable & \nWireless  PLC,  holds  36.75%,  and  TeliaSonera  UTA  owns  the  remaining  12.25%,  which  was \nacquired  in  July  2007  from  MCT  Corporation  (MCT),  a  US-based  provider  of  mobile \ntelecommunications to Central Asia and the Russian Federation. Both these shareholders have \nextensive telecommunications expertise that they are extending to Roshan and this essentially \nrepresents  a  further  strengthening  in  the  sponsor  profile  since  phases  I  and  II.  Appendix  5 \ncontains more details on the shareholders. \n \n27. \nCore  Management  Team.  The  core  management  team  has  been  in  place  since \ncommencement  of  operations.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  Roshan\u2019s  management  over  the \nlast  4  years  and  regards  it  as  a  highly  competent  and  value-adding  partner.  Roshan  focused \nheavily on strengthening the senior management in 2007, adding a new chief technology officer \nand chief customer officer in Q4 of 2007 and a new chief marketing officer in early 2008, all of \nwhom  have  extensive  experience  in  growing  GSM  operations  from  the  1 million  subscriber  to \n5 million  subscriber  level,  which  is  the  growth  Roshan  is  preparing  for.  Appendix  6  gives  brief \nbiographies of Roshan\u2019s management team.  \n \n\nStrategy Implementation  \n\n28. \nPrinciples for Comparative Advantage. Roshan\u2019s strategy implementation builds on a \nnumber of principles through which Roshan derives significant competitive advantage. The key \nthrusts  are  (i)  rapid  network  rollout  and  extensive  coverage,  (ii)  premium  quality  provider, \n(iii) innovative marketing approach, (iv) strong shareholder support, and (v) social development. \nAppendix 6 also describes Roshan\u2019s strategies.    \n \n\nComparative Advantage \n\n3. \n \n\n4. \n \n\nCompetition.  The  Afghan  market  has  become  extremely  competitive  in  the  last         \n\n29. \nCompetitor  Profiles.  Afghanistan  has  four  mobile  telecom  service  providers:  Roshan, \nAWCC,  MTN  (previously  Areeba),  and  Etisalat  are  the  GSM  operators.  Separately,  Afghan \nTelecom  is  a  fixed  line  and  code  division  multiple  access  (CDMA)  player.  Three  local  fixed \nservice  provider  licenses  have  been  issued  for  regional  players  in  rural  areas.  Only  one  of \nthese\u2014Wasel  Telecom\u2014which  operates  in  rural  Balkh,  a  northern  province  bordering \nUzbekistan, is currently active and has had limited success to date.  \n \n30. \n18\u201324 months with the entrance of the third and fourth GSM operators. Virtually no other market \nin the world today has had four operators when market penetration was only around 10%. As a \nresult  of  the  increased  competition,  which  has  caused  significant  multiple-SIM  usage  (now  at \nabout  30%),  Roshan  has  shifted  its  strategy  to focus  on  revenue  share  and  share  of  wallet in \naddition to simply measuring market share.   \n \n31. \ncompetitive threats. It has the following competitive advantages: \n \n\nRoshan\u2019s  Comparative  Advantage.  Roshan\u2019s  strengths  will  enable  it  to  counter \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nhigh-quality network installed, \nwidest coverage, \nstrong market position, \nestablished distribution network, \nregional presence,  \nseasoned management and staff with Afghan operations experience, and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\n  \n\n(vii) \n\nan established name with by far the strongest brand awareness in Afghanistan.  \n\n \n \n32. \nQuality  and  Coverage.  Roshan  is  focused  on  its  reputation  for  having  a  high  level  of \nservice,  and  will  continue  to  focus  on  overall  network  quality  and  geographic  coverage  and \nimprove its international call quality via direct interconnections and international fiber-optic links. \nRoshan\u2019s technology upgrades will enable it to continue to provide premium quality service to its \nsubscribers. Roshan\u2019s social program is also seen as a key brand image differentiator.  \n \n\n5. \n \n\nSocial Impact and Program  \n\nIt \n\nin  33  provinces \n\nindirectly  employs  close \n\n33. \nLargest  Social  Impact.  Since  its  commercial  launch  in  July  2003,  Roshan  has  built  a \nnational  mobile  telephony  network  used  by  about  1.9  million  Afghan  subscribers  across \nto \nthroughout  Afghanistan. \n211 districts \n25,000 Afghans  through  its  network  of  contractors,  distributors,  and  resellers  and  support \nbusinesses. It is also the largest private employer, with some 940 staff members, and its total \ninvestments  in  Afghanistan  exceed  $330  million.  As  part  of  its  core  commercial  operations, \nRoshan  provides  English-language,  IT,  and  GSM  technology  courses,  as  well  as  general \nleadership and management courses to its staff and dealers.  \n \n34. \nLargest Single Taxpayer. Roshan has paid some $107 million in taxes and government \nfees  since  its  start  in  2003,  and  is  projecting  payment  of  some  $45  million  in  2008.  It \ncontributions make up some 6% of Afghanistan\u2019s total government budget, making it by far the \ncountry\u2019s largest taxpayer.22 \n \nLargest Community Impact. In addition to its core commercial operations, which bring \n35. \ninherent social benefits, Roshan has a strong market reputation and brand recognition thanks to \nits social development efforts. Roshan (based on its AKFED roots) has contributed significantly \nto  the  development  of  Afghanistan  through  a  wide  array  of  social  programs.  Roshan  devotes \nsome 1% of its revenue to funding such activities. In 2006, Roshan\u2019s board approved the formal \ncreation  of  the  social  programs  function.  Social  activities  are  focused  in  the  areas  of \nempowerment  (a  telemedicine  program  that  provides  medical  services  utilizing  telephony; \nestablishment  of  women\u2019s  public  call  offices  (PCOs);  school  construction;  and  distribution  of \neducational  toys  and  the  $100  laptop  computer\u2014Roshan  is  the  official  distributor  of  the  \u201cone \nlaptop  per  child\u201d  initiative  for  Afghanistan)  and  philanthropy  (soup  kitchens  providing  33,000 \nmeals per month; water wells catering up to 3,000 families; educational sponsorship supporting \n146 children;  and  welfare  funds  supporting  20  heart  surgeries  are  examples).  Moreover, \nRoshan involves its partners in its Social development activities, increasing the scope and reach \nof its projects.  Further description of Roshan\u2019s social programs is in Appendix 7. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\nKey  Features.  The  main  purpose  of  the  phase  III  financing  is  to  expand  Roshan\u2019s \n\n36. \nnetwork, both through new coveragIV.e in semi-urban and economically underserved rural areas, \nproviding  high-quality  network  coverage  and  telecommunications  capacity  to  these  areas,  and \nby  extending  the  network  and  adding  density23 to  existing  areas.  The  expanded  network  will \n\n                                                 \n22 A  percentage  of  Roshan\u2019s  revenues  is  reinvested  by  AKFED  into  social  and  economic  development  projects \n\nimplemented by AKDN in Afghanistan. \n\n23 Density refers to connectivity within a specific region.  \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n  \n\nenable Roshan to continue with the rollout of PCOs as well as to extend its new mobile money \ntransfer  product,  M-Paisa,  nationwide.  Moreover,  technology  upgrades  and  replacements  that \nallow  for  a higher  quality,  more  cost-efficient  network  will enable  Roshan  to  drive down  prices \nand provide additional functionality to Afghan subscribers.  \n \n77. \nSemi-Urban  and  Rural  Expansion.  Market  penetration  is  projected  to  reach  20%  by \nthe  end  of  2008.  However,  current  penetration  is  concentrated  mainly  in  urban  areas,  and \npenetration  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas  remains  quite  low.  The  phase  III  expansion  Project \naims  to  expand  the  network,  deploying  a  synchronous  digital  hierarchy  fiber-optic  microwave \nring,  implementing  alternative  power  solutions  such  as  solar  power,  increasing  capacity  in \nexisting cities, and enhancing network redundancy.  \n \nBackbone.  Roshan  started  to  build  out  a  synchronous  digital  hierarchy  fiber-optic \n37. \nmicrowave backbone in 2005 to reduce the dependency on very small aperture satellite terminal \n(VSAT). The move from VSAT enables increased capacity to handle the high subscriber volume \nprojected  for  the  plan,  reduces  operating  expenses  by  reducing  dependency  on  expensive \nVSAT technology, and simplifies network maintenance\u2014enabling Roshan to drive down prices \nfor  Afghan  subscribers,  while  allowing  significant  improvements  in  quality  and  decreased \nlatency.24   \n \nRegional  Integration.  Currently,  Roshan  is  connected  with  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  and \n38. \nUAE  via  microwave  links  for  interconnecting  traffic  between  Roshan  subscribers  and \ninternational operators.  \n \n39.  M-Paisa\u2014Key  Features.  Another  key  feature  of  Roshan\u2019s  reengineering  is  its  full \nlaunch  of  M-Paisa.  This  is  a  powerful  product  in  a  country  where  more  people  own  mobile \nphones than have bank accounts\u2014about 97% of the Afghan population does not have access \nto  traditional  banking  infrastructure.  M-Paisa  will  permit  individuals  to  send  money  to  another \nmobile  user  (including  non-Roshan  customers),  receive  money  from  another  Roshan  mobile \ncustomer,  receive  and  repay  loans  from  microfinance  institutions,  purchase  Roshan  airtime, \nreceive  and  disburse  salaries,  and  pay  for  goods  and  services.  Currently,  there  are  no  other \ncompetitive  mobile  money  transfer  products  in  the  Afghan  market.  The  M-Paisa  product  will \nbring  the  following  benefits  to  Roshan:  (i)  increase  customer  loyalty  through  a  new  and \ninnovative  product;  (ii)  contribute  to  the  prime  SIM  effect  in  a  multiple-SIM  environment\u2014a \nproduct  such  as  M-Paisa  can  incentivize  users  to  keep  their  Roshan  SIM  in  their  phones; \n(iii) increase SMS usage; and (iv) decrease churn25\u2014experience from M-Pesa in Kenya (para. \n10) shows that it was a strong contributor to churn reduction.  \n \n \nB. \n\nOutcome  \n\nExpected  Results.

The  Project  aims  to  promote  inclusive  and  pro-poor \neconomic  growth  and  development  through  improved  and  widespread  telephone  connectivity, \nespecially  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas.  The  Project  will  cover  over  25  million  people  with \n5.5 million subscribers, 40% of which will be in semi-urban and rural areas. It will contribute in \nachieving the national objective of an overall penetration level of 35% by 2015 from the current \nlevel of 12.4%. \n \nimpact  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \n42. \ntelecommunications  industry  is  widely  recognized.  Roshan  is  considered  one  of  the  soundest \nprivate  sector  companies  in  Afghanistan,  contributing  substantially  to  the  Government\u2019s  tax \nrevenue income. Roshan\u2019s phase III expansion will further the development impacts witnessed \nin  the  earlier  phases,  with  expanded  economic  growth  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas.  The \nProject  will  cover  60  new  districts,  double  the  number  of  BTSs  to  1,490  with  50%  of  these  in \nnew districts, and increase telecommunications access for those who cannot afford mobiles by \ntripling  the  number  of  PCOs  to  6,850.  Mobile  telecommunications  will  improve  the  delivery  of \nservices such as health care, education, and security throughout the country. As was the case \nfor past expansions, the third phase will provide direct training, jobs, and business opportunities \nin underdeveloped areas to staff, dealers, and subcontractors. Further, the M-Paisa initiative will \nadd a new facet to the development impact by providing mobile money transfers and means for \nextending  microcredit  in  a  country  where  97%  of  the  population  does  not  have  access  to \nbanking. The M-Paisa service is expected to target 750,000 Afghans. Regional integration will \nimprove through new interconnectivity initiatives with the neighboring countries. The success of \nthis  Project  is  important  in  further  encouraging  a  nascent  private  sector  and  hesitant  foreign \ndirect investment to Afghanistan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\nin \n\nPrivate  Sector  Development.  The  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project  will  be \n43. \nassessed \nterms  of  private  sector  development,  business  success,  and  economic \nsustainability in accordance with the guidelines for implementing the good practice standards for \nevaluation of private sector investment operations prepared by the evaluation cooperation group \nof  multilateral  development  banks. 26  Implementation  of  the  Project  will  increase  Roshan\u2019s \ncapacity to implement and operate large-scale projects and to be a market leader in providing \ngood quality, competitively priced telecommunication services. In the telecommunications sector, \nit  will  set  high  benchmarks  and  standards,  promote  competition,  and  contribute  to  further \ndeveloping the regulatory capacity. At a broader level, success of the Project will have a strong \ndemonstration  effect  and  establish  the  viable  operation  of  private  sector  operations  in \nAfghanistan. This, in turn, will increase foreign direct investment in other sectors in the economy. \nThe Project is financially and economically sustainable and will have environmental benefits by \nreducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting the application of renewable energy options. \nThe Project\u2019s development effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n                                                 \n26 Multilateral  Development  Banks,  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group,  Working  Group  on  Private  Sector  Evaluation \n(WGPSE). 2006.

The  principal  agreement  underpinning  Roshan\u2019s  operations  is  the \noperating  license,  purchased  in  January  2003  for  $5  million.  The  license  gives  Roshan \nnonexclusive right to provide GSM mobile telephone services throughout Afghanistan as well as \nan  international  gateway.  The  main  terms  of  the  license  agreement  are  (i)  validity  through \nJanuary  2018,  renewable  for  an  additional  10  years;  (ii)  specific  radio  frequency  assignment \ngranted; (iii) approval granted to import equipment; (iv) ability to set and adjust tariffs with prior \npublic notice (with the exception of those deemed to have significant market power, which would \nhave  to  get  tariffs  approved  by  the  regulator);  and  (v)  provision  for  interconnection  with  other \noperators covering both domestic and international traffic.  \n \nOther  Arrangements.  Roshan  has  signed  agreements  with  Afghan  Telecom,  AWCC, \n45. \nMTN/Areeba, and Etisalat that are based on international market practices for interconnection. \nThe M-Paisa product will be operated out of Roshan\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, which will enter \ninto a managed service management agreement with Vodafone. Each party will allocate internal \noperating costs to the M-Paisa subsidiary and share equally in the net profit generated.  \n  \nF. \n\nProject Financing Plan \n\nDebt  Financing  Plan. Roshan aims to raise the $85 million in new debt, reduced from \n46. \nthe  initially  contemplated  $105  million  as  a  result  of  the  increase  in  non-external  financings  of \n$90  million  from  $70  million.  An  appropriate  gearing  ratio  will  be  maintained  for  the  company. \nWhile  still  under  discussion,  financing  participants  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  the  phase  II \nfinancing  (subject  to  market  appetite  and  recognizing  the  very  limited  market  interest  in \ncorporate financing in Afghanistan). The French development company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Promotion et \nde Participation pour la Coop\u00e9ration Economique (PROPARCO) is expected to participate. The \nGerman Investment and Development Company (DEG) is likely to participate.  \n \nG. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  positive  correlation  between  teledensity 27  and  economic  growth  has  been  well \n47. \ndocumented  for  a  considerable  period  through  a  number  of  empirical  studies.  In  a  typical \ndeveloping country, an increase in mobile penetration of 10% boosts GDP growth by around 1 \npercentage point.28 In Afghanistan, this impact on growth would be larger given the absence of \nother  means  of  communications  and  the  nonexistent  teledensity  outside  larger  urban  areas. \nSignificant opportunities exist for accelerating economic growth through additional investments \nin the telecommunication sector. \n \n48. \nThe  Project  involves  setting  up  BTSs  and  PCOs  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas,  with  a \nview to increasing coverage of mobile services in areas that are currently experiencing low or no \nconnectivity. The Project will further facilitate extension of microcredit services to people through \nthe cellular network in these remote areas, including non-Roshan subscribers. This will result in \nimproved  information  flow,  broadened  markets  for  goods  and  services,  enhanced  economic \nactivities of SMEs, substitute for physical travel and transport, and reduced transaction costs.  \n \n49. \nThe Project also reduces the costs of mobile services, improves the quality of services, \nand increases regional connectivity. Lower costs and better quality will translate to lower tariffs, \nan increase in affordability, and more usage of mobile services. This and the related microcredit \n\n                                                 \n27 Teledensity is defined as the number of telephones per 100 people.  \n28 The Economist. 2008. Mobile Telecoms Halfway There. 31 May.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\n  \n\nservices to be provided by the Project will have a multiplier effect on the economic benefits from \nthe Project. In the project design, the energy requirements of 15% of its operations will be based \non  solar  energy\u2014thereby  reducing  consumption  of  diesel  and  the  resultant  emissions  of \ngreenhouse gases. The scale of operations will generate employment for 6,500 people directly \nand indirectly. The Project will therefore yield multiple economic and environmental benefits to \nthe  country,  although  such  benefits  may  not  be  precisely  measurable  through  quantitative \neconomic analysis.  \n \nH. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nRoshan\u2019s  annual  accounts  are  audited  by  KPMG  Afghanistan.  As  a  private  company, \nRoshan is not obliged to disclose its financial statements to the public. Roshan follows standard \nADB reporting requirements for its existing loan, and will continue to do so for this loan. \n \nI. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nAs required under the existing loan, Roshan will continue to provide quarterly expansion \n51. \nreports,  detailing  the  growth  in  subscribers,  BTSs,  and  network  coverage  rollout.29 ADB  will \nmonitor  the  expansion  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  business  plan.  Evaluation  of  the  Project  will  be  based  on \nthree  levels:  (i)  the  success  of  the  Project  itself,  (ii)  development  of  the  telecommunications \nsector  in  general,  and  (iii)  private  sector  development.  Appendix  1  contains  the  development \nimpact and performance monitoring framework, including relevant performance indicators. \n \nJ. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  regularly  in  accordance  with  standard  ADB  portfolio \n52. \nmanagement and project evaluation practice, in conjunction with two previous phase financings.  \n \nK. \n\nEnvironmental and Other Safeguard Policy Aspects  \n\n53. \nThe environment category for Roshan phase III expansion project is C, following the two \nearlier project phases that were assigned the same classification. The expansion program will \ninvolve construction of over 700 additional BTSs, built both on buildings and ground-based sites \nwith  an  area  of  about  144  square  meters.  About  5,000  PCOs  will  be  established  in  existing \nshops  and  facilities.  Because  of  the  limited  construction  activities  associated  with  the  Project, \nthere will be no negative environmental impact.  \n \nThe  two  previous  phases  did  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous \n54. \npeople impacts. The phase III expansion project is category C, as there are no requirements for \ninvoluntary resettlement and no specific impacts on indigenous peoples. All sites will be leased, \nas Roshan does not purchase land. Roshan\u2019s site selection criteria are defined well\u2014BTSs are \non  leased  unused  lands  in  urban  areas  and  sparsely  populated  unproductive  desert  lands  in \nrural  areas.  No  sites  will  be  selected  that  (i)  are  adjacent  to  or  within  any  environmentally \nsensitive areas and sites of cultural and historical importance, (ii) require relocation of housing, \nand  (iii)  displace  non-titled  informal  settlers  or economic  users  of  the  land.  Generally,  Roshan \nprefers to lease vacant government-owned land. If private property is leased, the site selection \nwill depend on the property owners\u2019 willingness to lease the land and accept a negotiated rental \nprice at prevailing market rates.  \n \n\n                                                 \n29 Linklaters. 2005.

Information Undertaking. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe environmental and social due diligence assessments has confirmed that procedures \n55. \non  site  selection,  BTS  construction,  and  waste  management  have  been  satisfactorily \nimplemented  by  Roshan  in  the  earlier  project  phases.  The  company  has  also  designated \nspecific  offices  departments  (e.g.,  facilities,  deployment,  security  and  human  resource \ndepartments)  responsible  for  the  workplace  and  employees\u2019  health  and  safety.  Roshan  has  a \ncorporate social responsibility program, with about 1% of its revenue allocated to funding social \nactivities focused on three key areas\u2014philanthropy, social business development opportunities, \nand empowerment initiatives. Its social program interventions include provision of opportunities \nfor  development  of  SMEs,  educational  sponsorships,  welfare  funds,  telemedicine  programs, \nwater  wells,  soup  kitchens,  women\u2019s  PCOs,  e-learning  centers,  schools  and  children\u2019s \nplaygrounds, among others.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\nDevelopment Impact\u2014Track Record. ADB was first approached by AKFED, Roshan\u2019s \n56. \nmajority  shareholder,  and  Roshan  in  early  2004  for  financing  of  Roshan\u2019s  phase  I  network \nexpansion.  The  project  proved  successful  and  was  followed  with  the  phase  II  expansion, \napproved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in June 2007. The justifications for assisting the phase III \nProject  continue  to  be  manifold.  The  developmental  impact  of  mobile  telephony,  the  technical \nand  financial  sustainability  of  the  business  model,  the  economic  and  social  benefits  of  the \nProject  including  environmental  sustainability,  with  the  unmet  need  for  medium-term  finance \nfrom  the  commercial  market,  its  role  in  advancing  regulatory  reform,  and  its  full  compatibility \nwith ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update ,30 are all compelling.  \n \n57. \nRationale  for  Supporting  the  Phase  III\u2014Rural  Development.  Roshan  requires \n$85 million in debt, reduced from its original $105 million, for its business plan to be fully funded. \nIn  the  dynamic  Afghan  telecom  market,  and  with  the  importance  of  quickly  spurring \nreconstruction  efforts  in  Afghanistan,  the  proposed  additional  financing  has  very  significant \ndevelopment  impacts.  It  will  help  address  unmet  demand,  especially  in  semi-urban  and  rural \nareas  where  reconstruction  efforts  have  been  most  limited.  Without  the  phase  III  funding,  not \nonly Roshan\u2019s pace of expansion but also the country\u2019s pace of reconstruction will be impacted. \nThere are no commercial sources of financing that can substitute ADB funding. \n \nB. \n\nNature and Amount \n\nADB\u2019s proposed financial assistance is expected to be a term loan of up to $60 million \n\n58. \nwithout government guarantee.  \n \nC. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\n59. \nThe  loan  terms  will  be  largely  similar  to  the  phase  II  financing,  with  subordination  of \nrelated party transactions as needed. The phase III financing will take into account (to the extent \nreasonable  and  not  compromising  the  position  of  the  senior  lenders)  Roshan\u2019s  debt  service \ntrack record to date, its evolution as a leading corporation in Afghanistan, and dynamic market \nconditions  of  the  still  nascent  telecom  market.  After  the  expansion  financing,  Roshan  will \ncontinue  to  have  a  conservative  gearing  ratio.  ADB\u2019s  fees  and  premium  for  this  political  risk \ncover  will  be  market-driven  and  as  determined  by  ADB\u2019s  Pricing  and  Credit  Enhancement \nCommittee. \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Afghanistan. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n 15\n\n  \n\nValue-Added by ADB \n\nADB will add value through the following measures: \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n  \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCatalyzing investment. Without secure, medium-term financing, mobile network \nexpansion in Afghanistan will be constrained. This will hinder the development of \na  thriving  sector  that  is  the  main  driver  of  private  sector  development  in \nAfghanistan. There is no functioning local debt market, and offshore commercial \nand export credit debt sources are largely not interested in extending uncovered \nfinancing to businesses in Afghanistan. However, ADB\u2019s involvement can act as \na  catalyst,  as  it  did  in  the  previous  expansion  financings,  to  encourage  other \nlenders to participate in the phase III financing. \nPromote  private  sector  development.  The  demonstration  effect  of  the \ncontinued support  to  a well-capitalized  private sector-led, Afghan  reconstruction \neffort success story (of which there are not many) will encourage entrepreneurs \nand  financial  investors  to  consider  investments  in  key  sectors  in  Afghanistan.  It \nalso  assists  the  Government  in  identifying  the  regulatory  and  legislative  areas \nthat  need  improvement  in  promoting  much-needed  private  sector  development. \nThe  benefits  of  well-regulated  market  competition  also  provide  important \nexamples for other areas of the economy.  \nDialogue  with  the  Government.  ADB  adds  value  in  engaging  with  the \nGovernment  and  other  stakeholders,  and \nissues  perceived  as \nimpediments to growth of the sector and the economy.  \nCooperation.

ADB\u2019s  approach  to  reconstruction  of  Afghanistan  is \n(i) building  capacity,  (ii)  establishing  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  frameworks,  and \n(iii) rehabilitating  essential  infrastructure.  The  Project,  which  aims  to  expand  the  mobile \ncommunications  network  nationwide,  is  anchored  in  the  third  point.  The  telecommunication \nsector  has  led  private  sector  development  of  Afghanistan  and  is  helping  build  capacity  and \nestablish policy and institutional frameworks to promote further economic growth.  \n \n62. \nThe  phase  III  Project\u2019s  focus  on  expanding  into  semi-urban  and  rural  areas  further \nsupports inclusive economic growth, \u201creducing rising inequalities in incomes in different regions \nas  well  as  gaps  between  urban  and  rural  areas\u201d.  Regional  integration  via  interconnection \nagreements with operators in neighboring countries is also in line with the thrust of the country \nstrategy and program update. Further, the update states explicitly that no change is anticipated \nin  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  the  telecommunications  sector  (via  the  existing  loan  to  Roshan,  and \nalso \nfor  energy,  mining,  and \ntelecommunications) as \u201cADB\u2019s\u2026private sector support to the\u2026telecommunications sectors\u2026\u201d \nis \u201chighly appreciated\u201d by the Government.  \n \n\nthrough  ADB\u2019s  membership \n\nthe  consultative  group \n\nin \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n  \n\nNo Negative Impact. Roshan\u2019s construction works have virtually no negative impact on \n63. \nthe  environment.  The  environmental  category  of  the  phase  I  and  II  projects  was  C,  and  will \nremain  C  for  phase  III.  There  will  be  minimal  cable  construction  and  masts  will  be  located  on \nexisting buildings or in open fields. Neither the original construction nor the expansion will result \nin any resettlement, and the Project will be classified resettlement category C. The Project is not \nforeseen  to  have  any  negative  impact  on  indigenous  peoples,  and  is  consequently  classified \ncategory C. All categorizations remain unchanged from phases I and II. \n\n \n\nF. \n\nInvestment Limits \n\n64. \nThe  proposed  investment,  ADB\u2019s  seventh  nonsovereign  investment  in  Afghanistan, \nwould,  if  approved  by  the  Board,  represent  1.1%  of  ADB\u2019s  total  expected  nonsovereign \nexposure,31 and  increase  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  exposure  (i)  in  Afghanistan  from  1.6%  to  2.7% \ntotal  exposure,  and  (ii)  in  the  telecommunications  and  communications  sector  from  4.3%  to \n5.4%  total  exposure.  ADB\u2019s  exposure  to  Roshan  would  increase  from  $63.8  million  to  (up  to) \n$123.8 million. Outstanding loans of $63.8 million represents 24.6% of Roshan\u2019s total assets as \nat  2007.  Based  on  Roshan\u2019s  financing  plan,  ADB\u2019s  exposure  may  exceed  25%  of  total  assets \nboth before and at the time the ADB loan has been fully disbursed should operational cashflows \nbe  lower  than  anticipated,  or  loans  from  other  lenders  are  disbursed  later  than  expected. \nManagement  will  therefore  seek  a  waiver  from  the  Board  with  respect  to  the  single  exposure \nlimit under ADB\u2019s policy on prudential limits,32 ADB\u2019s Risk Management Unit (RMU) has noted \nthat no new shareholder equity has been committed by Roshan\u2019s owners, and accordingly, that \nADB\u2019s  exposure  may  exceed  25%  of  total  capitalization  if  losses  continue.  RMU  supports  the \nrequest for a waiver based on Roshan\u2019s strong franchise and market position, a well-established \nrelation  with  the  majority  owner  and  a  reasonable  business  plan.  The  proposed  investment  is \nwithin  approved  aggregate,  country,  and  industry  exposure  limits  for  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign \noperations. \n \nG. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n65. \nRoshan  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003).  Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB\u2019s  current \ninvestment documentation with Roshan requires Roshan to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and \ncovenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation \nbetween  ADB  and  Roshan  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential \nviolation  of  these  undertakings.  M-Paisa  is  regulated  under  DAB  as  a  money  service  provider \nand its anti-money-laundering procedures have been approved by DAB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n66. \nNo-Objection Letter. Consistent with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Charter, ADB will obtain a \nno-objection letter from  the Government with respect to the proposed loan before any funding \nunder the loan is disbursed. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n31  Expected  nonsovereign  exposure  is  defined  as  Board-approved  and  effective  transactions  (outstanding  + \nundisbursed  commitments)  plus  Board-approved  but  not  yet  effective  transactions.  An  amount  is  considered \ncommitted when there are signed legal agreements. Total exposures are as of 2 June 2008. \n\n32 ADB. 2007. Doc. R54-2007.

\n\nIn  November  2002,  1  year  following  the  fall  of  the  Taliban,  mobile  penetration  in \n1. \nAfghanistan  was  estimated  at  roughly  0.01%,  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world.  The  Ministry  of \nCommunications (MOC) reported only 33,000 lines in service in the country\u2019s major cities, while \nlines in provincial and rural areas had not been considered as so few were working. As a result \nof  a  complete  lack  of  investment  in  fixed-line  telephony  since  the  Soviet  occupation  in  1979, \nAfghanistan\u2019s existing infrastructure was either neglected through lack of funding or damaged in \nthe armed conflict that spanned nearly 26 years. The capital, Kabul, was estimated to have just \n20,150 fixed lines in the late 1990s, serving over 2 million people, with most calls dialed being \neither dropped or never connected. \n \nIn  an  investment  climate  survey  in  2005, 34 most  of  the  surveyed  firms  mentioned \n2. \ntelecommunications as a major or severe problem. Afghanistan\u2019s mobile penetration35 in 2007 is \ncurrently estimated to be about 12%.   \n \nB. \n\nSector Policy and Regulatory Environment \n\nThe  Law  for  Regulation  of  Telecommunication  Services  (the  Telecom  Law)  was \n3. \npromulgated  in  December  2005  and  a  regulatory  board,  the  Afghanistan  Telecommunications \nRegulatory Authority (ATRA), was set up.   \n \nThere  remains  an  access  agenda  for  rural  areas,  a  need  to  improve  the  quality  and \n4. \nrange of services considerably, and to reduce prices further. Nonetheless, progress to date has \nbeen  remarkable.  The  Telecom  Development  Fund  was  meant  to  play  a  role  in  this  area,  but \nlimited progress has been seen to date. \n \n5. \nOver  the  past  7  years,  as  the  telecommunications  sector  has  continued  to  develop, \ntelecommunications revenues have grown to become a significant portion of the Government\u2019s \nbudget.36  \n\n \n\n6. \nToday, the main objective of government policy for communications is to modernize and \nrapidly expand telecommunications networks and services, and to achieve universal access to \ntelephony  across  the  country.  The  Government  is  also  focusing  on  information  and \ncommunication  technologies,  seeking  to  create  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  groups,  and \ninvesting  in  developing  such  opportunities.  The  Government  recognizes  the  significance  of \ncreating  the  right  conditions  for  open  competition  and  private  sector  investment  by  ensuring  a \nstable and transparent policy, legal, and regulatory environment.  \n \n\n                                                 \n33  This  section  is  largely  based  on  World  Bank.  2005.  The  Investment  Climate  in  Afghanistan\u2014Exploiting \nOpportunities  in  an  Uncertain  Environment.  Washington,  DC  (December);  and  M.N.  Naseri.  2005.  Afghanistan \nCountry Report\u2014Telecommunications. Kabul (November). \n\n34 World Bank. 2005. The Investment Climate in Afghanistan\u2014Exploiting Opportunities in an Uncertain Environment. \n\nWashington, DC (December). \n35 Telephones per 1,000 people. \n36  Roshan has been responsible for about 65% of the Government\u2019s entire telecoms revenues since its first year of \noperation,  and  is  the  single  largest  contributor  to  the  state  budget  through  a  variety  of  taxes,  having  contributed \n10% of the state budget in 2005. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n7. \n \n\n \nC. \n\nMOC\u2019s vision for the future focuses on the following scope of achievements: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nwide coverage of services in all cities, towns, and 5,000 villages; \nimproved quality, lower tariffs;  \ncompetitive environment with four global system for mobile communications  \n\n                  (GSM) operators;  \n\npenetrating 35% of the population in the next 5\u20137 years; \n50,000 jobs created in the next few years; \ncumulative investments in telecom over 1.5 billion in next 4 years; and \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  more importantly, government revenues from telecom in next 10 years should be \n\n$2 billion. \n\nFixed-Line Telephony Market \n\n8. \nIn  the  absence  of  any  national  telecommunications  operators,  MOC  took  over  the \noperation of the country\u2019s limited fixed-line infrastructure in 2001. It inherited two separate fixed-\nline  networks,  an  outdated  analog  system  dating  back  to  Soviet  rule,  and  a  newer  fiber-optic \nnetwork  used  by  the  Taliban.  Neither  network  extended  beyond  the  country\u2019s  borders  nor  did \nthey offer reliable interconnectivity. Hence, Afghanistan relied heavily on satellite connectivity for \ninternational  calls  and  limited  data  transmission,  as  well  as  for  most  domestic  long-distance \nservices.  \n \n9. \nAlthough no second fixed-line operator is licensed in Afghanistan, the regulator has set \naside  within  its  numbering  plan  the  possibility  of  two  further  licensees.  There  are  currently  no \nplans to award additional fixed-line licenses in Afghanistan. \n \nD. \n\nMobile Telephony Market \n\nDriven by a competitive market and several hundred million dollars in private investment, \n10. \nthe mobile footprint covers about half of the population. Table A2 describes the Afghan mobile \nmarket, based on estimates. \n\nTable A2: Afghan Mobile Market  \n(\u2018000) \n\nItem \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\nAfghan population \n(million) \nMobile penetration (%) \nRoshan subscribers \n\n23 \n\n0.7\n\n49 \n\n24 \n\n3.0 \n\n390 \n\n25 \n\n4.6 \n\n25 \n\n6.8 \n\n32 \n12.4 \n\n716 \n\n1,069 \n\n1,800 \n\nSources: TeleGeography,Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nFollowing  the  first  commercial  launch  in  Kabul  in  April  2002,  mobile  services  have \n\n \n11. \ndeveloped rapidly, reaching about 4 million subscribers by December 2007.  \n \n12. \nGiven the low penetration rate of 12% at the end of 2007, and the fact that 50% of the \npopulation are 15 years of age or younger, the prospects for market growth are significant. The \nyouth  and  female  segments  are  significantly  underpenetrated,  with  considerable  room  for \ncontinued growth. \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nConfidence  in  the  sector  has  resulted  in  significant  private  sector  investments,  most \n13. \nrecently evidenced in 2006 by the $40.1 million paid by Investcom and Etisalat for Afghanistan\u2019s \nthird and fourth mobile licenses.   \n \nE. \n\nMarket Structure \n\n14. \nThe  cellular  market  is  currently  served  by  four  private  cellular  network  operators\u2014\nRoshan, Afghan Wireless Communications Company (AWCC), MTN/Areeba, and Etisalat\u2014and \nthe state-run fixed-line operator Afghan Telecom.  \n \n15. \nAll GSM-providing companies offer national and international mobile calling, voice mail, \nnational and international SMS, and data services, on prepaid pricing plans. They also offer a \npostpaid  pricing  plan  to  corporations.  The  unreliability  of  the  postal  service  and  lack  of  retail \nbanking infrastructure remain a barrier to further development of this product.  \n \nF. \n\nInternet Communication \n\n16. \nThe  internet  has  become  one  of  the  most  efficient  ways  for  firms  to  communicate  and \nconduct business with distant clients. However, in Afghanistan, business use of the internet is \nnearly nonexistent outside of a few of the largest cities. On average, 15% of the surveyed firms \nregularly  use  e-mail  in  interactions  with  their  clients  and  suppliers,  and  9%  use  web  pages. \nThere is a distinct regional difference in the use of the internet. Almost a quarter of enterprises \nin  Kabul,  Herat,  and  Mazar-e-Sharif  reported  using  the  internet.  However,  in  Jalalabad  and \nKandahar, no firms reported using websites and only 6% of the sample in Kandahar used e-mail.   \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nADB ASSISTANCE FOR AFGHANISTAN

AKDN,  which  has  been  supporting  humanitarian  assistance  and \nrehabilitation in Afghanistan since 1996, works for the common good of all citizens, regardless \nof  their  gender,  origin,  or  religion.  Its  underlying  impulse  is  the  ethic  of  compassion  for  the \nvulnerable  in  society.  Its  programs  in  Afghanistan  come  under  a  comprehensive  development \nagreement signed by the Aga Khan and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.  \n \n4. \nFor more than 50 years, AKFED has made investments and operated companies in the \ndeveloping nations of Africa, South Asia, and Central Asia. AKFED seeks to create profitable, \nsustainable enterprises through long-term investments that result in strong equity positions. This \nin  turn  allows  AKFED  to  take  a  \u201chands-on\u201d  approach  by  providing  managerial  and  technical \nexpertise.  Profits  generated  by  the  fund  are  reinvested  in  other  economic  development \ninitiatives under the AKFED umbrella. \n \nAKFED often works in collaboration with local and international development partners to \n5. \ncreate  and  operate  companies  that  provide  goods  and  services  essential  to  economic \ndevelopment.  These  range  from  banking  to  electric  power,  agricultural  processing,  hotels, \nairlines,  and  telecommunications.  AKFED  also  works  with  governments  to  help  promote  the \ncreation of enabling legal and fiscal structures that encourage the growth of the private sector.  \n \n6. \nAt  the  invitation  of  several  governments,  AKFED  has  helped  critical  sectors  make  the \ntransition to market economies through privatization. These include banking, power generation, \ntourism,  manufacturing,  and  agriculture  in  countries  as  varied  as  Afghanistan,  Pakistan, \nTajikistan,  and  Uganda.  AKFED\u2019s  approach  emphasizes  the  development  of  local  human \nresources  over  time,  including  managerial,  technical,  marketing,  and  financial  skills.  Other \ncharacteristics  of  this  approach  include  providing  essential  seed  capital  to  launch  projects  in \nthose  sectors  and  countries  where  attracting  investment  is  difficult.  AKFED  takes  a  long-term \nview  to  build  viable,  self-sustaining,  and  profitable  companies.  It  also  participates  in  the \nmanagement of companies in which it invests, with the aim of preparing companies for broader \nownership by local interests. \n \n\na. \n\nFinancial Services  \n\n7. \nTo  encourage  the  creation  of  strong  and  efficient  capital  markets,  AKFED  provides  an \ninstitutional  umbrella  for  banks,  insurance  groups,  and  property-owning  and  management \ncompanies in eastern Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia.  \n \n8. \nAKFED\u2019s  investments  include  a  controlling  interest  in  Habib  Bank  Limited,  Pakistan\u2019s \nlargest  private  bank  (acquired  through  a  government  privatization  program  in  2004)  and  the \nDevelopment Credit Bank Limited in India. AKFED is also the founder and lead shareholder in \nthe Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank  which focuses on the corporate sector and on medium- \nand  long-term  finance  that  will  contribute  to  the  growth  of  the  banking  industry  and  stimulate \nentrepreneurial  activity.  In  Bangladesh,  AKFED  is  the  majority  owner  of  a  leading  provider  of \ncorporate finance and lending services to major businesses and projects.  \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nIts  holdings  in  East  Africa  include  the  Diamond  Trust  Bank,  which  was  founded  in  the \n9. \n1930s in Kenya to help recycle local savings into loans for home building and small businesses. \nIt  now  offers  a  range  of  retail  banking  products.  The  Jubilee  Insurance  Group  provides \ninsurance  across  the  region.  In  Pakistan,  New Jubilee  Insurance  and New  Jubilee  Life offer  a \nrange of products.  \n \n\nb. \n\nTourism Development  \n\nAKFED\u2019s  Tourism  Promotion  Services  seeks  to  develop  tourism  potential  in  selected \n10. \nareas  in  the  developing  world,  particularly  in  underserved  regions.  It  builds,  rehabilitates,  and \nmanages  hotels  and  lodges  that  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  the  overall  investment \nclimate in an environmentally and culturally sensitive manner.  \n \n11. \nAKFED  owns  and  manages  properties  in  Afghanistan,  Kenya,  Mozambique,  Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Tanzania, and Uganda, operating under the brand name Serena. Serena hotels and \nlodges  contribute  to  the  local  economy  by  training  skilled  labor,  reinvigoration  of  artisans  and \ncraft  industries,  and  sensitive  conservation  or  development  of  the  surrounding  area.  This \nincludes  prioritizing  hiring  and  training  of  local  residents  for  employment  at  all  levels  of  the \norganization.  \n \nTourism  Promotion  Services  often  seeks  to  develop  properties  in  less-traveled  areas \n12. \nthat require accommodation of an international standard\u2014accommodation that supports tourism \nand business development\u2014but which often are ignored by commercial hotel chains.  \n \nAt  each  hotel,  the  policy  is  to  minimize  the  impact  on  the  local  environment  while \n13. \nseeking  to  maximize  socioeconomic  benefits  to  the  local  economy.  In  Tanzania,  for  example, \nbefore  the  creation  of  new  facilities  in  the  country\u2019s  national  parks,  four  environmental  impact \nstudies were carried out. The Serena Hotel in Mombasa maintains a sanctuary for indigenous \nbutterflies and works with local residents on a program to protect sea turtle nesting sites. These \nmeasures have earned the Serena hotels numerous environmental awards.  \n \n\nc. \n\nIndustry  \n\n14. \nAKFED has invested in and manages over 50 industrial project companies in Africa and \nAsia. In the early 1960s, a group of companies was set up under the corporate name Industrial \nPromotion  Services  (IPS).  Each  company  was  created  to  provide  venture  capital,  technical \nassistance, and management support to encourage and expand private enterprise in countries \nof  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  South  Asia.  Growth,  privatization,  and  a  reorientation  away  from \nimport  substitution  and  toward  export  promotion  resulted  in  adjustments  to  IPS\u2019s  approach. \nExpansion into areas such as agribusiness, packaging, and infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa \nwas accompanied by the need for new investments in the emerging economies of Central Asia \nin  the  1990s  and  the  current  decade,  in  particular,  in  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan.  Today,  IPS \ncompanies play a vital role in local and regional economies.  \n \n\nd. \n\nFood and Agroprocessing  \n\n15. \nOne of IPS\u2019s core operational sectors, agroprocessing, includes companies that supply \ngoods  for  local  and  export  markets.  They  also  play  a  significant  role  in  supporting  the  rural \neconomy.  In  Kenya,  for  example,  Frigoken  provides  agricultural  extension  services  to \n25,000 Kenyan  bean  farmers.  The  beans  are  processed  and  exported  to  European  markets. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n45 \n\nIn  West  Africa,  AKFED  supplies  agricultural  extension  services \n\nLoans are provided to the farmers by the nonprofit Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance to assist \nthem with financial needs that arise before receiving harvest revenues.  \n \n16. \nthan \n45,000 cotton  farmers,  operates  cotton  ginneries,  and  exports  finished  products.  Its  social \nprograms offer microfinance, education, health, and sanitation to the farmers.  \n \n17. \nIn  addition  to  promoting  the  employment  of  women,  these  companies  have  become \nnational  role  models  in  matters  of  employee  welfare,  including  the  provision  of  child  care  and \nhealth care.  \n \n\nto  more \n\ne. \n\nInfrastructure  \n\n18. \nAKFED  works  with  governments,  international  corporations,  international  financial \ninstitutions, and funding agencies to create solutions to pressing infrastructure needs, including \npower generation, telecommunications, and water supply services. AKFED\u2019s first investment in \nthe  power  sector,  the  $225  million  Azito  energy  project  in  the  Ivory  Coast,  was  the  largest \nprivate  sector  power  plant  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  It  was  followed  by  the  Tsavo  power  plant  in \nMombasa,  Kenya\u2019s  first  privately  financed  \u201copen-bid\u201d  project  and  the  first  such  plant \nsuccessfully constructed under an updated and more stringent environmental law.  \n \n19. \nAKFED  is  also  working  with  partners  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  a  Soviet-era \nhydroelectric  power  plant  that  will  boost  the  eastern  province  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  inadequate \nelectricity  supply,  reduce  deforestation,  and  contribute  to  the  region\u2019s  economic  recovery.  In \nUganda,  AKFED  is  leading  the  $500  million,  220-megawatt  Bujagali  Hydro  Power  Project  to \nproduce critically needed electricity for the country, and for neighboring Kenya.  \n \n20. \nAKFED\u2019s initial involvement in building telecommunications infrastructure was in Indigo, \na  global  system  for  mobile  communications  (GSM)  mobile  phone  operation  in  Tajikistan. \nSubsequently,  AKFED  was  awarded  Afghanistan\u2019s  second  GSM  license  and  created  Roshan, \nwhich is today one of the largest employers in the country. AKFED is also a key partner in the \ndevelopment  of  Seacom,  a  submarine  cable  that  will  connect  countries  located  in  the  Eastern \npart of Africa to Europe. \n \n\nf. \n\nMedia Services  \n\nThe Nation Media Group, founded by the Aga Khan in 1960, has its origins in Kenya\u2019s \n21. \nTaifa  and  Nation  newspapers,  which  were  set  up  to  provide  independent  voices  during  the \nyears just before the country\u2019s independence. Majority-owned and run by Kenyans, the Nation \nMedia  Group\u2019s  operations  include  a  growing  number  of  English  and  Kiswahili  national \nnewspapers, a regional weekly, and radio and television stations. In recent years, the group has \nexpanded its operations into Uganda and Tanzania.  \n \n\ng. \n\nAviation Services  \n\n22. \nThe aim of the aviation division is to maintain the critical aviation infrastructure in support \nof  economic  development.  The  division  provides  investment,  management,  and  operational \nexpertise  and  training.  AKFED  has  taken  a  majority  stake  in  Air  Burkina,  as  part  of  a \ngovernment  privatization  plan  designed  to  ensure  the  long-term  viability  of  the  airline.  AKFED \nalso  launched  airlines  in  Mali  (2005)  and  in  Uganda  (2007)  to  increase  capacity  in  West  and \nEast Africa. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n  \n\n2. \n\nMonaco Telecom International \n\n23.  Monaco  Telecom  Group  holds  36.75%  of  Roshan  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary \nMonaco Telecom International (MTI).  \n \n24.  Monaco  Telecom  Group  was  created  in  1997  and  is  the  incumbent  operator  for  the \nPrincipality  of  Monaco.  The  group\u2019s  predecessor  was  the  principality's  administrative  service, \nthe Office Mon\u00e9gasque des T\u00e9l\u00e9phones. Monaco Telecom has an exclusive license to provide \ncustomers  in  Monaco  with  fixed  telephony  services,  digital  mobile  telephony  (GSM),  public \nnetwork  interconnect  services,  and  a  public  payphone  service;  the  group\u2019s  exclusivity  ends  in \n2023.  Today,  Monaco  Telecom  is  engaged  in  an  ongoing  major  capital  expenditure  program \ndesigned to ensure that its services remain competitive and that it can continue to meet all its \ncustomers\u2019  requirements.  The  focus  within  Monaco  is  on  quality  of  service  while  maintaining \npricing parity with neighboring countries.  \n \nOn  18  June  2004,  Cable  &  Wireless  acquired  55%  of  Monaco  Telecom  from \n25. \nVivendi Universal, for a total consideration of \u20ac162 million. Simultaneously with the acquisition, \nCable  &  Wireless  transferred  legal  ownership  of  6%  of  the  shares  of  Monaco  Telecom  to \nCompagnie  Mon\u00e9gasque  de  Banque,  an  unrelated  third  party.  Cable  &  Wireless  contractually \nretained  voting  and  economic  rights  in  the  shares  as  part  of  the  arrangement.  In  addition,  the \n6% interest is subject to certain put and call options that, together with the retained voting and \neconomic rights, provide full management control of Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless. \n \nCable & Wireless has also entered into a shareholders\u2019 agreement with Monaco, which \n26. \ncontains,  among  other  provisions,  a  prohibition  on  either  Cable  &  Wireless  or  the  principality \n(subject  to  certain  limited  exceptions)  selling  their  shares  in  Monaco  Telecom  for  5  years, \nmutual  preemption  rights  on  transfer  of  shares,  and  certain  other  limited  rights  in  favor  of  the \nprincipality. The principality has a put option entitling it to put its 45% shareholding in Monaco \nTelecom  to  Cable  &  Wireless  at  certain  times  after  1  January  2008.  The  exercise  price  under \nthe put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco \nTelecom. \n \n27. \nDuring the 12 months leading up to the year ending 31 March 2007, Monaco Telecom \ngenerated \u20ac201 million in revenues and \u20ac31 million in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) \nin operating profit. \n \n28.  Monaco  Telecom  is  developing  its  international  activities  in  network  management, \nsatellite  services,  and  wireless  broadband.  Through  MTI,  the  group  has  operations  in \nAfghanistan, Algeria, Kosovo, Tunisia, and West Africa.

As of April 2008, Roshan\u2019s network covered over 55% of \nthe  Afghan  population,  roughly  10%  more  than  its  nearest  competitor. \nCustomers list coverage as a key driver of using Roshan\u2019s network.  This \nis an advantage that Roshan would like to maintain. Importantly, Roshan\u2019s \nnetwork rollout has been rapid, with almost 800 base transceiver stations \non air today. \n \nRoshan\u2019s continued emphasis on quality has made it the strongest player \nin  the  Afghan  market.  The  recent  technology  swaps and  upgrades  in  the \nfirst  quarter  (Q1)  and  Q2  of  2008  will  enable  Roshan  to  maintain  its \npositioning at the forefront of quality and to ensure that Afghan subscribers \nreceive high-quality communications service. \n \nRoshan has developed a unique and differentiated brand and introduced a \nwide  range  of  service  innovations  to  the  Afghan  market.  These  are \ndesigned  to  maximize  the  value  and  appeal  of  Roshan\u2019s  services  to \nsubscribers  and  to  differentiate  Roshan  on  grounds  other  than  price. \nMoreover,  Roshan  has  been  aggressive  with \nintroduction  of \npromotions  in  the  market  that  seek  to  support  its  position  as  the  \u201cprime \nSIM\u201d  in  the  Afghan  market  today.  Distribution  and  customer  service  are \nalso  prioritized  within  Roshan\u2019s  marketing  strategy.  Roshan  has  won  a \nnumber of international awards for its brand, marketing, and customer care \nefforts. \n \nIn  implementing  its  strategy,  Roshan  has  greatly  benefited  from  the \nresources, market knowledge, and relationships of its three shareholders.  \n \nRoshan is dedicated to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and has specific \nresources dedicated to this purpose, serving as a benchmark for corporate \nsocial responsibility in Afghanistan. \n \n\nthe \n\n \n\nItem \n\nRapid Network Rollout and \nExtensive Coverage  \n \n\nPremium Quality Provider \n \n\nInnovative Marketing \nApproach \n \n\nStrong Shareholder \nSupport \n \nSocial Development \n \n\nSource: Roshan. \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nSUMMARY OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS \n\n \nPublic Call Office Program. Roshan has some 2,500 public call offices (PCOs)1 operated by \n1. \nindividual  entrepreneurs  around  the  country,  each  generating  a  minimal  profit  for  Roshan,  but  a \nsubstantial $50\u2013$1,500 monthly profit per entrepreneur. This is a program similar to Grameenphone\u2019s \nVillage Phone project,2 whereby people without access to phones can access mobile phone services. \nThrough  a  partnership  with  First  MicroFinanceBank  Limited,  entrepreneurs  can  take  out  a \nmicrofinance  loan  for  the  capital  expenditure  in  acquiring  a  PCO  unit.  Roshan  subsidizes  the  initial \nairtime  allocation  to  a  retail  value  of  $250  per  unit.  In  the  fourth  quarter  (Q4)  of  2007,  Roshan \npartnered  with  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  to  roll  out  500  women\u2019s \nPCOs\u2014PCOs owned and operated by female entrepreneurs. Currently, there are 60 active women\u2019s \nPCOs  and  Roshan  has  identified  close  to  200  more  women  who  will  shortly  be  operating  PCOs. \nTable A7  indicates  the  growth  of  PCOs.  Roshan  is  now  expanding  PCOs  to  more  rural  areas  and \nlower-end entrepreneurs, so the revenue per PCO is falling as PCO numbers increase. \n\n \n\nTable A7: Roshan's Public Call Office Usage \n \n\nItem \n\nDecember 2005  December 2006  December 2007 \n\nGrowth  \n(2005\u20132007, %) \n\nActive PCOs \nTotal Usage ($) \n\n412 \n55,600 \n\n946 \n65,158 \n\n1,992 \n75,121 \n\n383 \n35 \n\nPCO = public call office. \nSource: Roshan. \n \n2. \nMedical  and  Health  Program. Roshan has a state-of-the-art medical and dental clinic in an \nunused  leased  building  (its  former  head  office),  which,  in  addition  to  providing  staff  with  access  to \ncheckups and medical and/or dental services, also conducts training for all staff in first aid and dental \nhygiene.  Family  members  of  all  Roshan  employees  are  able  to  use  the  clinic  facilities.  The  clinic \ncovers  operating  costs  by  providing  health  services  to  other  organizations,  such  as  embassies  and \nnongovernment organizations. Roshan is one of the first companies in Afghanistan to provide medical \ninsurance  benefits  for  local  national  staff.  Part  of  the  health  professionals\u2019  time  is  also  allocated  to \noutreach activities, e.g., working with local and rural orphanages on health education and prophylaxis. \nRoshan also sponsors, together with the Ministry of Public Health, training for laboratory technicians \nat the Aga Khan University in Pakistan. Telemedicine, another major initiative\u2014the first of its kind in \nAfghanistan\u2014was launched by Roshan in 2007. Using its network technology, Roshan has connected \nthe  French  Medical  Institute  for  Children,  the  largest  pediatric  hospital  in  Afghanistan,  with  the  Aga \nKhan  University  Hospital  in  Karachi,  Pakistan.  The  link  enables  real-time  support  and  diagnosis  as \nwell as training for Afghan medical staff at the French Medical Institute for Children in Kabul. \n \n3. \nSocial Welfare. Roshan\u2019s social programs focus on women and children as target audiences. \nIn  Afghanistan,  roughly  45%  of  the  population  is  under  15  years  of  age.  Roshan  has  a  number  of \npurely social initiatives across the country, including the following: \n \n\nSupport  for  the  Aschiana  orphanage.  Aschiana  provides  several  thousand  street \nchildren in Kabul and Mazar with shelter, food, and half-day education (the other half of \nthe  day,  the  children  can  retain  income-generating  activities).  Roshan  supports  the \nactivities  through  sponsorship  (e.g.,  a  soup  kitchen  that  feeds  50,000  meals  each \nmonth) and its health programs. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   Not  all  PCOs  issued  are  active:  130  of  the  active  PCOs  are  run  by  former  combatants  through  the  United  Nations\u2019 \n\ndemilitarization, demobilization, and reintegration program. \n\n2   The  village  phone  project  was  awarded  the  Development  Gateway  Foundation\u2019s  first  Petersberg  prize  for  \u201coutstanding \n\nachievement in the use of information and communication technologies to improve people\u2019s lives\u201d. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                       Appendix 7 \n\n67\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPlayground and park renovation. To date, six playgrounds and football pitches have \nbeen installed around Afghanistan, with three additional ones planned in 2008. \n\nSchool construction and donation of educational games, textbooks, and school \nsupplies for schools across Afghanistan. \n\nSport  and  recreational  events,  such  as  kite-flying  festivals  and  poetry \ncompetitions. Such events were banned under the Taliban and now serve to rebuild \ncollective civil pride based on culture.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Afghanistan: Roshan Expansion Project (Phase III) \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nDirect Loan  \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\nPrivate Sector Department \nInfrastructure Finance Division 1 \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project will address remaining unmet demand for affordable telecom services in semi-urban and rural areas. Increasing \nthe telephone density in a war-torn country such as Afghanistan is vital to the national reconstruction efforts. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nEstablishment of additional base transceiver stations (BTSs) will ensure that mobile telephone service reach almost all semi-\nurban and major areas to reach significant levels of population coverage, in order to offer more affordable mobile telephone \nservices. Additional public call offices will also be installed for those who cannot afford mobile phones. \n \n2.  Design  Features.  The  Project  will  provide  indirect  benefits  to  the  communities  in  general,  and  provide  income-earning \nopportunities to the rural communities where the BTSs are located.  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \n\ngroups affected.   Not applicable \n\n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them.  Not applicable \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. Not applicable \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nCommunities in the vicinity of the project areas will benefit from the availability of income-earning opportunities, e.g., income \nfrom  leased  land  for  5\u201315  years  and  employment  opportunities  during  construction  of  the  BTSs.  Improving  communication \nfacilities  in  the  area  will  provide  access  to  public  service  delivery,  education,  health,  and  security.  Roshan  will  also  provide \ndirect  training,  employment,  and  business  opportunities  in  underdeveloped  areas,  to  staff,  dealers,  and  subcontractors, \nincluding through the MicroReach program, targeted at women.  \n \nAbout  700  BTSs  in  60  districts  will  be  installed  either  on  rooftops  or  on  the  ground  on  leased  lands  in  urban  areas  and \nsparsely populated desert lands in rural areas. A typical BTS requires 144 square meters of land space. Sites will be leased \non a willing lessor-willing lessee basis. \n \nAlthough  there  are  a  number  of  ethnic  groups  in  Afghanistan  (e.g.,  the  Kuchi,  Pashtuns,  Tajiks,  Hazaras,  Uzbek,  Aimaks, \nTurkmen, Baloch, Brahui, Hindkowans, etc.), none of these ethnic groups will be affected as BTSs will be installed mostly on \nleased  lands  in  urban  areas  and  sparsely  populated  desert  lands  in  rural  areas.  No  BTS  will  be  located  in  any  historical \nstructures,  places  or  monuments,  wetlands  or  national  parks,  sanctuaries,  reserved  forests,  or  any  other  areas  with \narchaeological, historical, or recreational value. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n2.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.   \n \nConsultation and participation activities are integrated into the project preparation and construction phase.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nThe Project is not expected to cause any specific cultural or social impact on or exclude any socioeconomic group, including \nwomen, from benefiting from the Project. \n \n2.  Key  Actions.
