THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the Samoa Submarine Cable Project.1 \n \n2.  Under the proposed project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and \nthe Government of Australia will support the development and operation of a submarine fiber-\noptic cable system (SCS) linking Samoa to Fiji, where an existing international submarine cable \nnetwork will provide cost-effective access to the rest of the world. The project will also support \nreforms  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  and  legal  environment  for  the  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) sector and facilitate e-health investment. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Samoa  was  one  of  the  first  Pacific  countries  to  open  telecommunications  up  to \ncompetition through the Telecommunications Act 2005.2 Following market liberalization, total \ncustomers for fixed and mobile lines increased from 12,500 in 2002 to 152,800 in 2008. As of \nthe end of 2014, over 95% of the population was covered by mobile networks, while mobile \npenetration had reached 89% of the network-covered population. However, internet access is \nlagging  significantly  because  access  costs  are  high  relative  to  income  levels.  Broadband \npenetration was estimated at about 1% fixed and 27% mobile. Projected demand, if prices are \nlowered, is expected to grow from about 420 megabits per second now to 6 gigabits per second \n(Gbps) by 2021, and to 30 Gbps by 2028. \n \n4.  Internet prices are driven by the high wholesale internet bandwidth costs. Samoa relies \non a submarine cable and satellite service for its international internet connectivity. Samoa is \nconnected to the American Samoa\u2013Hawaii cable system via the Samoa\u2013American Samoa \ncable, which has a remaining useful life of 5 years. The current system capacity of 1 Gbps is \nabove Samoa\u2019s current bandwidth demand, but is below projected demand. The proposed SCS, \nwith a minimum capacity of 1 terabit per second and a regulated bandwidth price below current \nprice levels, will enable broader internet access and meet Samoa\u2019s growing demand. The \ncurrent ICT service providers are interested in investing in the SCS as a long-term solution to \ntheir  capacity  needs.  However,  given  the  significant  project  cost,  private  sector  interest  is \ninsufficient to invest in such a cable. Therefore, the government is supporting the investment to \nbridge the gap between the economic and financial viability of the project. ADB has supported \nsimilar projects in Tonga (also financed with the World Bank) and Solomon Islands.3 \n \n5.  The  Office  of  the  Regulator  (OOTR)  was  established  in  2006  to  regulate \ntelecommunications but has functioned as a multisector regulator, including electricity services, \nsince  2013.  The  SCS  aims  to  improve  access  to  international  connectivity;  hence,  the \ngovernment requires support to strengthen the legal and regulatory environment, as well as the \ncapacity of the OOTR to regulate international connectivity services to protect the long-term \ninterests of consumers. The OOTR, through its price control role, will ensure that any price \nsubsidies received by the Samoa Submarine Cable Company (SSCC) will be passed on to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Samoa. 2005.

Strong and robust regulation is essential to ensure that the SSCC does not engage \nin monopoly pricing or other anticompetitive behavior. \n \n6.  The ICT sector is recognized as an enabler of economic growth and development. \nReliable and affordable ICT helps create new business opportunities and with it employment. \nThe project will cater to increased demand for high bandwidth applications by businesses, \nhouseholds, and individuals. In 2014, the government launched the Samoa National Broadband \nHighway, an internet-ready fiber network linking all government offices, schools, and hospitals. \nWith affordable international connectivity, the SCS will boost the domestic network\u2019s delivery of \nbetter public services. \n \n7.  The  government  has  already  adopted  elements  of  e-education  with  the  support  of \ndevelopment  partners,4 and  ADB  also  provided  support  for  an  online  secured  transaction \nregistry and an online company registration.5 The government has now selected the health \nsector for implementation of an e-strategy to improve service delivery and reduce the reliance \non overseas medical care. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is planning and designing investments \nto effectively implement its 5-year health information strategy and has undertaken an initial \nneeds appraisal that found a patient information system to be a priority. The project will help the \ngovernment implement an e-health patient information solution, and explore e-health initiatives \nvia  better  ICT  accessibility,  domestically  through  the  national  broadband  highway  and \ninternationally through the SCS. \n \n8.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Pacific  Approach  20156 and  country \noperations business plan, for Samoa 2015\u20132017.7 It also aligns with a key outcome of the \nStrategy for the Development of Samoa 2012\u20132016, i.e., to facilitate universal access to reliable \nand affordable ICT services.8 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be aligned with the Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2012\u20132016, \nwhich aims at universal access to reliable and affordable ICT services. The outcome will be \nquality broadband services available at an affordable price and used for enhancing e-health. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  Output 1 is the establishment of the SSCC, a special-purpose vehicle to procure, own, \nand operate the cable system; and it will be the sole wholesaler of the cable capacity to the \nretail service providers. The SSCC will be a limited liability company, with local shareholding \ncomprising  existing  ICT  service  providers  and  three  state-owned  enterprises:  the  Samoa \nNational Provident Fund, the Unit Trust of Samoa, and the Samoa Life Assurance Corporation. \nThe  Government  of  Samoa  will  onlend  the  grants  from  the  financiers  to  the  SSCC.  The \ngovernment  will  retain  strategic  control  of  the  asset  through  covenants  in  the  subsidiary \nagreement relating to dividend and capacity pricing policies as well as its consent to any major \ndecisions that may impact the availability and affordability of capacity. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2005.

This will comprise the (i) \ndesign, supply, and installation of the SCS to connect Samoa to Fiji; and (ii) construction of \nlanding stations, terrestrial cable placement, and ancillary equipment in Upolu and Savai\u2019i, and \nsystem connections in Suva. In Fiji, the cable will use an existing landing station where the \nSamoa cable is connected to the Southern Cross Cable Network. \n \n12.  Output  3  is  an  improved  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  ICT.  The  proposed \nactivities will deepen the regulatory capacity of the OOTR by (i) reviewing and developing \neffective regulation for the ICT sector with a focus on the wholesale market; (ii) establishing \nwholesale tariffs, including price and nonprice terms for access to all international fiber-optic \nbandwidth services; (iii) procuring spectrum management monitoring equipment; (iv) training the \nOOTR staff; and (v) conducting a nationwide consumer survey on the benefits of ICT and \nexamining possible differences across demographic groups, including gender. \n \n13.  Output 4 supports investments in e-health solutions through a health information system. \nActivities  include  (i)  validating  the  needs  of  the  health  sector  and  clearly  defining  the \nrequirements for the system; (ii) conducting technical and financial due diligence; (iii) procuring \nthe  integrated  health  information  system  components;  (iv)  installing  and  configuring  the \nsystem\u2019s hardware and software components; (v) connecting to all users; (vi) migrating data \nsets  from  existing  systems  and  other  sources;  (vii)  ensuring  effective  operations  through \ncomprehensive testing; and (viii) conducting training for users and system administrators. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $57.41 million (Table 1).

The World Bank will provide parallel \n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Samoa had changed from high to \nmoderate risk of debt distress. Samoa is therefore eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund \nallocation as grants until 31 December 2015. \n ", "4 \ngrant financing of $16.0 million from International Development Association resources. The \nGovernment of Australia\u2019s parallel grant financing of $1.5 million will be disbursed through a \ndesignated trust fund, to be managed by the World Bank. \n \n16.  The government will make the proceeds of the grants from the cofinanciers available to \nthe SSCC through an onlending arrangement. The terms and conditions, which are subject to \nADB endorsement, are (i) 1.0% interest; and (ii) 30-year payback period, including a grace \nperiod of 7 years.11 A review after the 7\u2013year grace period will assess whether the SSCC can \nsustain principal repayments while maintaining low wholesale prices for capacity, in line with the \nproject\u2019s objectives. If not sustainable, the SSCC can apply for a price subsidy through the \nannual budget.12 The SSCC, through local investors, will provide equity financing equivalent to \n$8.18  million. The government  of  Samoa  will  bear  taxes  and  duties of  $6.73 million.

Project preparatory activities for the SCS were divided between ADB, the World Bank, \nand the government\u2019s project technical team.13 The World Health Organization supported the \npreparation  of  the  e-health  solutions  (output  4).  ADB  prepared  the  economic,  social,  and \nsafeguard assessments through regional technical assistance and staff consultant inputs.14 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for the project. MOF will \nalso be the implementing agency for output 1, and for output 2 until the SSCC is established. \nOnce the SSCC is operational, with a board of directors and a chief executive officer, it will be \nthe implementing agency for output 2, and will sign the contract for the construction of the SCS. \nOnce the SSCC is set up, it will enter into a project agreement with ADB. The OOTR will be the \nimplementing agency for output 3, and MOH will implement output 4. \n                                                \n11 On 16 September 2015, the cabinet (F.K.(15)31), approved the onlending arrangement, to be formalized in a \nsubsidiary agreement between the MOF and the SSCC. The 1% interest payment to the government will go toward \nfinancing activities to strengthen ICT sector development and regulation. The Financial Analysis and Economic \nAnalysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) assumes that principal repayments will be \npaid back to the SSCC as price subsidy after the 7-year grace period to maintain a low wholesale price of capacity. \n12 The government considers a price subsidy essential to facilitate greater uptake of broadband access, including by \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises and the wider population, thus ensuring that its benefits are more broadly \nspread. It is estimated that the subsidy will provide for a 25% reduction on the nonsubsidized wholesale bandwidth \nprice. The OOTR will ensure that the price subsidy is passed on to consumers through low retail prices. \n13 The government, with assistance from the Government of Australia, engaged a project technical team to provide \ntechnical and legal support to the government during project preparation. \n14 ADB. 2013.

An SCS is an integrated system of plant, materials, equipment, civil works, and services. \nFor technical reasons, consideration of economy and efficiency, management risks, and in view \nof the limited number of suppliers, the SCS is best procured as one contract. The contract will \nbe financed by ADB and the World Bank, using limited international bidding. The borrower will \nundertake, in its financing agreement with ADB, to conduct all procurement in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). ADB and the World Bank \nwill  enter  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  that  sets  out  detailed  collaboration  and \n                                                \n15 Government of Samoa. 2014.

The  World  Bank\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  are  largely  harmonized, \nexcept for references to debarment lists. The final bidding documents will be agreed between \nADB, the World Bank, and the government. ADB will be involved throughout the review process \nand exercise procurement oversight in accordance with its usual procurement procedures and \npractices  to  ensure  that  the  procurement  is  also  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines, and that no company on ADB\u2019s sanction list participated in the bidding \nprocess and is awarded the contract. The World Bank and ADB will use their best efforts to give \neffect to the other\u2019s eligibility requirements and debarment lists. Furthermore, contracts between \nthe bidder and the borrower will contain a provision permitting the World Bank and/or ADB to \ninspect the project and to inspect and audit all records and accounts of any bidders, contractors, \nsuppliers, or service providers as they relate to the project in accordance with their respective \npolicies and procedures. \n \n22.  If no mutually agreed decision can be reached on any procurement matter, and given \nthat the World Bank is the coordinating and lead financier, the World Bank\u2019s decision will \nprevail. ADB will have the right to take such actions as it reasonably considers necessary to (i) \nensure compliance with its procurement and anticorruption policies and related procedures, the \nterms  and  conditions  of  its  agreement(s)  with  the  borrower;  and  (ii)  realize  the  intended \ndevelopment objectives of the project. \n \n23.  A blanket waiver by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors of member country procurement eligibility \nrestrictions for operations funded by the Asian Development Fund applies to the procurement of \nthe  SCS,  thereby  permitting  participation  of  bidders  from  non-ADB  members  and/or \nprocurement of goods and services from non-ADB members. \n \n24.  The integrated health information system will include hardware, software, installation \ncosts, testing, and training. The system will be procured as one contract. A consulting firm will \nbe engaged to provide project management support to MOH to implement output 4.  Both \ncontracts will be fully financed by ADB, and procurement will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, (2015, as amended from time to time) and the firm will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  The project is expected to benefit the people of Samoa, through low-cost and high-\nquality broadband internet services. It will contribute to the economy\u2019s efficiency and bring new \nbusiness opportunities. It will also enhance the provision of health services and demonstrate the \nrole ICT can play in improved service delivery across this and other sectors. Due diligence was \nbased  on  detailed  technical,  regulatory,  environmental,  and  social  assessments,  and \nstakeholder consultations. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  Various options for improved internet services were examined from technical, economic, \nand strategic perspectives. These included cable connections via Tonga to Fiji, to New Zealand, \n ", "7 \nto planned regional cable projects, and geostationary and medium-earth orbit satellite. Two \noptions  warranted further  evaluation,  as  summarized  in  Table  4.  Considering the  lifespan, \ncapacity, and capital and operational expenditure, a new cable to Suva, Fiji was selected as the \nmost feasible and least-cost option, providing access to direct internet protocol transit services \nfrom Fiji suppliers, or cable extension capacity via Southern Cross to Australia, Hawaii, and the \nwest coast of the United States. \n \nTable 4: Options for Samoa Submarine Cable \n    Capital  Operational       \nPoint of    Expenditure  Expenditure  Lifespan  Capacity  Backhaul \nConnection  Type of Cable  ($ million)  ($ million)  (years)  (Tbps)  Costs ($) \nNew Zealand  PRE upgrade           \n(recovered cable)  44.8  2.1  25  3.2  0 \nFiji  New cable  30.3  1.3  25  3.2  0 \nPRE = PacRim East cable, Tbps = terabit per second. \nSource: Government of Samoa project technical team. \n \n27.  The  two  alternatives  (recovered  or  new  cable)  are  both  sound  from  a  technical \nengineering viewpoint since they offer similar risk profile, capacity, warranties, and delivery time. \nHowever, for bidding purposes, the primary option is for a new cable, mainly because of the \notherwise limited scope for competition with only two known suppliers dealing in both recovered \nand new cable. Instead, bids for recovered cables will be considered as alternatives. \n \n28.  The project is rated low risk according to the preliminary climate risk screening. The \ncable  is  not  likely  to  be  affected  by  changes  in  climate  conditions,  and  it  is  resilient  to \nearthquake risk and other disasters caused by natural hazards given its embedded location on \nthe  seabed.  The  landing  stations  will  be  constructed  in  accordance  with  proper  building \nguidelines to mitigate the potential impacts of disasters caused by natural hazards. \n \n29.  The World Health Organization has conducted an analysis of alternatives for a health \ninformation system and developed high-level technical use cases and requirements for the \nenvisioned solution. Building on this work, the project will validate the identified health sector \nneeds, and help clearly define and detail the health information system to best meet needs. \nOnce  this  technical  due  diligence  is  completed,  ADB  will  support  investment  in  the  most \nappropriate system. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n30.  Economic  analysis.  Economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  a  resilient  and \nconservative modeling basis to quantify benefits, which were assumed proportional to internet \nusers\u2019  willingness  to  pay.  Given  existing,  though  costly,  broadband  services  in  Samoa,  a \ndifferentiation between existing users and future users has been considered for benefits and \nconsumer surplus estimations. For both the economic and financial evaluation, a top-down \nmethodology  is  used  for  broadband  capacity  demand  projections  by  benchmarking  other \nbroadband connectivity projects in the region. All project outputs, including activities not directly \nrelated  to  the  SCS,  such  as  support  to  the  OOTR  and  the  e-health  system,  have  been \nconsidered  in  the  analysis  as  essential  for  achieving  maximum  project  benefits.  Similarly, \nbroadband-related  costs  outside  the  project\u2019s  scope,  such  as  incremental  costs  to \ntelecommunication providers, were included. Total benefits per year were reasonably capped at \n2% of gross domestic product. Overall, the analysis shows that the project is economically \nviable with a net present value of $41.2 million and an economic internal rate of return at 21.2%, \n ", "8 \ncomfortably exceeding the default social discount rate of 12.0%. The project remains viable \nunder scenarios of 25% lower benefits, 10% higher capital costs, or 10% higher operating costs. \n \n31.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis concluded that SSCC has sufficient capacity \nto cover ongoing operations and maintenance costs and debt servicing. The financial benefits \nwere estimated from the revenue accruing to the SSCC, which is calculated based on demand \nfor international bandwidth multiplied by the SSCC\u2019s proposed wholesale tariffs. The pricing \nstructure is set at a level that covers fixed costs for cable maintenance contracts, landing station \noperations and general operations of SSCC as well as variable cost provisions for unplanned \nrepairs and demand driven internet transit costs. A price subsidy, equivalent to the principal \nrepayments of the debt to the government, will be paid to the SSCC annually to maintain the \nassumed  minimum  wholesale  prices.  Such  reduced  wholesale  price  benefits  the  project\u2019s \nobjective to increase affordable access to broadband services. SSCC will maintain a positive \nnet free cash flow and cash balance after incorporating the price subsidy, while net earnings \nturn positive in year 18. Return on equity is capped at a maximum of 10% based on respective \nequity contributions. Dividend is declared by the board, which ensures that payouts are not \ndetrimental to the long-term sustainability of the SSCC. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n32.  Financial  management.  The  World  Bank  undertook  the  financial  management \nassessment for the project and ADB will rely on its findings.16 The World Bank rated the overall \ninherent risk as substantial, and overall control and financial management risk as moderate. The \nkey  risk  relates  to  the  SSCC\u2019s  capacity,  as  a  start-up  company,  to  meet  the  financial \nmanagement requirements of ADB-financed projects. To mitigate this, MOF\u2014familiar with ADB \nfinancial management requirements given its role as executing agency in all ADB projects\u2014will \nbe responsible for the overall financial management of the project. A full-time qualified project \naccountant  will  be  recruited  to  the  project  management  unit  to  monitor  all  project-related \nfinancial activities. MOF will submit an independent appraisal of the proposed structure of the \nSSCC. Once the SSCC is fully operational, the World Bank will conduct a fiduciary assessment \n(financial management and procurement) prior to signing the project agreement with the SSCC. \nADB will rely on this assessment. \n \n33.  Procurement. The overall procurement-related risk is rated high. While the government \nhas considerable experience in implementing ADB-financed projects, the SSCC and MOH have \nno such experience. To manage the risk for procurement of the SCS, MOF, supported by the \nproject technical team, is facilitating advance contracting, while project implementation support \nwill be provided to the SSCC and MOH. \n \n34.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MOF. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n35.  The project will indirectly reduce poverty by lowering the cost of communication and \nboosting access to information and services essential for socioeconomic development. It will \nhelp  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  private  sector  activities  as  well  as  public \nservices. The project will impact tourism related-services, health, and education, and will build \n                                                \n16 World Bank. 2015. Proposed Grant to the Independent State of Samoa in Support of the Pacific Regional \nConnectivity Program Samoa Connectivity Project. Washington, DC. \n ", "9 \non ongoing ICT initiatives like SchoolNet17 and the Feso'otai Center projects.18 It will create new \nbusiness  opportunities,  like  business  process  outsourcing,  and  web-based  services,  thus \ncreating employment. The project will bolster regional integration and cooperation through an \nexpanded  communication  network,  enabling  increased  traffic  volume.  This  improves \ncommunications  with  expatriate  Samoans,  encourages  international  trade  in  goods  and \nservices, and improves market access for micro businesses. A spur to the less-populated island \nof Savai\u2019i aims to promote social equity in terms of access. \n \n36.  The project is classified as \u201csome gender elements.\u201d A basic gender equality issue in \nICT is limited access to reliable communication services. With improved telecommunications, \nincreased availability of access points in communities, and more affordable communications, \nwomen will have better access to education and health services, among others. Currently, \nwomen are less likely to go off-island to continue their studies, being tightly embedded within \ntheir families and communities. Women have expressed a strong desire to attain higher levels of \neducation, and improved international connectivity will allow them access to online educational \nopportunities. Under the project, a nationwide consumer survey on the benefits of ICT (under \noutput 3) will enable the exploration of possible differences in the use and benefits of ICT \nservices  across  different  demographic  groups,  particularly  between  men  and  women,  and \ndevelop targeted outreach activities based on the results. Gender benefits will accrue from \nstronger health information management, i.e., it improves sex-disaggregated data collection and \nanalysis, which in turn provides evidence for the planning of health services for women. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n37.  The project is classified as category B for environment. During the construction and \ninstallation phase, the environmental impacts are expected to be site-specific and limited to the \nroute of the cable to be laid, landing sites, and landward cable routes. The environmental \nmanagement plan, prepared during project preparation, will be updated during the marine route \nsurvey and detailed design. Any data gaps identified during project preparation will be filled at \nthis time. The borrower and, subsequently, the SSCC will have adequate institutional capacity to \nmanage the environmental risk. \n \n38.  The project has been classified a category C for both involuntary resettlement and for \nindigenous peoples. The due diligence confirmed that the cable landing sites and stations will \nbe on government land and the cable route to the cable stations will follow existing road \ncorridors. No impact on livelihoods or physical displacement is expected. The project areas \ncomprise  Samoa\u2019s  mainstream  population.  The  project  will  not  impact  any  distinct  and \nvulnerable indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The overall risk assessment is medium, \nand the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2007.
