The project will also support \nreforms \ninformation  and \nthe  regulatory  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) sector and facilitate e-health investment. \n \n\nlegal  environment \n\nto  strengthen \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nSamoa  was  one  of  the  first  Pacific  countries  to  open  telecommunications  up  to \n3. \ncompetition  through  the  Telecommunications  Act  2005.2 Following  market  liberalization,  total \ncustomers for fixed and mobile lines increased from 12,500 in 2002 to 152,800  in 2008. As of \nthe  end  of  2014,  over  95%  of  the  population  was  covered  by  mobile  networks,  while  mobile \npenetration  had  reached  89%  of  the  network-covered  population.  However,  internet  access  is \nlagging  significantly  because  access  costs  are  high  relative  to  income  levels.  Broadband \npenetration was estimated at about 1% fixed and 27% mobile. Projected demand, if prices are \nlowered, is expected to grow from about 420 megabits per second now to 6 gigabits per second \n(Gbps) by 2021, and to 30 Gbps by 2028. \n \n4. \nInternet prices are driven by the high wholesale internet bandwidth costs.  Samoa relies \non  a  submarine  cable  and  satellite  service  for  its  international  internet  connectivity.  Samoa  is \nconnected  to  the  American  Samoa\u2013Hawaii  cable  system  via  the  Samoa\u2013American  Samoa \ncable,  which  has  a remaining  useful  life  of  5  years.  The  current  system  capacity  of  1 Gbps  is \nabove Samoa\u2019s current bandwidth demand, but is below projected demand. The proposed SCS, \nwith a minimum capacity of 1 terabit per second and a regulated bandwidth price below current \nprice  levels,  will  enable  broader  internet  access  and  meet  Samoa\u2019s  growing  demand.  The \ncurrent ICT  service providers  are  interested  in investing  in the  SCS  as  a  long-term  solution to \ntheir  capacity  needs.  However,  given  the  significant  project  cost,  private  sector  interest  is \ninsufficient to invest in such a cable. Therefore, the government is supporting the investment to \nbridge the gap between the economic and financial viability of the project. ADB has supported \nsimilar projects in Tonga (also financed with the World Bank) and Solomon Islands.3 \n \n5. \nregulate \ntelecommunications but has functioned as a multisector regulator, including electricity services, \nsince  2013.  The  SCS  aims  to  improve  access  to  international  connectivity;  hence,  the \ngovernment requires support to strengthen the legal and regulatory environment, as well as the \ncapacity  of  the  OOTR  to  regulate  international  connectivity  services  to  protect  the  long-term \ninterests  of  consumers.  The  OOTR,  through  its  price  control  role,  will  ensure  that  any  price \nsubsidies  received  by  the  Samoa  Submarine  Cable  Company  (SSCC)  will  be  passed  on  to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Government of Samoa. 2005.

Strong and robust regulation is essential to ensure that the SSCC does not engage \nin monopoly pricing or other anticompetitive behavior. \n \n6. \nThe  ICT  sector  is  recognized  as  an  enabler  of  economic  growth  and  development. \nReliable  and  affordable  ICT  helps  create  new  business  opportunities  and  with  it  employment. \nThe  project  will  cater  to  increased  demand  for  high  bandwidth  applications  by  businesses, \nhouseholds, and individuals. In 2014, the government launched the Samoa National Broadband \nHighway, an internet-ready fiber network linking all government offices, schools, and hospitals. \nWith affordable international connectivity, the SCS will boost the domestic network\u2019s delivery of \nbetter public services. \n \n7. \nThe  government  has  already  adopted  elements  of  e-education  with  the  support  of \ndevelopment  partners, 4  and  ADB  also  provided  support  for  an  online  secured  transaction \nregistry  and  an  online  company  registration.5 The  government  has  now  selected  the  health \nsector for  implementation  of  an  e-strategy  to  improve service delivery  and reduce the reliance \non overseas medical care. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is planning and designing investments \nto  effectively  implement  its  5-year  health  information  strategy  and  has  undertaken  an  initial \nneeds appraisal that found a patient information system to be a priority. The project will help the \ngovernment implement an e-health patient information solution, and explore e-health initiatives \nvia  better  ICT  accessibility,  domestically  through  the  national  broadband  highway  and \ninternationally through the SCS. \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Pacific  Approach  2015 6  and  country \n8. \noperations  business  plan,  for  Samoa  2015\u20132017.7 It  also  aligns  with  a  key  outcome  of  the \nStrategy for the Development of Samoa 2012\u20132016, i.e., to facilitate universal access to reliable \nand affordable ICT services.8 \n \nB. \n \nThe impact will be aligned with the Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2012\u20132016, \n9. \nwhich  aims  at  universal  access  to  reliable  and  affordable  ICT  services.  The  outcome  will  be \nquality broadband services available at an affordable price and used for enhancing e-health. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nOutput 1 is the establishment of the SSCC, a special-purpose vehicle to procure, own, \nand  operate  the  cable  system;  and  it  will  be  the  sole  wholesaler  of  the  cable  capacity  to  the \nretail  service  providers.  The  SSCC  will  be  a  limited  liability  company,  with  local  shareholding \ncomprising  existing  ICT  service  providers  and  three  state-owned  enterprises:  the  Samoa \nNational Provident Fund, the Unit Trust of Samoa, and the Samoa Life Assurance Corporation. \nThe  Government  of  Samoa  will  onlend  the  grants  from  the  financiers  to  the  SSCC.  The \ngovernment  will  retain  strategic  control  of  the  asset  through  covenants  in  the  subsidiary \nagreement relating to dividend and capacity pricing policies as well as its consent to any major \ndecisions that may impact the availability and affordability of capacity. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2005.

This will comprise the (i) \ndesign,  supply,  and  installation  of  the  SCS  to  connect  Samoa  to  Fiji;  and  (ii)  construction  of \nlanding stations, terrestrial cable placement, and ancillary equipment in Upolu and Savai\u2019i, and \nsystem  connections  in  Suva.  In  Fiji,  the  cable  will  use  an  existing  landing  station  where  the \nSamoa cable is connected to the Southern Cross Cable Network. \n \n12. \nOutput  3  is  an  improved  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  ICT.  The  proposed \nactivities  will  deepen  the  regulatory  capacity  of  the  OOTR  by  (i)  reviewing  and  developing \neffective  regulation  for  the  ICT  sector  with  a  focus  on  the  wholesale  market;  (ii)  establishing \nwholesale  tariffs,  including  price  and  nonprice  terms  for  access  to  all  international  fiber-optic \nbandwidth services; (iii) procuring spectrum management monitoring equipment; (iv) training the \nOOTR  staff;  and  (v)  conducting  a  nationwide  consumer  survey  on  the  benefits  of  ICT  and \nexamining possible differences across demographic groups, including gender. \n\n13. \nOutput 4 supports investments in e-health solutions through a health information system. \nActivities  include  (i)  validating  the  needs  of  the  health  sector  and  clearly  defining  the \nrequirements for the system; (ii) conducting technical and financial due diligence; (iii) procuring \nthe  integrated  health  information  system  components;  (iv)  installing  and  configuring  the \nsystem\u2019s  hardware  and  software  components;  (v)  connecting  to  all  users;  (vi)  migrating  data \nsets  from  existing  systems  and  other  sources;  (vii)  ensuring  effective  operations  through \ncomprehensive testing; and (viii) conducting training for users and system administrators. \n\n \nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nD. \n \n14. \nexpenditure category and by financier, are in the project administration manual (PAM).9 \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $57.41  million  (Table  1).

The  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis  determined  that  Samoa  had  changed  from  high  to \nmoderate  risk  of  debt  distress.  Samoa  is  therefore  eligible  to  receive  100%  of  its  Asian  Development  Fund \nallocation as grants until 31 December 2015. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ngrant  financing  of  $16.0  million  from  International  Development  Association  resources.  The \nGovernment  of  Australia\u2019s  parallel  grant  financing  of  $1.5  million  will  be  disbursed  through  a \ndesignated trust fund, to be managed by the World Bank. \n \nThe government will make the proceeds of the grants from the cofinanciers available to \n16. \nthe  SSCC  through  an  onlending  arrangement. The terms  and conditions,  which are  subject  to \nADB  endorsement,  are  (i)  1.0%  interest;  and  (ii)  30-year  payback  period,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 7 years.11 A review after the 7\u2013year grace period will assess whether the SSCC can \nsustain principal repayments while maintaining low wholesale prices for capacity, in line with the \nproject\u2019s  objectives.  If  not  sustainable,  the  SSCC  can  apply  for  a  price  subsidy  through  the \nannual budget.12 The SSCC, through local investors, will provide equity financing equivalent to \n$8.18  million.  The  government  of  Samoa  will  bear  taxes  and  duties  of  $6.73  million.

ADB  prepared  the  economic,  social,  and \nsafeguard assessments through regional technical assistance and staff consultant inputs.14 \n \nE. \n \n18. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  project.  MOF  will \nalso  be  the  implementing agency for  output  1,  and for  output  2  until  the SSCC  is  established. \nOnce the SSCC is operational, with a board of directors and a chief executive officer, it will be \nthe implementing agency for output 2, and will sign the contract for the construction of the SCS. \nOnce the SSCC is set up, it will enter into a project agreement with ADB. The OOTR will be the \nimplementing agency for output 3, and MOH will implement output 4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n11 On  16  September  2015,  the  cabinet  (F.K.(15)31),  approved  the  onlending  arrangement,  to  be  formalized  in  a \nsubsidiary agreement between the MOF and the SSCC. The 1% interest payment to the government will go toward \nfinancing  activities  to  strengthen  ICT  sector  development  and  regulation.  The  Financial  Analysis  and  Economic \nAnalysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  assumes  that  principal  repayments  will  be \npaid back to the SSCC as price subsidy after the 7-year grace period to maintain a low wholesale price of capacity. \n12 The government considers a price subsidy essential to facilitate greater uptake of broadband access, including by \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  the  wider  population,  thus  ensuring  that  its  benefits  are  more  broadly \nspread. It is estimated that the subsidy will provide for a 25% reduction on the nonsubsidized wholesale bandwidth \nprice. The OOTR will ensure that the price subsidy is passed on to consumers through low retail prices. \n\n13 The government, with assistance from the Government of Australia, engaged a project technical team to provide \n\ntechnical and legal support to the government during project preparation. \n\n14 ADB. 2013.

The  World  Bank\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  are  largely  harmonized, \nexcept  for  references  to  debarment  lists.  The  final  bidding  documents  will  be  agreed  between \nADB, the World Bank, and the government. ADB will be involved throughout the review process \nand exercise  procurement  oversight  in accordance with its  usual  procurement  procedures  and \npractices  to  ensure  that  the  procurement  is  also  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines, and that no company on ADB\u2019s sanction list participated in the bidding \nprocess and is awarded the contract. The World Bank and ADB will use their best efforts to give \neffect to the other\u2019s eligibility requirements and debarment lists. Furthermore, contracts between \nthe  bidder  and the  borrower  will  contain  a  provision  permitting  the World  Bank  and/or  ADB  to \ninspect the project and to inspect and audit all records and accounts of any bidders, contractors, \nsuppliers,  or  service providers  as  they relate to  the  project  in  accordance with their  respective \npolicies and procedures. \n \n22. \nIf  no  mutually  agreed  decision  can  be  reached  on  any  procurement  matter,  and  given \nthat  the  World  Bank  is  the  coordinating  and  lead  financier,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  decision  will \nprevail. ADB will have the right to take such actions as it reasonably considers necessary to (i) \nensure compliance with its procurement and anticorruption policies and related procedures, the \nterms  and  conditions  of  its  agreement(s)  with  the  borrower;  and  (ii)  realize  the  intended \ndevelopment objectives of the project. \n \n23. \nA blanket waiver by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors of member country procurement eligibility \nrestrictions for operations funded by the Asian Development Fund applies to the procurement of \nthe  SCS, \nfrom  non-ADB  members  and/or \nprocurement of goods and services from non-ADB members. \n \n24. \nThe  integrated  health  information  system  will  include  hardware,  software,  installation \ncosts, testing, and training. The system will be procured as one contract. A consulting firm will \nbe  engaged  to  provide  project  management  support  to  MOH  to  implement  output  4.  Both \ncontracts will be fully financed by ADB, and procurement will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines,  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  firm  will  be \nengaged  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for  the  Use of  Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n\nthereby  permitting  participation  of  bidders \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nThe  project  is  expected  to  benefit  the  people  of  Samoa,  through  low-cost  and  high-\n25. \nquality broadband internet services. It will contribute to the economy\u2019s efficiency and bring new \nbusiness opportunities. It will also enhance the provision of health services and demonstrate the \nrole ICT can play in improved service delivery across this and other sectors. Due diligence was \ntechnical,  regulatory,  environmental,  and  social  assessments,  and \nbased  on  detailed \nstakeholder consultations. \n \nA. \n \n26. \nVarious options for improved internet services were examined from technical, economic, \nand strategic perspectives. These included cable connections via Tonga to Fiji, to New Zealand, \n\nTechnical \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fto  planned  regional  cable  projects,  and  geostationary  and  medium-earth  orbit  satellite.  Two \noptions  warranted  further  evaluation,  as  summarized  in  Table  4.  Considering  the  lifespan, \ncapacity, and capital and operational expenditure, a new cable to Suva, Fiji was selected as the \nmost feasible and least-cost option, providing access to direct internet protocol transit services \nfrom Fiji suppliers, or cable extension capacity via Southern Cross to Australia, Hawaii, and the \nwest coast of the United States. \n \n\nTable 4: Options for Samoa Submarine Cable \n\n \n \nType of Cable \n\n \nPoint of \nConnection \nNew Zealand \n\n \nLifespan \n(years) \n \n25 \n25 \n\n \nCapacity \n(Tbps) \n \n3.2 \n3.2 \n\n \nBackhaul \nCosts ($) \n \n0 \n0 \n\nOperational \nExpenditure \n($ million) \n \n2.1 \n1.3 \n\nCapital \nExpenditure \n($ million) \n \nPRE upgrade \n44.8 \n(recovered cable) \nFiji \n30.3 \nNew cable \nPRE = PacRim East cable, Tbps = terabit per second. \nSource: Government of Samoa project technical team. \n \nThe  two  alternatives  (recovered  or  new  cable)  are  both  sound  from  a  technical \n27. \nengineering viewpoint since they offer similar risk profile, capacity, warranties, and delivery time. \nHowever,  for  bidding  purposes,  the  primary  option  is  for  a  new  cable,  mainly  because  of  the \notherwise limited scope for competition with only two known suppliers dealing in both recovered \nand new cable. Instead, bids for recovered cables will be considered as alternatives. \n \n28. \nThe  project  is  rated  low  risk  according  to  the  preliminary  climate  risk  screening.  The \ncable  is  not  likely  to  be  affected  by  changes  in  climate  conditions,  and  it  is  resilient  to \nearthquake risk and other disasters caused by natural hazards given its embedded location on \nthe  seabed.  The  landing  stations  will  be  constructed  in  accordance  with  proper  building \nguidelines to mitigate the potential impacts of disasters caused by natural hazards. \n \nThe  World  Health  Organization  has  conducted  an  analysis  of  alternatives  for  a  health \n29. \ninformation  system  and  developed  high-level  technical  use  cases  and  requirements  for  the \nenvisioned  solution.  Building  on  this  work,  the  project  will  validate  the  identified  health  sector \nneeds,  and  help  clearly  define  and  detail  the  health  information  system  to  best  meet  needs. \nOnce  this  technical  due  diligence  is  completed,  ADB  will  support  investment  in  the  most \nappropriate system. \n \nB. \n \n30. \nEconomic  analysis.  Economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  a  resilient  and \nconservative modeling  basis  to quantify  benefits,  which  were  assumed  proportional  to internet \nusers\u2019  willingness  to  pay.  Given  existing,  though  costly,  broadband  services  in  Samoa,  a \ndifferentiation  between  existing  users  and  future  users  has  been  considered  for  benefits  and \nconsumer  surplus  estimations.  For  both  the  economic  and  financial  evaluation,  a  top-down \nmethodology  is  used  for  broadband  capacity  demand  projections  by  benchmarking  other \nbroadband connectivity projects in the region. All project outputs, including activities not directly \nrelated  to  the  SCS,  such  as  support  to  the  OOTR  and  the  e-health  system,  have  been \nconsidered  in  the  analysis  as  essential  for  achieving  maximum  project  benefits.  Similarly, \nbroadband-related  costs  outside \nto \ntelecommunication providers, were included. Total benefits per year were reasonably capped at \n2%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Overall,  the  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  economically \nviable with a net present value of $41.2 million and an economic internal rate of return at 21.2%, \n\nthe  project\u2019s  scope,  such  as \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nincremental  costs \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\ncomfortably  exceeding  the  default  social  discount  rate  of  12.0%.  The  project  remains  viable \nunder scenarios of 25% lower benefits, 10% higher capital costs, or 10% higher operating costs. \n \n31. \nFinancial  analysis. The financial analysis concluded that SSCC has sufficient capacity \nto cover  ongoing  operations  and maintenance costs  and debt  servicing.  The financial  benefits \nwere estimated from the revenue accruing to the SSCC, which is calculated based on demand \nfor  international  bandwidth  multiplied  by  the  SSCC\u2019s  proposed  wholesale  tariffs.  The  pricing \nstructure is set at a level that covers fixed costs for cable maintenance contracts, landing station \noperations  and general  operations  of  SSCC  as well  as  variable  cost  provisions  for  unplanned \nrepairs  and  demand  driven  internet  transit  costs.  A  price  subsidy,  equivalent  to  the  principal \nrepayments  of  the  debt  to  the  government,  will  be  paid  to  the  SSCC  annually  to  maintain the \nassumed  minimum  wholesale  prices.  Such  reduced  wholesale  price  benefits  the  project\u2019s \nobjective  to  increase  affordable  access  to  broadband  services.  SSCC  will  maintain  a  positive \nnet  free  cash  flow  and  cash  balance  after  incorporating  the  price  subsidy,  while  net  earnings \nturn positive in year 18. Return on equity is capped at a maximum of 10% based on respective \nequity  contributions.  Dividend  is  declared  by  the  board,  which  ensures  that  payouts  are  not \ndetrimental to the long-term sustainability of the SSCC. \n \nC. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  World  Bank  undertook  the  financial  management \n32. \nassessment for the project and ADB will rely on its findings.16 The World Bank rated the overall \ninherent risk as substantial, and overall control and financial management risk as moderate. The \nkey  risk  relates  to  the  SSCC\u2019s  capacity,  as  a  start-up  company,  to  meet  the  financial \nmanagement requirements of ADB-financed projects. To mitigate this, MOF\u2014familiar with ADB \nfinancial management requirements given its role as executing agency in all ADB projects\u2014will \nbe  responsible for the  overall  financial  management  of the  project.  A full-time qualified  project \naccountant  will  be  recruited  to  the  project  management  unit  to  monitor  all  project-related \nfinancial  activities.  MOF will  submit  an  independent  appraisal  of  the  proposed  structure  of  the \nSSCC. Once the SSCC is fully operational, the World Bank will conduct a fiduciary assessment \n(financial management and procurement) prior to signing the project agreement with the SSCC. \nADB will rely on this assessment. \n \n33. \nProcurement. The overall procurement-related risk is rated high. While the government \nhas considerable experience in implementing ADB-financed projects, the SSCC and MOH have \nno  such  experience. To manage  the  risk for  procurement  of  the  SCS,  MOF, supported  by  the \nproject technical team, is facilitating advance contracting, while project implementation support \nwill be provided to the SSCC and MOH. \n \n34. \nAnticorruption  policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe  project  will  indirectly  reduce  poverty  by  lowering  the  cost  of  communication  and \nboosting  access  to  information  and  services  essential  for  socioeconomic  development.  It  will \nhelp  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  private  sector  activities  as  well  as  public \nservices. The  project  will  impact tourism  related-services,  health,  and  education,  and  will  build \n                                                \n16 World  Bank.  2015.  Proposed  Grant  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  in  Support  of  the  Pacific  Regional \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nConnectivity Program Samoa Connectivity Project. Washington, DC. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fincreased \n\ntraffic  volume.  This \n\non ongoing ICT initiatives like SchoolNet17 and the Feso'otai Center projects.18 It will create new \nbusiness  opportunities,  like  business  process  outsourcing,  and  web-based  services,  thus \ncreating  employment.  The  project  will  bolster  regional  integration  and  cooperation  through  an \nexpanded  communication  network,  enabling \nimproves \ncommunications  with  expatriate  Samoans,  encourages  international  trade  in  goods  and \nservices, and improves market access for micro businesses. A spur to the less-populated island \nof Savai\u2019i aims to promote social equity in terms of access. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  \u201csome  gender  elements.\u201d  A  basic  gender  equality  issue  in \n36. \nICT  is  limited  access  to  reliable  communication  services.  With  improved  telecommunications, \nincreased  availability  of  access  points  in  communities,  and  more  affordable  communications, \nwomen  will  have  better  access  to  education  and  health  services,  among  others.  Currently, \nwomen  are  less  likely  to  go  off-island  to  continue  their  studies,  being  tightly  embedded  within \ntheir families and communities. Women have expressed a strong desire to attain higher levels of \neducation, and improved international connectivity will allow them access to online educational \nopportunities.  Under  the  project,  a  nationwide  consumer  survey  on  the  benefits  of  ICT  (under \noutput  3)  will  enable  the  exploration  of  possible  differences  in  the  use  and  benefits  of  ICT \nservices  across  different  demographic  groups,  particularly  between  men  and  women,  and \ndevelop  targeted  outreach  activities  based  on  the  results.  Gender  benefits  will  accrue  from \nstronger health information management, i.e., it improves sex-disaggregated data collection and \nanalysis, which in turn provides evidence for the planning of health services for women. \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  During  the  construction  and \n37. \ninstallation phase, the environmental impacts are expected to be site-specific and limited to the \nroute  of  the  cable  to  be  laid,  landing  sites,  and  landward  cable  routes.  The  environmental \nmanagement plan, prepared during project preparation, will be updated during the marine route \nsurvey and detailed design. Any data gaps identified during project preparation will be filled at \nthis time. The borrower and, subsequently, the SSCC will have adequate institutional capacity to \nmanage the environmental risk. \n \nThe  project  has  been  classified  a  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  for \n38. \nindigenous  peoples.  The  due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  cable  landing  sites  and  stations  will \nbe  on  government  land  and  the  cable  route  to  the  cable  stations  will  follow  existing  road \ncorridors.  No  impact  on  livelihoods  or  physical  displacement  is  expected.  The  project  areas \ncomprise  Samoa\u2019s  mainstream  population.  The  project  will  not  impact  any  distinct  and \nvulnerable indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.19 The  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium, \nand the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2007.
