The impact of subprogram 2 is aligned \nwith increased private investment, economic diversification, and competitiveness. The outcome \nwill be increased capabilities and opportunities of businesses to set up and expand higher value-\nadded  production.  Subprogram  2  includes  13  policy  actions  to  deliver  three  outputs  approved \nunder the program: (i) reduced cost of doing business, (ii) strengthened protection for businesses, \nand  (iii)  increased  business  innovation  and  productivity.  Subprogram  2  also  includes  two \nimportant loan effectiveness conditions. \n \n3. \n \n\nSubprogram 2 was declared effective on 22 September 2017. \n\n \n\nII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC SITUATION \n\n4. \nEconomic growth in Tajikistan slowed to 6.0% in the first half of 2017 from 6.5% in the \nsame  period  of  2016.  Industry  expanded  by  21.3%,  up  from  12.1%  a  year  earlier  on  gains  of \n26.3% in mining, 20.9% in manufacturing, and 16.2% in electricity generation. Retail trade and \nservices grew  by  3.6% despite low  remittances.  Average  annual  inflation accelerated  to  7.7%, \nmainly because the recapitalization of troubled banks led to a 17.8% increase in the broad money \nsupply. Consumer prices rose cumulatively by 5.9% in the first half of 2017, up from 3.1% a year \nearlier, reflecting price increases of 8.3% for food, 1.3% for other goods, and 4.9% for services. \nTo curb inflation, the National Bank of Tajikistan raised the refinancing rate by 5 percentage points \nin two steps\u2014from 11.0% to 12.5% in February 2017 and to 16.0% in March. It also more than \ndoubled  open  market  sales  of  securities  and  treasury  bills  to  rein  in  liquidity.  Despite  these \nmeasures, the somoni depreciated by 11.9% against the United States dollar in the first half of \n2017, mainly because the official exchange rate became realigned with the market rate.  \n \n Tajikistan\u2019s  fiscal  situation  is  presented  in  Table  1.  General  revenue  and  grants \n5. \nconstituted about 24% of gross domestic product (GDP) excluding special funds and grants for \npublic  investment  projects  from  development  partners.  If  those  funds  were  included,  general \nrevenue and grants was about 29% of GDP in the same year. Deficit will remain at around 4% of \nGDP without further fiscal initiatives. There will be one percentage point decline in deficit between \n2017 and 2019. Public debt to GDP ratio will decline from 47% in 2017 to 43% in 2020. \n \n6. \nUncertain remittances contributed to a 15.0% decline in imports in the first half of 2017, \nwhile  higher  industrial  production  contributed  to  a  73.4%  rise  in  exports.  The  current  account \ndeficit is forecast at about 5.5% of GDP in both 2017 and 2018 because of further anticipated \ncurrency depreciation and uncertainty about remittances. \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2016.

Significant  deficiencies  in  corporate  governance,  credit  underwriting,  risk \nmanagement, and prudential supervision of the banks also pose challenges to the solvency of \nthe  banking  system.  This  has  constrained  the  ability  of  banks  to  provide  funding  for  private \ninvestments.  The  high  liquidity  and  solvency  risks  require  substantial  sovereign  liquidity  and \ncapital support that are likely to be challenging in the context of Tajikistan\u2019s fiscal consolidation \ninitiatives. \n \n\n\f3 \n\nADB takes the view that the AQRs provided valuable information on the solvency of the \n9. \nbanking  system  that  was  hitherto  not  available.  More  importantly  the  AQRs  constitute  an \nimportant  milestone  to  understand  the  scope  of  banking  system  risks  as  a  basis  for  a  more \nintensive  policy  dialogue  of  ADB  with  government  and  in  coordination  with  the  IMF  and  other \ninternational financial institutions. In this respect, the AQRs are viewed satisfactory as required \nby ADB\u2019s loan effectiveness conditions.3  \n \n10. \nADB helped the government prepare a comprehensive fiscal strategy document,  which \nwas approved and adopted by the government on 21 September 2017. The medium-term fiscal \nstrategy is a combination of (i) revenue-led fiscal consolidation, and (ii) moderation in expenditure \ngrowth and shifting away from recurrent to growth promoting capital expenditure. The strategy \nrequires an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio in the medium term. If the deficit is kept at 2.5% of \nGDP, the debt path would be sustainable in the medium term.

It  has  fully  complied  with  11  policy  actions  and  incurred  adjustment  costs  as \nenvisaged under subprogram 2.5 There are two policy actions which are not fully complied with. \nThe government has completed all the actions related to the web portal (substantially complied \npolicy action 6). Selection of the software vendor for the web portal is not a difficult reform, and \nwill  be  completed  soon  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  and  procurement  support.  The  other  substantially \ncomplied policy action deals with budget allocation of TJS80 million for subsidies to low income \nconsumers to mitigate the impact of tariff increases in 2017 (policy action 9). The government has \nallocated TJS69.4 million (Table 3), representing a sharp rise of 61.4% over 2016 amount (TJS43 \nmillion).  The  government  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to carrying  out  the  reforms  to  their \nlogical conclusion in these two areas. \n \n13. \nSubprogram  2  was  developed  as  a follow  up  on  subprogram  1.  Many  of  the  structural \nshortcomings in Tajikistan\u2019s economy\u2014low competitiveness of products in particular\u2014reflect the \nlimited  progress  in  expanding  its  productive capabilities  and in tapping  economic  opportunities \nthat  create  more  wealth.  Binding  constraints  to  private  investment  include  an  unfavorable \nbusiness  environment,  unreliable  access  to  electricity  (particularly  during  the  winter),  poor \ntransport  connectivity  with  external  markets,  and  limited  integration  with  global  sources  of \nknowledge. Since 2016, access to finance has also emerged as a binding constraint, given the \ncredit crunch associated with the deteriorating solvency and liquidity in the banks. A programmatic \napproach with three separate subprograms was launched to address these binding constraints. \n \n14. \nSubprogram 2 seeks to consolidate the gains made during subprogram 1. It is targeted at \nimproving  the  ease  of  doing  business  by  addressing  the  constraints  in  three  areas:  (i)  poor \ninfrastructure, (ii) limited integration with global sources of knowledge, and (iii) weak institutional \nstructure.  \n \n15. \nSignificant  achievements  have  been  seen  in  several  key  areas,  such  as  a  reduction  in \ninspection  bodies,  a  reduction  in  taxes,  transparency  in  government  acts  and  incentives,  and \nstrengthened  microcredit.  These  steps  forward  were  possible  because  the  government  took \nownership to ensure that the reforms  were implemented successfully. Implementation of some \npolicy actions and two loan effectiveness conditions were challenging and required support and \ncoordination across several line ministries and development partners, which caused delays. ADB \nprovided strong support to (i) set up the web portal (policy action 6), (ii) select the management \npersonnel for the microcredit refinance fund (policy action 12),6 and (iii) design the fiscal strategy \n\n                                                \n5  Some of these adjustment costs include higher budget allocations for (i) the refinancing credit fund for financing rural \nbusinesses and farmers; (ii) government institutions, to pay for higher electricity tariffs arising from the reduction of \nimplicit subsidies in the tariffs; (iii) the low-income population to compensate for higher electricity costs; and (iv) the \nEntrepreneurship Support Fund for financing of businesses. \n\n6  A recruitment agency was hired for this purpose. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\npaper.  These  were  extremely  time-intensive  initiatives.  The  government  accomplished  the \nenormous task of completing the AQRs of five banks. Despite these delays, the achievements \nwere the result of proactive steps taken by the executing agency staff and strong support from \nthe senior staff of the government\u2019s Finance Department.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n16. \nIn view of the substantial progress made in implementing subprogram 2 of the Investment \nClimate Reforms Program, as demonstrated by (i) full compliance with 11 policy actions, and two \nloan  effectiveness  conditions;  (ii)  substantial  compliance with  two  policy  actions,  the  President \nrecommends that the Board approve, on a no objection basis, \n  \n\nthe  waiver  of  full  compliance  for  two  tranche  release  conditions  based  on  the \nachievement of substantial compliance of policy actions 6 and 9 under subprogram \n2, and \nthe release of the loan in the amount of $50 million7 for the subprogram 2 of the \nInvestment Climate Reforms Program in Tajikistan. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n7  Consisting  of  Loan  3513-TAJ  in  the  amount  of  SDR22,433,000,  and  Grant  0530-TAJ  in  the  amount  of \n\nUSD19,240,000. \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 13 October 2017) \n", "Currency Unit \nTJS1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "somoni (TJS) \n$0.113 \nTJS8.796 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nasset quality review \ngross domestic product \npublic investment project \nregulatory impact analysis \n", "ADB \nAQR \nGDP \nPIP \nRIA \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars. \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "W.
