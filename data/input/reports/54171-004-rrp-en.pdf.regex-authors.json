THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Second  Health  System \nEnhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility.1 \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for the additional financing of the Second Health System \nEnhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the AIIB loan.  \n \n2.  The additional financing of the Second Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit \nCOVID-19 under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (HEAL2-AF) builds on the original \nproject and will expand the Philippines\u2019 procurement and deployment of coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) vaccines. It will support the government\u2019s procurement of at least 40 million additional \ndoses of COVID-19 vaccines for eligible children, and third and booster shots for the wider \npopulation.2 The HEAL2-AF complements the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Health System \nEnhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 (HEAL) project, which supports the government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  On 11 March 2021, ADB approved a regular loan of $400 million for HEAL2 to be financed \nfrom its ordinary capital resources.4 HEAL2 is cofinanced by AIIB with a loan of $300 million, \npartially administered by ADB. HEAL2 provided the Government of the Philippines with timely \nfinancing for procurement of safe and effective vaccines and related logistics, based on an agreed \nlist of eligible expenditures. In total, with a major change in scope of HEAL (footnote 3), ADB has \nprovided $425 million for COVID-19 vaccine procurement and deployment. \n \n4.  Performance of the Second Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit \nCOVID-19 project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility. HEAL2 is performing well \nand is rated on track against the following criteria: progress in achieving outputs, contract awards, \ndisbursement, financial risk management, and safeguards compliance.5 Against an elapsed time \nof 18% as of 13 November 2021, cumulative contract awards under the ADB and AIIB loans are \n$688.3 million (98% of total financing) and cumulative disbursements are $567.11 million (81% of \ntotal financing). HEAL2 has supported the procurement of 85.6 million doses of vaccines through \nbilateral agreements, of which 61.19 million doses have been delivered to the country. Out of the \n$25 million reallocated for vaccine financing under the first HEAL (footnote 3), $19.2 million or \n77% was utilized as advance payment for Pfizer vaccines; and the remainder was committed for \nthe procurement of micro-syringes, diluent, and mixing syringes also for Pfizer vaccines. The \n \n1  ADB. Philippines: Second Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 under the Asia Pacific \nVaccine Access Facility.  \n2  The Philippine government currently defines eligible children for COVID-19 vaccination as those aged 12-17 years \nold. Third and booster shots are additional doses of vaccines needed periodically to boost the immune system. \n3  ADB. Philippines: Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19; and ADB. 2021.

The major change \nexpanded the scope of the first HEAL to reallocate part of the loan proceeds ($25 million) to vaccine procurement.  \n4  The ADB loan agreement was signed on 19 March 2021 and became effective on 15 April 2021.  \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "2 \ndelivery of the expected outputs is rated successful. Project covenants, including safeguard \ncovenants, have either been complied with or are being complied with; and the management of \nproject implementation risks, including financial management risks, is rated successful.  \n \n5.  Modality. The proposed HEAL2-AF builds on HEAL2 to procure safe and effective \nCOVID-19 vaccines, and will support the government in boosting health security. Additional \nfinancing is the most suitable modality, as the proposed HEAL2-AF will scale up the scope of the \nongoing project, follow the same design and implementation arrangements, and assist the \ngovernment in speedy and efficient procurement of additional vaccine doses. HEAL2-AF meets \nthe eligibility criteria for additional financing as it remains technically feasible, economically viable, \nand financially sound; is a high government priority; and is consistent with HEAL2 development \nobjectives and with the country partnership strategy for the Philippines.6 \n \n6.  Strategic alignment. The HEAL2-AF continues to be aligned with the government\u2019s \nstrategy to promote high and inclusive growth, and pillar 3 of the country partnership strategy on \ninvesting  in  people.  It  is  also  aligned  with  the  following  operational  priorities  of  ADB's \nStrategy 2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, and (iii) fostering regional cooperation and integration.7  \n \nBox 1: Snapshot of COVID-19 Vaccinations in the Philippines \n \n1.  About 195,000,000 doses procured, of which 121,979,340 doses delivered (as of 13 November 2021). \n(i)  HEAL2 financed 61,192,292 doses or 47.91% of all delivered doses. \n(ii)  National government-procured vaccines (using both budget and multilateral development bank \nfinancing) which have been delivered to the country comprise Sinovac (47,600,000 doses), Pfizer \n(19,094,400 doses), Sputnik (7,195,000 doses), and Moderna (4,734,580 doses). \n(iii) Donated vaccines delivered to the country are from COVAX, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the \nUnited States and comprise Pfizer (14,759,550 doses), AstraZeneca (11,271,640 doses), Janssen \n(3,240,850 doses), Moderna (3,000,060 doses), Sinopharm (1,100,000 doses), and Sinovac \n(2,000,000 doses). \n(iv) Vaccines procured and delivered by the private sector and local governments are AstraZeneca \n(4,832,000 doses), Moderna (2,251,260 doses), and Sinovac (900,000 doses).  \n2.  Nationally, 39.51% of adults (all those aged 18 and above comprising 70% of the total population) is \nfully vaccinated, with another 12.27% of adults partly vaccinated (as of 10 November 2021). \n(i)  About 27.66% of the country\u2019s total population is fully vaccinated.  \n(ii)  In Metro Manila, 91.10% of its adults are fully vaccinated (equivalent to 63.77% of Metro Manila\u2019s \ntotal population). \n(iii) Less than 25.00% of adults is fully vaccinated in two regions (Region 5 and the Bangsamoro \nAutonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao). \n3.

Status of the pandemic in the Philippines. Since the Department of Health (DOH) \nconfirmed local transmission of COVID-19 in March 2020, the number of confirmed cases has \nsignificantly increased. The country experienced three spikes in August 2020, March\u2013April 2021, \nand  August\u2013September  2021  (Figure).  The  third  spike  was  largely  driven  by  the  more \ntransmissible Delta variant, resulting in daily new confirmed cases reaching nearly 200 per million \nin mid-September 2021. However, the daily test positivity rate, the number of positive tests per \nnumber of daily tests conducted, which reached 25% in mid-September has now declined to less \nthan 7%. The seven-day rolling average daily new cases per million have decreased to 16.27 on \n16 November compared to Indonesia\u2019s 1.33 and Thailand\u2019s 98.45 (Figure). The cumulative total \nnumber of confirmed cases has exceeded 2.8 million as of 16 November 2021. \n \n9.  Impact on the economy and the poor. After contracting sharply by 9.6% in 2020 and by \n4.2% in the first quarter of 2021, the economy registered 11.8% growth in the second quarter of \n2021. However, there remain continuing concerns about sustaining the recovery. Unemployment \nalso remains high at 8.1% compared to 5.1% in 2019, with 3.9 million Filipinos unemployed. The \naverage work hours declined sharply from 42.2 hours in 2019 to 35.0 hours in April 2021. The \npoor  and  vulnerable  Filipinos,  employed  largely  in  the  informal  sector  and  lower  wage \noccupations, have suffered more serious job losses.

Impact on gender. Gender-based violence, the burden of unpaid care and domestic work, \nand limited access to sexual and reproductive health provisions are among many gendered \nimpacts of COVID-19 that are increasingly felt more than a year into the pandemic. Before the \npandemic, one in four married Filipino women aged 15\u201349 years reported enduring physical, \nsexual, and/or emotional violence.9 At the onset of COVID-19, every month of quarantine or \nlockdown  generated  an  estimated  additional  12,000  gender-based  violence  cases,  mostly \nunreported or underreported.10 The Philippine National Police noted that during lockdowns and \nquarantines,  the  Women  and  Children\u2019s  Desks  were  reported  to  have  processed  at  least \n12 complaints per week\u2014more than twice the number before the COVID-19 pandemic.11  \n \n11.   Impact on the health system. The government has continuously enhanced its capacities \nfor testing, tracing, isolating, and treating COVID-19 cases.12 The bed capacity of health facilities \nhas increased, especially in hospitals in the National Capital Region.13 Despite this, health \nfacilities were overwhelmed by the increased cases from August to September 2021. During this \nperiod, COVID-19-dedicated isolation facilities, intensive care units, and ward beds were, on \naverage, at 70% occupancy nationally. The National Capital Region was the most affected, with \n67% of isolation beds occupied, 78% of intensive care units full, and 73% ward occupancy.14  \n \n \n8  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2021.

In March 2021, the Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination \nPlan for COVID-19 Vaccines (PNDVP) prioritized vaccinating up to 70 million Filipinos aged 18 \nyears and above before the end of 2021, and all Filipinos by 2023. As of 10 November 2021, the \nPhilippines  had  fully  vaccinated  more  than  30.49 million  people,  or  27.66%  of  the  entire \npopulation. Another about 9.46 million people have also been partially vaccinated with one dose. \nAbout 96.49% of the estimated 1.58 million frontline health care workers and 84.75% of the target \npopulation with comorbidities have been fully vaccinated. However, the government needs to \nscale up the vaccination of older persons, as only 59.68% (90.13% in Metro Manila) of the \nestimated population aged 60 years and older have been fully vaccinated. The government also \nneeds to ramp up vaccination in two regions (Region 5 and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of \nMuslim Mindanao) where local government units (LGUs) have only fully vaccinated less than 25% \nof their adult population.  \n \n13.  Updates on national vaccine procurement, prioritization, and allocation plans. As of \n13  November  2021,  about  195  million  vaccine  doses  have  been  procured  through  the \ngovernment\u2019s own resources; donations; loans from development partners including ADB, AIIB, \nand the World Bank; and LGUs and the private sector (Table 2). Out of this, 121,979,340 doses \nhave been delivered to the country. The 195 million doses will be sufficient to vaccinate 77.14 \nmillion Filipinos (original target was 70 million), which requires about 154.28 million doses. The \nremaining 40 million doses can potentially vaccinate the newly eligible population of children aged \n12\u201317 years, estimated at 13 million, provided that the remaining donated vaccines from COVAX \nare delivered in a timely manner and the current low wastage rate of less than 1% is sustained.15  \n  \nTable 2: Philippines: Vaccine Supply Contracts and Donations  \nDeliveries   Total  \nSources of Vaccine Supply  as of 13 November 2021  Expected Doses  \nDonations (COVAX and bilateral)  35,372,100     50,123,220a \nNational government-procured   78,623,980  121,130,000 \nLGU and private sector-procured  7,983,260  24,121,990 \n  Total  121,979,340  195,375,210 \nCOVAX = COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, LGU = local government unit. \na  The total number of doses expected from donations assumes that COVAX will fulfil its commitment to deliver \naround 44 million doses.

The uncertainty in vaccine supply delivery continues to raise concerns that the doses \ncontracted will not be adequate to ensure full vaccine security for Filipinos. Specifically, the \nongoing spike in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant and concerns over waning vaccine-\ninduced immunity have aggravated those concerns and led the government to adopt a four-\npronged  approach:  (i) accelerate  the  pace  of  vaccination,  (ii)  introduce  booster  doses, \n(iii) commence and expedite the vaccination of 12- to 17-year-olds, and (iv) begin the vaccination \nof children under 12 years old. The government\u2019s plan is similar to the plans being pursued by \nseveral countries (e.g., India, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to deal with \nthe Delta strain and other possible emerging strains.16 The government has begun vaccinating \n12- to 17-year-olds in October 2021, starting with those who have comorbidities footnote 15). It \nwill adopt policies on booster doses and include children under 12 years of age in its vaccination \n \n15 Government of the Philippines, DOH. 2021.

To  ensure  adequate  financing  for \nadditional doses (particularly booster doses and primary for eligible children), the DOH has \nproposed  a  budget  of  \u20b145 billion  (about  $900  million)  for  COVID-19  vaccines  in  2022  as \nunprogrammed funds.17 If this budget request is approved, and external funding is mobilized, the \nDOH can procure about 81.8 million additional doses (at an average cost of \u20b1544 per dose) in \n2022 to provide booster doses in general for all Filipinos as per the allocation policy. In addition, \nthe doses can be used to vaccinate 12- to 17-year-olds who may not be covered by the currently \nexpected vaccine supply of 195 million doses. They can also be used to vaccinate children under \n12 years of age if and when the government authorizes their vaccination.18  \n   \n16.  Updates on the vaccine information management system. After a delay of nearly two \nmonths, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) launched the \nvaccine information management system (VIMS) in late April 2021. VIMS has four key parts: \n(i) the collection and aggregation of master lists of the eligible population for vaccination with the \nVIMS immunization registry, (ii) Vaccine Operations Reporting System (VORS) which includes \ncapturing  aggregate  reports  of  administered  vaccine  doses  and  vaccine  supply  chain \nmanagement data, (iii) vaccine administration data collected in real time through the DICT vaccine \nadministration system (DVAS) or by the uploading of line lists, and (iv) digital vaccine certificates \nunder VaxCertPH. The DICT aggregates LGUs\u2019 vaccination-eligibility master lists in the VIMS \nimmunization registry, but VIMS\u2019 delayed launch has resulted in many LGU master lists still to be \naggregated. The VIMS supply chain tool communicates vaccine allocation decisions to LGU \nvaccine administration sites. Cities and provinces submit aggregated data through VORS, and \nindividual-level vaccine administration data, either by uploading them directly or through DVAS. \nWhile 100% of aggregated data from LGUs have been submitted directly to VORS, uploading of \nindividual-level records need to catch up as only around of 83% of individual records have been \nuploaded in the VIMS database as of 25 October 2021. In addition to the VIMS, the government \nuses Vigiflow to track adverse events after immunization with the COVID-19 vaccine.19  \n \n17.  Updates on national and local government unit coordination. The National Task \nForce against COVID-19 (NTF) leads overall COVID-19 vaccination allocation and distribution \ncoordination. The NTF holds daily allocation meetings with stakeholders from all LGUs; the DOH; \nthe private sector; related working teams (including the track and trace teams of DOH Centers of \nHealth Development, and DICT inventory reporting teams); and other stakeholders, including \nADB. The daily meetings focus on vaccine performance and ensuring immediate responses to \nvaccine stock shortages in LGUs. To increase the number of doses administered by LGUs, the \nNTF, DOH, and the Department of the Interior and Local Government have intensified monitoring \nof LGUs that could not meet vaccine administration targets. Administrative sanctions that may be \nimposed, if warranted, on officials of poorly performing LGUs, have been prepared. They also \ncontinue to harness the private sector to supplement LGU vaccine administration. \n \n17  Such funds represent budget line items that need to be financed from external resources, such as loans from ADB \nand other multilateral development banks, or government revenues generated beyond those projected for 2022. \n18  If the government decides that booster shots will be provided with the same vaccine(s) as the original shots, then it \nneeds to procure all seven vaccines that have been administered to Filipinos. If booster shots may be provided with \ndifferent types of vaccines, the government may procure only two or three types of vaccines as booster shots. \n19 Vigiflow is a web-based data management system for individual case safety reports, supported by Uppsala \nMonitoring Centre, an independent non-profit foundation endorsed by WHO. The government has been using \nVigiflow to trace adverse events from all types of vaccinations since pre-COVID-19.  \n \n \n ", "7 \n18.  Updates on vaccine supply and logistics. The DOH has established a robust process \nto ensure the safety, efficiency, and quality of vaccines from the point of manufacture to pre-\nshipment; arrival; delivery; inspection and acceptance at the warehouse and cold storage facility, \nand vaccination sites; and final disposal of vaccine vials and immunization wastes. Upon arrival \nin the country, the vaccines are initially shipped to DOH-managed or contracted third-party private \nwarehouses and then forwarded to DOH regional warehouses or directly to LGU-approved \nvaccination sites or LGU-contracted third-party private warehouses. The DOH and NTF are \nincreasing  their  visibility  of  the  daily  vaccine  inventories  across  provinces,  cities,  and \nmunicipalities to ensure continued vaccine availability in LGUs.  \n19.  Updates  on  vaccine  communication.  The  DOH  launched  the  COVID-19 \ncommunications  campaign  (Resbakuna)  to  promote  vaccine  acceptance;  address  vaccine \nhesitancy; and communicate vaccine-related information, including potential adverse events, \nvaccine efficacy, and the eligibility of target population groups. Audience segmentation is carried \nout following demographic and programmatic variables including prioritization, which in turn \ninforms  the  messaging  and  production  of  communication  materials.  To  ensure  maximum \ncoverage, both above-the-line (i.e., TV, radio, print, and digital) and below-the-line (i.e., town hall \nand  community  meetings)  communication  channels  are  used.  Population  surveys,  social \nlistening, regular stakeholder consultations, and specially commissioned research are used to \nmonitor campaign performance. National surveys tracking public sentiment toward COVID-19 \nvaccination have shown an increasing trend in vaccine acceptance. In the latest Social Weather \nStation\u2019s survey of September 2021, respondents who would refuse COVID-19 vaccines (18%) \nor remain undecided (18%) cited safety as the most common concern.20 Other concerns are on \nthe effectiveness of vaccines and the belief that vaccinations are not needed against COVID-19. \nRefusal of vaccination is highest in Visayas and Mindanao, and among non-elementary school \ngraduates. The DOH will continue to address concerns on vaccine safety and effectiveness. \n \n20.  Lessons learned. Key lessons from HEAL2 and the Philippines\u2019 national vaccination \nimplementation are as follows: (i) adopt an agile approach to vaccine communication and health \npromotion including the use of behavioral science in designing interventions; (ii) ensure adequate \nupfront  planning  for  building  up  local  government  readiness;  (iii)  strengthen  institutional \narrangements and organizational capacities in DOH and other national agencies given the fast \npace of vaccine deployment and administration; (iv) build effective coordination mechanisms \nbetween national and local governments and the private sector; and (v) ensure accurate vaccine \ninformation management and reporting systems, and access to up-to-date dashboards which are \ncrucial to efficient and accountable vaccine deployment and administration.21  \n \n21.  Updates on development partner coordination and ADB\u2019s role. The DOH\u2019s Bureau of \nInternational Health Cooperation organizes monthly health partners\u2019 meetings such as with the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), ADB, AIIB, the \nWorld Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID), the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and \nExport-Import Bank of Korea. These meetings facilitate effective coordination on various aspects \nof  accessing  and  delivering  safe  and  effective  COVID-19  vaccines.  In  addition,  USAID \ncoordinates weekly technical meetings on the Philippines\u2019 COVID-19 response, including vaccine \nrollout (logistics, information, and communication), among USAID, ADB, WHO, and the UNICEF. \nADB, AIIB, and the World Bank meet biweekly to coordinate vaccine financing and procurement \n \n20 Social Weather Stations is a private nonprofit social research institution. https://www.sws.org.ph/. \n21 Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nissues. ADB continues to play a key role in vaccine financing and technical assistance (TA) in \ncritical areas such as vaccine communications, logistics, and VIMS implementation. 22 \n \n22.  Government request for additional financing. The government has requested ADB to \nexpand its COVID-19 vaccination support program through additional financing of the ongoing \nHEAL2 to increase the procurement of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, related ancillaries, \nand logistics. The additional financing requested is $500 million\u2014$250 million from ADB and \n$250 million from AIIB. The government has also requested additional financing in the amount of \n$300 million from the World Bank, through its ongoing project for vaccine procurement.23 As \nvaccine supply in the global market is still scarce, the government has begun negotiations with \nvaccine suppliers and plans to sign contracts and make advance payments by the end of 2021. \nThis will allow the government to secure additional COVID-19 vaccine supply for 2022.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n23.  Impact and outcome. The impact and outcome of the project will remain unchanged from \nthe ongoing HEAL2. This is because the additional financing will be used for procurement of \nadditional doses for booster shots and primary doses for eligible children.  \n \n24.  Output: COVID-19 vaccines efficiently and effectively delivered. The HEAL2-AF will \nsupport the procurement of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 through APVAX \nfollowing ADB\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria. It will also finance related ancillaries and logistics. \nOutput performance indicator 1a will be adjusted to \u201cat least 150 million doses24 of COVID-19 \nvaccines procured and delivered to the country by 2024\u201d. This assumes that the HEAL2-AF will \nprovide at least 40 million additional doses of vaccines, which will be administered by 2024 based \non identified priority populations. The eligible vaccines will be procured primarily through bilateral \narrangements with vaccine manufacturers or distributors. Procurement through the COVID-19 \nVaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility will be considered once it makes vaccine doses for \nbooster shots available. With ongoing TA,25 ADB will continue to support the VIMS and the DOH\u2019s \ncommunication management and help develop and disseminate a gender- and socially inclusive \nprotocol  to  support  last-mile  vaccine  outreach  to  marginalized  older  persons,  adolescents, \nwomen, and women in especially difficult circumstances (WEDC).26  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n25.  In addition to COVID-19 vaccine financing, ADB will continue providing critical support to \nenhance the DOH\u2019s vaccine communications and health promotion strategies, and the NTF\u2019s \nvaccination-related  messages  during  the  HEAL2-AF  implementation  period.  It  is  providing \nvaccine logistics experts to support vaccine supply planning and allocation decision-making, as \nwell as cold chain system strengthening. ADB has also supported health information systems \n \n22  Sector Assessment (Summary): Vaccines (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n23  World Bank.

Building on HEAL2\u2019s good performance, enable the government to rapidly secure additional vaccine \nsupply contracts that will boost overall health security for all Filipinos, and thereby facilitate economic \nrecovery. \n2.  Increase the vaccine security of the Philippines, given concerns over the emerging variants of the \nCOVID-19 virus and with more than 98% of the HEAL2 resources already committed. \n3.  Finance the purchase of (i) booster shots to reduce risks for vulnerable segments of the population \nalready vaccinated, (ii) vaccine doses for 12- to 17-year-olds, and (iii) vaccine doses for children \nunder 12 years of age.  \n4.  Help the government accelerate the pace of vaccination, through timely availability of data via the \nVIMS, improved logistics and supply chains, and enhanced vaccine communications. \n5.

Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage loan maturity is 19 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per annum. \nThe government has made its independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility and has given an undertaking that this was not made on the basis of any advice from ADB.  \n \n28.  The government has also requested a loan of $250 million from AIIB. The AIIB loan, which \nis expected to be approved after the approval of the ADB loan, will be partially administered by \nADB. The AIIB loan will jointly cofinance supply contracts for vaccines that meet the eligibility \ncriteria under the APVAX.30 The AIIB loan\u2019s terms and conditions will be described in the loan \nagreement between AIIB and the government.31 Before the effectiveness of the AIIB loan, the \ngovernment may request advances from the ADB loan proceeds. Subsequent disbursements \nfollowing AIIB loan effectiveness will be prorated. \n \n29.  The government will contribute $49.37 million, or 8.99% of the total project cost, to cover \n$7.73 million of loan interest and charges and $41.64 million for other vaccine administration \ncosts, including injection devices, vaccine transportation, storage, waste disposal, information \nmanagement, and vaccine communication.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The DOH will continue to be the executing agency. The project management team for the \nongoing project will also be responsible for implementing the additional financing. Procurement \nwill follow the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Consistent with the APVAX policy, ADB member country \neligibility restrictions will be waived, and universal procurement will apply. Most of the vaccine \nprocurement will be jointly cofinanced with AIIB, but some may be financed exclusively by ADB \nbefore AIIB loan\u2019s effectivity. ADB will be the lead cofinancier, and its procurement policy will \napply to all procurement. The DOH will directly negotiate with vaccine manufacturers to agree on \nbilateral contracts. Before being confirmed as an eligible expenditure under the loans, ADB will \nreview the vaccine eligibility criteria and all bilateral vaccine agreements to ensure that the terms \nare acceptable to ADB. Procurement of a portion of the vaccines will be considered through the \nCOVAX facility. COVAX facility-provided vaccines are eligible under APVAX. In implementation, \nADB will closely coordinate with all other relevant development partners. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 5 and detailed in the PAM (footnote 32). \n  \nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2022\u2013March 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 September 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Department of Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency and  DOH \nImplementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit  DOH project management team  \nProcurement  Direct contracting   Multiple contracts  $456.8 million \nRequest for quotations  Multiple contracts    $43.2 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  ADB and the government will agree on the retroactive financing percentage (up \nadvance contracting  to 30%) based on the needs.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic Viability \n \n32.  The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and a social and economic crisis, causing \nincreases in morbidity and mortality, significant disruptions in human capital development, and \nmajor economic downturns. The containment measures put in place to restrain the spread of the \nvirus  have  restricted  economic  activities  and  resulted  in  an  economy-wide  slowdown  in \ninvestment and international trade. A comprehensive COVID-19 vaccination program is regarded \nas the most cost-effective public health intervention in reducing morbidity and mortality.34 The \nHEAL2-AF will support the government and the PNDVP in procuring at least 40 million additional \ndoses  of  COVID-19  vaccines.35  While  measurement  uncertainties  exist,  the  magnitude  of \neconomic gains of high coverage and high-speed COVID-19 vaccination programs is expected to \nbe enormous and far exceed any cost.36 The available COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be \nrelatively effective against severe cases and deaths, with indicative efficacy against severe cases \nof 77%\u201395%.37 Achieving PNDVP targets will avert significant productivity losses from morbidity \nand mortality and will reduce the pressure on many health facilities. The health gains will become \neconomic gains as the country resumes its economic and social activities. \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n33.  Financial sustainability analysis is not applicable as this project will not create assets that \nwill require operation and maintenance. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n34.  The financial management assessment conducted for the HEAL2 in January 2021 was \nupdated for the HEAL2-AF in September 2021. The overall pre-mitigation financial management \nrisk is downgraded from high to substantial. Under the HEAL2, the following key mitigating \nmeasures have either been completed or are being implemented: (i) assessing LGUs\u2019 capacity to \noversee vaccine deployment before distribution; (ii) setting up an asset register of cold chain \nfacilities; (iii) engaging a third-party logistics provider; (iv) formulating a contingency plan for \nfunding; (v) updating inventory management protocols; and (vi) having the Commission on Audit \nconduct performance, financial, and compliance audits with ADB assistance. While efforts are \nmitigating the risks associated with vaccine distribution and administration including inventory \nmanagement system, the pre-mitigation financial management risk remains substantial for the \nHEAL2-AF, due to the scale and complexity of the project and the fact that more than 70% of the \npopulation remain not fully vaccinated.  \n \n35.  The DOH\u2019s overall procurement capacity is limited. It continues to face unprecedented \ndemand placed by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is straining its capacity. Its \nknowledge and experience in applying ADB procurement policies and regulations remain limited \nas the first HEAL began only in 2020. For vaccine procurement, it continues to be supported by \nthe NTF. Even with this support and the considerable experience gained from negotiating with \n \n34  N. Laurie et al. 2020.

ADB will \ncontinue assisting the DOH in vaccine procurement by providing advice on the market and \nassociated procurement-related risks, reviewing contracts under bilateral agreements, supporting \nwith price validation, and assisting in preparations for negotiations with vaccine manufacturers.  \n \n36.  The updated Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Cluster Plan, 2013\u20132016 includes \nimproved anticorruption measures as one of four priority outcomes. Sub-outcomes include greater \naccountability of public servants and intensified efforts to prevent smuggling and tax evasion. The \nCommission on Audit developed a website to serve as a repository of project reports, cluster \nupdates,  and  other  publications and  related  documents.  As  a  result  of  the  government\u2019s \nanticorruption  efforts,  the  Philippines  placed  115th  out  of  180  economies  in  Transparency \nInternational\u2019s 2020  Corruption  Perception  Index.  Given citizens\u2019  increasing  expectation  of \nimproved governance, the anticorruption mechanism needs to be strengthened. The Philippines\u2019 \nintegrity  and  governance  risks  have  been  considered  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.38 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the executing and implementing agencies.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  Poverty and social. ADB had estimated that, without substantial financial support to the \npoor and near poor families, the poverty rate could increase to 20.7% in 2020 from 16.7% in 2018, \nas a result of the pandemic\u2019s effects on incomes.39 The Philippine Institute for Development \nStudies had estimated that 1.4 million families, or 7.5 million individuals, will become poor \nbecause of the pandemic\u2019s impact. The implementation of the social amelioration program has \nmitigated the poverty impacts and reduced the number of families expected to become poor to \n0.4 million families or 2.8 million individuals.40 The planned reopening of schools (partly due to \nvaccination) will also reduce the productivity losses from the lack of face-to-face schooling.  \n \n38.  Gender. The HEAL2-AF is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The HEAL2 \ngender action plan will remain in effect as the HEAL2-AF will support last-mile vaccine outreach \nto WEDC and people in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas. The HEAL2-AF will \ncontinue to support the gender- and socially inclusive protocols and dissemination plan, as well \nas the communication and messaging initiatives  and consultations. Under the  HEAL2, the \ngovernment has approved and begun implementing a prioritization framework on COVID-19 \nvaccine centers, with consideration for pregnant women and the poor. With the prioritization \nframework, complemented by ADB TA on developing vaccine communication strategies (footnote \n35), the coverage of inoculated pregnant women and the poor will increase, and the development \nand dissemination of the gender- and socially inclusive protocol for marginalized older persons, \nadolescents, WEDC, and geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas will be accelerated.  \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n39.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.41 \n \n38 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 ADB.

The HEAL2-AF will support the procurement of additional \nvaccines and will not entail civil works or other activities with potential for significant adverse \nimpacts on the environment. The distribution and use of COVID-19 vaccines will result in a \ntemporary increase in immunization waste generation.42 An immunization waste management \nsystem is in place, consistent with regulatory requirements, and is considered satisfactory to \naddress risks to occupational and community health and safety.43 Used vaccine vials, syringes, \nand related waste are either treated and disposed of on-site following procedures defined in the \nDOH Health Care Waste Management Manual; or collected by a licensed third-party reverse \nlogistics firm contracted by the DOH for off-site treatment and disposal.44 The movement of \nimmunization waste off-site through the existing Hazardous Waste Manifest System complies with \nlicensing, reporting, and monitoring rules. The DOH has established and is implementing a \nmonitoring framework to verify compliance with immunization waste management requirements.  \n \n41.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  HEAL2-AF  will  not  require  any  land \nacquisition or lead to any resettlement impacts. \n  \n42.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The HEAL2-AF is not expected to have any direct or \nindirect impacts on the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, \nor the territories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or \nclaim as an ancestral domain or asset. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n43.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 38). ADB will continue to work \nwith the DOH, NTF, other development partners, and civil society organizations in monitoring the \nrollout of the vaccination and mitigation measures. \n \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nCountry-specific.

Manila. \nd  The government has set target groups and prioritized eligible populations for the vaccination program in line with the \nWHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and its values framework for the allocation and \nprioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, and the Philippines\u2019 country context. Group A (estimated at 24.7 million or \n23% of the total population), the first target group, prioritizes frontline health workers, indigent older persons, \nremaining older persons and indigent populations, and uniformed personnel. Group B, the second target group (up \nto 44% of the total population), covers teachers and social workers; other government workers (national and local); \nother essential workers outside health, education, and social sectors; socio-demographic groups at significant risk \nother than older persons and indigent populations (persons with disability, persons deprived of liberty, persons living \nin high-density areas); overseas Filipino workers; and the remaining Filipino workforce (as may be determined by \ngovernment agencies). Group C are the remaining Filipinos not included in Group A or Group B. \ne  A total of at least 150 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines are to be procured under the HEAL2 and the HEAL2-AF. \nThe coverage of 50 million Filipinos assumes a waste rate of 10%. The coverage would not increase as the additional \nfinancing will be also used for booster shots. The indicator was revised to remove \u201cup to\u201d to enable an objective \nassessment of the achievement and to adjust the target value correspondingly to reflect new information about \nvaccine dose costs.  \nf  This includes 44 million doses from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX). The additional financing will \nprocure at least 40 million doses; hence, the target increases from 110 million to 150 million doses. This target value \nof 150 million is based on price estimates and planned procurement at the time of the HEAL2 and HEAL2-AF \npreparation. \ng  Output indicators 1b and 1c will be financed by the following TA projects: ADB. 2020.

Manila. \nh  In alignment with the WHO SAGE equity principle, these protocols and guidelines acknowledge that specific groups \nof the population are less able to access information and services than others. To ensure broad-based coverage of \ninformation and equity in vaccine access, the gender- and socially inclusive protocols and guidelines will specifically \ntarget marginalized women, women in especially difficult circumstances, and people in geographically isolated and \ndisadvantaged areas as defined by the Magna Carta of Women, Sections 4 (d) and 30. The selected LGUs in big \ncities or geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas will be determined during the inception mission. \nContribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities: \nThe expected values and methodological details for all OP indicators to which this project will contribute results are \ndetailed in Contribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "18  Appendix 2 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54171-004-3   \n \n1.
